3184,Low acclimation capacity of narrow‐ranging thermal specialists exposes susceptibility to global climate change,2018-04-15,"Thermal acclimation is hypothesized to offer a selective advantage in seasonal habitats and may underlie disparities in geographic range size among closely‐related species with similar ecologies. Understanding this relationship is also critical for identifying species that are more sensitive to warming climates. Here, we study North American plethodontid salamanders to investigate whether acclimation ability is associated with species’ latitudinal extents and the thermal range of the environments they inhabit. We quantified variation in thermal physiology by measuring standard metabolic rate (SMR) at different test and acclimation temperatures for 16 species of salamanders with varying latitudinal extents. A phylogenetically‐controlled Markov chain Monte Carlo generalized linear mixed model (MCMCglmm) was then employed to determine whether there are differences in SMR between wide‐ and narrow‐ranging species at different acclimation temperatures. In addition, we tested for a relationship between the acclimation ability of species and the environmental temperature ranges they inhabit. Further, we investigated if there is a trade‐off between critical thermal maximum (CTMax) and thermal acclimation ability. MCMCglmm results show a significant difference in acclimation ability between wide and narrow‐ranging temperate salamanders. Salamanders with wide latitudinal distributions maintain or slightly increase SMR when subjected to higher test and acclimation temperatures, whereas several narrow‐ranging species show significant metabolic depression. We also found significant, positive relationships between acclimation ability and environmental thermal range, and between acclimation ability and CTMax. Wide‐ranging salamander species exhibit a greater capacity for thermal acclimation than narrow‐ranging species, suggesting that selection for acclimation ability may have been a key factor enabling geographic expansion into areas with greater thermal variability. Further, given that narrow‐ranging salamanders are found to have both poor acclimation ability and lower tolerance to warm temperatures, they are likely to be more susceptible to environmental warming associated with anthropogenic climate change.","Markle, Tricia M.; Kozak, Kenneth H.",Ecol Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5938462/,394
6279,An analysis of sources of risk in the consumer electronics industry,2007-07-04,"Outbreaks of viral respiratory disease in institutions may be associated with high morbidity and mortality, depending upon the viral etiology and the age and immune status of the affected patients. Control of outbreaks may include isolation and/or cohorting, and prohylaxis or treatment with specific antiviral agents may be indicated, all dependent upon the specific cause of the outbreak. Conventional methods of viral diagnosis detect only a limited number of the viruses that are known to cause outbreaks. The availability of sensitive and specific molecular assays has facilitated rapid diagnosis of a wider range of viruses from respiratory outbreaks. Molecular methods have distinct advantages over conventional methods, including the ability to rapidly develop assays for emerging viruses and new variants of existing viruses. In addition, molecular testing allows rapid detection of resistance to antiviral agents or mutations leading to increased virulence. However, high-throughput molecular testing requires batch processes that may compromise the ability to respond quickly to urgent testing demands.","Antonishyn, Nick A.; Levett, Paul N.",Mol Diagn Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7099217/,394

Rotaviruses were demonstrated by stool electron microscopy (EM) in 132 of these cases (25·4 per cent), but in none of io8 age- and sex-matched controls. Non-specific cases, where no potentially pathogenic organism could be demonstrated in stools submitted for EM, viral and bacterial culture accounted for 46 per cent of cases. If EM of the stools had not been performed the proportion of non-specific cases would have risen to 85 per cent, thus demonstrating the importance of this technique in diagnosis. Rotaviruses were most commonly found in winter and between the ages of six and eighteen months. A history of contact with an adult with diarrheoa, vomiting occuring before diarrhoea, accompanying upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), otitis media and pyrexia and the need for administration of intravenous fluids were all significantly more prominent features of the rotavirus than the non-specific cases of gastroenteritis, and are suggested as pointers to such a diagnosis. Pneumonia is described in three patients as an accompanying illness with rotavirus gastroenteritis.","McCormack, J.G.",J Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133613/,394

10578,Amenity Migration and Public Lands: Rise of the Protected Areas,2020-04-27,"Remyelination failure plays an important role in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis, but the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. We now report actively demyelinating lesions in patients with multiple sclerosis are associated with increased glial expression of fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9), which we demonstrate inhibits myelination and remyelination in vitro. This inhibitory activity is associated with the appearance of multi-branched ‘pre-myelinating’ MBP(+)/PLP(+) oligodendrocytes that interact with axons but fail to assemble myelin sheaths; an oligodendrocyte phenotype described previously in chronically demyelinated multiple sclerosis lesions. This inhibitory activity is not due to a direct effect of FGF9 on cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage but is mediated by factors secreted by astrocytes. Transcriptional profiling and functional validation studies demonstrate that these include effects dependent on increased expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-sensitive proteases, enzymes more commonly associated with extracellular matrix remodelling. Further, we found that FGF9 induces expression of Ccl2 and Ccl7, two pro-inflammatory chemokines that contribute to recruitment of microglia and macrophages into multiple sclerosis lesions. These data indicate glial expression of FGF9 can initiate a complex astrocyte-dependent response that contributes to two distinct pathogenic pathways involved in the development of multiple sclerosis lesions. Namely, induction of a pro-inflammatory environment and failure of remyelination; a combination of effects predicted to exacerbate axonal injury and loss in patients.","Lindner, Maren; Thümmler, Katja; Arthur, Ariel; Brunner, Sarah; Elliott, Christina; McElroy, Daniel; Mohan, Hema; Williams, Anna; Edgar, Julia M.; Schuh, Cornelia; Stadelmann, Christine; Barnett, Susan C.; Lassmann, Hans; Mücklisch, Steve; Mudaliar, Manikhandan; Schaeren-Wiemers, Nicole; Meinl, Edgar; Linington, Christopher",Brain,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7185739/,394

13193,US primary care in 2029: A Delphi survey on the impact of machine learning,2020-10-08,"BACKGROUND: Opioid (OPD), sedative (SDT), and antidepressant (ADM) prescribing has increased dramatically over the last 20 years. This study evaluated preoperative OPD, SDT, and ADM use on hospital costs in patients undergoing colorectal resection at a single institution. METHODS: This study was a retrospective record review. The local ACS-NSQIP database was queried for adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) undergoing open/laparoscopic, partial/total colectomy, or proctectomy from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2016. Individual patient medical records were reviewed to determine preoperative OPD, SDT, and AD use. Hospital cost data from index admission were captured by the hospital cost accounting system and matched to NSQIP query-identified cases. All ACS-NSQIP categorical patient characteristic, operative risk, and outcome variables were compared in medication groups using chi-square tests or Fisher’s exact tests, and continuous variables were compared using Mann–Whitney U tests. RESULTS: A total of 1185 colorectal procedures were performed by 30 different surgeons. Of these, 27.6% patients took OPD, 18.5% SDT, and 27.8% ADM preoperatively. Patients taking OPD, SDT, and ADM were found to have increased mean total hospital costs (MTHC) compared to non-users (30.8 vs 23.6 for OPD, 31.6 vs 24.4 for SDT, and 30.7 vs 23.8 for ADM). OPD and SDT use were identified as independent risk factors for increased MTHC on multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION: Preoperative OPD and SDT use can be used to predict increased MTHC in patients undergoing colorectal resections.","Jackson, Nicholas A.; Gan, Tong; Davenport, Daniel L.; Oyler, Doug R.; Ebbitt, Laura M.; Evers, B.

Genome sequence comparisons showed all these sequences correspond to the novel Biv group from which no confirmed representatives were published in GenBank. Molecular recombination analyses using recombination detection software (i.e., RDP5 and SimPlot) and phylogenetic analyses suggest multiple past recombination events in open reading frame (ORF)1a, ORF1b, and ORF2. Our findings suggest that recombination events and the accumulation of point mutations may have contributed to the substantial genetic variation observed in CAstV and evidenced by the current seven antigenic sub-clusters hitherto described. This is the first paper that describes recombination events in CAstV following analysis of complete CAstV sequences originated in Canada.","Palomino-Tapia, Victor; Mitevski, Darko; Inglis, Tom; van der Meer, Frank; Martin, Emily; Brash, Marina; Provost, Chantale; Gagnon, Carl A.; Abdul-Careem, Mohamed Faizal",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7600043/,394

This prompted us to perform a literature survey applying the MEDLINE database and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials including clinical trials comparing different treatment regimens for infections caused by carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae. Our survey revealed that a combined application of antibiotic compounds such as meropenem plus vaborbactam, meropenem plus colistin and carbapenem plus carbapenem, resulted in significantly increased clinical cure and decreased mortality rates as compared to respective control treatment. However, further research on novel antibiotic compounds, but also on antibiotic-independent molecules providing synergistic or at least resistance-modifying properties needs to be undertaken in vitro as well as in large clinical trials to provide future options in the combat of emerging life-threatening infections caused by MDR bacteria.","BANDICK, RASMUS G.; MOUSAVI, SORAYA; BERESWILL, STEFAN; HEIMESAAT, MARKUS M.",Eur J Microbiol Immunol (Bp),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7592515/,394

We assessed predictors of survival to transplantation and post-transplant mortality. RECENT FINDINGS: The number of lung transplants performed worldwide is increasing. This is accompanied by an increase in the type of patients being transplanted, including sicker patients with more advanced disease. Consequently, there is an increase in the need for bridging strategies, with varying success. Several predictors of failure have been identified. Major risk factors include retransplantation, other organ dysfunction, and deconditioning. SUMMARY: ECLS is a risky strategy but necessary for patients who would otherwise die if not bridged to transplantation. The presence of predictors for failure is not a contraindication for bridging. However, major risk factors should be approached cautiously. Other, more minor risk factors may be considered acceptable. More importantly, the strategy should be individualized for each patient to achieve the best possible outcomes.","Nasir, Basil S.; Klapper, Jacob; Hartwig, Matthew",Curr Transplant Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8021937/,394

Although deep learning approaches have shown potential in generating compounds with desired chemical properties, they disregard the cellular environment of target diseases. Bridging systems biology and drug design, we present a reinforcement learning method for de novo molecular design from gene expression profiles. We construct a hybrid Variational Autoencoder that tailors molecules to target-specific transcriptomic profiles, using an anticancer drug sensitivity prediction model (PaccMann) as reward function. Without incorporating information about anticancer drugs, the molecule generation is biased toward compounds with high predicted efficacy against cell lines or cancer types. The generation can be further refined by subsidiary constraints such as toxicity. Our cancer-type-specific candidate drugs are similar to cancer drugs in drug-likeness, synthesizability, and solubility and frequently exhibit the highest structural similarity to compounds with known efficacy against these cancer types.","Born, Jannis; Manica, Matteo; Oskooei, Ali; Cadow, Joris; Markert, Greta; Rodríguez Martínez, María",iScience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8022157/,394

The amount of data created by biological technologies needs a systematic and organized form of storage, that can quickly be accessed, and managed. This is the objective of a biological database. Here, we present an overview of human databases with web applications. The databases and tools allow the search of biological sequences, genes and genomes, gene expression patterns, epigenetic variation, protein-protein interactions, variant frequency, regulatory elements, and comparative analysis between human and model organisms. Our goal is to provide an opportunity for exploring large datasets and analyzing the data for users with little or no programming skills. Public user-friendly web-based databases facilitate data mining and the search for information applicable to healthcare professionals. Besides, biological databases are essential to improve biomedical search sensitivity and efficiency and merge multiple datasets needed to share data and build global initiatives for the diagnosis, prognosis, and discovery of new treatments for genetic diseases.

16951,Little evidence for an effect of smoking on multiple sclerosis risk: A Mendelian Randomization study,2020-11-30,"The mismatch negativity (MMN) is a key biomarker of automatic deviance detection thought to emerge from 2 cortical sources. First, the auditory cortex (AC) encodes spectral regularities and reports frequency-specific deviances. Then, more abstract representations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) allow to detect contextual changes of potential behavioral relevance. However, the precise location and time asynchronies between neuronal correlates underlying this frontotemporal network remain unclear and elusive. Our study presented auditory oddball paradigms along with “no-repetition” controls to record mismatch responses in neuronal spiking activity and local field potentials at the rat medial PFC. Whereas mismatch responses in the auditory system are mainly induced by stimulus-dependent effects, we found that auditory responsiveness in the PFC was driven by unpredictability, yielding context-dependent, comparatively delayed, more robust and longer-lasting mismatch responses mostly comprised of prediction error signaling activity. This characteristically different composition discarded that mismatch responses in the PFC could be simply inherited or amplified downstream from the auditory system. Conversely, it is more plausible for the PFC to exert top-down influences on the AC, since the PFC exhibited flexible and potent predictive processing, capable of suppressing redundant input more efficiently than the AC. Remarkably, the time course of the mismatch responses we observed in the spiking activity and local field potentials of the AC and the PFC combined coincided with the time course of the large-scale MMN-like signals reported in the rat brain, thereby linking the microscopic, mesoscopic, and macroscopic levels of automatic deviance detection.","Casado-Román, Lorena; Carbajal, Guillermo V.; Pérez-González, David; Malmierca, Manuel S.",PLoS Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7785337/,394

Evidence From an Experimental Vignette Study,2021-04-26,"By a pilot trial on investigating immunomodulatory activity and target of ginsenosides, the major bioactive components of ginseng, here we report that structural analogues in herbal medicines hit a shared target to achieve cumulative bioactivity. A ginsenoside analogues combination with definite immunomodulatory activity in vivo was designed by integrating pharmacodynamics, serum pharmacochemistry and pharmacokinetics approaches. The cumulative bioactivity of the ginsenoside analogues was validated on LPS/ATP-induced RAW264.7 macrophages. The potentially shared target NLRP3 involved in this immunomodulatory activity was predicted by systems pharmacology. The steady binding affinity between each ginsenoside and NLRP3 was defined by molecular docking and bio-layer interferometry assay. The activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes in LPS/ATP-induced RAW264.7 was significantly suppressed by the combination, but not by any individual, and the overexpression of NLRP3 counteracted the immunomodulatory activity of the combination. All these results demonstrate that the ginsenoside analogues jointly hit NLRP3 to achieve cumulative immunomodulatory activity.","Zhang, Wei; Tao, Wei-Wei; Zhou, Jing; Wu, Cheng-Ying; Long, Fang; Shen, Hong; Zhu, He; Mao, Qian; Xu, Jun; Li, Song-Lin; Wu, Qi-Nan",Commun Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8110997/,394
17503,Implementing a Virtual Midterm to Identify Unknown Bacteria in a Microbiology Lab Course,2021-03-31,"A foreign body in the respiratory tract is one of the common accidental injuries of children in our country, and is usually an important and serious event. Injuries caused by foreign substances in the respiratory tract seriously threaten the health and life of children in Korea and are a great challenge for parents as well. In the process of diagnosis of foreign bodies in the respiratory tract, there is often missed diagnosis or serious complications. Therefore, this article proposes the application of 64-slice spiral CT imaging technology based on smart medical augmented reality in the diagnosis of foreign bodies in the respiratory tract in order to improve the diagnosis of foreign bodies in the respiratory tract, provide help with treatment to improve the prognosis of foreign bodies in the respiratory tract, and reduce the incidence of foreign bodies in the respiratory tract. In this paper, 36 children underwent a 64-slice spiral CT scan of their lungs, and images were transferred to a workstation for multiplanar reconstruction, minimal density projection, three-dimensional volume reconstruction imaging, and CT virtual endoscopic reconstruction, the location, shape, size, and size of the foreign body in contrast with adjacent structural lesions and lesions seen during surgery. Experiments have shown that the left bronchial granulation accounted for 27.3%, the right bronchial granulation 18.75%, the main tracheal granulation 28.6%; there was no significant difference between the left and right bronchial granulation (P > 0.05), while the main tracheal granulation and bilateral bronchial granulation there are significant differences between the shape distributions (P < 0.05). This shows that CT imaging technology has enabled more patients to avoid surgical operations and ensure that the spiral computer can bring the greatest benefits to children. A 64-slice spiral CT scan can diagnose foreign bodies in the child's respiratory tract. The detection rate is high and the diagnostic failure rate is low. The diagnostic rationale provides a reference for early clinical treatment.","Liu, Jiewei; Wang, Ying; Zhao, Tana; Li, Chunyu; Nie, Lei",J Healthc Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8102103/,394
17733,Framing Effects on Judgments of Social Robots’ (Im)Moral Behaviors,2021-05-10,"BACKGROUND: Recently adopted mini-thoracotomy approach for surgical aortic valve replacement has shown benefits such as reduced pain and shorter recovery, compared to more conventional mini-sternotomy access. However, whether limited exposure of the heart and ascending aorta resulting from an incision in the second intercostal space may lead to increased intraoperative cerebral embolization and more prominent postoperative neurologic decline, remains inconclusive. The aim of our study was to assess potential neurological complications after two different minimal invasive surgical techniques for aortic valve replacement by measuring cerebral microembolic signal during surgery and by follow-up cognitive evaluation. METHODS: Trans-cranial Doppler was used for microembolic signal detection during aortic valve replacement performed via mini-sternotomy and mini-thoracotomy. Patients were evaluated using Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination Revised Test before and 30 days after surgical procedure. RESULTS: A total of 60 patients were recruited in the study. In 52 patients, transcranial Doppler was feasible. Of those, 25 underwent mini-sternotomy and 27 had mini-thoracotomy. There were no differences between groups with respect to sex, NYHA class distribution, Euroscore II or aortic valve area. Patients in mini-sternotomy group were younger (60.8 ± 14.4 vs.72 ± 5.84, p = 0.003), heavier (85.2 ± 12.4 vs.72.5 ± 12.9, p = 0.002) and had higher body surface area (1.98 ± 0.167 vs. 1.83 ± 0.178, p = 0.006). Surgery duration was longer in mini-sternotomy group compared to mini-thoracotomy (158 ± 24 vs. 134 ± 30 min, p < 0.001, respectively). There were no differences between groups in microembolic load, length of ICU or total hospital stay. Total microembolic signals count was correlated with cardiopulmonary bypass duration (5.64, 95%CI 0.677–10.60, p = 0.027). Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination Revised Test score decreased equivalently in both groups (p = 0.630) (MS: 85.2 ± 9.6 vs. 82.9 ± 11.4, p = 0.012; MT: 85.2 ± 9.6 vs. 81.3 ± 8.8, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: There is no difference in microembolic load between the groups. Total intraoperative microembolic signals count was associated with cardiopulmonary bypass duration.

19748,Understanding the Decision-Making Process Between Presenteeism and Absenteeism,2021-07-20,"BACKGROUND: Syndromic surveillance systems are an essential component of public health surveillance and can provide timely detection of infectious disease cases and outbreaks. Whilst surveillance systems are generally embedded within healthcare, there is increasing interest in novel data sources for monitoring trends in illness, such as over-the-counter purchases, internet-based health searches and worker absenteeism. This systematic review considers the utility of school attendance registers in the surveillance of infectious disease outbreaks and occurrences amongst children. METHODS: We searched eight databases using key words related to school absence, infectious disease and syndromic surveillance. Studies were limited to those published after 1st January 1995. Studies based in nursery schools or higher education settings were excluded. Article screening was undertaken by two independent reviewers using agreed eligibility criteria. Data extraction was performed using a standardised data extraction form. Outcomes included estimates of absenteeism, correlation with existing surveillance systems and associated lead or lag times. RESULTS: Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria, all of which were concerned with the surveillance of influenza. The specificity of absence data varied between all-cause absence, illness absence and syndrome-specific absence. Systems differed in terms of the frequency of data submissions from schools and the level of aggregation of the data. Baseline rates of illness absence varied between 2.3–3.7%, with peak absences ranging between 4.1–9.8%. Syndrome-specific absenteeism had the strongest correlation with other surveillance systems (r = 0.92), with illness absenteeism generating mixed results and all-cause absenteeism performing the least well. A similar pattern of results emerged in terms of lead and lag times, with influenza-like illness (ILI)-specific absence providing a 1–2 week lead time, compared to lag times reported for all-cause absence data and inconsistent results for illness absence data. CONCLUSION: Syndrome-specific school absences have potential utility in the syndromic surveillance of influenza, demonstrating good correlation with healthcare surveillance data and a lead time of 1–2 weeks ahead of existing surveillance measures. Further research should consider the utility of school attendance registers for conditions other than influenza, to broaden our understanding of the potential application of this data for infectious disease surveillance in children.

This iteration of the living review includes publications up to a cut-off date of 22 April 2020. Results: In total, 53 publications are included in this version of our review. Of these, 41 (77%) of the publications addressed extraction of data from abstracts, while 14 (26%) used full texts. A total of 48 (90%) publications developed and evaluated classifiers that used randomised controlled trials as the main target texts. Over 30 entities were extracted, with PICOs (population, intervention, comparator, outcome) being the most frequently extracted. A description of their datasets was provided by 49 publications (94%), but only seven (13%) made the data publicly available. Code was made available by 10 (19%) publications, and five (9%) implemented publicly available tools. Conclusions: This living systematic review presents an overview of (semi)automated data-extraction literature of interest to different types of systematic review. We identified a broad evidence base of publications describing data extraction for interventional reviews and a small number of publications extracting epidemiological or diagnostic accuracy data. The lack of publicly available gold-standard data for evaluation, and lack of application thereof, makes it difficult to draw conclusions on which is the best-performing system for each data extraction target. With this living review we aim to review the literature continually.","Schmidt, Lena; Olorisade, Babatunde K.; McGuinness, Luke A.; Thomas, James; Higgins, Julian P.

23437,Climate Change,2016-03-22,"BACKGROUND: In Turkey, a single-dose varicella vaccine was introduced into the National Immunization Program in 2013. Before this implementation, varicella vaccine had been available in the private sector since 2000. However, varicella outbreaks continued to occur in preschools and elementary schools. We investigated a varicella outbreak to estimate the effectiveness of 1-dose varicella vaccine and to evaluate potential risk factors for breakthrough disease. METHODS: This study was carried out during a varicella outbreak in 3 preschools in İzmir, Turkey, in April 2016. Using questionnaires, data including children’s medical and vaccination history were collected from their parents. Vaccination status of children was also verified with immunization records. Attack rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated children were calculated and the analysis of vaccine effectiveness and of risk factors for breakthrough disease were conducted. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated using the equation: (attack rates in unvaccinated children-attack rates in vaccinated children/ attack rates in unvaccinated children) × 100%. RESULTS: A total of 124 children were enrolled in the study. Of the 124 children, 77 (62%) had received 1-dose varicella vaccine before the outbreak. Varicella developed in 34 of 124 children during the outbreak, and 18 of them (53%) had breakthrough varicella. The attack rate was 23.4% among vaccinated children and 34% among unvaccinated children. The effectiveness of single-dose varicella vaccine was 33.6% against varicella disease of any severity and 82.5% against moderate or severe varicella. Children vaccinated 5 or more years before the outbreak had 3.5 times the risk of disease than those who had been vaccinated more recently (OR 3.5 [95% CI, 1.08–11.5]); P = 0.046). Age at vaccination (<15 months vs.≥15 months) and the brands of varicella vaccine were not associated with the increased risk of breakthrough varicella. CONCLUSION: One-dose of varicella vaccine is not sufficient to prevent school outbreaks. For this reason, varicella outbreaks continued to occur in schools and kindergartens among healthy vaccinated children in Turkey. A 2-dose varicella vaccination program may help to prevent varicella outbreaks and achieve effective control of the disease.

24243,"Aandoeningen van ademhalingsstelsel, mediastinum en thoraxwand",2014-12-15,"Community acquired pneumonia is a common illness, and pneumonia and influenza serve as the seventh leading cause of death in the United States. In the pregnant patient, pneumonia is the most common cause of fatal non-obstetric infection (1–3). Pneumonia can have adverse consequences for both the mother and her fetus, with certain infections (particularly viral and fungal) assuming greater virulence and mortality than in non-pregnant women of similar age (2, 3). Pneumonia is a relatively common cause of respiratory failure in pregnant patients, but in contrast to older studies, newer data suggest that not all pneumonias are more common or more serious in pregnant women than in other populations. However, because pneumonia can impact both the mother and fetus, it may lead to an increased likelihood of complicated preterm delivery, compared to pregnancies in which infection is absent. The pathogens responsible for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are similar in pregnant and non-pregnant patients, with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella spp., Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and influenza A accounting for the majority of cases (2–4). However, reduction in cell-mediated immunity associated with pregnancy (especially during the third trimester) places women at an increased risk of more severe forms of pneumonia and disseminated diseases from pathogens normally contained by this type of immune response, including herpes virus, influenza, varicella, and coccidioidomycosis (3, 5–7).","Khan, Samar; Niederman, Michael S.",Pulmonary Problems in Pregnancy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120499/,394

The co-optation by anti-hegemonic Hongkongers of key cultural, economic, social, and political venues within the city during its many demonstrations, processions, rallies, and protests can be seen as visual resistance and as an effort to create a rich countervisuality by giving “voice to the visual.” Similarly, the conflation of special days (January 1st, May 4th, June 4th, July 1st, October 1st) with identifiable protests in Hong Kong—“Days of Contention”—suggest a similar impetus.","Garrett, Daniel",Counter-hegemonic Resistance in China's Hong Kong,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120968/,394

Although the great majority of cases are benign and self-limited, requiring no intervention, some patients need respiratory support. Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) is a critical intervention in many cases of acute respiratory failure (ARF), but there are absolute risks associated with endotracheal intubation (ETI). On the other hand, noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is an extremely valuable alternative to IMV. A major reason for the increasing use of NIV has been the desire to avoid the complications of IMV. It is generally much safer than IMV and has been shown to decrease resource utilization. Its use also avoids the complications and side effects associated with ETI, including upper airway trauma, laryngeal swelling, postextubation vocal cord dysfunction, nosocomial infections, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. There are a number of advantages of NIV including leaving the upper airway intact, preserving the natural defense mechanisms of the upper airways, decreasing the need for sedation, maintaining the ability to talk while undergoing NIV, and reducing the length of hospitalization and its associated costs [1–3].","Teksam, Ozlem; Bayrakci, Benan",Noninvasive Ventilation in High-Risk Infections and Mass Casualty Events,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121261/,394

The main indications in childhood are pulmonary hypertension in infancy and cystic fibrosis in children and adolescents. Contraindications are absolute and relative and often vary from one to another transplant program. Multi-organ disorders, active malignancy, and specific active infection are general agreed upon contraindications. Only 21% of organ donors had suitable lungs for transplant. Although immunosuppressive regimens vary, most lung transplant centers use induction to avoid early acute rejection. The postoperative period is not only crucial for early detection of complications, such as infections and rejection, but also in the long term when gastrointestinal and neurological complications may compromise up to 50% of the patients. One year survival rate is around 85%, and 3 year survival is around 65%. Long-term survival is determined primarily by the development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), so it is important to plan better therapeutic regimes to preserve graft function.","Patel, Anand; Faro, Albert",Pediatric Respiratory Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121766/,394

25539,Human Security: A South American Perspective,2009,"Intestinal transplantation (ITx) represents the physiologic alternative to total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for patients suffering from life-threatening complications of irreversible intestinal failure. The number of transplants performed worldwide has been increasing for several years until recently. ITx has recently become a valid therapeutic option with a graft survival rate between 80 % and 90 % at 1 year, in experienced centers. These results have been achieved due to a combination of several factors: better understanding of the pathophysiology of intestinal graft, improved immunosuppression techniques, more efficient strategies for the monitoring of the bowel graft, as well as control of infectious complications and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). In fact, this procedure is associated with a relatively high rate of complications, such as infections, acute rejection, graft versus host disease (GVHD), and PTLD, if compared to the transplantation of other organs. These complications may be, at least in part, the consequence of the peculiarity of this graft, which contains gut-associated lymphoid tissue and potentially pathogenic enteric flora. Furthermore, in these patients, the existing disease and the relative malnutrition could predispose them to infectious complications. Additionally, other factors associated with the procedure, such as laparotomy, preservation injury, abnormal motility, and lymphatic disruption, could all be implicated in the development of complications.","Tuveri, Massimiliano; Pisu, Salvatore; Cicalese, Luca",Living Donor Advocacy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122154/,394

In addition to the use of personal protection equipment (PPE), such measures include source isolation of infected patients. In the process of confining infectious pathogens, however, it is essential that health systems do not overlook the psychological needs of patients nor that of the medical staff who care for them. This chapter is divided into two sections. The first explores the experiences of patients cared for in source isolation, highlighting the possible iatrogenic psychological consequences of treatment in a biocontainment unit. Strategies for mitigating the potentially harmful psychological effects of isolation are reviewed, including considerations for children. The second section considers the experiences of healthcare workers. The discussion outlines the psychological impact of treating patients with infectious diseases, risk factors for emotional distress, and strategies to promote psychological well-being and resilience.","Cates, David S.; Gomes, Paula G.; Krasilovsky, Arthur M.",Bioemergency Planning,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123438/,394

The majority of these works rely on time-based sessions which are sequences of contiguous queries segmented using time threshold on users’ activities. However, queries are generally issued by users having in mind a particular task, and time-based sessions unfortunately fail in revealing such tasks. In this paper, we are interested in revealing in which extent time-based sessions vs. task-based sessions represent significantly different background contexts to be used in the perspective of better understanding users’ query reformulations. Using insights from large-scale search logs, our findings clearly show that task is an additional relevant search unit that helps better understanding user’s query reformulation patterns and predicting the next user’s query.

It describes the roles of intestinal enzymes, focussing on complementarity with salivary, gastric, and pancreatic digestive enzymes and their hydrolytic function in the process of absorption. Gene expression of the enzymes and nutritional regulation of their expression appear during postnatal development up to maturity. After translation of the specific mRNA, a single precursor of maltaseglucoamylase (pro-MG), rich in mannose, is produced in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). In contrast to the relatively small number of carbohydrases, the number of peptidases found in enterocytes in the small intestine is large, because of the large number of different peptide bonds in oligopeptides produced by the action of pancreatic proteases. The digestive function (disaccharidase and peptidase activities) of the enterocytes and their microvilli begins when structural differentiation is complete, that is, during the period of migration over the cryptvillus junction. Modern techniques and investigations are expected to yield relevant data for elaborating feeding strategies that take into account the complex interactions between the diet, the microflora, the luminal milieu and the physiology of the small intestine, including the optimal functioning of the immunological and endocrine systems.","Huërou-Luron, I.

We firstly use weighted matrix factorization (WMF) and convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn and extract the song feature vectors. In order to capture the changes of listeners’ preferences sensitively, we innovatively enhance simulating interaction process of listeners and update the model continuously based on their preferences both for songs and song transitions.

DESIGN: Comparative effectiveness cohort study based on a quality improvement project. SETTING: Five ICUs at a tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: A total of 541 mechanically ventilated patients over a 2-year period (2014–2015): 280 and 261, respectively. Age ranged from 19 to 94 years (mean, 63.84; sd, 14.96). INTERVENTIONS: A hospital-based initiative spurred development of a multidisciplinary team, tasked with establishing early mobilization in ICUs. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Early mobilization in the ICUs was evaluated by the number of physical therapy consults, length of stay, individual treatment sessions utilizing functional outcomes, and follow-up visits. Implementation of an early mobilization protocol across all ICUs led to a significant increase in the number of physical therapy consults, a significant decrease in ICU and overall lengths of stay, significantly shorter days to implement physical therapy, and a significantly higher physical therapy follow-up rate. CONCLUSIONS: Mobilizing individuals in an intensive care setting decreases length of stay and hospital costs. With an interdisciplinary team to plan, implement, and evaluate stages of the program, a successful early mobilization program can be implemented across all ICUs simultaneously and affect change in patients who will require prolonged mechanical ventilation.","Escalon, Miguel X.; Lichtenstein, Ann H.; Posner, Elliot; Spielman, Lisa; Delgado, Andrew; Kolakowsky-Hayner, Stephanie A.",Crit Care Explor,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314317/,394
35899,Introduction: The Paradoxes and Worries in Contemporary Times,2020-07-04,"In this paper, we discuss the mechanisation of some fundamental propositional modal model theory. The focus on models is novel: previous work in mechanisations of modal logic have centered on proof systems and applications in model-checking. We have mechanised a number of fundamental results from the first two chapters of a standard textbook (Blackburn et al. [1]). Among others, one important result, the Van Benthem characterisation theorem, characterises the connection between modal logic and first order logic. This latter captures the desired saturation property of ultraproduct models on countably incomplete ultrafilters.","Xu, Yiming; Norrish, Michael",Automated Reasoning,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7324286/,394

36539,A User-Centered Approach to Digital Household Risk Management,2020-05-30,"[Image: see text] Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) are active ingredients in over 200 disinfectants currently recommended by the U.S. EPA for use to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus. The amounts of these compounds used in household, workplace, and industry settings has very likely increased, and usage will continue to be elevated given the scope of the pandemic. QACs have been previously detected in wastewater, surface waters, and sediments, and effects on antibiotic resistance have been explored. Thus, it is important to assess potential environmental and engineering impacts of elevated QAC usage, which may include disruption of wastewater treatment unit operations, proliferation of antibiotic resistance, formation of nitrosamine disinfection byproducts, and impacts on biota in surface waters. The threat caused by COVID-19 is clear, and a reasonable response is elevated use of QACs to mitigate spread of infection. Exploration of potential effects, environmental fate, and technologies to minimize environmental releases of QACs, however, is warranted.","Hora, Priya I.; Pati, Sarah G.; McNamara, Patrick J.; Arnold, William A.",Environ Sci Technol Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7341688/,394
36540,Me Without My Smartphone? Never! Predictors of Willingness for Smartphone Separation and Nomophobia,2020-05-30,"Global scenario assessments in support of climate, biodiversity, energy and other international policy deliberations tend to focus on a narrow bandwidth of possibilities: futures that unfold gradually from current patterns and trends. This “continuity bias” downplays the real risks (and opportunities) of structural discontinuity in the evolution of the global social-ecological system. The inclination to focus on mathematically tractable representations and conventional futures preferred by decision-makers is understandable, but constrains the scientific imagination and the scope of policy guidance. Earlier studies spotlighted discontinuous global futures, thereby revealing a broader spectrum of possibilities and repertoire of actions than found in contemporary scenario analysis. The paper revisits three types of futures introduced 25 years ago; examines three truths they convey about the contemporary moment; and points to three courses of action they suggest. Contemporary assessments centre on incrementally changing Conventional Worlds, yet varieties of global disruption (Barbarization) and progressive transformation (Great Transition) remain plausible alternatives. Corresponding to this triad, three synergistic action prongs—reform (incremental policies), remediation (emergency preparedness and prevention), and redesign (deep cultural and institutional change)—come into focus. Recovering a comprehensive perspective on the global possible would reinvigorate debate on the kind of transformation needed, broaden the action agenda, and stimulate innovative research for illuminating our indeterminate future. The COVID-19 pandemic, a concrete illustration of historical discontinuity, underscores the critical importance of emphasizing nonconventional futures in policy assessments.","Raskin, Paul; Swart, Rob",Sustain Earth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7341699/,394
36611,Die Ausgangslage,2020-07-13,"BACKGROUND: Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor is the cornerstone for prevention ischemic events in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, the optimal antiplatelet strategy for ACS patients with both high bleeding and high ischemic risks is unclear. STUDY DESIGN: The Optimal antiPlatelet Therapy for patients with high Bleeding and Ischemic RISK (OPT-BIRISK) trial is a multicenter, double blinded, placebo controlled, randomized study designed to test the superiority of extended antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel monotherapy compared with aspirin and clopidogrel for reduction of bleeding events in ACS patients with both high bleeding and high ischemic risks (“bi-risk”). A total of 7700 patients who completed 9- to 12-month DAPT after new generation drug eluting stent implantation for the treatment of ACS will be randomized to receive clopidogrel monotherapy or aspirin plus clopidogrel for 9 months, followed by aspirin monotherapy for 3 months. The primary end point is Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 2, 3 or 5 bleedings at 9 months after randomization. The key secondary endpoint is major adverse cardiac and cerebral events at 9 months after randomization, defined as a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke or coronary artery revascularization. CONCLUSION: OPT-BIRISK is the first large scale, randomized trial aimed to explore the optimal antiplatelet strategy for bi-risk ACS patients after PCI in current clinical practice. The results will add evidence regarding de-escalation antiplatelet therapy for patients at special risk.","Li, Yi; Jing, Quanmin; wang, Bing; Wang, Xiaozeng; Li, Jing; Qiao, Shubing; Chen, Shaoliang; Angiolillo, Dominick J.; Han, Yaling",Am Heart J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7346838/,394
36721,The Gendered Religious Response to State Action on the Coronavirus Pandemic,2020-06-12,"Due to the recent pandemic of coronavirus, known as the COVID-19 outbreak, the supply chains have been impacted most significantly. Manufacturers of certain items have experienced a substantial increase in demand, and on the other hand, raw materials supply, to produce those items, has reduced because of supply failure. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes some strategies to improve service level during an extraordinary pandemic outbreak, such as COVID-19, for the most wanted products such as toilet paper. This study considers meeting the increased demand of the customers for an essential product of daily life like toilet paper during a pandemic is beyond the traditional economic objective, i.e., increase profit, of the manufacturers. Instead, this should be more about the social responsibility of all the manufactures to ensure that they can serve more customers. Motivated by this and taking toilet paper as an example of the product, we first analyzed the current scenario of the manufacturing and the demand for the product and then proposed some strategies to deal with this unprecedented risk and analyzed the results. We have compared the results, using hypothetical data, between the current scenario and proposed strategies. The result shows that sharing information and resources from all manufacturers to produce under a single brand, emergency sourcing, producing basic quality items, and packing in the smallest sizes have a significant positive impact on the service level. This paper first investigates the strategies for a high-demand and essential item during a pandemic situation and proposes strategies to deal with this unique, extraordinary disruption.","Paul, Sanjoy Kumar; Chowdhury, Priyabrata",Glob J Flex Syst Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7354369/,394

37476,Beyond Boomerang,2020-08-04,"BACKGROUND: The privately owned companion dog is an emerging model in comparative medicine, notably because it shares the human environment including its risk factors, is affected by many analogous age-related diseases, receives comparable medical care, and has excellent veterinary medical data available. Past studies of dog lifespan have used academic, corporate or insurance data. While independent primary care data exist for the UK, none have as of yet been published for the US. This study analyzed data from three independent primary care US veterinary hospitals and identified factors that influence lifespan and mortality in a cohort of n = 20,970 privately owned dogs using Kaplan-Meier survival estimators and Cox Proportional Hazards modelling, including body size as a covariate. RESULTS: As previously reported, body size was negatively correlated with lifespan. Gonadectomy was associated with a longer lifespan, with the effect being stronger in females than in males. This lifespan advantage was conserved in gonadectomized female dogs that lived to at least ages 5 and 8 years. We did not find significant differences in lifespan between purebred and mixed breed dogs; however, breeds with larger effective population sizes and/or lower inbreeding coefficients had median survival times 3–6 months longer than breeds with smaller effective population sizes or higher inbreeding coefficients, indicating that these measures of genetic diversity may be affecting breed lifespans. We also found that dog breeds belonging to the “Mountain” ancestral group had median survival times that were 3.5–4.6 years shorter than other purebred dog groups, which remained significant even when correcting for body size. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that it is possible to obtain and analyze data from independent veterinary clinics in the US, an approach that could be useful for studies of comparative epidemiology under the One Health and One Welfare paradigms. We also show that the lifespan effects of gonadectomy are not identical between the sexes and should be investigated separately by sex in future analyses. More research is needed to further clarify the influence of age at gonadectomy, as well as the factors leading to the observed differences in lifespan in the “Mountain” ancestral group and in dog breeds of varying inbreeding coefficients and effective population sizes.","Urfer, Silvan R.; Kaeberlein, Matt; Promislow, Daniel E.

Compared to global media companies such as Google and Facebook that aggregate data from various sources (and the privacy concerns these aggregations bring), local companies only capture a small number of (high-quality) traits and retrieve an unbalanced small amount of revenue. To increase these local publishers’ competitive advantage, they need to join forces, whilst taking the visitors’ privacy concerns into account. The EcoDaLo consortium, located in Belgium and consisting of Adlogix, Pebble Media, and Roularta Media Group as founding partners, aims to combine local publishers’ data without requiring these partners to share this data across the consortium. Usage of Semantic Web technologies enables a decentralized approach where federated querying allows local companies to combine their captured visitor traits, and better target visitors, without aggregating all data. To increase potential uptake, technical complexity to join this consortium is kept minimal, and established technology is used where possible. This solution was showcased in Belgium which provided the participating partners valuable insights and suggests future research challenges. Perspectives are to enlarge the consortium and provide measurable impact in ad targeting to local publishers.","Lieber, Sven; De Meester, Ben; Verborgh, Ruben; Dimou, Anastasia",Semantic Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7586443/,394

METHODS: A comparative facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from February 01 to May 30, 2019. A total of 434 HIV mono-infected and 143 TB/ HIV co-infected patients were randomly selected for the study. The data were collected using an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire. The health-related quality of life of patients was measured using the World Health Organization quality of life HIV instrument which contains physical, psychological, social relationships, environmental, level of independence, and spiritual domains. The validated version of the Kessler scale was used to assess depressive symptoms. Linear regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with the outcome variables, and a p-value < 0.05 with 95% CI was used to measure the degree of association between health-related quality of life and independent variables. RESULTS: The mean scores of health-related quality of life among HIV mono-infected patients in terms of thephysical, psychological, level of independence, social relationships, environmental, and spiritual health domains were 63.9, 65.0, 60.5, 59.0, 56.4, and 63.9, respectively; whereas the mean scores among TB/HIV co-infected patients were 46.6, 48.5, 42.7, 43.5, 39.3, and 51.3, respectively. Among HIV mono-infected patients, being married improved the quality of social relationships by 6.7 compared with unmarried patients (β = 6.7, 95% CI = 3.24, 10.11); whereas among the TB/HIV co-infected patients, being educated increased the quality of social relationships by 10.6 compared with being uneducated (β=10.6, 95% CI=3.70, 17.51). CONCLUSION: The study revealed that the TB/HIV co-infected patients had poor health-related quality of life in all domains compared with HIV mono-infected patients. Besides, depression and stigma were more prevalent among co-infected patients. Therefore, designing and implementing specific management that focuses on psychiatric centers for TB/HIV co-infected patients will be necessary as their quality of life is lowered.","Hailu, Tilahun; Yitayal, Mezgebu; Yazachew, Lake",Patient Prefer Adherence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7567992/,394

The review argues that factors at the international/treaty level and factors at the domestic state level increase the difficulty of implementing effective international treaties on human rights. At the international level, the treaties and organizations to which states belong suffer some weakness as discussed in international relations theories, while seven factors are particularly important for promoting effectiveness of international human rights treaties at the domestic level: political capacity, economic development, national human rights institutes, regional human rights courts, regional intergovernmental organizations, strength of civil society, and political stability. Although the number of international human rights agreements signed and ratified by Asia Pacific states is increasing following the trends of Western states, less research focuses on the implementation and effects of these institutions. Asia Pacific nations face vastly different conditions than Western nations, such as more complicated security environments, larger cultural and religious differences, and less development and democratic values in some cases. Due to these differences, it is important to consider other potential variables that influence efficacy of treaty instruments for non-Western nations. What are the differences between implementation of human rights treaties in Western and Asian nations? How do they affect the efficacy of international agreements on individual human rights?","Ahdanisa, Dissa Syakina; Rothman, Steven B.",SN Soc Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7680663/,394

44707,Air pollution distribution in Arak city considering the effects of neighboring pollutant industries and urban traffics,2021-01-20,"BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer is the ninth most common type of cancer worldwide. In the past, radical cystectomy via open surgery has been considered the gold-standard treatment for muscle invasive bladder cancer. However, in recent years there has been a progressive increase in the use of robot-assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy. The aim of the current project is to investigate the surgical, oncological, and functional outcomes of patients with bladder cancer who undergo radical cystectomy comparing three different surgical techniques (robotic-assisted, laparoscopic, and open surgery). Pre-, peri- and post-operative factors will be examined, and participants will be followed for a period of up to 24 months to identify risks of mortality, oncological outcomes, hospital readmission, sexual performance, and continence. METHODS: We describe a protocol for an observational, prospective, multicenter, cohort study to assess patients affected by bladder neoplasms undergoing radical cystectomy and urinary diversion. The Italian Radical Cystectomy Registry is an electronic registry to prospectively collect the data of patients undergoing radical cystectomy conducted with any technique (open, laparoscopic, robotic-assisted). Twenty-eight urology departments across Italy will provide data for the study, with the recruitment phase between 1st January 2017-31st October 2020. Information is collected from the patients at the moment of surgical intervention and during follow-up (3, 6, 12, and 24 months after radical cystectomy). Peri-operative variables include surgery time, type of urinary diversion, conversion to open surgery, bleeding, nerve sparing and lymphadenectomy. Follow-up data collection includes histological information (e.g., post-op staging, grading, and tumor histology), short- and long-term outcomes (e.g., mortality, post-op complications, hospital readmission, sexual potency, continence etc). DISCUSSION: The current protocol aims to contribute additional data to the field concerning the short- and long-term outcomes of three different radical cystectomy surgical techniques for patients with bladder cancer, including open, laparoscopic, and robot-assisted. This is a comparative-effectiveness trial that takes into account a complex range of factors and decision making by both physicians and patients that affect their choice of surgical technique.

46246,"Xian Huang, Social Protection under Authoritarianism: (New York: Oxford University Press, 2020), 280p, $74.00 hardback",2021-03-02,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has strained all medical systems, especially in countries like Ecuador, where health services were already limited. These conditions, combined with a deadly and unusual disease, like primary heart angiosarcoma, can lead to severe outcomes. Angiosarcomas represent the most common and aggressive primary malignant heart tumor; regretfully, its clinical manifestations are vague and can be easily missed. Most patients become symptomatic when there is local invasion, embolization, or metastases, leading to late diagnosis and poor survival. High clinical awareness, adequate diagnosis, and prompt treatment are vital in these rare diseases, in which time is of paramount importance. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 28-year-old female who had cough, hemoptysis, and ground-glass opacities in the CT (computed tomography). Since Ecuador is in the middle of this pandemic, she was misdiagnosed and mistreated. Primary heart angiosarcoma was diagnosed, and regretfully, the patient suffered multiple complications due to diagnosis and died. CONCLUSION: To this day, most cardiac angiosarcomas are found in a late-stage with distal metastasis and advanced local invasion. Sadly, this tumor is frequently missed due to its incidence and broad-spectrum of clinical symptoms. Considering that its manifestations can be misleading, misdiagnosis can occur, especially in pandemic times. Therefore, knowledge of other pathologies prevents COVID-19 from overshadowing other diagnoses, hence preventing delayed diagnosis or even misdiagnosis and consequent adverse outcomes for patients.

Investment-grade corporate bonds traded at a discount to credit default swaps; exchange-traded funds traded at a discount to net asset value, more so for safer bonds. The Federal Reserve’s announcement of corporate bond purchases caused these dislocations to disappear and prices to recover. These facts inform potential theories of the disruption. The best explanation is an acute liquidity need for specific bond investors, such as mutual funds, leading them to liquidate large positions.","Haddad, Valentin; Moreira, Alan; Muir, Tyler",Rev Financ Stud,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7928582/,394

Moreover, closing schools has extreme social, cultural, educational and economic implications on the student, teacher and parent populations. This is especially true for students from families of lower-socio-economic status and young students who need parental assistance. Furthermore, online learning is not suitable for all teachers, because some lack the technological capabilities needed. To examine the attitudes of teachers and students towards online learning, questionnaires were administered to 476 students, grades 3–7 and 250 teachers from the Arab and Jewish sectors. The findings revealed that age plays an important role both among teachers and students, where mainly younger children and older teachers encounter difficulties in this transformation. Furthermore, gender and sectoral differences were found both among teachers and students. These findings show that conversion to online learning may widen the existing gaps.","Masry-Herzallah, Asmahan; Stavissky, Yuliya",SN Soc Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7939725/,394

Depending on the value of the involved parameter, the corresponding Rényi distribution can take both an exponential form and a power-law form, which is typical for a wide range of statistical models. In this paper, we prove the energy equipartition theorem in the case of Rényi statistics, which makes it possible to solve the problem of obtaining the average energy for a large number of classical statistical models. The proposed approach for calculating the average energy is compared with the procedure for directly calculating this quantity for a system described by the simplest power-low Hamiltonian. New relations are presented that simplify the calculations in the considered theory. A special case of the Rényi distribution, which represents a generalization of a power-low distribution and thus allows us to approximate some empirical data more precisely, has been studied.","Bakiev, T.

This work employed the quantitative analysis of multi-components by a single marker (QAMS) method to quantitatively determine the six effective components of glycyrrhizic acid, liquiritin, isoliquiritin apioside, liquiritigenin, isoliquiritin, and glycyrrhetinic acid in Glycyrrhiza uralensis, which was used for comprehensive evaluation of the optimal extraction process by DESs. First, Choline Chloride: Lactic Acid (ChCl-LA, molar ratio 1:1) was selected as the most suitable DES by comparing the extraction yields of different DESs. Second, the extraction protocol was investigated by extraction time, extraction temperature, liquid-to-material ratio, molar ratio, and ultrasonic power. The Box–Behnken design (BBD) combined with response surface methodology (RSM) was used to investigate the optimal DES conditions. The result showed that the best DES system was 1.3-butanediol/choline chloride (ChCl) with the molar ratio of 4:1. The optimal extraction process of licorice was 20 mL/g, the water content was 30%, and the extraction time was 41 min. The comprehensive impact factor (z) was 0.92. At the same time, it was found that the microstructure of the residue extracted by the eutectic solvent was more severely damaged than the residue after the traditional solvent extraction through observation under an electron microscope. The DES has the characteristics of high efficiency and rapidity as an extraction solution.","Yu, Ping; Li, Qian; Feng, Yanmei; Ma, Sinan; Chen, Yuying; Li, Guichen",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7957616/,394

Body composition was assessed by bioimpedance. Change of direction and agility were evaluated by two padel-adapted tests. Upper-limb strength measurement included overhead and side medicine ball throws with dominant and non-dominant hands. One-way ANCOVA was used to determine whether there were significant differences between gender and experience on fitness variables adjusting for age as a covariate. Male and female young padel players presented an apparently healthy body composition and exhibited similar performance in all fitness tests except for jumping ability. Practice experience seemed to influence upper-limb throwing strength, however, sub-analyses revealed no conclusive results. These results contribute to the existing knowledge in padel by providing new data about the fitness status of amateur young players aged 13 to 17 years old and open a window for future interventions using padel as a health promotion tool among youths.","Courel-Ibáñez, Javier; Llorca-Miralles, Javier",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7967362/,394

The main goal is the semantic integration, enrichment and interlinking of data that are generated through the documentation process of artworks and cultural heritage objects. This is accomplished by using state-of-the-art technologies and current standards of the Semantic Web (RDF, OWL, SPARQL), as well as widely accepted models and vocabularies relevant to the cultural domain (Dublin Core, SKOS, Europeana Data Model). A set of specialized tools such as KARMA and OpenRefine/RDF-extension is being used and evaluated in order to achieve the semantic integration of museum data from heterogeneous sources. Interlinking is achieved using tools such as Silk and OpenRefine/RDF-extension, discovering links (at the back-end) between disparate datasets and other external data sources such as DBpedia and Wikidata that enrich the source data.

To do so, we exploit the representation of graphical objects by maximal primitives we have introduced in previous work. By calculating multi-scale and irregular isothetic representations of the contour, we obtained 1-D (one-dimensional) intervals, and achieved afterwards a decomposition into maximal line segments or circular arcs. By adapting minDSS to this sparse and irregular data of 1-D intervals supporting the maximal primitives, we are now able to reconstruct the input noisy objects into cyclic contours made of lines or arcs with a minimal number of primitives. We explain our novel complete pipeline in this work, and present its experimental evaluation by considering both synthetic and real image data.","Vacavant, Antoine; Kerautret, Bertrand; Feschet, Fabien",Geometry and Vision,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971808/,394

The checkers are often based on tests that can be made on the underlying website code to see whether it complies with the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). However, as the type of code needed for the development of sophisticated interactive web services and online applications becomes more complex, so the guidelines have had to be updated with the adoption of new success criteria or additional revisions to older criteria. In some instances, this has led to questions being raised about the reliability of the automatic accessibility checks and whether the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) could be helpful. This paper explores the need to find new ways of addressing the requirements embodied in the WCAG success criteria, so that those reviewing websites can feel reassured that their advice (regarding some of the ways to reduce barriers to access) is helpful and overcomes issues around false positive or negatives. The methods used include image recognition and natural language processing working alongside a visual appraisal system, built into a web accessibility checker and reviewing process that takes a functional approach.","Draffan, E.

In 2006, the European Parliament (EP) described, defined, and issued recommendations concerning the acquisition of key competences in individual subjects and general knowledge by young people completing their compulsory education. Among the four subject-defined competences are those pertaining to mathematics and basic scientific and technical skills, as well as IT competences. The need to acquire mathematical abilities concerns amassing the aptitude to develop and use mathematical thinking in solving problems arising from everyday situations, with an emphasis on process, action, and knowledge. However, for many persons who are either blind or vision-impaired, there remains considerable barriers to equal participation in disciplines which rely on mathematical content. This paper describes the EuroMath project which has, over the past three years, developed a web-based solution to enable mathematical communication between teachers and students. Note that we do not stipulate whether the student or teacher is the individual with the visual disability. Rather, we assume that said individual can fulfil either role. To this end, the EuroMath platform has been designed to enable the person who is blind or vision-impaired to create mathematical content or acquire it from others.","Fitzpatrick, Donal; Nazemi, Azadeh; Terlikowski, Grzegorz",Computers Helping People with Special Needs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972611/,394

A comparison has been made with the power sector restructuring program followed in the UK with specific reference to competition. Does the Indian restructuring program really usher in competition or is it merely unbundling into separate entities which makes no material difference in terms of efficiency and growth? The essay briefly describes how the power sector performed in India, post-restructuring and what has been the contribution of the regulatory bodies, if any. Have the regulatory bodies been proactive as in the case of UK or have they degenerated into passive organisations only doing the government’s bidding? The essay finally suggests a way forward on how to improve the functioning of the distribution sector and the recommendation that is being made is privatisation of the distribution companies. It is strongly felt that public-owned distribution companies can never deliver since there is a clear lack of accountability which gets further complicated on account of government interference.

This prompts the government to issue various fiscal and monetary measures to mitigate the impacts and sustain the livelihood of the people. Amid this pandemic, Cambodia strengthens relation with China both politically and economically. Cambodian Prime Minister, as the first foreign leader, made an official visit to China during the pandemic to express support for the country and opposed the banning of flights to and from China. China, in return, dispatched a team of medical experts and provided medical equipment to Cambodia for dealing with the pandemic. On the economic front, the two countries embark on an ambitious free trade agreement. The Cambodia-China Free Trade Agreement, which aims to increase annual bilateral trade between the two countries to US$ 10 billion, covers goods, investment, technical cooperation, e-commerce, and BRI cooperation. All of these showcases the intimate relation between Cambodia and China.

This is why America has been seeking for some time now to replace China as a supply chain hub with India and other minor Asian countries, in an effort to isolate Chinese high-tech companies from global production networks and joint ventures. Is war, then, between the USA and China looming large?","Fouskas, Vassilis K.; Roy-Mukherjee, Shampa; Huang, Qingan; Udeogu, Ejike",China & the USA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978802/,394
48914,IoT and Sensor Network,2020-07-23,"This chapter uses the framework of institutional change outlined in the previous chapter and applies it to a case study of US labor institutions. Firstly, it surveys US labor institutions in their formal, informal, and avoidable iterations. In terms of formal institutions, the traditional orientation of the USA was softened in the 1930s through the labor components of the New Deal although many of these rights have been reduced in subsequent decades. In terms of informal institutions, the collective bargaining structure is decentralized and both bargaining coverage and union density, never high to begin with, are consistently dropping. In terms of avoidable institutions, it seems that many employers are able to habitually ignore even the modest regulation in place. Also, a potential result is a very high-income inequality, with no strong union presence to cause similar wages. Secondly, this chapter examines the possible drivers of change. Institutional change in the case of the US labor institutions 1980–2019 seems to point to a continued deregulation of an already relatively deregulated system. This chapter argues for the role that the systemic cycle and the extensive developmental strategy played in causing this type of stable change alongside path dependence.","Lučev, Josip",Systemic Cycle and Institutional Change,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978808/,394
49011,Avoiding Unacceptable Risks,2020-08-05,"In this paper, we describe and evaluate how the learning framework ContextBased MicroTraining (CBMT) can be used to assist users to create strong passwords. Rather than a technical enforcing measure, CBMT is a framework that provides information security training to users when they are in a situation where the training is directly relevant. The study is carried out in two steps. First, a survey is used to measure how well users understand password guidelines that are presented in different ways. The second part measures how using CBMT to present password guidelines affect the strength of the passwords created. This experiment was carried out by implementing CBMT at the account registration page of a local internet service provider and observing the results on user-created passwords. The results of the study show that users presented with passwords creation guidelines using a CBMT learning module do understand the password creation guidelines to a higher degree than other users. Further, the experiment shows that users presented with password guidelines in the form of a CBMT learning module do create passwords that are longer and more secure than other users. The assessment of password security was performed using the zxcvbn tool, developed by Dropbox, that measures password entropy.","Kävrestad, Joakim; Nohlberg, Marcus",ICT Systems Security and Privacy Protection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978910/,394

In China, improvements in the health status of the population have powered the economic growth experienced by the country following the launch of the open door policy. Conversely, the emergence of a Chinese middle class and the improvement of economic conditions for a substantial proportion of the population have led to an increased demand for healthcare and to an improvement in people’s health. However, these improvements have not been homogeneous across the country, which still shows large inequalities between rural and urban areas and among provinces and where the “acceptable” level of health varies. The health industry, comprising healthcare providers, financiers and producers, plays a pivotal role, also in the light of the new technologies and of the availability of Big Data, whose handling can allow to design increasingly personalized treatments. The Chinese health industry has been showing steady signs of improvements, but there still are margins for improvement, especially in the light of recent spread of Covid-19, with externalities overcoming the national boundaries.","Di Tommaso, Marco R.; Spigarelli, Francesca; Barbieri, Elisa; Rubini, Lauretta",The Globalization of China&#x02019;s Health Industry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979079/,394

Inflammaging has been defined to explain a protective inflammatory response in the elderly. New subpopulations of stem cell memory T cells seem to be responsible for a quick memory response to antigens and probably against tumours. Biological immune therapy with anti-checkpoint inhibitors could be an essential tool to treat patients; however, adverse or toxic events are often observed in elderly patients. Several medications used in the elderly, metformin and valproic acid, have been shown to have anti-neoplastic effects. These effects suggest that therapeutic approaches in the elderly should be carefully analysed.

These include DC parameters such as voltage, current and resistance; low frequency and high frequency impedance related quantities such as capacitance, inductance and AC resistance; AC/DC high voltage and AC high current; AC power and energy; and quantum standard which includes quantum hall resistance (QHR), quantum current (QC) and quantum nanophotonics (QN). The metrological traceability of the electrical and electronics parameters to SI units is derived from Josephson Voltage Standard (JVS), Quantum Hall Resistance (QHR) standard and frequency (time) standards; all of them are being maintained at CSIR-NPL with metrological precision at par with international standards. The traceability of the aforementioned parameters is disseminated through an unbroken chain of apex level calibrations and testing at par with international level to the industries and strategic sectors of the country to improve the quality of life, which in turn will lead to the inclusive growth of the country and economic development. R&D efforts on the development of quantum standards is a constant endeavour and continues to be at the forefront. Specifically, CSIR-NPL focuses on the development of quantum standards related to the unit of current (ampere), the unit of resistance (ohm) and quantum nanophotonics which aims for detection of few photons (or even single photons) using the novel concept of superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPD). Among these the research on QC needs special mention, as this will lead to realisation of the SI unit of electric current (ampere), the only unit out of the seven base units of SI system. The quantum current standard (QCS) realisation is bifurcated into two approaches, (i) based on the single electron tunnelling effect (SET) observable in semiconductor quantum dot (QD) structures and (ii) the quantum phase slip phenomenon (QPS) observable in superconducting nanowires of cross-sectional area of the order of coherence length of the system. The realisation of the resistance unit (ohm) is based on the quantum hall effect observable in semiconductor 2DEG structures such as GaAs/AlGaAs systems. Recently there has been tremendous evidence emerging for the use of monolayer graphene for the use of QHR metrology. CSIR-NPL also started the growth of “epitaxial graphene anchored on SiC” and have obtained encouraging results. The nano-photonics measurement research is also taken up actively for its applications to realize quantum standards for optical radiation and device fabrication.","Somkuwar, Atul S.; Satish; Siwach, Praveen K.; Kumar, Ajeet; Shukla, Ajay K.; Kushvaha, Sunil S.; Rakshit, Rajib K.; Jain, Priyanka; Meena, R.

The underlying main problem is called Virus detection and consists in answering the following question: Is there a program that can always decide if a program is a virus or not? On the other hand, the undecidability of some problems is an important notion in Computer Science: an undecidable problem is a problem for which no algorithm exists to solve it. We propose an activity that demonstrates that virus detection is an undecidable problem. Hence we prove that the answer to the above question is no. We follow the proof given by Cohen in his PhD in 1983. The proof is close to the proof given by Turing in 1936 of the undecidability of the Halting problem. We also give an activity to prove the undecidability of the Halting problem. These proofs allow us to introduce two important ways of proving theorems in Computer Science: proof by contradiction and proof by case disjunction. We propose a simple way to present these notions to students using a maze. Our activity is unplugged, i.e. we use only a paper based model of computer, and is designed for high-school students. This is the reason why we use Scratch to write our “programs”.","Journault, Matthieu; Lafourcade, Pascal; More, Malika; Poulain, Rémy; Robert, Léo",Information Security Education,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980907/,394

The changing nature of warfare in the 21st century presented further challenges to this traditional rule. Nevertheless, courts across democratic jurisdictions have thus far refrained from defining an overall alternative rule. Rather, they have resorted to solving specific cases through narrowly tailored decisions. After surveying the developing jurisprudence in regard to access of enemy aliens to courts, this chapter suggests an alternative rule compliant with contemporary human rights law and relevant to 21st war realities. It goes on to consider why courts are hesitant to declare the traditional law void and what can be learned from this hesitance as to the interaction between war and legal institutions.","Peled, Roy; Orgad, Liav; Rabin, Yoram",Constitutionalism Under Extreme Conditions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981433/,394

From the 1980’s to the initial years of this century, there has been a renewed interest in methodological pragmatism and pluralism, particularly since 2006. Second, there is a thematic view, which is focused on the central tenets of pragmatism and pluralism to outline their consequences for scientific research as alternative to the influential conceptions mentioned.

51466,The Odd Weibull Inverse Topp–Leone Distribution with Applications to COVID-19 Data,2021-04-12,"This paper aims to analyze the adequacy of social support practices in the non-profit sector by users and representatives which are part of “Conselho Local de Ação Social (CLAS)” a non-profit organization located in the north of Portugal and focused on the prevention of social exclusion and poverty. A mixed methodological approach was used. A questionnaire was applied to social beneficiaries. To complement the results, interviews with the entities that constitute the executive board of CLAS were conducted. It was possible to perceive the discrepancies on the social support provided and measure the assessment given by the entity responsible for the social network. Consequently, we could conclude that the beneficiaries of the social response under research perceive a low level of social support received, as opposed to the institutions that perceive a high level of social support provided. This difference in support perception is reflected in all the dimensions analyzed. This research supports executors and decision makers responsible for the implementation of local social support policies on the alignment of beneficiaries’ expectations as well as contribute on the operation improvement of social networks. As for contributions to the practice, some practical suggestions are advised to social network operators, such as the need for more active listening with feedback for beneficiaries, as well as a set of other measures to be implemented regularly in the medium and long term. Regarding contribution to the theory, it is important to mention that the present research is innovative and original as it contributes to clarify and expand the existing literature on social networks in the tertiary sector, based on the analysis of 5 different dimensions of social support. Furthermore, the authors intend to support the welfare of users of the social network under research by increasing the performance of the social network under analysis.","Oliveira, Márcio; Oliveira, José; Borges, Ana Pinto; Lopes, João M.",Int Rev Public Nonprofit Mark,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8021478/,394

Indoor CO(2) measurements by low-cost sensors hold promise for mass monitoring of indoor aerosol transmission risk for COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases. We derive analytical expressions of CO(2)-based risk proxies and apply them to various typical indoor environments. The relative infection risk in a given environment scales with excess CO(2) level, and thus, keeping CO(2) as low as feasible in a space allows optimization of the protection provided by ventilation. We show that the CO(2) level corresponding to a given absolute infection risk varies by >2 orders of magnitude for different environments and activities. Although large uncertainties, mainly from virus exhalation rates, are still associated with infection risk estimates, our study provides more specific and practical recommendations for low-cost CO(2)-based indoor infection risk monitoring.","Peng, Zhe; Jimenez, Jose L.",Environ Sci Technol Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8043197/,394
51711,"Book Review: Judgment, Decision-Making, and Embodied Choices",2021-04-06,"BACKGROUND: COVID 19 is the most recent cause of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can support gas exchange in patients failing conventional mechanical ventilation, but its role is still controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on ECMO for COVID-associated ARDS to study its outcome. MAIN BODY: CENTRAL, MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus were systematically searched from inception to May 28, 2020. Studies reporting five or more patients with COVID-19 infection treated venovenous with ECMO were included. The main outcome assessed was mortality and ICU/hospital discharge. Baseline, procedural, outcome, and validity data were systematically appraised and pooled with random-effect methods. The validity of all the included observational studies was appraised with the Newcastle Ottawa scale. Meta-regression and publication bias were tested. This trial was registered with PROSPERO under registration number CRD42020183861. From 1647 initial citations, 34 full-text articles were analyzed and 12 studies were selected, including 194 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection requiring ICU admission and venovenous ECMO treatment. Median Newcastle-Ottawa scale was 6 indicating acceptable study validity. One hundred thirty-six patients reached an endpoint of weaning from ECMO with ICU/hospital discharge or death while the rest were still on ECMO or in the ICU. The median Berlin score for ARDS prior to starting ECMO was III. Patients received mechanical ventilation before ECMO implementation for a median of 4 days and ECMO was maintained for a median of 13 days. In hospital and short-term mortality were highly variable among the included studies ranging between 0 and 100%. Random-effect pooled estimates suggested an overall in-hospital mortality risk ratio of 0.49 (95% confidence interval 0.259 to 0.721; I(2) = 94%). Subgroup analysis according to country of origin showed persistent heterogeneity only in the 7 Chinese studies with pooled estimate mortality risk ratio of 0.66 (I(2) = 87%) (95% CI = 0.39-0.93), while the later larger studies coming from the USA showed pooled estimate mortality risk ratio of 0.41 (95% CI 0.28-0.53) with homogeneity (p=0.67) similar to France with a pooled mortality risk ratio of 0.26 (95% CI 0.08-0.43) with homogeneity (p=0.86). Meta-regression showed only younger age as a predictor of mortality (p=0.02). Publication bias was excluded by visualizing the funnel plot of standard error, Egger’s test with p=0.566, and Begg and Mazumdar test with p=0.373. CONCLUSION: The study included the largest number of patients with outcome findings of ECMO in this current pandemic. Our findings showed that the use of venovenous ECMO at high-volume ECMO centers may be beneficial for selected COVID 19 patients with severe ARDS. However, none of the included studies involve prospective randomized analyses; and therefore, all the included studies were of low or moderate quality according to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. In the current era and environment of the pandemic, it will likely be very challenging to conduct a prospective randomized trial of ECMO versus no-ECMO for COVID-19. Therefore, the information contained in this systematic review of the literature is valuable and provides important guidance.

However, little is known about whether experiences of psychological costs among benefit recipients can be relieved by reducing compliance demands in interactions with the state. Across three studies, we provide evidence that reducing demands causes relief. In a survey experiment, we show that psychological costs experienced by Danish unemployment insurance recipients change in response to information about actual reduced compliance demands. In two field studies, we exploit survey data collected around a sudden, exogenous shock (the COVID-19 lockdown of Danish society in March 2020), which led to immediate reductions in compliance demands in Denmark’s active labor market policies. We test whether two groups of benefit recipients experienced reduced psychological costs in response to these sudden reductions in compliance demands imposed by the state. Across all studies, we find that the reduction of compliance demands is associated with an increased sense of autonomy, and in two of the three studies it is associated with reduced stress. Overall, our findings suggest that psychological costs experienced by benefit recipients are indeed affected by state actions in the form of compliance demands.","Baekgaard, Martin; Sass Mikkelsen, Kim; Krogh Madsen, Jonas; Christensen, Julian",J Public Adm Res Theory,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8083216/,394

This study assesses the unidimensional structure and convergent validity of the Post-deployment Altruistic Identity Disruption Questionnaire (PostAID/Q), an 18-item questionnaire underpinned by the construct Altruistic Identity/Disruption (AI/AID). METHOD: Humanitarian aid personnel (N=108) completed an online web survey, inclusive of the Moral Injury Questionnaire (MIQ), Posttraumatic Distress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5), Psychological Well-Being Posttraumatic Changes Questionnaire (PWB-PTCQ) and Social Provisions Scale (SPS). RESULTS: A confirmatory factor analysis suggested a single factor structure providing further support for the conception of AI/AID as a unidimensional construct. Convergent validity was demonstrated through (1) utility for predicting a posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis assessed by the PCL-5, and (2) moral injury assessed by the MIQ. The PostAID/Q was further moderately and negatively associated with the availability of social support (assessed by the SPS) and lower self-reports of psychological well-being post trauma (assessed by the PWB-PCTQ). Finally, the PostAID/Q demonstrated evidence of incremental validity in predicting humanitarian specific psychological distress over and above the PCL-5. Specifically, the PostAID/Q predicted increased moral injury on the MIQ, and decreased psychological well-being post trauma. CONCLUSIONS: The PostAID/Q can assist in identifying humanitarian specific psychological responses post deployment guiding support for personnel, over and above more traditional measures of posttraumatic stress.","McCormack, Lynne; Douglas, Heather; Joseph, Stephen",Int J Humanitarian Action,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8089130/,394

Although COVID-19 has been studied as a lung pathogen, endocrine system involvement has rarely been studied. In this case report, we present a case of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and acute pancreatitis in the setting of COVID-19. Case Description: A 52-year-old female with a PMH of type 1 diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism, presented to the ED with nausea, vomiting, fatigue and diffuse abdominal pain. She reports cosmetic surgery a few weeks prior and she started feeling these symptoms at the beginning of admission day of admission. On admission, WBC was 34.9, blood glucose was 496, lactic acid of 3.1. Arterial blood gas revealed pH of 6.96, PCO2 of 17 mEq/L, PO2 of 143, HCO3 of 5 and anion gap of 23. DKA protocol was initiated and was upgraded to ICU. She was found to be RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. She denied other symptoms, including melena, jaundice, hematochezia, hematemesis, cough, SOB or diarrhea. She also denied use of alcohol, tobacco or illicit drugs, prior hospitalizations, or family history of pancreatitis. The physical exam was significant for tenderness to palpation in epigastric region without guarding or rebound. Laboratory studies revealed lipase: > 4000U/L, AST: 64 U/L, ALT: 57 U/L, ALKPHOS: 152 U/L, and total bilirubin: 1.1 mg/dL. Serum triglycerides and calcium levels were within normal limits. CT abdomen showed a severe peripancreatic inflammation and edema, moderate non-organized fluid surrounds pancreas. An abdominal ultrasound showed no calcified gallstone or gallbladder wall thickening. The common bile duct was 3 mm, normal size. Over the course of 24 hours, anion gap was 7, pH was 7.28, blood glucose was 158. For sepsis, lactic acid was 0.7 after initiation of azithromycin. For acute pancreatitis, she was treated conservatively with intravenous fluids, bowel rest and analgesia. Patient denied any upper respiratory symptoms and did not require oxygen so steroids were not started for COVID PNA. Her symptoms improved and she was discharged home. Discussion: Here we report a case of a patient who presented with DKA, found to have severe acute pancreatitis as well as SARS-CoV2 PCR positive. Few case reports have reported an association of DKA and acute pancreatitis. Although the exact mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 is evolving, it is thought to be mediated by the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2 which is present in intestine, and on islet cells of the pancreas. This injury may be due to cytopathic effect of viral replication or indirectly caused by the inflammatory response induced by the virus. Further studies are needed to better understand the pathophysiology behind AP in the setting of COVID-19.

52509,"Innovative, sustainable, and circular agricultural systems for the future",2021-05-06,"Introduction: The coronavirus disease global pandemic led to national lockdown in the United Kingdom on 23(rd) March 2020. We compared the glycaemic control of children and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) at Doncaster & Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals in the 12 weeks prior to the lockdown, to the 12 weeks following lockdown. Methods: HbA1c result 3 months following lockdown was compared to the last HbA1C prior to lockdown. Data from Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs), Flash Glucose Systems (FGS) and those performing Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose (SMBG) were compared alongside changes to patient contact that occurred. Results: In 264 patients under 20 years of age across both hospitals in the Trust, face-to-face consultations decreased (245 vs 151, 39%), and remote consultations increased (1751 vs 2269, 30%) (χ (2) p<0.001). Excluding those within a year of diagnosis, 122 had paired HbA1c results, and 80 had more than 70% of glucose monitoring data available. HbA1c levels decreased (67.4 mmol/mol vs 61.3 mmol/mol, p<0.001) and glucose monitoring data showed lower mean glucose after lockdown (9.7mmol/L vs 9.5mmol/L, p=0.034) with lower standard deviation (4.4mmol/L vs 4.2mmol/L, p<0.001). Proportion of time in range (3.9mmol/L to 10mmol/L) increased (n=47, 55.2% vs 58.0%, p=0.017), with no change to time below range (4.8% vs 5.0%, p=0.495). Conclusion: Glycaemic control improved in the 12 weeks following national lockdown. This demonstrates the difficulties faced by patients and carers managing T1DM around school pressures, meals away from home, social life and peer pressure. Increased remote contact with patients with T1DM has not been detrimental to glycaemic control.","Lawrence, Neil Richard; Natarajan, Anuja; Petkar, Razia; Joseph, Lovlin",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8089672/,394
52546,Planetary Confinement: Bio-Politics and Mutual Aid,2021-05-07,"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced countless challenges to the medical field and has brought increased attention to pediatric patients with pre-existing diagnoses such as diabetes. While pediatric patients have lower rates of COVID-19 mortality, the presence of pre-existing conditions can heighten the severity of their clinical presentation. Here we discuss how COVID-19 may contribute to the pathophysiology of DKA. Case Presentation: Our patient is a 6-year old female with known type 1 diabetes for 6 months, with positive GAD 0.25 nmol/L, c-peptide 0.3 ng/ml, blood glucose 555 mg/dl, HbA1c 10.9, beta hydroxybutyrate (βOHB) 3.21mmol/l, pH 7.35, HCO3 21 mEq/L at her initial presentation, and insulin requirement <0.5 IU/kg/day (in honeymoon). She presented to an outside hospital due to acute onset of abnormal breathing and altered mental status. The day prior, she had one episode of emesis, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, but no fever. She was reported to be agonal breathing with a GCS of 8 and unresponsive to physical or verbal stimuli. She was intubated shortly after arrival and given mannitol. Initial labs included a glucose 486 mg/dL, pH 6.88, bicarbonate 4 mEq/L, lactate 5.8 mmol/L, βOHB 11.9 mmol/L, and anion gap 29 mEq/L, all consistent with severe DKA. With a known family member with COVID-19, she was tested and found to be COVID-19 positive. She was transferred via flight to a higher level of care. Remarkably, she was appropriate for extubation the following day with return to her baseline mental status with improved acidosis. On day three of hospitalization, she developed further COVID-19 symptoms which included sore throat, productive cough, fatigue, headache, and high fever. These symptoms persisted four more days until she was afebrile and discharged home in good condition. Conclusion: Our patient’s rapid progression and severity of illness, including the need for intubation, requires the discussion of how COVID-19 might affect diabetes and suggests opportunities for improvement in clinical practice in children with preexisting diabetes. 1) COVID-19 might change the underlying pathophysiology and cause severe metabolic complications. Possible mechanisms might include a) binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, which are expressed in key metabolic organs and tissues, including pancreatic beta cells, leading to insulin resistance and islet cell destruction b) enabling a proinflammatory “cytokine storm” in the setting of higher basal proinflammatory state from diabetes. Additionally, ketoacidosis and altered mental status have been discovered in patients with COVID-19 without diabetes, which could potentiate the symptoms of DKA. 2) Prompt recognition and treatment of DKA is warranted as caregivers may attribute the symptoms to COVID-19 rather than DKA and recognition could be too late if symptoms are as acute as described in this case report.","Modarelli, Rachel; Hendrix, Grace; DeRusso, Michelle; Ozment, Caroline; Balikcioglu, Pinar Gumus",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8090091/,394

52821,Special issue on digital inclusion,2021-05-12,"BACKGROUND: Opioids are widely used in moderate-to-severe chronic pain which is non-responsive to standard analgesics. Prescriptions have increased in Europe in the last decade, although remain lower than in USA. This work projected the future utilization and costs of opioids in chronic osteoarthritis (OA) pain in the Spanish National Health System (NHS). METHODS: An epidemiological model was populated with the opioid dispensing trends from 2010 to 2019 using Spanish Medicinal Agency rates of opioid utilization in subjects over 18 years of age and the real-world OPIOIDS study to estimate chronic-OA-pain patients receiving opioids. A best-fitted trend analysis model was applied estimating the likely number of DHD (defined daily dose/1000 inhabitants per day) to calculate projected opioid utilization and costs for the period 2020–2029. RESULTS: In 2010, an estimated 5.67 DHD were dispensed for the equivalent of 217,076 chronic OA pain patients per day [1.99 DHD, 76,084 refractory to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)]. From these trends and OA prevalence, the projected number of DHDs is expected to increase more than threefold to 17.98 DHDs by the year 2029 for the equivalent of 727,356 chronic OA pain patients per day (8.18 DHD, 330,720 refractory to NSAIDs); 41.8% on strong opioids. The estimated cost was €116.9m (€45.0m in NSAID-refractory OA) in 2010 rising by 222% to €376.1m (€199.7m refractory to NSAIDs) by 2029. CONCLUSION: Chronic-OA-pain-related opioid dispensing and costs to the NHS are set to increase more than threefold from 2010 to 2029 in Spain. Using opioids for OA pain is concerning given disease chronicity and other related costs not computed in these projections. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: • Opioids are widely used in chronic pain which is non-responsive to standard analgesics. Prescriptions have increased in Europe, although remain lower than in USA. Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease usually accompanied by pain. Despite not recommended, opioids use in OA have been expanded because this health condition is increasing with ageing and, also, because physicians both primary and specialist boosted their use. • This study aimed to quantify the current burden of opioids used for chronic moderate-to-severe OA pain by estimating the number of defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants per day (DHD) and associated costs, and to forecast the likely burden on the National Health System (NHS) in Spain for the years 2020–2029. • In 2010, an estimated 5.67 DHDs were dispensed for the equivalent of 217,076 chronic OA pain patients per day. From these trends, the projected number of DHDs is expected to increase more than threefold to 17.98 DHDs by the year 2029 for the equivalent of 727,356 chronic OA pain patients per day; 41.8% on strong opioids. The estimated cost was €116.9m in 2010 rising by 222% to €376.1m by 2029. • Chronic OA-pain-related opioid dispensing and costs to the NHS are set to increase substantially (threefold to more than fourfold) from 2010 to 2029 in Spain. Thus, using opioids for OA pain is concerning given disease chronicity, aging population and other related costs not computed in these projections. Our findings can inform payors and clinicians about ongoing discussions on appropriate analgesic management for longer-term OA pain, including resource requirements at a national level. Clinicians who prescribe opioids for OA pain should consider the potential implications of side effects such as sedation, cognitive deterioration, incremental need of caregivers, particularly in older people, and carefully consider the risk–benefit balance.","Rejas-Gutierrez, Javier; Sicras-Mainar, Antoni; Darbà, Josep",Ther Adv Musculoskelet Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8107672/,394

54843,Is the ESG portfolio less turbulent than a market benchmark portfolio?,2021-06-25,"In the current urban system, characterised by a one-directional flow of resources from the rural environment to the cities, the construction sector plays a critical role in supporting the transition from a linear to a circular economy. In this framework, temporary pop-up environments act as an innovative and sustainable type of living system. These are structures conceived as temporary from the outset, based on characteristics like flexible light-weight technologies, fast and easy assembly operations, temporary occupation of the ground and adaptability to different uses, needs and target groups. Great importance is placed on construction reversibility and environmental sustainability. In the framework of the interdisciplinary research project ‘Urban Pop-Up Housing Environments and Their Potential as Local Innovation Systems’, six scenarios of application for temporary pop-up environments for the city of Vienna have been developed, taking into consideration technical, urban and social aspects, on the basis of local uses and climatic conditions. In order to explore drivers and barriers of the scenarios regarding the transferability of the concepts, online questionnaire sessions were conducted with an international audience. The feedback obtained by the participants allowed an analysis of the applicability of the concepts to other urban environments under comparable conditions at the international level. The paper presents the results obtained from the questionnaire sessions, allowing insight on the international perception of temporary pop-up environments and, specifically, strengths and weaknesses of the scenarios, as well as their possible applicability in the local contexts of the respondents. It was observed that while the perceptions of what requirements temporary housing must fulfil in order to be sustainable are quite uniform among the experts, the identified barriers for implementation within the different international contexts differed greatly. The designs of these temporary housing scenarios, which rely heavily on local resources and systems, are strongly interwoven with the fabric and conditions of the city they were conceptualised for. While this serves to promote the sustainability of these solutions, it poses a particular challenge for the international transferability, requiring heavy adaptation for other contexts.","Bertino, Gaetano; Rose, Gloria; Kisser, Johannes",Circ.Econ.Sust.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8215625/,394

Nsp1 is a 180 amino acid long protein with a primarily flexible structure that allows nsp1 to interact with various cellular factors during host shutoff to inhibit translation and promote mRNA decay. HYPOTHESIS/GOAL OF STUDY: Mutations of the surface residues of nsp1 either attenuate or augment its host shutoff function prompting the hypothesis that these residues bind cellular proteins that facilitate nsp1 during the host shutoff. To identify cellular proteins that interact with nsp1 and assist its function, we isolated host proteins proximal to nsp1 in human epithelial kidney cells by using a fusion protein, nsp1‐BioID2. These isolated proteins are identified using mass spectroscopy and verified by western blot. Also, we are using computer‐based modeling to predict the binding sites of these nsp1‐interacting proteins. METHODS AND RESULTS: By comparing protein complexes, we identified a large group of proteins including ribosomal proteins that are likely involved in host shutoff. In addition to the ribosomal proteins, factors implicated in the stress granule formation and RNA processing are identified and verified. We have tested these interactions in multiple mutants that are known to affect the host shutoff activity of nsp1. Surprisingly, none of the mutations in the structured region of nsp1 disrupts any of these mutations. CONCLUSIONS: BioID‐mediated tagging of the host proteins proximal to nsp1 allows us to identify multiple pathways modulated by nsp1.","Gerassimovich, Yevgeniy; Nag, Anita",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239845/,394

Each government has had to balance the dichotomy between freedom of expression and people’s right to be safe from the adverse impact of inaccurate information. Governments across the world have implemented a number of strategies to manage COVID-19 including issuing public advisories, advertising campaigns, holding press conferences and instituting punitive regulations to combat the distribution of false and misleading information. We examine the two most populous countries’ governments’ response to the scourge of fake news during COVID-19. China and India are the most challenging nations to govern in terms of their sheer size and diversity of their population. Each country’s government has taken several steps to minimise the impact of fake news during COVID, within its own political system.","Rodrigues, Usha M; Xu, Jian",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8263376/,394

Donald Trump’s election and his efforts to undermine the US “one-China policy” made things worse. While Taipei felt encouraged to challenge Beijing’s red line, Beijing believed it was necessary to exert even more pressure on Taipei. With greater capabilities and under increasing popular pressure, Beijing has taken a more proactive approach to address the perceived challenge of Taiwan independence. The process of vicious interactions between Taipei, Beijing, and Washington resembles the forming of a perfect storm. This paper reviews how this three-way interaction evolved over time, identifies the major factors shaping this situation, and speculates on future developments by analyzing the major factors involved. It argues that while a perfect storm is indeed taking shape, it is still possible to avert it. For this to happen, however, the three sides need to take a rational and pragmatic approach to managing their demands and desires.","Jia, Qingguo",China Int Strategy Rev.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8276688/,394

It has posed a great threat to public health of all age groups. The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiological trends and hotspots of OID in mainland China. Materials and Methods: Incidence and mortality data for OID stratified by date, age and region from 2004 to 2017 was extracted from the data-center of China public health science. Joinpoint regression and space-time analyses were performed to explore the epidemiological trends and hotspots of OID. Results: The average annual incidence of OID was 60.64/100,000 and it showed an increased trend in the mainland China especially after 2006 (APC = 4.12, 95 CI%: 2.06–6.21). Children of 0–4 year age group accounts for 60.00% (5,820,897/11,414,247) of all cases and its incidence continuously increased though 2004–2017 (APC = 6.65, 95 CI%: 4.39–8.96).

56922,Theft in Broad Daylight: Racism and Neoliberal Legality,2021-08-20,"Attitudes towards robots are not always unequivocally positive or negative: when attitudes encompass both strong positive and strong negative evaluations about an attitude object, people experience an unpleasant state of evaluative conflict, called ambivalence. To shed light on ambivalence towards robots, we conducted a mixed-methods experiment with N = 163 German university students that investigated the influence of robot autonomy on robot-related attitudes. With technological progress, robots become increasingly autonomous. We hypothesized that high levels of robot autonomy would increase both positive and negative robot-related evaluations, resulting in more attitudinal ambivalence. We experimentally manipulated robot autonomy through text vignettes and assessed objective ambivalence (i.e., the amount of reported conflicting thoughts and feelings) and subjective ambivalence (i.e., self-reported experienced conflict) towards the robot ‘VIVA’ using qualitative and quantitative measures. Autonomy did not impact objective ambivalence. However, subjective ambivalence was higher towards the robot high versus low in autonomy. Interestingly, this effect turned non-significant when controlling for individual differences in technology commitment. Qualitative results were categorized by two independent raters into assets (e.g., assistance, companionship) and risks (e.g., privacy/data security, social isolation). Taken together, the present research demonstrated that attitudes towards robots are indeed ambivalent and that this ambivalence might influence behavioral intentions towards robots. Moreover, the findings highlight the important role of technology commitment. Finally, qualitative results shed light on potential users’ concerns and aspirations. This way, these data provide useful insights into factors that facilitate human–robot research.","Stapels, Julia G.; Eyssel, Friederike",Int J Soc Robot,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8362653/,394

A total of 5104 CAD patients with an average follow-up of three years were enrolled into our study. Multivariate Cox regression was used to evaluate the associations between FT3, FT4 (free thyroxin), FT3/FT4 and death, MACE. We developed and validated an age, biomarker, and clinical history (ABC) model based on FT3 indicators to predict the prognosis of patients with CAD. In the multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, FT3 and FT3/FT4 were independent predictors of mortality (Adjusted HR = 0.624, 95% CI = 0.486–0.801; adjusted HR = 0.011, 95% CI = 0.002–0.07, respectively). Meanwhile, emerging markers pre-brain natriuretic peptide, fibrinogen, and albumin levels are significantly associated with low FT3 (p < 0.001). The new risk death score based on biomarkers can be used to well predict the outcomes of CAD patients (C index of 0.764, 95% CI = 0.731–0.797). Overall, our findings suggest that low levels of FT3 and FT3/FT4 are independent predictors of death and MACE risk in CAD patients.

Consequently, the social network structure of populations plays a key role in shaping infectious disease dynamics. A huge research effort has examined how specific social network structures make populations more (or less) vulnerable to damaging epidemics. However, it can be just as important to understand how social networks can contribute to endemic disease dynamics, in which pathogens are maintained at stable levels for prolonged periods of time. Hosts that can maintain endemic disease may serve as keystone hosts for multi-host pathogens within an ecological community, and also have greater potential to act as key wildlife reservoirs of agricultural and zoonotic diseases. Here, we examine combinations of social and demographic processes that can foster endemic disease in hosts. We synthesise theoretical and empirical work to demonstrate the importance of both social structure and social dynamics in maintaining endemic disease. We also highlight the importance of distinguishing between the local and global persistence of infection and reveal how different social processes drive variation in the scale at which infectious diseases appear endemic. Our synthesis provides a framework by which to understand how sociality contributes to the long-term maintenance of infectious disease in wildlife hosts and provides a set of tools to unpick the social and demographic mechanisms involved in any given host–pathogen system.

57283,Spatial contagion between financial markets: new evidence of asymmetric measures,2021-09-01,"STUDY QUESTION: Is there a variation in ovarian reserve in women who have passed the disease? SUMMARY ANSWER: The fact of having passed SARS-CoV-2 does not affect the ovarian reserve status WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Despite the overwhelming magnitude of this pandemic and its worldwide prevalence, information regarding the effects of the novel coronavirus on human reproduction are currently limited. As the assisted reproductive technology programs resumed operations, it was important to gather information regarding the status of individuals infected with the novel coronavirus, and to assess gametes and reproductive outcomes for those who had SARS-CoV-2 virus. Since it was described the presence of receptors of the virus in the ovary, studies on the reproductive involvement of coronavirus infection are warranted, particularly within recovered patients STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: During the period May-June 2020, women performing an Assisted Reproductive treatment in any of the 11 clinics belonging to the IVIRMA group in Spain and who had a positive IgG for SARS-CoV-2 were invited to participate in the study; this group of women had a previous AMH determination of no more than 6 months. The study was approved by an Institutional Review Board (2007-MADR-052-AR) and all women provided written informed consent. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: A new AMH determination was made (Elecsys(®) AMH, Roche Diagnostics) to detect possible variations in the hormone levels. Women were stratified in two groups, according their previous AMH levels: low responders (AMH < 1 ng/ml) or normo-high responders (AMH ≥ 1 ng/ml) Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences 19.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: After filtering by the inclusion criteria described above, we included 46 patients in this phase of the study; 16 women were diagnosed as having low ovarian reserve (AMH < 1 ng/ml), with an average age of 38.6 years, whereas 30 were classified as having normal ovarian reserve (AMH ≥ 1 ng/ml), with an average age of 34.7 years. Generally, the data show no variation in AMH levels before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection (1.73 ng/ml vs. 1.61 ng/ml, respectively). However, when we analyzed these differences according to the study groups, we observed that, in women with normal ovarian reserve, average AMH level before infection was 4.6 ng/ml, whereas after infection AMH decreased to 3.1 ng/ml. For women with low ovarian reserve, AMH was 0.8 ng/ml before infection and remained at a similar value after infection (AMH = 0.7 ng/ml). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This is an observational study and thus possible confounders cannot be completely excluded. More data are needed to draw firm conclusions it will be critical to increase the sample size to check if the results observed in this work remains in the general population WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The fact of having passed the disease does not affect the ovarian reserve status but the degree of the variation of AMH levels depending on the patient were low or high responder. Nevertheless, we could assume that the chances of success of the Assisted Reproductive treatment remain intact.

This study assessed the direct cytotoxicity of two chemomechanical caries removal agents (Brix 3000™ - BX and Papacarie Duo™ - PD) on pulp cells from deciduous teeth, as well as to assess the morphology and chemical compositions of the dentin surface after the application of these materials. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The cells were seeded (50,000 cells/cm²) in a culture medium (DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum - FBS). After 24 hours, the BX and PD materials were added to 1:20, 1:100, and 1:1000 dilutions. Non-exposed cells were considered as the control group. The viability test (MTT), Trypan Blue assay (TB), and cell morphology (Scanning Electron Microscopy - SEM) were performed after 24 hours of agent application. For the SEM and chemical (energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry - EDS) dentin evaluation, 0.3-mm-thick dentin discs were obtained and divided into control group (no treatment) and surfaces covered with 37% phosphoric acid, BX, or PD. Data were compared by one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test (p<0.05). RESULTS: Decreases in cell viability and numbers of viable cells were observed for both materials, at all dilutions, when compared with the control group (p<0.05). The BX and PD materials did not cause visually perceptible changes, according to SEM, on the surfaces of dentin discs. The EDS analysis did not indicate a statistically significant difference in the levels of calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) between the materials and the control group (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Both materials showed cytotoxicity when in direct contact with the pulp cells from deciduous teeth, and the BX material presented lower cytotoxicity than the PD material.

Many patient encounters in general practice are now conducted by phone or computer as opposed to traditional face-to-face appointments. The aim of this study was to measure patient satisfaction with remote consultations in a primary care setting. Aims To assess patient satisfaction with telephone consultations in a general practice setting and explore patient’s experiences and attitudes toward remote consultations in general practice to formulate recommendations for potential telehealth improvements. Methods A total of 407 patients who had undergone primary care telephone consultations within the previous week were invited to provide feedback. Patient satisfaction was measured by a four-step questionnaire on patient experience, which was quantified on a Likert agreement scale, and the additional option of a comment section at the end of each questionnaire. The responses in the comment section were analysed according to the frequency of recurrent themes. Results The responses of 104 patients were included in the final analysis, and 44 patients used the comment section to provide additional information about their experience. Overall, the satisfaction with remote consultations was high while the rate of technical failure and the need for in-person follow-up were both low: 60 patients (58%) either agreed or strongly agreed that remote consultations are a convenient way of receiving health care and 26 patients (25%) would prefer to have remote consultations over face-to-face ones in the future while 42 patients (40%) would prefer face-to-face consultations in the future. Ninety-six (96) patients (92%) reported no technical problems affecting the consultation quality. Of all 104 face-to-face appointments, only 36 patients (35%) required in-person follow-up. Analyses of the comment section largely reflect the above findings but also highlight concerns from patients that remote consultations can generate additional anxiety, and symptoms might not be communicated effectively or even missed completely. Discussion The high satisfaction levels, low rates of technical failure and low need for a face-to-face follow-up show that in a primary care setting, remote consultations are an effective complement to face-to-face appointments. Nonetheless, the requirement for face-to-face contact goes beyond the need for physical examination alone, with many patients preferring face-to-face contact when discussing complex and sensitive health-related topics and symptoms.","Anderson, Joseph; Walsh, Joanna; Anderson, Martin; Burnley, Rachel",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8498974/,394

Both papers promote optimal mental health and well-being, with an emphasis on early identification and intervention. The first paper explores child and family resilience. Here, we discuss strategies for pediatric CF teams to provide routine, systematic mental health assessment, anticipatory guidance, brief intervention, and triage to evidence-based treatment when needed, while addressing barriers to accessing care. Many mental health conditions emerge before the age of 12, with the potential for lifelong effects on individuals, their family, and society. Living with a chronic illness such as CF can further increase the risk of mental health concerns and, in a bidirectional manner, their consequences for quality of life, sustaining daily care, and health outcomes. There has been a significant focus in recent years on the mental health and wellness of adolescents and adults with CF, but less attention to specifics of depression and anxiety in younger children, or to other common pediatric comorbidities including trauma, developmental disorders such as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and oppositional behavior. Given the availability of psychometrically sound screening instruments and effective interventions, routinely addressing the mental health of children with CF and their families is feasible to integrate within multidisciplinary CF care, allowing for a personalized approach respecting individual needs, values, and goals.

Our aim is to determine whether ALB is a risk factor for an unfavorable clinical outcome and involvement. MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective, single-center study of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Patients with pharmacological hepatotoxicity or liver diseases were excluded. ALB was defined as the elevation of total bilirubin, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and/or GGT above the upper limit of normal. An assessment was first made of the correlation between ALB and the need for hospitalization. This was followed by an assessment of the correlation of hospitalized patients with demographic variables, comorbidities and treatment for COVID-19 and with clinical involvement and outcome. Statistical analysis was performed using age-adjusted multiple logistic regression with a p-value of <0.05 RESULTS: Of 1,277 confirmed cases, 346 required hospitalization, and 302 were included. The prevalence of ALB was higher in hospitalized patients compared to non-hospitalized patients (60.9% vs. 10.3%, p ˂0.001). Among the hospitalized patients, there was no correlation between ALB and demographic variables, comorbidities or treatment for COVID-19, except for low molecular weight heparin. We found a significant correlation between ALB and moderate/severe COVID-19 involvement and between unfavorable clinical outcomes and elevated total bilirubin. The period of greatest clinical worsening and deterioration of liver biochemistry parameters occurred during the first seven days. There was a significant correlation between ALB and a longer hospital stay and admission to the Intensive Care Unit, but this did not imply higher mortality. CONCLUSIONS ALB is correlated with greater clinical involvement and worse clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","Alventosa Mateu, Carlos; Urquijo Ponce, Juan José; Puchades Gimeno, Francesc; Benlloch Pérez, Salvador; Sanz Herrero, Francisco; Latorre Sánchez, Mercedes; García Deltoro, Miguel; Gimeno Cardona, Concepción; Ocete Mochón, María Dolores; Diago Madrid, Moisés",Revista espanola de enfermedades digestivas : organo oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Patologia Digestiva,https://doi.org/10.17235/reed.2021.7842/2021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34157846/,394
61540,Non-perfusing cardiac rhythms in asphyxiated newborn piglets.,2019,"Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment option for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. This study aims to compare the effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) on remission of T2DM. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for studies published between database inception and 21 November 2019. A meta-analysis, using a random effects model, was performed to calculate relative risk (RR) of T2DM remission between the groups in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Of 2650 records identified, 12 records from 10 different RCTs were finally included. The studies comprised 705 patients with follow-up from 1 to 5 years. The remission rate of T2DM at 1 year was higher among those undergoing RYGB (156/276, 57%) compared with those undergoing SG (128/275, 47%), RR (95% CI) 1.20 (1.00-1.45), P = .047, I2 = 24.9%, moderate-quality evidence. Among studies with 2- to 5-year follow-up, there was no difference in remission rates between the RYGB (132/263, 50%) and SG (121/266, 46%) groups, RR 1.06 (0.94-1.20), P = .34, I2 = 0.0%, low-quality evidence. RYGB resulted in a higher rate of T2DM remission compared with SG after 1 year. The T2DM remission rates did not differ in studies with 2- to 5-year follow-up.","Borgeraas, Heidi; Hofsø, Dag; Hertel, Jens Kristoffer; Hjelmesaeth, Jøran",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.13011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32162437/,394
62142,The use of smart technologies in enabling construction components reuse: A viable method or a problem creating solution?,2018,"Italy is currently experiencing an epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Aim of our study is to identify the best predictors of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission in patients with Covid-19. We examined 28 patients admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) and subsequently confirmed as cases of Covid-19. Patients received, at the admission to the ED, a diagnostic work-up including: patient history, clinical examination, an arterial blood gas analysis (whenever possible performed on room air), laboratory blood tests, including serum concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6), lung ultrasound examination and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax. For each patient, as gas exchange index through the alveolocapillary membrane, we determined the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (AaDO⁠2) and the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient augmentation (AaDO⁠2 augmentation). For each patient, as measurement of hypoxemia, we determined oxygen saturation (SpO2), partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO⁠2), PaO⁠2 deficit and the ratio between arterial partial pressure of oxygen by blood gas analysis and fraction of inspired oxygen (P/F). Patients were assigned to ICU Group or to Non-ICU Group basing on the decision to intubate. Areas under the curve (AUC) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used to compare the performance of each test in relation to prediction of ICU admission. Comparing patients of ICU Group (10 patients) with patients of Non-ICU Group (18 patients), we found that the first were older, they had more frequently a medical history of malignancy and they were more frequently admitted to ED for dyspnea. Patients of ICU Group had lower oxygen saturation, PaO⁠2, P/F and higher heart rate, respiratory rate, AaDO⁠2, AaDO⁠2 augmentation and lactate than patients of Non-ICU Group. ROC curves demonstrate that age, heart rate, respiratory rate, dyspnea, lactate, AaDO2, AaDO2 augmentation, white blood cell count, neutrophil count and percentage, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose level, international normalized ratio (INR), blood urea and IL-6 are useful predictors of ICU admission. We identified several predictors of ICU admission in patients with Covid-19. They can act as fast tools for the early identification and timely treatment of critical cases since their arrival in the ED.","Carlino, Maria Viviana; Valenti, Natja; Cesaro, Flavio; Costanzo, Anita; Cristiano, Giovanna; Guarino, Mario; Sforza, Alfonso",Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,https://doi.org/10.4081/monaldi.2020.1410; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32672430/,394

METHOD The review was conducted according to the PRISMA statement and registered in PROSPERO (CRD42017053744). Data were extracted from nine databases. Studies were included if they described training approaches for clinicians or students of any profession learning to interpret videofluoroscopic (VFSS) or barium swallow studies and were written in English. The methods were heterogeneous and a metanalysis was not possible; a narrative review is presented. RESULT Sixteen studies were eligible, including those designed to evaluate the influence of training as well as those that described training as part of validating an assessment tool or method. The quality of the studies was assessed with the Hawker scale and assigned an NHMRC rating. While the evidence was low quality (NHMRC level IV), training consistently improved the accuracy and reliability of clinicians and students conducting VFSS. No studies reported the outcome of training for barium swallow analysis. There was significant variability in the dose, method, and setting of training. CONCLUSION To elucidate best practice in VFSS analysis to ensure training is cost effective and results in accurate diagnosticians requires further research.","Edwards, Ann; Froude, Elspeth; Sharpe, Gabriella; Carding, Paul",International journal of speech-language pathology,https://doi.org/10.1080/17549507.2020.1861327; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33586519/,394

METHODS We aimed to evaluate the duration of SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular immunity according to the clinical severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The study population comprised asymptomatic (n = 14), symptomatic/nonpneumonic (n = 42), and pneumonic (n = 41) patients. RESULTS The anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin class G and neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers lasted until 6 months after diagnosis, with positivity rates of 66.7% and 86.9%, respectively. Older age, prolonged viral shedding, and accompanying pneumonia were more frequently found in patients with sustained humoral immunity. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-specific T-cell response was strongly observed in pneumonic patients and prominent in individuals with sustained humoral immunity. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, most (>85%) patients carry NAb until 6 months after diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, providing insights for establishing vaccination strategies against COVID-19.","Noh, Ji Yun; Kwak, Jeong-Eun; Yang, Jeong-Sun; Hwang, Soon Young; Yoon, Jin Gu; Seong, Hye; Hyun, Hakjun; Lim, Chae Seung; Yoon, Soo-Young; Ryou, Jungsang; Lee, Joo-Yeon; Kim, Sung-Soon; Park, Su-Hyung; Cheong, Hee Jin; Kim, Woo Joo; Shin, Eui-Cheol; Song, Joon Young",The Journal of infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiab124; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34467985/,394
70864,Alternative Pneumocystis Prophylaxis in Solid Organ Transplant Recipients at Two Large Transplant Centers.,2020-09-07,"Background Ageing into adulthood is challenging at baseline, and doing so with a chronic disease can add increased stress and vulnerability. Worldwide, a substantial care gap exists as children transition from care in a paediatric to adult setting. There is no current consensus on safe and equitable healthcare transition (HCT) for patients with chronic disease in resource-denied settings. Much of the existing literature is specific to HIV care. The objective of this narrative review was to summarise current literature related to adolescent HCT not associated with HIV, in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and other resource-denied settings, in order to inform equitable health policy strategies. Methods A literature search was performed using defined search terms in PubMed and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases to identify all peer-reviewed studies published until January 2020, pertaining to paediatric to adult HCT for adolescents and young adults with chronic disease in resource-denied settings. Following deduplication, 1111 studies were screened and reviewed by two independent reviewers, of which 10 studies met the inclusion criteria. Resulting studies were included in thematic analysis and narrative synthesis. Results Twelve subthemes emerged, leading to recommendations which support equitable and age-appropriate adolescent care. Recommendations include (1) improvement of community health education and resilience tools for puberty, reproductive health and mental health comorbidities; (2) strengthening of health systems to create individualised adolescent-responsive policy; (3) incorporation of social and financial resources in the healthcare setting; and (4) formalisation of institution-wide procedures to address community-identified barriers to successful transition. Conclusion Limitations of existing evidence relate to the paucity of formal policy for paediatric to adult transition in LMICs for patients with childhood-onset conditions, in the absence of a diagnosis of HIV. With a rise in successful treatments for paediatric-onset chronic disease, adolescent health and transition programmes are needed to guide effective health policy and risk reduction for adolescents in resource-denied settings.","Narla, Nirmala Priya; Ratner, Leah; Bastos, Fernanda Viera; Owusu, Sheila Agyeiwaa; Osei-Bonsu, Angela; Russ, Christiana M",BMJ paediatrics open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjpo-2021-001059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33959687/,394
71255,"Two doctors are restored to the medical register, matching total for 2019.",2020-12-04,"OBJECTIVES The objectives of this study were to derive Maine Coon haematological and biochemical reference intervals (RIs) from adult healthy blood donors, to validate (or reject) the use of published RIs for the general feline population in this breed, and to evaluate the effects of age, sex and weight on the haematological and biochemical results. METHODS Haematological and biochemical data were retrieved retrospectively from a database of 81 healthy adult Maine Coon cat blood donors and were analysed to generate normal RIs. RIs were determined and compared with established non-breed-specific feline RIs according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines and the American Society of Veterinary Clinical Pathology guidelines using Reference Value-Advisor (version 2.1) software. RESULTS The age of the cats ranged from 1-8 years (mean 4.4 years), 42 were female and 39 were male, and weights ranged from 4.9-8.5 kg (mean 6.7 kg). New Maine Coon RIs were proposed for red blood cell count, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration, reticulocyte count and percentage. Haematocrit was higher in male cats (mean HCT 42.9% vs 41% in females; P = 0.001) and in heavier cats (P = 0.003; slope 1.0, regression equation HCT = 35.1 + 1.0 × weight). New biochemical RIs were proposed for urea, aspartate aminotransferase, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase, total protein and albumin in Maine Coons. Females had higher GGT (median GGT value in females 4.0 vs 3.0 in males; P = 0.011) and albumin values (mean albumin value 3.3 in females vs 3.1 in males; P = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Currently published RIs for some haematological and biochemical parameters are not appropriate for use in adult Maine Coon cats. A breed-specific variation could be a plausible explanation for the new haematological and serum biochemical analytes proposed in this study. Breed-specific RIs for Maine Coon cats will help prevent misinterpretation of laboratory results in diagnosis and in the selection of ideal blood donors.","Spada, Eva; Antognoni, Maria Teresa; Proverbio, Daniela; Ferro, Elisabetta; Mangili, Vittorio; Miglio, Arianna",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/1098612x14567549; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25600080/,394

OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to assess quality of guidelines on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), developed in the early stages of COVID-19 pandemic and assess if recommendations for pharmacotherapy were supported by evidence. PATIENTS AND METHODS We performed the search for documents, that considered antiviral therapies and contained a recommendations for clinicians. The quality of the guidelines was assessed using the AGREE II-Global Rating Scale Instrument and series of additional criteria. RESULTS The analysis included 40 publications. The median of quality of documents assessed with the AGREE II-GRS tool was 2.0 (interquartile range 1.5-2.5). Most documents did not fulfill the rigour of guideline development quality criteria. The AGREE II-GRS scores did not differ significantly across the type of the document, issuing institution and the mode of publication. 75% of documents provided recommendations for the use of antiviral medications despite apparent lack of sufficient evidence supporting such treatments. Of the included documents, 75% were not updated within the 2 months after the publication of the first randomized controlled trial on COVID-19 antiviral therapy. CONCLUSIONS Most guidelines or guidance documents published during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic were of poor quality, contained recommendations for the use of antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection despite only very low quality of evidence available, and were not updated on a regular basis.","Mejza, Filip; Lesniak, Wiktoria; Jaeschke, Roman",Polish archives of internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.20452/pamw.15875; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33720638/,394
72076,Impact of substrate moisture content on growth and metabolic performance of black soldier fly larvae.,2021-04-28,"RATIONALE The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is an immense global health threat that has invoked unheard-of containment measures in numerous countries to reduce the number of new infections. OBJECTIVE The sequential introduction of severe measures, intentionally aiming at reducing the number of new infections, also imposes sharp restrictions on populations with potentially unintended, detrimental effects on public mental health. METHOD We used observational data reflecting the number of phone calls made to national crisis hotlines in Austria and Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic (January 2020-April 2020) to investigate the impact of government restrictions as well as their later revocations on public mental health. Importantly, both countries have comparable health care systems, are similar in their political and socio-economic idiosyncrasies, and took similar restrictive government measures in order to contain COVID-19-but implemented them at different points in time. RESULTS Analysis indicated that the number of crisis hotline calls increased in both countries. This increase seemed to occur at around the same time as the implementation of restrictive governmental responses. Importantly, the revocation of these governmental restrictions (i.e., re-opening the economy, allowing more social contact) seemed to occur at around the same time as the decrease in the number of calls. CONCLUSIONS The present study supports the notion that the implementation of severe measures affects public mental health. However, the negative mental health effects of COVID-19 may be reduced if severe governmental restrictions are kept in place as briefly as possible.","Arendt, Florian; Markiewitz, Antonia; Mestas, Manina; Scherr, Sebastian",Social science & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113532; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33223385/,394
72349,Ethical Issues with Simulating the Bridge Problem in VR.,2020-10-20,"Restrictions on movement in Beijing to limit the COVID-19 epidemic tended to reduce the emissions of primary pollutants. However, changes in pollutant concentrations are also affected by chemical transformation and meteorology. Decreases in concentrations were also not as obvious in Beijing when compared with Hubei Province, where lockdown was especially strict. Declines in concentrations between 2019 and 2020 are evident for both NO2 (37.0 to 26.2 μg m-3) and SO2 (5.86 to 4.15 μg m-3), but there was little evidence of change for PM2.5 (50.0 to 53.8 μg m-3) and CO (0.71 to 0.74 mg m-3). Despite this, Fourier analysis revealed that the weekly cycle of PM2.5 evident in 2019 was not apparent in 2020. In 2019, CO showed both diurnal and weekly signals, but these were absent under the restrictions of 2020. This suggests that while concentrations may remain relatively constant, the temporal distribution of pollutants can show subtle changes under restrictions imposed in attempts to limit the spread of the coronavirus.","Brimblecombe, Peter; Lai, Yonghang",Faraday discussions,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0fd00082e; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33241802/,394

Methods: Viral RNA was extracted in throat swab and sputum sample of the patient and was performed real-time reverse transcription PCR detection and obtained viral genome by high-throughput sequencing method. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using 29 2019-nCoV genomes and 30 β-coronavirus genomes deposited in NCBI GenBank. Fifteen genomes from Wuhan were grouped by mutation sites and others were identified by Wuhan's or specific mutation sites. Results: A 29 833 bp length genome of the first 2019-nCoV strain in Hangzhou was obtained, covering full length of the coding regions of coronavirus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the genome was closest to the genome of a bat SARS-like coronavirus strain RaTG13 with an identity of 96.11% (28 666/29 826). Among the genes between two genomes, E genes were highly conserved (99.56%), while S genes had lowest identity (92.87%), suggesting that S gene was of a faster evolutionary rate. The genome sequence similarities among 29 strains from China (Hangzhou, Wuhan, and Shenzhen), Japan, USA, and Finland, were all more than 99.9%; however, some single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in some strains. Conclusion: The genome of Hangzhou 2019-nCoV strain was very close to the genomes of strains from other cities in China and overseas collected at early epidemic phase. The 2019-nCoV genome sequencing method used in this paper provides an useful tool for monitoring variation of viral genes.","Yu, H; Wang, X C; Li, J; Qian, X; Yu, X F; Sun, Z; Chen, J F; Kao, Q J; Wang, H Q; Pan, J C",Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine],https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112150-20200217-00128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171191/,394

This study aims to determine the yield of CTA and MRA in a prospective cohort of patients with SAH and a negative initial catheter angiogram. METHODS From January 1, 2005, until September 1, 2010, the authors instituted a prospective protocol in which patients with SAH-as documented by noncontrast CT or CSF xanthochromia and a negative initial catheter angiogram- were evaluated using CTA and MRA to assess for causative cerebral aneurysms. Two neuroradiologists independently evaluated the noncontrast CT scans to determine the SAH pattern (perimesencephalic or not) and the CT and MR angiograms to assess for causative cerebral aneurysms. RESULTS Seventy-seven patients were included, with a mean age of 52.8 years (median 54 years, range 19-88 years). Fifty patients were female (64.9%) and 27 male (35.1%). Forty-three patients had nonperimesencephalic SAH (55.8%), 29 patients had perimesencephalic SAH (37.7%), and 5 patients had CSF xanthochromia (6.5%). Computed tomography angiography demonstrated a causative cerebral aneurysm in 4 patients (5.2% yield), all of whom had nonperimesencephalic SAH (9.3% yield). Mean aneurysm size was 2.6 mm (range 2.1-3.3 mm). Magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated only 1 of these aneurysms. No causative cerebral aneurysms were found in patients with perimesencephalic SAH or CSF xanthochromia. CONCLUSIONS Computed tomography angiography is a valuable adjunct in the evaluation of patients with nonperimesencephalic SAH who have a negative initial catheter angiogram, demonstrating a causative cerebral aneurysm in 9.3% of patients.","Delgado Almandoz, Josser E; Jagadeesan, Bharathi D; Refai, Daniel; Moran, Christopher J; Cross, DeWitte T; Chicoine, Michael R; Rich, Keith M; Diringer, Michael N; Dacey, Ralph G; Derdeyn, Colin P; Zipfel, Gregory J",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2012.4.jns112306; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22680242/,394

HBoV infections show a seasonal distribution with the peak in temperate areas being in the winter months. METHODS In our study, 35 throat swabs from children under 5 years with acute respiratory symptoms and 61 stool samples from children (<5 years) with acute gastroenteritis were collected in the period of October 2007-March 2008. A HBoV-specific polymerase chain reaction for detection of the virus, and sequence analysis for identification of virus variants were performed. RESULTS Although respiratory samples were all negative, 3.3% of stool samples (2/61) proved to be positive for HBoV. The virus carrier children were 3 and 5 years old. The ratio of HBoV positive samples is similar to international results (2.1-5.5%).

In this paper, we aim to describe some evolving concepts associated with the design and conduct of RCTs and outline new approaches aiming to increase efficiency and reduce costs. RECENT FINDINGS A well-powered and performed RCT is usually a study involving several different centers from different geographical areas that enrolls a large number of patients in diverse clinical settings. Altogether, these features increase the generalizability of the study and make the rapid implementation of the findings more likely. However, this does not come without cost. Among several possible alternatives to conventional RCTs, the most important ones are related to the unit of randomization (individual vs. cluster), study design (conventional vs. adaptive), randomization scheme (fixed vs. response-adaptive), data collection (conventional case report forms vs. registry-embedded) and statistical approach (frequentist vs. Bayesian). SUMMARY While conventional RCTs remain the gold standard for generating evidence, new trial designs may be considered to reduce sample size and costs while improving trial efficiency and power. However, they raise new challenges for testing feasibility, conduct, ethical oversight and statistical analysis.","Serpa Neto, Ary; Goligher, Ewan C; Hodgson, Carol L",Current opinion in critical care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcc.0000000000000854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34334624/,394
75765,Neurofilaments: neurobiological foundations for biomarker applications.,2020-05-14,"Biotin-labeled molecular probes, comprising specific regions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, would be helpful in the isolation and characterization of antibodies targeting this recently emerged pathogen. To develop such probes, we designed constructs incorporating an N-terminal purification tag, a site-specific protease-cleavage site, the probe region of interest, and a C-terminal sequence targeted by biotin ligase. Probe regions included full-length spike ectodomain as well as various subregions, and we also designed mutants to eliminate recognition of the ACE2 receptor. Yields of biotin-labeled probes from transient transfection ranged from ~0.5 mg/L for the complete ectodomain to >5 mg/L for several subregions. Probes were characterized for antigenicity and ACE2 recognition, and the structure of the spike ectodomain probe was determined by cryo-electron microscopy. We also characterized antibody-binding specificities and cell-sorting capabilities of the biotinylated probes. Altogether, structure-based design coupled to efficient purification and biotinylation processes can thus enable streamlined development of SARS-CoV-2 spike-ectodomain probes.

79332,Going forward in a new world.,2020-06-09,"OPINION STATEMENT The incidence of vascular access site related complications ranges between 0.8 % to 1.8 % of diagnostic cardiac catheterization and up to 9 % of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) [1]. The femoral vessels at the groin are used as the access site for the majority of percutaneous coronary, peripheral arterial and venous, and electrophysiologic interventions. With emergence of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR), thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR), and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), larger access sheaths (up to 18Fr-24Fr) are required, which further increases the potential for access site complications. The true incidence of access site complications arising from non-coronary interventions is unknown; hence it is likely that the total incidence of vascular access site complications is greatly underestimated. Vascular closure devices (VCDs), radial artery access, fluoroscopic guidance, and ultrasound guidance have all been used with a hope to minimize these complications. Despite these attempts, vascular access complications have not been eliminated. Cardiovascular specialists must promptly identify these complications and manage them appropriately.","Kolluri, Raghu; Fowler, Brian; Nandish, Shailesh",Current treatment options in cardiovascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11936-013-0227-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23378180/,394

AIMS We aimed to compare long-term QOL between patients who had undergone ET versus esophagectomy. METHODS Patients were included if they underwent ET or esophagectomy at the University of Michigan since 2000 for the treatment of HGD or T1a EAC. Two validated survey QOL questionnaires were mailed to the patients. We compared QOL between and within groups (ET = 91, esophagectomy = 62), adjusting for covariates. RESULTS The median time since initial intervention was 6.8 years. Compared to esophagectomy, ET patients tended to be older, had a lower prevalence of EAC, and had a shorter duration since therapy. ET patients had worse adjusted physical and role functioning than esophagectomy patients. However, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of having symptoms was significantly less with ET for diarrhea (0.287; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.114, 0.724), trouble eating (0.207; 0.0766, 0.562), choking (0.325; 0.119, 0.888), coughing (0.291; 0.114, 0.746), and speech difficulty (0.306; 0.0959, 0.978). Amongst the ET patients, we found that the number of therapy sessions and need for dilation were associated with worse outcomes. DISCUSSION Multiple measures of symptom status were better with ET compared to esophagectomy following treatment of BE with HGD or T1a EAC. We observed worse long-term physical and role functioning in ET patients which could reflect unmeasured baseline functional status rather than a causal effect of ET.","Reddy, Chanakyaram A; Tavakkoli, Anna; Chen, Vincent L; Korsnes, Sheryl; Bedi, Aarti Oza; Carrott, Philip W; Chang, Andrew C; Lagisetty, Kiran H; Kwon, Richard S; Elmunzer, B Joseph; Orringer, Mark B; Piraka, Cyrus; Prabhu, Anoop; Reddy, Rishindra M; Wamsteker, Erik; Rubenstein, Joel H",Digestive diseases and sciences,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10620-020-06377-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32519141/,394

They have been associated with higher morbidity and mortality among children, elderly individuals, and immunosuppressed patients. In April 2009, the circulation of a new influenza A virus (FLUA H1N1v) was responsible for the first influenza pandemic of this century. We report the clinical and epidemiological profiles of inpatients infected with CRVs or with FLUA H1N1v at a tertiary care hospital in southern Brazil. In addition, we used these profiles to evaluate survivor and nonsurvivor patients infected with FLUA H1N1v. Multiplex reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and real time RT-PCR were used to detect viruses in inpatients with respiratory infections. Record data from all patients were reviewed. A total of 171 patients were examined over a period of 16 weeks. Of these, 39% were positive for FLUA H1N1v, 36% were positive for CRVs, and 25% were negative. For the FLUA H1N1v- and CRV-infected patients, epidemiological data regarding median age (30 and 1.5 years), myalgia (44% and 13%), need for mechanical ventilation (44% and 9%), and mortality (35% and 9%) were statistically different. In a multivariate analysis comparing survivor and nonsurvivor patients infected with influenza A virus H1N1, median age and creatine phosphokinase levels were significantly associated with a severe outcome. Seasonal respiratory infections are a continuing concern. Our results highlight the importance of studies on the prevalence and severity of these infections and that investments in programs of clinical and laboratory monitoring are essential to detect the appearance of new infective agents.","Raboni, Sonia M; Stella, Vanessa; Cruz, Cristina R; França, João B; Moreira, Suzana; Gonçalves, Lili; Nogueira, Meri B; Vidal, Luine R; Almeida, Sergio M; Debur, Maria C; Carraro, Hipolito; dos Santos, Claudia N Duarte",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.02205-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21248084/,394

The aim of the present study was to determine the extent by which corticospinal excitability is influenced during direct Achilles tendon vibration. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were elicited in the soleus (SOL), gastrocnemius medialis (GM) and tibialis anterior (TA) by transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortical area of the leg with and without Achilles tendon vibration at various frequencies (50, 80 and 110 Hz). Contralateral homologues were also investigated. SOL and GM MEP amplitude significantly increased by 226 ± 188 and 66 ± 39%, respectively, during Achilles tendon vibration, without any difference between the tested frequencies. No MEP changes were reported for TA or contralateral homologues. Increased SOL and GM MEP amplitude suggests increased vibration-induced corticospinal excitability independent of vibration frequency.","Lapole, Thomas; Temesi, John; Gimenez, Philippe; Arnal, Pierrick J; Millet, Guillaume Y; Petitjean, Michel",Experimental brain research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00221-014-4125-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25370344/,394

We further show here that high levels of AXL and EMT were frequently expressed in subsets of both treatment-naïve and treatment-relapsed NSCLC. Previously, we and others have demonstrated a role for AXL in mediating DNA damage repair (DDR) as well as resistance to inhibition of WEE1, a replication stress response kinase. Here, we show that BGB324 (bemcentinib), a selective small-molecule AXL inhibitor, caused DNA damage and induced replication stress, indicated by ATR/CHK1 phosphorylation, more significantly in TP53-deficient NSCLC cell lines. Similar effects were also observed in large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) cell lines. High AXL protein levels were also associated with resistance to ATR inhibition. Combined inhibition of AXL and ATR significantly decreased cell proliferation of NSCLC and LCNEC cell lines. Mechanistically, combined inhibition of AXL and ATR significantly increased RPA32 hyper-phosphorylation and DNA double strand breaks and induced markers of mitotic catastrophe. Notably, NSCLC cell lines with low levels of SLFN11, a known predictive biomarker for platinum and PARP inhibitor sensitivity, were more sensitive to AXL/ATR co-targeting. These findings demonstrate a novel and unexpected role for AXL in replication stress tolerance, with potential therapeutic implications. Implications: These findings demonstrate that the combination of AXL and ATR inhibitors could be a promising therapeutic combination for NSCLC, LCNEC and other cancers.","Ramkumar, Kavya; Stewart, C Allison; Cargill, Kasey R; Della Corte, Carminia M; Wang, Qi; Shen, Li; Diao, Lixia; Cardnell, Robert Jg; Peng, David H; Rodriguez, B Leticia; Fan, You-Hong; Heymach, John V; Wang, Jing; Gay, Carl M; Gibbons, Don L; Byers, Lauren Averett",Molecular cancer research : MCR,https://doi.org/10.1158/1541-7786.mcr-20-0414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33172976/,394

The psychological status of cancer survivors is affected by their social environment. In this study, we investigated the psychological status and psychological symptoms of Chinese cancer survivors. METHODS A longitudinal study design was adopted, and an online sample of cancer survivors was successfully recruited via the internet communities of cancer support groups. From February 14 to May 25, 111 cancer survivor families completed the symptom checklist 90 (SCL-90) online three times (T1: February 14 to 24; T2: April 1 to 10; T3: May 15 to 25). RESULTS For survivors and their family members, the mean total score of the SCL-90 was 172.05 (13.30) and 142.76 (26.80) at T1, 155.91 (12.18) and 133.42 (15.93) at T2, and 142.75 (11.56) and 130.14 (14.16) at T3, respectively. The SCL-90 scores of cancer survivors were significantly higher than those of family members and Chinese norms at T1, T2, and T3. Nine psychological symptoms of the SCL-90 in cancer survivors significantly declined from T1 to T2 and T3.

A series of small molecule benzenesulfonamide based CA-IX inhibitors containing novel tridentate chelates complexed with the M(CO)(3) core (M = Re or (99m)Tc) were designed and synthesized. The in vitro binding affinity of the benzenesulfonamide rhenium complexes yielded IC(50) values ranging from 3 to 116 nM in hypoxic CA-IX expressing HeLa cells. One of the most potent compounds, 3d (IC(50) = 9 nM), was radiolabeled with technetium tricarbonyl ({(99m)Tc(CO)(3)}(+)) to afford the {(99m)Tc(CO)(3)}(+) complex in excellent yield and high purity.

100992,Why computer science should be a core component of the medical curriculum.,2020-10-15,"Cellulose is the most abundant biomass on Earth, and many microorganisms depend on it as a source of energy. It consists mainly of crystalline and amorphous regions, and natural degradation of the crystalline part is highly dependent on the degree of processivity of the degrading enzymes (i.e., the extent of continuous hydrolysis without detachment from the substrate cellulose). Here, we report high-speed atomic force microscopic (HS-AFM) observations of the movement of four types of cellulases derived from the cellulolytic bacteria Cellulomonas fimi on various insoluble cellulose substrates. The HS-AFM images clearly demonstrated that two of them (CfCel6B and CfCel48A) slide on crystalline cellulose. The direction of processive movement of CfCel6B is from the nonreducing to the reducing end of the substrate, which is opposite that of processive cellulase Cel7A of the fungus Trichoderma reesei (TrCel7A), whose movement was first observed by this technique, while CfCel48A moves in the same direction as TrCel7A. When CfCel6B and TrCel7A were mixed on the same substrate, ""traffic accidents"" were observed, in which the two cellulases blocked each other's progress. The processivity of CfCel6B was similar to those of fungal family 7 cellulases but considerably higher than those of fungal family 6 cellulases. The results indicate that bacteria utilize family 6 cellulases as high-processivity enzymes for efficient degradation of crystalline cellulose, whereas family 7 enzymes have the same function in fungi. This is consistent with the idea of convergent evolution of processive cellulases in fungi and bacteria to achieve similar functionality using different protein foldings.","Uchiyama, Taku; Uchihashi, Takayuki; Nakamura, Akihiko; Watanabe, Hiroki; Kaneko, Satoshi; Samejima, Masahiro; Igarashi, Kiyohiko",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2011366117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747547/,394

Here we compare our series of RRLDHs with a similar cohort undergoing open right lobe donor hepatectomy (ORLDH) with a propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis. Among 263 consecutive adult patients undergoing right lobe living donor hepatectomy from January 2015 until July 2019, 35 RRLDHs were matched to 70 ORLDHs. A 1:2 PSM analysis was performed to make the groups comparable for donor gender, age, and body mass index (BMI) and recipient gender, age, BMI, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, and indication for transplant. Operative time was longer in RRLDHs compared to ORLDHs (504 ± 73.5 vs. 331 ± 65.1 minutes; P < 0.001) but significantly decreased with the number of cases (P < 0.001). No conversions occurred. The warm ischemia time was longer and blood loss significantly less in RRLDHs (P = 0.001 and 0.003, respectively). Overall donor complications were similar: 2 (5.7%) in RRLDHs versus 12 (17.1%) in ORLDHs (P = 0.13). Biliary leak occurred in 1 (3%) robotic case and 2 (3%) cases with the conventional approach. Donors undergoing robotic surgery required less patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) and had a shorter hospital stay compared to the open surgery group (P = 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). No significant differences in graft anatomical data and recipient outcomes were recorded. Conclusion: RRLDH is feasible, safe, and reproducible, with significantly decreased blood loss and a shorter hospital stay compared to the open procedure. The first 35 robotic cases showed a substantial reduction in operative time, reflecting a rapid shortening of the learning curve.","Broering, Dieter; Elsheikh, Yasser; Alnemary, Yasir; Zidan, Ahmed; Elsarawy, Ahmed; Saleh, Yahia; Alabbad, Saleh; Sturdevant, Mark; Wu, Yao-Ming; Troisi, Roberto",Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society,https://doi.org/10.1002/lt.25820; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32542956/,394

We designed a study with the objective of describing the frequency of respiratory viruses, especially rhinovirus (RV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human bocavirus (HBoV) in hospitalized children with CAP. METHODS A 6-year prospective study was conducted in children <14 years old admitted to the Pediatrics Department of the Severo Ochoa Hospital (Spain) with CAP. We studied the frequency of 16 respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirates. Clinical characteristics of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-only infections were compared with those of RV, HMPV and HBoV single infections. RESULTS A viral pathogen was identified in 649 (73.4%) of 884 hospitalized children with CAP. Viral coinfections were detected in 30%. The rate of viral detection was significantly greater in infants <18 months (83%) than in older children (67%) (P < 0.001). The most frequently detected virus was RSV with 41.6% of positive patients followed by RV (26.2%), HBoV (17.8%), adenovirus (17.8%), HMPV (7%) and parainfluenza (7%). RSV was the most frequent virus in children <18 months, but RV was most common in the eldest group (P < 0.001).

Biopsies, bronchoalveolar lavage and peripheral blood samples of 133 immunocompromised patients (pts) were investigated by a multifungal DNA-microarray as well as a nested Aspergillus specific PCR assay. Patients had proven (n = 18), probable (n = 29), possible (n = 48) and no IFD (n = 38) and were mostly under antifungal therapy at the time of sampling. The results were compared to culture, histopathology, imaging and serology, respectively. For the non-Aspergillus IFD the microarray analysis yielded in all samples a sensitivity of 64% and a specificity of 80%. Best results for the detection of all IFD were achieved by combining DNA-microarray and Aspergillus specific PCR in biopsy samples (sensitivity 79%; specificity 71%). The molecular assays in combination identify genomic DNA of fungal pathogens and may improve identification of causative pathogens of IFD and help overcoming the diagnostic uncertainty of culture and/or histopathology findings, even during antifungal therapy.","Boch, T; Reinwald, M; Postina, P; Cornely, O A; Vehreschild, J J; Heußel, C P; Heinz, W J; Hoenigl, M; Eigl, S; Lehrnbecher, T; Hahn, J; Claus, B; Lauten, M; Egerer, G; Müller, M C; Will, S; Merker, N; Hofmann, W-K; Buchheidt, D; Spiess, B",Mycoses,https://doi.org/10.1111/myc.12424; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26497302/,394

As Unc-51 and Atg1, ULK1 regulates both axon growth and autophagy, respectively, in mammalian cells. However, a novel immunoregulatory role of ULK1 has been recently described. This kinase was shown to be required for regulation of both type I interferon (IFN) production and induction of type I IFN signaling. Optimal regulation of IFN production is crucial for generation of effective IFN-immune responses, and defects in such networks can be detrimental for the host leading to uncontrolled pathogen infection, tumor growth, or autoimmune diseases. Thus, ULK1 plays a central role in IFN-dependent immunity. Here we review the diverse roles of ULK1, with special focus on its importance to type I IFN signaling, and highlight important future study questions.","Saleiro, Diana; Kosciuczuk, Ewa M; Platanias, Leonidas C",Cytokine & growth factor reviews,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cytogfr.2016.03.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27068414/,394

Without effective drugs to cure COVID-19, early identification and control of risk factors are important measures to combat COVID-19. This study was conducted to determine the clinical profile and risk factors associated with mortality among COVID-19 patients in a tertiary care hospital in South India. This record-based longitudinal study was conducted by reviewing the case records of COVID-19 patients admitted for treatment from June 2020 to September 2020 in a tertiary care centre in South India. The clinical details, discharge/death details, were collected and entered in MS Excel. Potential risk factors for COVID-19 mortality were analysed using univariate binomial logistic regression, generalized linear models (GLM) with Poisson distribution. Survival curves were made using the Kaplan-Meier method. Log-rank test was used to test the equality of survivor functions between the groups. Out of 854 COVID-19 patients, 56.6% were men and the mean (standard deviation) age was 45.3(17.2) years. The median survival time was significantly lesser in male COVID-19 patients (16 days) as compared to female patients (20 days). Increasing age, male gender, patients presenting with symptoms of fever, cough, breathlessness, smoking, alcohol consumption, comorbidities were significantly associated with mortality among COVID-19 patients. Patients with older age, male gender, breathlessness, fever, cough, smoking and alcohol and comorbidities need careful observation and early intervention.

Susan Bredlau has recently presented a reading of Plato's dialogue Charmides, which portrays Socrates as a pioneer of the phenomenological approach to illness. I use a critical discussion of Bredlau's interpretation of the Charmides to show that the phenomenology of illness also has its shortcomings and needs to be complemented by still other approaches. While Bredlau does make a number of highly apt and relevant suggestions as to how a narrow biomedical approach to illness may be corrected, some (but not all) of which are related to phenomenology, the attribution to Plato's Socrates of a phenomenological approach is mistaken. Characteristically, Socrates shows little interest in the personal experience of a patient. He is more concerned with the patient's lifestyle and conduct and so suggests an alternative or complementary perspective, stressing the importance of education and prevention to health care.","Klausen, Søren Harnow",The Journal of medicine and philosophy,https://doi.org/10.1093/jmp/jhab019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34370028/,394

The aim of this study was to compare the performance of the RSBI calculated by the traditional method (described in 1991) with that of the RSBI calculated directly from MV parameters. METHODS This was a prospective observational study involving patients who had been on MV for more than 24 h and were candidates for weaning. The RSBI was obtained by the same examiner using the two different methods (employing a spirometer and the parameters from the ventilator display) at random. In comparing the values obtained with the two methods, we used the Mann-Whitney test, Pearson's linear correlation test, and Bland-Altman plots. The performance of the methods was compared by evaluation of the areas under the ROC curves. RESULTS Of the 109 selected patients (60 males; mean age, 62 ± 20 years), 65 were successfully weaned, and 36 died. There were statistically significant differences between the two methods for respiratory rate, tidal volume, and RSBI (p < 0.001 for all). However, when the two methods were compared, the concordance and the intra-observer variation coefficient were 0.94 (0.92-0.96) and 11.16%, respectively. The area under the ROC curve was similar for both methods (0.81 ± 0.04 vs. 0.82 ± 0.04; p = 0.935), which is relevant in the context of this study. CONCLUSIONS The satisfactory performance of the RSBI as a predictor of weaning success, regardless of the method employed, demonstrates the utility of the method using the mechanical ventilator.","Souza, Leonardo Cordeiro de; Lugon, Jocemir Ronaldo",Jornal brasileiro de pneumologia : publicacao oficial da Sociedade Brasileira de Pneumologia e Tisilogia,https://doi.org/10.1590/s1806-37132015000000077; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26785962/,394

We investigated the consistency of the association between thalamus volume and cognition in MS for two common automated segmentation approaches, as well as fully manual outlining. METHODS Standardized neuropsychological assessment and 3-Tesla 3D-T1-weighted brain MRI were collected (multi-center) from 57 MS patients and 17 healthy controls. Thalamus segmentations were generated manually and using five automated methods. Agreement between the algorithms and manual outlines was assessed with Bland-Altman plots; linear regression assessed the presence of proportional bias. The effect of segmentation method on the separation of cognitively impaired (CI) and preserved (CP) patients was investigated through Generalized Estimating Equations; associations with cognitive measures were investigated using linear mixed models, for each method and vendor. RESULTS In smaller thalami, automated methods systematically overestimated volumes compared to manual segmentations [ρ=(-0.42)-(-0.76); p-values < 0.001). All methods significantly distinguished CI from CP MS patients, except manual outlines of the left thalamus (p = 0.23). Poorer global neuropsychological test performance was significantly associated with smaller thalamus volumes bilaterally using all methods. Vendor significantly affected the findings. CONCLUSION Automated and manual thalamus segmentation consistently demonstrated an association between thalamus atrophy and cognitive impairment in MS. However, a proportional bias in smaller thalami and choice of MRI acquisition system might impact the effect size of these findings.","Burggraaff, Jessica; Liu, Yao; Prieto, Juan C; Simoes, Jorge; de Sitter, Alexandra; Ruggieri, Serena; Brouwer, Iman; Lissenberg-Witte, Birgit I; Rocca, Mara A; Valsasina, Paola; Ropele, Stefan; Gasperini, Claudio; Gallo, Antonio; Pareto, Deborah; Sastre-Garriga, Jaume; Enzinger, Christian; Filippi, Massimo; De Stefano, Nicola; Ciccarelli, Olga; Hulst, Hanneke E; Wattjes, Mike P; Barkhof, Frederik; Uitdehaag, Bernard M J; Vrenken, Hugo; Guttmann, Charles R G",NeuroImage.

This pilot study assessed the occurrence of adhesions to full-sized Polypropylene and Gore-tex DualMesh Plus meshes and the possibility for adhesion prevention using fibrin sealant. METHODS Two 10-cm to 15-cm pieces of mesh were placed and fixed laparoscopically in pigs (25kg to 55kg). Group I: 2 animals with Polypropylene mesh on one side and DualMesh on other side. Group II: 2 animals with DualMesh on each side with fibrin sealant applied to the periphery of mesh and staples to one side. Group III: 1 animal with 2 pieces of Polypropylene mesh with fibrin sealant applied to the entire mesh. All animals underwent laparoscopy 3 months later to assess the extent of adhesions, and full-thickness specimens were removed for histological evaluation. RESULTS More Polypropylene mesh was involved in adhesions than DualMesh. However, with the DualMesh involved in adhesions, more of the surface area was involved in forming adhesions than with Polypropylene mesh. None of the implanted DualMesh had visceral adhesions, while 2 out of 3 Polypropylene meshes had adhesions to both the liver and spleen but none to the bowel. Implanted Polypropylene mesh with fibrin sealant had no adhesions. DualMesh had shrunk more significantly than Polypropylene mesh. Histological evaluation showed absence of acute inflammatory response, significantly more chronic inflammatory response to DualMesh compared to Polypropylene and complete mesothelialization with both meshes. There was extensive collagen deposition between Polypropylene mesh fibers, while fibrosis occurred on both sides of DualMesh with synovial metaplasia over its peritoneal surface akin to encapsulation. CONCLUSIONS DualMesh caused fewer omental and visceral adhesions than Polypropylene mesh did. Fibrin sealant eliminated adhesions to DualMesh and prevented adhesions to Polypropylene mesh when applied over the entire surface.

However, DHSV lacks standardized, published operating procedure for processing and analyzing samples. It also uses living respiratory epithelium, a significant infection control issue during the COVID-19 pandemic. To continue providing a diagnostic service during this health crisis, the ciliary videomicroscopy protocol has been adapted to include adequate infection control measures. Here, we describe a revised protocol for sampling and laboratory processing of ciliated respiratory samples, highlighting adaptations made to comply with COVID-19 infection control measures. Representative results of CFA from nasal brushing samples obtained from 16 healthy subjects, processed and analyzed according to this protocol, are described. We also illustrate the importance of obtaining and processing optimal quality epithelial ciliated strips, as samples not meeting quality selection criteria do now allow for CFA, potentially decreasing the diagnostic reliability and the efficiency of this technique.","Bricmont, Noemie; Benchimol, Lionel; Poirrier, Anne-Lise; Grignet, Christine; Seaton, Claire; Chilvers, Mark A; Seghaye, Marie-Christine; Louis, Renaud; Lefebvre, Philippe; Kempeneers, Celine",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/61949; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33226018/,394

This study examined the distribution of functional status 3 months after stroke, determined whether these outcomes vary among hospitals, and identified hospital characteristics associated with better (or worse) functional outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS Observational analysis of the AVAIL study (Adherence Evaluation After Ischemic Stroke-Longitudinal) included 2083 ischemic stroke patients enrolled from 82 US hospitals participating in Get With The Guidelines-Stroke and AVAIL. The primary outcome was dependence or death at 3 months (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score of 3-6). Secondary outcomes included functional dependence (mRS score of 3-5), disabled (mRS score of 2-5), and mRS evaluated as a continuous score. By 3 months post-discharge, 36.5% of patients were functionally dependent or dead. Rates of dependence or death varied widely by discharging hospitals (range: 0%-67%). After risk adjustment, patients had lower rates of 3-month dependence or death when treated at teaching hospitals (odds ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.54-0.96) and certified primary stroke centers (odds ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-0.91). In contrast, a composite measure of hospital-level adherence to acute stroke care performance metrics, stroke volume, and bed size was not associated with downstream patient functional status. Findings were robust across mRS end points and sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS One third of acute ischemic stroke patients were functionally dependent or dead 3 months postacute stroke; functional recovery rates varied considerably among hospitals, supporting the need to better determine which care processes can maximize functional outcomes.","Bettger, Janet Prvu; Thomas, Laine; Liang, Li; Xian, Ying; Bushnell, Cheryl D; Saver, Jeffrey L; Fonarow, Gregg C; Peterson, Eric D",Circulation.

Previous studies demonstrated that concentrations of CCL11 are elevated in the sera and cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) of patients with neuroinflammatory disorders, including multiple sclerosis. Moreover, the levels of CCL11 in plasma and CSF increase with age, and CCL11 suppresses adult neurogenesis in the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in memory impairment. However, the precise source and function of CCL11 in the CNS are not fully understood. In this study, we found that activated astrocytes release CCL11, whereas microglia predominantly express the CCL11 receptor. CCL11 significantly promoted the migration of microglia, and induced microglial production of reactive oxygen species by upregulating nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase 1 (NOX1), thereby promoting excitotoxic neuronal death. These effects were reversed by inhibition of NOX1. Our findings suggest that CCL11 released from activated astrocytes triggers oxidative stress via microglial NOX1 activation and potentiates glutamate-mediated neurotoxicity, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders.","Parajuli, Bijay; Horiuchi, Hiroshi; Mizuno, Tetsuya; Takeuchi, Hideyuki; Suzumura, Akio",Glia,https://doi.org/10.1002/glia.22892; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26184677/,394

Here, we demonstrate that the differences in in vitro susceptibility of equine CD3+ T lymphocytes to EAV infection have a genetic basis. To investigate the possible hereditary basis for this trait, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to compare susceptible and resistant phenotypes. Testing of 267 DNA samples from four horse breeds that had a susceptible or a resistant CD3+ T lymphocyte phenotype using both Illumina Equine SNP50 BeadChip and Sequenom's MassARRAY system identified a common, genetically dominant haplotype associated with the susceptible phenotype in a region of equine chromosome 11 (ECA11), positions 49572804 to 49643932. The presence of a common haplotype indicates that the trait occurred in a common ancestor of all four breeds, suggesting that it may be segregated among other modern horse breeds. Biological pathway analysis revealed several cellular genes within this region of ECA11 encoding proteins associated with virus attachment and entry, cytoskeletal organization, and NF-κB pathways that may be associated with the trait responsible for the in vitro susceptibility/resistance of CD3+ T lymphocytes to EAV infection. The data presented in this study demonstrated a strong association of genetic markers with the trait, representing de facto proof that the trait is under genetic control. To our knowledge, this is the first GWAS of an equine infectious disease and the first GWAS of equine viral arteritis.","Go, Yun Young; Bailey, Ernest; Cook, Deborah G; Coleman, Stephen J; Macleod, James N; Chen, Kuey-Chu; Timoney, Peter J; Balasuriya, Udeni B R",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.06068-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21994447/,394

Yet, save for a few fragmented studies, climate economics has either ignored them or represented them in highly stylized ways. We provide unified estimates of the economic impacts of all eight climate tipping points covered in the economic literature so far using a meta-analytic integrated assessment model (IAM) with a modular structure. The model includes national-level climate damages from rising temperatures and sea levels for 180 countries, calibrated on detailed econometric evidence and simulation modeling. Collectively, climate tipping points increase the social cost of carbon (SCC) by ∼25% in our main specification. The distribution is positively skewed, however. We estimate an ∼10% chance of climate tipping points more than doubling the SCC. Accordingly, climate tipping points increase global economic risk. A spatial analysis shows that they increase economic losses almost everywhere. The tipping points with the largest effects are dissociation of ocean methane hydrates and thawing permafrost. Most of our numbers are probable underestimates, given that some tipping points, tipping point interactions, and impact channels have not been covered in the literature so far; however, our method of structural meta-analysis means that future modeling of climate tipping points can be integrated with relative ease, and we present a reduced-form tipping points damage function that could be incorporated in other IAMs.","Dietz, Simon; Rising, James; Stoerk, Thomas; Wagner, Gernot",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2103081118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400500/,394

Within the first year, graft failure and multi-organ failure (possibly secondary to graft failure) are common causes of mortality. To better understand the prognosis within the first year, we plan on conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies addressing the association between the patient, donor, and transplant operative factors and graft loss 1-year post-lung transplant. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register, and PubMed supplemental for non-MEDLINE records for observational studies identifying independent risk factors for early mortality (1 year) in adult lung transplant recipients. We plan on including cohort studies and secondary analyses of randomized controlled trials studying adult lung transplant recipients undergoing their first lung transplant, without any simultaneous organ transplant. We will conduct a random-effects meta-analysis that pools the effect estimates from all eligible studies to obtain a summary estimate and confidence interval for all independent non-therapeutic factors identified in the primary studies. DISCUSSION The results from this study may inform future guidelines on the selection of candidates and donors for transplantation and predictive model development and inform the decision-making process that the physician and patient undertake together. Furthermore, through the conduction of this review, we can identify the limitations with the current best evidence, which will encourage the need for studies with a better methodology to reassess the predictors of mortality.","Foroutan, Farid; Guyatt, Gordon; Friesen, Erik; Lozano, Luis Enrique Colunga; Sidhu, Aman; Meade, Maureen",Systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-019-1049-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31159866/,394

METHODS Written surveys and semi-structured interviews of non-physician clinical managers and physician medical directors were conducted using the 2009 H1N1 pandemic as a case-based scenario at 5 university-affiliated family medicine clinics. Domains assessed included perceived pandemic threat; value, existence, and barriers to creating personal disaster plans; staff absenteeism estimates; barriers to work attendance. Quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and content analysis with identification and coding of common themes, respectively. RESULTS All 12 invited leaders participated and believed a personal disaster plan was important but only 2 had plans. None had ever discussed with their staff the importance of having a personal disaster plan. Two common barriers in creating a plan were low threat perception level and never considering the possibility of pandemic influenza. Only half of respondents could list common barriers preventing staff from working. Staff were confident employees would come to work during a disaster. CONCLUSION Outpatient primary care leaders may hold misconceptions regarding future disasters, underestimate their potential impact on clinics, and lack personal preparedness.

134104,Introduction.,2002,"Climate change is with us. As professionals who place value on evidence-based practice, climate change is something we cannot ignore. The current pandemic of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has demonstrated how global crises can arise suddenly and have a significant impact on public health. Global warming, a chronic process punctuated by acute episodes of extreme weather events, is an insidious global health crisis needing at least as much attention. Many neurological diseases are complex chronic conditions influenced at many levels by changes in the environment. This review aimed to collate and evaluate reports from clinical and basic science about the relationship between climate change and epilepsy. The keywords climate change, seasonal variation, temperature, humidity, thermoregulation, biorhythm, gene, circadian rhythm, heat, and weather were used to search the published evidence. A number of climatic variables are associated with increased seizure frequency in people with epilepsy. Climate change-induced increase in seizure precipitants such as fevers, stress, and sleep deprivation (e.g. as a result of more frequent extreme weather events) or vector-borne infections may trigger or exacerbate seizures, lead to deterioration of seizure control, and affect neurological, cerebrovascular, or cardiovascular comorbidities and risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. Risks are likely to be modified by many factors, ranging from individual genetic variation and temperature-dependent channel function, to housing quality and global supply chains. According to the results of the limited number of experimental studies with animal models of seizures or epilepsy, different seizure types appear to have distinct susceptibility to seasonal influences. Increased body temperature, whether in the context of fever or not, has a critical role in seizure threshold and seizure-related brain damage. Links between climate change and epilepsy are likely to be multifactorial, complex, and often indirect, which makes predictions difficult. We need more data on possible climate-driven altered risks for seizures, epilepsy, and epileptogenesis, to identify underlying mechanisms at systems, cellular, and molecular levels for better understanding of the impact of climate change on epilepsy. Further focussed data would help us to develop evidence for mitigation methods to do more to protect people with epilepsy from the effects of climate change.","Gulcebi, Medine I; Bartolini, Emanuele; Lee, Omay; Lisgaras, Christos Panagiotis; Onat, Filiz; Mifsud, Janet; Striano, Pasquale; Vezzani, Annamaria; Hildebrand, Michael S; Jimenez-Jimenez, Diego; Junck, Larry; Lewis-Smith, David; Scheffer, Ingrid E; Thijs, Roland D; Zuberi, Sameer M; Blenkinsop, Stephen; Fowler, Hayley J; Foley, Aideen; Sisodiya, Sanjay M",Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.107791; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33578223/,394

Unfortunately, few data for regions are available. OBJECTIVES This study aimed to describe the characteristics and independent risk factors associated with COVID-19 mortality in Castilla-La Mancha, Spain. METHODS Cohort and multicenter study in all 14 public hospitals of the Castilla-La Mancha Health Service. Baseline characteristics, preexisting comorbidities, symptoms, clinical features and treatments were included. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with death and Kaplan-Meier test to examine survival probability. Statistical significance was considered with p<0.05 (95% CI). SPSS (version 24.0 for Windows) and R 4.0.2 (R Statistics) software were used. RESULTS The cohort comprised 12,126 patients sequentially attended between February 11 and May 11, 2020. The mean age of patients was 66.4 years; 5667 (46.7%) were women. Six protective factors against exitus were defined: female sex, anosmia, cough, chloroquine and azithromycin. The risk factors were: age over 50, obesity, cardiac pathology, fever, dyspnea, lung infiltrates, lymphopenia, D-dimer above 1000ng/mL, and mechanical ventilation requirement. Survival analysis showed higher survival rate in women (75.7%) than men (72.1%). Cumulative survival was 87.5% for non-hospitalized patients, 70.2% for patients admitted to hospital and 61.2% in ICU patients. Additionally, survival probability decreased with increasing age range. CONCLUSION Determination of protective or death-promoting factors could be useful to stratify patients by severity criteria and to improve COVID-19 care management.","Muñoz-Rodríguez, José Ramón; Gómez-Romero, Francisco Javier; Pérez-Ortiz, José Manuel; López-Juárez, Pilar; Santiago, Juan Luis; Serrano-Oviedo, Leticia; Redondo-Calvo, Francisco Javier",Archivos de bronconeumologia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arbres.2021.02.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33785236/,394

METHODS A 3D bioacoustic-thermal model using the finite element method was implemented to assess multiple applicator implant configurations for thermal ablation with interstitial ultrasound energy. Interstitial applicators consist of linear arrays of up to four 10 mm-long tubular ultrasound transducers, each under separate and dynamic power control, enclosed within a water-cooled delivery catheter (2.4 mm OD). The authors considered parallel implants with two and three applicators (clustered configuration), spaced 2-3 cm apart, to simulate open surgical placement. In addition, the authors considered two applicator implants with applicators converging and diverging at angles of ∼20°, 30°, and 45° to simulate percutaneous placement. Heating experiments (10-15 min) were performed and compared against simulations employing the same experimental parameters. To estimate the performance of parallel, multiple applicator configurations in an in vivo setting, simulations were performed taking into account a range of blood perfusion levels (0, 5, 12, and 15 kg m(-3) s(-1)) that may occur in tumors of varying vascularity. The impact of tailoring the power supplied to individual transducer elements along the length of applicators is explored for applicators inserted in non-parallel (converging and diverging) configurations. Thermal dose (t(43) > 240 min) and temperature thresholds (T > 52 °C) were used to define the ablation zones, with dynamic changes to tissue acoustic and thermal properties incorporated within the model. RESULTS Experiments in ex vivo bovine liver yielded ablation zones ranging between 4.0-5.6 cm × 3.2-4.9 cm, in cross section. Ablation zone dimensions predicted by simulations with similar parameters to the experiments were in close agreement (within 5 mm). Simulations of in vivo heating showed that 15 min heating and interapplicator spacing less than 3 cm are required to obtain contiguous, complete ablation zones. The ability to create complete ablation zone profiles for nonparallel implants was illustrated by tailoring applied power levels along the length of applicators. CONCLUSIONS Parallel implants consisting of three interstitial ultrasound applicators in a triangular configuration yield complete ablation zones measuring up to 6.2 cm × 5.7 cm after 15 min heating. At larger interapplicator spacing, the level of blood perfusion in the tumor may yield indentations along the periphery of the ablation zone. Tailoring applied power along the length of the applicator can accommodate for nonparallel implants, without compromising safety.","Prakash, Punit; Salgaonkar, Vasant A; Clif Burdette, E; Diederich, Chris J",Medical physics,https://doi.org/10.1118/1.4765459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23231283/,394

Lung lacerations derived from fractures of the ribs are usually found in these patients. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is usually used as a routine procedure in the treatment of retained pleural collections. The objective of this study was to find out if there is any advantage in adding the procedure for repairing lacerated lungs during VATS. METHODS Patients who were brought to our hospital with blunt chest trauma were enrolled into this prospective cohort study from January 2004 to December 2011. All enrolled patients had rib fractures with type III lung lacerations diagnosed by CT scans. They sustained retained pleural collections and surgical drainage was indicated. On one group, only evacuation procedure by VATS was performed. On the other group, not only evacuations but also repair of lung injuries were performed. Patients with penetrating injury or blunt injury with massive bleeding, that required emergency thoracotomy, were excluded from the study, in addition to those with cardiovascular or oesophageal injuries. RESULTS During the study period, 88 patients who underwent thoracoscopy were enrolled. Among them, 43 patients undergoing the simple thoracoscopic evacuation method were stratified into Group 1. The remaining 45 patients who underwent thoracoscopic evacuation combined with resection of lung lacerations were stratified into Group 2. The rates of post-traumatic infection were higher in Group 1. The durations of chest-tube drainage and ventilator usage were shorter in Group 2, as were the lengths of patient intensive care unit stay and hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS When compared with simple thoracoscopic evacuation methods, repair and resection of the injured lungs combined may result in better clinical outcomes in patients who sustained blunt chest injuries.","Chou, Yi-Pin; Kuo, Liang-Chi; Soo, Kwan-Ming; Tarng, Yih-Wen; Chiang, Hsin-I; Huang, Fong-Dee; Lin, Hsing-Lin",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/ejcts/ezt523; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24242850/,394

It is a biomarker for Leydig cell functional capacity, which is a measure of the numbers and differentiation status of these steroidogenic cells and lacks the biological and technical variance of the steroid testosterone. This retrospective study was carried out to examine the relationship between seminal parameters and the Leydig cell compartment, and secondarily to assess other factors responsible for determining Leydig cell functional capacity. METHODS INSL3 was assessed together with seminal, anthropometric, and hormonal parameters in a Swedish cohort of 18-year-old men, representing the average population, and in a smaller, more heterogeneous cohort of men visiting an Australian infertility clinic. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Average INSL3 concentration at 18 years is greater than that reported at younger or older agesr and indicated a large 10-fold variation. In neither cohort was there a relationship between INSL3 concentration and any semen parameter. For the larger, more uniform Swedish cohort of young men, there was a significant negative relationship between INSL3 and BMI, supporting the idea that adult Leydig cell functional capacity may be established during puberty. In both cohorts there was a significant relationship between INSL3 and FSH, but not LH concentration. No relationship was found between INSL3 and androgen receptor trinucleotide repeat polymorphisms, reinforcing the notion that Leydig cell functional capacity is unlikely to be determined by androgen influence alone. Nor did INSL3 correlate with the T/LH ratio, an alternative measure of Leydig cell functional capacity, supporting the view that these are independent measures of Leydig cell function.","Anand-Ivell, Ravinder; Tremellen, Kelton; Soyama, Hiroaki; Enki, Doyo; Ivell, Richard",Andrology,https://doi.org/10.1111/andr.13001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33715296/,394

MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with Child-Pugh score less than 8 were eligible. A total of 32 lesions in 26 patients were treated with SBRT. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed. Toxicities were graded by CTCAEv4 criteria and response was scored by EASL guidelines. RESULTS Median prescribed dose was 55Gy (range 40-55Gy) delivered in 5 fractions. Mean tumor diameter was 5.0cm and mean GTV was 107cc. Median follow-up was 8.8months with a median survival of 11.1months, and one-year overall survival was 45%. Overall response rate was 42% and one-year local control was 91%. Nine patients experienced a decline in Child-Pugh class following treatment, and two grade 5 hepatic failure toxicities occurred during study follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Primary hepatic malignancies not amenable to surgical resection portend a poor prognosis, despite available treatment options.

Although several computational predictors have been proposed, their detection performance is still limited. In this study, we treat protein remote homology detection as a document retrieval task, where the proteins are considered as documents and its aim is to find the highly related documents with the query documents in a database. A protein similarity network was constructed based on the true labels of proteins in the database, and the query proteins were then connected into the network based on the similarity scores calculated by three ranking methods, including PSI-BLAST, Hmmer and HHblits. The PageRank algorithm and Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) algorithm were respectively performed on this network to move the homologous proteins of query proteins to the neighbors of the query proteins in the network. Finally, PageRank and HITS algorithms were combined, and a predictor called HITS-PR-HHblits was proposed to further improve the predictive performance. Tested on the SCOP and SCOPe benchmark datasets, the experimental results showed that the proposed protocols outperformed other state-of-the-art methods.

146770,"Machine Learning Approaches to Retrieve High-Quality, Clinically Relevant Evidence From the Biomedical Literature: Systematic Review.",2021-09-09,"Aims Pooling the effect sizes of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from continuous outcomes, such as glycated hemoglobin level (HbA1c), is an important method in evidence syntheses. However, due to challenges related to baseline imbalances and pre/post correlations, simple analysis of change scores (SACS) and simple analysis of final values (SAFV) meta-analyses result in under- or overestimation of effect estimates. This study was aimed to compare pooled effect sizes estimated by Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), SACS, and SAFV meta-analyses, using the example of RCTs of digital interventions with HbA1c as the main outcome. Materials and methods Three databases were systematically searched for RCTs published from 1993 through June 2017. Two reviewers independently assessed titles and abstracts using predefined eligibility criteria, assessed study quality, and extracted data, with disagreements resolved by arbitration from a third reviewer. Results ANCOVA, SACS, and SAFV resulted in pooled HbA1c mean differences of -0.39% (95% CI: [-0.51, -0.26]), -0.39% (95% CI: [-0.51, -0.26]), and -0.34% (95% CI: [-0.48-0.19]), respectively. Removing studies with both high baseline imbalance (≥±0.2%) and pre/post correlation of ≥±0.6 resulted in a mean difference of -0.39% (95% CI: [-0.53, -0.26]), -0.40% (95% CI: [-0.54, -0.26]), and -0.33% (95% CI: [-0.48, -0.18]) with ANCOVA, SACS, and SAFV meta-analyses, respectively. Substantial heterogeneity was noted. Egger's test for funnel plot symmetry did not indicate evidence of publication bias for all methods. Conclusion By all meta-analytic methods, digital interventions appear effective in reducing HbA1c in type 2 diabetes. The effort to adjust for baseline imbalance and pre/post correlation using ANCOVA relies on the level of detail reported from individual studies. Reporting detailed summary data and, ideally, access to individual patient data of intervention trials are essential.","Kebede, Mihiretu M; Peters, Manuela; Heise, Thomas L; Pischke, Claudia R","Diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity : targets and therapy",https://doi.org/10.2147/dmso.s180106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30588055/,394
147591,Systematic review on effects of bioenergy from edible versus inedible feedstocks on food security.,2021-05-04,"INTRODUCTION In Neuro Intensive Care Units (NICU) and neurosurgical units, patients with an external ventricular drain (EVD) due to hydrocephalus following aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) are commonly seen. Cessation of the EVD involves the dilemma of either closing the EVD directly, or gradually weaning it before removal. Development of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and acute hydrocephalus with subsequent need of a permanent shunt has been associated with prompt closure of theEVD, whereas increased risk of infection with possible spreading to the brain and subsequent patient fatality is suspected in connection to a longer treatment as seen in gradual weaning. Sparse data exist on the recommendation of cessation strategy and patients are currently being treated on the basis of personal experience and expert opinion. The objective of this systematic review is to assess the available evidence from clinical trials on the effects of prompt closure versus gradual weaning of EVD treatment for hydrocephalus in adult patients with SAH. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will search for randomised clinical trials in major international databases. Two authors will independently screen and select references for inclusion, extract data and assess the methodological quality of the included randomised clinical trials using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Any disagreement will be resolved by consensus. We will analyse the extracted data using Review Manager and trial sequential analysis. To assess the quality of the evidence, we will create a 'Summary of Findings' table containing our primary and secondary outcomes using the GRADE assessment.

Whilst these approaches have seen both commercial and clinical success, uptake of these robots remains moderate because of their high cost, large physical footprint and long setup times. More recently, researchers have moved toward developing hand-held robots that are completely ungrounded and manipulated by surgeons in free space, in a similar manner to how conventional instruments are handled. These devices provide specific functions that assist the surgeon in accomplishing tasks that are otherwise challenging with manual manipulation. Hand-held robots have the advantages of being compact and easily integrated into the normal surgical workflow since there is typically little or no setup time. Hand-held devices can also have a significantly reduced cost to healthcare providers as they do not necessitate the complex, multi degree-of-freedom linkages that grounded robots require. However, the development of such devices is faced with many technical challenges, including miniaturization, cost and sterility, control stability, inertial and gravity compensation and robust instrument tracking. This review presents the emerging technical trends in hand-held medical robots and future development opportunities for promoting their wider clinical uptake.","Payne, Christopher J; Yang, Guang-Zhong",Annals of biomedical engineering,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10439-014-1042-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24927713/,394

METHODS Two hundred consecutive patients (mean age 60.9 years, range 33-86; 128 women) with chronic venous disease underwent saphenous or perforator vein ablation in 268 limbs (305 venous trunks) guided by adjunctive venography and fluoroscopy in addition to ultrasound between October 2010 and May 2016. Intraprocedural venograms were independently evaluated by 2 vascular specialists to identify the presence of venous anomalies and the need for fluoroscopy-guided maneuvers to successfully complete venous ablation. Intraprocedural venography results were compared with preoperative venous duplex scan reports to ascertain if the duplex study could be of value in identifying preoperatively any anatomical variants that may pose a technical challenge to the operator. RESULTS In this cohort, 542 venograms (2.0/limb) were performed with a mean duration of 4.9±9.1 minutes (range 1-48). Two thirds of patients (132, 66%) had anomalies or abnormalities within the target vein; more than a third (88, 44%) required an endovascular maneuver to successfully complete the ablation and 17% (34) of cases were impossible to complete without adjunctive fluoroscopic guidance. Per-patient comparison of intraprocedural venography with preoperative venous duplex reports identified 21 (11%) patients with abnormalities detected on ultrasound (23 anomalies) compared with 123 (64%) on venography (193 anomalies). This gave ultrasound a 17.1% sensitivity, 100% specificity and positive predictive value, and 40.7% negative predictive value. CONCLUSION Venography is a valuable addition to ultrasound to facilitate complete ablation of insufficient saphenous veins in selected patients with complex anatomy.","Varcoe, Ramon L; Thomas, Shannon D; Bourke, Victor; Rübesamen, Nicole M K; Lennox, Andrew F",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1177/1526602816686734; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28056580/,394

The number of patients requiring hospital admission and intensive care may overwhelm health systems and negatively affect standard care for patients presenting with conditions needing emergency interventions. This position statements aims to assist cardiologists in the invasive management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. To that end, we assembled a panel of interventional cardiologists and acute cardiac care specialists appointed by the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI) and from the Acute Cardiovascular Care Association (ACVC) and included the experience from the first and worst affected areas in Europe. Modified diagnostic and treatment algorithms are proposed to adapt evidence-based protocols for this unprecedented challenge. Various clinical scenarios, as well as management algorithms for patients with a diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 infection, presenting with ST- and non-ST-segment elevation ACS are described. In addition, we address the need for re-organization of ACS networks, with redistribution of hub and spoke hospitals, as well as for in-hospital reorganization of emergency rooms and cardiac units, with examples coming from multiple European countries.

In particular, there is little information about the surgical aspects of ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC) for children. In the present study, the appropriateness of preoperative management and the criteria of our cases were investigated with the aim of establishing a safe OTC procedure. METHODS A total of 25 girls who underwent OTC from November 2015 through May 2020 were retrospectively analyzed with IRB approval. RESULTS The median age of the patients was 13 (1-17) years. The medical indications were varied (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma, brain tumor), and included rare diseases. Seventeen cases (68%) underwent OTC during chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and 21 (84%) had comorbidities. All cases underwent ovarian tissue retrieval (OTR) with laparoscopy, and the median operating time was 64 (36-97) min, with little bleeding. Although two had complications, all patients started treatment on schedule. The median WBC and CRP increases a day after OTR were 0 (- 4400 to + 5200)/µl and 0.21 (- 0.2 to 0.87) mg/dl, respectively, with no complications. CONCLUSION As long as the preoperative criteria are met, OTC could be possible even for children with a severe blood condition. In such cases, the degrees of the WBC and CRP elevations are useful to assess surgical infection.","Takae, Seido; Furuta, Shigeyuki; Keino, Dai; Shiraishi, Eriko; Iwahata, Yuriko; Oyama, Kei; Iwahata, Hideyuki; Nishiya, Yuri; Kawaguchi, Kohei; Obayashi, Juma; Tanaka, Kunihide; Sawada, Shino; Suzuki, Yuki; Sugishita, Yodo; Deura, Imari; Horage, Yuki; Nagae, Hideki; Kondo, Haruhiro; Sakamoto, Miki; Mori, Tetsuya; Kitagawa, Hiroaki; Suzuki, Nao",Pediatric surgery international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00383-021-04900-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33855613/,394

Our study was designed to evaluate the feasibility of performing small bowel resection by transcolonic NOTES(®) and transabdominal approach using rigid laparoscopic and flexible endoscopic instruments. METHODS One non survival and four survival experiments were performed using a porcine model. The endoscope with an overtube was advanced into the peritoneal cavity through the colotomy. Mini-laparoscopic instruments were placed through the abdominal wall under the endoscopic observation. The endoscope was replaced with a rigid linear stapler. The small bowel was identified. The segment of the small bowel was resected by firing the endo stapler, and extracted through the colon. The two limbs of the small bowel were approximated with two stay-sutures. An enterotomy was then created on the antimesenteric sides of each line. A side-to-side anastomosis was performed with another application of the endo stapler. The stapler was withdrawn. The enterotomy was closed by suturing. The colotomy was closed with endoclips and the endoscope was withdrawn. The mini-laparoscopic instruments were removed. RESULTS Small bowel resection was successfully performed in all animals. The surgery time was 70 minutes. There was no mortality or complications. The animals recovered uneventfully, and survived the 2 weeks postprocedure period. They remained healthy, and gained weight. Necropsy was performed 2 weeks after the surgery. On necropsy, evaluation of the abdominal skin revealed no scars. The peritoneal cavity was examined. No signs of infection, bleeding, perforations, and adhesions were noted. Endoscopic examination of the colotomy and anastomosis revealed complete healing that was confirmed by histopathology. CONCLUSIONS The study has demonstrated the feasibility of small bowel resection using transcolonic NOTES(®) and transabdominal approach. Simultaneous use of flexible endoscopic and rigid laparoscopic instruments in NOTES(®) is not only feasible but has significant advantages and greatly facilitates the performance of the operation, yet leaves no scars.","Dubcenco, Elena; Grantcharov, Teodor; Eng, Frank C S; Streutker, Catherine J; Baxter, Nancy N; Rotstein, Ori D; Baker, Jeffrey P",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1156-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20927551/,394

In addition, donation rates for DCDs are typically lower than for DBDs. Although there has been a great deal of research on how the concerns of DBD families impact donation, limited research exists on family concerns and decision-making in the DCD request process. OBJECTIVE To determine the concerns of families approached for DCD and explore how those might be addressed to increase DCD donation rates. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Written request response forms were completed by organ procurement and family services coordinators from 4 organ procurement organizations in 4 different states. They were filled out as soon as possible after speaking with families about DCD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Responses were marked on a 12-item instrument, and anecdotal observations and detailed comments about family concerns, donor registration status, and decisions made were noted. RESULTS Family concerns that block DCDs differ in many ways from those that block DBDs. These concerns arise from stresses peculiar to the DCD situation and must be addressed for these types of donations to increase. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The purposes of the study are to identify family concerns about donating organs that are specific to DCD and that may differ from DBD and to distinguish how those concerns might be addressed in ways that increase the likelihood of donation.","Verble, Margaret; Worth, Judy; Gulli, Loreen; Dunn, Sue; Parravano-Drummond, Amy; Fleming, Chelsea; McClung, Sue; Garrison, Wendy",Transplantation proceedings,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2020.08.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33004222/,394

162734,The Coronavirus as a Revenge Effect: The Pandemic from the Perspective of Philosophy of Technique,2021,"INTRODUCTION Adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery carries the risk of spinal cord injury. Spinal cord ischemia is often implicated in the pathogenesis but has not been directly investigated. Here we present our index case as a proof of concept for a study evaluating the role of spinal cord perfusion (SCP) changes in ASD correction. METHODS ASD surgery was performed in the usual fashion with the addition of 1) SCP monitoring, using laser Doppler probe fixated to the dura at the level of the pedicle subtraction osteotomy (PSO) and 2) intrathecal pressure monitoring, using a lumbar drain. Somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) and motor evoked potential (MEP) were monitored throughout the case. RESULTS An 84-year-old male with kyphoscoliosis and progressive myelopathy causing diminished motor and sensory function was treated with T4 PSO and long segment reconstruction. At baseline, SSEP signals were detectable in all 4 extremities, MEP signals were present in the right foot only, intrathecal pressure was 4 mm Hg, and mean SCP was 21.2 perfusion units. The osteotomy was performed and reduced in 2 steps. After the first step of reduction, MEP signals appeared in the left leg and increased in amplitude in the right leg, and SCP simultaneously increased to 205.6. Further reduction led to MEP signal loss in both legs and decrease in SCP to 39.2. With partial reversal of the reduction, MEP signals returned in both legs and SCP improved to 76.0. Final reduction maneuvers were then performed in a delayed fashion before closure, with stable MEP signals and a final SCP of 42.9. SSEP signals, vital signs, and intrathecal pressure were stable throughout the case. Postoperatively the patient was neurologically stable. CONCLUSIONS The present case provides the first direct evidence that fluctuations in SCP may contribute to neurologic changes during ASD surgery. Further investigation is under way to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms, with the ultimate goal of developing targeted strategies for spinal cord protection during these high-risk cases.","Turner, Jay D; Eastlack, Robert K; Mirzadeh, Zaman; Nguyen, Stacie; Pawelek, Jeff; Mundis, Gregory M",World neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2015.08.067; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26361322/,394

162968,The Limits of EUropean Legitimacy: On Populism and Technocracy. Introduction to the Special Issue,2021,"The 3C-like main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (3CL(Pro)) is responsible for the cleavage of the viral polyprotein. This process is essential for the viral life cycle. Therefore, 3CL(Pro) is a promising target to develop antiviral drugs for COVID-19 prevention and treatment. Traditional enzymatic assays for the identification of 3CL(Pro) inhibitors rely on peptide-based colorimetric or fluorogenic substrates. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has limit or delay access to these substrates, especially for researchers in developing countries attempting to screen natural product libraries. We explored the use of the fluorescent probe 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate (ANS) as an alternative assay for inhibitor identification. Fluorescence enhancement upon binding of ANS to 3CL(Pro) was observed, and this interaction was competitive with a peptide substrate. The utility of ANS-based competitive binding assay to identify 3CL(Pro) inhibitors was demonstrated with the flavonoid natural products baicalein and rutin. The molecular nature of ANS and rutin interaction with 3CL(Pro) was explored with molecular modeling. Our results suggested that ANS could be employed in a competitive binding assay to facilitate the identification of novel SARS-CoV-2 antiviral compounds. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

Arguments about the gradual decline of the role of the state in the organization of the management of socio-economic processes against the background of the strengthening of civil society institutions also lost their significance, as only the state was able to organize a centralized mobilization of resources to counter the mass threat to public health. These questions lead to a revision of the traditional axiology of Western society, based on the primacy of individualism and the atomization of society - approaches that the Roman Catholic Church has traditionally opposed, which in its doctrine is based on the concept of the common good. As the world's largest confession, Catholicism retains its influence over a wide range of people in many of the leading countries of the modern West. The church's social doctrine is traditionally perceived, both by Catholics themselves and by various associations of citizens, as an ethical basis for organizing the life of society. The paper analyzes the development of the social doctrine of the Catholic Church after the outbreak of the pandemic in the context of both its perception of the coronavirus itself and the necessary measures to combat it and its position on the post-ovoid structure of the world. The Papal encyclicals, messages, and speeches, which reflect the official position of the Vatican, are of crucial importance. As a possible way to overcome the crisis, the Vatican offers the classic principles for the social teaching of the Catholic Church-solidarity and subsidiarity, which require, on the one hand, the subjectivity of society and the decentralization of power.","Sardaryan, G.

This research has elicited evidence for increasing numbers of anxiety, depression, and overall impaired mental well-being. But, the global COVID-19 pandemic has also created new opportunities for research into quantifying human emotions: remotely, contactless, in everyday life. The ubiquitous computing community has long been at the forefront of developing, testing, and building user-facing systems that aim at quantifying human emotion. However, rather than aiming at more accurate sensing algorithms, it is time to critically evaluate whether it is actually possible and in what ways it could be beneficial for technologies to be able to detect user emotions. In this workshop, we bring together experts from the fields of Ubiquitous Computing, Human-Computer Interaction, and Psychology to-long-overdue-merge their expertise and ask the fundamental questions: how do we make sense of emotion-sensing, can and should we quantify human emotions? © 2021 ACM.","Tag, B.; Webber, S.; Wadley, G.; Bartlett, V.; Goncalves, J.; Koval, P.; Slovak, P.; Smith, W.; Hollenstein, T.; Cox, A.

Drawing on these ancestors, a growing body of scholars has articulated psychoanalytic perspectives on race, class, sexuality, and gender in the consulting room and in society. These diverse authors-Black, White, and Brown-represent a ""decolonial turn"" in psychoanalysis that has yet to claim a primary ancestor, ambivalently inhabiting Freudian, Relational, and Lacanian theories as a ""secure base."" In a world under siege by anti-Blackness and COVID-19-pandemics restricting the capacity to breathe for indigenous, immigrant, poor, and Black people-a global voice roars through masks that Black Lives Matter. Trapped between thin blue lines, overlapping pandemics, and the limitations of institute and graduate school training, this article is an outburst claiming Frantz Fanon, the revolutionary Black psychiatrist, as ancestor to this movement. Inspired by Edward Said's insight that Fanon is Freud's ""most disputatious heir,"" I will review his thinking as a decolonial psychoanalytic theorist through his classic works and his translated clinical papers. Tracing his psychoanalytic-specifically Lacanian and Ferenczian-influences, I will argue for Fanon's inclusion within the psychoanalytic canon and curriculum, and outline how his contributions are foundational to the decolonial turn. More urgently, I want to draw on Fanon to ask the following question: Do Black Lives Matter in psychoanalysis?

164593,Guest editorial,2021,"Background: Several reports have shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may trigger a vigorous immune response that could lead to the appearance of various autoantibodies such as antinuclear antibodies, antiphospholipid antibodies or anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, among others. Moreover, the pulmonary involvement in SARSCoV-2 may resemble that of patients with anti-MDA5 positive syndrome or acute form of antisynthetase syndrome. Objectives: Our aim was to analyse the presence of anti-MDA5 and other myositis-specific autoantibodies such as the antisynthetase antibodies in patients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Retrospective observational study performed in a tertiary care center. We included 28 patients admitted to the intensive care unit with severe acute respiratory syndrome, 14 at the onset of the disease (group A) and 14 after 30 days of being treated in an intensive care unit (group B). Chest CT was performed at the admission. We analyzed the presence of anti-MDA5 and antisynthetase antibodies by immunoblot (Euroimmune®) and in those who were positive we performed a confirmatory test by immunoprecipitation. Results: All chest CT showed bilateral ground glass pattern. Three out of 14 patients of group A (12 males, 86%, mean ± SD age 67.1 ± 12.2) were positive for antisynthetase antibodies (2 anti-PL7, 1 anti-Jo1), and 6 out of 14 patients of the group B (6 males, 48%, mean ± SD age 68.7 ± 8.1) were positive to antisynthetase antibodies (2 anti-PL7, 2 anti-PL-12, 1 anti-EJ, 1 anti-OJ+PL7). Immunoblots also show positivity for other myositis-specific or associated antibodies, such as anti-TIF1g, anti-PM75, anti-SAE and anti-SRP. All of these results found by immunoblotting were negative by immunoprecipitation. None of the 28 patients were positive for anti-MDA5 antibodies. Conclusion: Severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is characterized by ground glass pattern in chest CT, as it is found in anti-MDA5 or antisynthetase syndrome. The positivity of several myositis related autoantibodies showed in immunoblot appears to be more related to the vigorous immune response producing polyclonal immunoglobulins than triggering a real myositis-associated interstitial lung disease. Clinicians must be aware about these false positive results in patients with severe COVID-19 acute respiratory syndrome.","Gil-Vila, A.; Perurena-Prieto, J.; Nolla-Fontana, C.; Orozco-Galvez, O.; Miarons-Font, M.; Guillén del Castillo, A.; Pacheco-Reyes, A.; Trallero-Araguás, E.; Hernandez-Gonzalez, M.; Selva-O'callaghan, A.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.3019,394

Recent direct detection assays based on CRISPR-Cas13a avoid reverse transcription and DNA amplification required of gold-standard PCR assays, but these assays have not yet achieved the sensitivity of PCR and are not easily multiplexed to detect multiple viruses or variants. Here we show that Cas13a acting on single target RNAs loaded into droplets exhibits stochastic nuclease activity that can be used to enable sensitive, rapid, and multiplexed virus quantification. Using SARS-CoV-2 RNA as the target and combinations of CRISPR RNA (crRNA) that recognize different parts of the viral genome, we demonstrate that reactions confined to small volumes can rapidly achieve PCR-level sensitivity. By tracking nuclease activity within individual droplets over time, we find that Cas13a exhibits rich kinetic behavior that depends on both the target RNA and crRNA. We demonstrate that these kinetic signatures can be harnessed to differentiate between different human coronavirus species as well as SARS-CoV-2 variants within a single droplet. The combination of high sensitivity, short reaction times, and multiplexing makes this droplet-based Cas13a assay with kinetic barcoding a promising strategy for direct RNA identification and quantification.","Son, S.; Lyden, A.; Shu, J.; Stephens, S.

It has also disturbed economy, environment and social norms leading to many problems and giving birth to different rules and laws in order to ensure public safety. Wearing masks is one of the most important and primitive precautionary measures along with safe social distancing as advised by the World Health Organization. To manually monitor people not wearing face mask in order to ensure public safety is definitely a strenuous task. Therefore, this research work proposes a real time face mask detection system by applying computer vision and machine learning concepts like convolution neural networks and refined MobileNetV2 architecture to ease the deployment of proposed model in embedded devices with limited computational capacity. The dataset utilized here is available on Kaggle as Face mask detection dataset. The model is trained using Adam Optimizer algorithm which is best suited for deep learning models and is built using Keras, TensorFlow and OpenCV. The proposed model touches 99% accuracy under various training to testing ratios like 70% training and 30% testing, 50% training and 50% testing etc. Precision, recall, f-score and support are calculated for all trials. This means that the system is computationally effective and could potentially be used in places like railway stations, airports or any other public places to detect people not wearing face mask and ensure safety to certain extent during this pandemic times. © 2021 IEEE.","Rashmi Nayak, S.; Manohar, N.","6th IEEE International Conference on Communication and Electronics Systems, ICCES 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/icces51350.2021.9489098,394

This paper presents an experience of a CS0 remote workshop, planned and led by peers, with the goal of teaching introductory programming in Python to first-year Computer Engineering undergraduates. The workshop happened during the Covid-19 pandemic and took advantage of calendar postponements to offer a 12-week remote experience. From the data collected, we perceived high student motivation, medium to high engagement and medium self-regulation both in general and in programming issues. Analysis of the experience suggests that, after the workshop, students have positive perceptions of their own non-cognitive issues, in addition to feeling prepared to learn programming in the CS1 course. Peer learning allowed novice students to reduce barriers to learning, and to feel closer to their field of knowledge. To the senior students who led the workshop, it allowed them to mediate the learning process, to collectively build knowledge, and to learn while teaching. © 2021 IEEE.","Pereira, F. T. S.

However, as COVID-19 has been effectively controlled in China, remote office services provided by enterprise social networks (ESNs) is no longer a necessary choice of users. There has not yet been any referen-tial research for ESN enterprises concerning how to encourage users willing to use ESNs continu-ously. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to identify the critical factors of ESN continuous usage intention to make up the research gap of ESN continuous usage intention and to help enterprises address the issue of sustained growth. This research combines elements of the task technology fit (TTF) model and D&M information systems success (ISS) model, explaining the continuous usage intention of ESN users. The empirical analysis results are based on the sample data of 668 Chinese respondents with experience in ESNs use and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). Results show that task technology fit, performance expectancy and the satisfaction degree have a significant influence on continuous usage intention of ESNs. The research findings can provide the theoretical basis for sustained development and follow-up research of the ESN industry. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Wu, R.

However, the rapid spread of insecticide resistance threatens our ability to control mosquito vectors. Larvae of Aedes aegypti (New Orleans strain) were screened with the Medicines for Malaria Venture Pandemic Response Box, an open-source compound library, using INVAPP, an invertebrate automated phenotyping platform suited to high-throughput chemical screening of larval motility. Of the 400 compounds screened, we identified rubitecan (a synthetic derivative of camptothecin) as a hit compound that significantly reduced Ae. aegypti larval motility compared to DMSO controls. Both rubitecan and camptothecin displayed concentration dependent reduction in larval motility with estimated EC50s of 25.5 ± 5.0 μM and 22.3 ± 5.4 μM respectively. We extended our investigation to adult mosquitoes and found that camptothecin increased lethality when delivered in a blood meal to Ae. aegypti adults at 100 μM and 10 μM and completely blocked egg laying when fed at 100 μM. Camptothecin and its derivatives, inhibitors of topoisomerase I, have known activity against several agricultural pests and are also approved for the treatment of several cancers. Crucially, they can inhibit Zika virus replication in human cells, so there is potential for dual targeting of both the vector and an important arbovirus that it carries. Both humans and mosquitoes express the highly conserved topoisomerase I target, however, the design of derivatives with differing pharmacokinetic properties may offer a promising route towards the development of insect-specificity of this chemistry.","Partridge, Frederick A.; Poulton, Beth C.; Lake, Milly A.I.; Lees, Rebecca A.; Mann, Harry-Jack; Lycett, Gareth J.; Sattelle, David B",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.06.458863,394

Politics, the Public, and Criminological Expertise",2021,"The paper is motivated by the urgent need, imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, for trustworthy access to secure communication systems with the highest achievable availability and minimum latency. In this regard, we focus on an ultra-dense wireless network consisting of Femto Access Points (FAPs) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), known as caching nodes, where there are more than one possible caching node to handle user's request. To efficiently cope with the dynamic topology of wireless networks and time-varying behavior of ground users, our focus is to develop an efficient connection scheduling framework, where ground users are autonomously trained to determine the optimal caching node, i.e., UAV or FAP. Our aim is to minimize users' access delay by maintaining a trade-off between the energy consumption of UAVs and the occurrence of handovers. To achieve these objectives, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem and propose the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Q-Network-based Connection Scheduling (CQN-CS) framework. More specifically, to solve the constructed multi-objective connection scheduling problem, a deep Q-Network model is developed as an efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to train ground users to handle their requests in an optimal and trustworthy fashion within the coupled UAV-based femtocaching network. The effectiveness of the proposed CQN-CS framework is evaluated in terms of the cache-hit ratio, user's access delay, energy consumption of UAVs, handover, lifetime of the network, and cumulative rewards. Based on the simulation results, the proposed CQN-CS framework illustrates significant performance improvements in companion to Q-learning and Deep Q-Network (DQN) schemes across all the aforementioned aspects. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

First, we find that in high income countries, higher levels of democracy reduce the spread of COVID-19 while in the low income countries its influence is exactly the opposite. Second, we find clear evidence that three dimensions of culture (individualism versus collectivism, uncertainty avoidance and masculinity versus femininity) influence people's behaviour in relation with the spread of COVID-19 in a large manner. This study's addressability is wide, from regular people to top policymakers, through their common goal of limiting this pandemic and all the negative effects it brings along.

Signed-up to be hyper-mobile Ph.D.-candidates, we became hyper-reflective pandemic intimates. We moved together into a space that felt safe, OUR safe space. Suspended. Did the pandemic open this door, or had this space always existed, even back in the old days? Probably the latter, although we were not sensitive enough to perceive it, too busy to push the door, too lonesome to CARE. Not attentive to its possibilities, not imaginative of its POWER, too confident to be capable of succeeding alone. Even if we might have secretly wished for this space to exist. The present piece of work, and JOY, might be described by others as a “side-step,” a “hobby project,” a “shadow activity.” For us, it is a recollection of shocks and wonders, a sentience of precious, ephemeral instances that last. We are a group of eight early career researchers who study global mobility and labor migration from a variety of disciplinary perspectives. With prior international mobility experience, we left our previous countries of residence in 2018 to join an EU-funded research project, whilst being located in different European cities. One could classify us, for example, as highly qualified, privileged migrants. The present paper is the outcome of a collaborative, auto-ethnographic study, conducted in 2020, in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, when we suddenly were forced not to travel anymore. We got together online every week to “refaire le monde,” and we conducted virtual, dialogical self-interrogations and group reflections. Based on an emic approach, in line with Chang et al. (2013), we applied an iterative process of data collection and analysis. Our weekly conversations naturally emerged as a safe space for exchange and understanding, as we were facing similar situations, despite staying at different places. Suddenly, as the privilege of “always being on the move,” “always socializing and networking” disappeared due to closed borders and pandemic threats, we experienced anxieties and isolation and had to re-evaluate our perceptions on life, work, and international mobility.

Spaceborne observations of atmospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs), including formaldehyde (HCHO), glyoxal (CHOCHO), and peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), reveal important changes over China in 2020, relative to 2019, in response to the pandemic-induced shutdown and the subsequent drop in pollutant emissions. In February, at the peak of the shutdown, the observed declines in OVOC levels were generally weaker (less than 20%) compared to the observed NO2 reductions (−40%). In May 2020, the observations reveal moderate decreases in NO2 (−15%) and PAN (−21%), small changes in CHOCHO (−3%) and HCHO (6%). Model simulations using the regional model MAGRITTEv1.1 with anthropogenic emissions accounting for the reductions due to the pandemic explain to a large extent the observed changes in lockdown-affected regions. The model results suggest that meteorological variability accounts for a minor but non-negligible part (~−5%) of the observed changes for NO2, whereas it is negligible for CHOCHO but plays a more substantial role for HCHO and PAN, especially in May. The interannual variability of biogenic and biomass burning emissions also contribute to the observed variations, explaining e.g., the important column increases of NO2 and OVOCs in February 2020, relative to 2019. These changes are well captured by the model simulations.","Stavrakou, Trissevgeni Müller Jean-François Bauwens Maite Doumbia Thierno Elguindi Nellie Darras Sabine Granier Claire Smedt Isabelle De Lerot Christophe Van Roozendael Michel Franco Bruno Clarisse Lieven Clerbaux Cathy Coheur Pierre-François Liu Yiming Wang Tao Shi Xiaoqin Gaubert Benjamin Tilmes Simone Brasseur Guy",Atmosphere,https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos12080946,394

This paper provides a simple but original statistical analysis of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stock market risk for 4 major IT companies of the world. Results revealed that while some businesses like personal computers from Microsoft, I phone handsets, sale of luxury and fashion goods at Amazon has declined during the pandemic, thus leading to fall of stocks. However, some prominent other segments like online shopping, cloud computing and streaming video from Amazon, oversees Office, Dynamics, Skype, LinkedIn Intelligent Cloud from Microsoft, Google’s ad sales during the crisis and issue of cheap bonds by Apple came out to be the winning corporate strategies to fight the negative economic effect of COVID-19 and to stabilize the situation of stocks in coming months. This study may help investors and companies to sustain the tide of economic fall. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Masih, J.; Rajasekaran, R.; Saini, N.; Kaur, D.","European, Asian, Middle Eastern, North African Conference on Management and Information Systems, EAMMIS 2021",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-77246-8_15,394

As developing economies have been firefighting the recent pandemic, the welfare of minors could be affected and children’s economic exploitation and abuse could increase. Therefore, the present research aims to shed light on and to investigate the association between child labour in developing countries and pandemics, including the coronavirus, through conducting a systematic literature review on previous empirical studies. The present research concludes that previous studies on non-COVID-19 pandemics have mainly focused on the African economies, while studies on the recent pandemic have focused on Asian countries. In addition, differences were observed in relation to the methodological approaches and the characteristics of minor employees and the protection services in certain countries have proven to be insufficient.

To reconstruct the development trend of COVID-19, we investigate the issue of the epidemic spreading process under vigorous non-pharmaceutical interventions. Here, an improved Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model with dynamic variables (i.e., health exposure individuals and close contacts) is proposed to predict the scale of COVID-19 and its dynamic evolution. We assume that the number of contacts and the reproduction number of COVID-19 changes dynamically over time. Then a gradient descent method is applied to estimate the effective reproduction number. We use the proposed model to reconstruct the dynamic transmission of COVID-19 in Chongqing between 14 January and 24 March 2020. The results show a similar development trend with a real-world epidemic. Our work has important implications when considering strategies for continuing surveillance and interventions to eventually contain outbreaks of COVID-19.","Yuan, X. H.; Chen, S. Y.; Lu, Y.

The experiment uses a miniature supermagnet rod as the pendulum oscillating element suspended from a fixed sewing thread. Its physics can be fully investigated, allowing to study the oscillation movements and to extract the gravity acceleration constant. The interaction with chemical substances can be accurately monitored by equilibrating the magnetic attraction of the probe as it opposes the gravity restoring force. Magnetic susceptibilities can be precisely measured in this way, allowing to access the number of unpaired electrons in the compounds, while stimulating discussions in the light of the ligand field theory. The simplicity and the opportunity of joining physics and chemistry are the most relevant aspects of the experiment. Curiously, the pendulum performance also implies a meditation like posture, requiring complete silence and confinement. In this sense it can also help relaxing our mind during the pandemics. © 2021 Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica. All rights reserved.","Toma, H.

Design: We analyzed four national surveys that assessed FI with the Brazilian Household Food Insecurity Measurement Scale (EBIA), and estimated the percentage changes of FS/FI levels between 2004 and 2013 (1st period) and between 2013 and 2018 (2nd period) by sociodemographic variables. Setting: Data from the cross-sectional Brazilian National Households Sample Surveys (2004, 2009 and 2013) and Household Budget Survey (2018). Participants: Nationally representative samples of household surveys (2004=112,530; 2009=120,910;2013=116,196; and 2018=57,920). Results: The 1st period was marked by a significant increase in FS (+18.9%) and by a reduction in severe FI (-53.6%). The 2nd period showed a decrease in FS (-18.2%) and an increase of severe FI (+43.8%). The greater increase FS in the 1st period was in the Northeast (+33.4%), among households with more than 7 residents (+40.8%), and in households were the reference person self-identified as black or mulatto (+27.6%). In the 2nd period, the lower increase in severe FI was observed among households with children under 4 years old (+ 6.3%) and with members over 65 years old (+12.5%). Conclusions: After a significant reduction in FS from 2004 to 2013, FS was strongly compromised from 2014 to 2018 likely as result of disruptions in access to foods in all regions, intensified by the sociodemographic inequality in Brazil.

The paper aims to develop the methodology for choosing the best available structure of a logistics chain for deliveries of bulk cargoes. Methodology. The systematic approach is used to formalize the problem of choosing the optimal structure of a logistics chain: the total expenses are used to define the goal function, alternative logistics chain structures and numeric parameters of the request flow (the delivery distance and the consignment weight) are defined as control variables, and the random variables representing technological paramete s of servicing processes are used to consider the influence of the environment on the logistics chain. The mathematical model defines the functional dependence of the total expenses on the entities within the delivery chain on the request flow parameters for two alternative structures: the delivery with transshipment in one freight terminal and the delivery through two terminals. By using functional analysis, we define the ranges of the request flow parameters where the use of a given logistics chain structure is characterized by minimal total expenses. Findings. The experimental studies conducted considering two alternative logistics chain structures have shown that the better solution varies depending on the values of the request parameters. It allowed us to state that the ranges of the numeric parameters of the request flow may be defined to substantiate the optimal logistics chain structure for deliveries of bulk loads. Originality.

It is generally admitted that patients followed for autoimmune diseases have an increased risk of infectious complications compared to the general population (1). However, to date, there is no established relationship between autoimmune diseases and an increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 (2). Objectives: The primary objective was to assess the severity of COVID-19 in patients followed in our department. The secondary objective was to assess the subgroup of patients on immunosuppressants. Methods: We conducted a descriptive retrospective study of patients followed in the Department of Rheumatology of the University Hospital of Ibn Rochd, Casablanca. The patients who presented with COVID-19 between 08/2020 and 12/2020 were included. Epidemiological, clinical, therapeutic, and evolutionary data were collected and analyzed. Results: Our series included 30 patients, with a sex ratio M/F of 0.3. The mean age of the patients was 46.4 years (±16.3), with a mean follow-up time of 8.1 years. 7 patients had a metabolic syndrome. Patients were followed for rheumatoid arthritis (n = 4), spondyloarthritis (n = 10), systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 5), scleroderma (n = 2), polymyalgia rheumatica (n = 1), adult onset Still'sdisease (n = 1), polyosteoarthritis (n = 6), benign osteopathy (n = 1). 17 patients were in low disease activity when they presented the COVID-19. 8 patients presented moderate to high activity, of which 2 (25%) developed a form requiring hospitalization. 7 patients were under NSAIDs, 13 under corticosteroids, 19 under csDMARD, 7 under bDMARD. The COVID-19 disease was symptomatic in 83% of cases, with fatigue (68%), cough (52%), back pain (48%), anosmia (48%), ageusia (44%), arthritis (44%), fever (36%). The diagnosis was made with polymerase chain reaction (83%), serology (10%), CT scan (23%). The CT lung lesions reached 25-50% in 2 lupus patients with a moderate disease activity, under corticosteroids and hydroxychloroquine. The involvement was > 75% in 2 patients, who admitted to intensive care: one was followed for polyarthrosis and was hypertensive and poorly balanced diabetic, and the other was followed for Horton's disease. The treatment was administered on an outpatient basis in 77.4% of cases, in an intensive care unit in 16% of cases. 30 patients fully recovered from infection, one patient died secondary to pulmonary embolism. The subgroup of patients on immunosuppressants consisted of 23 patients (76%), of whom 5 (22%) developed a moderate to severe form of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Among these hospitalized patients, 2 (40%) had moderate to high disease activity of their rheumatism. Conclusion: Most of the patients in our series presented a mild form of COVID-19, including those under immunosuppressants. Patients who were under hydroxychloroquine were not spared from COVID-19, but developed a mild form. The disease activity of the chronic rheumatism did not appear to influence the severity of the COVID-19.","El Moutaouakil, H.; El Ouali, Z.; Nassar, K.; Janani, S.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.2744,394

To eradicate this discomfort, a low cost and lightweight device named “PPE Cooler” has been introduced, which will minimize the discomfort by flowing air, considering the issue of protection from the nano-sized virus. During the trial, it was noticed that a person wearing a PPE kit with the “PPE Cooler” system felt much better than a person wearing a regular PPE kit. The device can also be attached to any PPE kit with the little operation. By using the device, PPE will be no more excruciating to our beloved doctors and their associates.

168663,The crisis impact on the tourist business development,2020,"Lipid Droplet (LD) is a ubiquitous cellular organelle that stores natural lipids as an energy and carbon source. It has emerged as a highly active organelle, engaged in lipid synthesis, protein storage, protein degradation, transportation, and metabolism. It stores natural lipids in the form of triacylglycerols (TAG) and steryl esters. TAGs consider promising biotechnological importance to produce biodiesel; thus, LD is considered a tremendous scientific concern in the modern era. The TAG accumulation is found in various feedstocks, but amongst the microorganisms becomes an evident alternative against animal and plant-derived sources due to economic reasons. Amid microorganisms, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a better alternative for industrial utilization but has low production of TAGs. Thus, to enhance the LD concentration, novel research was designed to induce alternate high and low sound frequency at a regular interval on a yeast model organism. The control and treated yeast samples further investigated using biochemical, biophysical, and computational tools to conclude that cells increase lipid droplet production under regulative noise exposure. The results endorsed that noise induces yeast LD yield is significantly higher than control, which could be considered a milestone in the biodiesel industry development and the biodiesel policy. This analysis also helps researchers to understand the novel function of LDs and their regulation in cell metabolism.","Kumar, Reetesh",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.22.387878,394
168695,Multiobjective Contactless Delivery on Medical Supplies under Open-Loop Distribution,2021,"Evaluation of information retrieval systems follows the Cranfield paradigm, where the evaluation of several IR systems relies on a common evaluation environment (test collection and evaluation settings). The Cranfield paradigm requires the evaluation environment (EE) to be strictly identical to compare system’s performances. For those cases where such paradigm cannot be used, e.g. when we do not have access to the code of the systems, we consider an evaluation framework that allows for slight changes in the EEs, as the evolution of the document corpus or topics. To do so, we propose to compare systems evaluated on different environments using a reference system, called pivot. In this paper, we present and validate a method to select a pivot, which is used to construct a correct ranking of systems evaluated in different environments. We test our framework on the TREC-COVID test collection, which is composed of five rounds of growing topics, documents and relevance judgments. The results of our experiments show that the pivot strategy can propose a correct ranking of systems evaluated in an evolving test collection. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","González-Sáez, G.

The COVID-19 pandemic has led the change in daily habits through the introduction of personal protective equipment (e.g., face mask) into everyday routine. The use of an instrumented face mask to monitor heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) of workers in occupational settings may be useful to better understand the physiological conditions and the presence of environmental and physical stressors.Among many methods used to estimate these two vital signs, photoplethysmography has gained broad acceptance in the scientific community. Several sites have been used to place the photoplethysmographic sensor (e.g., ear lobe and finger-tip) to estimate the above-mentioned physiological parameters. In this paper, we proposed a smart face mask (SFM) instrumented by a photoplethysmographic sensor. This configuration is particularly adequate to be used in those occupational settings which require the use of common input peripherals (e.g., mouse and keyboard) which prompt to fast movement of hands and fingers, limiting the performance of common measurement systems (e.g., smartwatches) due to motion artifacts. The proof of concept of SFM has been conducted by mimicking conditions close to the mentioned occupational settings through the use of a low computational power algorithm. The proposed system showed promising results by returning values in agreement with the reference system mimicking RR in a wide range of values. © 2021 IEEE.","Sabbadini, R.; Di Tocco, J.; Massaroni, C.; Schena, E.; Carassiti, M.","2021 IEEE International Symposium on Medical Measurements and Applications, MeMeA 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/memea52024.2021.9478599,394

Public health interventions in response to burgeoning case numbers and hospitalizations have repeatedly bent down the epidemic curve in many jurisdictions, effectively creating a closed-loop dynamic system. We aim to formalize and illustrate how to incorporate principles of feedback control into pandemic projections and decision making. Starting with a SEEIQR epidemiological model, we illustrate how feedback control can be incorporated into pandemic management using a simple design (proportional-integral or PI control), which couples recent changes in case numbers or hospital occupancy with explicit policy restrictions. We then analyse a closed-loop system between the SEEIQR model and the designed feedback controller to illustrate the potential benefits of pandemic policy design that incorporates feedback. We first explored a feedback design that responded to hospital measured infections, demonstrating robust ability to control a pandemic despite simulating large uncertainty in reproduction number R0 (range: 1.04-5.18) and average time to hospital admission (range: 4-28 days). The second design compared responding to hospital occupancy to responding to case counts, showing that shorter delays reduced both the cumulative case count and the average level of interventions. Finally, we show that feedback is robust to changing public compliance to public health directives, and to systemic changes associated with new variants of concern and with the introduction of a vaccination program. The negative impact of a pandemic on human health and societal disruption can be reduced by coupling models of disease propagation with models of the decision-making process. This creates a closed-loop system that better represents the coupled dynamics of a disease and public health responses. Importantly, we show that feedback control is robust to delays in both measurements and responses, and to uncertainty in model parameters and the efficacy of control measures.","Van Heusden, K.; Stewart, G.; Otto, S.; Dumont, G.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.23.21263924v1?rss=1,394

However, these outbreaks are generally only dealt with seriously when the viruses concerned have been confirmed and classified as zoonotic. Arenavirus haemorrhagic fever viruses can cause epidemics in some areas of the world. To assess the potential of similar viruses to become zoonotic in the future, bioinformatics of relatively conserved virus proteins, such as the L polymerase of arenaviruses, can be used to identify homology with viruses that might give future outbreaks. In this paper, new and archival metazoan transcriptome sequence data was used as a resource to identify similar sequences to known arenavirus sequences for the purpose of risk prediction. In essence, bioinformatics was utilized to provide a better understanding of the potential evolution and natural history of uncharacterized virus sequences in the GenBank database. Several matches were identified which, along with a reasoned approach to their phyla, was used to provide a likelihood score of their zoonotic potential.","Alrashedi, Hasan; Jones, Ian; Mulley, Geraldine; Neuman, Benjamin W",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/178012,394

Then, joint lesions can only be observed and inferred from two-dimensional images, and it is difficult to perform accurate joint assessments, which is essential for the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Objectives: To develop the next-generation online telemedicine system utilizing mixed reality for RA. Methods: We have developed a system that can assess joints accurately in three-dimensions images in real-time, using Azure Kinect DK (depth sensor)/ HoloLens 2 (headset), which are mixed reality technologies, and Teams (online interview/chat) provided by Microsoft. Furthermore, by applying artificial intelligence (AI), we plan to implement additionally to this system 1) a function to quickly catch and automatically evaluate the patient's anxiety and changes in facial expressions at the time of examination, 2) a function to record dialogue with the patient in chronological order, 3) a function to support the detection of swollen joints, and 4) function to automatically analyze the questionnaire. Results: This system remotely connects a rheumatologist in the Nagasaki University Hospital (Nagasaki City, urban area) and a patient with RA and a non-rheumatologist in the Goto Central Hospital (Goto Island, rural area). A three-dimensional hologram of the patient's hand projected in front of a rheumatologist.

We further develop an existing framework and operationalise transformative capacities as: (1) reconnecting social and ecological systems dynamics in ways that are mutually supportive, healthy, and regenerative of life-support systems;(2) fostering healthy individual and political agency;and (3) contributing to building rich community relationships and enhancing social cohesion. Through this lens we explore the practices, activities, and strategies of nine SOHOs in and around the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona. We show that SOHOs emerge from and are decisive in further building transformative capacities within communities creating contagious virtuous cycles.

This designation is based on a single epidemiological study suggesting an association between facemask ventilation and transmission from the SARS 2003 outbreak. There is no direct evidence to indicate whether facemask ventilation is a high-risk procedure for aerosol generation. We conducted aerosol monitoring during routine facemask ventilation, and facemask ventilation with an intentionally generated leak, in anaesthetised patients with neuromuscular blockade. Recordings were made in ultraclean theatres and compared against the aerosol generated by the patient during their own tidal breathing and coughs. Respiratory aerosol from tidal breathing was reliably detected above the very low background particle concentrations (191 (77-486 [3.8-1313]) versus 2.1 (0.7-4.6 [0-12.9] particles/L median(IQR)[range], n=11, p=0.002). The average aerosol concentration detected during facemask ventilation both without a leak (3.0 particles/L (0-9 [0-43])) and with an intentional leak (11 particles/L (7.0 - 26 [1-62])) was 64-fold and 17-fold lower than that of tidal breathing (p=0.001 and p=0.002 respectively). The peak particle concentration during facemask ventilation both without a leak (60 particles/L (0 - 60 [0-120])) and with a leak (120 particles/L (60 - 180 [60-480]) were respectively 20-fold and 10-fold lower than a cough (1260 particles/L (800 - 3242 [100-3682]), p=0.002 and p=0.001 respectively). This study demonstrates that facemask ventilation, even performed with an intentional leak, does not generate high levels of bioaerosol.

169649,I-AID: Identifying Actionable Information from Disaster-related Tweets,2021,"Introduction The 2020 Covid-19 pandemic saw a marked nationwide reduction in hospital admissions due to cardiovascular disease. In many institutions, including ours, it also saw redistribution of patient care from a specialty-based approach to a ward-based system, meaning patients being admitted and remaining under the care of non-specialist teams. We wished to examine the impact of these changes on heart failure patients presenting during the pandemic and on appropriate delivery of complex device therapies. Methods The study was undertaken in a large UK teaching hospital, where the annual audit programme includes NICE guidance (Technology Appraisal 314: Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators and Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy for Arrhythmias and Heart Failure). As per the NICE guideline, patients admitted to hospital were identified, using discharge codes, with: serious ventricular arrhythmia;familial cardiac condition with high risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD);surgical repair of congenital heart disease;and patients with heart failure and LVEF &lt;36%. Findings during the pandemic (March to August 2020) were compared with non-pandemic (the same period in 2019). Fisher's exact test was used to compare proportions. Results Table 1 shows how many patients were eligible for device therapy and how many were offered it. Among nonheart failure patients, device therapy prescription was consistent in the 2 periods observed. Table 2 shows details of heart failure admissions during the study periods. Among heart failure patients, an 8% reduction in hospital admissions due to heart failure was observed during the pandemic. Among these patients, the proportion eligible for device therapy did not alter significantly. However, there was a significant reduction in the proportion of eligible patients who were offered device therapy (79% vs 94%, p=0.03). In addition, there was a trend towards a greater chance of patients being considered too frail for device therapy during the pandemic (p=0.08). Among 12 patients overlooked for device therapy, 10 were not under the care of Cardiology. Among 31 patients considered too frail for device therapy, 26 were not under the care of Cardiology. Conclusion During the Covid-19 pandemic, a modest reduction in hospital admission for heart failure was observed with a marked fall in identification of those eligible for device therapy. There are a number of possible explanations, including the lack of recognition of indications for device therapy when patients are under the care of non-specialists, an increased perception of patient frailty during a crisis and intense pressure to discharge patients quickly. These findings suggest that cardiac services should actively look for heart failure patients who may have missed out on life-saving device therapies during the pandemic.","Hall, R.; Chattopadhyay, R.; Pugh, P.

Diet and lifestyle interventions are effective but are often temporary and many individuals regain weight. High-fat diet increases the excitability of AgRP neurons, a critical neuronal population for the regulation of food intake and body weight. Here we investigate the plasticity of AgRP neurons and the impact of high-fat diet on modulation by synaptic input. We find that diet-induced hyperexcitability of AgRP neurons is not reversed by a lower-fat diet intervention. High-fat diet is associated with changes in the synaptic modulation of AgRP neurons, with a paradoxical increase in inhibitory input accompanied by a loss of GABA-mediated inhibition due to a depolarizing shift in the reversal potential of the GABA-evoked Cl− current. These findings reveal that high-fat diet leads to decoupling of intrinsic and synaptic excitability in AgRP neurons, such that hyperexcitability of AgRP neurons persists despite an increase in inhibitory input, revealing a mechanism for the difficulty in sustaining weight loss.","Korgan, Austin C.; Wei, Wei; Martin, Sophie L.

Methods: We used meta-analytic methods to estimate background rates of 21 medical conditions considered potential AESI and calculated expected rates of each potential AESI within 1 day, 7 days, and 42 days of vaccination. Results: Background rates of three commonly monitored AESI, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), myopericarditis, and all-cause deaths were 2.0 GBS cases/100,000 person-years, 1.3 myopericarditis cases/100,000 person-years, and 863.8 all-cause deaths/100,000 person-years, respectively.

Directed energy deposition (DED) is one of the main laser-based additive manufacturing processes, but a fundamental understanding of the process is lacking partly because it has not been the focus of highspeed, in-situ x-ray imaging studies like laser powder bed fusion has. A novel in-situ DED system is presented here, and an experimental study is performed to show that the small-scale system recovers processing parameter trends of a full-scale build. Observed meltpool lengths range from about 200 μm to 900 μm, while meltpool depths range from about 50 μm to 500 μm and can support high-fidelity modelling. Additionally, an investigation on the relationship between meltpool dimensions and global energy density GED' is performed. It was found that GED' is not a good predictor of meltpool dimensions due to the discrepancy in linear and exponential trends in laser powder and powder mass flowrate. Further studies and analysis using the presented novel DED system are needed to develop an appropriate energy density term to predict of meltpool dimension and clad height.","Webster, Samantha; Ehmann, Kornel; Cao, Jian",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920315535; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920315535,394

Design/methodology/approach It can be defined as a functional type for Cobb Douglas development. ARDL technology is a way of calculating complex forces at the classification level at long-term and short-term stages. This ARDL approach has many advantages and can be implemented when incorporated in level I (0) and level I first (1) with the original variable. Still, it offers robust ability to the outcomes and standardizes the lag, considering the number and sample size used.

Findings There is a positive partnership between creativity and a sustainable world. Corporations are recommended to uphold the principles of CSR in the development process by introducing environmentally friendly advanced technologies. The main objectives of corporate social responsibility (CSR) are economic growth, environmental sustainability and social justice. Several programs have been established to expand businesses' responsibilities to improve their confessions in sustainable growth.

The key concerns of stakeholders and politicians in the new competitive business climate are the protection of environmental sustainability and social responsibility, recognizing factors driving economic development for SMEs. Originality/value During the COVID-19 era, the prime responsibility of pandemic confronting governments is to spend on help activities (that have been started in earlier phase) and recovery endeavors (yet to start in the situation). Therefore, the governments may devise policies to pool resources from commercial, private, public-private partnerships and other capital market sources. With rising hazard recognitions particularly emerging from at-threat income projections, governments ought to make the correct mechanisms and instruments that can perform this catalytic part of derisking and drawing in such capital. This too can be an opportunity for governments to enhance and execute such financial instruments that offer assistance, quicken their commitments to climate alter beneath the Paris Agreement and the sustainable development goals (SDGs), and thus ""build back better"" is being progressively voiced over the world.","Sadiq, M.; Nonthapot, S.; Mohamad, S.; Ehsanullah, S.; Iqbal, N.",China Finance Review International,https://doi.org/10.1108/cfri-02-2021-0038,394
170203,Brunei in 2020: Durable social compact in a turbulent year,2021,"The understanding of factors that affect the dissemination of a viral infection is fundamental to help combat it. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic that changed the lives of people all over the world, one observes regions with different incidences of cases. One can speculate that population density might be one of the variables that affect the incidence of cases. In populous areas, such as big cities or congested urban areas, higher COVID-19 incidences could be observed than in rural regions. It is natural to think that if population density is such an important factor, then a gradient or difference in population density might lead to a diffusion process that will proceed until equilibrium is reached. The aim of this paper consists of the inclusion of a diffusion concept into the COVID-19 modeling. With this concept, one covers a gradient-driven transfer of the infection next to epidemic growth models (SIR-type models). This is discussed for a certain period of the German situation based on the quite different incidence data for the different federal states of Germany. With this ansatz, some phenomena of the actual development of the pandemic are found to be confirmed. The model provides a possibility to investigate certain scenarios, such as border-crossings or local spreading events, and their influence on the COVID-19 propagation.

But still the number of cases of Children where less as compared to adults and those having underlying pulmonary pathology or immunocompromising conditions are more vulnerable to infection. Some studies have shown that this virus causes more death in the older age population as compared to adults or children. Patients having any systemic conditions like diabetes, raised blood pressure, heart diseases, lung diseases and chronic renal diseases were more vulnerable to this infection. In this article, we will outline the epidemiology, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment modalities of the novel coronavirus-2019(COVID 19) infection in humans, with more focusing on infection in children as well as in older adults.","Reche, A.; Nandanwar, A.; Hedaoo, A.; Chhbra, K.

Design: A prospective observational study. Setting: A tertiary hospital intensive care unit (ICU). Participants: One hundred eighty-one septic patients who were on mechanical ventilation. Interventions: Echocardiography was performed within 24 hours of ICU admission. Measurements and Main Results: Several echocardiographic parameters, including TAPSE and RVOT-FS, as well as prognostic information, were collected. A Cox regression survival analysis showed that TAPSE was independently associated with one-year all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.407, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.200-0.827, p = 0.013), but ROVT-FS was not (HR 0.997, 95% CI: 0.970-1.025, p = 0.828). ROC analysis showed that the optimal cutoff value for TAPSE and RVOT-FS to determine one-year mortality was TAPSE &lt;18 mm and RVOT-FS &lt;40%. The one-year mortality in patients with low TAPSE (n = 88) and in patients with both low TAPSE and low RVOT-FS (n = 60) was 45.5% and 48.3%, respectively;p = 0.724. In a multivariate analysis, RVOT-FS did not add significant prognostic information to that provided by TAPSE &lt;18 mm (p = 0.197). Conclusions: TAPSE was an independent predictor of one-year all-cause mortality in mechanically ventilated septic patients. RVOT-FS was not associated with one-year mortality and added no prognostic value to TAPSE in these patients.","Zhang, HongMin Chen XiuKai Lian Hui Zhang Qing Wang XiaoTing Zheng Min Liu DaWei",Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.jvca.2020.10.002,394
171084,Comparison of social media platforms in terms of marketing performances of food companies: IJFS,2021,"Paramyxoviruses are a diverse group of negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses of which several species cause significant mortality and morbidity. In recent years the collection of paramyxoviruses sequences detected in wild mammals has substantially grown, however little is known about paramyxovirus diversity in North American mammals. To better understand natural paramyxovirus diversity, host range, and host specificity, we sought to comprehensively characterize paramyxoviruses across a range of diverse co-occurring wild small mammals in Southern Arizona. We used highly degenerate primers to screen fecal and urine samples and obtained a total of 55 paramyxovirus sequences from 12 rodent species and 6 bat species. We also performed illumina RNA-seq and de novo assembly on 14 of the positive samples to recover a total of 5 near full-length viral genomes. We show there are at least 2 clades of rodent-borne paramyxoviruses in Arizona, while bat-associated paramyxoviruses formed a putative single clade. Using structural homology modeling of the viral attachment protein, we infer that three of the five novel viruses likely bind sialic acid in a manner similar to other Respiroviruses, while the other two viruses from Heteromyid rodents likely bind a novel host receptor. We find no evidence for cross-species transmission, even among closely related sympatric host species. Taken together, these data suggest paramyxoviruses are a common viral infection in some bat and rodent species present in North America, and illuminate the evolution of these viruses. Importance There are a number of viral lineages that are potential zoonotic threats to humans. One of these, paramyxoviruses, have jumped into humans multiple times from wild and domestic animals. We conducted one of the largest viral surveys of wild mammals in the United States to better understand paramyxovirus diversity and evolution.","Larsen, Brendan B.; Gryseels, Sophie; Otto, Hans W.; Worobey, Michael",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.01.450817,394

The 51 stedition scheduled for 8–11 April 2020 however three weeks prior it was announced that the event would be cancelled. The decision to cancel was not a popular one and given all the stakeholders involved it was also challenging. Drawing on primary and secondary data, this paper considers factors leading to the decision to cancel, stakeholder engagement and associated organizational and socio-economic impacts. Primary data included key informant interviews with the race director and stakeholders. The findings reveal that the last minute decision to cancel came at a huge cost to the event amidst growing uncertainty, however it is still viewed as the right decision. Regarding lessons learned, race organizers highlighted critical areas including process changes and stakeholder management. A more comprehensive risk management approach is also required.","Swart, Kamilla; Maralack, David",Sport Soc.,https://doi.org/10.1080/17430437.2020.1805900,394

A team of six academics functioned as a resource panel in delivering synchronous online lecture content. These interactive sessions were led by a moderator inquiring the resource panel on topics related to the content of the lecture. This was done in the same spirit on how a panel discussion would be conducted led by a moderator in a conference. Microsoft Teams Live was used in the delivery of the content to an audience of up to 800 students. Delivering a freshers programming course is known to be challenging in face- to-face delivery. A collaborative programming environment was used to engage students in live coding activities during the lectures. Students had opportunities to interact with the resource panel through quizzes, QA and through coding related activities. These lectures also introduced the innovative use of QR codes to get students engagement through a mobile device for the interactive sessions. Results based on a survey shared among the participated students, confirmed the collaborative teaching approach in conducting webinar was more effective over a traditional webinar that is conducted by one person.

While animal research suggests these biological processes are related to one another, our knowledge of brain development in humans is largely based on age-related processes. Thus, the current study characterized puberty-related changes in human brain structure, by combining data from two longitudinal neuroimaging cohorts. Beyond normative changes in cortical thickness, we examined whether individual differences in the rate of pubertal maturation (or “pubertal tempo”) was associated with variations in cortical trajectories. Participants (N = 192; scans = 366) completed up to three waves of MRI assessments between 8.5 and 14.5 years of age, as well as questionnaire assessments of pubertal stage at each wave. Generalized additive mixture models were used to characterize trajectories of cortical development. Results revealed widespread linear puberty-related changes across much of the cortex. Many of these changes, particularly within the frontal and parietal cortices, were independent of age-related development. Males exhibiting faster pubertal tempo demonstrated greater thinning in the precuneus and frontal cortices than same-aged and -sex peers. Findings suggest that the unique influence of puberty on cortical development may be more extensive than previously identified, and also emphasize important individual differences in the coupling of these developmental processes.","Vijayakumar, Nandita; Youssef, George; Allen, Nicholas B; Anderson, Vicki; Efron, Daryl; Hazell, Philip; Mundy, Lisa; Nicholson, Jan M; Patton, George; Seal, Marc L; Simmons, Julian G; Whittle, Sarah; Silk, Tim",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.05.370460,394

171897,Cognitive and Energetic Sustainability for Development: Spain and Europe before the Green Deal,2021,"Basic summary statistics that quantify the population genetic structure of influenza virus are important for understanding and inferring the evolutionary and epidemiological processes. However, global virus sequences were sampled continuously over several decades, scattered semi-randomly over time. This temporal structure of samples and the small effective size of viral population make it difficult to use conventional methods to calculate summary statistics. Here we define statistics that overcome this problem by correcting for sampling time difference in quantifying a pairwise sequence difference. A simple method of linear regression jointly estimates the mutation rate and the level of sequence polymorphism, thus providing the estimate of the effective population size. It also leads to the definition of Wright’s FST for arbitrary time-series data. In addition, as an alternative to Tajima’s D statistic or site frequency spectrum, mismatch distribution corrected for sampling time differences can be obtained and compared between actual and simulated data. Application of these methods to seasonal influenza A/H3N2 viruses sampled between 1980 and 2017 and sequences simulated under the model of recurrent positive selection with meta-population dynamics allowed us to estimate the synonymous mutation rate and find parameter values of selection and demographic structure that fit the observation. We found that the mutation rates of HA and PB1 segments before 2007 were particularly high, and that adding recurrent positive selection in our model was essential for the genealogical structure of the HA segment. Methods developed here can be generally applied to population genetic inferences using serially sampled genetic data.","Croze, Myriam; Kim, Yuseob",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.30.229237,394

Material & Methods: Total 100 adult patients were included all were suffering from corona virus infection. COVID-19 infected patients belonging to both genders with no other cause of anemia were selected and all adult patients in which anemia was due to diseases other than corona infection were excluded. The blood samples of COVID-19 infected patients was taken in 5cc syringe and was send to the laboratory of Rawal Institute Of Health Sciences Islamabad for hemoglobin estimation. Blood heamoglobin (Hb) at the time of admission was recorded. Changes in their blood Hb was noted. Data was be entered into SPSS version 23, normality of data was checked. For nonnormally distributed data kruskal wallis and Mann whitney U test was applied and for normally distributed data Anova and post hoc was used. Spearsman correlation was used to correlate non distributed data and Pearson’s correlation was used for normally distributed data. Results: 100 adult patients were divided in two groups. Group I with mild symptoms of corona virus and group II with severe symptoms of corona virus. Patients with mild corona symptoms their blood hemoglobin level was 12.2 g/dl and those with severe corona symptoms their blood hemoglobin level was 10.0 g/dl. Conclusion: It was observed that patients suffering from severe disease of corona COVID-19 had reduced hemoglobin levels than those suffering from milder form of disease, thus confirming that corona virus effects the hemoglobin level and reduces its serum value causing anemia leading to complication of disease.

A total of 16,953 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were obtained and are not proportionally representative of the five Brazilian geographical regions. A comparative sequence analysis was conducted to identify common mutations located at 42 positions of the genome (38 were in coding regions whereas two in 5’ and two in 3’ UTR). Moreover, 11 were synonymous and 27 missense variants, and more than 44.4% were located in the spike gene. Across the total of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) identified, 32 were found in genomes obtained from all five Brazilian regions. While a high genomic diversity is reported in Europe given the large number of sequenced genomes, Africa is emerging as a hotspot for new variants. In South America, Brazil and Chile, rates are similar to those found in South Africa and India, giving enough space to generate new viral mutations.

Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) consists of vaccination and the injection of anti-rabies immunoglobulins (RIGs) around the (bite) wound. This is 100% effective in preventing disease if administered in a timely manner. However, the costs, the required cold chain for storage and transport and the limited availability of RIGs makes the treatment challenging. Cheaper and easier to produce alternatives are urgently needed. To aid in the discovery and development of such alternative therapeutics, we developed a physiological relevant infection model. Strips of freshly dissected swine skeletal muscle were placed under tension in culture medium and infected with RABV. Viral antigens were produced in the muscle explants and the virus production increased significantly over time, indicating that RABV infects and replicates in the muscle explants. Subsequently, in a search for inhibitors of RABV entry in muscle cells, we first screened a panel of 34 different lectins in a RABV / BHK-21J cell assay. The Urtica Dioica (stinging nettle) Agglutinin (UDA; a N-acetyl-D-glucosamine specific agglutinin) was found to be able to completely inhibit infection of cells with the RABV (EC50 8.2 μg/mL) by preventing binding of the virus to the host cell. When the infection of the muscle strips was carried out in the presence of UDA, infection of the tissue was completely prevented. We thus developed a physiological relevant RABV muscle infection model and identified an easy to produce component that (i) may serve as a reference for further studies and (ii) holds promise as an alternative for RIGs in PEP.","Wang, Xinyu; Terrie, Lisanne; Wu, Guanghui; Van Damme, Els; Thorrez, Lieven; Fooks, Anthony R; Banyard, Ashley C; Neyts, Johan; Jochmans, Dirk",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.21.441744,394

Patients on insulin were more likely to keep their appointment (OR = 1.70, p=0.008), while patients with higher HbA1c were less likely to (OR = 0.87 for each 1.0% increase in HbA1c, p=0.011). These findings suggest that for systems designed to optimize engagement during care disruption, one-way communication is no better than no contact, and two-way communication increases the likelihood that patients will maintain access to care. In addition, while higher risk patients (e.g., older age or on insulin) may be more incentivized to stay engaged, targeted outreach may be needed for those with chronic poor glycemic control.","Cromwell, Grace Hudson Margo McKitrick Charles K.; Donahue, Marina Smith Colleen M.; Fowler, Kristen M.; Del Valle, Kayla L.; Simonson, Donald C.; McDonnell, Marie E.",Diabetes,https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-849-p,394

They are coordinates associated with each word in a dictionary, inferred from statistical properties of these words in a large corpus. In this paper we introduce the notion of""concept""as a list of words that have shared semantic content. We use this notion to analyse the learnability of certain concepts, defined as the capability of a classifier to recognise unseen members of a concept after training on a random subset of it. We first use this method to measure the learnability of concepts on pretrained word embeddings. We then develop a statistical analysis of concept learnability, based on hypothesis testing and ROC curves, in order to compare the relative merits of various embedding algorithms using a fixed corpora and hyper parameters. We find that all embedding methods capture the semantic content of those word lists, but fastText performs better than the others.","Sutton, Adam; Cristianini, Nello",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.09896v1.pdf,394

In contrary to decrease seen in primary pollutant species, many of the countries have experienced elevated ground-level ozone levels in this period. Air pollution forecast gains more importance to achieve air quality management and take measures against the risks under such extra-ordinary conditions. Statistical models are indispensable tools for predicting air pollution levels. Considering the complex photochemical reactions involved in tropospheric ozone formation, modeling this pollutant requires efficient non-linear approaches. In this study, deep learning methods were applied to forecast hourly ozone levels during pandemic lock-down for an industrialized region in Turkey. With this aim, different deep learning methods were tested and efficiencies of the models were compared considering the calculated RMSE, MAE, R2 and loss values.","Ekinci, Ekin Iacute; lhan Omurca, Sevinç Özbay Bilge",Ecological Modelling,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2021.109676,394
173791,"Towards a ""better normal"": Educational experiences in design in latin America during the COVID-19 pandemic",2020,"Insects detect volatile chemicals using antennae, which house a vast variety of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) that innervate hair-like structures called sensilla where odor detection takes place. In addition to OSNs, the antenna also hosts various support cell types. These include the triad of trichogen, tormogen and thecogen support cells that lie adjacent to their respective OSNs. The arrangement of OSN supporting cells occurs stereotypically for all sensilla and is widely conserved in evolution. While insect chemosensory neurons have received considerable attention, little is known about the functional significance of the cells that support them. For instance, it remains unknown whether support cells play an active role in odor detection, or only passively contribute to homeostasis, e.g. by maintaining sensillum lymph composition. To investigate the functional interaction between OSNs and support cells, we used optical and electrophysiological approaches in Drosophila. First, we characterized the distribution of various supporting cells using genetic markers. By means of an ex vivo antennal preparation and genetically-encoded Ca2+ and K+ indicators, we then studied the activation of these auxiliary cells during odor presentation in adult flies. We observed acute responses and distinct differences in Ca2+ and K+ fluxes between support cell types. Finally, we observed alterations in OSN responses upon thecogen cell ablation in mature adults. Upon inducible ablation of thecogen cells, we notice a gain in mechanical responsiveness to mechanical stimulations during single-sensillum recording, but a lack of change to neuronal resting activity. Taken together, these results demonstrate that support cells play a more active and responsive role during odor processing than previously thought. Our observations thus reveal that support cells functionally interact with OSNs and may be important for the extraordinary ability of insect olfactory systems to dynamically and sensitively discriminate between odors in the turbulent sensory landscape of insect flight.","Prelic, Sinisa; Mahadevan, Venkatesh Pal; Venkateswaran, Vignesh; Lavista-Llanos, Sofia; Hansson, Bill S.; Wicher, Dieter",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.04.463011,394

Self-isolation regime is an effective measure to contain the pandemic (Alfano, Ercolano, 2020), but the psychological factors predicting compliance with stay-at-home recommendations (CSHR) are understudied. We hypothesized that 1) defensive optimism and constructive optimism will have opposite effects on CSHR, 2) the effect of defensive optimism will be mediated through a decrease of anxiety (fear of infection).Objectives. The purpose of this study was to assess the direct and indirect (through the fear of infection) effects of defensive optimism (belief that coronavirus problem is exaggerated) and constructive optimism (belief that people’s efforts help to prevent infection and spread of the virus) on CSHR, controlling for dispositional optimism.Methods. A longitudinal study (from 10/4/2020 till 2/6/2020) was conducted on a sample of 306 university students (89% women, MA=21.20, SD=4.54) using a single-item measure of CSHR, LOT-R (Scheier et al., 1994), the scales of defensive and constructive optimism (Gordeeva, Sychev, 2020), and anxiety in a pandemic situation questionnaire (Tkhostov, Rasskazova, 2020).Results. During seven-week interval CSHR has decreased dramatically (Cohen’s d=0.66, p<0.001) while the other variables remained stable. Using SEM we have showed that CSHR at the end of study (T2) is predicted by the CSHR (T1) and through it by the defensive optimism (negative effect, p<0.05) and constructive optimism (positive effect, p<0.001). Negative effect of defensive optimism on CSHR is also mediated by the fear of infection (T2), reducing it. Dispositional optimism is associated only with constructive optimism.Conclusions.

Using data from Apple mobility trends and several time-series econometric models, we find that investors became active participants during the COVID-19 pandemic period and traded more bitcoins on days with low mobility associated with lockdown mandates. These results remain robust after controlling for stocks and gold returns, the VIX index, and the level of attention and sentiment toward Bitcoin, as measured by Google search frequencies and the tone of Tweets discussing Bitcoin. These results suggest that when individual investors have ample free time on their hands, they trade cryptocurrencies as a pastime and use the Bitcoin market as a form of entertainment.

We sought to understand acceptability of alternative service delivery methods among sexual health service clients in BC, Canada.MethodsWe used data from an online anonymous survey administered from 21/07/2020–04/08/2020 to clients (aged ≥16 years) who had used the BC Centre for Disease Control’s sexually-transmitted infection (STI) clinic and/or the GetCheckedOnline testing service in the year prior to COVID-19 public health responses (03/2020). We described participants’ likelihood of using potential alternative sexual health service delivery methods, and conducted bivariate analysis to examine its association with experiencing any sexual health service access barriers during the pandemic.ResultsOf the 1198 survey participants (aged 17–76 years), 48% identified as men, 47% as women, and 5% as another gender;71% identified as White, 24% as racialized minorities, and 4% as Indigenous. Overall, support for using alternative STI testing models was high, with 88% likely to use at-home self-collection kits and 79% likely to use an express testing model (i.e., phone/video triage prior to specimen collection at a clinic). More participants were likely to discuss sexual health with a healthcare provider over the phone (64%), compared with video visits (53%) and text (49%). Text messaging to receive STI test results and reminders were of high interest (71% and 63% likely to use, respectively). Likelihood of using alternative service delivery methods did not differ by participants’ experience of access barriers, where 66% of total participants reported having avoided/delayed seeking services during 03/2020–07/2020.ConclusionLikelihood of using potential alternative sexual health service delivery methods was high overall, including among participants who did not avoid/delay seeking services.

This paper investigates a novel concept of hospital-oriented quad-generation (HOQG) to produce a combined cooling, heating, power and gas (CCHPG) system. Local renewable energy source (RES), high temperature superconducting (HTS) power cable and superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) device are used as the low-carbon electricity producer, carrier and regulator, respectively. Compared to the conventional copper cable and electrochemical battery, HTS terminal power units have superior advantages of high-efficiency power delivery and high-quality power compensation. To accommodate the surplus electricity from local RESs and guarantee emergency supply for the targeted hospital buildings, three cryogenic fluids of liquefied methane gas, liquefied oxygen and liquefied nitrogen are used as back-ups for both energy fuel and medical gas. By adopting a series of cascade energy utilization and thermally-activated energy conversion facilities, multiple clean energies of cooling, heating and power are produced to supply medical devices, and multiple medical gases of oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide are delivered to hospitals for patient treatments. Compared to conventional diesel oil and compressed gas back-ups, these three cryogenic liquids have advantages of high-capacity, high-security storage and low-pollution utilization. Another possible benefit can be the low-temperature environment of these medical gases offers vaccines an appropriate delivering pathway against the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the proposed HOQG can be expected to fulfill the demand of energy conservation and emission reduction simultaneously during the normal operation, as well as the demand of sustainable energy and medical gas supply under severe conditions such as natural and man-made disasters.","Chen, Xiaoyuan Chen Yu Zhang Mingshun Jiang Shan Gou Huayu Pang Zhou Shen Boyang",Applied Energy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.117382,394

Zebrafish larvae were exposed to varying concentrations of chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine for 1 hr or 24 hr, and hair cells assessed by antibody staining. A significant, dose-dependent reduction in the number of surviving hair cells was seen across conditions for both exposure periods. Hydroxycholroquine showed similar toxicity. In mouse cochlear cultures, chloroquine damage was specific to outer hair cells in tissue from the cochlear basal turn, consistent with susceptibility to other ototoxic agents. These findings suggest a need for future studies employing hearing and balance monitoring during exposure to chloroquine and related compounds, particularly with interest in these compounds as therapeutics against viral infections including coronavirus.","Davis, Samantha N.; Wu, Patricia; Camci, Esra D.; Simon, Julian A.; Rubel, Edwin W; Raible, David W.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.041731,394

Of particular concern are socially vulnerable families, which have felt the impacts of the pandemic most acutely. Because stress can alter family dynamics, it is important to understand which stressors impact families the most, and what resources can be leveraged to strengthen family functioning. The current study examined the impacts of COVID-19 on the conflict and cohesion of households with children compared to households without children. Additionally, we sought to assess how conflict and cohesion are related to social vulnerabilities in the context of the pandemic. Using an international sample, we analyzed responses to the COVID-19 Household Environment Scale (N = 4,122) using descriptive and bivariate analyses. Latent class analysis was used to identify patterns of family functioning in households with and without children. We found that social vulnerability was associated with more disrupted family functioning, and that households with children (n = 2,666) reported less disrupted family functioning when compared to households without children (n = 1,456), despite having higher social vulnerability scores. Our exploratory latent class analysis identified a five-class model among both subgroups. Conflict, cohesion, family functioning, and social vulnerability varied significantly by subgroup and class membership. Our findings add to a body of evidence that argues that despite facing greater vulnerability, households with children have many strengths to draw from. Family interventions that help to promote family cohesion and conflict resolution can foster resilience in stressful circumstances.

Their use was prioritized to protect the most vulnerable, notably, the elderly. Because of fluctuations in vaccine availability, strategies such as delayed second dose and heterologous prime-boost have been employed. The effectiveness of these strategies in the frail elderly are unknown. Methods In this real-world vaccination study, under a government-decreed rationing strategy, elderly adults residing in long-term care facilities, with or without previously-documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, were administered homologous or heterologous mRNA vaccines, with an extended 16-week interval between doses. Clinical data and blood were serially collected during and after this interval period. Sera were tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies (to trimeric S; RBD; nucleocapsid) by automated chemiluminescent ELISA. Findings After a significant increase 4 weeks post-prime dose, there was a significant decline in anti-RBD and anti-S IgG levels until the boost dose, followed by an increase 4 weeks later. Previously uninfected individuals exhibited lower antibody responses up to 16 weeks post-prime dose, but achieved comparable levels to previously infected counterparts by 4 weeks post-second dose. Individuals primed with BNT162b2 exhibited larger decrease in anti-RBD and anti-S IgG levels with 16-week interval between doses, compared to those who received mRNA-1273. No differences in antibody levels 4 weeks after the second dose were noted between the two vaccines, in either homologous or heterologous combinations. Interpretations These interim results of this ongoing longitudinal study show that, among frail elderly, neither age, sex, nor comorbidity affect antigenicity of mRNA-based COVID vaccines, but previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and type of mRNA vaccine influenced antibody responses when used with a 16-week interval between doses. Homologous/heterologous use of mRNA vaccines was not associated with significant differences in antibody responses 4 weeks following second dose, supporting their interchangeability.","Vinh, D.

A pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) is the best option by providing fast and efficient symptomatic relief within the lung. However, the rapid development of new inhalation devices could be critical in this competitive environment, and optimizing the inhalation devices could be costly and time-consuming. Therefore, the computational fluid dynamic (CFD) approach was used to shorten the development time. In this study, response surface methodology (RSM) in ANSYS version 19.2 was introduced to discover the optimal design for the actuator nozzle to increase the performance of pMDI. Three (3) parameters (orifice diameter, length, and actuator angle) were optimized, and the best design was selected according to the analysis of particle tracking. The analysis of spray plume was also conducted and compared to analyze the spray plume characteristic produced by three designs. The result showed that RSM generated three (3) models for the new design of the actuator nozzle (Design A, Design B, and Design C). Among three (3) designs, actuator nozzle design C showed the highest injection particle number (232457) and the only one that produced maximum particles velocity magnitude in the acceptable ranges (35.67m/s). All three designs showed a similar pattern as maximum particle velocity magnitude decreased along the axial length until they match the air velocity (0.03-0.04 m/s). Furthermore, the spray plume length, angle, and width were observed to increase linearly with the decreasing maximum particle velocity magnitude. Thus, this study suggested that design C might have the potential as a new actuator nozzle to develop future pMDI to relieve the respiratory condition. © 2021, Penerbit Akademia Baru.

176654,Environmental Management of Agricultural Enterprises in the Context of European Environmentally - Friendly Food System,2021,"Background: The COVID era has shown a rise in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions. This is mainly due to COVID related complications. On the contrary, the public around the world have become more aware about maintaining proper hygiene by wearing masks , using hand wash and keeping themselves clean. As an audit, we conducted a retrospective analysis comparing neutropenic complications during the pre COVID and COVID times at our tertiary care cancer hospital. Methods: We collected data of febrile neutropenia admissions in ICU from March to July 2019-Non Covid (NC) and March to July 2020-Covid (C). The data collection was done including data on nadir total WBC count, use of GCSF, positive cultures, type of malignancy and deaths. The statistical analysis was done using SPSS software version 22. Results: There were 15 patients in the NC dataset and 18 patients in the C dataset. The mean age of NC was 59 (SD-9.2) and that of C was 57. 3 (SD-14). The age and sex were comparable in both the groups. The number of solid organ malignancies constituted 5 (33.33%) in NC set and 8 (44.44%) in C set. The hematological malignancies constituted 10 in each of C and NC sets. Gram negative sepsis was seen in 26.67% and 22.22% in NC and C dataset respectively. There were 4 (26.67%) deaths in NC group and 5 (27.28%) C group. Growth factors were received by 9 (60%) patients in NC group and 15 (83.3%) patients in the C group (p=0.0005). There was no significant difference in the admission, complication and death rates in ICU when comparing the two groups. These results have been depicted in Table. Conclusions: Despite the precautions taken by community during the COVID times, we conclude that there was no significant difference in the neutropenic complications. It also suggests that most of the neutropenic infections are related to the person's immunity rather than community transmission. The study limitation is that this is a single center study but further audits and prospective studies are warranted in this regard. (Table Presented).","Warrier, N.; Chandramohan, D.; Vallathol, D.

176764,"Understanding Economic, Social, and Environmental Sustainability Challenges in the Global South",2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, was identified in late 2019 and went on to cause over 3.3 million deaths in 15 months. To date, targeted antiviral interventions against COVID-19 are limited. The spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranges from asymptomatic to fatal disease. However, the reasons for varying outcomes to SARS-CoV-2 infection are yet to be elucidated. Here we show that an endogenously activated interferon lambda (IFNλ) pathway leads to resistance against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using a well-differentiated primary nasal epithelial cell (WD-PNEC) model from multiple adult donors, we discovered that susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but not respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, varied. One of four donors was resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection. High baseline IFNλ expression levels and associated interferon stimulated genes correlated with resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway in WD-PNECs with high endogenous IFNλ secretion resulted in higher SARS-CoV-2 titres. Conversely, prophylactic IFNλ treatment of WD-PNECs susceptible to infection resulted in reduced viral titres. An endogenously activated IFNλ response, possibly due to genetic differences, may be one explanation for the differences in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. Importantly, our work supports the continued exploration of IFNλ as a potential pharmaceutical against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Broadbent, Lindsay; Bamford, Connor G.G.; Campos, Guillermo Lopez; Manzoor, Sheerien; Courtney, David; Ali, Ahlam; Touzelet, Olivier; McCaughey, Conall; Mills, Ken; Power, Ultan F.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.17.456707,394

This is the first study to investigate the relationship between PM1.0 and FEV1 and FVC of young asthmatics in Hong Kong, based on personal exposures obtained from portable sensors. Our preliminary results show that a higher level of PM1.0, PM2.5 and PM10 would deteriorate the health conditions of young asthmatics in HK. All correlations between particulates and lung functions are significant and negative, including PM1.0 exposure vs. FEV1 (R2=12%; p=0.023), PM1.0 exposure vs. FVC (R2=15%; p=0.010), PM2.5 exposure vs. FEV1 (R2=13%; p=0.019), PM2.5 exposure vs. FVC (R2=16%; p=0.008), PM10 exposure vs. FEV1 (R2=14%; p=0.012), and PM10 exposure vs. FVC (R2=18%; p=0.005). Moreover, after accounting for covariates, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), temperature, and relative humidity, we found a significant relationship between PM1.0 exposure vs. FVC (Coefficient=-0.1224; p=0.032), PM2.5 exposure vs. FVC (Coefficient=-0.1177; p=0.021), PM10 exposure vs. FEV1 (Coefficient=-0.0703; p=0.019), and PM10 exposure vs. FVC (Coefficient=-0.1204; p=0.006). Further, using the pilot study data, we have performed a power analysis to estimate the sample size for our follow-up main study. Based on the primary null hypothesis that personal PM exposure would not change the FEV1 and FVC of young asthmatics in HK, the lowest sample size that gives 80% power at a 5% significance level is 107. Hence, the sample size (or the total number of participated asthma subjects) expected for the follow-up longitudinal clinical study should be 125 (after adjusting for the non-compliance and withdrawal of subjects). Our pilot study has demonstrated the feasibility of research into the effects of personal air pollutant exposure on health condition and health perception. Our follow-up study will address the challenges identified in the pilot study, based on the proposed follow-up actions for subject engagement, data collection, and data analysis.","Chow, K.; Han, Y.; Li, V.

176970,An Integrated SWARA-WASPAS Group Decision Making Framework to Evaluate Smart Card Systems for Public Transportation,2020,"Increasing use of digital tools in university teaching has drawn scholarly attention to the interaction between pedagogical design and digital technologies. The accelerated transition to online learning following the COVID-19 crisis has raised several questions regarding the links between technological affordances and learning strategies, especially with regard to the role of dialogue in learning. Based on a survey of 51 postgraduate students in a Danish university with Problem Based Learning as explicit teaching strategy, where collaborative interaction and dialogue are regarded as integral to learning, this study investigates how students navigated the altered learning environment. We found that students’ experiences with online teaching demonstrate reduced affordances for learning. They experienced decreased co-involvement in decision-making, decreased collaboration and a changed pedagogical setup that did not support learning through discursive meaning negotiations. Thus, whilst dialogues can be transformed by digital technology, these changes are not necessarily productive within an environment which emphasises democratic discourse. Arguably, the digital transformation will continue to evolve and influence the quality of university teaching. Our paper concludes by discussing the potential of democratic dialogic teaching to stimulate learning ecologies in online and hybrid learning environments. © 2021, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","Hindhede, A.

Cytokines are a major player in rejection, and we, therefore, explored the impact of interleukin-6 (IL6) and IL-6 receptor (IL6R) gene polymorphisms on the occurrence of rejection after renal transplantation. We performed an observational cohort study analyzing both donor and recipient DNA in 1,271 renal transplant-pairs from the University Medical Center Groningen in The Netherlands and associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with biopsy-proven rejection after kidney transplantation. The C-allele of the IL6R SNP (Asp358Ala: rs2228145 A>C, formerly rs8192284) in donor kidneys conferred a reduced risk of rejection following renal transplantation (HR 0.78 per C-allele; 95%-CI 0.67-0.90; P=0.001). On the other hand, the C-allele of the IL6 SNP (at position-174 in the promoter; rs1800795 G>C) in donor kidneys was associated with an increased risk of rejection for male organ donors (HR per C-allele 1.31; 95%-CI 1.08-1.58; P=0.0006), but not female organ donors (P=0.33). In contrast, neither the IL6 nor IL6R SNP in the recipient showed an association with renal transplant rejection. In conclusion, donor IL6 and IL6R genotypes but not recipient genotypes represent an independent prognostic marker for biopsy-proven renal allograft rejection.","Poppelaars, F.; Gaya da Costa, M.; Eskandari, S.

Here, we showed that pharmacological or genetic inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK) significantly attenuated macrophage NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Broad rewiring of intracellular metabolism and enhanced autophagic flux occurred in inflammasome-activated macrophages, but neither was necessary for the PDHK-regulated reduction of NLRP3 inflammasome activity. PDHK inhibition protected against inflammation-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and cristae remodeling and improved mitochondrial function by repurposing mitochondria from ROS production to ATP generation. Inhibition of PDHK increased the expression of the mitochondrial fusion protein optic atrophy-1 (OPA1). Suppression of OPA1 partially reversed the effect of PDHK inhibition on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In conclusion, our study suggests that inhibition of PDHK dampens macrophage NLRP3 inflammasome activation during acute inflammation by ameliorating mitochondrial damage in a mechanism separate from its canonical role as a metabolic regulator.","Meyers, Allison K.; Wang, Zhan; Han, Wenzheng; Zhao, Qingxia; Zabalawi, Manal; Liu, Juan; Manne, Rajesh K; Lin, Hui-Kuan; Furdui, Cristina M.; Locasale, Jason W.; McCall, Charles E.; Zhu, Xuewei",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.02.462869,394

Viral lipids are essential components, and viral-cell membrane fusion is the required entry step for most unrelated enveloped viruses. In this paper, we identified a porphyrin derivative of protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) that showed broad antiviral activities in vitro against a panel of enveloped pathogenic viruses including Lassa virus (LASV), Machupo virus (MACV), and SARS-CoV-2 as well as various subtypes of influenza A viral strains with IC50 values ranging from 0.91±0.25 μM to 1.88±0.34 μM. A mechanistic study using influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) as a testing strain showed that PPIX inhibits the infection in the early stage of virus entry through biophysically interacting with the hydrophobic lipids of enveloped virions, thereby inhibiting the formation of the negative curvature required for fusion and blocking the entry of enveloped viruses into host cells. In addition, the preliminary antiviral activities of PPIX were further assessed by testing mice infected with the influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) virus. The results showed that compared with the control group without drug treatment, the survival rate and mean survival time of the mice treated with PPIX were apparently prolonged. These data encourage us to conduct further investigations using PPIX as a lead compound for the rational design of lipid-targeting antivirals for the treatment of infection with enveloped viruses.","Lu, Shengsheng; Pan, Xiaoyan; Chen, Daiwei; Xie, Xi; Wu, Yan; Shang, Weijuan; Jiang, Xiaming; Sun, Yuan; Fan, Sheng; He, Jian",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.09.085811,394

This pandemic has led to short-term as well as long-term psychosocial and mental health implications for all family members. The magnitude of family resilience is determined by many vulnerability factors like developmental age, educational status, preexisting mental health condition, being economically underprivileged or being quarantined due to infection or fear of infection. Methods: PubMed, SCOPUS, MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Cochrane, and ProQuest were searched from the inception of the pandemic to December 31, 2020. Articles were screened for inclusion by Authors. Results: After exclusion, there were eight studies included in the analysis with 165,515 participants. The literature review demonstrated that pandemic has caused mental health problems such as anxiety, stress, and depression. Creating daily practices of gratitude is important to build family wellbeing. It is essential to have good and healthy communication and to find positive activities to do together among family members which can build a sense of togetherness, trust, cohesion, and happiness. Conclusion: In conclusion, the pandemic has caused unpredictable and uncertain impacts that can pose a threat to the wellbeing of the families. Pandemic has caused mental health problems such as anxiety, stress, and depression.

178142,Digital project management: rapid changes define new working environments,2021,"Pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, but not antibodies, have been detected in some unexposed individuals. This may account for some of the diversity in clinical outcomes ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe COVID-19. Although age is a risk factor for COVID-19, how age affects SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses remains unknown. We found that some pre-existing T cell responses to specific SARS-CoV-2 proteins, Spike (S) and Nucleoprotein (N), were significantly lower in elderly donors (>70 years old) who were seronegative for S than in young donors. However, substantial pre-existing T cell responses to the viral membrane (M) protein were detected in some elderly donors. These responses likely compensate for loss of T cell responses specific to S and N. In contrast, young and elderly donors exhibited comparable T cell responses to S, N, and M proteins after infection with SARS-CoV-2. M-specific responses were mediated by CD4 T cells producing interferon-gamma in both seronegative and seropositive individuals. T cells in seronegative elderly donors responded to various M-derived peptides, while the response after SARS-CoV-2 infection was apparently focused on a single peptide. These data suggest that diversity of target antigen repertoire for pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells declines with age, but the magnitude of pre-existing T cell responses is maintained by T cells reactive to specific viral proteins such as M. A better understanding of the role of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells that are less susceptible to age-related loss may contribute to development of more effective vaccines for elderly people.","Taira, N.; Toguchi, S.; Miyagi, M.; Mori, T.; Tomori, H.; Oshiro, K.; Tamai, O.; Kina, M.; Tamaki, K.; Collins, M.

The exponential increase in new cases each day calls for swift, responsive measures and rapid control at the individual, societal, and governmental levels. Lack of awareness about COVID-19 and negligence in implementation of protective measures poses a greater threat to human lives in this pandemic. There is a shortage in hospital wards as well as the absence of proper medicine for recovery. Necessary consumer products like masks and sanitizers are short in supply and unable to quench the demand. This chapter aims to present a clear and concise idea of the nature of COVID-19, its classification, and its characteristics. Classification refers to the hierarchical naming and the reason behind the protocol accepted. The characteristics refer to the nature of the virus, sources of spreading, its strengths and weaknesses, just to name a few. Causes and symptoms related to this disease are explained in detail. Modes of transmission and infection are discussed. The latest and the most accurate data and findings are listed and described. Common misconceptions and misinformation are examined, analyzed, and debunked. The after-effects and steps to take are reviewed. The preventive, as well as curative measures, are conferred. Current and future challenges are also enumerated and summarized. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Banerjee, A.; Ghosh, R.; Basak, S.; Dey, A.",Studies in Computational Intelligence,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-74761-9_1,394
178274,A Place for Space: The Shift to Online Space Education During a Global Pandemic,2021,"Objectives: To identify the specific challenges of self-isolation experienced by population sub-groups to better target and tailor support. Design: The Contact Adherence Behavioural Insights Study (CABINS) was a 15-minute telephone survey of confirmed contacts of cases of COVID-19 identified through the national NHS Wales Test Trace Protect (TTP) database. Methods: Confirmed contacts of cases of COVID-19 reached by TTP completed a 15-minute telephone survey (N = 2,027). Binary logistic regression models adjusted for age, gender, living alone, survey round, deprivation quintile (defined by the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation) and income precarity (financial security) determined which population sub-groups were more likely to experience challenges during self-isolation. Results: Younger people (aged 18-29 years) were 3 times more likely to report mental health concerns (Adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR]: 3.16, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 2.05-4.86) and 2 times more likely to report loneliness (aOR: 1.96, CI: 1.37-2.81) compared to people aged over 60 years. Women were 1.5 times more likely to experience mental health concerns (aOR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.20-1.92) compared to men. People with high/very high levels of income precarity were 8 times more likely to report financial challenges (aOR: 7.73, CI: 5.10-11.74) and 3 times more likely to report mental health concerns than their more financially secure counterparts (aOR: 3.08, CI: 2.22-4.28). Conclusions: Self-isolation is particularly challenging for those with younger people, women and precarious incomes. Providing enhanced emotional, financial and social support and signposting to these groups is required to minimise the harms of self-isolation.","Isherwood, K. R.; Kyle, R. G.; Gray, B.

178492,Three tips for creating an online course for nontraditional student populations,2021,"This paper aims to highlight the role of mutual assistance of China and Pakistan's regional connectivity through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and show what lessons can be learned by Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs). CPEC promotes trade, FDI, peace, and sustainable socio-economic development, and it can help to alleviate the effects of COVID-19 in the region to promote socio-economic development. In this study, we employed the Rolling Window Approach (Rolling Moving Average Approach) for data analysis of pre- and post-COVID-19. It also focuses on before and after the CPEC initiative's impact on the Pakistani economy through the Rolling Window Approach and graphical trends. In Pakistan, thanks to CPEC;trade, FDI, remittance, and the stock exchange (PSX) showed an upward shift. Terrorism decreased, which indicates a positive sign for peace and socio-economic development. However, currency depreciation increased, and the exchange rate trend is going up against the dollar, hurting the economy badly in several ways, such as the balance of payment, current account deficit, and lower some exports. To mitigate these issues, Pakistan and China have taken steps as trade formulated in domestic currency between China and Pakistan. During COVID-19, the provision of health care equipment on a priority basis from China helped to combat the COVID-19 effects and stabilize Pakistan's Economy. CPEC is structured to connect regional economic zones by forming local, regional, and global value chains. To cope with the COVID-19 impacts, socio-economic reforms and regional cooperation are suggested for CEECs with a pre-post circumstances review. Regional integration and cooperation are key to coping with this pandemic. CEECs can learn lessons from CPEC for socio-economic development, reducing violence, and improving the economy.","Ullah, A.; Chen, P. L.; Ullah, S.; Elahi, M.

178598,When good news backfires: Feelings of disadvantage in the Corona crisis,2021,"The Covid-19 pandemic has shaken the world. It has presented us with a series of new challenges, but the policy response may be diffi-cult due to the severe uncertainty of our circumstances. While pressure to take timely action may push towards less inclusive decision proce-dures, in this paper I argue that precisely our current uncertainty pro-vides reasons to include stakeholders in collective decision-making. Deci-sion-making during the pandemic faces uncertainty that goes beyond the standard, probabilistic one of Bayesian decision theory. Agents may be uncertain not just about factual properties of the world, but also about how to model their decision problems and about the values of the possi-ble consequences of their options. As different stakeholders may have irreconcilable disagreement about how to resolve these uncertainties, de-cision-making procedures should take everybody’s perspectives into ac-count. Moreover, those communities that are hit harder by the pandemic are also those that are typically excluded from knowledge production. Thus, in the face of Covid-19 uncertainty, both democratic and epistemic considerations highlight the importance of stakeholders’ inclusion in pol-icy decision-making. © 2021, Erasmus Journal for Philosophy and Economics.

178780,"Cluster Around Latent Variable for Vulnerability Towards Natural Hazards, Non-Natural Hazards, Social Hazards in West Papua",2021,"The process of digital transformation and teleworking are some of the most debated topics in the specialized literature of the last decade due to the major impact they have on the stability, the evolution and the efficiency of the economy. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the competitive advantage offered to the national economies by the implementation of policies dedicated to the digitalization of the society and the economy. In the last year, national economies have been faced with huge challenges imposed by the continuation and adaptation of economic processes in the virtual environment. The pace of adaptability of the workforce to digital technologies, the functional and technical literacy of human resources, the work organization and the level of digitalization influence the economic and social performance of the countries. The main aim of this research is to determine the defining characteristics in terms of the ability to adapt to telework in 30 European countries, to classify them according to their digital performance, but also to analyze their differences and determine the directions of action to capitalize on the opportunities offered by the online environment. The results of this research highlight that despite the investments which the analyzed European countries have made in recent years in digital infrastructure, there are large disparities in terms of adaptability to telework, as follows: poor adaptability (Southern and South-Eastern Europe), medium (Central Europe), high adaptability (Western and Central Europe), very high adaptability (Northern and North-Western Europe). The research is intended to be a catalyst for data-driven discussions on the adaptability of the European countries to digital innovations and the process of managing adaptation by governments to meet the economic and social needs. The analysis of the potential for adaptation to telework represents a contribution to the exploring of potential post-crisis developments. The limits of the research are related to the involvement of only six variables, the analysis can be extended in future research to other variables as well. © 2021, Amfiteatru Economic.

Extant literature, leadership preparation programs, and district policies have largely ignored principal burnout despite the increased complexity of the principalship and increasing rates of turnover. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated principal burnout given the added demands and transitions associated with school closures, reopening, and social distancing protocols. The purpose of this article is to provide a set of recommendations for district administrators and school leaders in order to reduce burnout. We hope these recommendations provide an initial starting point for taking action to reduce principal burnout.

179130,Proximity Tracing in an Ecosystem of Surveillance Capitalism,2020-09-13,"Social distancing, lockdown, and the consequent intensification of online interactions brought by Covid-19 are raising new questions for design theory and practices. The lack of physical or face-to-face interactions blocked the design activities developed in public spaces. The article aims to share a DESIS Lab experience to overcome these limitations and continue in a contactless way. Firstly, a literature review introduces the Lab's theoretical and methodological approaches;then, a process started previously to the pandemic outbreak is presented, called My Neighborhood. It happens in a neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro, called Grajaú, with face-to-face activities developed in a public square. Secondly, a new initiative prototyped after the pandemic outbreak is described. Grajaú Collab is an online mapping that identifies micro-businesses and volunteers in the neighborhood. The Lab's theoretical and methodological approaches provided the orientation and adaptability to stay with the local community under the pandemic. My Neighborhood has moved online and generates Grajaú Collab;however, both remain closely referred to the neighborhood's physical space. Online and offline modalities become two complementary sides of the same open-ended learning process and, in the future, the lab team can restart offline and face-to-face participation in the neighborhood as a continuum of the same infrastructuring process. © 2020 Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos.

Contrary to findings in existing literature, this study argues that the society-state interaction over the internet is far more dynamic and complex, and that autocratic states have the capability and resilience to manage and even control the internet. While the internet could help rally waves of public outpourings and protests, the state, in response, broadcast its tactical concessions to ease widespread public anger. However, the state has been able to portray its overall highly effective control of the epidemic, thereby claiming political credits and legitimacy for governance.","Lai, H.

Exclusion criteria were: ICMS length of stay (LoS)≤24h, terminal illness, major sensory loss and inability to communicate at the time of assessment. All participants were evaluated at ICMS scheduled telephone follow-up appointment, with Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) (depression) and EQ-5D-5L (HRQoL). Critical-illness severity was assessed with APACHE-II and SAPS-II.ResultsTwenty patients were included with a median age of 62(range: 24-77) y.o., the majority male (75%) and married (70%). Median (range) APACHE-II and SAPS-II was 17 (5-34) and 32.5 (7-77), respectively, and LoS was 18 (4-58) days. Overall, 25% patients presented depression symptoms and most reported problems on EQ-5D-5L domains of pain/discomfort (65%), anxiety/depression (55%) and mobility (50%). Depression scores were higher in patients with problems in EQ-5D-5L domains of usual activities (median 4 vs 1.5;p=0.046), pain/discomfort (median 0 vs 4;p=0.004) and anxiety/depression (median 4 vs 0;p<0.001).ConclusionsThese preliminary findings show that depression is frequent in COVID-19 survivors and it is associated with worse HRQoL. This pilot study highlights the importance of psychological assessment and treatment of COVID-19 survivors, in order to minimize its negative impact on HRQoL, optimizing their recovery.","Martins, S.; Ferreira, A.

The role of public budgeting as a political instrument is also critiqued. Design/methodology/approach: An analysis was carried out of relevant documents that included government policy statements, budgets, news articles and website information on the pandemic. Meaningful interpretation of information and reflections helped provide the basis of the commentary. Findings: Public budgeting has a prominent role in addressing a major global crisis. Budgets need to quickly respond to the needs of the moment in saving lives and sustaining people’s well-being, businesses and the economy. In a crisis situation, the social, political and economic factors become crucial determinants of budgetary policy measures. Although strong political leadership is required to deliver budgets under unimaginable circumstances, the ideology of the political party in government can be a powerful predictor of fiscal policies. Crisis budgeting will result in mounting budget deficits and public debts that will take many years for future generations to pay back. Practical implications: This paper provides a significant learning for other nations. These lessons will guide budget policymakers to prepare better for potential crisis in the future. Originality/value: This paper is original and based on the NZ Government’s budgetary response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It will be valuable in formulating budget policies and public funding decisions in a major crisis. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Narayan, A.

179399,Introduction to the First Special Issue on Pandemics,2021,"Background: TikTok is a social media platform where users create and share videos. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of this site greatly expanded. Tic and Tourette syndrome content also increased dramatically along with the number of patients with tics in neurology clinics. Objectives: We compared the phenomenology of “TikTok tics” to typical tic disorders. We chose to analyze the most widely viewed videos and therefore focused on the most popular content creators. Methods: Videos with the keywords “tic,” “Tourette,” or “tourettes” were reviewed to identify content creators between March 11, 2020 and March 30, 2021. We performed a quantitative assessment of TikTok tics as well as a descriptive analysis of the entire series of videos of each content creator. Results: The mean age of the cohort was 18.8 years old, and the majority were women. Unlike the predominance of facial movements in typical tics, arm movements were most frequent. Average tics per minute was 29, and almost all recorded TikTok tics were severe, causing significant disability. Whereas coprolalia and self-injurious behavior are only infrequently encountered in typical tic disorders, they were present in the overwhelming majority of TikTok subjects. Conclusions: TikTok tics are distinct from what is typically seen in patients with Tourette syndrome, although share many characteristics with functional tics. We believe this to be an example of mass sociogenic illness, which involves behaviors, emotions, or conditions spreading spontaneously through a group. A modern clinician needs to remain abreast of social media sources as knowledge of media content is essential in managing patients in the current environment.","Olvera, C.; Stebbins, G. T.; Goetz, C.

We use data with 28, 102 and 227 dimensions respectively to compare the mean absolute error in three cases. The results show that estimation error deceases as dimension increases, which means the higher the dimension, the better this model performs. Empirically, we measure the dependence between industrial sectors in Chinese stock market by FDG copulas. It is found that Machinery and equipment sector has the largest dependence coefficients with other sectors. In addition, by comparing the results before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, we find that the epidemic strengthened the connection between the Computer and Media industry and other industries. FDG copulas, tractable and flexible, suits well for high-dimensional estimation. Potential of its application to other fields remains to be discovered.","Cheng, Yangnan Liu Jianxu Songsak Sriboonchitta",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1978/1/012045,394

179798,COVID-19 and Black Fungus: Analysis of the Public Perception through Machine Learning,2021-07-10,"We study how by careful monitoring of the presence or absence of tidal deformability (TD) and tidal-heating (TH) in the inspiral signal of compact object binaries in ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors, one can test if its components are black holes or not. The former property (TD) is finite for neutron stars but vanishes for black holes (in general relativity), whereas the latter is finite for black holes and negligible for neutron stars, and affects the GW phase evolution of binaries in a distinctly different way. We introduce waveform parameters that characterize the strength of tidal-heating, and are zero when there is no horizon. We develop Bayesian methods that use TD and TH for distinguishing the presence or absence of horizons in a binary. This is timely owing to several claims that these stellar-mass objects, especially, with masses heavier than those of neutron stars, may not have a horizon but may be black hole mimickers or exotic compact objects (ECOs). It is also astrophysically important to have the tools to test the presence or absence of horizons in mass-gap binaries and, thereby, help detect the heaviest neutron star or the lightest black hole. A proper accounting of tidal-heating in binary waveform models will also be critical for an unbiased measurement of characteristics of the equation of state of neutron stars in GW observations of binaries containing them -- or even to probe the existence of ECOs. We show that purely based on GW waveforms it will not be possible to discern binary horizons in the mass gap in Advanced LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA detectors unless the binary is within a few tens of Mpc. However, third generation ground-based detectors will be able to do so for binaries a few hundred Mpc away.","Datta, Sayak; Phukon, Khun Sang; Bose, Sukanta",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05974v2.pdf,394

Past studies on internet use have focused on its impact on mental health, with little known about its impact on the physical health of individuals during COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, this study examines the impact of Internet use frequency on physical health during the Covid-19 lockdown in Bangladesh. Methods: A web-based cross-sectional study on several individuals was conducted last year, during the lockdown in Bangladesh. The survey covers demographics, Internet use frequency, and physical health questions. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to examine the impact of internet use frequency on physical health. Results: The result indicated that several respondents had reported headache, back pain, numbness of the fingers and neck pain, respectively. Other factors associated with physical health scores were gender, income (in Taka), occupation, regions, and working status. Conclusion: Frequent, intensive, and extensive use of the internet were strong predictors of increased physical health problems, and the study suggests the need for raising awareness of physical health problems triggered by high internet users among the high socioeconomic group in Bangladesh.","ABIR, T.

179836,Urban Nature: Does Green Infrastructure Relate to the Cultural and Creative Vitality of European Cities?,2021,"This work studied the emission changes and their economic effects during the Argentina’s COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. We have analyzed the atmospheric emissions of the main greenhouse gases (GHG: CO2, CH4, and N2O) and other pollutants (NOx, CO, NMVOC, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, and BC) from various sectors such as private road transport, freight, public transport, agriculture machines, thermal power plants, residential, commercial, and governmental from January 2005 to April 2020. We focused on the months with the greatest restrictions of COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina (March and April 2020). The results show emissions reduction up to 37% for PM10, PM2.5, and BC, consistent with observed from satellite images and up to 160% for NOx, CO, NMVOC, and SOx. However, the residential sector has increased their emissions by 8% for the same period. As a consequence, 3337 Gg of CO2eq of GHG emissions were reduced, corresponding to a 20% reduction compared to the same period in 2019. Besides, a 26% reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) was observed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results show that each Tg of GHG reduction was associated to a 0.16% reduction of the GDP from the analyzed sectors. Thus, without a voluntary reduction in consumption associated to significant cultural and technological changes, reduction in GHG would still be associated with deepening inequalities and asymmetries between high and low consumption sectors (i.e., with better (lesser) education, health, and job opportunities), even within countries and cities.","Bolaño-Ortiz, Tomás R.; Puliafito, S.

Material and methods: A questionnaire was prepared to be asked to physicians via Microsoft Forms dealing with pediatric urology for this purpose, and a link was shared in social media groups of doctors managing pediatric urology patients. Results: A total of 58 (46 males and 12 females) doctors participated in the survey. Participants stated that they made a very high rate of change in their clinical routine;the most preferred approach for the prevention in the operating room was reducing the number of the working staff, and the second most frequent was performing a preoperative COVID-19 screening. Elective surgeries (ie, inguinoscrotal pathologies) were delayed by the majority. However, the majority of the surgeons did not delay surgeries for ureteropelvic junction obstruction or urinary stones. Ninety-five percent of the participants stated that the number of patients was decreased in the outpatient clinics, which was mainly due to the hospital and government policies. The most used method to communicate with patients during the pandemic was phone calls, and there was a 52% increase in the WhatsApp messenger application before the pandemic.

180024,Komenti: A semantic text mining framework,2020-08-04,"We study the rheology of a two-fluid emulsion in semi-concentrated conditions; the solute is Newtonian while the solvent an inelastic power law fluid. The problem at hand is tackled by means of direct numerical simulations using the volume of fluid method. The analysis is performed for different volume fractions and viscosity ratios under the assumption of negligible inertia and zero buoyancy force. Several carrier fluids are considered encompassing both the shear-thinning and thickening behaviors. We show that the effective viscosity of the system increases for shear-thickening fluids and decreases for the shear-thinning ones for all the viscosity ratios considered. The changes in the emulsion viscosity are mainly due to modifications of the coalescence in the system obtained by changing the carrier fluid property: indeed, local large and low shear rates are found in the regions between two interacting droplets for shear-thickening and thinning fluids, respectively, resulting in increased and reduced local viscosity which ultimately affects the drainage time of the system. This process is independent of the nominal viscosity ratio of the two fluids and we show that it can not be understood by considering only the mean shear rate and viscosity of the two fluids across the domain, but the full spectrum of shear rate must be taken into account.","Rosti, Marco Edoardo; Takagi, Shu",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.00571v1.pdf,394
180210,Is more really better? Performance measure variety and environmental uncertainty,2021,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced people to change their lifestyles, especially with respect to restrictions on going out. Forced quarantine (i.e., lockdown) and self-restraint behavior (SRB), including self-quarantine, are suggested to induce potential negative impacts on public mental health. SRB seems to be related to governmental policies, each individual’s social background and mental condition;however, no empirical studies have been conducted. Methods: 1053 participants (mainly office workers) from epidemic areas and non-epidemic areas in Japan voluntarily conducted an online survey in June 2020. We assessed COVID-19-related aspects such as the degree of SRB, motivation for SRB, stigma, anxiety and depressive feelings due to COVID-19 by original questionnaires) and general mental health status (social anxiety by MINI-SPIN, depressive tendency by PHQ-9, depression-related personality traits by TACS-22 and resilience by TRS). Results: Regional comparison showed significant differences in SRB and social anxiety. People in epidemic areas tend to refrain from going out. Conversely, people in non-epidemic areas tend to shun the public eye. Regardless of epidemic status, proactive SRB was associated with higher motivation for SRB, higher social anxiety, higher depressive tendency, stronger COVID-19-related psychological factors and lower resilience. Moreover, people with proactive SRB in non-epidemic areas had the highest depressive tendency. Discussion: The present cross-sectional survey among office workers in Japan showed that people with proactive SRB have stronger COVID-19-related anxiety and depressive feelings, regardless of where they live. Our key finding is that people with proactive SRB in non-epidemic areas have the highest depressive tendency. Based on the present finding, we herein propose the following hypothesis: Higher levels of depressive tendency may enhance proactive SRB, which may be partly associated with higher levels of stigma, anxiety and depressive feelings related to COVID-19. Limitations: The general tendencies to avoid danger and stigma were not evaluated. Conclusions: Depressive tendency is suggested to be associated with proactive SRB against COVID-19. Intervention for depressive tendency in non-clinical settings (e.g., workplaces) may help citizens understand the infectious situation appropriately and to behave effectively during the pandemic. Further investigations should be conducted to clarify the present findings.","Katsuki, Ryoko Kubo Hiroaki Yamakawa Itsuki Shinfuku Naotaka Sartorius Norman Sakamoto Shinji Kato Takahiro A.",Psychiatry International,https://doi.org/10.3390/psychiatryint2030023,394
180231,Automated compliance checking in healthcare building design,2021,"Background: Human mastadenoviruses (HAdV) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality amongst the immunocompromised population. A recent surge in HAdV cases, including five deaths, amongst a haematopoietic stem cell transplant population led us to use whole genome sequencing (WGS) to investigate. Methods: To gain a complete transmission picture, we compared outbreak and non-outbreak sequences (54 sequences from 37 patients) with GenBank sequences and our own database of previously sequenced HAdVs (132 sequences from 37 patients). An improved bait set for WGS was used. Maximum likelihood trees and pairwise differences were used to evaluate genotypic relationships paired with epidemiological data from routine Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC) activity. Results: Nine monophyletic clusters were identified, seven of which were corroborated by epidemiological evidence and by comparison of single nucleotide polymorphisms. Two incomplete patient clusters were identified by IPC over the same time period. Of the five patients who died, one had a mixed HAdV infection and two were the source of transmission events. Conclusions: The clinical consequences of unmitigated HAdV transmission events are high. Focusing on two high risk wards using WGS we identified six transmission events, over prolonged periods, that would have gone unnoticed using traditional polymerase chain reaction and epidemiology. Mixed infection is frequent (10% of patients), providing a sentinel source of recombination and superinfection. Immunosuppressed patients harbouring a high rate of HAdV positivity require comprehensive surveillance. As a consequence of these findings, HAdV WGS is being incorporated routinely into a clinical algorithm to prevent transmission and influence IPC policy in real-time.","Myers, C. E.; Houldcroft, C.

This paper documents the stories of four precariously employed communication instructors in their transition to emergency remote teaching in March 2020. Through collaborative autoethnography, the instructors share their stories of reliance and compliance within the gig academy, using their support networks to foster resilience and create points of resistance. In the Spring 2020 semester, we experienced the same storm but with different nightmares. Technological frustrations, mental health concerns, accent barriers, financial stresses, care work, and illness were pushed to the background while we dealt with suddenly teaching online during the pandemic. The relentless uncertainty about job security hanging overhead persists. From our subaltern counterpublic, we posit a resistance to the gig academy. We urge departmental leadership to use this paper to inform policy making and practice and for other contingent instructors to expose their stories in scholarship.

Here, we show that thiol-based mucolytic agents, P2119 and P2165, potently inhibit infection by human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and decrease the binding of spike glycoprotein to its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Proteomics and reactive cysteine profiling link the antiviral activity of repurposed mucolytic agents to the reduction of key disulfides, specifically, by disruption of the Cys379–Cys432 and Cys391–Cys525 pairs distal to the receptor binding motif (RBM) in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein. Computational analyses provide insight into conformation changes that occur when these disulfides break or form, consistent with an allosteric role, and indicate that P2119/P2165 target a conserved hydrophobic binding pocket in the RBD with the benzyl thiol warhead pointed directly towards Cys432. These collective findings establish the vulnerability of human coronaviruses to repurposed thiol-based mucolytics and lay the groundwork for developing these compounds as a potential treatment, preventative and/or adjuvant against infection.","Shi, Yunlong; Zeida, Ari; Edwards, Caitlin E.; Mallory, Michael L.; Sastre, Santiago; Machado, Matías R.; Pickles, Raymond J.; Fu, Ling; Liu, Keke; Yang, Jing; Baric, Ralph S.; Boucher, Richard C.; Radi, Rafael; Carroll, Kate S.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.01.450701,394
180604,Research on the Scheduling of Tractors in the Major Epidemic to Ensure Spring Ploughing,2021,"In December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus (COVID-19), materialized in the city of Wuhan and quickly spread to form a global pandemic. An essential role in the immune system is undertaken by lymphocytes, which defend against bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. Previous study found that very severe COVID-19 patients had suppression of the immune response enabling the virus to spread and cause more damage. This was evident by the changes in their white blood cell and lymphocyte count. Early clinical findings suggest that those suffering from severe COVID-19 have reduced numbers of lymphocytes, monocytes, and other granulocytes. One of the most efficient responses for a variety of viral infections is cellular immune response activation, especially via T cells. Viruses can be eliminated by T cytotoxic (CD8+) (Tc) in the host body, these secrete a variety of molecules, including interferons (IFNs), granzyme, and perforin. T helper (CD4+) (Th) cells help by assisting cytotoxic T cells and B cells to eliminate viral infection. CD8+ and CD4+ work together in a coordinated immune response with other constituents to primarily resolve acute viral infections, and after to produce protection against any reinfection. Also, COVID-19 causes dramatic changes in cytokine profiles and serological markers. Therefore, the subsets of immune cells and the level of the pro-inflammatory cytokines are crucial evidence to determine the severity of COVID-19. The disease severity has already been proved to be associated with the disruption in the proinflammatory chemokine response, this eventually leads to a cytokine storm and progression of cytokines release syndrome (CRS). This review aimed to demonstrate a full understanding of the alterations to the immune response by determining the T-cell expression and cytokine levels against the pathological processes of COVID-19, which can be a significant step in early treatment and diagnosis of this disease, in reduction of COVID-19 mortality cases, and to emphasize the most recent and current studies to try to identify new immuno-therapeutics for COVID-19.","Tarbiah, N.

Users turn to digital transactions for fear of making physical contact when transacting. However, security issues and user convenience are obstacles to making users adopt digital payments. So, this research was made to solve the problem of adopting digital payments through the UTAUT extension model with perceived security and personal innovativeness as the main issues in the COVID-19 pandemic. This research focuses on digital payment users in Indonesia. A total of 457 users were used as research samples. The questionnaires were distributed online using a google form, after which they were processed and analyzed using SEM-PLS. This evaluation shows that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and personal innovativeness have a significant positive effect on behavioral intention to use digital banking. However, perceived security has a significant negative effect on behavioral intention. Moreover, social influence does not have a significant influence on behavioral intention. Meanwhile, Facilitating Conditions and behavioral intention have a significant positive impact on digital payment usage.

On the one side, much more was known by Autumn 2020 about the mechanisms underpinning the spread and lethality of Sars-CoV-2. On the other side, how such knowledge should be translated by policymakers into containment measures appeared to be much more controversial and debated than during the first wave in Spring. Value-laden, conflicting views in the scientific community emerged about both problem definition and subsequent solutions surrounding the epidemiological emergency, which underlined that the COVID-19 global crisis had evolved towards a full-fledged policy “wicked problem”. With the aim to make sense of the seemingly paradoxical scientific disagreement around COVID-19 public health policies, we offer an ethical analysis of the scientific views encapsulated in the Great Barrington Declaration and of the John Snow Memorandum, two scientific petitions that appeared in October 2020. We show that how evidence is interpreted and translated into polar opposite advice with respect to COVID-19 containment policies depends on a different ethical compass that leads to different prioritization decisions of ethical values and societal goals. We then highlight the need for a situated approach to public health policy, which recognizes that policies are necessarily value-laden, and need to be sensitive to context-specific and historic socio-cultural and socio-economic nuances.","Angeli, Federica Camporesi Silvia Dal Fabbro Giorgia",Humanities &amp; Social Sciences Communications,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-021-00839-1,394

This paper highlights the novel developments of this notion, including the exporters’ perspective, relevant challenges, indicators, and policies. Furthermore, we apply the portfolio theory approach to five Gulf Cooperation Council countries to construct portfolios representing the trade-offs between maximizing returns (oil export growth or export prices) and minimizing risks (standard deviation of return variables). We assess portfolios’ resilience to external demand and logistical shocks by running several disruptive scenarios. We find that oil exporters adopt a balanced approach to the risks associated with export volume growth and pricing, which is different from some major oil importers that prioritize either the physical supply or price stability. Simulation scenarios of increasing oil exports to China would have a significant impact mainly on Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), but not on the others, while scenarios of reduced oil exports to the United States would impact mainly Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. A blockade of the Malacca Strait would reduce export volumes and increase portfolio risks for all five economies, with Kuwait and Oman most affected.","Bollino, Carlo Andrea Galkin Philipp",Energies,https://doi.org/10.3390/en14144257,394
181426,China in 2020: A year of converging crises,2021,"The transport of virus-laden particles was investigated numerically in an archetypical supermarket configuration of area 1,200 m(2) and ceiling height of 4.5 m. The particles were tracked using a Lagrangian particle tracking code coupled with the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model Ansys Fluent. Air transport was assumed to occur due to indoor ventilation. Flow dynamics were simulated using the Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) approach. The movement and spreading of 5- and 20-mu m particles were studied with 0%, 25%, and 100% attachment efficiencies on surfaces in the supermarket. We found that the indoor airflows can significantly enhance the transport of particles (e.g., &gt;15 m for 5 mu m, and &gt;5 m for 20 mu m);therefore, the 6-ft (2.0 m) social distance recommended by health experts would not be sufficient to prevent the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We found that the attachment on surfaces reduces the transport of particles significantly within the supermarket, and that an attachment efficiency of 25% results in transport similar to that resulting from 100% efficiency. This suggests that the type of surfaces is not crucial in terms of air transport of particles. We support the existing approaches for reducing exposure between people through the adoption of one-way movement within an aisle. However, we also propose placing display shelves within the aisles in a staggered way to form baffles that would both increase the surface area and block the transport of airborne particles. We found that virus-laden particles could be sucked into the ventilation system through return vents, and could pose potential infection risks for the buildings connected to the same ventilation system. Hence, high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters and pleated filters with a minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) greater than 12 are recommended.

Evidence from the G7’s,2021,"This research was conducted to identify problems and improvement measures that the current residential space has by diagnosing the perception and demand for Korean dwellers. For this purpose, a questionnaire survey was conducted on 850 residents of apartment in korea aged 20 to 70. The survey consisted of the questionnaire category;household status, location, space usage behavior, preferred housing type, etc. Based on the data out of the survey, statistical analysis are conducted to find out significant pattern of respondents’ percepion and satisfaction. First, it was found that there is a correlation between the time the respondents stay in and the perception of the most important space in residential. The longer the repondents stayed in the house, the more they chose the kitchen‧dining room and living room. Secondly, satisfaction degree of residential and the influencing factors were investigated. Even though the overall satisfaction was 3.44 points in average, there was a difference in satisfaction by region. In particular, the score was lower in metropolitan areas such as Seoul, Gyeonggi, and Busan compared to Sejong City where new housing was actively supplied, which is indicating that the location the respondets live had an effect on housing satisfaction. Next, we looked at the demand for housing scale expansion. The gap between the current and desired residentaial size was the highest on 20s single-person households, which suggests that it is necessary to check that sufficient residential space is provided to young single-family households with relatively low economic efficiency. The survey also includes the spatial composition preference of the residential, showing that most prefered residentaial is the type the space is divided into 3 part;the living room, bedroom, and kitchen/dining(51.5%). Although there is a typical preferred spatial composition type across all respondents, the preferences are diverse even in the same age group and family composition. Accordingly it is necessary to reconsider the way of constructing apartment that are currently uniformly supplied by typical type.

Yet, the practical challenge of adjusting pooling designs based on infection rate has not been systematically addressed. In particular, there are both theoretical interests and practical motivation to analyze one-stage group testing at finite, practical problem sizes, rather than asymptotic ones, under noisy, rather than perfect tests, and when the number of positives is randomly distributed, rather than fixed. Here, we study noisy group testing under the probabilistic framework by modelling the infection vector as a random vector with Bernoulli entries. Our main contributions include a practical one-stage group testing protocol guided by maximizing pool entropy and a maximum-likelihood recovery algorithm under the probabilistic framework. Our findings highlight the implications of introducing randomness to the infection vectors – we find that the combinatorial structure of the pooling designs plays a less important role than the parameters such as pool size and redundancy. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Liu, Y.; Kadyan, S.; Pe’er, I.","8th International Conference on Algorithms for Computational Biology, AlCoB 2021",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-74432-8_4,394

Face sensitivity represents an essential component of social competence. This ability is aberrant in most neuropsychiatric conditions. Studies in typically developing individuals enable to develop new tools for examination and better understanding non-verbal social cognition in neuropsychiatry.ObjectivesHere we used a novel set of Face-n-Thing images to address the following issues: (i) whether the ability to seeing faces in non-face images (face pareidolia) is affected by gender;and (ii) whether it is altered with changing display orientation. The main advantage of Face-n-Thing images is that face tuning occurs without being explicitly fostered by familiar elements.MethodsA newly developed Face-n-Thing task, on which images were shown either with canonical upright orientation or inverted 180º in the image plane, was administered to healthy females and males. On each trial, they have to indicate whether they have a face impression.ResultsFace impression was substantially impeded by display inversion in both males and females. With upright display orientation, no gender differences were found, whereas with inversion, Face-n-Thing images elicited face impression in females significantly more often.ConclusionsThe findings open a way for examination of face sensitivity and underwriting brain networks in neuropsychiatric conditions, most of which are gender-specific. Display inversion represents a proper control for face tuning in neuroimaging studies.

This paper aims to present an innovative methodology to increase student awareness about the effects of economic decisions on sustainability.Design/methodology/approachThis method uses a videogame and two board games to simulate three spheres of economic interaction, namely, local, national and international. For every sphere, three key economic sectors and their relationships with fundamental sustainable development goals (SDGs) are addressed. This study uses pre- and post-simulation data to analyze the students’ perceptions regarding the usefulness of the simulations and their awareness about the effects of economic decisions on sustainability.FindingsThe implementation of this teaching and learning method demonstrated not only that active learning can effectively increase student awareness about the potential social and environmental consequences of economic decisions but also that students perceive games and simulations as useful teaching and learning tools.Social implicationsStudents in these areas need to learn not only how to transform original ideas into successful projects but also to align financial results with social and environmental objectives. The methodology presented in this research allows to enhance learning from a multi-disciplinary perspective, helping the students to analyze different economic sectors and their connection with a number of SDGs through the lens of public economics.Originality/valueThe outbreak of the COVID-19 virus has shown the effects of a global pandemic at the economic, social and environmental levels. This paper presents an innovative active learning framework to increase sustainability awareness among students of economics, business and management.","Sierra, Javier Suárez-Collado Ángela",International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education,https://doi.org/10.1108/ijshe-06-2020-0221,394
182504,BIFM: Big-Data Driven Intelligent Forecasting Model for COVID-19,2021,"Background: This study aimed to explore the lockdown experience on a sample of university students during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, focusing on the degree of confidence in the information received about the pandemic, the perceived health risk related to COVID-19, the psychological experiences related to quarantine, and the opinions regarding distance learning and the measures to adopt after the total lockdown. More specifically, we hypothesized that living in an area with more restrictions significantly contributes to accentuating the negative psychological impact of the quarantine experience. Furthermore, we assumed that a high perception of risk and a high fear of contracting the virus are significantly associated with more negative feelings during the lockdown. Conversely, adherence to pandemic containment measures and confidence in the information received on COVID-19 are predictors of positive emotions. Methods: 655 university students completed a battery of standardized questionnaires between April 22 and May 1, 2020. The data was analyzed through univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis. Results: The students showed to be highly informed about the pandemic and confident regarding the information received about the virus. Furthermore, they had a good perception of their risk of contracting COVID-19. Overall, the results highlighted a significant psychological impact of the lockdown. Students reported greater feelings of sadness (51.3%), nervousness (64.6%), and irritability (57%) than usual, with increased ruminations (70.9%). Furthermore, difficulty concentrating (55.9%), sleeping (54.5%), eating disorders (73.6%), tachycardia (65%), and a tendency to cry (65%) were also reported. Multiple regression suggests that female and younger students who lived in areas with a higher rate of contagion (""red zones"") experienced more negative feelings related to quarantine. Moreover, high levels of perceived susceptibility and less compliance with government measures were associated with negative psychological experiences. Conclusions: These results show that university students represent a vulnerable population, and specific interventions are needed to protect their psychological wellbeing during the pandemic. It would be interesting to evaluate the psychological impact of the subsequent waves of contagion due to the persistence of the pandemic's stressful event.","Commodari, E.; La Rosa, V.

To understand the evolution of this virus in humans, and to assist in tracing infection pathways and designing preventive strategies, we present a set of computational tools that span phylogenomics, population genetics and machine learning approaches. To illustrate the utility of this toolbox, we detail an in depth analysis of the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, using 329,854 high-quality consensus sequences published in the GISAID database during the pre-vaccination phase. We demonstrate that, compared to standard phylogenetic approaches, haplotype networks can be computed efficiently on much larger datasets, enabling real-time analyses. Furthermore, time series change of Tajima’s D provides a powerful metric of population expansion. Unsupervised learning techniques further highlight key steps in variant detection and facilitate the study of the role of this genomic variation in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with Multiscale PHATE methodology identifying fine-scale structure in the SARS-CoV-2 genetic data that underlies the emergence of key lineages. The computational framework presented here is useful for real-time genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 and could be applied to any pathogen that threatens the health of worldwide populations of humans and other organisms.","Mostefai, Fatima; Gamache, Isabel; Huang, Jessie; N’Guessan, Arnaud; Pelletier, Justin; Pesaranghader, Ahmad; Hamelin, David; Murall, Carmen Lia; Poujol, Raphaël; Grenier, Jean-Christophe; Smith, Martin; Caron, Etienne; Craig, Morgan; Shapiro, Jesse; Wolf, Guy; Krishnaswamy, Smita; Hussin, Julie G.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.462270,394

Adult people were invited to participate through social networks between May to June 2020. The questionnaire included sociodemographic information, coping strategies, changes in income and working conditions and psychological distress (K10 Scale).ResultsA total of 878 adults living in Bolivia answered the questionnaire. Most people considered COVID-19 as a quite/very serious health problem that affects the entire population, without distinction. 65% reported to accomplish lock down measure, however, one of the main reasons for non-compliance is the need to go out to work. Half of participants (50%) reduced worked hours and 18% modified their employment contract. However, 70% reduced household income. A considerable percentage (62%) reported psychological distress (46% with moderate or severe). It was higher in women, young people and among those with lower household income. In addition, social networks and watching series and movies were the main coping strategies reported.ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic has a considerable impact on psychological and social level. The negative impact was greater in some population groups such as women, young people, and those with a lower socioeconomic level, which may further increase inequities.","Valdés, D.; Molina, F.; Barrientos, C.; Valenzuela, P.; Basaigoitia, A.; Burrone, M.; Reginatto, G.; Leniz, I.; Solis-Soto, M.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.841,394
183046,Data-driven modeling for different stages of pandemic response,2020-09-21,"Bats host many viruses pathogenic to humans, and increasing evidence suggests that Rotavirus A (RVA) also belongs to this list. Rotaviruses cause diarrheal disease in many mammals and birds, and their segmented genomes allow them to reassort and increase their genetic diversity. Eighteen out of 2,142 bat fecal samples (0.8%) collected from Europe, Central America and Africa were PCR-positive for RVA and 11 of those were fully characterized using viral metagenomics. Upon contrasting their genomes with publicly available data, at least 7 distinct bat RVA genotype constellations (GCs) were identified, including evidence of reassortments and 6 novel genotypes. Some of these constellations are spread across the world, whereas others appear to be geographically restricted. Our analyses also suggest that several unusual human and equine RVA strains might be of bat RVA origin, based on their phylogenetic clustering, despite varying levels of nucleotide sequence identities between them. Although SA11 is one of the most widely used reference strains for RVA research and forms the backbone of a reverse genetics system, its origin remained enigmatic. Remarkably, the majority of the genotypes of SA11-like strains were shared with Gabonese bat RVAs, suggesting a potential common origin. Overall, our findings suggest an underexplored genetic diversity of RVAs in bats, which is likely only the tip of the iceberg. Increasing contact between humans and bat wildlife will further increase the zoonosis risk, which warrants closer attention to these viruses. Importance The increased research on bat coronaviruses after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoVallowed the very rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2. This is an excellent example of the importance of knowing viruses harbored by wildlife in general and bats in particular, for global preparedness against emerging viral pathogens. The current effort to characterize bat rotavirus strains from 3 continents shed light on the vast genetic diversity of rotaviruses and also hinted at a bat origin for several atypical rotaviruses in humans and animals, implying that zoonoses of bat rotaviruses might occur more frequently than currently realized.","Simsek, Ceren; Corman, Victor Max; Everling, Hermann Ulrich; Lukashev, Alexander N.; Rasche, Andrea; Maganga, Gael Darren; Binger, Tabea; Jansen, Daan; Beller, Leen; Deboutte, Ward; Gloza-Rausch, Florian; Seebens-Hoyer, Antje; Yordanov, Stoian; Sylverken, Augustina; Oppong, Samuel; Sarkodie, Yaw Adu; Vallo, Peter; Leroy, Eric M.; Bourgarel, Mathieu; Yinda, Kwe Claude; Van Ranst, Marc; Drosten, Christian; Drexler, Jan Felix; Matthijnssens, Jelle",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.13.250464,394

188157,[Modeling the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions during the corona pandemic].,2021-05-20,"Cross-reactivity with environmental antigens has been postulated as a mechanism responsible for the induction of autoimmune disease. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease model inducible in susceptible strains of laboratory animals by immunization with protein constituents of myelin. We used myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) peptide 139-151 and its analogues to define motifs to search a protein database for structural homologues of PLP139-151 and identified five peptides derived from microbial Ags that elicit immune responses that cross-react with this self peptide. Exposure of naive SJL mice to the cross-reactive environmental peptides alone was insufficient to induce autoimmune disease even when animals were treated with Ag-nonspecific stimuli (superantigen or LPS). However, immunization of SJL mice with suboptimal doses of PLP139-151 after priming with cross-reactive environmental peptides consistently induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Furthermore, T cell lines from mice immunized with cross-reactive environmental peptides and restimulated in vitro with PLP139-151 could induce disease upon transfer into naive recipients. These data suggest that expansion by self Ag is required to break the threshold to autoimmune disease in animals primed with cross-reactive peptides.","Carrizosa, A M; Nicholson, L B; Farzan, M; Southwood, S; Sette, A; Sobel, R A; Kuchroo, V K",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9759846/,394

METHODS Two different fragments S260-600 and S397-796 of the SARS-CoV S protein were expressed in Escherichia coli (E.coli) using a pET expression vector, respectively. The two recombinant proteins were separately verified by Western blot, purified by nickel-affinity chromatography, and incubated with Vero cells, a susceptible cell line of SARS-CoV infection, for cell binding assay. After the sequential probing with sera from convalescent SARS-patients and FITC-labeled anti-human IgG, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. The NIH 3T3 cell, a non-permissive cell line of SARS-CoV infection, was used as controls. RESULTS The recombinant proteins S260-600 and S397-796 were efficiently expressed in an insoluble form in E.coli. The appropriate expression of the proteins was confirmed by Western blotting using both SARS patients' sera and anti-6 x histidine antibody. The flow cytometry results showed that the both proteins were able to bind Vero cells, but the binding ability of S260-600 was somewhat stronger than that of S397-796. In contrast, the S260-600 protein did not bind NIH3T3 cells. CONCLUSION Both S260-600 and S397-796 exhibited different receptor binding activity. The S260-600 fragment probably contains the important receptor binding domain and could be a potential candidate for the development of SARS vaccine and anti-SARS therapeutics.","Wei, Hai-yan; Wang, Jian-wei; Ou, Yang-jing; Wang, Yan-bin; Qu, Jian-guo; Zhao, Wei-ming; Hong, Tao",Zhonghua shi yan he lin chuang bing du xue za zhi = Zhonghua shiyan he linchuang bingduxue zazhi = Chinese journal of experimental and clinical virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16415994/,394

197170,Innovative technology conserves resources and generates savings: a case study from the Sunnybrook Regional Processing Centre.,2009,"The interaction of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) nucleocapsid protein (N) and viral RNA was examined. Monoclonal antibody specific for N protein coimmunoprecipitated MHV genomic RNA as well as all six MHV subgenomic mRNAs found in MHV-infected cells. In contrast, monoclonal antibodies to the MHV E2 or E1 envelope glycoproteins, an anti-I-A monoclonal antibody, and serum samples from lupus patients did not immunoprecipitate the MHV mRNAs. Moreover, the anti-N monoclonal antibody did not coimmunoprecipitate vesicular stomatitis virus RNA or host cell RNA under conditions which immunoprecipitated all MHV RNAs. These data suggest a specific interaction between the N protein and the virus-specific mRNAs. Both the membrane-bound and cytosolic small MHV leader-specific RNAs of greater than 65 nucleotides long were immunoprecipitated only by anti-N monoclonal antibody. These data suggest that an N binding site is present within the leader RNA sequences at a site at least 65 nucleotides from the 5' end of genomic RNA and all six subgenomic mRNAs. The larger leader-containing RNAs originating from mRNA 1 and mRNA 6, as well as the MHV negative-stranded RNA, were also immunoprecipitated by the anti-N monoclonal antibody. These data indicate that the MHV N protein is associated with MHV-specific RNAs and RNA intermediates and may play an important functional role during MHV transcription and replication.","Baric, R S; Nelson, G W; Fleming, J O; Deans, R J; Keck, J G; Casteel, N; Stohlman, S A",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2845140/,394

MATERIALS AND METHODS Three radiologists who were blinded to the identity, diagnosis, treatment protocol, and outcome of each patient independently evaluated serial chest radiographs from 67 patients with confirmed SARS. In addition to the chest radiographic abnormalities and percentage of involvement, several quantitative improvement parameters, including the peak to 50% improvement time (PIT(50)), were collected. Correlation between PIT(50) and clinical parameters (duration of fever, cough, dyspnea, oxygen supplementation, intubation, and death) were evaluated using Wilcoxon's rank sum testing and Spearman's correlation. RESULTS The most common initial findings were unifocal air-space disease in the periphery of the lower lungs occurring a mean of 3.6 +/-2.4 (SD) days from symptoms onset. Peak abnormalities were seen at 10.4 +/- 2.9 days. PIT(50) was dependent on disease severity, showing a strong linear correlation with the clinical parameter duration of oxygen supplementation (r = 0.44, p = 0.0015). Three patterns of disease were recognized: pattern A (severe, 29.9%) with PIT(50) of more than 10 days, pattern B (typical, 44.8%) with PIT(50) of 10 or fewer days, and pattern C (mild, 25.4%) with minimal findings throughout the course of the disease. This classification was supported by collaborative clinical parameters. CONCLUSION The quantitative radiographic parameter PIT(50) has strong clinical correlation and can be used to differentiate severity of disease into severe, typical, and mild types.","Lai, Enoch K Y; Deif, Hassan; LaMere, Elizabeth A; Pham, Dieu H; Wolff, Bryan; Ward, Sarah; Mederski, Barbara; Loutfy, Mona R",AJR.

199425,Current limitations to identify COVID-19 using artificial intelligence with chest X-ray imaging,2021,"Incidence of primary and secondary liver tumors is increasing. Hepatic resection remains the treatment of choice for hepatic tumors. For various reasons the vast majority of patients with liver tumors are not suitable for resection. These patients are candidates for several image-guided focal thermal ablative therapies as alternatives to resection. Currently available ablative techniques include cryotherapy, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA), laser ablation, high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation (HIFU), and ethanol injection. Presently RFA is most widely heat-based technology used for treatment of liver malignancies due to its availability, efficacy and low complication rates. However, RFA can be time-consuming and associated with higher recurrence rates in larger lesions. MWA is a new thermal ablative technique that uses electromagnetic energy to produce coagulation necrosis. MWA has several advantages over RFA such as an improved convection profile, consistently higher intratumoral temperatures, larger ablation volumes, faster ablation times, and the option of using multiple antennae simultaneously. We report our first experience using MWA and a Coviden Valleyab 915 MHz generator for ablation of liver tumor with respect to our previous experience with RFA. Further this study reviews current literature on the RFA and MWA for the treatment of the liver malignances. In our opinion although experience is limited MWA appears to be a safe and effective technology for hepatic tumor ablation and in some cases may be superior alternative to RFA.","Stańczyk, Marek; Zegadło, Arkadiusz; Zwierowicz, Tomasz; Zak, Dariusz; Bogusławska, Romana; Maruszyński, Marek",Polski merkuriusz lekarski : organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Lekarskiego,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19606722/,394

Observational and animal studies on uses of CRP were retrieved from the PubMed database without any language restrictions. Quantitative data were not pooled because of the heterogeneity of patient characteristics and disparate ways in which CRP was studied. Serum CRP concentrations are determined by the synthetic rate of its production in the liver regulated predominantly by interleukin-6. It has a half-life of 19 hours and is relatively slow in its onset and offset in response to an acute inflammatory process when compared to procalcitonin. It has some favourable properties and limitations as an inflammatory marker An elevated CRP concentration is not specific to infections and the absolute CRP concentrations cannot be used to differentiate between bacterial, fungal and severe viral infections. The dynamic response of CRP to therapy that aims to modify the underlying inflammatory process and the clinical context of a patient are of pivotal importance when CRP concentrations are interpreted. CRP is found to be a significant partaker and prognostic factor in a wide range of cardiovascular and chronic diseases. In summary, CRP concentration is an important prognostic factor of many acute and chronic diseases. Serial CRP measurements may be useful to reflect a patient's response to therapy that aims to modify the underlying inflammatory process.","Ho, K M; Lipman, J",Anaesthesia and intensive care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19400486/,394

201744,On Adapting to Remote Learning for Healthcare Professionals,2021,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease presumably associated with chronic immune stimulation promoted by either pathogens or autoimmune processes. It has been hypothesized that MS could be the result of previous viral infections rendering a permanent immune stimulation that could be triggered by molecular similarities, or by modulating the antigens expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on target cells, which in turn act as super antigens. During immune stimulation occurs the recruitment of immunological cells, resulting in local tissue damage and leading to the release of damage- associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which also act as inflammation inducers. Recently, it has been proposed that the association between pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) with DAMPs constitutes an additional level of immune regulation. The properties of DAMPs to act as carriers of PAMPs and their role as enhancers or inhibitors of PAMPs could play a role during inflammatory responses triggered by infections. Here, we focused this review in outcomes which support the hypothesis that particular PAMP-DAMPs interactions could regulated the relapse and progressive disability observed in multiple sclerosis.","Hernández-Pedro, Norma; Magana-Maldonado, Roxana; Ramiro, Aleli Salazar; Pérez-De la Cruz, Verónica; Rangel-López, Edgar; Sotelo, Julio; Pineda, Benjamin",Frontiers in bioscience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26709893/,394

This study analyzes the critical factors influencing students' satisfaction with their continuing use of online learning management systems in higher education during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through the integration of social cognitive theory, expectation confirmation theory, and DeLone and McLean's IS success model, a survey was conducted of 181 UK students who engaged with learning management systems. It was found that, during the pandemic, service quality did not influence students' satisfaction, although both information quality and self-efficacy had significant impacts on satisfaction. In addition, the results revealed that neither self-efficacy nor satisfaction impacted personal outcome expectations, although prior experience and social influence did. The findings have practical implications for education developers, policymakers, and practitioners seeking to develop effective strategies for and improve the use of learning management systems during the pandemic.","Alzahrani, Latifa; Seth, Kavita Panwar",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),,394

However, no previous study examined the impact of the pandemic on glycemic control in patients with diabetes in countries that did not introduce a lockdown such as Japan. This study aimed to assess changes in glycemic control during the pandemic in patients with type 2 diabetes treated at a Japanese clinic. METHODS: We conducted a historical cohort study, using electronic medical records of patients with type 2 diabetes who visited our clinic between January 2019 and August 2020. Differences in HbA1c values before and after the outbreak of COVID-19 were the primary outcome, examined using the linear mixed model. RESULTS: HbA1c values significantly increased from 7.45% to 7.53% after the state of emergency was introduced (n = 1,009). Furthermore, a deterioration in HbA1c values was observed in particular among women, patients aged &#8805; 65 years, those with body mass index of &#8805; 25 kg/m2, and those that were not using insulin. CONCLUSIONS: Glycemic control deteriorated in patients with type 2 diabetes during the pandemic even in a country without a national lockdown.","Tanji, Yasuhiro; Sawada, Shojiro; Watanabe, Taichi; Mita, Takashi; Kobayashi, Yasutaka; Murakami, Takahisa; Metoki, Hirohito; Akai, Hiroaki",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,,394
204239,Human Relations virtual special issue: Flexible work practices and work-family domain,2020,"The rise of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) as well as the increase in spread of existing infections is threatening global economies and human lives, with several countries still fighting repeated onslaught of a few of these epidemics. The catastrophic impact a pandemic has on humans and economy should serve as a reminder to be better prepared to the advent of known and unknown pathogens in the future. The goal of having a set of initiatives and procedures to tackle them is the need of the hour. Rapid detection and point-of-care (POC) analysis of pathogens causing these diseases is not only a problem entailing the scientific community but also raises challenges in tailoring appropriate treatment strategies to the healthcare sector. Among the various methods used to detect pathogens, Electrochemical Biosensor Technology is at the forefront in the development of POC devices. Electrochemical Biosensors stand in good stead due to their rapid response, high sensitivity and selectivity and ease of miniaturization to name a few advantages. This review explores the innovations in electrochemical biosensing based on the various electroanalytical techniques including voltammetry, impedance, amperometry and potentiometry and discusses their potential in diagnosis of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (Re-EIDs), which are potential pandemic threats.","Menon, Shalini; Mathew, Manna Rachel; Sam, Sonia; Keerthi, K; Kumar, K Girish",J Electroanal Chem (Lausanne),,394

In this study, we gathered data from 10 community-based organizations (CBO's) in the United States that work to provide services for people experiencing homelessness. The combined CBO's span across rural, urban, and a mixture of both settings. We identified three needs that the CBO's indicated to be urgent: (1) the increased need for basic services among guests/clients, (2) new organizational challenges for the CBO's, and (3) issues related to emergency management and disasters. Among these urgent needs, respondents also indicated the need for emotional support for staff and volunteers experiencing burnout during the COVID-19 response. They also expressed some unique aspects of new care delivery systems, such as clients' willingness to engage in rehabilitation programs because of noncongregate sheltering options corresponding with those support services.","Pixley, Cotina Lane; Henry, Felicia A; DeYoung, Sarah E; Settembrino, Marc R",,,394
204284,"Book review, integrity in education for future happiness",2021,"BACKGROUND: The long-term trend analysis of esophageal cancer is rarely reported in China. Our purpose is to analyze the incidence and mortality trends of esophageal cancer in China from 2005 to 2015. METHOD: Based on the data in the annual report of the China Cancer Registry, a comprehensive analysis of esophageal cancer cases and deaths from 2005 to 2015 was carried out. The incidence and mortality of esophageal cancer are stratified by gender and region (urban or rural). Long-term trend analysis was conducted using Joinpoint regression model. RESULT: In China, the age-standardized incidence rates by the world population declined from 13.84/105 in 2005 to 11.64/105 in 2015. Annual percent changes were 3.4% (95% CI: 0.6%, 6.3%) in the period 2005-2011, -7.4% (95% CI: -10.1%, -4.7%) in the period 2011-2015, respectively. The age-standardized mortality rates declined from 10.86/105 in 2005 to 8.57/105 in 2015. And the average annual percent change was -4.1% (95% CI: -6.7%, -1.5%). The incidence and mortality of esophageal cancer in men are higher than those in women, and the incidence and mortality of esophageal cancer in rural areas are much higher than those in urban areas. CONCLUSION: In China, the incidence of esophageal cancer first increased and then decreased during 2005-2015, while the mortality rate has been declining.","He, Feifan; Wang, Junyi; Liu, Li; Qin, Xiaoyue; Wan, Zhanyong; Li, Wei; Ping, Zhiguang",Cancer med,,394
204285,"Book review, integrity in education for future happiness",2021,"We report on the results of a measurement study carried out on a commuter bus in Dublin, Ireland using the Google/Apple Exposure Notification (GAEN) API. This API is likely to be widely used by Covid-19 contact tracing apps. Measurements were collected between 60 pairs of handset locations and are publicly available. We find that the attenuation level reported by the GAEN API need not increase with distance between handsets, consistent with there being a complex radio environment inside a bus caused by the metal-rich environment. Changing the people holding a pair of handsets, with the location of the handsets otherwise remaining unchanged, can cause variations of +/-10dB in the attenuation level reported by the GAEN API. Applying the rule used by the Swiss Covid-19 contact tracing app to trigger an exposure notification to our bus measurements we find that no exposure notifications would have been triggered despite the fact that all pairs of handsets were within 2m of one another for at least 15 mins. Applying an alternative threshold-based exposure notification rule can somewhat improve performance to a detection rate of 5% when an exposure duration threshold of 15 minutes is used, increasing to 8% when the exposure duration threshold is reduced to 10 mins. Stratifying the data by distance between pairs of handsets indicates that there is only a weak dependence of detection rate on distance.","Leith, Douglas J.; Farrell, Stephen",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.08543v1.pdf,394

Extending ICU capacity can be limited by the lack of air and oxygen pressure sources available. Transport ventilators requiring only one O2 source may be used in such places. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performances of four transport ventilators and an ICU ventilator in simulated severe respiratory conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two pneumatic transport ventilators, (Oxylog 3000, Draeger; Osiris 3, Air Liquide Medical Systems), two turbine transport ventilators (Elisee 350, ResMed; Monnal T60, Air Liquide Medical Systems) and an ICU ventilator (Engström Carestation-GE Healthcare) were evaluated on a Michigan test lung. We tested each ventilator with different set volumes (Vtset = 350, 450, 550 ml) and compliances (20 or 50 ml/cmH2O) and a resistance of 15 cmH2O/l/s based on values described in COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Volume error (percentage of Vtset) with P0.1 of 4 cmH2O and trigger delay during assist-control ventilation simulating spontaneous breathing activity with P0.1 of 4 cmH2O and 8 cmH2O were measured. RESULTS: Grouping all conditions, the volume error was 2.9 ± 2.2% for Engström Carestation; 3.6 ± 3.9% for Osiris 3; 2.5 ± 2.1% for Oxylog 3000; 5.4 ± 2.7% for Monnal T60 and 8.8 ± 4.8% for Elisee 350. Grouping all conditions (P0.1 of 4 cmH2O and 8 cmH2O), trigger delay was 50 ± 11 ms, 71 ± 8 ms, 132 ± 22 ms, 60 ± 12 and 67 ± 6 ms for Engström Carestation, Osiris 3, Oxylog 3000, Monnal T60 and Elisee 350, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In surge situations such as COVID-19 pandemic, transport ventilators may be used to accurately control delivered volumes in locations, where only oxygen pressure supply is available. Performances regarding triggering function are acceptable for three out of the four transport ventilators tested.","Savary, Dominique; Lesimple, Arnaud; Beloncle, François; Morin, François; Templier, François; Broc, Alexandre; Brochard, Laurent; Richard, Jean-Christophe; Mercat, Alain",Ann Intensive Care,,394

Acute-phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells displayed a highly activated cytotoxic phenotype that correlated with various clinical markers of disease severity, whereas convalescent-phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were polyfunctional and displayed a stem-like memory phenotype. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were detectable in antibody-seronegative exposed family members and convalescent individuals with a history of asymptomatic and mild COVID-19.

RESULTS: A total of 45 interviews, lasting between 39 and 74 minutes each, were conducted involving 18 dentists (6 females), 12 dental hygienists (11 females), 6 certified dental assistants (all females), and 9 administrators/front-desk staff (7 females). Fifty-one hours of audio recordings and more than 650 single-spaced pages of transcripts were produced. Five main themes emerged pertaining to uncertainties surrounding COVID-19, patient care, personal lives and infectiousness, concern for the future, and variations among different pandemics. Certitudes were less evident, but surfaced mostly when considering a potential new normal resulting from the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Participants indicated that the uncertainties they felt were dependent upon what is known, and unknown, about the pandemic and the provision of oral health care during the first wave of infections. Future studies are needed to include the viewpoints of oral health care workers from other provinces, as well the perceptions of patients who received oral health care during the height of the first wave of the pandemic.","Brondani, Mario; Almeida, Fernanda; Cua, Denise; Maragha, Tala; Mathu-Muju, Kavita; Shayanfar, Melody; von Bergmann, HsingChi; Donnelly, Leeann",PLoS One,,394

Bavaria had to deal with more severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections than any other German state during the first wave and currently has over 270,000 cases, accounting for about one fifth of all COVID-19 cases in Germany. The Bavarian Ministry of Interior together with the Bavarian Sate Ministry of Health and Care issued a general ruling at the beginning of the first wave that ordered the centralised organisation of hospital capacity, a redesign of the information technology (IT) management system and introduced reporting obligations for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. The goal of this analysis was to investigate the role that university hospitals played in the inpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of all inpatient COVID-19 cases that were reported through the ""IVENA Sonderlage"" (Ivena eHEALTH, [IVENA, interdisziplinärer Versorgungsnachweis, mainis IT-Service GmbH, Offenbach am Main, Germany]), a special module for the ""Interdisciplinary Medical Care Capacity Management System"" designed for extraordinary events and circumstances, was conducted by analysing the number of reported treatment days of all Bavarian hospitals that participated in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: During the first wave university hospitals provided relevant scientific contributions and played an important role in advising physicians, hospitals and politicians on the pandemic. In all, 20% of intensive care unit (ICU) and intermediate care (IMC) treatment days were provided by the university hospitals in particular for treatment of complex courses of COVID-19.","Dommasch, M; Zimmermann, M; Kanz, K-G; Spinner, C D",Med.

212203,Secure data communication IoT and wireless sensor network for COVID-19,2021,"The global environment is being constantly degraded, placing humans at increased risk for outbreaks of infectious diseases. In this regard, environmental quality must be enhanced in order to prevent pandemics in the future. However, it is unknown whether future environmental experts are aware of the intricate relationship between environmental degradation and infectious diseases. This question is important because if they lack awareness about this relationship, they may not be able to contribute to biodiversity conservation which, in turn, can prevent outbreaks of infectious diseases. Hence, the aim of this paper is to investigate the attitudes of environmental students towards the pandemic. The primary objective is to examine their views on the origin of COVID-19 and a secondary objective is to discover the factors that affect the endorsement of conspiracy and non-conspiracy theories on the origin of COVID-19. Our findings indicated that an alarmingly high percentage of students endorsed the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 is a man-made virus for which there was a vaccine before it emerged, whereas only one in five students perceived that the virus is associated with climate change. These students are the future scientists who will be responsible for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation. Therefore, it is necessary to pay more attention to environmental students, both in Greece and elsewhere, and examine if such perceptions stem from any deficiencies in curricula or from the effects of the media.","Tsantopoulos, Georgios Papageorgiou Aristotelis C.; Karasmanaki, Evangelia",Sustainability,,394
213069,Innovation and entrepreneurship amidist coronavirus: a hybrid innovation network response,2021,"Fake news, false or misleading information presented as news, has a great impact on many aspects of society, such as politics and healthcare. To handle this emerging problem, many fake news detection methods have been proposed, applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques on the article text. Considering that even people cannot easily distinguish fake news by news content, these text-based solutions are insufficient. To further improve fake news detection, researchers suggested graph-based solutions, utilizing the social context information such as user engagement or publishers information. However, existing graph-based methods still suffer from the following four major drawbacks: 1) expensive computational cost due to a large number of user nodes in the graph, 2) the error in sub-tasks, such as textual encoding or stance detection, 3) loss of rich social context due to homogeneous representation of news graphs, and 4) the absence of temporal information utilization. In order to overcome the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel social context aware fake news detection method, Hetero-SCAN, based on a heterogeneous graph neural network. Hetero-SCAN learns the news representation from the heterogeneous graph of news in an end-to-end manner. We demonstrate that Hetero-SCAN yields significant improvement over state-of-the-art text-based and graph-based fake news detection methods in terms of performance and efficiency.","Cui, Jian; Kim, Kwanwoo; Na, Seung Ho; Shin, Seungwon",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.08022v1.pdf,394

Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was used for typing of BoLA-A exon 2-3 with DdeI and TaqI restriction enzymes; and exon 4-5 with HinfI in 45 crossbred calves. The PCR-RFLP analysis revealed five BoLA-A alleles each for exon 2-3 (A10/A19, A19, A18/19, A18 and A31) and exon 4-5 (A, B, C, D and E). Immune response against B. abortus S19 was assessed at the 4th week post vaccination; antibody response by standard tube agglutination test (STAT) and cell-mediated immunity by lymphocyte proliferation and lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity assays. Further, the macrophage function in terms of nitrite production was also analyzed. The association analysis of various BoLA-A alleles with the elicitation of immune response revealed that calves with certain defined genotypes induced significantly higher cell-mediated immune response in terms of lymphocyte proliferation with higher stimulation indices (S.I.) of 1.59 (BoLA-A19), 1.49 (A18/19) and 1.52 (HinfI-D); lymphocyte mediated cytotoxicity (55.52 % in A19) and nitrite production (43.40 µM in A31). It is assumed that allelic variants of BoLA-A (exons 2-3 and 4-5) were associated with the differential immune response of calves to B. abortus S19 vaccination. Therefore, further studies on association analysis of MHC class-I genes in large number of cattle may generate more information and might be useful for adapting the alternative approach of exploring genetic resistance in the cattle herd against bovine brucellosis.","Patra, Biswanath; Panigrahi, Manjit; Ahmad, Sheikh Firdous; Dandapat, Satyabrata; Kumar, Pushpendra; Bhushan, Bharat",Vet Microbiol,,394

We present the characteristics and outcomes of patients treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) with immunosuppressive drugs, either tocilizumab or anakinra compared with controls. METHODS: A Single-center observational prospective study on ICU invasively ventilated COVID-19 patients. The primary outcome was the clinical improvement at day 28. A Bayesian framework was employed and all analyses were adjusted for confounders. RESULTS: Sixty-one consecutive invasively ventilated patients were included, nine (14â7%) received tocilizumab and 15 (24â6%) received anakinra. Over the first seven days, tocilizumab was associated with a greater decrease in C-reactive protein (p<0â001). After adjusting for confounders, the probability of clinical improvement at day 28 compared to control was 7â6% (OR, 0â36 [95% CrI, 0â09-1â46]) for tocilizumab and 40â9% (OR, 0â89 [95% CrI, 0â32-2â43]) for anakinra.

216695,Data Analytics: COVID-19 Prediction Using Multimodal Data,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is one of the RNA coronaviruses which share the highest mutation rates of RNA viruses when compared with that of their hosts. The collective mutation rate of RNA viruses is up to a million times higher than their hosts and is correlated with enhanced virulence of viruses. The RNA, genomic material of SARS-CoV-2, has the capacity of showing amplified fast changes as the infection spreads. These changes were frequently observed in genes for spike glycoprotein, nucleocapsid, ORF1ab, and ORF8, together with RNA dependent RNA polymerase. In contrast, genes for envelope, membrane, ORF6, ORF7a and ORF7b showed no observable changes in terms of amino acid substitutions. Mutated SARS COV-2 at these particular sites has been associated with viral infectivity, false laboratory results and viral genome mutation and interferes with therapeutic targets. Interferences with therapeutic targets is frequently observed in genes for RdRp. Additionally, mutated viral genes for RdRp render slow fidelity of RdRp protein, resulting in a high mutation rate. Such a high mutation rate might allow new virulent forms of the virus to emerge and influence the disease profile. This review aimed to elaborate on the effect of genomic and amino acid sequence mutations on the virulence and therapeutic targets of SARS COV-2. To achieve this objective, multiple literatures have been reviewed.","Kelta Wabalo, E.; Dukessa Dubiwak, A.; Welde Senbetu, M.; Sime Gizaw, T.",Infection &amp; Drug Resistance,,394

Design an automatic pest recognition system is necessary because manual recognition is slow, time-consuming, and expensive. The Image-based pest classifier using the traditional computer vision method is not efficient due to the complexity. Insect pest classification is a difficult task because of various kinds, scales, shapes, complex backgrounds in the field, and high appearance similarity among insect species. With the rapid development of deep learning technology, the CNN-based method is the best way to develop a fast and accurate insect pest classifier. We present different convolutional neural network-based models in this work, including attention, feature pyramid, and fine-grained models. We evaluate our methods on two public datasets: the large-scale insect pest dataset, the IP102 benchmark dataset, and a smaller dataset, namely D0 in terms of the macro-average precision (MPre), the macro-average recall (MRec), the macro-average F1- score (MF1), the accuracy (Acc), and the geometric mean (GM). The experimental results show that combining these convolutional neural network-based models can better perform than the state-of-the-art methods on these two datasets. For instance, the highest accuracy we obtained on IP102 and D0 is $74.13\%$ and $99.78\%$, respectively, bypassing the corresponding state-of-the-art accuracy: $67.1\%$ (IP102) and $98.8\%$ (D0).

Few studies have examined these emerging disparities using indicators of SDOH. Objective: To evaluate predictors of COVID-19 test positivity, morbidity, and mortality and their implications for inequalities in SDOH and for future policies and health care improvements. Design, Setting, and Participants: A cross sectional analysis was performed on all patients tested for COVID-19 on the basis of symptoms with either a history of travel to at risk regions or close contact with a confirmed case, across the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) up until April 26th 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was death from COVID-19 and secondary outcomes were test positivity, and morbidity (e.g., hospitalization and intubation caused by COVID-19). Results: Of 20,899 tested patients, 8,928 tested positive, 1,701 were hospitalized, 684 were intubated, and 1,179 died from COVID-19.

To explore potential natural therapeutics, 213 important phytochemicals of nine medicinal plants Aconitum heterophyllum, Cassia angustifolia, Cymbopogon fl exuosus, Cymbopogon martinii, Nux vomica, Phyllanthus urinaria, Swertia chirayita, Justicia adhatoda, Vetiveria zizanioides were selected for in-silico molecular docking against the spike protein of SARS-COV-2 and compared with recently prescribed drug chloroquine, ramdesivir, lopinavir and hydroxychloroquine. Results revealed that rhamnocitrin of P. urinaria, 1,5-dihydroxy-3,8-dimethoxyxanthone of S. chirayita and laevojunenol of V. zizanioides potentially binds with the receptor binding site of SARS-COV-2 spike glycoprotein and more robustly destabilized the RBD-ACE-2 binding over chloroquine, ramdesivir, lopinavir and hydroxychloroquine. It was also found that laevojunenol, rhamnocitrin, and 1,5-dihydroxy-3,8-dimethoxyxanthone qualifi ed the criteria for drug-likeness as per Lipinski rule. After attachment of the selected phytochemical with the spike protein the affi nity of the later towards ACE-2 was minimized and the eff ect of 1,5-dihydroxy-3,8- dimethoxyxanthone and laevojunenol was superior. Hence, rhamnocitrin of P. urinaria, 1,5-dihydroxy-3,8-dimethoxyxanthone of S. chirayita and laevojunenol of V. zizanioides, are potential therapeutic molecules for SARS-COV-2, which upon binding with spike protein changes the affi nity of the spike towards ACE-2 and therefore restrict the entry of the virus into a human cell. Subsequent clinical validation is needed to confi rm these phytochemicals as drugs to combat COVID-19.","Santra, S.; Das, S. G.; Halder, S. K.; Ghosh, K.; Banerjee, A.; Panda, A. K.; Mondal, K.

220194,Economic activities for repatriated migrant workers of india: A framework for rural development,2020,"Severe contagious respiratory disease-COVID-19-caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, can lead to fatal respiratory failure associated with an excessive inflammatory response. Infiltration and spread of SARS-CoV-2 are based on the interaction between the virus' structural protein S and the cell's receptor-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with the simultaneous involvement of human trans-membrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Many scientific reports stress the importance of elevated recruitment and activity of neutrophils, which can form extracellular neutrophil traps (NETs) playing a significant role in the mechanism of combating pathogens, in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Excessive generation of NETs during prolonged periods of inflammation predisposes for the occurrence of undesirable reactions including thromboembolic complications and damage to surrounding tissues and organs. Within the present manuscript, we draw attention to the impact of NET generation on the severe course of COVID-19 in patients with concurrent cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Additionally, we indicate the necessity to explore not only the cellular but also the molecular bases of COVID-19 pathogenesis, which may aid the development of dedicated therapies meant to improve chances for the successful treatment of patients. We also present new directions of research into medications that display NETs formation regulatory properties as potential significant therapeutic strategies in the progress of COVID-19.","Janiuk, Karolina; Jablonska, Ewa; Garley, Marzena",,,394

223943,COVID-19: A Crisis of Borders,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Since the introduction of the UK's National Early Warning Score (NEWS) and its modification, NEWS2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has caused a worldwide pandemic. NEWS and NEWS2 have good predictive abilities in patients with other infections and sepsis, however there is little evidence of their performance in COVID-19. METHODS: Using receiver-operating characteristics analyses, we used the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve to evaluate the performance of NEWS or NEWS2 to discriminate the combined outcome of either death or intensive care unit (ICU) admission within 24â¯h of a vital sign set in five cohorts (COVID-19 POSITIVE, nâ¯=â¯405; COVID-19 NOT DETECTED, nâ¯=â¯1716; COVID-19 NOT TESTED, nâ¯=â¯2686; CONTROL 2018, nâ¯=â¯6273; CONTROL 2019, nâ¯=â¯6523). RESULTS: The AUROC values for NEWS or NEWS2 for the combined outcome were: COVID-19 POSITIVE, 0.882 (0.868-0.895); COVID-19 NOT DETECTED, 0.875 (0.861-0.89); COVID-19 NOT TESTED, 0.876 (0.85-0.902); CONTROL 2018, 0.894 (0.884-0.904); CONTROL 2019, 0.842 (0.829-0.855). CONCLUSIONS: The finding that NEWS or NEWS2 performance was good and similar in all five cohorts (rangeâ¯=â¯0.842-0.894) suggests that amendments to NEWS or NEWS2, such as the addition of new covariates or the need to change the weighting of existing parameters, are unnecessary when evaluating patients with COVID-19. Our results support the national and international recommendations for the use of NEWS or NEWS2 for the assessment of acute-illness severity in patients with COVID-19.","Kostakis, Ina; Smith, Gary B; Prytherch, David; Meredith, Paul; Price, Connor; Chauhan, Anoop",Resuscitation,,394

Accordingly, we defined a transformation factor to convert level of tobacco smoke exposure and impact biomarkers from different biometrics. METHODS: We examined smoking topography of recruited volunteers using a self-reporting survey. The level of tobacco smoke exposure and impact biomarkers in subjects' urine and blood were analysed. Results were used to assess the correlations between the topography survey items with biomarkers in biological matrices. The relationship between the biomarkers in urine and blood was analysed. Accordingly, we defined a transformation factor as the ratio of different biomarkers in urine and blood matrices. RESULTS: Significant correlations among smoking topography variables and biomarkers were found. Besides, a strong significant association was found among urine and blood cotinine (&#961; = 0.817) and NMR (&#961; = 0.905). Urine vs blood cotinine and NMR transformation factors were calculated to be 6.17 L-Blood/g-Creatinine and 10.2, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The validated transformation factor connects epidemiological cohort studies with tobacco smoking exposure risk assessment. Hence, this study might be beneficial for further habit-based smoking risk assessments to obtain successful regional cession policies.","Yang, Jiyeon; Hashemi, Shervin; Han, Wonseok; Lee, Chaelin; Kang, Younseok; Lim, Youngwook",Biomarkers,,394

227285,Pandemic Parliaments: Canadian Legislatures in a Time of Crisis,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate stress effect of COVID-19 pandemic and Zagreb earthquakes on symptoms of temporomandibular disorders (TMD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and two previously diagnosed TMD patients were contacted by email to participate in an online survey about impact of those events on current and/or new symptoms, perceived stress, anxiety and symptom intensity in time-points at the baseline, following pandemic and following earthquake. We compared data between earthquake-affected and non-affected respondents. RESULTS: Response rate was 79.4%. Effects stress had on deterioration of symptoms were significantly different between earthquake-affected and non-affected (p = .024). In earthquake-affected, numerical pain rating scale (NPRS) scores significantly increased between baseline and after COVID-19 (p > .001) and between baseline and after earthquakes (p > .05). However, scores insignificantly dropped from COVID-19 to after earthquakes time-points. In earthquake-affected, positive correlation was found between impact of COVID-19 on stress and NPRS (p < .001) and between earthquakes' impact on stress and NPRS (p < .001). Earthquake-affected respondents reported significantly more new behavioral habits when compared to non-affected (p = .048). CONCLUSIONS: A series of stressful events do not necessarily have a cumulative effect, but are likely to have a complex interaction (e.g., acute stress might trigger the protective mechanisms), which could have decreased pain scores after the earthquakes.","Vrbanovic, Ema; Alajbeg, Iva Z; Alajbeg, Ivan",Oral dis,,394

228818,The Limits of Human Rights Limits,2021,"An analytic evaluation of the peak time of a disease allows for the installment of effective epidemic precautions. Recently, an explicit analytic, approximate expression (MT) for the peak time of the fraction of infected persons during an outbreak within the susceptible-infectious-recovered/removed (SIR) model had been presented and discussed (Turkyilmazoglu, 2021). There are three existing approximate solutions (SK-I, SK-II, and CG) of the semi-time SIR model in its reduced formulation that allow one to come up with different explicit expressions for the peak time of the infected compartment (Schlickeiser and Kröger, 2021; Carvalho and Gonçalves, 2021). Here we compare the four expressions for any choice of SIR model parameters and find that SK-I, SK-II and CG are more accurate than MT as long as the amount of population to which the SIR model is applied exceeds hundred by far (countries, ss, cities). For small populations with less than hundreds of individuals (families, small towns), however, the approximant MT outperforms the other approximants. To be able to compare the various approaches, we clarify the equivalence between the four-parametric dimensional SIR equations and their two-dimensional dimensionless analogue. Using Covid-19 data from various countries and sources we identify the relevant regime within the parameter space of the SIR model.","Kröger, Martin; Turkyilmazoglu, Mustafa; Schlickeiser, Reinhard",Physica D,,394

In a few weeks, it progressed rapidly into a global pandemic which resulted in an overwhelming burden on health care systems, medical resources and staff. Spine surgeons as health care providers are no exception. In this study, we try to highlight the impact of the crisis on spine surgeons in terms of knowledge, attitude, practice and socioeconomic burden. METHODS: This was global, multicentric cross-sectional study on 781 spine surgeons that utilized an Internet-based validated questionnaire to evaluate knowledge about COVID-19, availability of personal protective equipment, future perceptions, effect of this crisis on practice and psychological distress. Univariate and multivariate ordinal logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the predictors for the degree of COVID-19 effect on practice. RESULTS: Overall, 20.2%, 52% and 27.8% of the participants were affected minimally, intermediately and hugely by COVID-19, respectively. Older ages (ß = 0.33, 95% CI 0.11-0.56), orthopedic spine surgeons (ß = 0.30, 95% CI 0.01-0.61) and those who work in the private sector (ß = 0.05, 95% CI 0.19-0.61) were the most affected by COVID-19. Those who work in university hospitals (ß = - 0.36, 95% CI 0.00 to - 0.71) were affected the least. The availability of N95 masks (47%) and disposable eye protectors or face shields (39.4%) was significantly associated with lower psychological stress (p = 0.01). Only 6.9%, 3.7% and 5% had mild, moderate and severe mental distress, respectively. CONCLUSION: While it is important to recognize the short-term impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the practice of spine surgery, predicting where we will be standing in 6-12 months remains difficult and unknown. The COVID-19 crisis will probably have an unexpected long-term impact on lives and economies.","Khattab, Mohamed Fawzy; Kannan, Tareq M A; Morsi, Ahmed; Al-Sabbagh, Qussay; Hadidi, Fadi; Al-Sabbagh, Mohammed Qussay; M Taha, Muzahem; Bourghli, Anouar; Obeid, Ibrahim",Eur. spine j,,394

Appropriate steps that facilitate defining of cases, carrying out accurate clinical diagnoses, and forming a powerful health surveillance that addresses public health policies and procedures are necessary. Tracking the number of COVID-19 cases over time and flattening the curve is another important element to establish research settings and identify therapeutic components to expedite and develop effective interventions. Addressing the various sections of the society in a philanthropic way is crucial to acquiring the public cooperation that is essential to controlling a disease like COVID-19. In this study, we discuss various strategies and measures adopted by Kerala, an Indian state, to combat the COVID-19 outbreak. Regular and timely updates by government public relations and health departments were used in many of the adopted strategies. The engagement of health information systems, together with the application of decentralized governance and community engagement, has contributed to effective population health management and surveillance of the pandemic.","Mustafa, Sabeena; Jayadev, Anishia; Madhavan, Maya",Int J Health Serv,,394

AIMS: To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a pilot multifactorial intervention to reduce potentially inappropriate medication (PIM) use in older adults. METHODS: We conducted a phase 2, feasibility, open-label study in the ambulatory setting of an integrated healthcare network in Buenos Aires, Argentina. We recruited primary care physicians (PCPs) and measured PIM use in a sample of their patients (65 years or older). Educational workshops for PCPs were organized with the involvement of clinician champions. Practical deprescribing algorithms were designed based on Beers criteria. Automatic email alerts based on specific PIMs recorded in each patient's electronic health record were used as a reminder tool. PCPs were responsible for deprescribing decisions. We randomly sampled 879 patients taking PIMs from eight of the most commonly used drug classes at our institution and compared basal (6 months prior to the intervention) and final (12 months after) prevalence of PIM use using a test of proportions. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in all drug classes evaluated. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (basal prevalence 5.92%; final 1.59%); benzodiazepines (10.13%; 6.94%); histamine antagonists (7.74%; 3.07%); opioids (2.16%; 1.25%); tricyclic antidepressants (8.08%; 4.10%); muscle relaxants (7.74%; 3.41%), anti-hypertensives (3.53%; 1.82%) and oxybutynin (2.96%; 1.82%). The absolute reduction in the overall prevalence was 8.5 percentage points (relative reduction of 51.4%). CONCLUSION: This multifactorial intervention is feasible and effective in reducing the use of potentially inappropriate medication in all drug classes evaluated.","Schapira, Marcelo; Calabró, Pablo; Montero-Odasso, Manuel; Osman, Abdelhady; Guajardo, María Elena; Martínez, Bernardo; Pollán, Javier; Cámera, Luis; Sassano, Miguel; Perman, Gastón",Aging clin. exp. res,,394

Compelling evidence has shown the involvement of IL-17A in lung injury, while its contribution to PM2.5-induced lung injury remains largely unknown. Here, we probed into the possible role of IL-17A in mouse models of PM2.5-induced lung injury. Mice were instilled with PM2.5 to construct a lung injury model. Flow cytometry was carried out to isolate Î³Î´T and Th17 cells. ELISA was adopted to detect the expression of inflammatory factors in the supernatant of lavage fluid. Primary bronchial epithelial cells (mBECs) were extracted, and the expression of TGF signalling pathway-, autophagy- and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway-related proteins in mBECs was detected by immunofluorescence assay and Western blot analysis. The mitochondrial function was also evaluated. PM2.5 aggravated the inflammatory response through enhancing the secretion of IL-17A by Î³Î´T/Th17 cells. Meanwhile, PM2.5 activated the TGF signalling pathway and induced EMT progression in bronchial epithelial cells, thereby contributing to pulmonary fibrosis. Besides, PM2.5 suppressed autophagy of bronchial epithelial cells by up-regulating IL-17A, which in turn activated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway. Furthermore, IL-17A impaired the energy metabolism of airway epithelial cells in the PM2.5-induced models. This study suggested that PM2.5 could inhibit autophagy of bronchial epithelial cells and promote pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis by inducing the secretion of IL-17A in Î³Î´T and Th17 cells and regulating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway.","Cong, Lu-Hong; Li, Tao; Wang, Hui; Wu, Yi-Na; Wang, Shu-Peng; Zhao, Yu-Yue; Zhang, Guo-Qiang; Duan, Jun",J Cell Mol Med,,394
232666,Inequality and the Economic Cycle: Disabled Employees’ Experience of Work during the Great Recession in Britain,2020,"OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to investigate the antimicrobial properties, compressive strength and fluoride release capacities of high-viscous glass ionomer cements (GICs) after incorporation of cinnamon and thyme essential oils. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experimental-modified GICs were prepared by incorporation of thyme and cinnamon essential oils into the liquid phase of the cement at 5 and 10% v/v. Antimicrobial activity against selected microorganisms (Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans) was done using direct contact test. Compressive strength of the four new formulations and control group was tested using a universal testing machine while fluoride ion release was measured by ion-selective electrode at 1, 7, 14 and 28 days. Data analysis and comparisons between groups were performed using factorial and one-way ANOVA and Tukey's tests. RESULTS: All newly formulated GICs exhibited significantly higher inhibitory effects against both Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans growth when compared to conventional GIC (p < 0.05). Compressive strength of 5% cinnamon-modified GIC (MPa = 160.32 ± 6.66) showed no significant difference when compared with conventional GIC (MPa = 165.7 ± 5.769) (p value > 0.05). Cumulative fluoride-releasing pattern at days 7, 14, and 28 were 10% cinnamon-GIC > 5% thyme-GIC > 5% cinnamon-GIC > 10% thyme GIC > conventional GIC. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporation of 5% cinnamon oil into glass ionomer resulted in better antimicrobial effects against S. mutans and C. albicans and increased fluoride-release capacity without jeopardizing its compressive strength. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The 5% cinnamon-modified GIC appears to be a promising alternative restorative material in ART technique.","Sherief, Dalia I; Fathi, Marwa S; Abou El Fadl, Reham K",,,394

We explain that there are four broad but easily identifiable systemic, pathologically networked conditions that are hurtling civilization toward potential self-destruction. As long as these conditions are not resolved, we should consider catastrophe as an inevitable emergent endpoint from the dynamics. All four conditions can be reversed with collective action to begin creating an enduring and thriving post- COVID-19 world.

The transcription factor nuclear factor-&#954;B (NF-&#954;B) modulates the functions of the immune cells and alters the gene expression profile of different cytokines in response to various pathogenic stimuli, while many proinflammatory factors have been known to induce NF-&#954;B signalling cascade. Besides, NF-&#954;B has been known to potentiate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to apoptosis in various tissues in many diseases and viral infections. Though the reports on the involvement of the NF-&#954;B signalling pathway in COVID-19 are limited, the therapeutic benefits of NF-&#954;B inhibitors including dexamethasone, a synthetic form of glucocorticoid, have increasingly been realized. Considering the fact, the abnormal activation of the NF-&#954;B resulting from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection might be associated with the pathogenic profile of immune cells, cytokine storm and multiorgan defects. Thus, the pharmacological inactivation of the NF-&#954;B signalling pathway can strongly represent a potential therapeutic target to treat the symptomatology of COVID-19. This article signifies pharmacological blockade of the phosphorylation of inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase subunit beta (IKKß), a key downstream effector of NF-&#954;B signalling, for a therapeutic consideration to attenuate COVID-19.","Kandasamy, Mahesh",Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol,,394

The present study was aimed to evaluate the related preventive behaviors to COVID-19, and associated factors among Iranians based on the constructs of the Health Belief Model (HBM). Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted between March and April 2020 among Iranians. Data of 1,020 people were collected by a self-administered questionnaire based on the constructs of HBM and also a demographics questionnaire. Simple and multivariable linear regression models were used to determine the predictors of preventive behaviors concerning COVID-19. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: The mean score of preventive behaviors concerning COVID-19 was 4.27 (standard deviation = 0.60). 40.6% (95% CI: 38.6-43.7%), and 56.5% (95% CI: 53.4-59.5%) of the participants exhibited a high, and moderate level of preventive behaviors, respectively. 75.1% of the participants would always/often wear face masks out home or in crowded places. The most common preventive behaviors were using of personal belongings in the workplace or at home (96.1%) and staying at home except for very necessary or for work (92.9%). Results showed that all six HBM constructs, i.e., perceived susceptibility (B = 0.07, P < 0.001), perceived severity (B = 0.08, P < 0.001), perceived benefits (B = 0.25, P < 0.001), perceived barriers (B = -0.12, P = 0.001), cues to action (B = 0.07, P < 0.001), and self-efficacy (B = 0.26, P < 0.001) were significant predictors of related preventive behaviors to COVID-19. Female gender was another predictor of preventive behaviors (B = 0.18, P < 0.001). Conclusions: This study demonstrated the effectiveness of HBM constructs in predicting COVID-19 preventive behaviors. Therefore, the model as a framework for designing training programs for improving health behaviors among Iranians during the COVID-19 pandemic seems to be helpful.","Delshad Noghabi, Ali; Mohammadzadeh, Fatemeh; Yoshany, Nooshin; Javanbakht, Sara",J Prev Med Hyg,,394

235798,Multi-criterion Intelligent Decision Support system for COVID-19,2021,"Compartmental models in epidemiology characterize the spread of an infectious disease by formulating ordinary differential equations to quantify the rate of disease progression through subpopulations defined by the Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) scheme. The classic rate law central to the SIR compartmental models assumes that the rate of transmission is first order regarding the infectious agent. The current study demonstrates that this assumption does not always hold and provides a theoretical rationale for a more general rate law, inspired by mixed-order chemical reaction kinetics, leading to a modified mathematical model for non-first-order kinetics. Using observed data from 127 countries during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, we demonstrated that the modified epidemic model is more realistic than the classic, first-order-kinetics based model. We discuss two coefficients associated with the modified epidemic model: transmission rate constant k and transmission reaction order n. While k finds utility in evaluating the effectiveness of control measures due to its responsiveness to external factors, n is more closely related to the intrinsic properties of the epidemic agent, including reproductive ability. The rate law for the modified compartmental SIR model is generally applicable to mixed-kinetics disease transmission with heterogeneous transmission mechanisms. By analyzing early-stage epidemic data, this modified epidemic model may be instrumental in providing timely insight into a new epidemic and developing control measures at the beginning of an outbreak.","Mun, Eun-Young; Geng, Feng",PLoS One,,394

For years, subcutaneous vaccination was recommended in patients with hemophilia to avoid intramuscular bleeds. Therefore, recommendations for the application of COVID-19 vaccines are needed. METHODS: The Delphi methodology was used to develop consensus recommendations. An initial list of recommendations was prepared by a steering committee and evaluated by 39 hemophilia experts. Consensus was defined as &#8805;75% agreement and strong consensus as &#8805;95% agreement, and agreement as a score &#8805;7 on a scale of 1 to 9. After four rounds, a final list of statements was compiled. RECOMMENDATIONS: Consensus was achieved that COVID-19 vaccines licensed only for intramuscular injection should be administered intramuscularly in hemophilia patients. Prophylactic factor replacement, given on the day of vaccination with a maximum interval between prophylaxis and vaccination of 24 hours (factor VIII and conventional factor IX concentrates) or 48 hours (half-life extended factor IX), should be provided in patients with moderate or severe hemophilia. Strong consensus was achieved that patients with mild hemophilia and residual factor activity greater than 10% with mild bleeding phenotype or patients on emicizumab usually do not need factor replacement before vaccination. Swelling, erythema, and hyperthermia after vaccination are not always signs of bleeding but should prompt consultation of a hemophilia care center. In case of injection-site hematoma, patients should receive replacement therapy until symptoms disappear. CONCLUSIONS: Consensus was achieved on recommendations for intramuscular COVID-19 vaccination after replacement therapy for hemophilia patients depending on disease severity.","Pfrepper, Christian; Holstein, Katharina; Königs, Christoph; Heller, Christine; Krause, Manuela; Olivieri, Martin; Bidlingmaier, Christoph; Sigl-Kraetzig, Michael; Wendisch, Jörg; Halimeh, Susan; Horneff, Silvia; Richter, Heinrich; Wieland, Ivonne; Klamroth, Robert; Oldenburg, Johannes; Tiede, Andreas",Hamostaseologie,,394

Potentially, the COVID-19 pandemic affects physical and mental health as well as behavioral and social aspects. However, the direct impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on health-related parameters are not yet known. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of 16 weeks during the COVID-19 pandemic on health-related parameters of physically inactive women aged 50 to 70 years. METHODS: Thirty-four physically inactive women participated in the study. We performed tests to evaluate aerobic capacity and muscle strength, anthropometric measurements, blood pressure (BP), blood parameters, diet, and physical activity levels. All evaluations were carried out before and 16 weeks after the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil (i.e., from March to July 2020). RESULTS: Systolic BP (p < .0001; effect size (ES) = 0.62), diastolic BP (p < .0001; ES = 0.71), grip strength of the right (p < .05; ES = 0.43) and left hand (p < .05; ES = 0.49), performance in six-minute walk test (p < .05; ES = 0.46), free time physical activity levels (p < .05; ES = 0.40), domestic physical activity levels (p < .05; ES = 0.39), platelet count (p < .0001; ES = 0.48), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (p < .0001; ES = 1.14) reduced in comparison to the period before the pandemic. In contrast, glycated hemoglobin levels (p < .0001; ES = 0.77), triglycerides (p < .05; ES = 0.40), and insulin levels (p < .05; ES = 0.60) increased in comparison to the period before the pandemic.

Due to the lack of specific drugs against coronavirus, the existing antiviral and antimalarial drugs are currently being administered to the patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The scientists are also considering repurposing of some of the existing drugs as a suitable option in search of effective drugs against coronavirus till the establishment of a potent drug and/or vaccine. Computer-aided drug discovery provides a promising attempt to enable scientists to develop new and target specific drugs to combat any disease. The discovery of novel targets for COVID-19 using computer-aided drug discovery tools requires knowledge of the structure of coronavirus and various target proteins present in the virus. Targeting viral proteins will make the drug specific against the virus, thereby, increasing the chances of viral mortality. Hence, this review provides the structure of SARS-CoV-2 virus along with the important viral components involved in causing infection. It also focuses on the role of various target proteins in disease, the mechanism by which currently administered drugs act against the virus and the repurposing of few drugs. The gap arising from the absence of specific drugs is addressed by proposing potential antiviral drug targets which might provide insights into structure-based drug development against SARS-CoV-2.","Yadav, Manisha; Dhagat, Swasti; Eswari, J Satya",Eur J Pharm Sci,,394
237854,Comparing machine learning algorithms for predicting ICU admission and mortality in COVID-19,2021,"AIMS: Pre-existing cardiovascular disease in general and related risk factors have been associated with poor coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outcomes. However, data on outcomes of COVID-19 among people with pre-existing diagnosis of heart failure (HF) have not been studied in sufficient detail. We aimed to perform detailed characterization of the association of pre-existing HF with COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective cohort study based on Veterans Health Administration (VHA) data comparing 30 day mortality and hospital admission rates after COVID-19 diagnosis among Veterans with and without pre-existing diagnosis of HF. Cox-regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) with adjustment for covariates. Among 31 051 veterans (97% male) with COVID-19, 6148 had pre-existing diagnosis of HF. The mean (SD) age of patients with HF was 70 (13) whereas the mean (SD) age of patients without HF was 57 (17). Within the HF group with available data on left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), 1844 patients (63.4%) had an EF of >45%, and 1063 patients (36.6%) had an EF of &#8804;45%. Patients in the HF cohort had higher 30 day mortality (5.4% vs. 1.5%) and admission (18.5% vs. 8.4%) rates after diagnosis of COVID-19. After adjustment for age, sex, and race, HRs (95% CIs) for 30 day mortality and for 30 day hospital admissions were 1.87 (1.61-2.17) and 1.79 (1.66-1.93), respectively. After additional adjustment for medical comorbidities, HRs for 30 day mortality and for 30 day hospital admissions were 1.37 (1.15-1.64) and 1.27 (1.16-1.38), respectively. The findings were similar among HF patients with preserved vs. reduced EF, among those taking vs. not taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers or angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors, and among those taking vs. not taking anticoagulants. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 and pre-existing diagnosis of HF had a higher risk of 30 day mortality and hospital admissions compared to those without history of HF. The findings were similar by EF categories and by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blocker/angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors or anticoagulant use.","Rumery, Kyle; Seo, Angie; Jiang, Lan; Choudhary, Gaurav; Shah, Nishant R; Rudolph, James L; Wu, Wen-Chih; Erqou, Sebhat",ESC Heart Fail,,394

238315,Evaluation of Country Dietary Habits Using Machine Learning Techniques in Relation to Deaths from COVID-19,2020,"Scripps Research Education Outreach and Community Engagement (EOCE)programs comprise initiatives for people of all ages including K-12 students and teachers, undergraduates, and the public. Our overarching goals are to promote careers in biomedical research, raise awareness about the importance of scientific research,train the next generation of scientists, and increase diversity in the biomedical research workforce. The Covid-19 pandemic immediately haltedour in-person eventsand presented a new set ofchallenges to reaching our goals. It became necessaryto create a strong online presence to keep connected with our audience and stakeholders. As a leading research institute, Scripps Research is keenly aware of the importance of technology, and we quickly leveraged the use of Zoom and our learning management system (LMS) to facilitate the implementation of online outreach programs. Here we describe three programs that were implemented online. 1) Junior Scientist Training Program (JSTP) is a series of one-week virtual science camps with hands-on science experiments and/or data analysis. What makes JSTP different from other science ?box? clubs is that students learn scientific concepts in bioinformatics, microbiology, and biochemistry, and design their own experiments based on the tools provided and their home environment. Results are not ?pre-determined? as with traditional laboratory class protocols. This is particularly important because one of the first epiphanies students have with real research is the notion that there is no ?correct? answer. 2) Fully Interactive Resources for Students and Teachers (FIRST) is a webinar series featuring scientists discussing their research and career path, advising on how to develop scientific creativity, and giving science demonstrations. This program has been fundamental in supporting thousands of undergraduate students who have been affected by the lack of research opportunities due to the pandemic! 3) SciMet Competition is a Spanish-English bilingual science competition where K-12 students nationwide are invited to demonstrate their scientific curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking skills via drawings (K-5), videos (6-8), and essays (9-12). Projects exceeded our expectations and the bilingual component allowed us to reach into Hispanics and LatinX communities. Gains of moving programs online included increased engagement;increased reach across the USA and the world;higher efficacy in collecting pre- and post-data using integrated surveys and digital applications;successful implementation of inclusive and equitable virtual educational environments;and a significant rise in the number of volunteers due to convenient and accessible online tools for the scientist community. Despite the apprehension of virtual science programs, the benefits prove that some of these elements should be kept in future programming whether in person or not, as we believe that this demonstrates our commitment to our community partners and scientific accessibility for all.","Bhaskaran, Nitya Albarran-Zeckler Rosie",The FASEB Journal,,394

In view of the application of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in the plague over these years, the therapeutic advantages of TCM in different stages of COVID-19 were expounded as “strengthening body resistance and eliminating evil, meeting changes with constancy”, “Syndrome differentiation and treatment, meeting change with variance”, with aim to reduce the sequelae caused by hormone and other drugs and the mortality. It is suggested that Chinese medicine of clearing heat and removing toxin should be used to prevent the uninfected people from COVID-19, and intervene in the early stage of the disease and control the development of it to be severe by inhibiting the “cytokine storm”. In order to refine the dialectical classification according to the theory of “defensing-qi-nutrient-blood syndrome differentiation”, to give full play to the individual advantages of TCM in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. We should pay attention to the rational use of TCM in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, collect the real world clinical data, and integrate TCM and Western medicine with TCM as the main part.

242036,Introduction to the Special Issue on Immigration Detention,2020,"Importance: Black patients are overrepresented in the number of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in the US. Reasons for this disparity may be due to underlying comorbidities or sociodemographic factors that require further exploration. Objective: To systematically determine patient characteristics associated with racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study used comparative groups of patients tested or treated for COVID-19 at the University of Michigan from March 10, 2020, to April 22, 2020, with an outcome update through July 28, 2020. A group of randomly selected untested individuals were included for comparison. Examined factors included race/ethnicity, age, smoking, alcohol consumption, comorbidities, body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), and residential-level socioeconomic characteristics. Exposure: In-house polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, commercial antibody tests, nasopharynx or oropharynx PCR deployed by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and reverse transcription-PCR tests performed in external labs. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were being tested for COVID-19, having test results positive for COVID-19 or being diagnosed with COVID-19, being hospitalized for COVID-19, requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission for COVID-19, and COVID-19-related mortality (including inpatient and outpatient). Medical comorbidities were defined from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, codes and were aggregated into a comorbidity score. Associations with COVID-19 outcomes were examined using odds ratios (ORs). Results: Of 5698 patients tested for COVID-19 (mean [SD] age, 47.4 [20.9] years; 2167 [38.0%] men; mean [SD] BMI, 30.0 [8.0]), most were non-Hispanic White (3740 patients [65.6%]) or non-Hispanic Black (1058 patients [18.6%]). The comparison group included 7168 individuals who were not tested (mean [SD] age, 43.1 [24.1] years; 3257 [45.4%] men; mean [SD] BMI, 28.5 [7.1]). Among 1139 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 492 (43.2%) were White and 442 (38.8%) were Black; 523 (45.9%) were hospitalized, 283 (24.7%) were admitted to the ICU, and 88 (7.7%) died. Adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, and comorbidity score, Black patients were more likely to be hospitalized compared with White patients (OR, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.15-2.58]; P = .009). In addition to older age, male sex, and obesity, living in densely populated areas was associated with increased risk of hospitalization (OR, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.01-1.19]; P = .02). In the overall population, higher risk of hospitalization was also observed in patients with preexisting type 2 diabetes (OR, 1.82 [95% CI, 1.25-2.64]; P = .02) and kidney disease (OR, 2.87 [95% CI, 1.87-4.42]; P < .001). Compared with White patients, obesity was associated with higher risk of having test results positive for COVID-19 among Black patients (White: OR, 1.37 [95% CI, 1.01-1.84]; P = .04. Black: OR, 3.11 [95% CI, 1.64-5.90]; P < .001; P for interaction = .02). Having any cancer was associated with higher risk of positive COVID-19 test results for Black patients (OR, 1.82 [95% CI, 1.19-2.78]; P = .005) but not White patients (OR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.84-1.40]; P = .53; P for interaction = .04). Overall comorbidity burden was associated with higher risk of hospitalization in White patients (OR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.11-1.53]; P = .001) but not in Black patients (OR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.83-1.17]; P = .88; P for interaction = .02), as was type 2 diabetes (White: OR, 2.59 [95% CI, 1.49-4.48]; P < .001; Black: OR, 1.17 [95% CI, 0.66-2.06]; P = .59; P for interaction = .046). No statistically significant racial differences were found in ICU admission and mortality based on adjusted analysis. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that preexisting type 2 diabetes or kidney diseases and living in high-population density areas were associated with higher risk for COVID-19 hospitalization. Associations of risk factors with COVID-19 outcomes differed by race.","Gu, Tian; Mack, Jasmine A; Salvatore, Maxwell; Prabhu Sankar, Swaraaj; Valley, Thomas S; Singh, Karandeep; Nallamothu, Brahmajee K; Kheterpal, Sachin; Lisabeth, Lynda; Fritsche, Lars G; Mukherjee, Bhramar",JAMA Netw Open,,394

The psychological status among healthcare workers and residents were barely know due to the lack of research after Wuhan eased of the lockdown. The purpose of this study was to assess people's mental health and the changes after Wuhan eased the lockdown. A cross-sectional online study among citizens in Wuhan was conducted. Among 1417 participants, 387(27.0%) were frontline healthcare workers and 1035(73.0%) were residents from the general public. Their COVID-19 psychological status was evaluated using Patient Health Questionnaire-9(PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), and the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C). Results show that 16.1%,22.3% and 17.2% healthcare workers and 21.2%, 16.7% and 17.2% general public had symptoms of depression, anxiety and PTSD ranging from moderate to severe. Anxiety levels were not significantly different between healthcare workers and the general public. The decreased income and the frequent social media exposure are the risk factors for general public. Compared to the early COVID-19 epidemic period, the proportion of anxiety and depression among both the general public and health workers decreased after Wuhan eased the lockdown. Our finding can be used to help the government of Wuhan to develop psychological interventions to improve the mental health of the population and work as a reference of public health guidelines for other cities with severe COVID-19 outbreak.","Lu, Peixin; Li, Xin; Lu, Long; Zhang, Yue",PLoS One,,394

Patients completed a survey-based questionnaire with the aim of assessing their epidemiological and clinical characteristics, general otorhinolaryngological symptoms, and smell and taste disorders. A total of 294 patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 completed the survey (147 females). The most prevalent general symptoms included fever, myalgia, cough, and headache. A total of 70.4% and 59.2% of patients reported smell and taste disorders, respectively. A significant association between the two above-mentioned disorders was found (rs: 0.412; P < .001). Smell disorders occurred before the other symptoms in 11.6% of patients and was not significantly associated with nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea. Interestingly, our statistical analysis did not show any significant difference, either for general symptoms or otorhinolaryngological features, between the clinical diagnosis group and the laboratory-confirmed diagnosis (polymerase chain reaction) group.

245624,Sister Robots - food and medicine carriers,2020,"BACKGROUND: While COVID-19 outbreak has had adverse psychological effects in children with special needs, the mental state and burden on their caregivers during this pandemic has yet to be reported. AIMS: The objectives of this study were to describe the mental health status and the change in perceived strain among caregivers during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Two hundred sixty four caregivers completed an online survey that assessed demographics, use and perspective on tele-rehabilitation, homecare therapy, caregiver's strain and mental health. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: The prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms were found to be 62.5 %, 20.5 % and 36.4 % respectively. A significant difference in caregiver strain (pâ¯<â¯ 0.001, effect size = 0.93) was observed during the outbreak compared to levels pre-outbreak (pre-outbreak strain was measured retrospectively). Caregivers not using tele-rehabilitation along with a perception of it being a poor medium for rehabilitation were at greater risks for poor mental health whereas a negative perception on homecare therapy were strongly associated with higher psychological symptoms and strain. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This study identified a high prevalence of depression and significant change in strain displayed by caregivers during the COVID-19 outbreak. We identified several factors associated with poor mental health and perceived strain that can be used to help safeguard caregivers.","Dhiman, Sapna; Sahu, Pradeep Kumar; Reed, William R; Ganesh, G Shankar; Goyal, Ramesh K; Jain, Shilpa",Res Dev Disabil,,394

Therapeutic principle of these patients is centered on improving oxygenation and lung protection and multiple organ function support. Respiration support includes high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC), non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), tracheal cannula with mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and assistance methods including lung recruitment and prone position ventilation. Considering COVID-19 progresses rapidly and is very difficult in respiratory therapy, we should pay close attention to above mentioned methods. In particular, identifying risk factors of treatment failure of HFNC and NIPPV in early phase, applying lung recruitment prudently and active application of turning around and beat back and prone position ventilation to help postural drainage and early tracheal cannula with mechanical ventilation and ECMO would be beneficial to the patients.","Wei, Zhang; Chun, Pan; Qing, Song",Med.

Antibody analysis is an important procedure for the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. We investigated the IgG, IgM, and IgA responses against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Materials and methods: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n = 178) in the Al Madinah region, Saudi Arabia, participated in this study. Of the 178 patients, 72 (40%) were categorized as severe, including 50 (69%) males and 22 (31%) females. The remaining106 (60%) patients were categorized as non-severe, including 85 (80%) males and 21 (20%) females. Qualitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was used to confirm the diagnosis of each patient. The specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 S protein IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies in patients' sera were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and compared between case presentations. Results: The current study showed that all severe hospitalized patients presented significantly (p < 0.0001) increased anti-S IgG and IgM antibody accumulation compared with non-severe patients. Additionally, the results also showed that 50% of severe males were positive to anti-S IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies, whereas only 40% positivity for all three-antibody isotypes was observed in severe females. The study also showed that 86% of males and 81% of females categorized as severe were positive for both IgG and IgM antibodies but negative for the IgA antibody against the S protein. Conclusion: The humoral immune response against SARS-CoV-2 proteins commonly results in the production of antibodies against viral proteins. Specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 S protein IgG class antibodies were detected at significantly higher levels than IgM class antibodies, and both IgG and IgM antibodies were detected at significantly higher levels than the IgA antibody among all patients. The variations of the humoral immune responses among hospitalized patients reflect the association between disease presentations and immunity against the virus. Collectively, these findings afford new insights into the different antibody isotypes in responses to COVID-19 hospitalized patients with dissimilar disease severity.","Mahallawi, Waleed H",,,394

Data were gathered from a sample of 57 Moroccan companies operating with international management styles and working according to the standards of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Then, the structural equation model (SEM) method was employed to test the proposed hypothesis of the theoretical model. The conclusive results revealed that SIM practices have a significant influence on a company’s CPB, essentially via the adoption of an innovative strategy. Therefore, CPB is likely to be upgraded whenever companies seek for improving the implementation of successful SIM practices.","Zaoui, Soukaina Hamou-ou-Brahim Safae Ait Zhou Haiwei Omrane Amina Huang Dechun",FIIB Business Review,,394

For this cross-sectional study we compared the amount and reporting characteristics of COVID-19-related academic articles and preprints and the number of ongoing clinical trials and systematic reviews. To do this, we searched the PubMed database of citations and abstracts for published life science journals by using appropriate combinations of medical subject headings (MeSH terms), and the COVID-19 section of the MedRxiv and BioRxiv archives up to 20 May 2020 (21 weeks). In addition, we searched Clinicaltrial.gov, Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, EU Clinical Trials Register, and 15 other trial registers, as well as PROSPERO, the international prospective register of systematic reviews. The characteristics of each publication were extracted. Regression analyses and Z tests were used to detect publication trends and their relative proportions. A total of 3635 academic publications and 3805 preprints were retrieved. Only 8.6% (n = 329) of the preprints were already published in indexed journals. The number of academic and preprint publications increased significantly over time (p<0.001). Case reports (6% academic vs 0.9% preprints; p<0.001) and letters (17.4% academic vs 0.5% preprints; p<0.001) accounted for a greater share of academic compared to preprint publications. Differently, randomized controlled trials (0.22% vs 0.63%; p<0.001) and systematic reviews (0.08% vs 5%) made up a greater share of the preprints. The relative proportion of clinical studies registered at Clinicaltrials.gov, Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, and EU Clinical Trials Register was 57.9%, 49.5%, and 98.9%, respectively, most of which were still ""recruiting"". PROSPERO listed 962 systematic review protocols. Preprints were slightly more prevalent than academic articles but both were increasing in number. The void left by the lack of primary studies was filled by an outpour of immediate opinions (i.e., letters to the editor) published in PubMed-indexed journals.

Sixty-eight Brazilian athletes (both sex, 14.7 ± 1.68 years) answered and adapted the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (I-PAQ) through an online platform. Participants were asked to report their level of physical activity before and during the period of social distance. 67.7% of the interviewed athletes said they were able to adapt their sports training to the isolation environment under the guidance of a distance physical education professional. Only 4.38% of the sample was not training under such supervision and, therefore, inactive. Among the activities performed in the isolation environment, calisthenics was the primary practice (Effect Size: &#402;2 = 0.50, p <0.0001) and the sport practiced at home was the secondary practice (Effect Size: &#402;2 = 0.27, p = 0.004).

Through a pen pal program, we connected 69 healthcare professional students with 180 older adults in our community to help reduce social isolation and loneliness. Participants were connected through letters, e-mails, and phone calls for three months. At the end of the program, we surveyed students (response rate: 62%). Half of the students reported spending less than 20 minutes per week on the project. Of the survey respondents roughly 91% were white, 74.4% were enrolled in the College of Medicine, and 51.1% were in their first year of their respective program. Students increased their knowledge of social isolation and loneliness (p = .0001), their interest in volunteering (p = .018) and working with older adults (p = .028), and their comfort communicating with older adults (p = .002). Students reported that their wellness improved and that they practiced skills that would be used in their future careers. By providing volunteer experiences to students, we can increase their exposure to the geriatric population, hopefully increasing the number of students who enter geriatrics while simultaneously reducing social isolation and loneliness in older adults.","Miller, Abigale J; Jezewski, Emily E; Harlow, Elizabeth N; Potter, Jane F",Gerontol Geriatr Educ,,394

OBJECTIVES: We sought to review current knowledge of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, particularly those deemed VOC/Is: B.1.351, B.1.1.7, and P.1. SOURCES: MEDLINE and BioRxiv databases, as well as the grey literature were searched for reports of SARS-CoV-2 variants since November 2020. Relevant articles and their references were screened. CONTENT: Mutations on the spike protein in particular may affect both affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 cell receptor ACEII or antibody binding. These VOC/Is often share similar mutation sets. The N501Y mutation is shared by the main three VOCs: B.1.1.7, first identified in the United Kingdom; P.1, originating from Brazil; and B.1.351, first described in South Africa. This mutation likely increases transmissibility, by increasing affinity for ACEII. The B.1.351 and P.1 variants also display the E484K mutation, which decreases binding of neutralizing antibodies, leading to partial immune escape, favoring reinfections, and decreased in vitro efficacy of some antibody therapies or vaccines. Those mutations may also have phenotypical repercussions of higher severity. Furthermore, the accumulation of mutations poses a diagnostic risk (lowered when using multiplex assays), as seen for some assays targeting the S-gene. With ongoing surveillance, many new VOC/Is have been identified. The emergence of the E484K mutation independently in different parts of the globe may reflect adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to humans in a background of increasing immunity. IMPLICATIONS: These VOC/Is are increasing in frequency globally and pose challenges to any herd immunity approach of managing the pandemic. While vaccination is ongoing, vaccine updates may be prudent. The virus continues to adapt to transmission in humans, and further divergence from the initial Wuhan sequences is expected.","Boehm, Erik; Kronig, Ilona; Neher, Richard A; Eckerle, Isabella; Vetter, Pauline; Kaiser, Laurent",Clin. microbiol. infect,,394

In March 2020, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZI) were proposed as potential treatments of COVID-19, but with warnings concerning their possible toxicity. No data are available regarding the toxicity of this treatment in haemodialysis patients. METHODS: We report the use of HCQ and AZI in a cohort of COVID-19 haemodialysis patients with focus on safety concerns. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients received 200 mg HCQ thrice daily during 10 days, and AZI 500 mg on Day 1, and 250 mg on the four following days. HCQ plasma concentrations were within the recommended range (0.1-1.0 µg/mL) in all patients except one, in which maximum concentration was 1.1 µg/mL. HCQ concentration raised until the third day and remained stable thereafter. No cardiac event occurred in spite of progressive lengthening of corrected QT interval (QTc) during the treatment. One patient experienced a long QTc syndrome (QTc >500 ms) without any arrhythmia episode, although HCQ concentration was in the target range. Five (23.8%) patients experienced hypoglycaemia, a well-known HCQ side-effect. SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained detectable in nasopharyngeal swabs for a long time in haemodialysis patients (mean time 21 days). CONCLUSIONS: HCQ and AZI are safe in haemodialysis patients at these doses but can lead to long QTc syndrome and hypoglycaemia. HCQ concentrations were not correlated with side effects. We recommend monitoring of the QTc length throughout treatment, as well as glycaemia. SARS-CoV-2 could persist for longer in haemodialysis patients than in the general population.","Giaime, Philippe; Guenoun, Maxime; Pedinielli, Nathalie; Narbonne, Hervé; Bergounioux, Jean-Philippe; Solas, Caroline; Guilhaumou, Romain; Sampol, Jérôme; Ollier, Jacques; Sichez, Hélène; Serveaux, Marianne; Brunner, Flora; Bataille, Stanislas",Nephrol Dial Transplant,,394

Despite its paramount significance for the human immune system, many aspects of how the BM enables decade-long immunity against pathogens are still poorly understood. In this review, we discuss the relationship between BM survival niches and long-lasting humoral immunity, how intrinsic and extrinsic factors define memory cell longevity and show that the BM is also capable of adopting many responsibilities of a secondary lymphoid organ. Additionally, with more and more data on the differentiation and maintenance of memory T-cells and plasma cells upon vaccination in humans being reported, we discuss what factors determine the establishment of long-lasting immunological memory in the BM and what we can learn for vaccination technologies and antigen design. Finally, using these insights, we touch on how this holistic understanding of the BM is necessary for the development of modern and efficient vaccines against the pandemic SARS-CoV-2.","Slamanig, Stefan A; Nolte, Martijn A",,,394

Lebanese citizens? trust, as well as the international community's trust in the government, have unfortunately been destroyed. Consequently, Lebanon's sole option is to rebuild confidence in the government and public institutions by implementing economic reforms and to seek an IMF program to pave the way for additional financing from other international sources. The most important confidence-building step is a clear financial and economic plan that has the support of all key stakeholders. This article presents a road map for a reforms-driven, export-led growth strategy for Lebanon. Ultimately, the goal is to jump-start the economy and put it on a path of sustainable, inclusive, and equitable economic growth. Such growth should be grounded in a small, open-economy model and driven by low tariffs, a flexible exchange rate regime, and a dynamic export sector built on competitive and comparative advantages. This plan partially builds on proposals and recommendations provided by previous economic plans and policy notes.","Dagher, Leila Nehme Raoul",Middle East Policy,,394

Based on our proposed model, we further use the optimal control approach (with the objective of minimizing total deaths) to find the optimal dynamical distribution of face masks between the healthcare workers and the general public. It is not surprising that all the face masks should be solely reserved for the healthcare workers if the supply is short. However, when the supply is indeed sufficient, our numerical study indicates that the general public should share a large portion of face masks at the beginning of an epidemic wave to dramatically reduce the death toll. This interesting result partially contradicts with the guideline advised by the US Surgeon General and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in March 2020. The optimality of this sounding CDC guideline highly depends on the supply level of face masks that changes frequently, and hence it should be adjusted according to the supply of face masks.","Liu, Jun; Wang, Xiang-Sheng",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.03023v1.pdf,394

260876,Experimental investigation of a novel multi-channel flat plate liquid desiccant dehumidification system,2020,"BACKGROUND: Older age (60+ years) increases the risk of contracting and dying from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which might suggest worse mental health for those in this age range during the pandemic. Indeed, greater worry about COVID-19 is associated with poorer mental health. However, older age is generally associated with better emotional well-being, despite increased likelihood of negative events (e.g. death of a spouse) with age. This study examined whether age moderated the relation between COVID-19 worries and mental health. METHODS: A national sample of U.S. adults (N = 848; aged 18-85 years) completed an online survey from March 30 to April 5, 2020. The survey assessed anxiety, depression, general concern about COVID-19, perceived likelihood of contracting COVID-19, social distancing, self-quarantining, current mood, health, and demographics. RESULTS: Older age was associated with better mental health (i.e. lower levels of anxiety and depression). Greater perceived likelihood of contracting COVID-19 was related to higher anxiety. However, this effect was moderated by age. At younger ages (18-49 years), the positive association between perceived likelihood of contracting COVID-19 and anxiety was significant, but the association was not significant at older ages (50+ years). CONCLUSION: Older age may buffer against the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. More research is necessary to understand the potential protective nature of age during the pandemic, as well as the recovery period.","Wilson, Jenna M; Lee, Jerin; Shook, Natalie J",Aging Ment Health,,394

The group has proposed in this article the power of using two such diagnostic measures that has been the pivot for many diagnoses to the doctors. The art of using natural language processing based symptomatic measure in combination with a machine learning based approach based on medical vitals can collectively reduce the error percentage of detection. The approach proposed in this article is a first of its kind and the authors have achieved acceptable results on the accuracy front. The other reason of proposing such a technique is the way a fusion algorithm can arrive at the right results from two parallel algorithms doing the same task.

METHODS: The proposed treatment schemes, favoring hypofractionated schedules, and COVID-19 management strategies regarding irradiation are presented. Attendance after two months of implementation of these policies was measured and compared with that during the same period in 2019. RESULTS: A 10% reduction in the number of treated patients and a 26% reduction in the number of sessions was observed. The main impact was a decrease in the treatment of benign diseases and gastrointestinal tumors, with a general increase in breast cancer treatments. Eighteen (1.7%) patients were confirmed as having COVID-19 during radiotherapy in April and May 2020, three of whom were hospitalized, and one patient died because of COVID-19. Among the 18 patients, 12 had their treatments interrupted for at least 15 days from symptom appearance. CONCLUSION: There was a decrease in the number of treated patients in our radiotherapy department, with a greater decrease in the total number of sessions. This indicated, overall, a smaller number of fractions/patients treated, despite our efforts to maintain the treatment routine.

The live pathogen vaccine (LPV) strategy, which originated in ancient China for fighting smallpox, has been applied successfully by US military recruits for decades to control acute respiratory diseases caused by types 4 and 7 adenoviruses. This strategy has also been widely employed in veterinary medicine. These facts suggest a fast way out of the current pandemic crisis, namely that SARS-CoV-2 could be directly used as a live vaccine. Beyond the two traditional mechanisms to guarantee the LPV's safety (the LPV seed strain is properly selected; the LPV is inoculated bypassing the respiratory sites of pathology), three novel mechanisms to further ensure the LPV's safety are available (the virus replication is inhibited with early use of an antiviral drug; symptomatic LPV recipients are cured with convalescent plasma; the LPV is inoculated in the hot season). This LPV strategy has multiple potential advantages over other options and could reduce morbidity and mortality greatly as well as the economic loss caused by the pandemic. The safety and efficacy of this strategy should be investigated strictly using animal experiments and clinical trials, and even if the experiments and trials all support the strategy, it should be implemented with enough caution.","Chen, Ji-Wang; Chen, Ji-Ming",J. med. virol,,394

The wife (patient 1) was partially immunocompromised as a consequence of a recently started chemotherapy with fulvestrant and abemaciclid for recurring breast cancer, her husband (patient 2) had been healthy except for a history of controlled arterial hypertension. Both patients were treated with darunavir/cobicistat and hydroxychloroquine. The clinical course of the immunocompromised partner was benign, without need of intensive care. She was able to leave the hospital on day 6 after admission. In contrast, her husband needed intensive care and his recovery was slow, although eventually successful too. These findings suggest that the course of COVID-19 is not necessarily ominous in the presence of a compromised immune response and tend to reinforce the emerging therapeutic concepts of a controlled mitigation of the immune cascade following SARS CoV-2 infection.","Spezzani, Valentina; Piunno, Alessio; Iselin, Hans-Ulrich",Swiss Med Wkly,,394

Currently there is no specific vaccine or drug against COVID-19. Xu et al. (2020) built a homolog model of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro based on SARS-CoV Mpro which is considered as target to inhibit the replication of CoV. OBJECTIVE: The aim of current study is to find potential inhibitors of COVID-19 Mpro using docking analysis. METHODS: Autodockvina was used to carry out Protein-Ligand docking. COVID-19 main protease Mpro was docked with catechin and its different synthetic derivatives. Nelfinavir is an antiretroviral drug belongs to protease inhibitors was taken as standard. RESULTS: According to the result obtained it was found that Compound (4) and Compound (1) have more affinity than nelfinavir. CONCLUSION: Compounds have a great potential to become COVID-19 main protease Mpro inhibitor. Nevertheless for their medicinal use further investigation is necessary.,"Arif, Muhammad Nouman",Combinatorial chemistry &amp; high throughput screening (Online),,394
268989,Adherence to food hygiene and personal protection recommendations for prevention of COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Life expectancy (LE) improvements have stalled, and UK tax and welfare 'reforms' have been proposed as a cause. We estimated the effects of tax and welfare reforms from 2010/2011 to 2021/2022 on LE and inequalities in LE in Scotland. METHODS: We applied a published estimate of the cumulative income impact of the reforms to the households within Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) quintiles. We estimated the impact on LE by applying a rate ratio for the impact of income on mortality rates (by age group, sex and SIMD quintile) and calculating the difference between inflation-only changes in benefits and the reforms. RESULTS: We estimated that changes to household income resulting from the reforms would result in an additional 1041 (+3.7%) female deaths and 1013 (+3.8%) male deaths. These deaths represent an estimated reduction of female LE from 81.6 years to 81.2 years (-20 weeks), and male LE from 77.6 years to 77.2 years (-23 weeks). Cuts to benefits and tax credits were modelled to have the most detrimental impact on LE, and these were estimated to be most severe in the most deprived areas. The modelled impact on inequalities in LE was widening of the gap between the most and least deprived 20% of areas by a further 21 weeks for females and 23 weeks for males. INTERPRETATION: This study provides further evidence that austerity, in the form of cuts to social security benefits, is likely to be an important cause of stalled LE across the UK.","Richardson, Elizabeth; Taulbut, Martin; Robinson, Mark; Pulford, Andrew; McCartney, Gerry",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),,394

In the case of $n$ items and $k$ defectives, we provide an algorithm attaining high-probability recovery with $O(k \log n)$ scaling in both the number of tests and runtime, improving on the best known $O(k^2 \log k \cdot \log n)$ runtime previously available for any algorithm that only uses $O(k \log n)$ tests. Our algorithm bears resemblance to Hwang's adaptive generalized binary splitting algorithm (Hwang, 1972); we recursively work with groups of items of geometrically vanishing sizes, while maintaining a list of""possibly defective""groups and circumventing the need for adaptivity. While the most basic form of our algorithm requires $\Omega(n)$ storage, we also provide a low-storage variant based on hashing, with similar recovery guarantees.","Price, Eric; Scarlett, Jonathan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10268v1.pdf,394

Here, we fitted the contrast response function to psychometric orientation discrimination data while also varying attention demand during maintenance to investigate: (1) whether VSTM load effects on perception are mediated by a modulation of the contrast threshold, consistent with contrast gain accounts, or by the function asymptote (1 lapse rate), consistent with response gain accounts; and (2) whether the VSTM load effects on the contrast response function depend on the availability of attentional resources. We manipulated VSTM load via the number of items in the memory set in a color and location VSTM task and assessed the contrast response function for an orientation discrimination task during maintenance. Attention demand was varied through spatial cuing of the orientation stimulus. Higher VSTM load increased the estimated contrast threshold of the contrast response function without affecting the estimated asymptote, but only when the discrimination task demanded attention. When attentional demand was reduced (in the cued conditions), the VSTM load effects on the contrast threshold were eliminated. The results suggest that VSTM load reduces perceptual sensitivity by increasing contrast thresholds, suggestive of a contrast gain modulation mechanism, as long as the perceptual discrimination task demands attention. These findings support recent claims that attentional resources are shared between perception and VSTM maintenance processes.","Konstantinou, Nikos; Lavie, Nilli",J Vis,,394

METHODS: We conducted telephone interviews with 40 patients to examine how the pandemic affected prenatal genetic screening and diagnostic testing decisions during the initial months of the pandemic in the United States. An interview guide queried experiences with the ability to access information about prenatal genetic testing options and to utilize the tests when desired. Audio recordings were transcribed and coded using NVivo 12. Analysis was conducted using Grounded Theory. RESULTS: The pandemic did not alter most participants' decisions to undergo prenatal genetic testing. Yet, it did impact how participants viewed the risks and benefits of testing and timing of testing. There was heightened anxiety among those who underwent testing, stemming from the risk of viral exposure and the fear of being alone if pregnancy loss or fetal abnormality was identified at the time of an ultrasound-based procedure. CONCLUSION: The pandemic may impact patients' access and utilization of prenatal genetic tests. More research is needed to determine how best to meet pregnant patients' decision-making needs during this time.","Farrell, Ruth M; Pierce, Madelyn; Collart, Christina; Craighead, Caitlin; Coleridge, Marissa; Chien, Edward K; Perni, Uma; Frankel, Richard; Ranzini, Angela; Edmonds, Brownsyne Tucker; Rose, Susannah S",Prenat. diagn,,394

Methods: Six patients who, at the moment of the lockdown, were treated through different psychotherapy approaches and antipsychotic drugs for a first brief psychotic episode accessed a 4-week online compassion-focused intervention comprising a weekly individual video-call session, and an open messenger service with audio-recorded compassion focused practices. Primary outcome (general symptomatology) was assessed one‐week before and at the end of the intervention. Secondary outcomes (depression, anxiety and stress symptoms) were assessed daily during the intervention, for a total of 28 days. Results: Five of six participants demonstrated a reliable change in both primary and secondary outcomes, and no one reported acute psychotic episodes during the lockdown. All participants reported a stable or increased working alliance. Conclusion: These data provide the preliminary feasibility and effectiveness of a brief online compassion-focused crisis intervention for patients diagnosed with a brief psychotic disorder, in situations where the telepsychology is offered, unplanned, as the only possible treatment option.","Cheli, Simone; Cavalletti, Veronica; Petrocchi, Nicola",Psychosis,,394

274548,Operational risk management using multi-criteria assessment (Ahp model),2021,"Alterations in brain functioning, especially in regions associated with cognition, can result from infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and are predicted to result in various psychiatric diseases. Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can directly or indirectly affect the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, diseases associated with sequelae of COVID-19, or 'long COVID', also include serious long-term mental and cognitive changes, including the condition recently termed 'brain fog'. Hypoxia in the microenvironment of select brain areas may benefit the reproductive capacity of the virus. It is possible that in areas of cerebral hypoxia, neuronal cell energy metabolism may become compromised after integration of the viral genome, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction. Because of their need for constant high metabolism, cerebral tissues require an immediate and constant supply of oxygen. In hypoxic conditions, neurons with the highest oxygen demand become dysfunctional. The resulting cognitive impairment benefits viral spread, as infected individuals exhibit behaviors that reduce protection against infection. The effects of compromised mitochondrial function may also be an evolutionary advantage for SARS-CoV-2 in terms of host interaction. A high viral load in patients with COVID-19 that involves the CNS results in the compromise of neurons with high-level energy metabolism. Therefore, we propose that selective neuronal mitochondrial targeting in SARS-CoV-2 infection affects cognitive processes to induce 'brain fog' and results in behavioral changes that favor viral propagation. Cognitive changes associated with COVID-19 will have increasing significance for patient diagnosis, prognosis, and long-term care.","Stefano, George B; Ptacek, Radek; Ptackova, Hana; Martin, Anders; Kream, Richard M",Med Sci Monit,,394
274790,Telehealth Management of Urostomy Postoperative Complications: A Case Study,2020,"PURPOSE: The SARS-CoV­2 pandemic has affected the health and practice of otorhinolaryngologists (ORLs) for over 1 year. Follow-up data of a national survey with German ORLs were evaluated regarding differences between the two waves of the pandemic. METHODS: As in the initial survey, German ORLs were addressed via e­mail through the German Society of ORL, Head and Neck Surgery and the German ENT Association. All ORLs afflicted with SARS-CoV­2 were invited to participate in a web-based survey. General data on infections and concomitant parameters were evaluated. RESULTS: Since the start of the pandemic, 129 ORLs reported testing positive for SARS-CoV­2 in Germany. The ORLs infected during the first wave had a relative risk (RR) of 4.07 (95% CI: 3.20; 5.19) of contracting SARS-CoV­2. During the second wave, the RR decreased to 0.35 (95% CI: 0.28; 0.45). The availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) increased from the first to the second wave along with an increased perception of protection in the professional environment. The source of infection shifted from infections via medical staff during the first wave to patients and household exposure during the second wave. Regular medical practice was resumed by clinicians and general practitioners in the second wave. Nevertheless, a proportionally lower infection rate was observed compared with the German population as a whole. CONCLUSION: The data reflect a unique long-term survey of ORLs during the pandemic. Differences in the source of infection were seen between the first and second wave, confirming the need for appropriate PPE for medical professionals working in high-risk environments. Further strategies to reduce the risk of infection include consistent testing for SARS-CoV­2 in healthcare professionals, patients, and the general public as well as vaccination of high-risk medical groups.","Herzog, Michael; Beule, Achim G; Lüers, Jan-Christoffer; Guntinas-Lichius, Orlando; Sowerby, Leigh J; Bogdanov, Vasyl; Grafmans, Daniel",HNO,,394

Patients presented 5 to 11 days after first vaccination. The spectrum of clinical manifestations included cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT), arterial cerebral thromboembolism, and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). All patients had thrombocytopenia and markedly elevated D-Dimer. Autoantibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4) were detected in all patients although they had never been exposed to heparin. Immunoglobulin from patient sera bound to healthy donor platelets in an AZD1222-dependant manner, suppressed by heparin. Aggregation of healthy donor platelets by patient sera was demonstrated in the presence of buffer or AZD1222 and was also suppressed by heparin. Anticoagulation alone or in combination with eculizumab or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) resolved the pathology in three patients. Two patients had thromboembolic events despite anticoagulation at a time when platelets were increasing after IVIG. In summary, an unexpected autoimmune prothrombotic disorder is described after vaccination with AZD1222. It is characterized by thrombocytopenia and anti-PF4 antibodies binding to platelets in AZD1222-dependent manner. Initial clinical experience suggests a risk of unusual and severe thromboembolic events.","Tiede, Andreas; Sachs, Ulrich J; Czwalinna, Andreas; Werwitzke, Sonja; Bikker, Rolf; Krauss, Joachim K; Donnerstag, Frank Gf; Weißenborn, Karin; Höglinger, Günter U; Maasoumy, Benjamin; Wedemeyer, Heiner; Ganser, Arnold",Blood,,394

277539,Introduction to Special Issue,2020,"Because health care workers are a reliable source of health information, their acceptance or rejection of COVID-19 vaccines can influence the general population's uptake of COVID-19 vaccines. In this study, we sought to determine the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccines among health care workers in Ghana. Using a cross-sectional design, we collected data from 234 health care workers through a self-administered online survey from 16 January to 15 February 2021. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were performed using STATA version 15. The findings revealed that 39.3% (n = 92) of health care workers intended to receive the COVID-19 vaccines. Factors such as sex (AOR = 0.451;CI 95% 0.240-0.845;p=0.013), category of health care workers (AOR = 2.851;95 CI%: 1.097-7.405;p=0.031), relative being diagnosed with COVID-19 (AOR = 0.369;CI 95% 0.145-0.941;p=0.037), and trust in the accuracy of the measures taken by the government in the fight against COVID-19 (AOR = 2.768;CI 95%: 1.365-5.616;p=0.005) proved to be significant predictors of the acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine. Concerns about the safety of vaccines (n = 93, 65.5%) and the adverse side effects of the vaccines (n = 23, 14.8%) were identified as the main reasons why health care workers would decline uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in Ghana. The self-reported low intention of health care workers in Ghana to accept COVID-19 vaccines necessitates an urgent call from the Government of Ghana and other stakeholders to address health care workers' concerns about the safety and adverse side effects of COVID-19 vaccines, as this would increase vaccine uptake. Interventions must also take into consideration sex and the category of health care workers to achieve the desired results. © 2021 Martin Wiredu Agyekum et al.","Agyekum, M. W.; Afrifa-Anane, G.

Here, we use Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to characterise the unpaired spins associated with the charges generated by molecular doping of the prototypical organic semiconductor poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) with 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) and tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (BCF). The EPR results reveal the P3HT radical cation as the only paramagnetic species in BCF-doped P3HT films and show evidence for increased mobility of the detected spins at high doping concentrations as well as formation of antiferromagnetically coupled spin pairs leading to decreased spin concentrations at low temperatures. The EPR signature for F4TCNQ-doped P3HT is found to be determined by spin exchange between P3HT radical cations and F4TCNQ radical anions. Results from continuous-wave and pulse EPR measurements suggest the presence of the unpaired spin on P3HT in a multitude of environments, ranging from free P3HT radical cations with similar properties to those observed in BCF-doped P3HT, to pairs of dipolar and exchange-coupled spins on P3HT and the dopant anion. Characterisation of the proton hyperfine interactions by ENDOR allowed quantification of the extent of spin delocalisation and revealed reduced delocalisation in the F4TCNQ-doped P3HT films.","Tait, Claudia E; Reckwitz, Anna; Arvind, Malavika; Neher, Dieter; Bittl, Robert; Behrends, Jan",PCCP.

The survey sample included 1000 respondents. Findings: The studied population (of Polish consumers) were less willing to pay with cash during the pandemic than beforehand. This is related with avoiding contact with cash, as well as easy documentation of transactions, increasing their transparency. During the pandemic Polish consumers were more willing to shop at Polish online shops or retail services (e.g. Allegro) than foreign ones (e.g., AliExpress). However, the study shows that Polish customers are more cautious in their shopping decisions during the pandemic, being afraid to lose financial liquidity. Practical Implications: The pandemic led to landslide changes in consumer behaviours and habits. Identification of the current shape of Polish customers' attitudes to cashless transactions and their perception of the associated risk of Covid-19 infection is important for all market entities related directly or indirectly to such transactions. Nowadays, it is difficult to even think of a business with no such needs. Originality/Value: The study presented in the paper is original because there was no research on cashless payments in relation to shopping risk. The article displays an original approach to the subject. The 2020 pandemic itself allows for observation of customers in a completely new situation and development of an entirely new area of consumer behaviour research.","Kulisz, Monika Bojanowska Agnieszka Toborek Katarzyna",European Research Studies,,394
280159,Assessment of the impact of US Energy Policy on world oil prices,2021,"PURPOSE: To perform a systematic analysis of articles on the ophthalmological implications of the global COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: PubMed.gov was searched for relevant articles using the keywords ""COVID-19"", ""coronavirus"", and ""SARS-CoV-2"" in conjunction with ""ophthalmology"" and ""eye"". Moreover, official recommendations of ophthalmological societies were systematically reviewed, with a focus on the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCOphth). RESULTS: As of April 16, 2020, in total, 21 peer-reviewed articles on the ophthalmological aspects of COVID-19 were identified. Of these, 12 (57.1%) were from Asia, 6 (28.6%) from the United States of America, and 3 (14.3%) from Europe. There were 5 (23.8%) original studies, 10 (47.6%) letters, 3 (14.2%) case reports, and 3 (14.2%) reviews. These articles could be classified into the topics ""Modes and prevention of (ocular) transmission"", ""Ophthalmological manifestations of COVID-19"", ""Clinical guidance concerning ophthalmological practice during the COVID-19 pandemic"", and ""Practical recommendations for clinical infrastructure"". Practical recommendations could be extracted from official statements of the AAO and the RCOphth. CONCLUSION: Within a short period, a growing body of articles has started to elucidate the ophthalmological implications of COVID-19. As the eye can represent a route of infection (actively via tears and passively via the nasoacrimal duct), ophthalmological care has to undergo substantial modifications during this pandemic. In the eye, COVID-19 can manifest as keratoconjunctivitis.","Siedlecki, Jakob; Brantl, Victor; Schworm, Benedikt; Mayer, Wolfgang Johann; Gerhardt, Maximilian; Michalakis, Stylianos; Kreutzer, Thomas; Priglinger, Siegfried",Klin Monbl Augenheilkd,,394

SUMMARY: An 80-year-old female presented to the emergency department after a fall with complaints of pain in her knee, shoulder, and hip. Her medical history was significant for coronary artery disease, for which she took clopidogrel 75 mg daily, and atrial fibrillation, for which she took dabigatran 150 mg twice daily. The physical exam was remarkable for pain within the shoulder, hip, and knee, which had swelling and ecchymosis that extended into the right thigh. Given the possibility of compartment syndrome with multiple possible etiologies of coagulopathy, TEG and computed tomography angiography (CTa) of the right lower extremity were performed. The initial TEG showed prolonged R time and activated clotting time, indicating clotting factor dysfunction with no additional coagulopathy noted, including antiplatelet effects. On the basis of the TEG and CTa findings, it was decided to reverse dabigatran with 5 grams of idarucizumab. Approximately 1 hour after administration of idarucizumab, the patient was taken to interventional radiology where a limited angiogram of the right lower extremity showed no active extravasation. Because of the patient's renal dysfunction and the possibility of rebound hypercoaguability, repeat TEG tests were ordered at 4 and 8 hours after the initial reversal to ensure clearance of idarucizumab-dabigatran complexes. The repeat TEG values showed complete reversal of the initial coagulopathy noted. During the admission, the patient required no blood transfusions or surgical interventions and all her initial laboratory results improved. CONCLUSION: Serial TEG testing was successful at managing multiple coagulopathies in a patient at risk for trauma-induced compartment syndrome.","Gilbert, Brian W; Ott, M Jacob; Philip, George J",Am J Health Syst Pharm,,394

283078,The cultural dimensions of the coronavirus crisis: soft power revisited,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The increased social and economic burden caused by the novel COVID-19 outbreak is gradually becoming a worrisome issue for the health sector. The novel coronavirus invades the target cell by binding to ACE2, which is widely expressed in the ovaries, uterus, vagina and placenta. Significantly, the SARS-CoV-2 is said to interrupt female fertility through regulating ACE2. Thus, it is essential to investigate if the novel COVID-19 hampers female fertility, given that there is no systematic and comprehensive evidence on the association of COVID-19 with female fertility. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will systematically search cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, case-control studies and self-controlled case series designs in the following databases: Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Ovid, EBSCO, WHO COVID-19 Database, Chinese Biomedical Databases, China National Knowledge Internet, VIP and WanFang Database. Medical Subject Headings and free-text terms for ""COVID-19"" AND ""female"" AND ""fertility"" will be performed. Eligibility criteria are as follows: population (female patients aged 13-49 years); exposure (infection with SARS-CoV-2); comparison (population without SARS-CoV-2 infections or latent SARS-CoV-2 infections); and outcome (female fertility, such as ovarian reserve function, uterine receptivity, oviducts status and menstruation status). Article screening and data extraction will be undertaken independently by two reviewers, and discrepancies will be resolved through discussion. We will use the I2 statistics to assess the heterogeneity and perform a meta-analysis when sufficiently homogeneous studies are provided. Otherwise, a narrative synthesis will be performed. We will explore the potential sources of heterogeneity using subgroup analyses and meta-regression.

Germany relies largely on migrant caregivers from Poland. Yet the pandemic-related mobility restrictions reveal the deficiencies of this transnational elder care system. This article asks if this system is resilient. In order to answer this question, the research team conducted interviews with 10 experts and randomly selected representatives of brokering and sending agencies in Germany and Poland. We interviewed 13 agencies in Germany and 15 in Poland on the agencies' characteristics, recruitment strategies, challenges of the pandemic, and impact of legal regulations in the sector. The analysis shows that the system could mobilize adaptive capacities and continue to deliver services, but its absorptive capacity is limited.

The present study aims to extend our understanding of how illness perceptions, coping, and self-efficacy affect adherence to precautionary measures among the public. An online survey was administered between April and June 2020 to a sample of 514 Hong Kong citizens. Variables considered were illness perceptions toward COVID-19, problem-solving, avoidance-based coping, self-efficacy, as well as adherence to precautionary measures including physical distancing, limiting unnecessary travelling, and washing hands regularly with soap and water. Adjusted structural equation model showed that illness perceptions toward COVID-19 had significant direct effect on their adherence to precautionary measures (unstandardized ß = 0.50, [95% CI, 0.28, 0.80], p = 0.001), and indirect effects through avoidance-based coping (ß = -0.10 [95% CI, -0.26, -0.01], p = 0.016) and self-efficacy (ß = -0.10, [95% CI, -0.18, -0.01], p = 0.025). These results imply that apart from emphasizing the health hazards of a novel infectious disease, an effective public health intervention and crisis communication should address avoidance-based coping and self-efficacy of the public in adherence to precautionary measures for COVID-19.","Chong, Yuen Yu; Chien, Wai Tong; Cheng, Ho Yu; Chow, Ka Ming; Kassianos, Angelos P; Karekla, Maria; Gloster, Andrew",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,394

284096,Outlier-SMOTE: A refined oversampling technique for improved detection of COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVE: We assessed the performance of the ratio of peripheral arterial oxygen saturation to the inspired fraction of oxygen (SpO2/FiO2) to predict the ratio of partial pressure arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) among patients admitted to our emergency department (ED) during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. METHODS: We retrospectively studied patients admitted to an academic-level ED in France who were undergoing a joint measurement of SpO2 and arterial blood gas. We compared SpO2 with SaO2 and evaluated performance of the SpO2/FiO2 ratio for the prediction of 300 and 400 mmHg PaO2/FiO2 cut-off values in COVID-19 positive and negative subgroups using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: During the study period from February to April 2020, a total of 430 arterial samples were analyzed and collected from 395 patients. The area under the ROC curves of the SpO2/FiO2 ratio was 0.918 (CI 95% 0.885-0.950) and 0.901 (CI 95% 0.872-0.930) for PaO2/FiO2 thresholds of 300 and 400 mmHg, respectively. The positive predictive value (PPV) of an SpO2/FiO2 threshold of 350 for PaO2/FiO2 inferior to 300 mmHg was 0.88 (CI95% 0.84-0.91), whereas the negative predictive value (NPV) of the SpO2/FiO2 threshold of 470 for PaO2/FiO2 inferior to 400 mmHg was 0.89 (CI95% 0.75-0.96). No significant differences were found between the subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: The SpO2/FiO2 ratio may be a reliable tool for hypoxemia screening among patients admitted to the ED, particularly during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.","Catoire, Pierre; Tellier, Eric; de la Rivière, Caroline; Beauvieux, Marie-Christine; Valdenaire, Guillaume; Galinski, Michel; Revel, Philippe; Combes, Xavier; Gil-Jardiné, Cédric",Am J Emerg Med,,394

284247,Consumer and food changes in Mexican households during maximal contingency in the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The epidemic potential of coronavirus infection is now a reality. Since the first case detected in late 2019 in China, a fast worldwide expansion confirms it. The vascular patient is at a higher risk of developing a severe form of the disease because of its nature associating several comorbid states, and thus, some vascular surgery communities from many countries have tried to stratify patients into those requiring care during these uncertain times. METHODS: This is an observational study describing the current daily vascular surgery practice at one tertiary academic hospital in Madrid region, Spain-one of the most affected regions worldwide due to the COVID-19 outbreak. We analyzed our surgical practice since March 14th when the lockdown was declared up to date, May 14th (2 months). Procedural surgical practice, organizational issues, early outcomes, and all the troubles encountered during this new situation are described. RESULTS: Our department is composed of 10 vascular surgeons and 4 trainees. Surgical practice has been reduced to only urgent care, totaling 50 repairs on 45 patients during the period. Five surgeries were performed on 3 COVID-19-positive patients. Sixty percent were due to critical limb ischemia, 45% of them performed by complete endovascular approach, whereas less than 10% of repairs were aorta related. We were allocated to use a total of 5 surgical rooms in different locations, none our usual, as it was converted into an ICU room while performing 50% of those repairs with unusual nursery staff. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 outbreak has dramatically changed our organization and practice in favor of urgent or semiurgent surgical care alone. The lack of in-hospital/ICU beds and changing nursery staff changed the whole availability organization at our hospital and was a key factor in surgical decision-making in some cases.","Reyes Valdivia, Andrés; Aracil Sanus, Enrique; Duque Santos, África; Gómez Olmos, Cristina; Gordillo Alguacil, Sergio; El Amrani, Mehdi; Ocaña Guaita, Julia; Gandarias Zúñiga, Claudio",Ann Vasc Surg,,394

We retrospectively reviewed 676 consecutive patients who received high-dose (>300 mL) iodixanol during PCI between October 2015 and December 2017 in 4 centers. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify significant independent predictors for CI-AKI. The incidence of CI-AKI was 3.5% (23/651). In patients administered 300 to 500 mL and >500 mL iodixanol, the incidence of CI-AKI was 3.9% and 1.7%, respectively. In patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, the incidence of CI-AKI was 2.6%. In high-risk and very high-risk patients, stratified by the Mehran risk score, the incidence of CI-AKI was 3.3% and 4.3%, respectively. In patients received high-dose iodixanol (>300 mL), logistic regression analysis demonstrated that female sex, chronic kidney disease, and eGFR were independent risk factors for CI-AKI, but contrast volume was not. The administration of high (300-500 mL) and very high (>500 mL) dose of iodixanol is associated with low rates of CI-AKI.","Zhao, Ning; Chen, Zaiyan; Zhou, Yinpin; Xu, Qiang; Xu, Zhonglin; Tong, Wuyang; Li, Lufeng; Mao, Qi; Song, Yaoming; Jin, Jun; Huang, Lan; Azzalini, Lorenzo; Zhao, Xiaohui",Angiology,,394

285405,The Effect of Coronavirus Spread on Stock Markets: The Case of the Worst 6 Countries,2020,"Home School Community Liaison Coordinators (HSCLs) play an essential role in the Irish education system to address systemic educational disadvantage by supporting children and families. This paper focuses on the experiences of HSCLs during Covid-19 school closures in Ireland in 2020. Research questions focus on challenges and enablers for HSCLs in supporting families during the shutdown and the impact of a whole school response on remote learning. Findings highlight the pivotal role of HSCLs in supporting the wellbeing of children and families. This involves the identification of basic and learning-related needs and engagement in coordinating with the school community and external agencies to respond to those needs. In this study, addressing basic critical needs was identified as the prerequisite to supporting home learning. The internal organisation and strategy of individual schools promoting a whole school approach to wellbeing and home-schooling was highlighted as key to successful support mechanisms. Recommendations highlight the importance of establishing and provisioning appropriate communication approaches with families in order for HSCLs to fulfil their role. Crucial here was the benefit of real physical contact as well as digital means. This has clear implications for public health guidance for schools in adopting holistic approaches to support families.

Following C. muridarum inoculation, wild type mice develop robust hydrosalpinx but OT1 mice fail to do so because their T cell receptors are engineered to recognize a single ovalbumin epitope (OVA457-462). These observations have demonstrated a critical role of Chlamydia-specific T cells in chlamydial pathogenicity. In the current study, we have also found that OT1 mice can actively inhibit chlamydial pathogenicity. First, depletion of CD8+ T cells from OT1 mice led to the induction of significant hydrosalpinx by Chlamydia, indicating that CD8+ T cells are necessary to inhibit chlamydial pathogenicity. Second, adoptive transfer of CD8+ T cells from OT1 mice to CD8 knockout mice significantly reduced chlamydial induction of hydrosalpinx, demonstrating that OT1 CD8+ T cells are sufficient for attenuating chlamydial pathogenicity in CD8 knockout mice. Finally, CD8+ T cells from OT1 mice also significantly inhibited hydrosalpinx development in wild type mice following an intravaginal inoculation with Chlamydia Since T cells in OT1 mice are engineered to recognize OVA457-462 epitope only, the above observations have demonstrated a chlamydial antigen-independent immune mechanism for regulating chlamydial pathogenicity. Further characterization of this mechanism may provide information for developing strategies to reduce infertility-causing pathology induced by infections.","Xie, Lingxiang; He, Conghui; Chen, Jianlin; Tang, Lingli; Zhou, Zhiguang; Zhong, Guangming",Infect. immun,,394

Because several pathogenic strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) have developed resistance against most of the established anti-TB drugs, new therapeutic options are urgently needed. An attractive target for the development of new antitubercular agents is the salicylate synthase MbtI, an essential enzyme for the mycobacterial siderophore biochemical machinery, absent in human cells. A set of analogues of I and II, two of the most potent MbtI inhibitors identified to date, was synthesized, characterized, and tested to elucidate the structural requirements for achieving an efficient MbtI inhibition and a potent antitubercular activity with this class of compounds. The structure-activity relationships (SAR) here discussed evidenced the importance of the furan as part of the pharmacophore and led to the preparation of six new compounds (IV-IX), which gave us the opportunity to examine a hitherto unexplored position of the phenyl ring. Among them emerged 5-(3-cyano-5-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)furan-2-carboxylic acid (IV), endowed with comparable inhibitory properties to the previous leads, but a better antitubercular activity, which is a key issue in MbtI inhibitor research. Therefore, compound IV offers promising prospects for future studies on the development of novel agents against mycobacterial infections.","Mori, Matteo; Stelitano, Giovanni; Chiarelli, Laurent R; Cazzaniga, Giulia; Gelain, Arianna; Barlocco, Daniela; Pini, Elena; Meneghetti, Fiorella; Villa, Stefania",,,394

Although the core principles of care for patients with cancer have not changed, this pandemic has led to heightened awareness concerning the fragility of patients with cancer and how healthcare systems can protect them. OBJECTIVES: The aims were to identify and implement inpatient and ambulatory care clinical practice changes during the COVID-19 pandemic, based on defining moments and coping strategies from clinical oncology nurses, advanced practice RNs, nurse leaders, and researchers. METHODS: This article presents a Lean Six Sigma framework, accompanied by numerous rapid cycle tests of change. FINDINGS: The COVID-19 pandemic required clinical healthcare providers at the authors' institution to focus on seven priority areas. Nurses tested and implemented practice changes.","Duncan, Regina; Szabo, Brittany; Jackson, Quincy L; Crain, Maria; Lett, Celia; Masters, Connie; Spinks, Renee; Uhrig, Lana K; Gullatte, Mary M",Clin J Oncol Nurs,,394

Prospective Shifts in International Haute Cuisine and Innovation beyond Kitchen and Plate,2020,"Teachers in initial training who attend the Practicum find, in this period, a meaning for the teaching profession, awakening a reflective and critical attitude about what and how they do things, and therefore, shaping their teaching identity. However, in recent months, the training situation of future teachers has taken a turn due to the health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The study carried out focused on inquiring, through a narrative research, how university students have perceived the period of practices they carried out through virtual teaching, as a consequence of the current health crisis. Among other results, the evidence showed that students developed insecurity feelings, melancholy and uncertainty in light of the new learning processes. On the other hand, by losing on-site classroom attendance and with it the essence of the practices, the training potential of the Practicum and the teaching professional identity of the students have been affected during these months, consequences that could affect their future professional practices.","González-Calvo, Gustavo; Bores-García, Daniel; Barba-Martín, Raúl A.; Gallego-Lema, Vanesa",Int.

This helps the government in planning appropriate public health strategies. Therefore, this study intends to explore the perceptions of people towards COVID-19 and their experiences during the pandemic in Nepal. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This qualitative study was conducted among the public in Kathmandu, Kanchanpur, Bajura and Jhapa districts of Nepal. Eight focus group discussions and 40 in-depth interviews were conducted by using a maximum variation sampling method. RESULTS: The findings were organised into the following themes: General understanding of COVID-19, Disease prevention, Source of information and misconceptions, Expectation and challenges; and Personal and societal consequences of COVID-19, social distancing and lockdown. There was a good general understanding among respondents about COVID-19, personal preventive measures and population-level strategies. They responded that the use of masks, sanitisers, handwashing and proper lockdown would help to prevent the disease. The respondents acknowledged the vital role of media in increasing awareness. Participants also expressed concerns over the misleading news spread by some media. The lack of social interaction, isolation and loss of income were raised as pertinent issues by the participants as potentially leading to psychological consequences. Health workers and public both raised concerns over inadequate Personal Protective Equipment, under-prepared health system, unorganised public quarantine centres, and public violation of lockdown CONCLUSIONS: This study reports participants' views on disease prevention measures such as maintaining personal hygiene, adhering to physical distancing, and using personal protective equipments. Additionally, it illuminates the confusion among public due to conflicting public health messages from different sources of information which was deemed as misleading by the participants. This research sheds light on people's perspectives and experiences that can inform population-targeted policies in the future.","Bhatt, Navin; Bhatt, Bandana; Gurung, Soniya; Dahal, Suresh; Jaishi, Amrit Raj; Neupane, Bandana; Budhathoki, Shyam Sundar",BMJ Open,,394

287940,Into the Unknown,2020,"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: The pandemic caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) increased the awareness and efforts to provide care from distance using information technologies. We reviewed the literature about the practice and effectiveness of the rehabilitation of the female pelvic floor dysfunction via telehealth regarding symptomatology and quality of life and function of pelvic floor muscles (PFM). METHODS: A bibliographic review was carried out in May 2020 in the databases: Embase, Medline/PubMed, LILACS and PEDro. A total of 705 articles were reviewed after the removal of duplicates. The methodological quality of the articles was evaluated by the PEDro scale. Two authors performed data extraction into a standardized spreadsheet. RESULTS: Four studies were included, two being randomized controlled trials. Among the RCTs, only one compared telehealth with face-to-face treatment; the second one compared telehealth with postal treatment. The other two studies are follow-up and cost analysis reports on telehealth versus postal evaluation. Data showed that women who received the intervention remotely presented significant improvement in their symptoms, such as reducing the number of incontinence episodes and voiding frequency, improving PFM strength and improving quality of life compared to women who had the face-to-face treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth promoted a significant improvement in urinary symptoms, PFM function and quality of life. Telehealth is still emerging, and more studies are needed to draw more conclusions. The recommendations of the governmental authorities, physical therapy councils and corresponding associations of each country also need to be considered.","da Mata, Kyannie Risame Ueda; Costa, Rafaela Cristina Monica; Carbone, Ébe Dos Santos Monteiro; Gimenez, Márcia Maria; Bortolini, Maria Augusta Tezelli; Castro, Rodrigo Aquino; Fitz, Fátima Faní",Int. urogynecol. j.

DFPP has been used to treat positive-sense RNA virus infections, mainly chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, because of its ability to directly eliminate viral particles from blood plasma from 2008 to about 2015, before direct-acting antiviral agents was marketed. This effect has been termed virus removal and eradication by DFPP. HCV is a positive-sense RNA virus similar to West Nile virus, dengue virus and the SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 is classified same viral species. These viruses are all classified in Family Flaviviridae which are family of single-stranded plus-stranded RNA viruses. Viral particles are 40-60 nm in diameter, enveloped and spherical in shape. We present a rare case of HCV removal where an RNA virus infection that copresented with virus-associated autoimmune hepatitis was eliminated using DFPP. Our results indicate that DFPP may facilitate prompt viraemia reduction and may have novel treatment applications for SARS-CoV-2, that is, use of therapeutic plasma exchange for fulminant COVID-19.","Kamimura, Hiroteru; Kamimura, Kenya; Tsuchiya, Atsunori; Terai, Shuji",BMJ case reports,,394

The aim of the present study is to test the feasibility and safety of a simple, reliable prescription of incremental HD in patients with incident DDKD and RKF. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This parallel-group, open-label randomised pilot trial will enrol 50 patients from 14 outpatient dialysis units. Participants will be randomised (1:1) to receive twice-weekly HD with adjuvant pharmacological therapy for 6 weeks followed by thrice-weekly HD (incremental HD group) or outright thrice-weekly HD (standard HD group). Age &#8805;18 years, chronic kidney disease progressing to DDKD and urine output &#8805;500 mL/day are key inclusion criteria; patients with left ventricular ejection fraction <30% and acute kidney injury requiring dialysis will be excluded. Adjuvant pharmacological therapy (ie, effective diuretic regimen, patiromer and sodium bicarbonate) will complement twice-weekly HD. The primary feasibility end points are recruitment rate, adherence to the assigned HD regimen, adherence to serial timed urine collections and treatment contamination. Incidence rate of clinically significant volume overload and metabolic imbalances in the first 3 months after randomisation will be used to assess intervention safety.

291366,"Covid-19, big data: how it will change the way WE practice medicine",2020,"Since December 2019, the world has been mired in an infectious pandemic that has displaced other health priorities for 21st century populations. Concerned about this situation, Latin American experts on cancer decided to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on cancer control in the region. The analysis was based on information obtained from public sources and scientific publications and included the characteristics of the health care and cancer control prior to the pandemic, the COVID-19 pandemic and measures implemented by the governments of the region, and the regional impact of the pandemic on cancer control together with the costs of cancer care and possible impact of the pandemic on cancer expense. We compared 2019 and 2020 data corresponding to the period March 16-June 30 and found a significant reduction in the number of first-time visits to oncology services (variable depending on the country between -28% and -38%) and a corresponding reduction in pathology (between -6% and -50%), cancer surgery (between -28% and -70%), and chemotherapy (between -2% and -54%). Furthermore, a significant reduction in cancer screening tests was found (PAP smear test studies: between -46% and -100%, mammography: between -32% and -100%, and fecal occult blood test: -73%). If this situation becomes a trend, the health and economic impact will be compounded in the postpandemic period, with an overload of demand on health services to ensure diagnostic tests and consequent treatments. On the basis of this information, a set of prevention and mitigation measures to be immediately implemented and also actions to progressively strengthen health systems are proposed.","Vázquez Rosas, Tabaré; Cazap, Eduardo; Delgado, Lucía; Ismael, Julia; Bejarano, Suyapa; Castro, Carlos; Castro, Hugo; Müller, Bettina; Gutiérrez-Delgado, Francisco; Santini, Luiz Antonio; Vallejos Sologuren, Carlos",JCO Glob Oncol,,394

Aerosol transmission is the most significant mode among the viral transmission mechanisms that do not include physical contact, where airflows carry virus-laden droplets over long distances. Throughout this work, we study the transport of these droplets as a molecular communication problem, where one has no control over the transmission source, but a robust receiver can be designed using bio-sensors. To this end, we present a complete system model and derive an end-to-end mathematical model for the transmission channel under certain constraints and boundary conditions. We derive the system response for both continuous sources such as breathing and jet or impulsive sources such as coughing and sneezing. In addition to transmitter and channel, we assumed a receiver architecture composed of air sampler and Silicon Nanowire field-effect transistor. Then, we formulate a detection problem to maximize the likelihood decision rule and minimize the corresponding missed detection probability. Finally, we present several numerical results to observe the impact of parameters that affect the performance and justify the feasibility of the proposed setup in related applications.","Khalid, Maryam; Amin, Osama; Ahmed, Sajid; Shihada, Basem; Alouini, Mohamed-Slim",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.02116v1.pdf,394

METHODS: An outbreak investigation involving 394 residents and 70 staff, was carried out in 4 nursing homes affected by COVID-19 outbreaks in central London. Two point-prevalence surveys were performed one week apart where residents underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing and had relevant symptoms documented. Asymptomatic staff from three of the four homes were also offered SARS-CoV-2 testing. RESULTS: Overall, 26% (95% CI 22-31) of residents died over the two-month period. All-cause mortality increased by 203% (95% CI 70-336) compared with previous years. Systematic testing identified 40% (95% CI 35-46) of residents as positive for SARS-CoV-2, and of these 43% (95% CI 34-52) were asymptomatic and 18% (95% CI 11-24) had only atypical symptoms; 4% (95% CI -1 to 9) of asymptomatic staff also tested positive.

We conducted 131 semistructured phone interviews with households in rural Odisha, India, to understand behavior changes made in WASH practices as a result of the pandemic and challenges that would prevent best practices. Interviews were conducted from May through July 2020 with 73 heads of household, 37 caregivers of children < 5 years old, and 21 members of village water and sanitation committees in villages with community-level piped water and high levels of latrine ownership. The majority of respondents (86%, N = 104) reported a change in their handwashing practice due to COVID-19, typically describing an increase in handwashing frequency, more thorough washing method, and/or use of soap. These improved handwashing practices remained in place a few months after the pandemic began and were often described as a new consistent practice after additional daily actions (such as returning home), suggesting new habit formation. Few participants (13%) reported barriers to handwashing. Some respondents also detailed improvements in other WASH behaviors, including village-level cleaning of water tanks and/or treatment of piped water (48% of villages), household water treatment and storage (17% of respondents), and household cleaning (41% of respondents). However, there was minimal change in latrine use and child feces management practices as a result of the pandemic. We provide detailed thematic summaries of qualitative responses to allow for richer insights into these WASH behavior changes during the pandemic. The results also highlight the importance of ensuring communities have adequate WASH infrastructure to enable the practice of safe behaviors and strengthen resilience during a large-scale health crisis.","Bauza, Valerie; Sclar, Gloria D; Bisoyi, Alokananda; Majorin, Fiona; Ghugey, Apurva; Clasen, Thomas",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,394
292832,"Teleneurology: Current situation, opportunities and challenges in portugal",2020,"BACKGROUND: Patient travel history can be crucial in evaluating evolving infectious disease events. Such information can be challenging to acquire in electronic health records, as it is often available only in unstructured text. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the feasibility of annotating and automatically extracting travel history mentions from unstructured clinical documents in the Department of Veterans Affairs across disparate health care facilities and among millions of patients. Information about travel exposure augments existing surveillance applications for increased preparedness in responding quickly to public health threats. METHODS: Clinical documents related to arboviral disease were annotated following selection using a semiautomated bootstrapping process. Using annotated instances as training data, models were developed to extract from unstructured clinical text any mention of affirmed travel locations outside of the continental United States. Automated text processing models were evaluated, involving machine learning and neural language models for extraction accuracy. RESULTS: Among 4584 annotated instances, 2659 (58%) contained an affirmed mention of travel history, while 347 (7.6%) were negated. Interannotator agreement resulted in a document-level Cohen kappa of 0.776. Automated text processing accuracy (F1 85.6, 95% CI 82.5-87.9) and computational burden were acceptable such that the system can provide a rapid screen for public health events. CONCLUSIONS: Automated extraction of patient travel history from clinical documents is feasible for enhanced passive surveillance public health systems. Without such a system, it would usually be necessary to manually review charts to identify recent travel or lack of travel, use an electronic health record that enforces travel history documentation, or ignore this potential source of information altogether. The development of this tool was initially motivated by emergent arboviral diseases. More recently, this system was used in the early phases of response to COVID-19 in the United States, although its utility was limited to a relatively brief window due to the rapid domestic spread of the virus. Such systems may aid future efforts to prevent and contain the spread of infectious diseases.","Peterson, Kelly S; Lewis, Julia; Patterson, Olga V; Chapman, Alec B; Denhalter, Daniel W; Lye, Patricia A; Stevens, Vanessa W; Gamage, Shantini D; Roselle, Gary A; Wallace, Katherine S; Jones, Makoto",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,394
292898,Re-imagining Algorithmic Fairness in India and Beyond,2021-01-25,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has undoubtedly disrupted the physical activity (PA) of the Thai population. This study examined the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) of Thai adults and assessed the effects of the national curfew policy and health-promotion campaigns on influencing PA during the pandemic. METHODS: Thailand's Surveillance on Physical Activity (SPA) 2019 and 2020 datasets were employed to compare the PA level of Thai adults aged 18-64 years before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Samples of 4460 respondents from SPA 2019 and 4482 respondents from SPA 2020 were included in the analysis. Global Physical Activity Questionnaires, Version 2.0, were used to measure PA in both periods. Sufficient MVPA for adults was defined based on the recommendation of 75 min of vigorous PA or a combination of 150 min of MVPA per week. RESULTS: The proportion of Thai adults who had sufficient MVPA declined from 74.6% before the pandemic to 54.7% during the pandemic, and that decline was accompanied by a reduction in the cumulative minutes of MVPA from 580 to 420. During the COVID-19 pandemic, male and middle-aged individuals were 1.3 and 1.2 times more likely to have sufficient MVPA, respectively. Those who were unemployed, resided in an urban area, and/or had chronic disease(s) were 27%, 13%, and 27% less likely to meet the recommended level of PA during the pandemic, respectively. Those who were exposed to the Fit from Home campaign were 1.5 times more likely to have sufficient MVPA. CONCLUSION: The pandemic measures imposed by the government have reduced the cumulative min of work-related PA, transportation PA, and recreational PA and have slowed Thailand's progress toward its PA goals. Although the Fit from Home campaign has probably contributed to a slight increase in MVPA, it will take some time for Thais to return to the pre-COVID-19 level of PA. Health promotion messages need to be continuously delivered to reduce irrational fear of infection and to boost the PA level of the Thai population as a health-promoting intervention.","Katewongsa, Piyawat; Widyastari, Dyah Anantalia; Saonuam, Pairoj; Haemathulin, Narumol; Wongsingha, Narakorn",,,394

METHOD: We searched for clinical trial registrations of TCM in the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR) on April 30, 2020. The registration quality assessment is based on the WHO Trial Registration Data Set (Version 1.3.1) and extra items for TCM information, including TCM background, theoretical origin, specific diagnosis criteria, description of intervention, and outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 136 records were examined, including 129 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) and 7 H1N1 influenza (H1N1) patients. The deficiencies in the registration of TCM clinical trials (CTs) mainly focus on a low percentage reporting detailed information about interventions (46.6%), primary outcome(s) (37.7%), and key secondary outcome(s) (18.4%) and a lack of summary result (0%). For the TCM items, none of the clinical trial registrations reported the TCM background and rationale; only 6.6% provided the TCM diagnosis criteria or a description of the TCM intervention; and 27.9% provided TCM outcome(s).

With the development of global economy and the improvement of living standard, the incidence of diabetes is increasing year by year. And it is more common in the elderly. COVID-19 is associated with much chronic disease, especially diabetes. At present, there is no systematic review and meta-analysis of mortality based on large scale of data between diabetes and COVID-19 all over the world. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The databases of PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Wanfang Data, China National Knowledge Infrastructure database (CNKI) and VIP were searched by computer, and the researches related to diabetes mellitus and mortality of COVID-19 were collected. The searching time was from the establishment of the database to April 30 2020. The meta-analysis was carried out by Review Manager Version 5.3 and stata 14.0 software for Mac software after 2 researchers independently selected literature, extracted data and evaluated the bias risk. The main outcome was the mortality of COVID-19 which was included in meta-analysis and subgroup analysis.

296202,The coronavirus crisis and the legitimation crisis of neoliberalism,2020,"BACKGROUND: Patient skepticism concerning medical innovations can have major consequences for current public health and may threaten future progress, which greatly relies on clinical research. The primary objective of this study is to determine the variables associated with patient acceptation or refusal to participate in clinical research. Specifically, we sought to evaluate if distrust in pharmaceutical companies and associated psychosocial factors could represent a recruitment bias in clinical trials and thus threaten the applicability of their results. METHODS: This prospective, multicenter survey consisted in the administration of a self-questionnaire to patients during a pulmonology consultation. The 1025 questionnaires distributed collected demographics, socio-professional and basic health literacy characteristics. Patients were asked to rank their level of trust for pharmaceutical companies and indicate their willingness to participate in different categories of research (pre or post marketing, sponsored by an academic institution or pharmaceutical company). Logistic regression was used to determine factors contributing to ""trust"" versus ""distrust"" group membership and willingness to participate in each category of research. RESULTS: One thousand patients completed the survey, corresponding to a response rate of 97.5%. Data from 838 patients were analyzed in this study. 48.3% of respondents declared that they trusted pharmaceutical companies, while 35.5% declared distrust. Being female (p = 0.042), inactive in the employment market(p = 0.007), and not-knowing the name of one's disease(p = 0.010) are factors related to declared distrust. Distrust-group membership is associated with unwillingness to participate in certain categories of trials such as pre-marketing and industry-sponsored trials. CONCLUSION: Distrust in pharmaceutical companies is associated with a specific patient profile and with refusal to participate in certain subcategories of trials. This potential recruitment bias may explain the under-representation of certain categories of patients such as women in pre-marketing drug trials.","Pahus, Laurie; Suehs, Carey Meredith; Halimi, Laurence; Bourdin, Arnaud; Chanez, Pascal; Jaffuel, Dany; Marciano, Julie; Gamez, Anne-Sophie; Vachier, Isabelle; Molinari, Nicolas",BMC Med Ethics,,394
296578,Leading an effective change strategy,2021,"The aim of this study was to characterize the protein expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and -- 9 and their inhibitors (TIMP-1 and -2) in mammary tissue of dairy cows with naturally occurring chronic S. aureus intramammary infections (IMI) during active involution. Moreover, the gelatinolytic activity of MMP-2 and -9 in mammary secretions was evaluated. Cows in late lactation that were either uninfected or with chronic naturally acquired S. aureus IMI were included in this study. Protein expression of MMP-2 and -9 in mammary tissues was significantly higher in S. aureus-infected than uninfected quarters at day 14 and 21 of involution. Protein expression of TIMP-1 and -2 was significantly higher in S. aureus-infected than uninfected quarters at day 7, 14 and 21 of involution. The MMP-2/TIMP-1, MMP-2/TIMP-2, MMP-9/TIMP-1 and MMP-9/TIMP-2 ratios were significantly higher in S. aureus-infected compared with uninfected quarters at day 14 of involution. The MMP-2 activity was significantly higher in mammary secretions from S. aureus-infected compared with uninfected quarters at day 1, 2, 7 and 14 of involution. The MMP-9 activity was significantly higher in mammary secretions from infected quarters compared with uninfected quarters at day 7, 14 and 21 of involution. The increased expression of MMP-2 and -9 in mammary tissue as well as the high levels of activity observed in mammary secretion from infected quarters compared with uninfected quarters during active involution, strongly suggests that these gelatinases could contribute to degradation of mammary tissue components during chronic S. aureus IMI. The MMPs/TIMPs imbalance could lead to greater proteolysis and potentially more damage to mammary tissue in S. aureus-infected quarters.","Beccaria, Camila; Velázquez, Natalia S; Chervaz, Victoria; Pirola, Silvana I; Baravalle, Celina; Renna, María S; Calvinho, Luis F; Dallard, Bibiana E",Res Vet Sci,,394

297405,An Improved Design of an Adaptive Sliding Mode Controller for Chattering Attenuation and Trajectory Tracking of the Quadcopter UAV,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To analyse the quality of information included in websites aimed at the public on COVID-19. METHODS: Yahoo!, Google and Bing search engines were browsed using selected keywords on COVID-19. The first 100 websites from each search engine for each keyword were evaluated. Validated tools were used to assess readability [Flesch Reading Ease Score (FRES)], usability and reliability (LIDA tool) and quality (DISCERN instrument). Non-parametric tests were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: Eighty-four eligible sites were analysed. The median FRES score was 54.2 (range: 23.2-73.5). The median LIDA usability and reliability scores were 46 (range: 18-54) and 37(range:14-51), respectively. A low (<50 %) overall LIDA score was recorded for 30.9 % (n = 26) of the websites. The median DISCERN score was 49.5 (range: 21-77). The DISCERN score of &#8804;50 % was found in 45 (53.6 %) websites. The DISCERN score was significantly associated with LIDA usability and reliability scores (p < 0.001) and the FRES score (p = 0.024). CONCLUSION: The majority of websites on COVID-19 for the public had moderate to low scores with regards to readability, usability, reliability and quality. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Prompt strategies should be implemented to standardize online health information on COVID-19 during this pandemic to ensure the general public has access to good quality reliable information.","Jayasinghe, Ravindri; Ranasinghe, Sonali; Jayarajah, Umesh; Seneviratne, Sanjeewa",Patient educ. couns,,394

Identifying risk-factors associated with infection and outcomes in cancer patients is necessary to develop healthcare recommendations. METHODS: We analyzed electronic health records of the US Veterans Affairs healthcare system and assessed the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in cancer patients. We evaluated the proportion of cancer patients tested for COVID-19 who were positive, as well as outcome attributable to COVID-19, and stratified by clinical characteristics including demographics, comorbidities, cancer treatment and cancer type. All statistical tests are two-sided. RESULTS: Of 22914 cancer patients tested for COVID-19, 1794 (7.8%) were positive. The prevalence of COVID-19 was similar across age. Higher prevalence was observed in African-American (AA) (15.0%) compared to White (5.5%; P<.001) and in patients with hematologic malignancy compared to those with solid tumors (10.9% vs 7.8%; P<.001). Conversely, prevalence was lower in current smokers and patients who recently received cancer therapy (<6 months). The COVID-19 attributable mortality was 10.9%. Higher attributable mortality rates were observed in older patients, those with higher Charlson comorbidity score, and in certain cancer types. Recent (<6 months) or past treatment did not influence attributable mortality. Importantly, AA patients had 3.5-fold higher COVID-19 attributable hospitalization, however had similar attributable mortality as White patients. CONCLUSION: Pre-existence of cancer affects both susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and eventual outcome. The overall COVID-19 attributable mortality in cancer patients is affected by age, comorbidity and specific cancer types, however, race or recent treatment including immunotherapy does not impact outcome.","Fillmore, Nathanael R; La, Jennifer; Szalat, Raphael E; Tuck, David P; Nguyen, Vinh; Yildirim, Cenk; Do, Nhan V; Brophy, Mary T; Munshi, Nikhil C",J. natl. cancer inst,,394
298899,Monitoring drought events and vegetation dynamics in relation to climate change over mainland China from 1983 to 2016,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Social distancing is crucial in order to flatten the curve of COVID-19 virus spreading. Isolation, scarcity of resources and the lack of social contacts may have produced a negative impact on people's emotions and psychological well-being. This study aims to explore the reasons and the ways through which social distancing generates negative emotions in individuals who experienced the lockdown. To a larger extent, the objective is to check the existence of relations between negative emotions and the satisfaction of basic needs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In Italy 140,656 online interviews were collected from March 22 to April 2, 2020. Data analysis was carried out using mono and bivariate statistical analysis, K-means clustering and the Principal Components Analysis (PCA). The parameters for the identification of six clusters were: the intensity of the respondent's basic emotions and the layers of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. RESULTS: The majority of people involved in an emergency situation, implying a collapse of social contacts, experience some kind of emotional reactions. In our study, we found a correlation between basic emotions and Maslow's hierarchy of needs. In times of crisis, the most basic needs are the physiological ones. Fear, anger and sadness are predominant in all population groups; anger and disgust mainly appear when people are exposed to the risk of not being able to meet subsistence needs, thus perceiving a lack of economic security. CONCLUSIONS: The well-known Maslow's theory of human needs seems to fit well with the outbreak of negative emotions in the context of COVID-19. This study demonstrates the existence of links between negative emotions and primary needs that mainly refer to the first three levels of Maslow's pyramid. As a result of COVID-19 worldwide pandemic, many people have been sucked into the bottom layers of the pyramid. This change in individual basic needs has triggered a relevant transformation in individual emotional status and a shift towards negative emotions.","Cerbara, L; Ciancimino, G; Crescimbene, M; La Longa, F; Parsi, M R; Tintori, A; Palomba, R",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,394
299033,Challenging the Discourse of Leadership as Knowledge: Knowing and Not Knowing,2020,"The emerged Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) causes severe or even fatal respiratory tract infection, and to date there is no FDA-approved therapeutics or effective treatment available to effectively combat this viral infection. This urgent situation is an attractive research area in the field of drug design and development. One of the most important targets of SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS Cov-2) is the main protease (3CLpro). Actinomycetes are important resources for drug discovery. The angucylines that are mainly produced by Streptomyces genus of actinomycetes exhibit a broad range of biological activities such as anticancer, antibacterial and antiviral. This study aims to investigate the binding affinity and molecular interactions of 157 available angucycline compounds with 3CLpro using docking and molecular dynamics simulations. MM-PBSA calculations showed that moromycin A has a better binding energy (- 30.42 kcal mol-1) compared with other ligands (in a range of - 18.66 to - 22.89 kcal mol-1) including saquayamycin K4 (- 21.27 kcal mol-1) except the co-crystallized ligand N3.

299566,"Risk of COVID-19 transmission in esophageal, anorectal manometry and 24-hour impedance-pH monitoring",2021,"Nairobi's urban slums are ill equipped to prevent spread of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) due to high population density, multigenerational families in poorly ventilated informal housing, and poor sanitation. Physical distancing policies, curfews, and a citywide lockdown were implemented in March and April 2020 resulting in sharp decreases in movement across the city. However, most people cannot afford to stay home completely (e.g., leaving daily to fetch water). If still employed, they may need to travel longer distances for work, potentially exposing them COVID-19 or contributing to its spread. We conducted a household survey across five urban slums to describe factors associated with mobility in the previous 24 h. A total of 1695 adults were interviewed, 63% female. Of these, most reported neighborhood mobility within their informal settlement (54%), 19% stayed home completely, and 27% reported long-distance mobility outside their informal settlement, mainly for work. In adjusted multinomial regression models, women were 58% more likely than men to stay home (relative risk ratio (RRR): 1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.16, 2.14) and women were 60% less likely than men to report citywide mobility (RRR: 0.40; 95% CI 0.31, 0.52). Individuals in the wealthiest quintile, particularly younger women, were most likely to not leave home at all. Those who reported citywide travel were less likely to have lost employment (RRR: 0.49; 95% CI 0.38, 0.65) and were less likely to avoid public transportation (RRR: 0.30; 95% CI 0.23, 0.39). Employment and job hunting were the main reasons for traveling outside of the slum; less than 20% report other reasons. Our findings suggest that slum residents who retain their employment are traveling larger distances across Nairobi, using public transportation, and are more likely to be male; this travel may put them at higher risk of COVID-19 infection but is necessary to maintain income. Steps to protect workers from COVID-19 both in the workplace and while in transit (including masks, hand sanitizer stations, and reduced capacity on public transportation) are critical as economic insecurity in the city increases due to COVID-19 mitigation measures. Workers must be able to commute and maintain employment to not be driven further into poverty. Additionally, to protect the majority of individuals who are only travelling locally within their settlement, mitigation measures such as making masks and handwashing stations accessible within informal settlements must also be implemented, with special attention to the burden placed on women.","Pinchoff, Jessie; Kraus-Perrotta, Cara; Austrian, Karen; Tidwell, James B; Abuya, Timothy; Mwanga, Daniel; Kangwana, Beth; Ochako, Rhoune; Muluve, Eva; Mbushi, Faith; Nzioki, Mercy; Ngo, Thoai D",J. urban health,,394

Rapid antigen tests (RAT), though less sensitive than RT-PCR, offer the possibility of rapid, inexpensive and early detection of the most infectious COVID-19 cases. Only very few studies have assessed the performance of the Abbott Panbio COVID-19 RAT among asymptomatic people or in Latin America. This study set out to validate this test among people attending the public test street in Sint Maarten, Dutch Caribbean. MethodsPeople of all ages were recruited from the public COVID-19 test street regardless of COVID-19 symptoms. They received a nasopharyngeal swab for the Abbott Panbio COVID-19 RAT and the RT-PCR Qtower. Diagnostic accuracy of the RAT was compared to the RT-PCR among the overall study population and for subgroups with/without symptoms, with/without close contact and different Ct values. ResultsUsing a RT-PCR Ct cut-off value of <33, 119 out of 1,411 people (8.4%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Most were asymptomatic (59%). The overall sensitivity and specificity of the RAT was 84% (95% CI 76.2-90.1) and 99.9% (95% CI 99.6-100) respectively. The sensitivity reduced to 67.6% (95% CI: 49.5%, 82.6%) among people without symptoms, regardless of whether they were in close contact with a known COVID-19 case. Sensitivity reduced considerably with a Ct cut-off value of <35. ConclusionsThe Abbott Panbio RAT is a valid and cheaper alternative to RT-PCR when used on symptomatic individuals among the general population. However, among asymptomatic people it should not be used as a stand-alone test and negative results should be confirmed with RT-PCR.","King, Colin; Weever, Eva Lista-de; Henry, Maria; Steingrover, Radjin; Fleming, Chérina; Panneflek, Richard; Kampen, Sanne van",,,394

302931,Challenges to the Liberal Order: Reflections on International Organization,2021,"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Voiding symptoms/dysfunctions (VS/Ds) after surgery for deep-infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) are frequent (20% of patients) and, together with bowel dysfunctions, may represent a de novo disorder due to surgical damage of the pelvic plexus or a worsening of pre-existent functional damage. Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) might improve voiding symptoms by treating dysfunctional voiding. The aim of this study is to report our experience with SNM in patients treated with surgery for DIE. METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 13 patients with VS/Ds after surgery for DIE. All patients were investigated with urodynamic studies (UDS) and agreed to undergo SNM. Pre-existing VS/Ds, bowel disorders and pelvic pain, DIE surgical procedures, UDS and SNM test results were recorded. RESULTS: After surgery for DIE, functional bladder outflow obstruction and detrusor acontractility were observed in nine and four patients, respectively. Chronic pelvic pain was present in seven cases. Twelve patients developed constipation, whilst one patient had de novo faecal incontinence. After the SNM testing period, nine patients (69.2%) experienced a significant improvement of symptoms that led to definitive implant. Four patients (30.8%) had no symptom relief and the system was removed. CONCLUSIONS: Functional bladder outflow obstruction and urinary retention are the most common VS/Ds after surgery for DIE. SNM may be an effective option for these patients, probably due to its action in improving the dysfunctional voiding, which was likely to be already present as part of the ""endometriotic syndrome"" and got worse after pelvic surgery. Results for pelvic pain control and gastrointestinal disorders should not be underestimated.","Agnello, Marco; Vottero, Mario; Bertapelle, Paola",Int. urogynecol. j. (Print),,394

303681,A topic modeling framework for spatio-temporal information management,2020,"Filter facepiece respirators (FFRs) are critical for preventing the transmission of respiratory tract infection disease, especially the dreadful coronavirus 2 (SARs-CoV-2). The N95 mask is a prototype, high-efficiency protective device that can effectively protect against airborne pathogens of less than 0.3 µm. The N95 mask is tightly fitting and has high filtration capacity. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to a greater requirement for FFR. This rising demand greatly exceeds current production capabilities and stockpiles, resulting in shortages. To address this, our team has invented a new type of half-piece respirator made from silicone and assembled with HEPA or elastostatic filter. A variety of methods have been used to evaluate this new device, including a qualitative fit test with the Bitrex® test kit and filtration test. The preliminary results showed that the new elastometric respirators pass the fit test. The filtration tests also confirmed the superiority of the new respirator over traditional N95 masks, with a mean performance of protection greater than 95%. For the filters, we used two types: SafeStar, which is a kind of HEPA filter; and CareStar, which is considered an elastostatic filler. CareStar was developed to filter virus and bacteria in the operating room, with a limit duration of use up to 24 h, while the safe star was designed for 72 h use and has the quality equivalent to a HEPA filter. Our study demonstrated superior filtration efficacy of both filters, more than 98% even after 24 h of use. CareStar has significantly more filtration efficacy than a safe star (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the development of our new N99 half-piece respirator should ultimately be applicable to healthcare workers with at least non-inferiority to the previously used N 95 respirators. As a universal masking policy is generally implemented, health care workers who are at risk must be protected with appropriate devices. Currently, the adequate supply of such equipment is not feasible. The advent of the new protective device will help protect healthcare workers and replenish the shortage of N95 respirators during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Manomaipiboon, Anan; Pupipatpab, Sujaree; Chomdee, Pongsathorn; Chitsomkasem, Anusang; Apichatbutr, Yutthana; Boonyapatkul, Pathiporn; Trakarnvanich, Thananda",PLoS One,,394

Method: A survey questionnaire consisting of post-traumatic stress disorder self-rating scale (PTSD-SS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), and self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) was presented to COVID-19 survivors still in quarantine. Scores of each scale and subscale were dependent variables in the Mann-Whitney test and stepwise regression analysis. Results: A total of 126 subjects were included in the study, the mean scores of PTSD-SS, SDS, and SAS were 45.5 +/- 18.9, 47.3 +/- 13.1, and 43.2 +/- 10.2, respectively, meanwhile, 9 (31.0%), 28 (22.2%), and 48 (38.1%) of the survivors met the cut-score for clinical significant symptoms of stress response, anxiety, and depression, respectively. Infected family members, and postinfection physical discomforts were significantly associated with scores on all three scales. Social support, retirement, and being female had significant associations with the PTSD-SS score. The survivors aged 60 or above experienced less severe stress response symptoms, fewer emotional symptoms of depression, and fewer anxiety symptoms than younger survivors. Conclusion: The occurrence rate of psychological distress among the COVID-19 survivors in early convalescence was high, highlighting the need for all COVID-19 survivors to be screened for psychological distress regularly for timely intervention. The predictors indicated by the current study may help to identify those at high-risk. Besides, the results indicated the older survivors suffered less emotional reactivity and fewer stress response symptoms from infectious diseases than the younger ones.

304307,Learning to Spot False or Misleading Prescription Drug Promotion,2020,"Stochastic epidemic models (SEMs) fit to incidence data are critical to elucidating outbreak transmission dynamics, shaping response strategies, and preparing for future epidemics. SEMs typically represent counts of individuals in discrete infection states using Markov jump processes (MJP), but are computationally challenging as imperfect surveillance, lack of subject-level information, and temporal coarseness of the data obscure the true epidemic. Analytic integration over the latent epidemic process is generally impossible, and integration via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is cumbersome due to the dimensionality and discreteness of the latent state space. Simulation-based computational approaches can address the intractability of the MJP likelihood, but are numerically fragile and prohibitively expensive for complex models. A linear noise approximation (LNA) that replaces the MJP transition density with a Gaussian density has been explored for analyzing prevalence data in large-population settings. Existing LNA frameworks are inappropriate for incidence data and depend on simulation-based methods or an assumption that disease counts are normally distributed. We demonstrate how to reparameterize a SEM to properly analyze incidence data, and fold the LNA into a data augmentation MCMC framework that outperforms deterministic methods, statistically, and simulation-based methods, computationally. Our framework is computationally robust when the model dynamics are complex and can be applied to a broad class of SEMs. We apply our method to national-level surveillance counts from the 2013--2015 West Africa Ebola outbreak, modeling within-country transmission and importation of infections from neighboring countries.","Fintzi, Jonathan; Wakefield, Jon; Minin, Vladimir N.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.05099v1.pdf,394

(Special Issue: Sport and the coronavirus crisis.),2020,"Hackathons are events in which diverse teams work together to explore, and develop solutions, software or even ideas. Hackathons have been recognized not only as public events for hacking, but also as a corporate mechanism for innovation. Hackathons are a way for established companies to achieve increased employee wellbeing as well as being a curator for innovation and developing new products. Sudden transition to the work-from-home mode caused by the COVID-19 pandemic first put many corporate events requiring collocation, such as hackathons, temporarily on hold and then motivated companies to find ways to hold these events virtually. In this paper, we report our findings from investigating hackathons in the context of a large agile company by first exploring the general benefits and challenges of hackathons and then trying to understand how they were affected by the virtual setup. We conducted nine interviews, surveyed 23 employees and analyzed a hackathon demo. We found that hackathons provide both individual and organizational benefits of innovation, personal interests, and acquiring new skills and competences. Several challenges such as added stress due to stopping the regular work, employees fearing not having enough contribution to deliver and potential mismatch between individual and organizational goals were also found. With respect to the virtual setup, we found that virtual hackathons are not diminishing the innovation benefits, however, some negative effect surfaced on the social and networking side.","Ulfsnes, Rasmus; Stray, Viktoria; Moe, Nils Brede; vSmite, Darja",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.00309v1.pdf,394

METHODS: Digital databases were queried to study the safety of RAASi in COVID-19. The primary outcome of interest was mortality. The secondary outcome was seropositivity improvement/viral clearance, clinical manifestation progression, and progression to intensive care units. A random-effect model was used to compute an unadjusted odds ratio (OR). RESULTS: A total of 49 observational studies were included in the analysis consisting of 83,269 COVID-19 patients (RAASi n = 34,691; non-RAASi n = 48,578). The mean age of the sample was 64, and 56% were males. We found that RAASi was associated with similar mortality outcomes as compared to non-RAASi groups (OR 1.07; 95% CI 0.99-1.15; p > 0.05). RAASi was associated with seropositivity improvement including negative RT-PCR or antibodies, (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.93-0.99; p < 0.05). There was no association between RAASi versus control with progression to ICU admission (OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.79-1.23; p > 0.05) or higher odds of worsening of clinical manifestations (OR 1.04; 95% CI 0.97-1.11; p > 0.05). Metaregression analysis did not change our outcomes for effect modifiers including age, sex, comorbidities, RAASi type, or study type on outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is not a contraindication to hold or discontinue RAASi as they are not associated with higher mortality or worsening symptoms. Continuation of RAASi might be associated with favorable outcomes in COVID-19, including seropositivity/viral clearance.","Sattar, Yasar; Mukuntharaj, Pradeeksha; Zghouzi, Mohamed; Suleiman, Abdul-Rahman M; Attique, Hassan; Ullah, Waqas; Sana, Muhammad Khawar; Zaher, Nathan; Mehmood, Maham; Doshi, Rajkumar P; Panchal, Ankur; Mir, Tanveer; Nadeem, Muhammad; Ali, Omar E; Mohamed, Mohamad; Bagur, Rodrigo; Elgendy, Islam Y; Mamas, Mamas A; Alraies, M Chadi",High Blood Press Cardiovasc Prev,,394

Discussion at the workshop focused on the implications of viral evolution and genomic variability for vaccine and therapeutics development in the context of various immunization strategies. This paper summarizes the meeting, highlights research gaps and future priorities, and outlines what has been achieved since the meeting took place. It concludes with an examination of what the RSV community can learn from our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 genomics and what insights over sixty years of RSV research can offer the rapidly evolving field of COVID-19 vaccines.","Kim, Sonnie; Williams, Thomas C; Viboud, Cecile; Campbell, Harry; Chen, Jiani; Spiro, David J",Vaccine,,394

We report a novel method for studying the dynamics of Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacterial transit through the worms' intestine. A microfluidic chip was designed for alternating C. elegans on-chip culture and immobilization, thereby enabling periodic high-resolution time-lapse imaging at single-worm resolution over several days. Immobilization was achieved in a reversible way using arrays of tapered channels suitable for assay parallelization. Dedicated C. elegans feeding protocols were applied. Two E. coli bacterial strains, HT115 and OP50, respectively labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and red fluorescent protein (RFP), were used as food source and imaged with fluorescence microscopy techniques to measure relevant parameters of the bacterial transit process. Feeding behavior and E. coli transit dynamics in the whole intestinal tract of the worms were characterized in an automated way over the first 3 days of adulthood, revealing both fast transit phenomena and variations in microbial accumulation. In particular, we studied the bacterial food transit periodicity in wild-type and eat-2 (ad465) mutant C. elegans strains in both trapped and free-swimming conditions. In order to further demonstrate the versatility of our microfluidic platform, we also studied drug-induced modifications of the bacterial transit by measuring the response of the worms' intestine to exposure to the neurotransmitter serotonin.","Viri, Vittorio; Cornaglia, Matteo; Atakan, Huseyin Baris; Lehnert, Thomas; Gijs, Martin A M",,,394

We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis to examine whether physical activity is protective for AD. METHODS: Summary data of genome-wide association studies on physical activity and AD were used. The primary study population included 21,982 AD cases and 41,944 cognitively normal controls. Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) known at P<5x10-8 to be associated with 'average accelerations' and eight SNPs associated at P<5x10-7 with vigorous physical activity ('fraction of accelerations >425 milli-gravities') served as instrumental variables. RESULTS: There was no association between genetically predicted 'average accelerations' with the risk of AD (inverse variance weighted odds ratio [OR] per standard deviation (SD) increment: 1.03, 95% confidence interval: 0.97-1.10, P=0.332). Genetic liability for 'fraction of accelerations >425 milli-gravities' was unrelated to AD risk.

312201,"Structural Model to Determine the Factors That Affect the Quality of Emergency Teaching, According to the Perception of the Student of the First University Courses",2021,"BACKGROUND: In late December 2019 and on 1st January 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) infecting humans was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Later cases have also been confirmed worldwide. Coronaviruses are RNA viruses that are phenotypically and genotypically diverse. Globally, as of 6th April 2020, laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) amounted to 1 211 214, including 67 666 deaths. AIM: In the current study, we performed a literature review on coronavirus outbreak to summarise details about the pathogenesis, epidemiology, diagnosis and the management strategies for the disease control. PATHOGENESIS: Coronaviruses are tremendously precise and mature only in differentiated respiratory epithelial cells, as seen in both organ cultures as well as human volunteers. This virus will cause the antiviral T-cell response to be erratic, owing to the T-cell apoptosis activation, triggering the immune system to collapse. TRANSMISSION: The understanding of the transmission of COVID-19 risk is incomplete. The transmission mainly occurs through the respiratory droplets once an infected person sneezes, like the spread of flu and other respiratory infectious agents. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Presentations of COVID-19 includes fever, cough, shortness of breath, malaise and respiratory distress. TREATMENT: There have been no approved vaccines available for COVID-19 until today. The Ministry of Science and Technology in the People's Republic of China declared three potential antiviral medicines suitable for treating COVID-19. Those three medicines are, namely, favilavir, chloroquine phosphate and remdesivir. Hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin enhances the reduction of the viral load in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: The corona virus transmits quicker than its two predecessors the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but has reduced casualty. The global effects of this latest pandemic are still unclear. Nevertheless, considering that so far no vaccine has been available; preventive approaches are the best way to fight against the virus.","Almaghaslah, Dalia; Kandasamy, Geetha; Almanasef, Mona; Vasudevan, Rajalakshimi; Chandramohan, Sriram",Int J Clin Pract,,394
312507,Partha Kar: Our approach to tackling obesity needs rethinking,2020,"BACKGROUND: Given the public health responses to previous pandemics of respiratory diseases, and in the absence of treatments and vaccines, the mitigation of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) relies on population engagement in non-pharmaceutical interventions. Engagement is largely driven by risk perception, anxiety level and knowledge, as well as historical exposure to disease outbreaks, government responses and cultures. OBJECTIVE: To compare psycho-behavioral responses in Hong Kong (HK) and the United Kingdom (UK) during the early phase of the pandemic. METHODS: Comparable cross-sectional surveys were administered among adults in HK and the UK during the early phase of each respective epidemic. Explanatory variables included demographics, risk perception, knowledge of COVID-19, anxiety level and preventive behaviors. Responses were weighted according to census data. Logistic regression models, including effect modification to quantify setting differences, were used to assess the association between explanatory variables and the adoption of social-distancing measures. RESULTS: Data of 3431 complete responses (HK:1663; UK:1768) were analysed. Perceived severity differed by setting (HK: 96.8%; UK: 19.9%). A large proportion of respondents were abnormally/borderline anxious (HK:60.0%; UK:46.5%) and regarded direct contact with infected individuals as the transmission route of COVID-19 (HK:94.0-98.5%; UK:69.2-93.5%), with HK identifying additional routes. HK reported high levels of adoption of social-distancing (HK:32.6-93.7%; UK:17.6-59.0%) and mask-wearing (HK:98.8%; UK:3.1%). The impact of perceived severity and perceived ease of transmission on the adoption of social-distancing varied by setting. In HK, they had no impact, whereas in the UK, those who perceived severity as ""high"" were more likely to adopt social-distancing (aOR:1.58-3.01), and those who perceived transmission as ""easy"" were prone to both general social-distancing (aOR:2.00, 95% CI:1.57, 2.55) and contact avoidance (aOR:1.80, 95% CI: 1.41, 2.30). The impact of anxiety on adopting social-distancing did not vary by setting. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that health officials should ascertain baseline levels of risk perception and knowledge in the populations, as well as prior sensitisation to infectious disease outbreaks, during the development of mitigation strategies. Risk communication should be done through suitable media channels - and trust should be maintained - while early intervention remains the cornerstone of effective outbreak response.

313049,Konseling Indigenous Dalam Masa New Normal,2020,"AimsTo assess concordance with guidelines on monitoring vitamin D levels and prescribing prophylaxis or replacement. To assess the association between the implementation of local guidelines and prevalence of vitamin D deficiency.BackgroundVitamin D deficiency is associated with various adverse health outcomes including osteoporosis, fractures and myalgia. Most recently, vitamin D deficiency has been hypothesised as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 infection. Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency include incarceration, ethnicity, diet and a diagnosis of psychiatric disorder. Vitamin D deficiency is known to be prevalent among individuals within forensic mental health institutions.Local Trust guidelines advise that vitamin D levels should be checked within one-month of hospital admission, followed by checks at three-monthly intervals. Recommendations for prescribing depend on patients’ vitamin D levels;deficient (&lt;25nmol/L), insufficient (25 &lt; 50nmol/L) or adequate (50-150nmol/L). We assessed concordance with these guidelines at Broadmoor Hospital, UK.MethodMedical records, laboratory results and drug charts were assessed for a total of 75 patients across 15 wards. Data were collected using a standardised audit tool, including;date of admission, admission vitamin D level, most recent vitamin D level and the dose and frequency of vitamin D prescribed.Result76.4% of patients had their vitamin D levels checked within one month of admission. 66.7% of patients had their vitamin D checked within the last 3 months. For patients with an admission vitamin D level recorded, 43.6% had deficient vitamin D levels, 43.6% had insufficient levels and 12.7% had adequate levels. For patients with a more recent serum vitamin D level, 14.5% had deficient levels, 38.7% had insufficient levels and 46.8% had adequate levels. For patients with a documented serum vitamin D level, 21.4% were prescribed the correct dose, 22.9% were under-dosed, 14.3% were over-dosed and 41.4% received no dose where guidelines suggested they should.ConclusionComparison of admission and most recent vitamin D levels suggests a general improvement in prevalence of vitamin D deficiency associated with the implementation of local guidelines. However, we identify significant areas for improvement. A substantial proportion of patients lacked admission or regular monitoring of vitamin D levels and a substantial proportion of patients were under-dosed or received no dose where guidelines suggested they should have. We propose that better concordance with guidelines may improve clinical outcomes further. This may prove especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic, given a potential association between vitamin D deficiency and severity of respiratory infection.","Gillett, George Chudleigh-Warren Samantha Hardy Benedict Gordon Charles Robert",BJPsych Open,,394
313063,Deindustrijalizacija I Njezin Utjecaj Na Ublažavanje Buduće Krize - Slučaj Europske Unije,2020,"BACKGROUND: Existing health disparities based on race and ethnicity in the United States are contributing to disparities in morbidity and mortality during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. We conducted an online survey of American adults to assess similarities and differences by race and ethnicity with respect to COVID-19 symptoms, estimates of the extent of the pandemic, knowledge of control measures, and stigma. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe similarities and differences in COVID-19 symptoms, knowledge, and beliefs by race and ethnicity among adults in the United States. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey from March 27, 2020 through April 1, 2020. Participants were recruited on social media platforms and completed the survey on a secure web-based survey platform. We used chi-square tests to compare characteristics related to COVID-19 by race and ethnicity. Statistical tests were corrected using the Holm Bonferroni correction to account for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: A total of 1435 participants completed the survey; 52 (3.6%) were Asian, 158 (11.0%) were non-Hispanic Black, 548 (38.2%) were Hispanic, 587 (40.9%) were non-Hispanic White, and 90 (6.3%) identified as other or multiple races. Only one symptom (sore throat) was found to be different based on race and ethnicity (P=.003); this symptom was less frequently reported by Asian (3/52, 5.8%), non-Hispanic Black (9/158, 5.7%), and other/multiple race (8/90, 8.9%) participants compared to those who were Hispanic (99/548, 18.1%) or non-Hispanic White (95/587, 16.2%). Non-Hispanic White and Asian participants were more likely to estimate that the number of current cases was at least 100,000 (P=.004) and were more likely to answer all 14 COVID-19 knowledge scale questions correctly (Asian participants, 13/52, 25.0%; non-Hispanic White participants, 180/587, 30.7%) compared to Hispanic (108/548, 19.7%) and non-Hispanic Black (25/158, 15.8%) participants. CONCLUSIONS: We observed differences with respect to knowledge of appropriate methods to prevent infection by the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Deficits in knowledge of proper control methods may further exacerbate existing race/ethnicity disparities. Additional research is needed to identify trusted sources of information in Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black communities and create effective messaging to disseminate correct COVID-19 prevention and treatment information.","Jones, Jeb; Sullivan, Patrick S; Sanchez, Travis H; Guest, Jodie L; Hall, Eric W; Luisi, Nicole; Zlotorzynska, Maria; Wilde, Gretchen; Bradley, Heather; Siegler, Aaron J",J Med Internet Res,,394

We propose a simple definition for the External Validity (EV) of Interventions, Counterfactual statements and Samples. We use the definition to discuss several issues that have baffled the counterfactual approach to effect estimation: out-of-sample validity, reliance on independence assumptions or estimation, concurrent estimation of many effects and full-models, bias-variance tradeoffs, statistical power, omitted variables, and connections to supervised and explaining techniques. Methodologically, the definition also allow us to replace the parametric and generally ill-posed estimation problems that followed the counterfactual definition by combinatorial enumeration problems on non-experimental samples. We use over 20 contemporary methods and simulations to demonstrate that the approach leads to accuracy gains in standard out-of-sample prediction, intervention effect prediction and causal effect estimation tasks. The COVID19 pandemic highlighted the need for learning solutions to provide general predictions in small samples - many times with missing variables. We also demonstrate applications in this pressing problem.","Ribeiro, Andre F.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.04376v1.pdf,394

Lower limb point-of-care clinical ultrasound (POCUS) could detect occult clots, helping decide whom to treat with anticoagulation. OBJECTIVES: To determine proximal DVT prevalence with POCUS screening among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. PATIENTS/METHODS: Lower limb POCUS was performed in all patients admitted either to the ward or intensive care unit (ICU) between April 22nd and 30th 2020. Clinical and laboratory features, prescriptions, thrombotic complications and outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: 87 patients were screened, of which 26 (29.8%) either had been discharged from ICU (19.5%) or were still in critical condition (10.3%). DVT was found in 4 patients (3 femoral, 1 popliteal), of which 1 had not received low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) prophylaxis. 21 CT pulmonary angiograms were performed, being positive for PE in 5 cases (23.8%); only 2 of these patients suffered DVT. CONCLUSIONS: Screening lower extremities with POCUS did not find a high rate of DVT among patients receiving LMWH-prophylaxis. However, there was a noteworthy amount of PE without DVT.","García-Ceberino, Pedro M; Faro-Míguez, Naya; Beltrán-Ávila, Francisco Javier; Fernández-Reyes, Daniel; Gallardo-Muñoz, Inmaculada; Guirao-Arrabal, Emilio",Med. clin (Ed. impr.),,394

Design/methodology/approach: The data of the retailers operating in different formats in the first two quarters of 2018–2020 are used in the study. The data are analyzed by using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The inputs of the DEA model are personnel expenses, rent costs and advertising expenses;and the outputs are sales and profits, which are the main objective of businesses. Because of the structure of the data, the non-oriented approach is used. The efficiency of retailers is determined in the study with super efficiency, which allows retailers to rank their productivity. Findings: Findings of study present that consumers exhibited price-oriented behaviors during economic recession periods. DEA findings shows that discount stores are the most efficient retailers. However, study findings also reveal that retailers who support cost-reduction strategies with promotion activities are more efficient than others during economic recession periods. Practical implications: Recommendations are made for the decision makers of the retailers in line with the findings of the study. Originality/value: The study contributes to the literature by evaluating the consumer preferences and the efficiency of retailers in COVID-19 outbreak period, which is one of the most special periods in world history. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Baran, T.",Journal of Islamic Marketing,,394

AIM: To explore bereaved relatives' experiences of quality of care and family support provided during the last days of life; to identify the impact of factors associated with perceived support. DESIGN: A national, observational, open online survey was developed and disseminated via social media, public fora and professional networks (June-September 2020). Validated instruments and purposively designed questions assessed experiences. Analysis used descriptive statistics, logistic regression and thematic analysis of free-text responses. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals (â©¾18 years) who had experienced the death of a relative/friend (all care settings) within the United Kingdome during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Respondents (n = 278, mean 53.4 years) tended to be female (n = 216, 78%); over half were 'son/daughter' (174, 62.6%) to the deceased. Deceased individuals (mean 81.6 years) most frequently died in their 'usual place of care' (n = 192, 69.3%). Analysis established five conceptual themes affecting individualised care: (1) public health restrictions compounding the distress of 'not knowing'; (2) disparate views about support from doctors and nurses; (3) challenges in communication and level of preparedness for the death; (4) delivery of compassionate care; (5) emotional needs and potential impact on grief. Male respondents (OR 2.9, p = 0.03) and those able to visit (OR 2.2, p = 0.04) were independently associated with good perceptions of family support. CONCLUSION: Despite public health restrictions, individualised care can be enabled by proactive, informative communication; recognising dying in a timely manner and facilitating the ability to be present before death.","Mayland, Catriona R; Hughes, Rosemary; Lane, Steven; McGlinchey, Tamsin; Donnellan, Warren; Bennett, Kate; Hanna, Jeffrey; Rapa, Elizabeth; Dalton, Louise; Mason, Stephen R",Palliat Med,,394

Nowadays, efforts in PAK4 inhibitor development are focusing on improving inhibitory selectivity, cellular potency, and in vivo pharmacokinetic properties, and identifying the feasibility of immunotherapy combination in oncology therapy.Areas covered: This review summarized the development of PAK4 inhibitors that reported on patents in the past two decades. According to their binding features, these inhibitors were classified into type I, type I 1/2, and PAMs. Their designing ideas and SAR were elucidated in this review. Moreover, synergistic therapy of PAK4 inhibitors with PD-1/PD-L1 or CAR-T were also summarized .Expert opinion: In the past years, preclinical and clinical studies of PAK4 inhibitors ended in failure due to poor selectivity, cellular activity, or pharmacokinetic issues.

For multivariate functionals such as multiple moments, quantiles, or the pair (Value at Risk, Expected Shortfall), this one-to-one relation fails and not every identification function possesses an antiderivative. The most important implication is an efficiency gap: The most efficient Z-estimator often outperforms the most efficient M-estimator.

323572,US Supplement Sales Rise Sharply during First Six Months of 2020,2020,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the mental state of medical staff and medical students in the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, as well as analyze the risk factors of serious mental illness (SMI), so as to provide a scientific basis for further psychological intervention and management. METHOD: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from February 2-7, 2020. The Kessler 6 Psychological Distress Scale and a general information questionnaire were administered on-line to a convenience sample of 548 medical staff and medical students in China. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was used to screen the risk factors of SMI in medical staff and medical students. RESULTS: Of the 505 respondents in the final analysis, 188 (37.23%) were at high risk of SMI. Respondents were at significantly higher risk of SMI if they had been suspected of being infected with the SARS-CoV-2 (OR = 7.00, 95% CI: 1.19-41.14), had relatives suspected of being infected with the SARS-CoV-2 (OR = 23.60, 95% CI: 1.11-501.30), felt concerned towards media coverage of outbreak-related information (OR = 11.95, 95% CI: 3.07-46.57), recently dreamed related to SARS-CoV-2 (OR = 4.21, 95% CI: 2.22-8.01), experienced difficulty in controlling emotions during SARS-CoV-2 epidemic (OR = 3.25, 95% CI: 1.66-6.37), or spent hours watching outbreaks per day (OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.13-1.46). CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight that medical staff and medical students were vulnerable to SMI during the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and identify the factors associated with SMI which can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health. The independent risk factors for SMI among them are suspicion that they or relatives were infected with the SARS-CoV-2, greater interest in media reports about the epidemic, frequency of recent dreams related to SARS-CoV-2, difficulty in controlling emotions during the epidemic, and hours spent watching outbreaks per day.","Wu, Shuang; Li, Zhe; Li, Zhixiong; Xiang, Weiyi; Yuan, Yiwen; Liu, Yaya; Xiong, Zhenzhen",Compr Psychiatry,,394

This study aimed to provide early estimates of how stress and demographics will interact with shifts in harmful alcohol consumption from before the COVID-19 outbreak to 2 months into social distancing. DESIGN: Cross-sectional convenience sample. SETTING: Australia. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1684 Australians aged 18-65 years who drink at least monthly. MEASUREMENTS: Items from the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and the stress subscale of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS). FINDINGS: Overall, harmful drinking decreased during social distancing measures in our sample [2019 score = 8.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 7.9-8.4; during the pandemic = 7.3, 95% CI = 7.1-7.6]. Younger drinkers, particularly young women, decreased their consumption the most, but there was a small increase in consumption in middle-aged women. Drinkers experiencing high levels of stress also reported a relatively higher shift in harmful consumption compared with those with low levels of stress (ß = 0.65, P = 0.003), despite reporting a small decrease overall. CONCLUSIONS: The closure of licensed premises and social distancing measures in Australia in response to the COVID-19 outbreak appear to have reduced harmful alcohol consumption in younger drinkers, particularly young women.","Callinan, Sarah; Smit, Koen; Mojica-Perez, Yvette; D039,; Aquino, Simon; Moore, David; Kuntsche, Emmanuel",Addiction,,394

The current study aimed to further examine the possible impact of a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection on in hospital mortality. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of health insurance claims data from the second largest insurance fund in Germany, BARMER. Patients hospitalised for ST elevation (STEMI) and non-ST elevation (NSTEMI) myocardial infarction, acute limb ischaemia (ALI), aortic rupture, acute stroke, or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) between 1 January 2017, and 31 October 2020, were included. Admission rates per 10 000 insured and mortality were compared between March - June 2017 - 2019 (pre-COVID) and March - June 2020 (COVID). Mortality rates were determined by the occurrence of a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: A total of 316 718 hospitalisations were included (48.7% female, mean 72.5 years), and 21 191 (6.7%, 95% CI 6.6% - 6.8%) deaths occurred. In hospital mortality increased during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared with the three previous years for patients with acute stroke from 8.3% (95% CI 8.0 - 8.5) to 9.6% (95% CI 9.1 - 10.2), while no statistically significant changes were observed for STEMI, NSTEMI, ALI, aortic rupture, and TIA. When comparing patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (2.4%, 95% CI 2.3 - 2.5) vs. non-infected patients, a higher in hospital mortality was observed for acute stroke (12.4% vs. 9.0%), ALI (14.3% vs. 5.0%), and TIA (2.7% vs. 0.3%), while no statistically significant differences were observed for STEMI, NSTEMI, and aortic rupture. CONCLUSION: This retrospective analysis of claims data has provided hints of an association between the COVID-19 pandemic and increased in hospital mortality in patients with acute stroke. Furthermore, confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with increased mortality in patients with stroke, TIA, and ALI. Future studies are urgently needed to better understand the underlying mechanism and relationship between the new coronavirus and acute stroke.","Behrendt, Christian-Alexander; Seiffert, Moritz; Gerloff, Christian; L039,; Hoest, Helmut; Acar, Laura; Thomalla, Götz",Eur. j. vasc. endovasc. surg,,394

(Special Issue: Sport and the coronavirus crisis.),2020,"The treatment of respiratory tract infections is threatened by the emergence of bacterial resistance. Immunomodulatory drugs, which enhance airway innate immune defenses, may improve therapeutic outcome. In this concept paper, we aim to highlight the utility of pharmacometrics and Bayesian inference in the development of immunomodulatory therapeutic agents as an adjunct to antibiotics in the context of pneumonia. For this, two case studies of translational modelling and simulation frameworks are introduced for these types of drugs up to clinical use. First, we evaluate the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship of an experimental combination of amoxicillin and a TLR4 agonist, monophosphoryl lipid A, by developing a pharmacometric model accounting for interaction and potential translation to humans. Capitalizing on this knowledge and associating clinical trial extrapolation and statistical modelling approaches, we then investigate the TLR5 agonist flagellin. The resulting workflow combines expert and prior knowledge on the compound with the in vitro and in vivo data generated during exploratory studies in order to construct high-dimensional models considering the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the compound. This workflow can be used to refine preclinical experiments, estimate the best doses for human studies, and create an adaptive knowledge-based design for the next phases of clinical development.","Michelet, Robin Moreno Ursino Boulet Sandrine Franck Sebastian Casilag Fiordiligie Baldry Mara Rolff Jens Madelé van Dyk Wicha Sebastian G.; Sirard, Jean-Claude Comets Emmanuelle Zohar Sarah Kloft Charlotte",Pharmaceutics,,394

327265,Risk Management in the System of Tourist Business Control,2021,"Introduction: It is unclear how the interventions designed to restrict community and in-hospital exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus affected the care for stroke patients seeking acute treatment. The objective of the following study was to determine the impact COVID-19 has had on the treatment times for patients evaluated as acute stroke alerts at Baptist Hospital of Miami (BHM). A co-primary objective of the study was to assess the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 within 2 weeks from hospital discharge. Methods: This retrospective, two phase study was conducted between December 2019 and April 2020. In phase one, we assessed time from symptom onset to hospital arrival, number of strokes with witnessed onset, and in-hospital treatment times pre & post implementation of Covid-19 preventive exposure measures. In phase two of the study, a telephone survey was conducted on the post implementation group to assess the risk of patients developing symptoms or testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 from hospital admission up to two weeks post discharge. Results: Phase I demonstrated there was a 40% decline in stroke volume, but no significant delay to seek medical attention post implementation of the SARS prevention strategies. On average individuals in the pre-group (n=155) waited approximately 260 minutes (SE=24) to seek medical attention vs. 203 minutes (SE=27) minutes for the post-group (n=87). However, there was nearly a six-fold increase in the percentage of cases with unknown symptom onset post implementation of COVID-19 safety precautions. There was significant delay in administering IV alteplase, increasing from 24 mins (n=16) to 33 mins (n=21) post implementation;delays observed for endovascular treatment were not significant (pre, n=13 mean= 73 mins, post n=12 mean= 82 mins). The volume of patients treated with either IV alteplase and/or endovascular treatment remained similar. Phase II of the study is on-going, results will be available for the ISC. Discussion: The COVID-19 crisis in our community was associated with a six-fold increase in the percentage of cases with unknown stroke onset time. Besides a marked decrease in stroke volume, we did not evidence significant delays to either seek or provide acute stroke care outside a modest increase in door to needle time.","Greenwood, J.; Belnap, S.; Bedgio, R.; Dabus, G.; Linfante, I.; De Los Rios La Rosa, F.",Stroke,,394

METHODS: We identified close contacts of confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in northeast Chongqing, China, who were confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-positive (RT-PCR+). We stratified this cohort by normal vs abnormal findings on chest computed tomography (CT) and compared the strata regarding comorbidities, demographics, laboratory findings, viral transmission and other factors. RESULTS: Between January 2020 and March 2020, we identified and hospitalized 279 RT-PCR+ contacts of COVID-19 patients. 63 (23%) remained asymptomatic until discharge; 29 had abnormal and 34 had normal chest CT findings. The mean cohort age was 39.3 years, and 87.3% had no comorbidities. Mean time to diagnosis after close contact with a COVID-19 index patient was 16.0 days, and it was 13.4 days and 18.7 days for those with abnormal and normal CT findings, respectively (P < .05). Nine patients (14.3%) transmitted the virus to others; 4 and 5 were in the abnormal and normal CT strata, respectively. The median length of time for nucleic acid to turn negative was 13 days compared with 10.4 days in those with normal chest CT scans (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: A portion of asymptomatic individuals were capable of transmitting the virus to others. Given the frequency and potential infectiousness of asymptomatic infections, testing of traced contacts is essential. Studies of the impact of treatment of asymptomatic RT-PCR+ individuals on disease progression and transmission should be undertaken.","Wang, Yubo; He, Yong; Tong, Jin; Qin, Yalan; Xie, Ting; Li, Jianghua; Li, Jianrong; Xiang, Jianhua; Cui, Yong; Higgs, Elizabeth S; Xiang, Jianglin",Clin Infect Dis,,394

330128,Face mask detection using YOLOv3 and faster R-CNN models: COVID-19 environment,2021,"Purpose: Owing to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, radiation oncology departments have adopted various strategies to deliver radiation therapy safely and efficiently while minimizing the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus–2 transmission among patients and health care providers. One practical strategy is to deliver stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in a single fraction, which has been well established for treating bone metastases, although it has been infrequently used for other extracranial sites. Methods and Materials: A PubMed search of published articles in English related to single-fraction SBRT was performed. A critical review was performed of the articles that described clinical outcomes of single-fraction SBRT for treatment of primary extracranial cancers and oligometastatic extraspinal disease. Results: Single-fraction SBRT for peripheral early-stage non-small cell lung cancer is supported by randomized data and is strongly endorsed during the COVID-19 pandemic by the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology-American Society for Radiation Oncology practice guidelines. Prospective and retrospective studies supporting a single-fraction regimen are limited, although outcomes are promising for renal cell carcinoma, liver metastases, and adrenal metastases. Data are immature for primary prostate cancer and demonstrate excess late toxicity in primary pancreatic cancer. Conclusions: Single-fraction SBRT should be strongly considered for peripheral early-stage non-small cell lung cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic to mitigate the potentially severe consequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus–2 transmission. Although single-fraction SBRT is promising for the definitive treatment of other primary or oligometastatic cancers, multi-fraction SBRT should be the preferred regimen owing to the need for additional prospective evaluation to determine long-term efficacy and safety.","Ng, Sylvia S.W.; Ning, Matthew S.; Lee, Percy; McMahon, Ryan A.; Siva, Shankar; Chuong, Michael D.",Adv.

METHODS: We conducted a quantitative study, which included 119 Chinese PD patients who had been treated in an outpatient neurology clinic in Wuhan and 169 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The questionnaire survey focused on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep, mental status, symptoms, and daily life and medical treatment of PD patients. RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, PD patients had significantly higher scores in both the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (8.13 vs 5.36, p < 0.001) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) -Depression (4.89 vs 3.82, p = 0.022), as well as a higher prevalence of sleep disturbances with PSQI > 5 points (68.9% vs 44.4%, p < 0.001). Sleep disturbance was identified in 68.9% of PD patients. A logistic regression analysis showed that sleep disturbance of PD patients was independently associated with exacerbation of PD symptoms (OR = 3.616, 95%CI= (1.479, 8.844), p = 0.005) and anxiety (OR = 1.379, 95%CI= (1.157, 1.642), p < 0.001).

Three of the asymptomatic cases were local individuals who spontaneously recovered before their presumed index patients developed symptoms of COVID-19. This report presents the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection that were undetected on RT-PCR tests in previous epidemiologic investigations probably due to the transient viral shedding duration.","Wu, Jinru; Liu, Xinyi; Zhou, Dan; Qiu, Guangqian; Dai, Miao; Yang, Qingting; Pan, Zhonghui; Zhou, Ning; Wu, Pa",Front.

Thermal comfort studies, either climate chamber-based or field investigation, are conducted across the globe in order to ascertain the comfort limits as per the climatic and other adaptive features. However, very few studies are conducted when the occupants are subjected to a stressed condition, like the COVID-19 lockdown, which may not only have the health impacts but also have psychological impacts on the adaptation. In this paper, we present the results of the online study conducted regarding the status of thermal comfort during the COVID-19 lockdown in India. A total of 406 complete responses were collected from subjects located across 3 different climatic regions of India, that is, cold climate, composite climate, and hot and humid climate. Variations in clothing insulation, thermal sensation, and preference were noted across the different climatic regions. We also present the variation in opening of windows and running of fans with the variation in outdoor mean air temperature. The self-judged productivity, comfort, desire to go outdoors, and effectiveness of working from home were seen to vary with the increase in the days of lockdown.","Thapa, Samar; Singh, Ramkishore; Bundele, Mahesh; Thapa, Sheetal; Thadathil, George; Kr Jakhar, Yogesh",Indoor air,,394

333952,The Case for Effective Risk Communication: Lessons from a Global Pandemic,2020,"RESEARCH QUESTION: The study set out to identify corrective measures aimed at reducing the risk of aerosol-mediated viral infection within an IVF laboratory. DESIGN: A failure modes and effect analysis (FMEA) was conducted by a multidisciplinary IVF team. A schematic representation of new protocols and procedures adopted during COVID-19 emergency has been defined, including directives about the behaviour to adopt when entering the clinic and the laboratory, in case of face-to-face contact with patients and between staff members. In addition, the risk of cross-contamination between samples belonging to different patients during cell handling and manipulation has been evaluated. Potential failure modes for each phase of the emergency have been analysed, focusing on possible sources of error. Risk priority numbers have been calculated as products of Occurrenceâ¯×â¯Severityâ¯×â¯Detection scores. RESULTS: Except for cell-cell contamination, which was considered highly unlikely, failure modes during patient-staff, staff-staff and staff-cell interactions were estimated as carrrying a moderate to high risk of infection. The main corrective measures entailed precautionary logistic measures, the implementation of additional personal protective equipment and changes in the IVF laboratory procedures and scheduling of the daily routine. Some procedures were also revised, aiming to increase staff's awareness and caution. CONCLUSIONS: Standard laboratory protocols are insufficient to face a virus whose transmission is aerosol mediated. The measures outlined in this FMEA should thus be considered not only for facing this pandemic, but also for the future to promptly manage any aerosol-mediated virus infection, whose impact on the management of an IVF laboratory might be less severe than COVID-19 although not completely negligible.","Maggiulli, Roberta; Giancani, Adriano; Fabozzi, Gemma; Dovere, Lisa; Tacconi, Luisa; Amendola, Maria Giulia; Cimadomo, Danilo; Ubaldi, Filippo Maria; Rienzi, Laura",Reprod Biomed Online,,394

We carried out this external pilot study on 38 patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 to test the effect pentoxifylline on parameters such as LDH, lymphocyte count, days of hospitalization, mortality, and proportion of patients requiring intubation. Twenty-six patients were randomized to receive 400 mg of pentoxifylline t.i.d. plus standard therapy (pentoxifylline group), while the rest received the standard treatment (control group). Linear regression models were built for statistically significant parameters. Pentoxifylline treatment was associated with a 64.25% increase (CI95% 11.83, 116.68) in lymphocyte count and a 29.61% decrease (CI95% 15.11, 44.10) in serum LDH. Although a trend towards reduced days of hospitalization, mortality, and proportion of patients requiring intubation was observed, no statistically significant difference was found for these parameters. Our findings open the possibility of pentoxifylline being repositioned as a drug for COVID-19 treatment with the advantages of a proven safety profile, availability, and no risk of immunosuppression; however, this evidence needs to be confirmed in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial.","Maldonado, Valente; Hernandez-Ramírez, Claudia; Oliva-Pérez, Eniel Alonso; Sánchez-Martínez, César Omar; Pimentel-González, Jorge Fabián; Molina-Sánchez, José Raúl; Jiménez-Villalba, Yeimmy Zuyenn; Chávez-Alderete, Jaime; Loza-Mejía, Marco A",Int Immunopharmacol,,394

The objective of this paper is to study whether the number of deaths not registered as Covid-19-related has increased compared to what would have been expected in the absence of the pandemic. Reasons behind this might include Covid-19 underreporting, avoiding visits to hospitals or GPs, and the effects of the lockdown. I used weekly ONS data on the number of deaths in England and Wales that did not officially involve Covid-19 over the period 2015-2020. Simply observing trends is not sufficient as spikes in deaths may occasionally occur. I thus followed a difference-in-differences econometric approach to study whether there was a relative increase in deaths not registered as Covid-19-related during the pandemic, compared to a control. Results suggest that there were an additional 968 weekly deaths that officially did not involve Covid-19, compared to what would have otherwise been expected. It is possible that some people are dying from Covid-19 without being diagnosed, and/or that there are excess deaths due to other causes as a result of the pandemic. Analysing the cause of death for any excess non-covid-19 deaths will shed light upon the reasons for the increase in such deaths and will help design appropriate policy responses to save lives.","Vandoros, Sotiris",Soc Sci Med,,394

METHODS: We analyzed positive COVID-19 testing results counts within New York City ZIP Code Tabulation Areas with Bayesian hierarchical Poisson spatial models using integrated nested Laplace approximations. RESULTS: Spatial clustering accounted for approximately 32% of the variation in the data. There was a nearly five-fold increase in the risk of a positive COVID-19 test (incidence density ratio = 4.8, 95% credible interval 2.4, 9.7) associated with the proportion of black/African American residents. Increases in the proportion of residents older than 65 years, housing density, and the proportion of residents with heart disease were each associated with an approximate doubling of risk. In a multivariable model including estimates for age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, housing density, and black/African American race, the only variables that remained associated with positive COVID-19 testing with a probability greater than chance were the proportion of black/African American residents and proportion of older persons.

Detecting the presence of an infectious virus in the collected sample is essential to analyze if a person can transmit infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, there have been no quantitative investigations conducted for infectious SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. Therefore, in the present study, a rapid and simple focus-forming assay using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique was developed to quantify infectious SARS-CoV-2 titers in 119 samples (n = 52, nasopharyngeal swabs [NPS]; n = 67, saliva) from patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, the study findings were compared with the cycle threshold (Ct) values of real-time RT-PCR. The infectious virus titers in NPS samples and Ct values were inversely correlated, and no infectious virus could be detected when the Ct value exceeded 30. In contrast, a low correlation was observed between the infectious virus titers in saliva and Ct values (r = -0.261, p = 0.027). Furthermore, the infectious virus titers in the saliva were significantly lower than those in the NPS samples. Ten days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms, the infectious virus was undetectable, and Ct values were more than 30 in NSP and saliva samples. The results indicate that patients whose symptoms subsided 10 days after onset, with Ct values more than 30 in NSP and saliva samples, were less likely to infect others.","Hiroi, Satoshi; Kubota-Koketsu, Ritsuko; Sasaki, Tadahiro; Morikawa, Saeko; Motomura, Kazushi; Nakayama, Emi E; Okuno, Yoshinobu; Shioda, Tatsuo",J Med Virol,,394

Furthermore, pertinent to the COVID pandemic, increase use of telehealth will reduces risks of exposing providers and patients to the virus. Adoption rate limited to medical emergencies is insufficient. The World Health Organization (WHO) had issued advisement regarding the risks of infection especially in crowded hospitals and emergency rooms. Failures to adequately warn hospitals and health providers have resulted in q ""multiplier effect"" of exponential growth in infections, something which could have otherwise been avoided by safely treating patients 'remotely', from their homes.

To fulfill the goal of providing adequate management of such women and their infants, and to decrease the risk of exposure of the healthcare providers, tentative guidelines are needed until more evidence is collected. Practical preventative action is required that takes into account the following infection routes: (i) aerosol transmission from mothers to healthcare providers, (ii) horizontal transmission to healthcare providers from infants infected by their mothers, and (iii) horizontal transmission from mothers to infants. To develop standard operating procedures, briefings/training simulations should be carried out, taking into account the latest information. Briefings should be carefully conducted to clarify the role and procedures. Healthcare providers should wear personal protective equipment. If it is physically possible, neonatal resuscitation should be performed in a separate area next to the delivery room. If a separate area is not available, the infant warmer should be placed at least 2 m away from the delivery table, or partitioned off in the same room.

The purpose of this study was to assess whether the stress related to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic affected disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease. BASIC METHODS: An anonymous survey was distributed to patients through gastroenterology clinics and networks. Patients were asked to report their Crohn's disease symptoms in the months prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and again during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic using the Manitoba inflammatory bowel disease index in addition to questions about stress, perception of reasons for symptom change and personal impact. MAIN RESULTS: Out of 243 individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of Crohn's disease, there was a 24% relative increase in active symptoms between the pre-COVID-19 period to the during-COVID-19 period (P < 0.0001) reflecting an absolute change from 45 to 56%, respectively. The most frequent reported reason for a change in symptoms was 'Increased stress/and or feeling overwhelmed' (118/236), and personal impact of the pandemic was, 'I'm worrying a lot about the future' (113/236), both reported by approximately half of respondents. PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS: This study serves as a 'proof of concept' demonstrating the impact of a significant and uniquely uniform stressor as a natural experiment on Crohn's disease activity. The severity of symptoms of Crohn's disease increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary reported reason for symptom change was an increase in stress, not a change in diet, exercise or other lifestyle behaviours, corroborating the hypothesis that stress affects Crohn's disease activity.","Goodday, Sarah M; Travis, Simon; Walsh, Alissa; Friend, Stephen H",Eur. j. gastroenterol. hepatol,,394

346979,Coronavirus and the resulting crisis: about the prospects of the world economy and energy,2020,"Firearm sales have surged during COVID-19, raising concerns about a coming wave of suicide deaths. Little is known, however, about the individuals considering acquiring firearms during the pandemic. Recent research has highlighted that individuals considering acquiring firearms may be motivated by exaggerated threat expectancies. In a sample of 3,500 Americans matched to 2010 United States Census data, we compared individuals intending to buy firearms in the coming 12 months (assessed in late June and early July 2020) to those undecided or not planning to acquire firearms on a range of demographic, anxiety, and firearm ownership variables. Our results indicated that those intending to acquire a firearm in the next twelve months are less tolerant of uncertainty, endorse exaggerated threat expectancies, and are experiencing more severe COVID-19 specific fears. Individuals intending to purchase firearms were also more likely to have experienced suicidal ideation in the past year, to have worked in law enforcement, and to have been considered essential workers during COVID-19. Furthermore, such individuals were more likely to already own firearms and to have purchased firearms during the opening months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Those intending to purchase firearms did not endorse lower perceived neighborhood safety, however, indicating that their intent to purchase firearms is unlikely to be driven by tangible threats in their immediate environment. These findings highlight that exaggerated fears may be motivating individuals to purchase firearms to diminish anxiety and that this trend may be particularly common among individuals who already own firearms.","Anestis, Michael D; Bryan, Craig J",J Psychiatr Res,,394

351610,What Did You Do during the Pandemic?: Facing Extraordinary Challenges [Career Advisor],2021,"MOTIVATION: Ligand-receptor (L-R) interactions mediate cell adhesion, recognition and communication and play essential roles in physiological and pathological signaling. With the rapid development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies, systematically decoding the intercellular communication network involving L-R interactions has become a focus of research. Therefore, construction of a comprehensive, high-confidence and well-organized resource to retrieve L-R interactions in order to study the functional effects of cell-cell communications would be of great value. RESULTS: In this study, we developed Cellinker, a manually curated resource of literature-supported L-R interactions that play roles in cell-cell communication. We aimed to provide a useful platform for studies on cell-cell communication mediated by L-R interactions. The current version of Cellinker documents over 3,700 human and 3,200 mouse L-R protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and embeds a practical and convenient webserver with which researchers can decode intercellular communications based on scRNA-seq data. And over 400 endogenous small molecule (sMOL) related L-R interactions were collected as well. Moreover, to help with research on coronavirus (CoV) infection, Cellinker collects information on 16 L-R PPIs involved in CoV-human interactions (including 12 L-R PPIs involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection). In summary, Cellinker provides a user-friendly interface for querying, browsing and visualizing L-R interactions as well as a practical and convenient web tool for inferring intercellular communications based on scRNA-seq data. We believe this platform could promote intercellular communication research and accelerate the development of related algorithms for scRNA-seq studies. AVAILABILITY: Cellinker is available at http://www.rna-society.org/cellinker/.

However, little attention has been given to the mental health of a group considered an essential category, police officers and the members of the armed forces. This study examined the mental health of 204 members of the armed forces and the police department assigned to monitor the public roads to enforce the measures adopted by the Peruvian government. The instruments used in the study included the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), and the Revised Mental Health Inventory-5. The results indicate that (during the last month), the majority of the participants felt nervous and edgy (81.8%), and hopeless or sad (68.2%). According to the participants, the feelings of hopelessness and discouragement were significantly affecting their ability to rebound (84.3%). Participants had mixed feelings in regards of the fear generated by COVID-19, 42.6% reported extreme anxiety or panic, 40.6% were uncomfortable to think about COVID-19, and 42.6% were afraid of losing their lives due to the illness. The fear of COVID-19 predicted 19.7% (Adjusted R2 = 0.197;F = 21.32;p = .000) of the participants' mental health well-being. In summary, the results suggest the presence of important psychological stressors related to COVID-19 that could potentially led to the development of mental health disorders among the Peruvian police and armed forces.","Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás Barboza-Palomino Miguel Carbajal-León Carlos Heredia-Mongrut José Gallegos Miguel Vilca Lindsey W.; de Castro Pecanha, Viviane",Electronic Journal of General Medicine,,394

Although repurposed drugs with favorable safety profiles could have significant benefit, widely available prevention or treatment options for COVID-19 have yet to be identified. Efforts to identify approved drugs with in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 resulted in identification of antiviral sigma-1 receptor ligands, including antihistamines in the histamine-1 receptor binding class. We identified antihistamine candidates for repurposing by mining electronic health records of usage in population of more than 219,000 subjects tested for SARS-CoV-2. Usage of diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine and azelastine was associated with reduced incidence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in subjects greater than age 61. We found diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine and azelastine to exhibit direct antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Although mechanisms by which specific antihistamines exert antiviral effects is not clear, hydroxyzine, and possibly azelastine, bind Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) and the sigma-1 receptor as off-targets. Clinical studies are needed to measure the effectiveness of diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine and azelastine for disease prevention, for early intervention, or as adjuvant therapy for severe COVID-19.","Reznikov, Leah R; Norris, Michael H; Vashisht, Rohit; Bluhm, Andrew P; Li, Danmeng; Liao, Yan-Shin J; Brown, Ashley; Butte, Atul J; Ostrov, David A",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,,394

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between prior metabolic surgery and the severity of COVID-19 in patients with severe obesity. SETTING: Cleveland Clinic Health System in the United States. METHODS: Among 4365 patients who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) between March 8, 2020 and July 22, 2020 in the Cleveland Clinic Health System, 33 patients were identified who had a prior history of metabolic surgery. The surgical patients were propensity matched 1:10 to nonsurgical patients to assemble a cohort of control patients (n = 330) with a body mass index (BMI) &#8805; 40 kg/m2 at the time of SARS-CoV-2 testing. The primary endpoint was the rate of hospital admission. The exploratory endpoints included admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), need for mechanical ventilation and dialysis during index hospitalization, and mortality. After propensity score matching, outcomes were compared in univariate and multivariate regression models. RESULTS: The average BMI of the surgical group was 49.1 ± 8.8 kg/m2 before metabolic surgery and was down to 37.2 ± 7.1 at the time of SARS-CoV-2 testing, compared with the control group's BMI of 46.7 ± 6.4 kg/m2. In the univariate analysis, 6 (18.2%) patients in the metabolic surgery group and 139 (42.1%) patients in the control group were admitted to the hospital (P = .013). In the multivariate analysis, a prior history of metabolic surgery was associated with a lower hospital admission rate compared with control patients with obesity (odds ratio, 0.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.88; P = .028). While none of the 4 exploratory outcomes occurred in the metabolic surgery group, 43 (13.0%) patients in the control group required ICU admission (P = .021), 22 (6.7%) required mechanical ventilation, 5 (1.5%) required dialysis, and 8 (2.4%) patients died. CONCLUSION: Prior metabolic surgery with subsequent weight loss and improvement of metabolic abnormalities was associated with lower rates of hospital and ICU admission in patients with obesity who became infected with SARS-CoV-2. Confirmation of these findings will require larger studies.","Aminian, Ali; Fathalizadeh, Alisan; Tu, Chao; Butsch, W Scott; Pantalone, Kevin M; Griebeler, Marcio L; Kashyap, Sangeeta R; Rosenthal, Raul J; Burguera, Bartolome; Nissen, Steven E",Surg. obes. relat. dis,,394

Originating in bats, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is transmitted to humans through unknown intermediate hosts, where it is primarily known to cause pneumonia-like complications in the respiratory system. Organ-to-organ transmission has not been ruled out, thereby raising the possibility of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on multiple organ systems. The male reproductive system has been hypothesized to be a potential target of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is supported by some preliminary evidence. This may pose a global threat to male fertility potential, as men are more prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection than women, especially those of reproductive age. Preliminary reports have also indicated the possibility of sexual transmission of SARS-CoV-2. It may cause severe complications in infected couples. This review focuses on the pathophysiology of potential SARS-CoV-2 infection in the reproductive organs of males along with their invasion mechanisms. The risks of COVID-19 on male fertility as well as the differences in vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with females have also been highlighted.","Roychoudhury, Shubhadeep; Das, Anandan; Jha, Niraj Kumar; Kesari, Kavindra Kumar; Roychoudhury, Shatabhisha; Jha, Saurabh Kumar; Kosgi, Raghavender; Choudhury, Arun Paul; Lukac, Norbert; Madhu, Nithar Ranjan; Kumar, Dhruv; Slama, Petr",Open Biol,,394
357312,Valuation of Energy Security for Natural Gas—European Example,2021,"Background and purpose: Heart disease has been one of the most important causes of death in the last 10 years, so the use of classification methods to diagnose and predict heart disease is very important. If this disease is predicted before menstruation, it is possible to prevent high mortality of the disease and provide more accurate and efficient treatment methods. Materials and Methods: Due to the selection of input features, the use of basic algorithms can be very time-consuming. Reducing dimensions or choosing a good subset of features, without risking accuracy, has great importance for basic algorithms for successful use in the region. In this paper, we propose an ensemble-genetic learning method using wrapper feature reduction to select features in disease classification. Findings: The development of a medical diagnosis system based on ensemble learning to predict heart disease provides a more accurate diagnosis than the traditional method and reduces the cost of treatment. Conclusion: The results showed that Thallium Scan and vascular occlusion were the most important features in the diagnosis of heart disease and can distinguish between sick and healthy people with 97.57% accuracy.","Abdollahi, Jafar; Nouri-Moghaddam, Babak",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08175v1.pdf,394

OBJECTIVE: To determine the adjusted effect of body mass index (BMI), associated comorbidities, time, neighborhood-level sociodemographic factors, and other factors on risk for death due to COVID-19. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Kaiser Permanente Southern California, a large integrated health care organization. PATIENTS: Kaiser Permanente Southern California members diagnosed with COVID-19 from 13 February to 2 May 2020. MEASUREMENTS: Multivariable Poisson regression estimated the adjusted effect of BMI and other factors on risk for death at 21 days; models were also stratified by age and sex. RESULTS: Among 6916 patients with COVID-19, there was a J-shaped association between BMI and risk for death, even after adjustment for obesity-related comorbidities. Compared with patients with a BMI of 18.5 to 24 kg/m2, those with BMIs of 40 to 44 kg/m2 and greater than 45 kg/m2 had relative risks of 2.68 (95% CI, 1.43 to 5.04) and 4.18 (CI, 2.12 to 8.26), respectively. This risk was most striking among those aged 60 years or younger and men. Increased risk for death associated with Black or Latino race/ethnicity or other sociodemographic characteristics was not detected. LIMITATION: Deaths occurring outside a health care setting and not captured in membership files may have been missed. CONCLUSION: Obesity plays a profound role in risk for death from COVID-19, particularly in male patients and younger populations. Our capitated system with more equalized health care access may explain the absence of effect of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities on death. Our data highlight the leading role of severe obesity over correlated risk factors, providing a target for early intervention.

While identification and containment of new cases remain important, laboratories must now pivot and consider an assessment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunity in the setting of the recent availability of multiple COVID-19 vaccines. Here, we have utilized the latest Abbott Alinity semiquantitative IgM and quantitative IgG spike protein (SP) serology assays (IgMSP and IgGSP) in combination with Abbott Alinity IgG nucleocapsid (NC) antibody test (IgGNC) to assess antibody responses in a cohort of 1,236 unique participants comprised of naive, SARS-CoV-2-infected, and vaccinated (including both naive and recovered) individuals. The IgMSP and IgGSP assays were highly specific (100%) with no cross-reactivity to archived samples collected prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, including those from individuals with seasonal coronavirus infections. Clinical sensitivity was 96% after 15 days for both IgMSP and IgGSP assays individually. When considered together, the sensitivity was 100%. A combination of NC- and SP-specific serologic assays clearly differentiated naive, SARS-CoV-2-infected, and vaccine-related immune responses. Vaccination resulted in a significant increase in IgGSP and IgMSP values, with a major rise in IgGSP following the booster (second) dose in the naive group. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2-recovered individuals had several-fold higher IgGSP responses than naive following the primary dose, with a comparatively dampened response following the booster. This work illustrates the strong clinical performance of these new serological assays and their utility in evaluating and distinguishing serological responses to infection and vaccination.","Narasimhan, Madhusudhanan; Mahimainathan, Lenin; Araj, Ellen; Clark, Andrew E; Markantonis, John; Green, Allen; Xu, Jing; SoRelle, Jeffrey A; Alexis, Charles; Fankhauser, Kimberly; Parikh, Hiren; Wilkinson, Kathleen; Reczek, Annika; Kopplin, Noa; Yekkaluri, Sruthi; Balani, Jyoti; Thomas, Abey; Singal, Amit G; Sarode, Ravi; Muthukumar, Alagarraju",J Clin Microbiol,,394

However, it is likely to be very difficult to ensure that adolescents keep apart from one another since peer interactions are extremely significant for them. Aims: We examined the utility of the Theory of Planned Behavior enhanced with a construct of the Protection Motivation Theory for predicting physical distancing behavior among adolescents during the period following the national lockdown imposed in Italy to tackle the pandemic. Method: Measures of attitude, subjective norm, perceptions of behavioral control, perceptions of threat regarding personal health and the health of loved ones, and intention were administered to the participants (N = 363) at baseline. Measures of physical distancing behavior were then administered 3 weeks later (N = 350). Results: The tested structural equation model accounted for 77% of variance in intention and 25% of variance in behavior. Perceived behavioral control and attitude were important predictors of intention and behavior, while the data did not support the hypothesized impact of perceptions of threat. Limitation: Due to the observational nature of the data caution should be taken in drawing causal inferences. Conclusion: The results suggest that programs for increasing physical distancing behavior in adolescents by concentrating exclusively on risks to their health or that of their loved ones might prove to be ineffective. Instead, it seems likely that prevention campaigns targeting adolescents will be more successful if they focus on perceived behavioral control and attitude. © 2021 Hogrefe Publishing.","Cavicchiolo, E.; Manganelli, S.; Girelli, L.; Cozzolino, M.; Lucidi, F.; Alivernini, F.",European Journal of Health Psychology,,394

363357,Blockchain-Based Forward Supply Chain and Waste Management for COVID-19 Medical Equipment and Supplies,2021,"Historically speaking, the behavioral tradition advanced functional analysis as a method of applying existing principles to novel situations. In the more than half a century since that idea was advanced, functional analysis has either fallen into disuse, as in most of applied psychology, or has been used but modified to a point that is virtually inapplicable elsewhere, as in applied behavior analysis work with severe developmental disabilities. In this paper we argue that the current challenges with COVID-19 present an ideal time to reinvigorate functional analysis by combining it with the growing body of evidence on processes of change, organized under an extended evolutionary meta-model. This new form of process-based functional analysis takes advantage of the strengths of contextual behavioral science, while opening avenues of fruitful interaction with other wings of intervention and evolutionary science more generally. Using the psychological flexibility model as an example, we show how this approach solves the key problems of classical functional analysis and helps professionals deal with novel challenges such as those posed by COVID-19. Humanity is now facing an extraordinary and unexpected situation. Behavioral science needs to rise to that challenge in a way that provides both immediate practical value and greater assurance of long-term benefits for our understanding of human complexity more generally. Process-based functional analysis can be a vehicle to do just that.","Hayes, Steven C; Hofmann, Stefan G; Stanton, Cory E",J Contextual Behav Sci,,394

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the reactive lymphocytes (RE-LYMP) parameter in COVID-19 and to correlate it with activation lymphocytes markers by flow cytometry. The study group consisted of 40 patients: with COVID-19 infection (n = 20) and with others virus infections without COVID-19 (COVID-19(-) virus (n = 20)) and 20 healthy donors (HC). Blood count and flow cytometry were performed. The COVID-19(+) group had significantly lower RE-LYMP parameter than the COVID-19(-) virus group (5.45 vs. 11.05, p < 0.05). We observed higher proportion of plasmablasts in the COVID-19(+) and COVID-19(-) virus groups than HC (8.8 vs. 11.1 vs. 2.7, p < 0.05). In the COVID-19(+) there was a lower proportion of CD4+ CD38+ cells than in the other groups (significant differences between COVID-19(+) and COVID-19(-) virus groups). RE-LYMP correlated with activated T lymphocytes CD38+ and HLA-DR+ in the COVID-19(-) virus group, however in the COVID-19(+) group correlations with T lymphocytes CD25+ and CD45RO+ were observed. In summary the analysis of the RE-LYMP together with flow cytometric activation markers can be helpful in identifying and distinguishing patients with COVID-19(+) from other viruses and HC.","Rutkowska, Elzbieta; Kwiecien, Iwona; Kulik, Katarzyna; Chelstowska, Beata; Klos, Krzysztof; Rzepecki, Piotr; Chcialowski, Andrzej",,,394
364433,Artificial Intelligence (AI) Provided Early Detection of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) in China and Will Influence Future Urban Health Policy Internationally,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Treatment with medications for opioid use disorder such as buprenorphine improves patient morbidity and mortality as well as treatment adherence, an important component of patient care. Buprenorphine is combined with naloxone to reduce misuse; and, when taken sublingually, naloxone is poorly absorbed. Urine testing for buprenorphine is a common way to monitor adherence. Some patients who want to appear adherent may directly tamper with their urine by adding buprenorphine to their urine to allow for the detection without ingestion. Practitioners may rely upon the concentration of buprenorphine and the metabolite, norbuprenorphine, and utilize the ratio of metabolite to parent compound (norbuprenorphine:buprenorphine - N:B ratio) to discern possible evidence of tampering; however, there remains debate as to what specific ratio may signify this practice. Testing for naloxone may also help determine if urine tampering occurred as only low naloxone concentrations are found in the urine when taken by a sublingual route. METHODS: To determine a reliable N:B ratio that may be used to identify possible urine tampering by adding parent drug directly to urine, we examined 136,605 urine samples for quantitative concentrations of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine by LC-MS/MS performed at a commercial laboratory. After identifying abnormal ratios (<0.02), we then compared them with naloxone concentrations and specimen validity testing, other markers that may coincide with specimen tampering of this type. RESULTS: Correlating urinary buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine concentrations, we found 2 distinct patient populations, which could be distinguished by N:B ratios ranging from 0.01 to 0.2. In addition, while the distribution of urine naloxone concentrations itself did not demonstrate distinct populations, naloxone was able to further flag potential tampered specimens when combined with N:B ratios. Abnormal specimen validity testing was additionally found more commonly in cases with N:B ratios <0.02. CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive study compared N:B ratios with naloxone concentrations and specimen validity testing. This study suggests that a N:B ratio of <0.02 in concert with high naloxone concentrations (>1000 ng/ml) can help to identify potential cases of tampered urine samples.","Warrington, Jill S; Warrington, Gregory S; Francis-Fath, Samuel; Brooklyn, John",,,394

The significance of this finding is unclear and, in most patients, does not represent active infection. Detection of subgenomic RNA has been proposed to represent productive infection and may be a useful marker for monitoring infectivity. METHODS: We used RT-qPCR to quantify total and subgenomic nucleocapsid (sgN) and envelope (sgE) transcripts in 185 SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal swab samples collected on hospital admission and to relate to symptom duration. RESULTS: We find that all transcripts decline at the same rate; however, sgE becomes undetectable before other transcripts. The median duration of symptoms to a negative test is 14 days for sgE and 25 days for sgN. There is a linear decline in subgenomic compared to total RNA suggesting subgenomic transcript copy number is dependent on copy number of total transcripts. The mean difference between total and sgN is 16-fold and the mean difference between total and sgE is 137-fold. This relationship is constant over duration of symptoms allowing prediction of subgenomic copy number from total copy number. CONCLUSIONS: Subgenomic RNA may be no more useful in determining infectivity than a copy number threshold determined for total RNA.","Dimcheff, Derek E; Valesano, Andrew L; Rumfelt, Kalee E; Fitzsimmons, William J; Blair, Christopher; Mirabelli, Carmen; Petrie, Joshua G; Martin, Emily T; Bhambhani, Chandan; Tewari, Muneesh; Lauring, Adam S",J. infect. dis,,394

Acute respiratory complications that require intensive care unit (ICU) management are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Patients with worst outcomes and higher mortality are reported to include immunocompromised subjects, namely older adults and polymorbid individuals and malnourished people in general. ICU stay, polymorbidity and older age are all commonly associated with high risk for malnutrition, representing per se a relevant risk factor for higher morbidity and mortality in chronic and acute disease. Also importantly, prolonged ICU stays are reported to be required for COVID-19 patients stabilization, and longer ICU stay may per se directly worsen or cause malnutrition, with severe loss of skeletal muscle mass and function which may lead to disability, poor quality of life and additional morbidity. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of malnutrition should therefore be routinely included in the management of COVID-19 patients. In the current document, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) aims at providing concise guidance for nutritional management of COVID-19 patients by proposing 10 practical recommendations. The practical guidance is focused to those in the ICU setting or in the presence of older age and polymorbidity, which are independently associated with malnutrition and its negative impact on patient survival.","Barazzoni, Rocco; Bischoff, Stephan C; Breda, Joao; Wickramasinghe, Kremlin; Krznaric, Zeljko; Nitzan, Dorit; Pirlich, Matthias; Singer, Pierre",Clin Nutr,,394
365370,Arguments as social good: Good arguments in times of crisis,2020,"BACKGROUND: In 2020, a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, quickly spread worldwide within a few months. Although coronaviruses typically infect the upper or lower respiratory tract, the virus RNA can be detected in plasma. The risk of transmitting coronavirus via transfusion of blood products remains. As more asymptomatic infections are identified in COVID-19 cases, blood safety has become particularly important. Methylene blue (MB) photochemical technology has been proven to inactivate lipid-enveloped viruses with high efficiency and safety. The present study aimed to investigate the SARS-CoV-2 inactivation effects of MB in plasma. METHODS: The SARS-CoV-2 virus strain was isolated from Zhejiang University. The live virus was harvested from cultured VERO-E6 cells, and mixed with MB in plasma. The MB final concentrations were 0, 1, 2, and 4 µM. The ""BX-1 AIDS treatment instrument"" was used at room temperature, the illumination adjusted to 55,000 ± 0.5 million Lux, and the plasma was irradiated for 0, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mins using light at a single wavelength of 630 nm. Virus load changes were measured using quantitative reverse transcription- PCR. RESULTS: BX-1 could effectively eliminate SARS-CoV-2 within 2 mins in plasma, and the virus titer declined to 4.5 log10 TCID50 (median tissue culture infectious dose)/mL. CONCLUSION: BX-1 is based on MB photochemical technology, which was designed to inactivate HIV-1 virus in plasma. It was proven to be safe and reliable in clinical trials of HIV treatment. In this study, we showed that BX-1 could also be applied to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. During the current outbreak, this technique it has great potential for ensuring the safety of blood transfusions, for plasma transfusion therapy in recovering patients, and for preparing inactivated vaccines.","Jin, Changzhong; Yu, Bin; Zhang, Jie; Wu, Hao; Zhou, Xipeng; Yao, Hangping; Liu, Fumin; Lu, Xiangyun; Cheng, Linfang; Jiang, Miao; Wu, Nanping",BMC Infect Dis,,394

In this paper, hybrid mathematical models of new strains and co-infection in Caputo, Caputo-Fabrizio, and Atangana-Baleanu are presented. The idea behind this co-infection modeling is that, as per medical reports, both dengue and covid-19 have similar symptoms at the early stages. Our aim is to evaluate and predict the transmission dynamics of both deadly viruses. The qualitative study via stability analysis is discussed at equilibria and reproduction number R 0 is computed. For the numerical purpose, Adams-Bashforth-Moulton and Newton methods are employed to obtain the approximate solutions of the proposed model.

For this reason, it is necessary to explore new approaches for the development of a drug capable of inhibiting the entry of the virus into the host cell. Therefore, this work includes the exploration of potential inhibitory compounds for the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID: 6VSB), which were obtained from The Patogen Box. Later, they were filtered through virtual screening and molecular docking techniques, thus obtaining a top of 1000 compounds, which were used against a binding site located in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and a cryptic site located in the N-Terminal Domain (NTD), resulting in good pharmaceutical targets for the blocking the infection. From the top 1000, the best compound (TCMDC-124223) was selected for the binding site. It interacts with specific residues that intervene in the recognition and subsequent entry into the host cell, resulting in a more favorable binding free energy in comparison to the control compounds (Hesperidine and Emodine).

History and Philosophical Teachings,2020-07-25,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) which has posed a significant threat to global health. Although the infection is frequently asymptomatic or associated with mild symptoms, in a small proportion of patients it can produce an intense inflammatory and prothrombotic state that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure, and death. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), highly expressed in the respiratory system, has been identified as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Notably, ACE2 is also expressed in the cardiovascular system and there are multiple cardiovascular implications of COVID-19. Cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular disease have been associated with severe manifestations and poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Importantly, patients with COVID-19 may have thrombotic and coagulation abnormalities promoting a hypercoagulable state, resulting in an increased rate of thrombotic and thromboembolic events. This review will describe the pathophysiology of the cardiovascular involvement following infection by SARS-CoV-2, with a focus on thrombotic and thromboembolic manifestations and implications for antithrombotic management.","Ortega-Paz, Luis; Capodanno, Davide; Montalescot, Gilles; Angiolillo, Dominick J",J Am Heart Assoc,,394

A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the epidemiological and clinical aspects of COVID-19 in patients younger than 20 years in Pernambuco (Brazil), with cases confirmed by reverse-transcriptase-PCR SARS-CoV-2 between 13 February and June 19, 2020, reported on information systems. Data regarding age (< 30 days, 1-11 months, 1-4 years, 5-9 years, 10-14 years, and 15-19 years), gender, color/race, symptoms, pregnancy or puerperium, comorbidities, hospitalization, and death were investigated. Fatality rate and mortality coefficient were calculated, and a multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to determine if gender, age, and comorbidities were factors associated with death. Of 682 pediatric cases, 52.8% were female, with a mean age of 9 ± 7.2 years. The most frequent symptoms were fever (64.4%), cough (52.4%), and respiratory distress (32.4%). Hospitalization was reported in 46.2% of cases, mainly among neonates (80.3%) and infants (73.8%). Thirty-eight deaths were notified, and a fatality rate of 5.6% (95% CI: 3.9-7.3) was found, with higher fatality rates among neonates 11.5% (7 of 61) and 9.5% (8 of 84) infants. The mortality coefficient was 10.9 per 100,000 inhabitants < 1 year of age, whereas comorbidities (Odds ratio [OR] = 14.13, 95% CI: 6.35-31.44), age < 30 days (OR = 5.17, 95% CI: 1.81-14.77), and age 1-11 months (OR = 3.28, 95% CI: 1.21-8.91) were independent factors associated with death.

A key challenge is to develop a technology that captures pathogens for identification from ambient air. While pathogenic species vary significantly in size and shape, for effective airborne pathogen detection the target species must be selectively captured from aerosolized droplets. Captured pathogens must then be separated from the remaining aerosolized droplet content and characterized in real-time. While improvements have been made with clinical laboratory automated sorting in culture media based on morphological characteristics of cells, this application has not extended to aerosol samples containing bacteria, viruses, spores, or prions. This manuscript presents a strategy and a model for the development of an airborne pandemic early warning system using aerosol sampling.","Bango, J. J.; Agostinelli, S.

368313,Extending the measurement of quality beyond service delivery indicators,2020,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 remains pandemic with countries scrambling to mass vaccinate populations, prioritising health-care workers, the elderly and the vulnerable. Malta is a small Mediterranean country with a population of circa half a million with free healthcare at point-of-care. This paper reviews the adaptations made to cope with mass vaccination. METHODS: Permission was obtained to tour hospital facilities. Photographs were taken with and edited on a mobile phone, a previously utilised methodology. RESULTS: Vaccination commenced on 27/12/20 with priorities as above. Malta Medical School lecture halls were initially used, followed by outpatients at the country's regional hospital, as well as other lecture halls, and National Health Service clinics. Virtually all medically vulnerable individuals have had their first doses as well as most individuals &#8805;60 years of age, with the 55-60 year age group currently targeted. Malta is well ahead of the European Union average. DISCUSSION: Exacting logistics and cooperation by all local authorities (such as the University of Malta) has resulted in a highly successful vaccine rollout. The eventual licencing of vaccination for children and the availability of booster dose/s will further facilitate the eventual attainment of herd immunity. This must be a global effort lest escape variants render these efforts futile.","Grech, Victor; Souness, Jorgen; Agius, Steve",J Vis Commun Med,,394

368833,Mathematical model building for COVID-19 diseases data in european countries,2020,"BACKGROUND: The effects of ABO incompatibility on cord blood transplantation (CBT) have not been confirmed. We retrospectively investigated the effect of ABO incompatibility on the clinical outcomes and changes of isoagglutinin titres of 261 consecutive patients who underwent CBT in a single centre. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied patients with haematological malignancies undergoing unrelated CBT following myeloablative conditioning. There were 80 matched, 72 major mismatched, 72 minor mismatched, and 37 bidirectional mismatched transplants. Risk factors that could potentially influence the patients' outcomes were evaluated. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) isohaemagglutinin antibody (IHA) titres were determined 1 day before and 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after the transplant. RESULTS: ABO mismatches did not influence engraftment, transfusion requirements, event-free survival or overall survival following CBT. The anti-donor IgM serum IHA titres fell to &#8804;1:8 at week 8 after CBT in all patients with ABO major and bidirectional mismatches. The percentages of patients requiring platelet and red blood cell transfusions in the period 31-61 days after CBT were markedly lower than in the period 0-30 days after CBT, being 15% vs 99% for platelets and 23% vs 78% for red blood cells, respectively. Of the 69 recipients of minor mismatched CBT tested, only three with AB blood type developed low titres of anti-recipient IHA after 5 months. DISCUSSION: In this study ABO incompatibility did not affect clinical outcomes after CBT. A higher number of CD34+ cells infused was correlated with earlier engraftment. Severe acute graft-versus-host disease was associated with poor overall survival. As the IHA titre decreased, so did the number of patients requiring blood transfusion. Rapidly decreasing anti-donor IHA titres and the non-production of donor anti-recipient A and/or B antibodies might contribute to a good outcome of ABO-incompatible CBT with myeloablative conditioning for haematological malignancies.","Chen, Yang; Wan, Xiaoju; Cao, Yuan; Wang, Huiru; Han, Dandan; Zhang, Yuangyuang; Yao, Wen; Song, Kaidi; Fan, Qian; Zhu, Xiaoyu; Sun, Ziming; Liu, Huilan","Blood transfus.

Using the data from 47 individuals, feedback and dialogue generation were automated using the hidden Markov model and a schema-driven dialogue manager capable of handling multi-topic conversations. We conducted a study with nine high-functioning ASD teenagers, and through thematic analysis of post-experiment interviews, identified several key design considerations, notably: 1) Users should be fully briefed at the outset about the purpose and limitations of the system, to avoid unrealistic expectations. 2) An interface should incorporate positive acknowledgment of behavior change. 3) Realistic appearance of a virtual agent and responsiveness are important in engaging users. 4) Conversation personalization, for instance in prompting laconic users for more input and reciprocal questions, would help the teenagers engage for longer terms and increase the system's utility.","Ali, Mohammad Rafayet; Razavi, Zahra; Mamun, Abdullah Al; Langevin, Raina; Rawassizadeh, Reza; Schubert, Lenhart; Hoque, M Ehsan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.03046v2.pdf,394
371264,Time for an about-face on face mask defiance,2020,"Given the scale and rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, or 2019-nCoV), there is an urgent need to identify therapeutics that are effective against COVID-19 before vaccines are available. Since the current rate of SARS-CoV-2 knowledge acquisition via traditional research methods is not sufficient to match the rapid spread of the virus, novel strategies of drug discovery for SARS-CoV-2 infection are required. Structure-based virtual screening for example relies primarily on docking scores and does not take the importance of key residues into consideration, which may lead to a significantly higher incidence rate of false-positive results. Our novel in silico approach, which overcomes these limitations, can be utilized to quickly evaluate FDA-approved drugs for repurposing and combination, as well as designing new chemical agents with therapeutic potential for COVID-19. As a result, anti-HIV or antiviral drugs (lopinavir, tenofovir disoproxil, fosamprenavir and ganciclovir), antiflu drugs (peramivir and zanamivir) and an anti-HCV drug (sofosbuvir) are predicted to bind to 3CLPro in SARS-CoV-2 with therapeutic potential for COVID-19 infection by our new protocol. In addition, we also propose three antidiabetic drugs (acarbose, glyburide and tolazamide) for the potential treatment of COVID-19. Finally, we apply our new virus chemogenomics knowledgebase platform with the integrated machine-learning computing algorithms to identify the potential drug combinations (e.g. remdesivir+chloroquine), which are congruent with ongoing clinical trials. In addition, another 10 compounds from CAS COVID-19 antiviral candidate compounds dataset are also suggested by Molecular Complex Characterizing System with potential treatment for COVID-19. Our work provides a novel strategy for the repurposing and combinations of drugs in the market and for prediction of chemical candidates with anti-COVID-19 potential.","Feng, Zhiwei; Chen, Maozi; Xue, Ying; Liang, Tianjian; Chen, Hui; Zhou, Yuehan; Nolin, Thomas D; Smith, Randall B; Xie, Xiang-Qun",Brief. bioinform,,394

Materials and Methods: A proficiency-based progression stepwise curriculum was developed consisting of didactic, technical and non-technical components using a virtual reality simulator (VRS). It focused on: scope navigation, anatomical landmarks identification, mucosal inspection, retro-flexion, pathology identification, and targeting biopsy. A total of 5 experienced and 10 novice endoscopists were recruited. All participants performed each of the selected modules twice, and mean and median performance were compared between the two groups. Novices pre-set level of proficiency was set as 2 standard deviations below the mean of experts. Performance was assessed using multiple-choice questions for knowledge, while validated simulator parameters incorporated into a novel checklist; Simulation Endoscopic Skill Assessment Score (SESAS) were used for technical skills. Results: : The following VRS outcome measures have shown expert vs novice baseline discriminative ability: total procedure time, number of attempts for esophageal intubation and time in red-out. All novice trainees achieved the preset level of proficiency by the end of training. There were no statistically significant differences between experts' and trainees' rate of complications, landmarks identification and patient discomfort. SESAS checklist showed high degree of agreement with the VRS metrices (kappa = 0.83) and the previously validated direct observation of procedural skills tool (kappa = 0.90). Conclusion: : The Fundamentals of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy simulation training curriculum and its SESAS global assessment tool have been primarily validated and can serve as a valuable addition to the gastroenterology fellowship programs.

Eleven volatiles were screened as biomarkers by orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis, and hierarchical cluster analysis showed that these biomarkers could represent all volatiles to distinguish the spore release stage. The activities of lipoxygenase (LOX), hydroperoxide lyase, alcohol dehydrogenase, and alcohol acyltransferase were higher in L. edodes with spore release. Moreover, linolenic acid and phenylalanine metabolism were involved in aroma biosynthesis. One LOX-related gene and five aryl alcohol dehydrogenase-related genes could regulate the biosynthesis of 1-octen-3-ol, phenethyl alcohol, and phenylacetaldehyde.

The COVID-19 pandemic has a large impact in the routine of the many health services, including surgery, which demanded changes in assist protocols. Questions began to arise about well-established surgery conducts due to situations related to SARS-COV-2 infection, and, according to public health measures that are necessary to fight the pandemic. In situations of scarce available evidence, it is natural for us to have to deal with systematically more fragile, provisory and bias-susceptible information. Considering the principles that guide Evidence Based Medicine and Bioethical, the authors analyze the complexity of the medical decision-making during this time. Medical conducts must be adapted to the context of fighting the pandemic and consider patients and healthcare providers exposure and well-being and, lastly, the conservation of resources. The authors conclude that acceptance and tolerance to divergence is commendable, being a path to achieving unity in the diversity of medicine in times of little safe knowledge.","Nacul, Miguel Prestes; Azevedo, Marco AntÔnio",Rev Col Bras Cir,,394

This study was conducted to understand the experiences of students with preexisting mental health conditions or disabilities at a public university during COVID-19. We examined disruptions in the management of preexisting mental health conditions or disabilities and its impact on psychological well-being. Students were surveyed about their health care experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic between June and September 2020. Linear regressions and mediation analyses were conducted to examine the relationships between disruption to care, mental health self-efficacy, and four psychological well-being outcomes (stress, anxiety, depression, and overall distress). Of the total (N = 1,082) study participants, 258 (24%) reported having a preexisting mental health condition(s) or disabilities (81% female; Mage = 23.47). Of those, 155 (61%) reported that COVID-19 disrupted health care delivery and management of their conditions or disabilities. Of those who reported this disruption, 51% (n = 109) of participants reported a disruption in their ability to see a health care professional and 58% (n = 69) reported either that they lost care or that the quality of the new telemedicine care was not sufficient. A series of linear regressions revealed significant relationships between disruption to care and the four psychological outcomes. Mediation analyses revealed that depression, stress, anxiety, and overall distress were mediated by self-efficacy in managing mental health. University administrators and health care providers should evaluate the scope of mental health care and telemedicine services for students to help long-term psychological effects of COVID-19.","Ligus, Kaleigh; Fritzson, Emily; Hennessy, Emily A; Acabchuk, Rebecca L; Bellizzi, Keith",Transl Behav Med,,394
375703,Introduction to the special issue: Why the coronavirus crisis is also a crisis of leadership,2020,"BACKGROUND: There are several regimens recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for HER2-negative operable breast cancer. To our knowledge, no trials have yet been performed comparing these regimens head to head. We performed a network meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of NCCN-recommended chemotherapy regimens. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from inception to February 2020. We included randomized clinical trials comparing adjuvant regimens in predominantly node-positive operable breast cancer patients. We compared (1) DDACT, (2) TCx4 cycles, (3) TAC, and (4) ACWKT. Common comparators were (5) AC, (6) ACT, and (7) ACD. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. The Cochrane risk of bias tool assessed quality of the studies. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated as measures of treatment effects with AC as reference. We used Bayesian hierarchical random-effects models with noninformative priors for mixed multiple treatment comparisons. Effectiveness was estimated by disease-free and overall survival using ORs. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Safety outcomes included febrile neutropenia. RESULTS: We identified 7 randomized controlled trials with 16,332 patients. TC (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 0.71 [0.36-1.40]), TAC (0.77 [0.37-1.57]), ACWKT (0.68 [0.34-1.38]), and DDACT (0.72 [0.35-1.42]) were similar for overall survival. TC (0.64 [0.36-1.14]), TAC (0.67 [0.39-1.15]), ACWKT (0.63 [0.37-1.07]), and DDACT (0.59 [0.35-1.01]) had similar disease-free survival benefit. With regard to toxicity, TAC (2.67 [0.30-21.04]) had the highest odds of febrile neutropenia. CONCLUSION: The current generation of regimens are similar in efficacy. Given the lower toxicity of TCx4 comparatively, it is an acceptable alternative for lower-risk early-stage HER2-negative breast cancers.","John, Preethi; Osani, Mikala C; Kodali, Abhigna; Buchsbaum, Rachel; Bannuru, Raveendhara R; Erban, John K",,,394

An observational, cohort, prospective study with 30 days of observation was carried out to assess clinical outcomes in 88 patients hospitalized for Covid-19 pneumonia and treated with canakinumab (300 mg sc). Median time from diagnosis of Covid-19 by viral swab to administration of canakinumab was 7.5 days (range 0-30, IQR 4-11). Median PaO2/FiO2 increased from 160 (range 53-409, IQR 122-210) at baseline to 237 (range 72-533, IQR 158-331) at day 7 after treatment with canakinumab (p < 0.0001). Improvement of oxygen support category was observed in 61.4% of cases. Median duration of hospitalization following administration of canakinumab was 6 days (range 0-30, IQR 4-11). At 7 days, 58% of patients had been discharged and 12 (13.6%) had died. Significant differences between baseline and 7 days were observed for absolute lymphocyte counts (mean 0.60 vs 1.11 × 109/L, respectively, p < 0.0001) and C-reactive protein (mean 31.5 vs 5.8 mg/L, respectively, p < 0.0001).Overall survival at 1 month was 79.5% (95% CI 68.7-90.3). Oxygen-support requirements improved and overall mortality was 13.6%.

376744,From the Editor's desk,2020,"Entrepreneurs play crucial roles in global sustainable development, but limited financial resources constrain their performance and survival rate. Entrepreneurial finance discipline is, therefore, born to explore the connection between finance and entrepreneurship. Despite the global presence of entrepreneurship, the literature of entrepreneurial finance is suspected to be Western ideologically homogenous. Thus, the objective of this study is to examine the existence of Western ideological homogeneity in entrepreneurial finance literature. Employing the mindsponge mechanism and bibliometric analyses (Y-index and social structure), we analyze 412 highly cited publications extracted from Web of Science database and find Western ideological dominance as well as weak tolerance towards heterogeneity in the set of core ideologies of entrepreneurial finance. These results are consistent across author-, institution-, and country-levels, which reveals strong evidence for the existence of Western ideological homogeneity in the field. We recommend editors, reviewers, and authors to have proactive actions to diversify research topics and enhancing knowledge exchange to avoid the shortfalls of ideological homogeneity. Moreover, the synthesis of mindsponge mechanism and bibliometric analyses are suggested as a possible way to evaluate the state of ideological diversity in other scientific disciplines.","Nguyen, Minh-Hoang; Nguyen, Huyen Thanh T.; Pham, Thanh-Hang; Ho, Manh-Toan; Vuong, Quan-Hoang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.00016v1.pdf,394

Acceptance and adoption studies of IoT in higher education are scarce. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to explore the acceptance of the IoT by university professors for future adoption in higher education. An online survey was implemented based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), in a sample of 587 Spanish university teachers, aged between 21 and 58. The results showed that performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, and attitude toward using technology were influential in behavioral intention to use IoT. While the intention for use was similar between men and women and with respect to age. However, in the different constructs of the UTAUT model, the highest average scores were obtained in men and in teachers over 36 years of age. Finally, the findings and implications of the paper are discussed, showing empirical evidence on the adoption and acceptance of IoT in higher education in the context of Spain, highlighting the need for further research on emerging technologies in a context that is marked by COVID-19.","Romero-Rodríguez, José-María; Alonso-García, Santiago; Marín-Marín, José-Antonio; Gómez-García, Gerardo",Future Internet,,394

Research on SARS-CoV-2, as well as the closely related SARS-CoV-1 and MERS coronaviruses is restricted to BSL-3 facilities. Such BSL-3 classification makes SARS-CoV-2 research inaccessible to the majority of functioning research laboratories in the US;this becomes problematic when the collective scientific effort needs to be focused on such in the face of a pandemic. However, a minimal system capable of recapitulating different steps of the viral life cycle without using the virus' genetic material could increase accessibility. In this work, we assessed the four structural proteins from SARS-CoV-2 for their ability to form virus-like particles (VLPs) from human cells to form a competent system for BSL-2 studies of SARS-CoV-2. After establishing the minimal system requirements for VLP production, we examined their morphological relevance with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). VLPs produced with all four viral structural proteins were approximately 100 nm in diameter and bared the characteristic coronavirus crown or ?corona?. We next sought to evaluate the entry competency of our VLPs. GFP-tagged VLPs were generated by fluorescently tagging one of the four structural proteins used to produce VLPs. Once incorporation of the GFP-tagged protein into VLPs was confirmed, we used these GFP-VLPs to infect HEK293 cells. GFP-VLPs indeed did enter HEK293 cells and properly colocalized with endocytic markers Rab5 and LAMP1 in accordance with live virus data. To further evaluate viral entry, we made the VLP entry assay accessible to TEM analysis by replacing the GFP tag with an ascorbate peroxidase (APEX2) tag, which when oxidized produces a dark brown precipitate visible on micrographs. APEX2-VLPs were found to be entry-competent as well. In addition to entry, APEX2-VLPs yield the ability to visualize VLP assembly at the ER-Golgi intermediary complex (ERGIC) and for the first time we show localization of the structural proteins during SARS-CoV-2 VLP assembly, budding, and egress. In total, this research provides ample resources for other BSL-2 laboratories interested in joining the growing field to try and understand SARS-CoV-2 assembly, budding, and entry dynamics, biochemical and biophysical questions on the four structural proteins, and drug screening of viral assembly, budding, and/or entry inhibitors.","Plescia, Caroline David Emily Patra Dhabaleswar Sengupta Ranjan Amiar Souad Su Yuan Stahelin Robert",The FASEB Journal,,394

382100,A Method of Filter Implementation Using Heterogeneous Computing System for Driver Health Monitoring,2021,INTRODUCTION: Efficient detection of SARS-CoV-2 will continue to be an invaluable tool for pandemic control. Current instructions specify that the collection swab should be transported within its collection media to the laboratory. Developing a process whereby this swab is removed before transport to the lab would allow for improved automation and decreased manual manipulation of samples. METHODS: A proof of principle approach was taken by eluting viral particles from flocked swabs into collection buffer with and without a mucus background. Paired swab-free and swab-containing samples were transported to the laboratory and evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 (n = 28) or RNaseP (n = 6). SARS-CoV-2 amplification was performed using the Hologic Panther Fusion Aptima and RT-PCR assays. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all proof of principle samples with Ct values indicative of dilution. The rare exception was for a few samples where the dilution pushed the viral load below the LOD. Paired samples were 100% concordant for SARS-CoV-2 and RNaseP detection. CONCLUSION: Discarding the swab after inoculating the transport buffer is an appropriate pre-analytical modification. Adopting this approach can save up to 1 minute/sample. For labs processing more than 500 samples/day this equates to one full time equivalent shift/day.,"Greene, Dina N; Matthys, Tawna; Lockwood, Christina M",,,394
382583,NewsMeSH: A new classifier designed to annotate health news with MeSH headings,2021,"Objectives: The purpose of this study is to assess the performance of radiologists using a new software called ""COVID-19 score"" when performing chest radiography on patients potentially infected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Chest radiography (or chest X-ray, CXR) and CT are important for the imaging diagnosis of the coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19). CXR mobile devices are efficient during epidemies, because allow to reduce the risk of contagion and are easy to sanitize. Material and Methods: From February-April 2020, 14 radiologists retrospectively evaluated a pool of 312 chest X-ray exams to test a new software function for lung imaging analysis based on radiological features and graded on a three-point scale. This tool automatically generates a cumulative score (0-18). The intra- rater agreement (evaluated with Fleiss's method) and the average time for the compilation of the banner were calculated. Results: Fourteen radiologists evaluated 312 chest radiographs of COVID-19 pneumonia suspected patients (80 males and 38 females) with an average age of 64, 47 years. The inter-rater agreement showed a Fleiss' kappa value of 0.53 and the intra-group agreement varied from Fleiss' Kappa value between 0.49 and 0.59, indicating a moderate agreement (considering as ""moderate"" ranges 0.4-0.6). The years of work experience were irrelevant. The average time for obtaining the result with the automatic software was between 7 s (e.g., zero COVID-19 score) and 21 s (e.g., with COVID-19 score from 6 to 12). Conclusion: The use of automatic software for the generation of a CXR ""COVID-19 score"" has proven to be simple, fast, and replicable. Implementing this tool with scores weighed on the number of lung pathological areas, a useful parameter for clinical monitoring could be available.","Bagnera, Silvia; Bisanti, Francesca; Tibaldi, Claudia; Pasquino, Massimo; Berrino, Giulia; Ferraro, Roberta; Patania, Sebastiano",J Clin Imaging Sci,,394

384807,Opportunity Seldom Knocks Twice: Influencing China's Trajectory via Defend Forward and Persistent Engagement in Cyberspace,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in significant loss of radiologic volume as a result of shelter-at-home mandates and delay of non-time-sensitive imaging studies to preserve capacity for the pandemic. We analyze the volume-related impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on six academic medical systems (AMSs), three in high COVID-19 surge (high-surge) and three in low COVID-19 surge (low-surge) regions, and a large national private practice coalition. We sought to assess adaptations, risks of actions, and lessons learned. METHODS: Percent change of 2020 volume per week was compared with the corresponding 2019 volume calculated for each of the 14 imaging modalities and overall total, outpatient, emergency, and inpatient studies in high-surge AMSs and low-surge AMSs and the practice coalition. RESULTS: Steep examination volume drops occurred during week 11, with slow recovery starting week 17. The lowest total AMS volume drop was 40% compared with the same period the previous year, and the largest was 70%. The greatest decreases were seen with screening mammography and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans, and the smallest decreases were seen with PET/CT, x-ray, and interventional radiology. Inpatient volume was least impacted compared with outpatient or emergency imaging. CONCLUSION: Large percentage drops in volume were seen from weeks 11 through 17, were seen with screening studies, and were larger for the high-surge AMSs than for the low-surge AMSs. The lowest drops in volume were seen with modalities in which delays in imaging had greater perceived adverse consequences.","Norbash, Alexander M; Moore, Arl Van; Recht, Michael P; Brink, James A; Hess, Christopher P; Won, Jay J; Jain, Sonia; Sun, Xiaoying; Brown, Manuel; Enzmann, Dieter",J Am Coll Radiol,,394
385555,Rising to the challenge: Overcoming Shared Resource Laboratory biosafety challenges during a pandemic,2020,"PURPOSE: To analyze epidemiology and burden of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) in Italy. METHODS: We used Hospital Discharge Records and number of residents in Italy to calculate number and rate of hospitalization for Chagas disease, dengue, filariasis, leishmaniasis, schistosomiasis, strongyloidiasis, Taenia solium taeniasis, and cysticercosis by sex, citizenship group, and region in the period 2011-2016. RESULTS: 7195 hospitalizations for NTDs were retrieved, accounting for 7375 diagnoses, 60% in Italians and 40% in foreigners. Male-to-female ratio was 2; the age group more commonly affected was 25-44 years (32.5%). The most common diagnoses were leishmaniasis (34%), schistosomiasis (29%), strongyloidiasis (12%), Chagas disease (8%), and dengue (8%). Average yearly hospitalization rate per 100,000 residents for all NTDs was 2.05, 1.33, and 10.39 in general population, Italians, and foreign citizens, respectively. Hospitalization rates higher than 100 per 100,000 subjects were found in citizens from Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and Bolivia. CONCLUSIONS: NTDs have a not negligible burden in Italy. The most clinically relevant NTDs in Italy are leishmaniasis and schistosomiasis, followed by strongyloidiasis, Chagas disease, and dengue. Cystic echinococcosis, that was not included in the analysis since a similar study on this disease was recently published, should also be listed among the leading NTD in Italy. While schistosomiasis has its highest burden on population coming from highly endemic areas such as SSA, leishmaniasis is especially relevant in Italian-born residents of southern regions. Education at university and post-graduate levels, to increase the awareness of healthcare professionals on these topics, as well as targeted public health interventions (such as screening or presumptive treatment in high-risk groups), are an asset to improve clinical management and control of these diseases.","Tilli, Marta; Botta, Annarita; Bartoloni, Alessandro; Corti, Giampaolo; Zammarchi, Lorenzo",Infection,,394

No specific therapy for COVID-19 is not currently available, and urgent treatment solutions are needed. Recent studies have found several potential molecular targets, and one of the most critical proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus work machine is the Papain-like protease (Plpro). Potential inhibitors are available, and their X-ray crystallographic structures in complex with this enzyme have been determined recently. However, their activities against this enzyme are insufficient and need to be characterized and improved to be of clinical values. Therefore, in this work, by utilizing the Supervised Molecular Dynamics (SuMD) simulation method, we achieved multiple unbinding events of Plpro inhibitors, GRL0617, and its derivates, and captured and understood the details of the unbinding pathway. We found that residues of the BL2 loop, such as Tyr268 and Gln269, play major roles in the unbinding pathways, but the most important contributing factor is the natural movements and behavior of the BL2 loop, which can control the entire process. We believe that the details found in this study can be used to refine and optimize potential inhibitors like GRL0617 and design more efficacious inhibitors as a treatment for the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Sohraby, Farzin; Aryapour, Hassan",PLoS One,,394
386317,Improving training for surgeons of the future: the consultant thoracic surgeon,2020,"Background: Migration is a challenging life transition that may be a source of various problems related to well-being and mental health. However, the psychological adaptation of migrants may be potentially facilitated by social self-efficacy-the beliefs in one's ability to initiate and maintain interpersonal relationships. Previous research suggests that social self-efficacy is positively related to adjustment and negatively related to loneliness, depression, and psychological distress. Research also confirms that self-efficacy beliefs can be effectively enhanced using Internet-based interventions. These results served as a background for creating the New in Town, a self-help Internet-based intervention for internal migrants in Poland that aims at increasing social self-efficacy. Exercises in the intervention are based on the principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and relate to sources of self-efficacy beliefs: mastery experiences, vicarious experiences, verbal persuasions, and emotional and physiological states. Users complete increasingly challenging tasks that encourage them to interact with their environment. The aim of this trial was to investigate the efficacy of the New in Town intervention. Methods: The efficacy of the New in Town intervention will be tested in a two-arm randomized controlled trial with a waitlist control group. Social self-efficacy will be the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes will include loneliness, perceived social support, and satisfaction with life. Additionally, we will measure user experience among participants allocated to the experimental group. We aim to recruit a total of Nâ¯=â¯280 participants aged at least 18â¯years who have changed their place of residence in the last 6â¯months and have an Internet connection. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 3-week post-test, and 8-week follow-up. Discussion: The trial will provide insights into the efficacy of Internet-based self-help interventions in increasing social self-efficacy. Given that the intervention works, New in Town could provide an easily accessible support option for internal migrants in Poland.

A direct effect of SARS-COV-2 on the central nervous system (CNS) has been hypothesized. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the presence of delirium in older patients admitted for a suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 and its impact on in-hospital mortality. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: 91 patients, aged 70-years and older, admitted to an acute geriatric ward in Northern Italy from March 8th to April 17th, 2020. METHODS: COVID-19 cases were confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay for SARS-Cov-2 RNA from nasal and pharyngeal swabs. Delirium was diagnosed by two geriatricians according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders V (DMS V) criteria. The number of chronic diseases was calculated among a pre-defined list of 60. The pre-disease Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) was assessed at hospital admission. RESULTS: Of the total sample, 39 patients died, 49 were discharged and 3 were transferred to ICU. Twenty-five patients (27.5%) had delirium. Seventy-two percent of patients with delirium died during hospitalization compared to 31.8% of those without delirium. In a multivariate logistic regression model adjusted for potential confounders, patients with delirium were four times more likely to die during hospital stay compared to those without delirium (OR = 3.98;95%CI = 1.05-17.28; p = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS: Delirium is common in older patients with COVID-19 and strongly associated with in-hospital mortality. Regardless of causation, either due to a direct effect of SARS-COV-2 on the CNS or to a multifactorial cause, delirium should be interpreted as an alarming prognostic indicator in older people.","Marengoni, Alessandra; Zucchelli, Alberto; Grande, Giulia; Fratiglioni, Laura; Rizzuto, Debora",Age Ageing,,394

The Embase, Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Literature, PubMed, Scientific Electronic Library Online, Scopus, LIVIVO, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, OpenThesis, and Open Access Thesis and Dissertations databases were used. Only randomized controlled trials without restrictions on the year or language of publication were included. Two reviewers assessed the risk of bias using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool. A meta-analysis using a random-effects model estimated the combined relative risk (RR). The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations approach was used to assess the certainty of the evidence. Initially, 2,337 studies were identified, of which 4 were considered in the systematic review and 3 in the meta-analysis (total sample: 796 patients). The studies were published between 2009 and 2017. All eligible studies had a low risk of bias. The meta-analysis revealed that the risk of VAP was 24% lower in patients receiving chlorhexidine combined with toothbrushing than in those receiving chlorhexidine alone (RR: 0.76; 95% confidence interval: 0.55-1.06), with moderate certainty of evidence and without statistical significance. In conclusion, considering the limitations of this study, a standard protocol for the prevention of VAP is not yet recommended. More studies with larger sample sizes are needed to draw strong conclusions. However, considering that toothbrushing is a simple intervention, it should be a common practice in mechanically ventilated patients, especially among patients with coronavirus disease.","Silva, Pedro Urquiza Jayme; Paranhos, Luiz Renato; Meneses-Santos, Daniela; Blumenberg, Cauane; Macedo, Dhiancarlo Rocha; Cardoso, Sérgio Vitorino",Clinics,,394

The authors grouped the patients into two groups according to the vitamin D levels measured at the time of admission into the hospital and reported that lower vitamin D levels are associated with elevated D-dimer and IL-6 levels, low CD4/CD8 ratio and compromised clinical findings with elevated LIPI and SOFA scores. However, review of recent literature shows this association to be debatable. The 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in the initial phase of critical illness have been reported to drop rapidly and hence consideration of the time of measurement from symptom onset would have enhanced the clinical relevance of these findings. Inferred association between vitamin D levels and disease severity based on SOFA score in COVID-19 patients, needs to be further explored in the light of the recent literature which casts doubt on using SOFA score at admission to predict mortality in COVID-19.","Lohia, Prateek; Kapur, Shweta; Patel, Pragnesh; Seyoum, Berhane",Respir Res,,394
389759,Making the Move Online: Interactive Read‐Alouds for the Virtual Classroom,2021,"Understanding the transmission phenomena of SARS-CoV-2 by virus-laden droplets and aerosols is of paramount importance for controlling the current COVID-19 pandemic. Detailed information about the lifetime and kinematics of airborne droplets of different size is relevant in order to evaluate hygiene measures like wearing masks but also social distancing and ventilation concepts for indoor environments. However, the evaporation process of expiratory droplets and aerosols is not fully understood. Consequently, the main objective of this study is to present evaporation characteristics of saliva droplets. An acoustic levitator is utilized in conjunction with microscopic imaging for recording the temporal evolution of the evaporation of saliva droplets under well-defined ambient conditions. Following the evaporation of the water content, a saliva droplet reaches a final size, which remains stable in the timescale of hours. By investigating numerous droplets of different size, it was found that the final droplet diameter correlates well to 20 % of the initial diameter. This correlation is independent of the ambient conditions for a temperature range from 20 °C to 29 °C and a relative humidity from 6 % to up to 65 %. The experimentally obtained evaporation characteristics are implemented into a numerical model, which is based on one-dimensional droplet kinematics and a rapid mixing evaporation model. By taking into account the evaporation-falling curve as presented by Wells, the significance of the experimental results for predicting the lifetime of saliva droplets and aerosols is demonstrated. The numerical predictions may be used to determine the impact of the droplet size and the ambient conditions on the transmission risks of infectious diseases like COVID-19.","Lieber, Christian; Melekidis, Stefanos; Koch, Rainer; Bauer, Hans-Jörg",J Aerosol Sci,,394

There is a link between the new coronavirus and changes in biochemical indicators, such as coagulation functions. Hypercoagulable state of blood caused by infections may lead to cerebrovascular diseases. More attention should be paid to patients with COVID-19, especially critically ill individuals with history of cerebrovascular disease who may have high risk of stroke. METHODS: 193 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. These patients were categorized into nonsevere (143 patients) and severe (50 patients) groups. This study evaluated laboratory tests, including routine blood tests, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, electrolytes, and coagulation functions. Furthermore, neurological function and stroke risks were evaluated in this study. RESULTS: Compared to the nonsevere group, there were increases in white blood cells, neutrophil count, interleukin-6, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein in the severe group (p < .05). For coagulation functions, parameters like prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, D-dimer, and fibrin degradation products were increased significantly in the severe group (p < .01). Severe patients also demonstrated higher scores on the Framingham stroke risk profile and lower Glasgow scores (p < .05). Furthermore, significant associations were noticed between stroke risk and age, blood cell count, neutrophil count, D-dimmer, and fibrin degradation productions (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Data suggested that coagulation functions were affected in patients with COVID-19. Hypercoagulable state in patients may lead to potential high risk of stroke.","Qiu, Feng; Wu, Yue; Zhang, Aiqing; Xie, Guojin; Cao, Hui; Du, Mingyang; Jiang, Haibo; Li, Shun; Ding, Ming",Brain Behav,,394
391152,Impact of Virtual Anatomy on Assessment Outcomes,2021,"Saliva plays major roles in the human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2. If the virus in saliva in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals can be rapidly and efficiently inactivated by a beverage, the ingestion of the beverage may attenuate the spread of virus infection within a population. Recently, we reported that SARS-CoV-2 was significantly inactivated by treatment with black tea, green tea, roasted green tea and oolong tea, as well as their constituents, (-) epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), theasinensin A (TSA), and galloylated theaflavins. However, it remains unclear to what extent tea inactivates the virus present in saliva, because saliva contains various proteins, nitrogenous products, electrolytes, and so on, which could influence the antivirus effect of tea. Here, we assessed whether tea inactivated the SARS-CoV-2 which was added in human saliva. A virus was added in healthy human saliva in vitro, and after treatment with black tea or green tea, the infectivity of the virus was evaluated by TCID50 assays. The virus titer fell below the detectable level or less than 1/100 after treatment with black tea or green tea for 10 s. The black tea-treated virus less remarkably replicated in cells compared with the untreated virus. These findings suggest the possibility that the ingestion of tea may inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in saliva in infected individuals, although clinical studies are required to determine the intensity and duration of the anti-viral effect of tea in saliva in humans.","Ohgitani, Eriko Shin-Ya Masaharu Ichitani Masaki Kobayashi Makoto Takihara Takanobu Kawamoto Masaya Kinugasa Hitoshi Mazda Osam",Pathogens,,394
391680,Near Real-Time Social Distancing in London,2020-12-07,"Since December 2019, countries around the world have been struggling with the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Case series have reported that people with obesity experience more severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). During the COVID-19 pandemic, people have tended to gain weight because of environmental factors imposed by quarantine policies, such as decreased physical activity and increased consumption of unhealthy food. Mechanisms have been postulated to explain the association between COVID-19 and obesity. COVID-19 aggravates inflammation and hypoxia in people with obesity, which can lead to severe illness and the need for intensive care. The immune system is compromised in people with obesity and COVID-19 affects the immune system, which can lead to complications. Interleukin-6 and other cytokines play an important role in the progression of COVID-19. The inflammatory response, critical illness, and underlying risk factors may all predispose to complications of obesity such as diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. The common medications used to treat people with obesity, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues, statins, and antiplatelets agents, should be continued because these agents have anti-inflammatory properties and play protective roles against cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. It is also recommended that renin-angiotensin system blockers are not stopped during the COVID-19 pandemic because no definitive data about the harm or benefits of these agents have been reported. During the COVID-19 pandemic, social activities have been discouraged and exercise facilities have been closed. Under these restrictions, tailored lifestyle modifications such as home exercise training and cooking of healthy food are encouraged.","Lim, Soo; Shin, Soo Myoung; Nam, Ga Eun; Jung, Chang Hee; Koo, Bo Kyung",,,394
391916,A novel multiple instance learning framework for COVID-19 severity assessment via data augmentation and self-supervised learning,2021,"BACKGROUND: Post-mortem studies can provide important information for understanding new diseases and small autopsy case series have already reported different findings in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We evaluated whether some specific post-mortem features are observed in these patients and if these changes are related to the presence of the virus in different organs. Complete macroscopic and microscopic autopsies were performed on different organs in 17 COVID-19 non-survivors. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated with immunohistochemistry (IHC) in lung samples and with real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test in the lung and other organs. RESULTS: Pulmonary findings revealed early-stage diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) in 15 out of 17 patients and microthrombi in small lung arteries in 11 patients. Late-stage DAD, atypical pneumocytes, and/or acute pneumonia were also observed. Four lung infarcts, two acute myocardial infarctions, and one ischemic enteritis were observed. There was no evidence of myocarditis, hepatitis, or encephalitis. Kidney evaluation revealed the presence of hemosiderin in tubules or pigmented casts in most patients. Spongiosis and vascular congestion were the most frequently encountered brain lesions. No specific SARS-CoV-2 lesions were observed in any organ. IHC revealed positive cells with a heterogeneous distribution in the lungs of 11 of the 17 (65%) patients; RT-PCR yielded a wide distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in different tissues, with 8 patients showing viral presence in all tested organs (i.e., lung, heart, spleen, liver, colon, kidney, and brain). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, autopsies revealed a great heterogeneity of COVID-19-associated organ injury and the remarkable absence of any specific viral lesions, even when RT-PCR identified the presence of the virus in many organs.","Remmelink, Myriam; De Mendonça, Ricardo; D039,; Haene, Nicky; De Clercq, Sarah; Verocq, Camille; Lebrun, Laetitia; Lavis, Philomène; Racu, Marie-Lucie; Trépant, Anne-Laure; Maris, Calliope; Rorive, Sandrine; Goffard, Jean-Christophe; De Witte, Olivier; Peluso, Lorenzo; Vincent, Jean-Louis; Decaestecker, Christine; Taccone, Fabio Silvio; Salmon, Isabelle",Crit Care,,394

The suite of Business Risk Management (BRM) programs, developed decades ago and without any thought to the possibility of a global pandemic, are meant to assist farmers in managing risks. This article discusses to what extent these BRM programs, and more broadly government programs, assisted farmers in managing risks brought on by the pandemic. Despite calls by industry for significant additional public funds, we find that COVID‐19 exposed no significant gaps in BRM programming and therefore we see no reason for more funding to be funneled to the farm sector through BRM programming.

La suite de programmes de gestion des risques de l'entreprise (GRE), développés il y a des décennies et sans aucune réflexion sur la possibilité d'une pandémie mondiale, sont destinés à aider les agriculteurs à gérer les risques. Cet article explique dans quelle mesure ces programmes de GRE, et plus largement les programmes gouvernementaux, ont aidé les agriculteurs à gérer les risques induits par la pandémie. Malgré les appels de l'industrie pour des fonds publics supplémentaires importants, nous constatons que COVID‐19 n'a révélé aucune lacune significative dans la suite GRE et, par conséquent, nous ne voyons aucune raison pour que plus de financement soit acheminé vers le secteur agricole par le biais de la GRE.

Methods: This was a retrospective, single-center research study. Participants were enrolled from patients presenting at the Chongqing Public Health Medical Treatment Center from Jan 24 to Feb 7, 2020, and were confirmed as having COVID-19. Results: A total of 114 COVID-19 patients (99 mild, 4 severe, 11 critical) of which 56 (56/114; 49.1%) were male, 58 (58/114; 50.9%) were female with a mean age of 46.05 years. Twenty nine (29/114; 25.44%) patients suffered from chronic diseases. Neutrophils counts in 23.68% (27/114) of patients were abnormally low and abnormally high in 21.05% (24/114). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the C-reactive protein levels were abnormally elevated in 76.5% (62/81) and 62.9% (66/105) of patients, respectively. Creatine kinase isoenzymes (CK-MB), pro-brain natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) and troponin levels were above the normal range in 7.10% (8/112), 66.7% (10/15), and 100% of patients, respectively. The percentage of patients in which the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2)/fraction of inspired O 2(FiO 2) ratio exceeded 200 was 60%. A total of 91 (91/114; 79.82%) patients displayed severe bilateral pneumonia, 52 (52/114; 45.61%) exhibited ground-glass opacity, and pulmonary consolidation was observed in 4 (3.51%) patients. Differences in shortness of breath, insomnia, inappetence, the procalcitonin (PCT) levels, FiO 2and PaO 2/FiO 2among the three groups were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05).

398820,Italy: Political Data and Developments in 2019,2020,"BACKGROUND: Adults infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have had high rates of thrombosis. A novel condition in children infected with SARS-CoV-2, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), has limited data on their prothrombotic state or need for thromboprophylaxis. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to analyze the prothrombotic state using coagulation profiles, rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) parameters and clinical outcomes, to determine if this could aid in risk stratification for thromboprophylaxis. METHODS: This analysis included patients (<21 years of age) with a diagnosis of MIS-C (n = 40) and controls (presenting with suspicion of MIS-C but later ruled out; n = 26). RESULTS: MIS-C patients had higher levels of inflammatory markers including D-dimer (p < .0001), compared with controls, along with evidence of hypercoagulability on ROTEM with elevated evaluation of fibrinogen activity (FIBTEM) maximum clot firmness (MCF) (p < .05). For MIS-C patients with D-dimers >1000 ng/ml, there was a significant correlation of FIBTEM MCF (p < .0001) with a mean value of 37.4 (standard deviation 5.1). D-dimer >2144 ng/ml was predictive of intensive care unit admission (area under the curve [AUC] 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.60-0.99; p < .01; sensitivity: 82%, specificity: 75%), and elevated FIBTEM MCF (AUC 1 for >2500 ng/ml). MIS-C patients (50%) received enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis (in addition to aspirin) with significant improvement in their inflammatory and ROTEM parameters upon outpatient follow-up; none developed symptomatic thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: Despite an observed prothrombotic state, none of the MIS-C patients (on aspirin alone or in combination with enoxaparin) developed symptomatic thrombosis. ROTEM, in addition to coagulation profiles, may be helpful to tailor thromboprophylaxis in critically ill MIS-C patients.","Al-Ghafry, Maha; Vagrecha, Anshul; Malik, Marium; Levine, Chana; Uster, Eliza; Aygun, Banu; Appiah-Kubi, Abena; Vlachos, Adrianna; Capone, Christine A; Rajan, Sujatha; Palumbo, Nancy; Misra, Nilanjana; Mitchell, Elizabeth C; Wolfe, Lawrence C; Lipton, Jeffrey M; Shore-Lesserson, Linda; Acharya, Suchitra S",J Thromb Haemost,,394

ObjectiveTo examine 30-day outcomes in Canadians infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the first year of the pandemic and to compare event rates in those with VOC versus wild-type infection. DesignRetrospective cohort study using linked healthcare administrative datasets. SettingAlberta and Ontario, the two Canadian provinces that experienced the largest third wave in the spring of 2021. ParticipantsAll individuals with a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction swab from March 1, 2020 until March 31, 2021, with genomic confirmation of VOC screen-positive tests during February and March 2021 (wave 3). Exposure of InterestVOC versus wild type SARS-CoV-2 Main Outcomes and MeasuresAll-cause hospitalizations or death within 30 days after a positive SARS-CoV-2 swab. ResultsCompared to the 372,741 individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 2020 and January 2021 (waves 1 and 2 in Canada), there was a shift in transmission towards younger patients in the 104,232 COVID-19 cases identified in wave 3. As a result, although third wave patients were more likely to be hospitalized (aOR 1.34 [1.29-1.39] in Ontario and aOR 1.53 [95%CI 1.41-1.65] in Alberta), they had shorter lengths of stay (median 5 vs. 7 days, p<0.001) and were less likely to die within 30 days (aOR 0.66 [0.60-0.71] in Ontario and aOR 0.74 [0.62-0.89] in Alberta). However, within the third wave, patients infected with VOC (91% Alpha) exhibited higher risks of death (aOR 1.52 [1.27-1.81] in Ontario and aOR 1.67 [1.13-2.48] in Alberta) and hospitalization (aOR 1.57 [1.47-1.69] in Ontario and aOR 1.88 [1.74-2.02] in Alberta) than those with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 infections during the same timeframe. Conclusions and RelevanceOn a population basis, the shift towards younger age groups as the COVID-19 pandemic has evolved translates into more hospitalizations but shorter lengths of stay and lower mortality risk than seen in the first 10 months of the pandemic in Canada. However, on an individual basis, infection with a VOC is associated with a higher risk of hospitalization or death than the original wild-type SARS-CoV-2 - this is important information to address vaccine hesitancy given the increasing frequency of VOC infections now.","McAlister, Finlay A; Nabipoor, Majid; Chu, Anna; Lee, Douglas; Saxinger, Lynora; Bakal, Jeffrey",,,394

Simons",2020,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic in-person visits for patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices should be replaced by remote monitoring (RM), in order to prevent viral transmission. A direct home-delivery service of the RM communicator has been implemented at 49 Italian arrhythmia centers. METHODS: According to individual patient preference or the organizational decision of the center, patients were assigned to the home-delivery group or the standard in-clinic delivery group. In the former case, patients received telephone training on the activation process and use of the communicator. In June 2020, the centers were asked to reply to an ad hoc questionnaire to describe and evaluate their experience in the previous 3 months. RESULTS: RM was activated in 1324 patients: 821 (62%) received the communicator at home and the communicator was activated remotely. Activation required one additional call in 49% of cases, and the median time needed to complete the activation process was 15 min [25th-75th percentile: 10-20]. 753 (92%) patients were able to complete the correct activation of the system. At the time when the questionnaire was completed, 743 (90%) communicators were regularly transmitting data. The service was generally deemed useful (96% of respondents) in facilitating the activation of RM during the COVID-19 pandemic and possibly beyond. CONCLUSIONS: Home delivery of the communicator proved to be a successful approach to system activation, and received positive feedback from clinicians. The increased use of a RM protocol will reduce risks for both providers and patients, while maintaining high-quality care.","Magnocavallo, Michele; Bernardini, Alessia; Mariani, Marco Valerio; Piro, Agostino; Marini, Massimiliano; Nicosia, Antonino; Adduci, Carmen; Rapacciuolo, Antonio; Saporito, Davide; Grossi, Stefano; Santarpia, Giuseppe; Vaccaro, Paola; Rordorf, Roberto; Pentimalli, Francesco; Giunta, Giuseppe; Campari, Monica; Valsecchi, Sergio; Lavalle, Carlo",Pacing Clin Electrophysiol,,394

The standard clinical practice suddenly shifted to the use of telepsychology. This study aimed to identify how therapists have been responding to the public health crisis and the rapid transition to telepsychology. We distributed a survey to 502 mental health providers to investigate the challenges and concerns of the delivery of clinical work during the pandemic. Our study found that most therapists (75.9%) transitioned to telepsychology without suspension of services. Therapists reported varied concerns regarding telepsychology, clinical practice, and their personal lives. The most common concerns identified were the use of therapeutic techniques in telepsychology, provision of remote services, and the practitioner's own health. Our findings also indicated that therapists who are students, female, sexual minorities, unpartnered, and working in public settings experienced relatively greater concerns. It may imperative to allocate more resources to those subgroups of therapists to facilitate their clinical work in telepsychology. This study contributed to our understanding of how the pandemic has impacted clinical work and may inform practitioners in coping with the current and any future public crises.","Lin, Tao; Stone, Suzannah J; Anderson, Timothy",Behav Med,,394

403528,Expanding the conceptual domain of governance in franchising,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic poses a great threat to global public health. Meanwhile, there is massive misinformation associated with the pandemic which advocates unfounded or unscientific claims. Even major social media and news outlets have made an extra effort in debunking COVID-19 misinformation, most of the fact-checking information is in English, whereas some unmoderated COVID-19 misinformation is still circulating in other languages, threatening the health of less-informed people in immigrant communities and developing countries. In this paper, we make the first attempt to detect COVID-19 misinformation in a low-resource language (Chinese) only using the fact-checked news in a high-resource language (English). We start by curating a Chinese real&fake news dataset according to existing fact-checking information. Then, we propose a deep learning framework named CrossFake to jointly encode the cross-lingual news body texts and capture the news content as much as possible. Empirical results on our dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of CrossFake under the cross-lingual setting and it also outperforms several monolingual and cross-lingual fake news detectors. The dataset is available at https://github.com/YingtongDou/CrossFake.","Du, Jiangshu; Dou, Yingtong; Xia, Congying; Cui, Limeng; Ma, Jing; Yu, Philip S.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.06495v2.pdf,394

The fitted forecasting models revealed high exponential growth in the number of confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries in Pakistan. Based on our model prediction the number of confirmed cases will be increased by 2.7 times, 95% prediction interval for the number of cases at the end of May 2020 = (5681 to 33079). There could be up to 500 deaths, 95% prediction interval = (168 to 885) and there could be eightfold increase in the number of recoveries, 95% prediction interval = (2391 to 16126). The forecasting results of COVID-19 are alarming for May in Pakistan. The health officials and government should adopt new strategies to control the pandemic from further spread until a proper treatment or vaccine is developed.","Yousaf, Muhammad; Zahir, Samiha; Riaz, Muhammad; Hussain, Sardar Muhammad; Shah, Kamal",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,394
403860,Schadenfreude After Watching the News: How Audiences Respond to Media Coverage of Partisans Disclosing Illnesses,2021,"As the COVID-19 pandemic began to sweep across the US it elicited a wide spectrum of responses, both online and offline, across the population. To aid the development of effective spatially targeted interventions in the midst of this turmoil, it is important to understand the geolocalization of these online emotional responses, as well as their association with offline behavioral responses. Here, we analyze around 13 million geotagged tweets in 49 cities across the US from the first few months of the pandemic to assess regional dependence in online sentiments with respect to a few major topics, and how these sentiments correlate with policy development and human mobility. Surprisingly, we observe universal trends in overall and topic-based sentiments across cities over the time period studied, with variability primarily seen only in the immediate impact of federal guidelines and local lockdown policies. We also find that these local sentiments are highly correlated with and predictive of city-level mobility, while the correlations between sentiments and local cases and deaths are relatively weak. Our findings point to widespread commonalities in the online public emotional responses to COVID across the US, both temporally and relative to offline indicators, in contrast with the high variability seen in early local containment policies. This study also provides new insights into the use of social media data in crisis management by integrating offline data to gain an in-depth understanding of public emotional responses, policy development, and local mobility.","Feng, Shihui; Kirkley, Alec",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.10461v1.pdf,394

405179,Emotions and politics of sensibilities in Latin America,2021,"BACKGROUND: Accompanying the rising rates of reported mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic has been a reported increase in the use of digital technologies to manage health generally, and mental health more specifically. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to systematically examine whether there was a COVID-19 pandemic-related increase in the self-reported use of digital mental health tools and other technologies to manage mental health. METHODS: We analyzed results from a survey of 5907 individuals in the United States using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk); the survey was administered during 4 week-long periods in 2020 and survey respondents were from all 50 states and Washington DC. The first set of analyses employed two different logistic regression models to estimate the likelihood of having symptoms indicative of clinical depression and anxiety, respectively, as a function of the rate of COVID-19 cases per 10 people and survey time point. The second set employed seven different logistic regression models to estimate the likelihood of using seven different types of digital mental health tools and other technologies to manage one's mental health, as a function of symptoms indicative of clinical depression and anxiety, rate of COVID-19 cases per 10 people, and survey time point. These models also examined potential interactions between symptoms of clinical depression and anxiety, respectively, and rate of COVID-19 cases. All models controlled for respondent sociodemographic characteristics and state fixed effects. RESULTS: Higher COVID-19 case rates were associated with a significantly greater likelihood of reporting symptoms of depression (odds ratio [OR] 2.06, 95% CI 1.27-3.35), but not anxiety (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.77-1.88). Survey time point, a proxy for time, was associated with a greater likelihood of reporting clinically meaningful symptoms of depression and anxiety (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.12-1.27 and OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.05-1.19, respectively). Reported symptoms of depression and anxiety were associated with a greater likelihood of using each type of technology. Higher COVID-19 case rates were associated with a significantly greater likelihood of using mental health forums, websites, or apps (OR 2.70, 95% CI 1.49-4.88), and other health forums, websites, or apps (OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.55-4.34). Time was associated with increased odds of reported use of mental health forums, websites, or apps (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.11-1.30), phone-based or text-based crisis lines (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.10-1.31), and online, computer, or console gaming/video gaming (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.05-1.19). Interactions between COVID-19 case rate and mental health symptoms were not significantly associated with any of the technology types. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggested increased use of digital mental health tools and other technologies over time during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, additional effort is urgently needed to consider the quality of these products, either by ensuring users have access to evidence-based and evidence-informed technologies and/or by providing them with the skills to make informed decisions around their potential efficacy.","Sorkin, Dara H; Janio, Emily A; Eikey, Elizabeth V; Schneider, Margaret; Davis, Katelyn; Schueller, Stephen M; Stadnick, Nicole A; Zheng, Kai; Neary, Martha; Safani, David; Mukamel, Dana B",J Med Internet Res,,394

406405,Corona Crisis and Inequality: Why Management Research Needs a Societal Turn,2020,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported from China in January, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 is efficiently transmitted from person to person and, in 2 months, has caused more than 82â000 laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 2800 deaths in 46 countries. The total number of cases and deaths has surpassed that of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Although both COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) manifest as pneumonia, COVID-19 is associated with apparently more efficient transmission, fewer cases of diarrhoea, increased mental confusion, and a lower crude fatality rate. However, the underlying virus-host interactive characteristics conferring these observations on transmissibility and clinical manifestations of COVID-19 remain unknown. Methods: We systematically investigated the cellular susceptibility, species tropism, replication kinetics, and cell damage of SARS-CoV-2 and compared findings with those for SARS-CoV. We compared SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV replication in different cell lines with one-way ANOVA. For the area under the curve comparison between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV replication in Calu3 (pulmonary) and Caco2 (intestinal) cells, we used Student's t test. We analysed cell damage induced by SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV with one-way ANOVA. Findings: SARS-CoV-2 infected and replicated to comparable levels in human Caco2 cells and Calu3 cells over a period of 120 h (p=0·52). By contrast, SARS-CoV infected and replicated more efficiently in Caco2 cells than in Calu3 cells under the same multiplicity of infection (p=0·0098). SARS-CoV-2, but not SARS-CoV, replicated modestly in U251 (neuronal) cells (p=0·036). For animal species cell tropism, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replicated in non-human primate, cat, rabbit, and pig cells. SARS-CoV, but not SARS-CoV-2, infected and replicated in Rhinolophus sinicus bat kidney cells. SARS-CoV-2 consistently induced significantly delayed and milder levels of cell damage than did SARS-CoV in non-human primate cells (VeroE6, p=0·016; FRhK4, p=0·0004). Interpretation: As far as we know, our study presents the first quantitative data for tropism, replication kinetics, and cell damage of SARS-CoV-2. These data provide novel insights into the lower incidence of diarrhoea, decreased disease severity, and reduced mortality in patients with COVID-19, with respect to the pathogenesis and high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 compared with SARS-CoV.

406484,COVID-19: A Boon for Tropical Solar Parks?: A Time Series Based Analysis and Forecasting of Solar Irradiance,2020,"BACKGROUND: Interleukin 6 (IL-6) blocking agents have been used for treating severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Their immunosuppressive effect might be valuable in patients with COVID-19 characterised by substantial immune system dysfunction by controlling inflammation and promoting disease tolerance. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of IL-6 blocking agents compared to standard care alone or with placebo on efficacy and safety outcomes in COVID-19. We will update this assessment regularly. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (up to 11 February 2021) and the L-OVE platform, and Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register to identify trials up to 26 February 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating IL-6 blocking agents compared with standard care alone or with placebo for people with COVID-19, regardless of disease severity. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. The protocol was amended to reduce the number of outcomes considered. Two review authors independently collected data and assessed the risk of bias with the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool. We rated the certainty of evidence with the GRADE approach for the critical outcomes such as clinical improvement (defined as hospital discharge or improvement on the scale used by trialists to evaluate clinical progression or recovery) (day (D) 28 / &#8805; D60); WHO Clinical Progression Score of level 7 or above (i.e. the proportion of participants with mechanical ventilation +/- additional organ support OR death) (D28 / &#8805; D60); all-cause mortality (D28 / &#8805; D60); incidence of any adverse events; and incidence of serious adverse events. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 10 RCTs with available data including one platform trial comparing tocilizumab and sarilumab with standard of care. These trials evaluated tocilizumab (nine RCTs including two platform trials; seven were reported as peer-reviewed articles, two as preprints; 6428 randomised participants); and two sarilumab (one platform trial reported as peer reviewed article, one reported as preprint, 880 randomised participants). All trials included were multicentre trials. They were conducted in Brazil, China, France, Italy, UK, USA, and four were multi-country trials. The mean age range of participants ranged from 56 to 65 years; 4572 (66.3%) of trial participants were male. Disease severity ranged from mild to critical disease. The reported proportion of participants on oxygen at baseline but not intubated varied from 56% to 100% where reported. Five trials reported the inclusion of intubated patients at baseline. We identified a further 20 registered RCTs of tocilizumab compared to placebo/standard care (five completed without available results, five terminated without available results, eight ongoing, two not recruiting); 11 RCTs of sarilumab (two completed without results, three terminated without available results, six ongoing); six RCTs of clazakisumab (five ongoing, one not recruiting); two RCTs of olokizumab (one completed, one not recruiting); one of siltuximab (ongoing) and one RCT of levilimab (completed without available results). Of note, three were cancelled (2 tocilizumab, 1 clazakisumab). One multiple-arm RCT evaluated both tocilizumab and sarilumab compared to standard of care, one three-arm RCT evaluated tocilizumab and siltuximab compared to standard of care and consequently they appear in each respective comparison. Tocilizumab versus standard care alone or with placebo a. Effectiveness of tocilizumab for patients with COVID-19 Tocilizumab probably results in little or no increase in the outcome of clinical improvement at D28 (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.13; I2 = 40.9%; 7 RCTs, 5585 participants; absolute effect: 31 more with clinical improvement per 1000 (from 0 fewer to 67 more); moderate-certainty evidence). However, we cannot exclude that some subgroups of patients could benefit from the treatment. We did not obtain data for longer-term follow-up (&#8805; D60). The effect of tocilizumab on the proportion of participants with a WHO Clinical Progression Score of level of 7 or above is uncertain at D28 (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.74; I2 = 64.4%; 3 RCTs, 712 participants; low-certainty evidence). We did not obtain data for longer-term follow-up (&#8805; D60). Tocilizumab reduces all-cause mortality at D28 compared to standard care alone or placebo (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97; I2 = 0.0%; 8 RCTs, 6363 participants; absolute effect: 32 fewer deaths per 1000 (from 52 fewer to 9 fewer); high-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests uncertainty around the effect on mortality at &#8805; D60 (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.40; I2 = 0.0%; 2 RCTs, 519 participants; low-certainty evidence). b. Safety of tocilizumab for patients with COVID-19 The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of tocilizumab on adverse events (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.72; I2 = 86.4%; 7 RCTs, 1534 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Nevertheless, tocilizumab probably results in slightly fewer serious adverse events than standard care alone or placebo (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.06; I2 = 0.0%; 8 RCTs, 2312 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Sarilumab versus standard care alone or with placebo The evidence is uncertain about the effect of sarilumab on all-cause mortality at D28 (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.36; 2 RCTs, 880 participants; low certainty), on all-cause mortality at &#8805; D60 (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.0; 1 RCT, 420 participants; low certainty), and serious adverse events (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.77; 2 RCTs, 880 participants; low certainty). It is unlikely that sarilumab results in an important increase of adverse events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.25; 1 RCT, 420 participants; moderate certainty). However, an increase cannot be excluded No data were available for other critical outcomes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: On average, tocilizumab reduces all-cause mortality at D28 compared to standard care alone or placebo and probably results in slightly fewer serious adverse events than standard care alone or placebo. Nevertheless, tocilizumab probably results in little or no increase in the outcome clinical improvement (defined as hospital discharge or improvement measured by trialist-defined scales) at D28. The impact of tocilizumab on other outcomes is uncertain or very uncertain. With the data available, we were not able to explore heterogeneity. Individual patient data meta-analyses are needed to be able to identify which patients are more likely to benefit from this treatment. Evidence for an effect of sarilumab is uncertain and evidence for other anti-IL6 agents is unavailable. Thirty-nine RCTs of IL-6 blocking agents with no results are currently registered, of which nine are completed and seven trials were terminated with no results available. The findings of this review will be updated as new data are made available on the COVID-NMA platform (covid-nma.com).","Ghosn, Lina; Chaimani, Anna; Evrenoglou, Theodoros; Davidson, Mauricia; Graña, Carolina; Schmucker, Christine; Bollig, Claudia; Henschke, Nicholas; Sguassero, Yanina; Nejstgaard, Camilla Hansen; Menon, Sonia; Nguyen, Thu Van; Ferrand, Gabriel; Kapp, Philipp; Riveros, Carolina; Ávila, Camila; Devane, Declan; Meerpohl, Joerg J; Rada, Gabriel; Hróbjartsson, Asbjørn; Grasselli, Giacomo; Tovey, David; Ravaud, Philippe; Boutron, Isabelle",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,,394

407213,Using computerized maintenance management system (Cmms) in healthcare equipment maintenance operations,2020,"Health information technology (HIT) can enhance optimal health care access and utilization among individuals living with chronic diseases. This study aimed to provide population-level information on racial/ethnic disparities in HIT use and associated trends among those living with chronic diseases. The study sample consisted of adult respondents (&#8805;18 years) of the 2011-2018 National Health Interview Survey living with at least 1 chronic condition. Binomial regression was used to analyze the association between race/ethnicity, year, and 4 measures of HIT use for patient-provider interaction. Regression parameter estimates were used to predict the trends in probability of the outcome variables across race/ethnicity. About 73% of the study sample were non-Hispanic Whites, 15% were non-Hispanic Blacks, and 13% were Hispanics. Compared to non-Hispanic Whites, there were decreased adjusted odds of any HIT use among non-Hispanic Blacks (OR = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.67, 0.76) and Hispanics (OR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.72, 0.84). The likelihood of any HIT use increased with increasing year (OR: 1.16; 95% CI = 1.15, 1.18). Trends in racial/ethnic disparities were wider for email communication with provider and online prescription refill compared to online scheduling of appointment. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to accelerated adoption or expansion of HIT for patient care. Limited HIT use among non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics could worsen the disproportionate chronic disease burden, suboptimal clinical outcomes, and preventable health care costs experienced by this subpopulation. In conclusion, there is a need for intentional and strategic population-level interventions to increase HIT adoption and use among non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics living with chronic diseases.","Ojinnaka, Chinedum O; Adepoju, Omolola E",Popul. health manag.

407871,The Future of the World Wide Web: Wikipedia or Whatsapp?,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore how people with diabetes and diverse health literacy levels conceptualise their experience and efforts to engage in self-management behaviours (their self-management 'schemas'). DESIGN: A qualitative design was applied. METHODS: Twenty-six people in Sydney, Australia, took part in semi-structured interviews, which were audio-recorded and coded using Framework analysis. RESULTS: Half the participants (54%) had limited health literacy, whereas 38% adequate health literacy (using Newest Vital Sign). Regardless of health literacy, people described how monitoring increased self-management awareness and signalled periods of low self-management ('lulls'). Accounts of monitoring to sustain motivation were more apparent for participants with adequate health literacy. Most participants described simple and flexible rules (e.g. use artificial sweeteners; eat in moderation). Two schemas related to 'lulls': a 'problem-solving orientation' depicted lulls as inevitable and was associated with varied coping strategies; a 'willpower orientation' attributed lulls to lack of 'willpower,' and described willpower as a main coping strategy. CONCLUSION: There is considerable variation in how people think about their diabetes self-management and the strategies they use. Health literacy may contribute to some of this variation. Self-management interventions could benefit from depicting motivation as fluctuating and challenging ideas about willpower and self-blame.","Ayre, Julie; Bonner, Carissa; Muscat, Danielle M; Bramwell, Sian; McClelland, Sharon; Jayaballa, Rajini; Maberly, Glen; McCaffery, Kirsten",Psychol Health,,394

410173,Introduction: Self-Access and the Coronavirus Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Many arguments suggest that neutrophils could play a prominent role in COVID-19. However, the role of key components of neutrophil innate immunity in severe forms of COVID-19 has deserved insufficient attention. We aimed to evaluate the involvement of Neutrophil Elastase, histone-DNA, and DNases in systemic and multi-organ manifestations of COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a multicenter study of markers of neutrophil innate immunity in 155 cases consecutively recruited in a screening center, local hospitals, and two regional university hospitals. The cases were evaluated according to clinical and biological markers of severity and multi-organ manifestations and compared to 35 healthy controls. RESULTS: Blood Neutrophil Elastase, histone-DNA, myeloperoxidase-DNA and free dsDNA were dramatically increased, and DNase activity decreased by 10-fold, compared to controls. Neutrophil Elastase and histone-DNA were associated with intensive care admission, body temperature, lung damage and markers of cardiovascular outcomes, renal failure and increased interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8 and CXCR2. Neutrophil Elastase was an independent predictor of the computed tomography score of COVID-19 lung damage and the number of affected organs, in multivariate analyses. The increased blood concentrations of NE and neutrophil extracellular traps were related to exacerbation of neutrophil stimulation through IL8 and CXCR2 increased concentrations and increased serum DAMPs, and to impaired degradation of NETs as a consequence of the dramatic decrease of blood DNase activity. CONCLUSION: Our results point out the key role of neutrophil innate immunity exacerbation in COVID-19. Neutrophil Elastase and DNase could be potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets of severe systemic manifestations of COVID-19.","Guéant, Jean-Louis; Guéant-Rodriguez, Rosa-Maria; Fromonot, Julien; Oussalah, Abderrahim; Louis, Huguette; Chery, Celine; Gette, Mickael; Gleye, Stanislas; Callet, Jonas; Raso, Jeremie; Blanchecotte, François; Lacolley, Patrick; Guieu, Régis; Regnault, Véronique",Allergy,,394

The first relates to the psychological distress of members of the bereaved family who could not visit their loved ones who had COVID-19 before or after their death. The second relates to the bereavement experience of those who were unable to be with their loved ones when the end came, even though they did not have COVID-19, because of restrictions on visiting hospitals. We seek to focus on the need for a support system for bereaved families to help them through the grieving process, and discuss end-of-life care in such circumstances, and in the post-COVID-19 era, as in current day Japan.","Matsuda, Y.; Takebayashi, Y.; Nakajima, S.; Ito, M.",Frontiers in psychiatry Frontiers Research Foundation,,394

In this issue of the JCI, Qin, Wu, and Chen et al. focused specifically on people whose acute infection lacked obvious neurological involvement. Severely infected patients showed abnormal gray matter volumes, white matter diffusion, and cerebral blood flow compared with healthy controls and those with mild infection. The data remain associative rather than mechanistic, but correlations with systemic immune markers suggest effects of inflammation, hypercoagulation, or other aspects of disease severity. Mechanistic research is warranted. Given the lack of obvious neurological symptoms, neurocognitive assessments were not performed, but the findings suggest that such assessments may be warranted in severely affected patients, even without obvious symptoms. Further, studying CNS involvement of other disorders with overlapping pathophysiologies such as inflammation, coagulation, hypoxia, or direct viral infection may reveal the causes for COVID-19-related neuropathology.","Mahajan, Amit; Mason, Graeme F",J. clin. invest,,394

METHODS: We prospectively followed 29 coronavirus disease 2019 cases, mean age 44â¯± 13.2 years. Except for one participant with a pre-existing diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, all other participants were previously healthy. We determined anti-viral binding antibodies at 2-10 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after disease onset as well as neutralizing antibodies at 6 months. Two binding antibody assays were used, targeting the S1 subunit of the spike protein, and the receptor binding domain. RESULTS: All participants fully recovered spontaneously except for one who had persisting hyposmia. Antibodies to the receptor binding domain persisted for 6 months in all cases with a slight increase of titers, whereas antibodies to S1 dropped below the cut-off point in 2 participants and showed a minimal decrease on average, mainly at month 3 of follow-up in males; however, neutralizing antibodies were detected in all samples at 6 months of follow-up. CONCLUSION: There is a stable and persisting antibody response against acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at 6 months after infection. Neutralizing antibodies confirm virus specificity. As the number of coronavirus disease 2019 convalescent cases is increasing sharply, antibody testing should be implemented to identify immunized individuals. This information can be helpful in various settings of professional and private life.","Deisenhammer, Florian; Borena, Wegene; Bauer, Angelika; Kimpel, Janine; Rudzki, Dagmar; Schanda, Kathrin; Egeter, Jonas; Hüfner, Katharina; Sperner-Unterweger, Barbara; Reindl, Markus",Wien. klin.

414446,"The Impact of Covid-19 on Organizational Culture, Communication and Conflict Management",2020,"BACKGROUND: Transparent and accessible reporting of COVID-19 data is critical for public health efforts. Each Indian state has its own mechanism for reporting COVID-19 data, and the quality of their reporting has not been systematically evaluated. We present a comprehensive assessment of the quality of COVID-19 data reporting done by the Indian state governments between 19 May and 1 June, 2020. METHODS: We designed a semi-quantitative framework with 45 indicators to assess the quality of COVID-19 data reporting. The framework captures four key aspects of public health data reporting - availability, accessibility, granularity, and privacy. We used this framework to calculate a COVID-19 Data Reporting Score (CDRS, ranging from 0-1) for each state. RESULTS: Our results indicate a large disparity in the quality of COVID-19 data reporting across India. CDRS varies from 0.61 (good) in Karnataka to 0.0 (poor) in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, with a median value of 0.26. Ten states do not report data stratified by age, gender, comorbidities or districts. Only ten states provide trend graphics for COVID-19 data. In addition, we identify that Punjab and Chandigarh compromised the privacy of individuals under quarantine by publicly releasing their personally identifiable information. The CDRS is positively associated with the state's sustainable development index for good health and well-being (Pearson correlation: r=0.630,p=0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: Our assessment informs the public health efforts in India and serves as a guideline for pandemic data reporting. The disparity in CDRS highlights three important findings at the national, state, and individual level. At the national level, it shows the lack of a unified framework for reporting COVID-19 data in India, and highlights the need for a central agency to monitor or audit the quality of data reporting done by the states. Without a unified framework, it is difficult to aggregate the data from different states, gain insights, and coordinate an effective nationwide response to the pandemic. Moreover, it reflects the inadequacy in coordination or sharing of resources among the states. The disparate reporting score also reflects inequality in individual access to public health information and privacy protection based on the state of residence.","Vasudevan, Varun; Gnanasekaran, Abeynaya; Sankar, Varsha; Vasudevan, Siddarth A; Zou, James",BMC Public Health,,394
414447,"The Impact of Covid-19 on Organizational Culture, Communication and Conflict Management",2020,"The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is a significant psychological stressor in addition to its tremendous impact on every facet of individuals' lives and organizations in virtually all social and economic sectors worldwide. Fear of illness and uncertainty about the future precipitate anxiety- and stress-related disorders, and several groups have rightfully called for the creation and dissemination of robust mental health screening and treatment programs for the general public and front-line healthcare workers. However, in addition to pandemic-associated psychological distress, the direct effects of the virus itself (several acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2), and the subsequent host immunologic response, on the human central nervous system (CNS) and related outcomes are unknown. We discuss currently available evidence of COVID-19 related neuropsychiatric sequelae while drawing parallels to past viral pandemic-related outcomes. Past pandemics have demonstrated that diverse types of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as encephalopathy, mood changes, psychosis, neuromuscular dysfunction, or demyelinating processes, may accompany acute viral infection, or may follow infection by weeks, months, or longer in recovered patients. The potential mechanisms are also discussed, including viral and immunological underpinnings. Therefore, prospective neuropsychiatric monitoring of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 at various points in the life course, as well as their neuroimmune status, are needed to fully understand the long-term impact of COVID-19, and to establish a framework for integrating psychoneuroimmunology into epidemiologic studies of pandemics.","Troyer, Emily A; Kohn, Jordan N; Hong, Suzi",Brain Behav Immun,,394

415955,Foundation and medical training posts will rotate in August,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 crisis has created unanticipated changes in health care delivery for people living with multiple sclerosis (MS). The pandemic's rapid evolution has resulted in a knowledge gap in how COVID-19 has affected MS clinical practice. Our objective was to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected clinical practice patterns in a nationwide cohort of MS clinicians across the United States. METHODS: In collaboration with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS), we developed a 28-item SurveyMonkeyTM electronic questionnaire exploring MS specialists' perceptions of how COVID-19 has altered how they prescribe MS disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), provide telehealth and other services, and view issues affecting their own well-being including re-deployment to the front lines of COVID-19 care and availability of personal protective equipment (PPE). NMSS staff sent a recruitment email containing the electronic survey link to 188 clinicians who serve on regional NMSS Healthcare Provider Councils across the US, 86 (45.7%) of whom were MS specialist physicians. RESULTS: Eighty-six of 188 potential respondents (45.7%) from 32 US states completed the survey including 45 physicians (41 neurologists, 3 physiatrists and 1 family physician), 18 rehabilitation therapists, 7 psychologists, 6 nurse practitioners, 4 social workers, 2 physician assistants, 2 nurses and 2 health professionals from other disciplines. More than 80% of all respondents working on-site in a health care setting believed they had adequate PPE. More than 41% were able to distance safely from others at work. Nearly 10% of respondents reported they had been re-deployed to the front lines of COVID-19 patient care, and an additional 16.9% anticipated being re-deployed. Among the MS specialist physician subgroup, nearly one-third reported using telemedicine to provide over 75% of their clinical care. Only 16.7% believed COVID-19 had not changed how they prescribe DMTs. Therapies prescribed more often during the pandemic included ß-IFNs (28.6% of prescribers), natalizumab (23.8%), glatiramer acetate (21.4%) and teriflunomide (19%). DMTs prescribed less often included alemtuzumab (64.3% of prescribers), cladribine (54.8%), ocrelizumab and rituximab (50%), and fingolimod and siponimod (40.5%). For at least some of their patients during the pandemic, some MS specialists reported suspending certain DMTs including alemtuzumab (21.4% of prescribers), ocrelizumab and rituximab (16.7%) and cladribine (11.9%). Others reported extending DMT dosing intervals for natalizumab (38.1%), fingolimod and siponimod (11.9%). CONCLUSIONS: In this nationwide survey, MS specialist physicians and other clinicians serving on regional NMSS Healthcare Provider Councils across the US reported profound changes in how they are delivering MS care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Morrison, Elizabeth H; Michtich, Katelyn; Hersh, Carrie M",Mult Scler Relat Disord,,394

Assuming skill acquisition is the target of training, programs should include time and space for repeated practice opportunities structured through evidence-based learning theories (Amodeo et al. in Adm Soc Work 33:423-438, 2009). Essential learning attributes derived from Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller in Cognit Sci 12:257-285, 1988) and the Theory of Deliberate Practice (Ericsson et al. in Psychol Rev 100:363-406, 1993) can effectively integrate into virtual simulations intended to build expertise. Virtual Home Simulation (VHS) and Virtual Motivational Interviewing (VMI) are presented in this paper as an approach to develop virtual simulations that provide child welfare workers a means to deliberately practice essential skills toward competence before entering the workforce.

METHODS: In October 2020, we searched the databases Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase and Web of Science, using a pre-defined search strategy. RESULTS: The literature search yielded an initial list of 2172 records. After screening of titles and abstracts, followed by full-text screening, 51 articles were retained and included in the analysis. All of them referred to the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The direct health impact that was covered in the greatest number (25) of SR related to mental health, followed by 13 SR on healthcare delivery and 12 on infection control. The predominant areas of indirect health impacts covered by the included studies relate to the economic and social impacts. Only three articles mentioned the negative impact on education. CONCLUSIONS: The focus of SR so far has been uneven, with mental health receiving the most attention.

420462,101 MPs urge Chancellor to throw dentists a lifeline,2020,"Genomic techniques such as next-generation sequencing and microarrays have facilitated the identification and classification of molecular signatures inherent in cells upon viral infection, for possible therapeutic targets. Therefore, in this study, we performed a differential gene expression analysis, pathway enrichment analysis, and gene ontology on RNAseq data obtained from SARS-CoV-2 infected A549 cells. Differential expression analysis revealed that 753 genes were up-regulated while 746 down-regulated. SNORA81, OAS2, SYCP2, LOC100506985, and SNORD35B are the top 5 upregulated genes upon SARS-Cov-2 infection. Expectedly, these genes have been implicated in the immune response to viral assaults. In the Ontology of protein classification, a high percentage of the genes are classified as Gene-specific transcriptional regulator, metabolite interconversion enzyme, and Protein modifying enzymes. Twenty pathways with P-value lower than 0.05 were enriched in the up-regulated genes while 18 pathways are enriched in the down-regulated DEGs. The toll-like receptor signalling pathway is one of the major pathways enriched. This pathway plays an important role in the innate immune system by identifying the pathogen-associated molecular signature emanating from various microorganisms. Taken together, our results present a novel understanding of genes and corresponding pathways upon SARS-Cov-2 infection, and could facilitate the identification of novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers in the treatment of COVID-19.","Soremekun, Opeyemi S.; Omolabi, Kehinde F.; Soliman, Mahmoud E.S.",Inform.

420713,Analysis and trends in the development of the fashion industry goods during the coronavirus pandemic using methods of mathematical statistics,2021,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter drives various gene expression and yields sufficient protein for further functional investigation. Receptor binding domain (RBD) on spike protein of the SARS_CoV2 is the most critical portal for virus infection. Thus native conformational RBD protein may facilitate biochemical identification of RBD and provide valuable support of drug and vaccine design for curing COVID-19. We attempted to express RBD under CMV promoter in vitro, but failed. RBD-specific mRNA cannot be detected in cell transfected with recombinant plasmids, in which CMV promoter governs the RBD transcription. Additionally, the pCMV-Tag2B-SARS_CoV2_RBD trans-inactivates CMV promoter transcription activity. Alternatively, we identified that both Chicken ß-actin promoter and Vaccinia virus-specific medium/late (M/L) promoter (pSYN) can highly precede SARS_CoV2 RBD expression. Our findings provided evidence that SARS_CoV2 RBD gene can be driven by Chicken ß-actin promoter or Vaccinia virus-specific medium/late promoter instead of CMV promoter, thus providing valuable information for RBD feature exploration.","Xie, Lilan; Yi, Kai; Li, Yaoming",Virology,,394

Even though diagnostic tools based on RT-PCR are being extensively employed at present, well-timed and precise diagnostics are still restricted because of the long-period and exhaustive man-power requirement. To tackle this problem, we herewith report the fabrication of the surface functionalised magnetic nanoparticles (MNP’s) and viral RNA-extraction protocol for potential detection of COVID-19. The zinc ferrite nanoparticles were prepared by combustion synthesis and its surface was functionalised by silica and carboxyl-modified polyvinyl alcohol. The MNP’s were characterized to confirm the nano-scale appearance and functionalization. The proposed model may provide the ability to extract the viral RNA from several specimens through automation process. In light of ease and proficiency, this protocol may significantly lessen the operation period and necessities for the present molecular-level diagnostic of COVID-19.","B. Somvanshi, Sandeep; B.

A mathematical model considering young and elder subpopulations under different fatality rates was formulated based on the natural history of CoViD-19 to study the transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The model considered susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, mild CoViD-19, severe CoViD-19, and recovered compartments, besides compartments of isolated individuals and those who were caught by test. This model was applied to study the epidemiological scenario resulting from the adoption of quarantine (isolation or lockdown) in many countries to control the rapid propagation of CoViD-19. We chose as examples the isolation adopted in São Paulo State (Brazil) in the early phase but not at the beginning of the epidemic, and the lockdown implemented in Spain when the number of severe CoViD-19 cases was increasing rapidly. Based on the data collected from São Paulo State and Spain, the model parameters were evaluated, and we obtained a higher estimation for the basic reproduction number R0 (9.24 for São Paulo State, and 8 for Spain) compared to the currently accepted estimation of R0 around 2 using the SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered compartments) model. In comparison with the lockdown in Spain, the relatively early adoption of the isolation in São Paulo State resulted in enlarging the period of the first wave of the epidemic and delaying its peak. The model allowed to explain the flattening of the epidemic curves by quarantine when associated with the protective measures (face mask, washing hands with alcohol and gel, and social distancing) adopted by the population. The description of the epidemic under quarantine and protections can be a background to foreseen the epidemiological scenarios from the release strategies, which can help guide public health policies by decision-makers.","Yang, Hyun Mo; Lombardi Junior, Luis Pedro; Castro, Fábio Fernandes Morato; Yang, Ariana Campos",PLoS One,,394
423439,Whatever it Takes: A Rapid and Massive Increase in Aid is Needed to Save Millions of Lives and Bring Our Divided World Together Amid the Coronavirus Pandemic,2020,"The novel coronavirus has upended many traditional research procedures as universities and other research entities have closed to activate social distancing. Some social and behavioral research activities (e.g. data analysis, manuscript preparation) can be continued from other environments with appropriate security protocols in place. For studies involving in-person interactions, continuity may be more difficult. Phone-based interactions provide a low-tech solution that may suffice in some cases. Yet, videoconferencing platforms can nearly replicate in-person interactions, activating both auditory and visual senses and potentially resulting in more substantial engagement. Staff can meet with participants individually or in groups, each seeing and hearing one another in real time. This paper provides guidance for researchers transitioning in-person assessments and interventions to a synchronous videoconferencing platform. Best practices, key considerations, examples from the field, and sample protocols are presented to ease transition for ongoing studies and maximize the potential of videoconferencing-and social distancing.","Marhefka, Stephanie; Lockhart, Elizabeth; Turner, DeAnne",AIDS Behav,,394

METHODS: Serum samples from 30 patients were assayed for anti-NP responses, for 'neutralisation' by the surrogate neutralisation assay and for neutralisation by SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped virus assays utilising two target cell lines. Correlation between assays was measured using linear regression. RESULTS: The responses observed within the surrogate neutralisation assay demonstrated an extremely strong, highly significant positive correlation with those observed in both pseudotyped virus assays. CONCLUSIONS: The tested ELISA-based surrogate assay provides an immunologically useful measure of functional immune responses in a much quicker and highly automatable fashion. It also reinforces that detection of anti-RBD neutralising antibodies alone is a powerful measure of the capacity to neutralise viral infection.","Murray, Matthew J; McIntosh, Megan; Atkinson, Claire; Mahungu, Tabitha; Wright, Edward; Chatterton, Wendy; Gandy, Michael; Reeves, Matthew B",J Infect,,394

This can be achieved with simplified testing approaches and affordable access to core resources. While RT-qPCR-based tests remain the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection due to their high sensitivity, implementation of testing requires high upfront costs to obtain the necessary instrumentation. This is particularly restrictive in low-resource settings. The Ubiquitome Liberty16 system was developed as an inexpensive, portable, battery-operated single-channel RT-qPCR device with an associated iPhone app to simplify assay set-up and data reporting. When coupled with the SalivaDirect protocol for testing saliva samples for SARS-CoV-2, the Liberty16 device yielded a limit of detection (LOD) of 12 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/{micro}L, comparable to the upper end of the LOD range for the standard SalivaDirect protocol when performed on larger RT-qPCR instruments. While further optimization may deliver even greater sensitivity and assay speed, findings from this study indicate that small portable devices such as the Liberty16 can deliver reliable results and provide the opportunity to further increase access to gold standard SARS-CoV-2 testing.","Yolda-Carr, Devyn; Thammavongsa, Darani A; Vega, Noel; Turner, Susan J; Pickering, Paul J; Wyllie, Anne L",,,394

Guidelines have delineated how best to diagnose and manage patients with PE. However, the unique aspects of COVID-19 confound both the diagnosis and treatment of PE, and therefore require modification of established algorithms. Important considerations include adjustment of diagnostic modalities, incorporation of the prothrombotic contribution of COVID-19, management of two critical cardiorespiratory illnesses in the same patient, and protecting patients and health-care workers while providing optimal care. The benefits of a team-based approach for decision-making and coordination of care, such as that offered by pulmonary embolism response teams (PERTs), have become more evident in this crisis. The importance of careful follow-up care also is underscored for patients with these two diseases with long-term effects.

Methods: We performed a retrospective review of all patients seen at three radiation oncology departments within the ""XXXX"" Health system in ""XXXX"" during the initial COVID-19 surge. Primary end points were to define and quantify COVID-related, radiation-specific care changes, and to identify predictive factors of experiencing COVID-related care changes. Results: 545 cancer patients were seen during the study period, 99 of whom (18.1%) experienced >1 COVID-related care change. Radiation treatment (RT) delays were most common, accounting for 51.5% of all care changes. Physician-directed delays accounted for 41.2% of RT delays, while patient fears, COVID testing, and access barriers were responsible for 27.5%, 17.6%, and 13.7%, respectively. Patient age (p=0.040), intent of treatment (p=0.047), and cancer type (p<0.001) were significantly associated with experiencing a COVID-related care change, as we found that older, curative intent, and rectal cancer patients were more likely to experience care changes. On multivariate analysis, patient age remained significant when controlling for treatment intent and cancer type. Conclusion: Our study provides a perspective on how care was adapted to protect cancer patients during a pandemic while maximizing disease control. The positive correlation between age and likelihood of care changes may reflect extra precaution taken with older patients given their vulnerability to severe COVID illness; while the lower observed likelihood of COVID-related care changes among patients undergoing palliative RT may reflect either the more urgent needs addressed by palliative RT or may simply be logistical, as palliative radiation is often delivered in short courses with less exposure risk. It will be crucial to assess adaptations others have implemented and monitor how they impact patient outcomes.","Pendyala, Praveen; Goglia, Alexander G; Mattes, Malcolm D; Grann, Alison; Huang, David; Wagman, Raquel T; Yehia, Zeinab Abou; Yoon, Jennifer; Ennis, Ronald D",Adv Radiat Oncol,,394

This paper highlights the potential of azithromycin and ambroxol to treat COVID-19. Azithromycin and ambroxol share lysosomotropic characteristics, i.e. they penetrate and accumulate inside the late endosomes and lysosomes and may possibly interfere with multiplication of the virus inside cells. In addition, both of these drugs have anti-inflammatory effects. Ambroxol has a proven antiviral effect and a unique stimulatory action on the secretion of surfactant by alveolar type II cells, the main target of SARS-CoV-2. Surfactant may form a fundamental defence mechanism against the virus. Involvement of nasal epithelial cells in SARS-CoV-2 entry suggested advantageous use of inhaled drug delivery of these two drugs over the use of systemic administration. Inhaled drug delivery could aid in targeting the drug to the exact site of action with little or no side effects. To conclude, administration of these two drugs using a special drug delivery system provides two kinds of drug targeting: (i) tissue targeting through using an inhaled drug delivery system to achieve high drug concentrations at the respiratory epithelial tissue that overexpress the ACE2 receptor for virus binding; and (ii) cellular targeting of the virus in the acidic vesicles (late endosomes and lysosomes), which represent the fate of endocytic viruses.","Alkotaji, Myasar",Int J Antimicrob Agents,,394

In this study, we elucidate whether severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) stimulates autoantibody production and contributes to autoimmunity activation. We enrolled 40 adult patients (66.8 years mean age) admitted to Alessandria hospital between March and April 2020. All the patients had a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and no previously clinical record of autoimmune disease. 40 blood donors were analyzed for the same markers and considered as healthy controls. Our patients had high levels of common inflammatory markers, such as C Reactive Protein, Lactate Dehydrogenase, ferritin and creatinine. Interleukin-6 concentrations were also increased, supporting the major role of this interleukin during COVID-19 infection. Lymphocytes number were generally lower compared to healthy individuals. All the patients were also screened for the most common autoantibodies. We found a significant prevalence of ANA, ANCA and ASCA IgA antibodies. We observed that patients having a de novo autoimmune response had the worst acute viral disease prognosis and outcome. Our results sustain the hypothesis that COVID-19 infection correlates with the autoimmunity markers. Our study might help clinicians to: a) better understand the heterogeneity of this pathology and b) correctly evaluate COVID-19 clinical manifestations. Our data explained why drugs used to treat autoimmune diseases may also be useful for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

With increasing morbidity and mortality, the need for novel drug candidates is under great demand. The investigations are progressing towards COVID-19 therapeutics. Among the various strategies employed, the use of repurposed drugs is competing along with novel drug inventions. Based on the therapeutic significance, the chemical constituents from the extract of Tinospora cordifolia belonging to various classes like alkaloids, lignans, steroids and terpenoids are investigated as potential drug candidates for COVID-19. The inhibition potential of the proposed compounds against viral spike protein and human receptor ACE2 were evaluated by computational molecular modeling (Auto dock), along with their ADME/T properties. Prior to docking, the initial geometry of the compounds were optimized by Density functional theory (DFT) method employing B3LYP hybrid functional and 6-311 + + G (d,p) basis set. The results of molecular docking and ADME/T studies have revealed 6 constituents as potential drug candidates that can inhibit the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with the human receptor ACE2 protein.

Confirmed patients with COVID-19 undergoing maintenance hemodialysis in the blood purification center were recruited. The general data of patients, including age, sex, duration of dialysis, and basic diseases, were analyzed. The clinical features included fever, respiratory symptoms, and gastrointestinal symptoms. The items for laboratory tests included blood routine examination, liver function, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, creatine kinase, creatine kinase-MB, markers of myocardial injury, B-type natriuretic peptide, D-dimer, and so forth. The imaging examinations referred mainly to computed tomography imaging findings of the lungs.Twenty-one cases were complicated with chronic basic diseases, such as hypertension or diabetes. In terms of clinical manifestations, 13 cases had fever, which was close to the number of cases without fever (13 cases). The respiratory symptoms included dry cough (19 cases), shortness of breath (9 cases), fatigue (11 cases), and so forth. Further, 15 patients had hypoxemia, indicating more severe patients. Sore throat (2 cases) was not significant, and a few patients reported gastrointestinal symptoms (3 cases). The results of blood routine examination showed decreased absolute lymphocyte count (0.7â±â0.4â×â10â¼9/L), lower hemoglobin level (105.2â±â20âg/L), and normal absolute neutrophil count 4.2 (3.0, 5.9)â×â10â¼9/L. Of the inflammatory indexes, procalcitonin was 0.69 (0.24, 2.73) ng/mL; C reactive protein was 17.2 (5.2, 181.6) mg/L, which was higher than normal. Blood biochemistry revealed lower albumin level (38.0â±â4.0âg/L) and higher troponin 0.11(0.035, 6.658) ng/mL and myoglobin levels (538.5â±â240.5âng/mL), suggesting myocardial injury.The patients with uremia and confirmed COVID-19 undergoing maintenance hemodialysis are more common in males. Although the proportion of fever patients is 50%, the proportion of hypoxemia patients is high (58%). With poor cardiac function. They were prone to respiratory failure complicated with heart failure. According to the onset characteristics of this population, early diagnosis and treatment could help reduce the risk of developing a critical illness and control the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic.","Wang, You; Hu, Manli; Ye, Gang; Zhao, Yuanyuan; Yin, Qingqiao; Pi, Pei; Luo, Dan",Medicine (Baltimore),,394
435817,Detecting Treatment Effect Modifiers in Social Networks,2021-05-21,"Abstract-This study aims to investigate the challenges that learners and teachers of a language face during distance learning classes, especially learners and teachers of the Arabic language as a second language, based on the results of a distance learning experiment on non-native speakers of the Arabic language at the University of Jordan during the second term of 2019-2020. The study seeks to introduce the proper solutions that may mitigate these challenges to achieve the educational goals through distance learning while teaching the Arabic language as a second language. This study used the applied descriptive approach in identifying these challenges. It concluded that these challenges significantly impact the language learning process, including mastering it, the extent of benefit, and the influence on students' linguistic progress. This study recommends that these challenges are considered when adopting distance learning as a language education method at teaching language classes as a second one. These challenges need to be considered when planning for direct and indirect lessons in Arabic language educational classes, primarily via the Internet.","Al-Assaf, Dalal Moh039",Journal of Language Teaching and Research,,394

We show here that among all viral proteins, Nsp1 has the largest impact on host viability in the cells of human lung origin. Differential expression analysis of mRNA-seq data revealed that Nsp1 broadly alters the cellular transcriptome. Our cryo-EM structure of the Nsp1-40S ribosome complex shows that Nsp1 inhibits translation by plugging the mRNA entry channel of the 40S. We also determined the structure of the 48S preinitiation complex formed by Nsp1, 40S, and the cricket paralysis virus internal ribosome entry site (IRES) RNA, which shows that it is nonfunctional because of the incorrect position of the mRNA 3' region. Our results elucidate the mechanism of host translation inhibition by SARS-CoV-2 and advance understanding of the impacts from a major pathogenicity factor of SARS-CoV-2.","Yuan, Shuai; Peng, Lei; Park, Jonathan J; Hu, Yingxia; Devarkar, Swapnil C; Dong, Matthew B; Shen, Qi; Wu, Shenping; Chen, Sidi; Lomakin, Ivan B; Xiong, Yong",Mol. cell,,394
436914,Comparative analysis of machine learning-based classification models using sentiment classification of tweets related to COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Despite being associated with worse prognosis in patients with COVID-19, systematic determination of myocardial injury is not recommended. The aim of the study was to study the effect of myocardial injury assessment on risk stratification of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Seven hundred seven consecutive adult patients admitted to a large tertiary hospital with confirmed COVID-19 were included. Demographic data, comorbidities, laboratory results and clinical outcomes were recorded. Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was calculated in order to quantify the degree of comorbidities. Independent association of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) increase with outcomes was evaluated by multivariate regression analyses and area under curve. In addition, propensity-score matching was performed to assemble a cohort of patients with similar baseline characteristics. RESULTS: In the matched cohort (mean age 66.76 ± 15.7 years, 37.3% females), cTnI increase above the upper limit was present in 20.9% of the population and was associated with worse clinical outcomes, including all-cause mortality within 30 days (45.1% vs. 23.2%; p = 0.005). The addition of cTnI to a multivariate prediction model showed a significant improvement in the area under the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve (0.775 vs. 0.756, &#916;C-statistic = 0.019; 95% CI 0.001-0.037). Use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors was not associated with mortality after adjusting by baseline risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial injury is independently associated with adverse outcomes irrespective of baseline comorbidities and its addition to multivariate regression models significantly improves their performance in predicting mortality. The determination of myocardial injury biomarkers on hospital admission and its combination with CCI can classify patients in three risk groups (high, intermediate and low) with a clearly distinct 30-day mortality.","Lorente-Ros, Alvaro; Monteagudo Ruiz, Juan Manuel; Rincón, Luis M; Ortega Pérez, Rodrigo; Rivas, Sonia; Martínez-Moya, Rafael; Sanromán, Maria Ascensión; Manzano, Luis; Alonso, Gonzalo Luis; Ibáñez, Borja; Zamorano, Jose Luis",Cardiol j (Print),,394
438104,Academic conferencing in 2020: A virtual conference model,2020,"The tachykinin NK2 receptor plays a key role in gastrointestinal motor function. Enteric neurons release neurokinin A (NKA) which activates NK2 receptors on gastrointestinal smooth muscle, leading to contraction and increased motility. In patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, the NK2 receptor antagonist ibodutant had a greater therapeutic effect in females than males. The present study aimed to determine whether gender influences the expression and activity of NK2 receptors in human colonic smooth muscle. In vitro functional studies were performed to examine the contractile responses of colonic muscle strips to NKA and the selective NK2 receptor agonist [Lys5,MeLeu9,Nle10]NKA(4-10). Contractions were also measured in the presence of ibodutant to determine its antagonistic potency. The signal transduction pathways coupled to NK2 receptor activation were investigated using second messenger inhibitors. Western blot and fluorescent immunohistochemistry were conducted to determine the protein expression and localization of NK2 receptors. NK2 receptor-mediated contractility was greater in females compared to males. When against NKA, ibodutant was more potent in females. NK2 receptor expression increased with age in females, but not in males. Phospholipase C-mediated signalling was less prominent in females compared to males, while Ca2+ sensitization via Rho kinase and protein kinase C appeared to be the dominant pathway in both genders. The distribution of NK2 receptors in the human colon did not differ between the genders. Overall, gender differences exist in the expression and activity of NK2 receptors in colonic smooth muscle. These gender distinctions should be considered in the therapeutic development of NK2 receptor agents. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The tachykinin NK2 receptor has been identified as a therapeutic target for the treatment of bowel and bladder dysfunctions. The present study has revealed gender-related variations in NK2 receptor activity, signalling transduction pathways, antagonist potency and changes in expression with age. These factors may underlie the gender differences in the treatment of diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome with NK2 receptor antagonists. Our findings highlight that gender differences should be considered in the therapeutic development of NK2 receptor agents.","Drimousis, Stelina; Markus, Irit; Murphy, Timothy V; Perera, D Shevy; Phan-Thien, Kim-Chi; Zhang, Li; Liu, Lu",J. pharmacol. exp. ther,,394
438333,Assistance from the Intelligence Community in the Fight Against the Corona Pandemic,2020,"A delay in receiving an antipsychotic treatment is associated with unfavourable clinical and functional outcomes in patients with a first episode of psychosis. In recent years, early psychosis intervention programmes have been implemented that seek the early detection and treatment of patients who begin to describe psychotic symptoms. These programmes have shown to be more effective than standard care in improving the symptoms of the disorder and recovering the patient's functionality, in turn proving to be more cost-effective. The benefits of these programmes have led to their implementation in high-income countries. However, implementation in medium- and low-income countries has been slower. Peru, a Latin American country with an upper middle income, is undergoing a mental health reform that prioritises health care based on the prevention, treatment and psychosocial recovery of patients from a comprehensive and community approach. The present manuscript describes the characteristics and structure of the pioneering and more developed programmes for early psychosis intervention, and discusses the benefits and challenges of implementing an early psychosis intervention programme in Peru in the current context of mental health reform.","Valle, Rubén",Rev Colomb Psiquiatr,,394

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in the Nabdam district, Ghana. Data were collected from 527 pregnant women randomly selected from antenatal care clinics from 16 healthcare facilities. Descriptive statistics were used to assess the prevalence of adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the factors associated with COVID-19 preventive measures, whilst adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: The prevalence of wearing a face mask 18.0% (95% CI: 14.73%, 21.32%); of handwashing/hand sanitising 31.7% (95% CI: 27.70%, 35.67%), and of social distancing, 22.0% (95% CI: 18.46%, 25.56%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms [Adjusted odds ratios (aOR): 2.86, 95% CI: 1.03, 7.89] and knowledge of COVID-19 transmission via contaminated surfaces/objects (aOR: 4.60, 95% CI: 1.23, 17.18) were associated with wearing a face mask. Pregnant women who knew that avoiding the touching of eyes, nose and mouth can prevent COVID-19 (aOR: 2.71, 95% CI: 1.01, 7.28), and knowledge of the virus being transmitted via contaminated objects/surfaces (aOR: 4.08, 95% CI: 1.42, 11.76), were associated with handwashing/hand sanitising. Knowledge of COVID-19 transmission via contaminated surfaces/objects (aOR: 15.27, 95% CI: 1.87, 124.43) was also associated with social distancing.

441352,"Interactive Network Visualization of Opioid Crisis Related Data- Policy, Pharmaceutical, Training, and More",2021-02-10,"AIM: The recent availability of vaccines against COVID-19 has sparked national and international debate on the feasibility of administering them to pregnant and lactating women, given that these vaccines have not been tested to assess their safety and efficacy in such women. As concerns the risks of COVID-induced disease, published data show that pregnant women who develop COVID-19 have fewer symptoms than patients who are not pregnant, but they are more likely to need hospitalization in intensive care, and neonatal morbidity. Aim of the present perspective paper is to analyze the current literature regarding the use of the vaccine against COVID-19 infection, in terms of safety and protection, in high risk pregnant women as those affected by diabetes and obesity. METHODS: Analysis of literature about vaccination against COVID-19 infection in pregnancy. RESULTS: The main health organizations and international scientific societies, emphasize that-although data regarding the use of COVID vaccines during pregnancy and lactation are still lacking-vaccination should not be contraindicated. It should be considered for pregnant women at high risk of exposure to COVID-19. For such women, the potential benefits and risks should be assessed by the healthcare professionals caring for them. A recent prospective study to test the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of vaccination with COVID-19 mRNA in pregnant and lactating women, has showed that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination triggers a robust humoral immunity in pregnant and lactating women; there was also evidence of an immune transfer to their newborn. CONCLUSIONS: We urgently need data on the effect of COVID-19 vaccination, in terms of maternal and fetal outcomes and vaccine related symptoms in high risk women during pregnancy and breastfeeding. It is important to run campaigns to promote vaccination, in particular in pregnant women at high risk to have severe COVID infection as those diabetics and/or obese.","Lapolla, A; Dalfrà, M G; Burlina, S",Acta diabetol,,394

Furthermore, the timing and magnitude of sCoV outbreaks did not occur concurrently, and coinfections were not reported. With respect to other cocirculating respiratory viruses, we found evidence of positive, rather than negative, interactions with sCoVs. These findings highlight the importance of considering cocirculating viruses in the differential diagnosis of COVID-19.

441629,A Decentralized Electronic Prescription Management System,2021-09-12,"PURPOSE: Reducing the spread of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic prompted recommendations for individuals to socially distance. Little is known about the extent to which youth are socially distancing, what motivations underlie their social distancing, and how these motivations are connected with amount of social distancing, mental health, and social health. Using a large sample of adolescents from across the United States, this study examined adolescents' motivations for social distancing, their engagement in social distancing, and their mental and social health. METHODS: Data were collected on March 29th and 30th, 2020, two weeks after COVID-19 was declared a national emergency in the United States. The sample consisted of 683 adolescents recruited using social media. A series of multiple linear regressions examined unique associations among adolescents' motivations to engage in social distancing, perceived amount of social distancing, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness. RESULTS: Almost all respondents (98.1%) reported engaging in at least a little social distancing. The most commonly reported motivations for social distancing concerned social responsibility and not wanting others to get sick. Motivations concerning state or city lockdowns, parental rules, and social responsibility were associated with greater social distancing, whereas motivations concerning no alternatives were associated with less social distancing. Specific motivations for social distancing were differentially associated with adolescents' anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding adolescents' motivations to engage in social distancing may inform strategies to increase social distancing engagement, reduce pathogen transmission, and identify individual differences in mental and social health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Oosterhoff, Benjamin; Palmer, Cara A; Wilson, Jenna; Shook, Natalie",J Adolesc Health,,394

The WHO recognized the spread of COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Based on statistics from 10 August 2020, more than 20.2 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported resulting in more than 738,000 deaths. This completely new coronavirus has spread worldwide in a short period, causing economic crises and healthcare system failures worldwide. Initially, it was thought that the main health threat was associated with respiratory system failures, but since then, SARS-CoV-2 has been linked to a broad spectrum of symptoms indicating neurological manifestations, including ischemic stroke. Current knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 and its complications is very limited because of its rapidly evolving character. However, further research is undoubtedly necessary to understand the causes of neurological abnormalities, including acute cerebrovascular disease. The viral infection is inextricably associated with the activation of the immune system and the release of pro-inflammatory factors, that can stimulate the host organism to defend itself. However, the body's immune response is a double-edged sword that on one hand, destroys the virus but also disrupts the homeostasis leading to serious complications, including thrombosis. Numerous studies have linked coagulopathies with COVID-19, however, there is great uncertainty regarding it functions on the molecular level. In this review, a detailed insight into the biological processes associated with ischemic stroke in COVID-19 patients and suggest a possible explanation for this phenomenon is provided.","Szelenberger, Rafal; Saluk-Bijak, Joanna; Bijak, Michal",,,394

We investigated the association of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitor use with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes in hypertensive patients. Methods: We identified hypertensive patients with confirmed COVID-19 from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service from inception to May 15, 2020. The primary outcome was the composite of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and death from COVID-19. The individual components were evaluated as secondary outcomes. Results: Of 1,374 hypertensive patients with COVID-19, 1,076 (78.3%) and 298 (21.7%) were users and never-users of RAAS inhibitors, respectively. The RAAS inhibitor users were not associated with the risk of the primary outcome (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46 to 1.10). The risk of ICU admission was significantly lower in the users than the never-users (aOR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.84). The RAAS inhibitors were beneficial only in ICU admissions that did not require IMV (aOR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.58). The risk of death from COVID-19 was comparable between the groups (aOR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.85). We could not evaluate the risks of CRRT and ECMO owing to the small number of events. Conclusion: RAAS inhibitor use was not associated with the composite of severe outcomes in the hypertensive patients with COVID-19 but significantly lowered the risk of ICU admission, particularly in patients who did not require IMV.","Bae, Jae Hyun; Choi, Sun Kyu; Kim, Nam Hoon; Lee, Juneyoung; Kim, Sin Gon",,,394

Additionally, PbtO2 signals have been used to derive indices thought to be associated with cerebrovascular reactivity in TBI. However, their true relationship to slow-wave vasogenic fluctuations associated with cerebral autoregulation remains unclear. The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between slow-wave fluctuations of intracranial pressure (ICP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and PbtO2 over time. Using the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) high resolution ICU sub-study cohort, we evaluated those patients with recorded high-frequency digital intra-parenchymal ICP and PbtO2 monitoring data of a minimum of 6 h in duration. Digital physiologic signals were processed for ICP, MAP, and PbtO2 slow-waves using a moving average filter to decimate the high-frequency signal. The first 5 days of recording were analyzed. The relationship between ICP, MAP and PbtO2 slow-waves over time were assessed using autoregressive integrative moving average (ARIMA) and vector autoregressive integrative moving average (VARIMA) modelling, as well as Granger causality testing. A total of 47 patients were included. The ARIMA structure of ICP and MAP were similar in time, where PbtO2 displayed different optimal structure. VARIMA modelling and IRF plots confirmed the strong directional relationship between MAP and ICP, demonstrating an ICP response to MAP impulse. PbtO2 slow-waves, however, failed to demonstrate a definite response to ICP and MAP slow-wave impulses. These results raise questions as to the utility of PbtO2 in the derivation of cerebrovascular reactivity measures in TBI. There is a reproducible relationship between slow-wave fluctuations of ICP and MAP, as demonstrated across various time-series analytic techniques. PbtO2 does not appear to reliably respond in time to slow-wave fluctuations in MAP, as demonstrated on various VARIMA models across all patients.

The advent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted not only in the closing of most outpatient clinics for face-to-face consultations but also in the inability to perform most laboratory and imaging investigations. This has resulted in a paradigm shift in the delivery of care for those with diabetic foot ulcers. The approaches to this challenge in two centers with an interest in diabetic foot disease, including virtual consultations using physician-to-patient and physician-to-home nurse telemedicine as well as home podiatry visits, are described in this review and are illustrated by several case vignettes. The outcomes from these two centers suggest that we may be witnessing new possibilities in models of care for the diabetic foot.","Shin, Laura; Bowling, Frank L; Armstrong, David G; Boulton, Andrew J M",Diabetes care,,394

As many commercial antibody tests are either time-consuming or tend to produce false negative or false positive results when only one antigen is considered, we developed an automated, flow-based chemiluminescence microarray immunoassay (CL-MIA) that allows for the detection of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), spike protein (S1 fragment), and nucleocapsid protein (N) in human serum and plasma in less than 8 min. The CoVRapid CL-MIA was tested with a set of 65 SARS-CoV-2 serology positive or negative samples, resulting in 100% diagnostic specificity and 100% diagnostic sensitivity, thus even outcompeting commercial tests run on the same sample set. Additionally, the prospect of future quantitative assessments (i.e., quantifying the level of antibodies) was demonstrated. Due to the fully automated process, the test can easily be operated in hospitals, medical practices, or vaccination centers, offering a valuable tool for COVID-19 serosurveillance.

MiRNAs are expressed by more than 200 organisms ranging from viruses to higher eukaryotes. Since miRNAs seem to be involved in host-pathogen interactions, many studies attempted to identify whether human miRNAs could target severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mRNAs as an antiviral defence mechanism. In this work, a machine learning based miRNA analysis workflow was developed to predict differential expression patterns of human miRNAs during SARS-CoV-2 infection. In order to obtain the graphical representation of miRNA hairpins, 36 features were defined based on the secondary structures. Moreover, potential targeting interactions between human circRNAs and miRNAs as well as human miRNAs and viral mRNAs were investigated.","Demirci, Yilmaz Mehmet; Saçar Demirci, Müserref Duygu",J Integr Bioinform,,394

While compassion towards patients is central to the nursing role, often 'compassion towards the compassionate' is lacking. The need for compassion is even more important now, and in the months ahead, due to the additional stressors experienced by nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic, whether they are on the front line, furloughed or shielding. This article includes reflections from nursing staff and uses their stories to encourage reflection on ethical and moral dilemmas experienced during the pandemic. The Compassion in the Workplace model is suggested as a tool that can be used by nurse managers to examine their compassion levels and to support the development of a compassionate workplace. In addition, this article offers some practical ideas on what compassionate leadership might look like in day-to-day practice.","Vogel, Sarah; Flint, Beth",Nurs Manag (Harrow),,394

Self-assessed health was also examined as a potential moderator. METHODS: A cross-sectional sample (N = 463) completed online questionnaires during a COVID-19-related lockdown that measured engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviours (e.g., exercising and eating fruits and vegetables), adherence to coronavirus protective behaviours (e.g., wearing a face mask and practicing social distancing), and self-assessed health (subjective evaluation of overall health). RESULTS: As predicted, higher engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviours prior to the pandemic was significantly correlated with higher adherence to coronavirus protective behaviours (Pearson r(459) = .308, p < .001). Adherence levels were higher than engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviours, and self-assessed health was related to the latter but not to the former. Moderation was examined using model 1 in PROCESS for SPSS; as expected, the association was stronger among individuals with higher levels of self-assessed health (coefficient 95% CI [.04, .20]). CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight cross-behavioural facilitating processes, specifically between lifestyle behaviours and adherence to recommended protective behaviours during the pandemic. They also draw attention to the need to address individuals whose poorer evaluations of their general health might prevent them from implementing their behavioural intentions.","Nudelman, Gabriel; Peleg, Shira; Shiloh, Shoshana",Int. j. behav. med,,394

449923,Fiscal solidarity: The conditional role of political knowledge,2020,"Electricity load forecasting is crucial for the power systems' planning and maintenance. However, its un-stationary and non-linear characteristics impose significant difficulties in anticipating future demand. This paper proposes a novel ensemble deep Random Vector Functional Link (edRVFL) network for electricity load forecasting. The weights of hidden layers are randomly initialized and kept fixed during the training process. The hidden layers are stacked to enforce deep representation learning. Then, the model generates the forecasts by ensembling the outputs of each layer. Moreover, we also propose to augment the random enhancement features by empirical wavelet transformation (EWT). The raw load data is decomposed by EWT in a walk-forward fashion, not introducing future data leakage problems in the decomposition process. Finally, all the sub-series generated by the EWT, including raw data, are fed into the edRVFL for forecasting purposes. The proposed model is evaluated on twenty publicly available time series from the Australian Energy Market Operator of the year 2020. The simulation results demonstrate the proposed model's superior performance over eleven forecasting methods in three error metrics and statistical tests on electricity load forecasting tasks.","Gao, Ruobin; Du, Liang; Suganthan, P.

DESIGN: This was a retrospective, multicenter clinical study. SETTING: This study used a multicenter dataset from 4 hospitals in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: Patients and health care providers with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV from January 23 to 31, 2020, at the Wuhan Union Hospital, the Wuhan Children's Hospital, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, and the Wuhan Fourth Hospital in Wuhan, China. INTERVENTIONS: Anesthetic management and infection control guidelines for emergency procedures for patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were drafted and applied in 4 hospitals in Wuhan. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Cross-infection in the operating rooms of the 4 hospitals was effectively reduced by implementing the new measures and procedures. The majority of patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection or suspected infection were female (23 [62%] of 37), and the mean age was 41.0 years old (standard deviation 19.6; range 4-78). 10 (27%) patients had chronic medical illnesses, including 4 (11%) with diabetes, 8 (22%) with hypertension, and 8 (22%) with digestive system disease. Twenty-five (68%) patients presented with lymphopenia, and 23 (62%) patients exhibited multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity on computed tomography scanning. CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates that COVID 19-specific guidelines for emergency procedures for patients with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV may effectively prevent cross-infection in the operating room. Most patients with confirmed or suspected COVID 19 presented with fever and dry cough and demonstrated bilateral multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity on chest computed tomography scans.","Zhao, Shuai; Ling, Ken; Yan, Hong; Zhong, Liang; Peng, Xiaohong; Yao, Shanglong; Huang, Jiapeng; Chen, Xiangdong",J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth,,394

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, students were barred access. This prompted us to launch and evaluate a new freeware PET/CT viewing system hosted in the university network. METHODS: We asked our students to install the multiplatform Fiji viewer with Beth Israel PET/CT plugin (http://petctviewer.org) on their personal computers and connect to a central image database in the university network based on the public domain orthanc server (https://orthanc-server.com). At the end of course, we conducted an anonymous student survey. RESULTS: The new system was online within eight days, including regulatory approval. All 76 students (100â%) in the fifth year completed their course work, reading five anonymized PET/CT cases as planned. 41 (53â%) students answered the survey. Fiji was challenging to install with a mean score of 1.8 on a 5-point Likert scale (5â=âeasy, 1â=âdifficult). Fiji was more difficult to use (score 3.0) than the previously used diagnostic workstations in the hospital (score 4.1; pâ<â0.001, paired t-test). Despite the technical challenge, 47â% of students reported having learnt much (scores 4 and 5); only 11â% were negative (scores 1 and 2). 51â% found the PET/CT tasks engaging (scores 4 and 5) while 20â% and 5â% returned scores 2 and 1, respectively. CONCLUSION: Despite the initial technical challenge, ""hands-on"" learning of PET/CT based on the freeware Fiji/orthanc PET/CT-viewer was associated with a high degree of student satisfaction. We plan to continue running the system to give students permanent access to PET/CT cases in native format regardless of time or location.","Biermann, Martin; Kanoun, Salim; Davidsen, Trond; Gray, Robert",Nuklearmedizin,,394
452071,Which are the best practices for MSc programmes in sustainable agriculture?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Early reports indicate that COVID-19 may require intensive care unit (ICU) admission in 5-26% and overall mortality can rise to 11% of the recognised cases, particularly affecting the elderly. There is a lack of evidence-based targeted pharmacological therapy for its prevention and treatment. We aim to compare the effects of a World Health Organization recommendation-based education and a personalised complex preventive lifestyle intervention package (based on the same WHO recommendation) on the outcomes of the COVID-19. METHODS: PROACTIVE-19 is a pragmatic, randomised controlled clinical trial with adaptive ""sample size re-estimation"" design. Hungarian population over the age of 60 years without confirmed COVID-19 will be approached to participate in a telephone health assessment and lifestyle counselling voluntarily. Volunteers will be randomised into two groups: (A) general health education and (B) personalised health education. Participants will go through questioning and recommendation in 5 fields: (1) mental health, (2) smoking habits, (3) physical activity, (4) dietary habits, and (5) alcohol consumption. Both groups A and B will receive the same line of questioning to assess habits concerning these topics. Assessment will be done weekly during the first month, every second week in the second month, then monthly. The composite primary endpoint will include the rate of ICU admission, hospital admission (longer than 48 h), and mortality in COVID-19-positive cases. The estimated sample size is 3788 subjects per study arm. The planned duration of the follow-up is a minimum of 1 year. DISCUSSION: These interventions may boost the body's cardiovascular and pulmonary reserve capacities, leading to improved resistance against the damage caused by COVID-19. Consequently, lifestyle changes can reduce the incidence of life-threatening conditions and attenuate the detrimental effects of the pandemic seriously affecting the older population.

In a country dramatically affected by COVID-19 pandemic and by an exponential increase in emerging and neglected diseases, particularly the poor, these RD&I constraints for vaccines become crucial governance issues. Such constraints are aggravated by a global scenario of limited commercial interest from multinational companies in vaccines for neglected and emerging diseases, which are falling into a ""valley of death,"" with only two vaccines produced in a pipeline of 240 vaccines. We stress that these constraints in the global pipeline are a window of opportunity for vaccine manufacturers in Brazil and other developing countries in the current paradigm transition towards Vaccinology 4.0.

However, such general guidance does not provide information regarding COVID-19 risks in patients with suffering from pre-existing thyroid problems, and furthermore, we do not know whether patients with COVID-19 (symptomatic or without symptoms), who have not previously had thyroid issues develop endocrine thyroid dysfunction after infection. The European Society for Endocrinology recently published a statement on COVID-19 and endocrine diseases (Endocrine, 2020); however, thyroid diseases were not mentioned specifically. We have therefore reviewed the current literature on thyroid diseases (excluding cancer) and COVID-19, including data from the previous coronavirus pandemic caused by the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a member of the same family Coronaviridae leading to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

In the face of the projected catastrophic consequences, many countries have enacted social distancing measures in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus. Under these conditions, the Web has become an indispensable medium for information acquisition, communication, and entertainment. At the same time, unfortunately, the Web is being exploited for the dissemination of potentially harmful and disturbing content, such as the spread of conspiracy theories and hateful speech towards specific ethnic groups, in particular towards Chinese people since COVID-19 is believed to have originated from China. In this paper, we make a first attempt to study the emergence of Sinophobic behavior on the Web during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. We collect two large-scale datasets from Twitter and 4chan's Politically Incorrect board (/pol/) over a time period of approximately five months and analyze them to investigate whether there is a rise or important differences with regard to the dissemination of Sinophobic content. We find that COVID-19 indeed drives the rise of Sinophobia on the Web and that the dissemination of Sinophobic content is a cross-platform phenomenon: it exists on fringe Web communities like \dspol, and to a lesser extent on mainstream ones like Twitter. Also, using word embeddings over time, we characterize the evolution and emergence of new Sinophobic slurs on both Twitter and /pol/. Finally, we find interesting differences in the context in which words related to Chinese people are used on the Web before and after the COVID-19 outbreak: on Twitter we observe a shift towards blaming China for the situation, while on /pol/ we find a shift towards using more (and new) Sinophobic slurs.","Schild, Leonard; Ling, Chen; Blackburn, Jeremy; Stringhini, Gianluca; Zhang, Yang; Zannettou, Savvas",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04046v1.pdf,394

However, while tonal expectations were associated with emotion in adults, little is known about the tonality emotional effects in children. Here we examine whether children associate levels of tonal closure with emotional valence, whether such associations are age dependent, and how they interact with other musical dimensions. 52 children, aged 7, 11, listened to chord progressions implying closure followed by a probe tone. Probes could realize closure (tonic note), violate it mildly (unstable diatonic note) or extremely (out of key note). Three timbres (piano, guitar, woodwinds) and three pitch heights were used for each closure level. Stimuli were described to participants as exchanges between two children (chords, probe). Participants chose one of two emojis, suggesting positive or negative emotions, as representing the 2nd child response. A significant effect of tonal closure was found, with no interactions with age, instrument, or pitch height. Results suggest that tonality, a non referential cognitive schema, affects children perception of emotion in music early, robustly and independently of basic musical dimensions.","Suberry, Assaf; Maimon, Neta B.; Eitan, Zohar",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.01810v1.pdf,394
455441,Call for papers: Resilience in Project Studies: An Interdisciplinary Discourse,2020,"When the first wave of COVID-19 hit in March 2020, health care professionals across Canada were challenged to quickly and efficiently adapt to change their work practices in these unprecedented times. Pharmacy professionals, being some of the very few front-line health care workers who remained accessible in person for patients, had to rapidly adopt critical changes in their pharmacies to respond in the best interest of their patients and their pharmacy staff. As challenging and demanding as such changes were, they provided pharmacists with invaluable lessons that would be imperative as the country enters a potentially more dangerous second wave. This article seeks to identify and summarize opportunities for improvement in pharmacy as learnt from the pandemic's first wave. Such areas include but are not limited to handling of drug shortage and addressing drug hoarding and stockpiling, providing physical and mental support for staff, timing of flu vaccine and COVID-19 screening/testing, collaboration between different health care sites as well as collaboration with patients and with other health care professionals, telemedicine and willingness to adopt innovative ideas, need for more staff training and more precise research to provide accurate information and finally the need for more organizational and workplace support. Learning from what went well and what did not work in the early stages of the pandemic is integral to ensure pharmacy professionals are better prepared to protect themselves and their patients amidst a second and possibly subsequent waves.","Elbeddini, Ali; Botross, Amy; Gerochi, Rachel; Gazarin, Mohamed; Elshahawi, Ahmed",J Pharm Policy Pract,,394
455493,Neural network analytics and forecasting the country's business climate in conditions of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19),2021,"The health risk of the coronavirus pandemic is age-specific. The symptoms of a COVID-19 infection are usually mild in the healthy population below the age of 65; however, the measures laid down to prevent the spread of the virus apply typically to the whole population. Hence, those who have a low risk of severe symptoms face a social dilemma in cooperating and complying with the safety measures: Cooperating in preventing the spread of the disease is good for society but comes with individual costs. These costs provide an incentive not to cooperate with the safety measures. In this paper we analyze via structural equation modelling a sample of young adults (N = 510) who were surveyed right after the end of the first lockdown period in Switzerland. We investigate why and to what extent they cooperated in preventing the epidemic by following the recommendation to stay at home as much as possible. We hypothesize that those respondents who perceive themselves to be personally at risk, or who have relatives belonging to the risk group, complied more often with the safety measures as compared to those without severe risks. Cooperating should also be linked to individuals' pro-social orientation. Furthermore, we hypothesize that those who believe that the virus is dangerous for society or who have a personal interest in protection show higher support for the general safety measures. Our empirical results show that compliance with the coronavirus social distancing measures was generally very high during the first lockdown. Although young adults perceived themselves to be at low personal risk, they still believed that the virus is dangerous for society. Those who had a personal interest in staying at home because they had relatives belonging to the risk group complied more often with the safety measures. Overall, the results suggest that the support of the preventive measures is the most important promoter of cooperation to prevent the spread of COVID-19.","Franzen, Axel; Wöhner, Fabienne",PLoS One,,394
455494,Neural network analytics and forecasting the country's business climate in conditions of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19),2021,"After the WHO designated COVID-19 a global pandemic, face masks have become a precious commodity worldwide. However, uncertainty remains around several details regarding face masks, including the potential for transmission of bioaerosols depending on the type of mask and secondary spread by face masks. Thus, understanding the interplay between face mask structure and harmful bioaerosols is essential for protecting public health. Here, we evaluated the microbial survival rate at each layer of commercial of filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) and surgical masks (SMs) using bacterial bioaerosols. The penetration efficiency of bacterial particles for FFRs was lower than that for SMs; however, the microbial survival rate for all tested masks was >13%, regardless of filtration performance. Most bacterial particles survived in the filter layer (44%-77%) (e.g., the core filtering layer); the outer layer also exhibited significant survival rates (18%-29%). Most notably, survival rates were determined for the inner layers (<1% for FFRs, 3%-16% for SMs), which are in contact with the respiratory tract. Our comparisons of the permeability and survival rate of bioaerosols in each layer will contribute to bioaerosol-face mask research, while also providing information to facilitate the establishment of a mask-reuse protocol.","Jeong, Sang Bin; Heo, Ki Joon; Ko, Hyun Sik; Ahn, Jae Pyoung; Lee, Seung-Bok; Jung, Jae Hee",Indoor Air,,394

455797,Prehabilitation could save lives in a pandemic,2020,"The co-evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with their host galaxies remains to be fully explored, especially at high redshift. While often understood as a consequence of self-regulation via AGN feedback, it may also be explained by alternative SMBH accretion models. Here, we expand on previous work by studying the growth of SMBHs with the help of a large suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations (\textsc{\small{MassiveFIRE}}) that are part of the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. The growth of SMBHs is modeled in post-processing with different accretion models, placements, and merger treatments, and validated by comparing to on-the-fly calculations. Scaling relations predicted by the gravitational torque driven accretion (GTDA) model agree with observations at low redshift \emph{without} the need for AGN feedback, in contrast to models in which the accretion rate depends strongly on SMBH mass. At high redshift, we find deviations from the local scaling relations in line with previous results. In particular, SMBHs are under-massive, presumably due to stellar feedback, but start to grow efficiently once their host galaxies reach $M_* \sim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$. We analyze and explain these findings in the context of a simple analytic model. Finally, we show that the predicted scaling relations depend sensitively on the efficiency of SMBH merging. These findings highlight the relevance of understanding the evolution of SMBH-galaxy scaling relations to predict the rate of gravitational wave signals from SMBH mergers across cosmic history.","cCatmabacak, Onur; Feldmann, Robert; Angl'es-Alc'azar, Daniel; Faucher-Giguere, Claude-Andr'e; Hopkins, Philip F.; Science, Duvsan Kerevs Institute for Computational; Zurich, University of; Zurich,; Switzerland,; Physics, Department of; Connecticut, University of; Storrs,; CT,; USA,; Astrophysics, Center for Computational; Institute, Flatiron; York, New; NY,; Astronomy,; CIERA,; University, Northwestern; Evanston,; IL,; TAPIR,; Technology, California Institute of; Pasadena,; CA,; Astrophysics, Center for; Sciences, Space; Diego, University of California at San; Jolla, La",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.12185v1.pdf,394

456355,Deep COVID DeteCT: an international experience on COVID-19 lung detection and prognosis using chest CT,2021,"In the paper, we propose a semiparametric framework for modeling the COVID-19 pandemic. The stochastic part of the framework is based on Bayesian inference. The model is informed by the actual COVID-19 data and the current epidemiological findings about the disease. The framework combines many available data sources (number of positive cases, number of patients in hospitals and in intensive care, etc.) to make outputs as accurate as possible and incorporates the times of non-pharmaceutical governmental interventions which were adopted worldwide to slow-down the pandemic. The model estimates the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2, the number of infected individuals and the number of patients in different disease progression states in time. It can be used for estimating current infection fatality rate, proportion of individuals not detected and short term forecasting of important indicators for monitoring the state of the healthcare system. With the prediction of the number of patients in hospitals and intensive care units, policy makers could make data driven decisions to potentially avoid overloading the capacities of the healthcare system. The model is applied to Slovene COVID-19 data showing the effectiveness of the adopted interventions for controlling the epidemic by reducing the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2. It is estimated that the proportion of infected people in Slovenia was among the lowest in Europe (0.350%, 90% CI [0.245-0.573]%), that infection fatality rate in Slovenia until the end of first wave was 1.56% (90% CI [0.94-2.21]%) and the proportion of unidentified cases was 88% (90% CI [83-93]%). The proposed framework can be extended to more countries/regions, thus allowing for comparison between them. One such modification is exhibited on data for Slovene hospitals.","Manevski, Damjan; Ruzic Gorenjec, Nina; Kejzar, Natasa; Blagus, Rok",Math Biosci,,394
456591,A study on healthy breathing pattern when wearing a mask,2020,"BACKGROUND: Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region of China, recorded its first confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case on 23 January 2020. We reviewed the case epidemiology and the various public health measures implemented from January to May 2020. METHODS: The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the cases recorded in different phases of the epidemic were described and compared, and the effectiveness of the public health measures implemented were reviewed using the changes in the daily number of confirmed cases and the interval from symptom onset to hospital admission. RESULTS: Between January and May 2020, 1084 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported, about 70% of which had a history of travel during the incubation period. The case fatality ratio was 0.4%. The local epidemic progressed through four phases: (1) preparedness and imported infection from mainland China, (2) local transmission, (3) imported infection from overseas countries associated with local transmission, and (4) controlled imported infection with limited local transmission, with an eventual reduction of the daily case number and minimization of the onset-to-admission interval. Various public health measures, including enhanced surveillance, border control, and social distancing, were introduced in phases in response to the prevailing local and global situations. DISCUSSION: The overall containment strategy in Hong Kong led to a stabilization of the number of cases and the absence of a community-wide outbreak during the 4.5 m after the first case was reported. This strategy of containment might serve as an example for future planning of preparedness and response against novel infectious agents.","Lam, Ho Yeung; Lam, Tsz Sum; Wong, Chi Hong; Lam, Wing Hang; Leung, Chi Mei Emily; Au, Ka Wing Albert; Lam, Chau Kuen Yonnie; Lau, Tin Wai Winnie; Chan, Yung Wai Desmond; Wong, Ka Hing; Chuang, Shuk Kwan",Int J Infect Dis,,394
456913,Introduction to the Special Issue: Mental Health in Therapeutic Recreation,2020,"The Coronavirus (COVID-19), which is an infectious pulmonary disorder, has affected millions of people and has been declared as a global pandemic by the WHO. Due to highly contagious nature of COVID-19 and its high possibility of causing severe conditions in the patients, the development of rapid and accurate diagnostic tools have gained importance. The real-time reverse transcription-polymerize chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used to detect the presence of Coronavirus RNA by using the mucus and saliva mixture samples. But, RT-PCR suffers from having low-sensitivity especially in the early stage. Therefore, the usage of chest radiography has been increasing in the early diagnosis of COVID-19 due to its fast imaging speed, significantly low cost and low dosage exposure of radiation. In our study, a computer-aided diagnosis system for X-ray images based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which can be used by radiologists as a supporting tool in COVID-19 detection, has been proposed. Deep feature sets extracted by using CNNs were concatenated for feature level fusion and fed to multiple classifiers in terms of decision level fusion idea with the aim of discriminating COVID-19, pneumonia and no-finding classes. In the decision level fusion idea, a majority voting scheme was applied to the resultant decisions of classifiers. The obtained accuracy values and confusion matrix based evaluation criteria were presented for three progressively created data-sets. The aspects of the proposed method that are superior to existing COVID-19 detection studies have been discussed and the fusion performance of proposed approach was validated visually by using Class Activation Mapping technique. The experimental results show that the proposed approach has attained high COVID-19 detection performance that was proven by its comparable accuracy and superior precision/recall values with the existing studies.","Ilhan, Hamza Osman; Serbes, Gorkem; Aydin, Nizamettin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08528v1.pdf,394

Health experts decry Trump's freeze on U.S. funding for WHO as world fights pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze computed tomography (CT) features of symptomatic patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: Ninety-five symptomatic patients with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction from 1 May to 14 July 2020 were retrospectively enrolled. Follow-up CT findings and their distributions were analyzed and compared from symptom onset to late-stage disease. RESULTS: Among all patients, 15.8% had unilateral lung disease and 84.2% had bilateral disease with slight right lower lobe predilection (47.4%). Regarding lesion density, 49.4% of patients had pure ground glass opacity (GGO) and 50.5% had GGO with consolidation. Typical early-stage patterns were bilateral lesions in 73.6% of patients, diffuse lesions (41.0%), and GGO (65.2%). Pleural effusion occurred in 13.6% and mediastinal lymphadenopathy in 11.5%. During intermediate-stage disease, 47.4% of patients showed GGO as the disease progressed; however, consolidation was the predominant finding (52.6%). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pneumonia manifested on lung CT scans with bilateral, peripheral, and right lower lobe predominance and was characterized by diffuse bilateral GGO progressing to or coexisting with consolidation within 1 to 3 weeks. The most frequent CT lesion in the early, intermediate, and late phases was GGO. Consolidation appeared in the intermediate phase and gradually increased, ending with reticular and lung fibrosis-like patterns.","Darwish, Hoda Salah; Habash, Mohamed Yasser; Habash, Waleed Yasser",J Int Med Res,,394

Objective: To evaluate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the myocardial tissue from autopsy cases and to document a possible cardiac response to that infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used data from consecutive autopsy cases from Germany between April 8 and April 18, 2020. All patients had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in pharyngeal swab tests. Exposures: Patients who died of coronavirus disease 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in cardiac tissue as well as CD3+, CD45+, and CD68+ cells in the myocardium and gene expression of tumor necrosis growth factor &#945;, interferon Î³, chemokine ligand 5, as well as interleukin-6, -8, and -18. Results: Cardiac tissue from 39 consecutive autopsy cases were included. The median (interquartile range) age of patients was 85 (78-89) years, and 23 (59.0%) were women. SARS-CoV-2 could be documented in 24 of 39 patients (61.5%). Viral load above 1000 copies per µg RNA could be documented in 16 of 39 patients (41.0%). A cytokine response panel consisting of 6 proinflammatory genes was increased in those 16 patients compared with 15 patients without any SARS-CoV-2 in the heart. Comparison of 15 patients without cardiac infection with 16 patients with more than 1000 copies revealed no inflammatory cell infiltrates or differences in leukocyte numbers per high power field. Conclusions and Relevance: In this analysis of autopsy cases, viral presence within the myocardium could be documented. While a response to this infection could be reported in cases with higher virus load vs no virus infection, this was not associated with an influx of inflammatory cells. Future investigations should focus on evaluating the long-term consequences of this cardiac involvement.","Lindner, Diana; Fitzek, Antonia; Bräuninger, Hanna; Aleshcheva, Ganna; Edler, Caroline; Meissner, Kira; Scherschel, Katharina; Kirchhof, Paulus; Escher, Felicitas; Schultheiss, Heinz-Peter; Blankenberg, Stefan; Püschel, Klaus; Westermann, Dirk",JAMA Cardiol,,394

We succeeded in preparing disinfectant cellulose-based wipes treated with antimicrobial and antiviral silver nanoparticles to be used for prevention of contamination and transmission of several pathogenic viruses and microbes to human in critical areas such as hospitals and healthcare centers especially coronavirus. In this work, the antimicrobial and antiviral activities of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) prepared with four different techniques were investigated for the utilization as a disinfectant for cellulose-based wipes. These four methods are namely; 1) trisodium citrate with cotton yarn as a reducing agent, 2) preparing AgNP's using aqueous solution of PVA in the presence of glucose, 3) trisodium citrate with cotton fabric as a reducing agent, and 4) photochemical reaction of polyacrylic acid and silver nitrate solution. Polyester/viscose blended spunlace nonwoven fabrics as cellulose based fabrics were treated with the prepared silver nanoparticles to be used as surfaces disinfection wipes. The properties of the nonwoven fabrics were examined including thickness, tensile strength in dry and wet conditions in both machine direction (MD) and cross-machine direction (CMD), bursting strength, air permeability, water permeability and surface wettability. Characterization of the AgNPs was carried out in terms of UV-VIS spectroscopy, TEM, SEM, and Zeta potential analysis. The assessment of AgNPs active solutions for antimicrobial and antiviral activities was evaluated. The results obtained from the analyses of the AgNPs samples prepared with different techniques showed good uniformity and stability of the particles, as well uniform coating of the AgNPs on the fibers. Additionally, there is a significant effect of the AgNPs preparation method on their disinfectant performance that proved its effectiveness against coronavirus (MERS-CoV), S. aureus and B. subtilis as Gram-positive bacteria, E. coli and P. mirabilis as Gram-negative bacteria, A. niger and C. albicans fungi.","Hamouda, Tamer; Ibrahim, Hassan M; Kafafy, H H; Mashaly, H M; Mohamed, Nasser H; Aly, Nermin M",Int J Biol Macromol,,394

Prevalence of liver injury and associated clinical characteristics are not well-defined. We aim to identify the prevalence of and risk factors for development of COVID-19 associated acute liver injury in a large cohort in the United States. APPROACH & RESULTS: In this retrospective cohort study, all patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing at three hospitals in the NewYork-Presbyterian network were assessed. Of 3381 patients, 2273 tested positive and had higher initial and peak ALT than those who tested negative. Acute liver injury was categorized as mild if alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was > upper limit of normal (ULN) but < two times ULN, moderate if ALT was between two and five times ULN, and severe if ALT was > five times ULN. Among patients who tested positive, 45% had mild, 21% moderate, and 6.4% severe liver injury. In multivariable analysis, severe acute liver injury was significantly associated with elevated inflammatory markers including ferritin (OR 2.40, p<0.001) and IL-6 (OR 1.45, p=0.009). Patients with severe liver injury had a more severe clinical course, including higher rates of ICU admission (69%), intubation (65%), renal replacement therapy (33%), and mortality (42%). In multivariable analysis, peak ALT was significantly associated with death or discharge to hospice (OR 1.14, p=0.044), controlling for age, body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, intubation, and renal replacement therapy. CONCLUSION: Acute liver injury is common in patients who test positive for SARS-CoV-2, but is most often mild. However, among the 6.4% of patients with severe liver injury, a severe disease course should be anticipated.","Phipps, Meaghan M; Barraza, Luis H; LaSota, Elijah D; Sobieszczyk, Magdalena E; Pereira, Marcus R; Zheng, Elizabeth X; Fox, Alyson N; Zucker, Jason; Verna, Elizabeth C",Hepatology (Baltim.),,394

Using a national survey of Generation Z conducted in late-May of 2020, our study measures attitudes toward the impact of the Coronavirus on personal health, financial and job concerns, views about shelter-in-place laws, and voting intentions in the 2020 presidential election. We find that Gen Z women express greater health and economic concerns and support for shelter-in-place measures than their male counterparts but this gender gap is largely mitigated by party identification and other covariates. Party also mediates the differences between young male and female voters in regard to the influence of the Coronavirus on their vote choice in 2020. Notably, however, women regardless of party affiliation hold significantly greater concern toward the impact of COVID-19 on their personal financial situation. Yet we find that Gen Z men express more concern about their personal health amid COVID-19 in more fully-specified statistical models. This research contributes to the growing literature that examines not only the sorting effect of party on the gender gap, but how different identitiesa-in this case generationa-can help explain the persistent political divides between men and women.","Deckman, Melissa; McDonald, Jared; Rouse, Stella; Kromer, Mileah",Polit.

CASE REPORT A 48-year-old man was diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) in 3 vessels (3VD) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 61% and chronic kidney disease (CKD) with routine hemodialysis. The patient was scheduled for a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. He underwent surgery after COVID-19 screening using a checklist provided by the hospital. The patient's condition worsened on the 3rd postoperative day in the ward, and he was transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), reintubated, and tested for COVID-19 with a real time-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we excluded the other possible pneumonia causes (e.g., influenza). An RT-PCR test performed after surgery revealed that the patient was positive for COVID-19. COVID-19 tracing was performed for all health care providers and relatives; all results were negative except for 1 family member. The patient was treated for 4 days in the isolation ICU but died due to complications of the infection. CONCLUSIONS This report shows the importance of testing patients for SARS-CoV-2 infection before hospital admission for elective surgery and during the hospital stay, and the importance of developing rapid and accurate testing methods that can be used in countries and centers with limited health resources.","Soetisna, Tri Wisesa; Buana, Andhika Citra; Tirta, Edward Suryadi; Ardiyan, Ardiyan; Aligheri, Dicky; Herlambang, Bagus; Tjubandi, Amin; Hanafy, Dudy Arman; Sugisman, Sugisman",Am J Case Rep,,394

It is suggested that leptin could be the missing link between obesity and severe COVID-19. Our study aimed to unravel the link between adipokines, COVID-19 status, immune response, and outcomes in severe pneumonia. METHODS: In this prospective observational single-center study, 63 immunocompetent patients with severe pneumonia (36 non-COVID-19 and 27 COVID-19) were enrolled, most required intensive care. Clinical and biological characteristics (glucose metabolism, plasma adipokines, and cytokine concentrations) and outcomes were compared. RESULTS: At similar baseline severity, COVID-19 patients required mechanical ventilation for significantly longer than non-COVID-19 patients (p = 0.0049). Plasma concentrations of leptin and adiponectin were respectively positively and negatively correlated with BMI and glucose metabolism (glycemia and insulinemia), but not significantly different between the two groups. Leptin levels were negatively correlated with IL-1ß and IL-6, but the adipokines were not correlated with most other inflammatory mediators, baseline severity (SOFA score), or the duration of mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: Adipokine levels were correlated with BMI but not with most inflammatory mediators, severity, or outcomes in severe pneumonia, regardless of the origin. The link between obesity, dysregulated immune response, and life-threatening COVID-19 requires further investigation.

464901,Evaluating the Effectiveness of COVID-19 Bluetooth-Based Smartphone Contact Tracing Applications,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has had significant negative economic ramifications on dermatologic care delivery, including curtailing live on-site physician-pharmaceutical-representative interactions (PPRI). OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of COVID-19 and pandemic regulations on current and future PPRI. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey-based study that analyzed data from 400 surveyed dermatologists using a pre-validated questionnaire sent via email. Data regarding PPRI were collected over 1 week in July 2020 to compare demographics and practice standards from April 2019, April 2020, July 2020, and predictions for 2021. RESULTS: Virtual-only PPRI increased from 7.8% in April 2019 to 26.5% during April 2020 (mean difference, 18.8%; 95% confidence interval, 13.6%&ndash;23.9%). Virtual-only PPRI remained elevated at 24.5% while hybrid PPRI increased, eventually surpassing the April 2019 mark (27.0%). These trends persisted among all studied practice types and levels of experience. Practices predicted no significant percent differences in participation in PPRI (87.3% vs 90.3%; P=0.0834), but a significant shift in method of delivery where the odds ratio of incorporating a virtual component into PPRI in 2021 increased by a factor of 3. LIMITATIONS: Relatively small sample size, especially among subgroups. Responses may have been retrospective estimates. There may also be selection bias given slightly increased representation of more experienced dermatologists. CONCLUSION: PPRI materially decreased during the initial COVID-19 peak but will likely return to baseline volume moving forward with a significant component being hybrid PPRI. Further studies may better elucidate the economic and clinical impact associated with these changes and their effect on dermatologists&rsquo; ability to provide patients with samples and educational materials.

465450,[Impact of the Coronavirus Crisis on Public Finances],2020,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19, a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, has become a global pandemic. Patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), often treated with immunosuppressants, might be at higher risk of developing COVID-19 and of demonstrating a severe disease course. We aimed to study prevalence and describe features of COVID-19 in MG patients. METHODS: in May 2020 we conducted telephonic interviews with MG patients followed at our referral center. We collected structured data regarding MG and COVID-19, which was diagnosed as probable or confirmed according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control case definition. We compared confirmed-COVID-19 prevalence calculated from the beginning of the pandemic in MG patients with that of the overall Pavia district. RESULTS: we interviewed 162 MG patients (median age, 66 years; interquartile range 41-77; males 59.9%), 88 from the Pavia district. Three patients had SARS-CoV-2-confirmed by PCR and 8 had probable-COVID-19. In the Pavia district, the prevalence of confirmed-COVID-19 among MG patients (1/88, 1.14%) and overall population (4,777/546,515, 0.87%) did not differ (p=0.538). Higher MGFA class and the need for recent rescue treatment, but not ongoing immunosuppressive treatments, were associated with COVID-19 risk. Three/11 MG patients with probable/confirmed-COVID-19 required ventilator support, and 2 elderly patients died of COVID-19 respiratory insufficiency. Only 1/11 patients experienced worsening MG symptoms, which improved after increasing their steroid dose. DISCUSSION: the risk of COVID-19 in MG patients seems to be no higher than that of the general population, regardless of immunosuppressive therapies. In our cohort, COVID-19 barely affected MG course.","Businaro, Pietro; Vaghi, Gloria; Marchioni, Enrico; Diamanti, Luca; Arceri, Sebastiano; Bini, Paola; Colombo, Elena; Cosentino, Giuseppe; Alfonsi, Enrico; Costa, Alfredo; Ravaglia, Sabrina; Mallucci, Giulia; Ballante, Elena; Franciotta, Diego; Gastaldi, Matteo",Muscle nerve,,394

466446,Towards Combatting COVID-19: A Risk Assessment System,2021,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has disrupted normal life and resulted in an online transformation of teaching. Little is known about how these changes affected academic stress in students. This study examined the role of changes of teaching methods on academic stress among university students during the first lockdown in Denmark. METHODS: The cross-sectional survey was part of the international ""COVID-19 International Student Well-being Study"" and included responses on socio-economic characteristics, infection worries, academic stress, work capacity and satisfaction with teaching from 1,541 Danish health and medical science university students in May-June 2020. Changes in academic stress were analysed using descriptive statistics and multi-variable analyses using stepwise logistic regression. RESULTS: A considerable part (39%) of students reported academic stress due to COVID-19. One third reported that their study workload had increased significantly due to the COVID-19 outbreak and that they were concerned about their ability to complete the academic year. Factors associated with academic stress were female sex, young age, bachelor level, knowing a COVID-19 patient and being worried about becoming infected, whereas immigration background, sufficient financial resources and living arrangements were not. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the COVID-19 outbreak has influenced university students' academic stress. It is important to set up structures to support students' mental health and educational trajectory during the pandemic. FUNDING: none. TRIAL REGISTRATION: not relevant.","Guldager, J.

467241,Design of a mobile app with the use of machine learning for the monitoring of coronavirus patients (Covid 19) in Peru,2020,"BACKGROUND: Falls could be serious events in Parkinson's disease (PD). Patient remote monitoring strategies are on the raise and may be an additional aid in identifying patients who are at risk of falling. The aim of the study was to evaluate if balance and timed-up-and-go data obtained by a smartphone application during COVID-19 lockdown were able to predict falls in PD patients. METHODS: A cohort of PD patients were monitored for 4 weeks during the COVID-19 lockdown with an application measuring static balance and timed-up-and-go test. The main outcome was the occurrence of falls (UPDRS-II item 13) during the observation period. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients completed the study, and 4 (12%) reported falls in the observation period. The rate of falls was reduced with respect to patient previous falls history (24%). The stand-up time and the mediolateral sway, acquired through the application, differed between ""fallers"" and ""non-fallers"" and related to the occurrence of new falls (OR 1.7 and 1.6 respectively, p < 0.05), together with previous falling (OR 7.5, p < 0.01). In a multivariate model, the stand-up time and the history of falling independently related to the outcome (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides new data on falls in Parkinson's disease during the lockdown. The reduction of falling events and the relationship with the stand-up time might suggest that a different quality of falls occurs when patient is forced to stay home - hence, clinicians should point their attention also on monitoring patients' sit-to-stand body transition other than more acknowledged features based on step quality.","Marano, Massimo; Motolese, Francesco; Rossi, Mariagrazia; Magliozzi, Alessandro; Yekutieli, Ziv; Di Lazzaro, Vincenzo",Neurol. sci,,394

468168,Decision support system for ranking relevant indicators for reopening strategies following COVID-19 lockdowns,2021,"By late 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), had caused tens of millions of infections and over 1 million deaths worldwide. A protective vaccine and more effective therapeutics are urgently needed. We evaluated a new poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, stenoparib, that recently advanced to phase II clinical trials for treatment of ovarian cancer, for activity against human respiratory coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, in vitro Stenoparib exhibits dose-dependent suppression of SARS-CoV-2 multiplication and spread in Vero E6 monkey kidney and Calu-3 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. Stenoparib was also strongly inhibitory to the human seasonal respiratory coronavirus HCoV-NL63. Compared to remdesivir, which inhibits viral replication downstream of cell entry, stenoparib impedes entry and postentry processes, as determined by time-of-addition (TOA) experiments. Moreover, a 10 µM dosage of stenoparib-below the approximated 25.5 µM half-maximally effective concentration (EC50)-combined with 0.5 µM remdesivir suppressed coronavirus growth by more than 90%, indicating a potentially synergistic effect for this drug combination. Stenoparib as a stand-alone or as part of combinatorial therapy with remdesivir should be a valuable addition to the arsenal against COVID-19.IMPORTANCE New therapeutics are urgently needed in the fight against COVID-19. Repurposing drugs that are either already approved for human use or are in advanced stages of the approval process can facilitate more rapid advances toward this goal. The PARP inhibitor stenoparib may be such a drug, as it is currently in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of ovarian cancer and its safety and dosage in humans have already been established. Our results indicate that stenoparib possesses strong antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses in vitro. This activity appears to be based on multiple modes of action, where both pre-entry and postentry viral replication processes are impeded. This may provide a therapeutic advantage over many current options that have a narrower target range. Moreover, our results suggest that stenoparib and remdesivir in combination may be especially potent against coronavirus infection.","Stone, Nathan E; Jaramillo, Sierra A; Jones, Ashley N; Vazquez, Adam J; Martz, Madison; Versluis, Lora M; Raniere, Marlee O; Nunnally, Haley E; Zarn, Katherine E; Nottingham, Roxanne; Ng, Ken R; Sahl, Jason W; Wagner, David M; Knudsen, Steen; Settles, Erik W; Keim, Paul; French, Christopher T",mBio (Online),,394
468204,"In light of the coronavirus pandemic, the Journal of Histotechnology marches on",2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak has spread worldwide and has resulted in hospital restrictions. The perceived impact of these practices on patients undergoing essential surgeries is less understood. METHODS: Adult (&#8805;18 years) patients who underwent medically necessary surgical procedures spanning multiple surgical specialties from March 23, 2020, to April 24, 2020, during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic were identified as eligible for a phone survey. Survey responses were analyzed using a mixed-methods approach involving descriptive statistics and thematic analysis of coded and annotated survey results. RESULTS: Of the 212 patients who underwent medically necessary surgical procedures during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the majority of these patients were male (61.3%), White (83.5%), married or with a domestic partner (68.9%), and underwent oncologic procedures (69.3%). Of the 46 patients (21.7%) who completed the survey, the majority of these patients indicated that coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic restrictions had no impact on their inpatient hospital stay and were satisfied with their decision to proceed with surgery. Severity of patient condition (44.4%), the risk/benefit discussion with the surgeon (24.4%), and coronavirus disease 2019 education and testing (19.5%) were the most important factors in proceeding with surgery during the pandemic; 34.4% of patients said their inpatient postoperative course was negatively affected by the lack of visitors. CONCLUSION: Medically necessary, time-sensitive surgical procedures, as determined by the surgeon, can be performed during a pandemic with good patient satisfaction provided there is an appropriate discussion between the surgeon and patient about the risks and benefits.","Shannon, Adrienne B; Roberson, Jeffrey L; Clapp, Justin T; Vaughan, Casey; Kleid, Melanie; Song, Yun; Miura, John T; Dempsey, Daniel T; DeMatteo, Ronald P; Fleisher, Lee A; Karakousis, Giorgos C",Surgery,,394

468875,Analysis of the NO2 tropospheric product from S5P TROPOMI for monitoring pollution at city scale,2020,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVE: This systematic literature review explores and maps what we know about survivorship to understand how survivorship can be theoretically defined. BACKGROUND: Survivorship of critical illness has been identified as a challenge for the 21st Century. Whilst the use of the term 'survivorship' is now common in critical care, it has been borrowed from the cancer literature where the discourse on what survivorship means in a cancer context is ongoing and remains largely descriptive. In the absence of a theoretical understanding, the term 'survivorship' is often used in critical illness in a generic way, limiting our understanding of what survivorship is. The current COVID-19 pandemic adds to an urgency of understanding what intensive care unit (ICU) survivorship might mean, given the emerging long-term consequences of this patient cohort. We set out to explore how survivorship after critical illness is being conceptualised and what the implications might be for clinical practice and research. DESIGN: Integrated systematic literature review. The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. PRISMA guidelines were followed and a PRISMA checklist for reporting systematic reviews completed. RESULTS: The three main themes around which the reviewed studies were organised are: (a) healthcare system; (b) ICU survivors' families; and (c) ICU survivor's identity. These three themes feed into an overarching core theme of 'ICU Survivorship Experiences'. These themes map our current knowledge of what happens when a patient survives a critical illness and where we are in understanding ICU survivorship. CONCLUSION: We mapped in this systematic review the different pieces of the jigsaw that emerge following critical illness to understand and see the bigger picture of what happens after patients survive critical illness. It is evident that existing research has mapped these connections, but what we have not managed to do yet is defining what survivorship is theoretically. We offer a preliminary definition of survivorship as a process but are aware that this definition needs to be developed further with patients and families.","Kean, Susanne; Donaghy, Eddie; Bancroft, Angus; Clegg, Gareth; Rodgers, Sheila",J. clin. nurs,,394

We sought to determine whether differences in instruction types at the beginning of the 2020-2021 school year were related to differences in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in Illinois counties during the first three weeks of the school year. METHODS: We divided Illinois counties into three groups based on the instruction type used for a majority of K-12 students at the start of the school year: in-person, hybrid, or online-only. We used synthetic control analysis to match counties between the three groups. RESULTS: Both majority hybrid and majority online-only counties had significantly fewer new cases than majority in-person counties. There were no significant differences in new cases between majority hybrid counties and majority online-only counties or in new hospital admissions or deaths between any of the three county groups. CONCLUSIONS: This paper adds to the growing scientific consensus that at least some forms of in-person K-12 instruction have not contributed significantly to the spread of the pandemic. However, our results suggest that there may be an important difference between fully in-person instruction and hybrid instruction.","Reinbold, Gary W",Am. j. infect. control,,394

469734,Financial Decisions and Reopening a Practice During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Survey of California Plastic Surgeons,2021,"Many novel diseases are of zoonotic origin, likely including COVID-19. Describing diseases as originating from a diverse range of animals is known to increase risk perceptions and intentions to engage in preventative behaviors. However, it is also possible that communications depicting use of exotic animals as food sources may activate stereotypes of cultures at the origin of a disease, increasing discriminatory behaviors and disease stigma. We used general linear modeling and mediation analysis to test experimental data on communications about zoonotic disease origins from the critical first two months leading up to the declaration of a global pandemic. Results suggest that communications about potential familiar food origins (pigs) affected people's risk perceptions, health behaviors, and COVID-19 stigma compared to more exotic food sources (e.g., snakes). Participants (N = 707) who read descriptions of exotic origins viewed the virus as riskier and reported stronger intentions to engage in preventative behaviors than those who read about familiar origins (pigs). However, reading exotic origin descriptions was also associated with stronger intentions to avoid Asian individuals and animal products. These results are critical for both theory and public policy. For theory, they are the first to experimentally demonstrate that zoonotic origin descriptions can impact intentions to engage in discriminatory behaviors for cultures viewed as the origin of a novel infectious disease. For policy, they offer clear, actionable insights on how to communicate about risks associated with a novel zoonosis while managing the potential impact on discriminatory behaviors and stigma.","LaCour, Mark; Hughes, Brent; Goldwater, Micah; Ireland, Molly; Worthy, Darrell; Van Allen, Jason; Gaylord, Nick; Van-Hoosier, Garrett; Davis, Tyler",Risk anal,,394

Case presentation: A 36-year-old man, who underwent living kidney transplantation 1.5 year prior, developed fever. After 10 days, he developed dyspnea, and his blood oxygen levels decreased. Computed tomography showed pulmonary ground-glass shadow on both lungs, and the coronavirus disease 2019 real-time polymerase chain reaction test was positive. After reducing the immunosuppressive agents, the C-reactive protein levels continued elevating, and the pulmonary shadow spread. Subsequently, low-dose methylprednisolone (40 mg/day) was administered for 4 days and his C-reactive protein and blood oxygen levels increased and improved, respectively. The coronavirus disease 2019 real-time polymerase chain reaction test was negative and the pulmonary shadow disappeared.

This study intends to examine the factors associated with cesarean section (CS) during lockdown time. METHODS: A total of 678 women who just gave birth within 7 days were enrolled from maternal and children hospitals in nine cities of China from April to May 2020. The delivery modes and potential influencing factors were investigated. The subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were used to examine the association of CS and risk factors among populations with different characteristics and to control for possible confounding, respectively. RESULTS: The overall rate of cesarean delivery was 37.3%. In multi-variant model, maternal age > 30 years (OR, 95% CI = 1.71, 1.21-2.41), higher pre-gestational BMI (OR, 95% CI = 1.16, 1.10-1.23), living in regions with confirmed COVID-19 cases > 500 (OR, 95% CI = 2.45, 1.74-3.45), and excess gestational weight gain (OR, 95% CI = 1.73, 1.17-2.55) were associated with cesarean delivery. These trends of associations were not changes in sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis. Cesarean delivery occurred more in women who got more nutrition instruction during the pandemic period in the univariant model; however, this association showed insignificance in the multiple-variant analysis.

478152,Deploying Resilience Enablers to Mitigate Risks in Sustainable Fashion Supply Chains,2021,"Porphyromonas gingivalis is a pathogen closely associated with periodontal and systemic infections. Recently, lysine acetylation (Kac) and lysine succinylation (Ksuc) have been identified in bacterial proteins with diverse biological and pathological functions. The Ksuc of P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 has been characterized in our previous work, and here, we report the systematic analysis of Kac and its crosstalk with Ksuc in this bacterium. A combination of the affinity enrichment by the acetyl-lysine antibody with highly sensitive LC-MS/MS was used to identify the lysine-acetylated proteins and sites in P. gingivalis ATCC 33277. A total of 1,112 lysine-acetylated sites matching 438 proteins were identified. These proteins involved in several cellular processes, especially those proteins related to protein biosynthesis and central metabolism had a high tendency to be lysine acetylated. Moreover, lysine sites flanked by tyrosine, phenylalanine, and histidine in the +1 position, as well as residue lysine in position +4 to +5, were the targets of Kac. Additionally, proteins involved in adhesins, gingipains, black pigmentation, and oxidative stress resistance were identified as substrates of Kac. Collectively, these results suggest Kac may play a critical role in the regulation of physiology and virulence of P. gingivalis. Furthermore, we discovered that, Ksuc and Kac were extensively overlapped in P. gingivalis ATCC 33277, especially in proteins related to ribosomes and metabolism. This study provides a significant beginning for further investigating the role of Kac and Ksuc in the pathogenicity of P. gingivalis.","Zeng, Jumei; Wu, Leng; Chen, Qiushi; Wang, Lingyun; Qiu, Wei; Zheng, Xin; Yin, Xiaoming; Liu, Jie; Ren, Yan; Li, Yuqing",Mol. oral microbiol.

478182,Moral Decision-Making in Medical Hybrid Intelligent Systems: A Team Design Patterns Approach to the Bias Mitigation and Data Sharing Design Problems,2021-02-16,"OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the patient experience of telemedicine for headache care during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. BACKGROUND: The use of telemedicine has rapidly expanded and evolved since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine eliminates the physical and geographic barriers to health care, preserves personal protective equipment, and prevents the spread of COVID-19 by allowing encounters to happen in a socially distanced way. However, few studies have assessed the patient perspective of telemedicine for headache care. METHODS: The American Migraine Foundation (AMF) designed a standardized electronic questionnaire to assess the patient experience of telemedicine for headache care between March and September 2020 to help inform future quality improvement as part of its patient advocacy initiative. The date parameters were identified as the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 disease and the declaration of a national emergency in the United States. The questionnaire was distributed electronically to more than 100,000 members of the AMF community through social media platforms and the AMF email database. RESULTS: A total of 1172 patients responded to our electronic questionnaire, with 1098 complete responses. The majority, 1081/1153 (93.8%) patients, had a previous headache diagnosis prior to the telemedicine encounter. A total of 648/1127 (57.5%) patients reported that they had used telemedicine for headache care during the study period. Among those who participated in telehealth visits, 553/647 (85.5%) patients used it for follow-up visits; 94/647 (14.5%) patients used it for new patient visits. During the telemedicine encounters, 282/645 (43.7%) patients were evaluated by headache specialists, 222/645 (34.4%) patients by general neurologists, 198/645 (30.7%) patients by primary care providers, 73/645 (11.3%) patients by headache nurse practitioners, and 21/645 (3.2%) patients by headache nurses. Only 47/633 (7.4%) patients received a new headache diagnosis from telemedicine evaluation, whereas the other 586/633 (92.6%) patients did not have a change in their diagnoses. During these visits, a new treatment was prescribed for 358/636 (52.3%) patients, whereas 278/636 (43.7%) patients did not have changes made to their treatment plan. The number (%) of patients who rated the telemedicine headache care experience as ""very good,"" ""good,"" ""fair,"" ""poor,"" and ""other"" were 396/638 (62.1%), 132/638 (20.7%), 67/638 (10.5%), 23/638 (3.6%), and 20/638 (3.1%), respectively. Detailed reasons for ""other"" are listed in the manuscript. Most patients, 573/638 (89.8%), indicated that they would prefer to continue to use telemedicine for their headache care, 45/638 (7.1%) patients would not, and 20/638 (3.1%) patients were unsure. CONCLUSIONS: Our study evaluating the patient perspective demonstrated that telemedicine facilitated headache care for many patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in high patient satisfaction rates, and a desire to continue to use telemedicine for future headache care among those who completed the online survey.","Chiang, Chia-Chun; Halker Singh, Rashmi; Lalvani, Nim; Shubin Stein, Ken; Henscheid Lorenz, Deborah; Lay, Christine; Dodick, David W; Newman, Lawrence C",Headache,,394

479081,Quantifying the Time-Lag Effects of Human Mobility on the COVID-19 Transmission: A Multi-City Study in China,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 crisis has drastically changed care delivery with teleconsultation platforms experiencing substantial spikes in demand, helping patients and care providers avoid infections and maintain health care services. Beyond the current pandemic, teleconsultation is considered a significant opportunity to address persistent health system challenges, including accessibility, continuity, and cost of care, while ensuring quality. OBJECTIVE: This study aims at identifying the determinants of patients' intention to continue using a teleconsultation platform. It extends prior research on information technology use continuance intention and teleconsultation services. METHODS: Data was collected in November 2018 and May 2019 with Canadian patients who had access to a teleconsultation platform. Measures included patients' intention to continue their use; teleconsultation usefulness; teleconsultation quality; patients' trust toward the digital platform, its provider. and health care professionals; and confirmation of patients' expectations toward teleconsultation. We used structural equation modeling employing the partial least squares component-based technique to test our research model and hypotheses. RESULTS: We analyzed a sample of 178 participants who had used teleconsultation services. Our findings revealed that confirmation of expectations had the greatest influence on continuance intention (total effects=0.722; P<.001), followed by usefulness (total effects=0.587; P<.001) and quality (total effects=0.511; P<.001). Usefulness (ß=.60; P<.001) and quality (ß=.34; P=.01) had direct effects on the dependent variable. The confirmation of expectations had direct effects both on usefulness (ß=.56; P<.001) and quality (ß=.75; P<.001) in addition to having an indirect effect on usefulness (indirect effects=0.282; P<.001). Last, quality directly influenced usefulness (ß=.34; P=.002) and trust (ß=.88; P<.001). Trust does not play a role in the context under study. CONCLUSIONS: Teleconsultation is central to care going forward, and it represents a significant lever for an improved, digital delivery of health care in the future. We believe that our findings will help drive long-term teleconsultation adoption and use, including in the aftermath of the current COVID-19 crisis, so that general care improvement and greater preparedness for exceptional situations can be achieved.","Grenier Ouimet, Antoine; Wagner, Gerit; Raymond, Louis; Pare, Guy",J Med Internet Res,,394

Here we conducted a retrospective longitudinal study aimed to analyze the clinical features and outcome of MHD patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Of 3126 inpatients with COVID-19 at 3 Branches of Wuhan Tongji Hospital from Jan 18th to Mar 9th, 2020, 19 patients were undergoing maintenance hemodialysis.

Baseline characteristics, clinical courses, laboratory findings, and dynamic trajectories of major laboratory markers were compared between survivors and nonsurvivors. According to our findings, MHD patients with COVID-19 who experienced non-surviving outcome had more elevated CRP, IL6 and procalcitonin as well as fibrinogen levels at various points compared to survivors. Thus the dysregulation of immune response as well as coagulation abnormalities might be highly involved in the pathological process of COVID-19, contributing to the poor prognosis in MHD patients.","Jin, Guan-Nan; Ding, Ze-Yang; Li, Gan-Xun; Hu, Jun-Bo; Liu, Ji-Hong; Zhang, Bixiang; Chen, Xiao-Ping",Int J Med Sci,,394

METHODS: Adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from 28 January 2020 to 4 March 2020 in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan were recruited. Data on related parameters were collected. Univariate analysis and multivariable binary logistic regression were used to explore predictors of critical illness and mortality. RESULTS: In total, 199 and 44 patients were enrolled in the training and testing sets, respectively. Elevated ferritin, tumor necrosis factor-&#945; and D-dimer and decreased albumin concentration were associated with disease severity. Older age, elevated ferritin and elevated interleukin-6 were associated with 28-day mortality. The FAD-85 score, defined as age + 0.01 * ferritin +D-dimer, was used to predict risk of mortality. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of FAD-85 were 86.4%, 81.8% and 86.4%, respectively. A nomogram was established using age, ferritin and D-dimer to predict the risk of 28-day mortality.

Although POM is readily used by aquatic fungi and bacteria, there is a limited understanding of POM-associated interactions between these taxa, particularly for early-diverging fungal lineages. Using a model ecological system with the chitin-degrading freshwater chytrid fungus Rhizoclosmatium globosum and chitin microbeads, we assessed the impacts of chytrid fungi on POM-associated bacteria. We show that the presence of chytrids on POM alters concomitant bacterial community diversity and structure, including differing responses between chytrid life stages. We propose that chytrids can act as ecosystem facilitators through saprotrophic feeding by producing 'public goods' from POM degradation that modify bacterial POM communities. This study suggests that chytrid fungi have complex ecological roles in aquatic POM degradation not previously considered, including the regulation of bacterial colonization, community succession and subsequent biogeochemical potential.","Roberts, Cordelia; Allen, Ro; Bird, Kimberley E; Cunliffe, Michael",Biol Lett,,394

Patients have been found to have different degrees of response, likely having to do with variable levels of inflammation within the body. Patients who have recovered from the initial infection can develop long-term symptomatology and chronic conditions. Today, we will describe a unique case of a middle aged-healthy man who developed complications of ANCA-associated vasculitis after recovering from a mild COVID-19 infection. Case: A 51-year-old Hispanic male with no previous past medical history presented to the ED with productive sputum and hemoptysis. The patient had previously tested positive for COVID-19 one month prior, but did not require hospitalization. Physical exam findings were significant for diffuse, bilateral lower extremity palpable purpura. Initial workup was significant for CT Chest findings of diffuse patchy consolidations throughout both lungs with cavitary lesions. Additionally, the patient was found to have an acute kidney injury, with Cr 5.80 and GFR less than 10. UA revealed many red blood cells, +1 protein. Nephrology was consulted, started the patient on hemodialysis, and began workup for suspected acute glomerulonephritis (GN). Pulmonology was consulted and began workup for pulmonary renal syndrome in the setting of acute kidney injury with pulmonary disease.Infectious workup results included;a now negative COVID-19, negative Tuberculosis PCR, Respiratory culture revealing yeast. Additional workup revealed;CRP of greater than 200, D-Dimer of 6.41, Fibrinogen of 561. Notably, the patient had decreased complement C3 and C4 levels, negative Anti-GBM antibody, negative Anti-streptolysin O, positive ANCA assay, positive Proteinase antibody, and mildly positive Myeloperoxidase antibody.The patient was subsequently scheduled for renal biopsy to obtain a definitive diagnosis, but this was delayed due to increased INR. The patient's respiratory status worsened during hemodialysis. CTA at that time revealed markedly increased pulmonary infiltrates. The decision was made to intubate the patient, upon which active frank red bleeding arising from the trachea was noted. Shortly after intubation, the patient continued to hemorrhage and sustained 2 cardiac arrests;unfortunately, the patient expired. Discussion: This case is significant because it highlights a unique complication of COVID-19 leading to a possible ANCA-associated vasculitis. Much is to be learned from the Novel Sars-COV-2 virus and suspected complications and this case highlights the importance of keeping a broad differential when treating patients who have recovered from initial infection.","Patel, K.

486337,Predictability: Can the turning point and end of an expanding epidemic be precisely forecast?,2020-04-19,"While the COVID-19 pandemic has spurred intense research and collaborative discovery worldwide, the development of a safe, effective, and targeted antiviral from the ground up is time intensive. Therefore, most antiviral discovery efforts are focused on the re-purposing of clinical stage or approved drugs. While emerging data on drugs undergoing COVID-19 repurpose are intriguing, there is an undeniable need to develop broad-spectrum antivirals to prevent future viral pandemics of unknown origin. The ideal drug to curtail rapid viral spread would be a broad-acting agent with activity against a wide range of viruses. Such a drug would work by modulating host-proteins that are often shared by multiple virus families thereby enabling preemptive drug development and therefore rapid deployment at the onset of an outbreak. Targeting host-pathways and cellular proteins that are hijacked by viruses can potentially offer broad-spectrum targets for the development of future antiviral drugs. Such host-directed antivirals are also likely to offer a higher barrier to the development and selection of drug resistant mutations. Given that most approved antivirals do not target host-proteins, we reinforce the need for the development of such antivirals that can be used in pre- and post-exposure populations.","Chitalia, Vipul C; Munawar, Ali H",J Transl Med,,394

Significant operational challenges were noted at our institution using this approach. In this report, we describe our experience with routine collection of paired URT and LRT sample testing. Our results revealed a high concordance between the two sources, and that all children tested for SARS-CoV-2 were appropriately diagnosed with URT testing alone. There was no added benefit to LRT testing. Based on these findings, our institutional approach was therefore adjusted to sample the URT alone for most patients, with LRT sampling reserved for patients with ongoing clinical suspicion for SARS-CoV-2 after a negative URT test.","Kitt, Eimear; Davis, Daniela H; Kerman, Caryn; Sammons, Julia S; Handy, Lori K; Gallagher, Elizabeth; O039,; Callaghan, Kevin; Harris, Rebecca M; Coffin, Susan E; Bell, Louis M; Chiotos, Kathleen",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,394

METHODS: Retrospective, multicenter, observational study carried out in the 8 Galician tertiary hospitals. All Patients admitted with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia from 1st of March to April 24th, 2020 were included. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed in order to identify the relationship between risk factors, therapeutic interventions and the composite outcome variable. RESULTS: A total of 1292 patients (56.1% male) were included. Two hundred and twenty-five (17.4%) died and 327 (25.3%) reached the main outcome variable. Age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.03 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.04)], CRP quartiles 3 and 4 [OR = 2.24 (95% CI: 1.39-3.63)] and [OR = 3.04 (95% CI: 1.88-4.92)], respectively, Charlson index [OR = 1.16 (95%CI: 1.06-1.26)], SaO2 upon admission [OR = 0.93 (95% CI: 0.91-0.95)], hydroxychloroquine prescription [OR = 0.22 (95%CI: 0.12-0.37)], systemic corticosteroids prescription [OR = 1.99 (95%CI: 1.45-2.75)], and tocilizumab prescription [OR = 3.39 (95%CI: 2.15-5.36)], significantly impacted the outcome. Sensitivity analysis using different alternative logistic regression models identified consistently the ratio admissions/hospital beds as a predictor of the outcome [OR = 1.06 (95% CI: 1.02-1.11)]. CONCLUSION: These findings may help to identify patients at hospital admission with a higher risk of death and may urge healthcare authorities to implement policies aimed at reducing deaths by increasing the availability of hospital beds.","Pérez-de-Llano, Luis; Romay-Lema, Eva María; Baloira-Villar, Adolfo; Anchorena, Christian; Torres-Durán, María Luisa; Sousa, Adrián; Corbacho-Abelaira, Dolores; Paz-Ferrin, José; Diego-Roza, Carmen; Vilariño-Maneiro, Laura; Marcos, Pedro J; Montero-Martínez, Carmen; de la Iglesia-Martínez, Fernando; Riveiro-Blanco, Vanessa; Rodríguez-Núñez, Nuria; Abal-Arca, José; Bustillo-Casado, María; Golpe, Rafael",PLoS One,,394

STAR-Caregivers Virtual Training and Follow-up (STAR-VTF) is adapted from an evidence-based, in-person program that trains family caregivers to manage BPSD. We used a human-centered design approach to obtain feedback from family caregivers about STAR-VTF. The program will be evaluated using a pragmatic randomized trial. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to understand the needs of family caregivers for improving BPSD management and the extent to which caregivers perceived that STAR-VTF could address those needs. METHODS: Between July and September 2019, we conducted 15 semistructured interviews with family caregivers of people with dementia who receive care at Kaiser Permanente Washington in the Seattle metropolitan area. We identified participants from electronic health records, primarily based on a prescription for antipsychotic medication for the person with dementia (a proxy for caregivers dealing with BPSD). We showed caregivers low-fidelity prototypes of STAR-VTF online self-directed materials and verbally described potential design elements. We obtained caregiver feedback on these elements, focusing on their needs and preferences and perceived barriers to using STAR-VTF. We used a hybrid approach of inductive and deductive coding and aggregated codes to develop themes. RESULTS: The idea of a virtual training program for learning to manage BPSD appealed to caregivers. They said health care providers did not provide adequate education in the early disease stages about the personality and behavior symptoms that can affect people with dementia. Caregivers found it unexpected and frustrating when the person with dementia began experiencing BPSD, symptoms they felt unprepared to manage. Accordingly, caregivers expressed a strong desire for the health care organization to offer programs such as STAR-VTF much sooner. Caregivers had already put considerable effort into problem solving challenging behaviors. They anticipated deriving less value from STAR-VTF at that point. Nonetheless, many were interested in the virtual aspect of the training due to the convenience of receiving help from home and the perception that help from a virtual program would be timelier than traditional service modalities (eg, face to face). Given caregivers' limited time, they suggested dividing the STAR-VTF content into chunks to review as time permitted. Caregivers were interested in having a STAR-VTF provider for additional support in managing challenging behaviors. Caregivers reported a preference for having the same coach for the program duration. CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers we interviewed would likely accept a virtual training program such as STAR-VTF to obtain information about BPSD and receive help managing it. Family caregivers anticipated deriving more value if STAR-VTF was offered earlier in the disease course.","Ramirez, Magaly; Duran, Miriana C; Pabiniak, Chester J; Hansen, Kelly E; Kelley, Ann; Ralston, James D; McCurry, Susan M; Teri, Linda; Penfold, Robert B",JMIR Aging,,394

The diagnosis of this tumor is difficult due to the nonspecific and highly variable morphology, yet it is of clinical relevance because of the availability of highly effective TRK inhibitors. In this article, we report the case of a 40-year-old female who presented with a mass in the left calf. Histologic examination revealed a low-grade sarcoma consisting of monomorphic spindle cells accompanied by abundant myxoid stroma, a feature that had not been emphasized in the reported cases of NTRK-rearranged tumors. The tumor cells expressed CD34 and S100 but not SOX10, and they showed positive staining for pan-TRK. Next-generation sequencing showed the presence of LMNA-NTRK1 fusion. The patient developed several episodes of lung metastases that eventually became unresectable. TRK inhibitor was given that led to near-complete resolution of the tumors.","So, Yik Ka; Chow, Chit; To, Ka Fai; Chan, John K C; Cheuk, W",Int J Surg Pathol,,394

As a result, post-lockdown COVID-19 dynamics are heterogeneous and difficult to interpret. We describe a set of contact surveys performed in four Chinese cities (Wuhan, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Changsha) during the pre-pandemic, lockdown and post-lockdown periods to quantify changes in contact patterns. In the post-lockdown period, the mean number of contacts increased by 5 to 17% as compared to the lockdown period. However, it remains three to seven times lower than its pre-pandemic level sufficient to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We find that the impact of school interventions depends nonlinearly on the intensity of other activities. When most community activities are halted, school closure leads to a 77% decrease in the reproduction number; in contrast, when social mixing outside of schools is at pre-pandemic level, school closure leads to a 5% reduction in transmission.","Zhang, Juanjuan; Litvinova, Maria; Liang, Yuxia; Zheng, Wen; Shi, Huilin; Vespignani, Alessandro; Viboud, Cecile; Ajelli, Marco; Yu, Hongjie",Sci.

In 2019, an emerging infectious disease (COVID-19) became a pandemic and resulted in unparalleled public health recommendations (e.g., social distancing, wear masks in public). Aims: The current research examined people's beliefs about how their own compliance to recommendations compared to others and explored the unique associations between social comparisons, worry, risk perceptions, and intentions for health-protective action. Method: An adult sample of US residents (N = 452) completed an online, cross-sectional survey about their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: First, participants reported better-than-average compliance beliefs. Second, comparative beliefs were positively (and uniquely) associated with intentions for future compliance-related behaviors and general risk-reduction behaviors (e.g., information seeking) - particularly for participants who viewed COVID-19 as threatening. Finally, the relation between comparative beliefs and intentions was indirect through worry (but not risk), though alternative models also achieved support. Limitations: Our findings are limited by our use of a cross-sectional design, methodological choices, and our lack of behavioral measures. Conclusions: Overall, results demonstrate that people are attentive to their comparative levels of compliance behaviors during an infectious disease pandemic. Results are discussed in terms of their theoretical implications and the relevance of social comparisons for self-protective action during a pandemic.

491180,Editor’s Introduction,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is a highly contagious disease. To tame the continuously raging outbreak of COVID-19, developing a cheap, rapid and sensitive testing assay is absolutely imperative. Herein, we developed a one-tube colorimetric RT-LAMP assay for the visual detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The assay integrates Si-OH magnetic beads (MBs)-based fast RNA extraction and rapid isothermal amplification in a single tube, thus bypassing the RNA elution step and directly amplifying on-beads RNA molecules with the visualized results. This one-tube assay has a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 200 copies/mL for sample input volumes of up to 600 µL, and can be performed in less than 1 h from sample collection to result readout. This assay demonstrated a 100% concordance with the gold standard test RT-qPCR test by using 29 clinical specimens and showed high specificity. This one-tube colorimetric RT-LAMP assay can serve as an alternative platform for a rapid and sensitive diagnostic test for COVID-19 and is particularly suitable for use at community clinics or township hospitals.","He, Yugan; Xie, Tie; Tong, Yigang",Biosens Bioelectron,,394

Objective To evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on pharmaceutical systems and supply chain in a resource-limited setting. Methods A descriptive qualitative survey using a phenomenological approach was conducted among key informants in the public and private pharmaceutical sectors of Namibia. Data were collected on the perceived impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the supply chain, as well as access and availability of essential medicines among the distributors and points of care in the private and public sectors. Qualitative themes of the impact were analyzed using Tesch's approach. Results Of the 21 key-informants, 57.1% were female and 85% were from the private versus the public pharmaceutical sector. Overall, key informants reported a negative impact on access and availability of essential medicines, particularly sanitation and hygiene products, and antimicrobials. Most medicine outlets, experienced longer lead times, attributed to reduced inter-country transportation of goods and services and limited in-country capacity and capabilities to manufacture. The main thematic challenges included bureaucratic bottlenecks and lack of emergency readiness of the medicine's logistics supply chain in Namibia. Conclusion COVID-19 pandemic aggravated the inequitable access to essential medicines in the public and private sectors of Namibia. Governments in resource-limited countries need to strengthen in-country Private-Public Partnerships as well as regional treaties for Universal Health Coverage in context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tirivangani, Tafadzwa Alpo Bertha Kibuule Dan Gaeseb Johannes Adenuga Babafunso A.",Exploratory Research in Clinical and Social Pharmacy,,394
493778,Research on Multiobjective Location of Urban Emergency Logistics under Major Emergencies,2021,"Objective: Impaired neuropsychological functioning is one possible factor contributing to sexual offending against children. Previous research showed that neuropsychological and especially executive functioning deficits could be related to the two most important risk factors for sexual (re-)offending, namely an antisocial lifestyle and deviant sexual interests. Method: By using a quasi-experimental research design, the present study compared the performance of a sample of men convicted of child sexual abuse (CSA) offenses (n = 70) with men convicted of sexual offenses against adults (n = 49), men convicted of nonsexual offenses (n = 54), and nonoffending men (n = 70) in a set of neuropsychological tests assessing different aspects of executive functioning. Results: All three offending groups had a higher prevalence of brain injury and performed worse compared to nonoffending men on almost all neuropsychological tests. Individuals convicted of CSA offenses showed no differences compared to the other two offending groups. Latent class analyses revealed that a small subset of CSA-offending participants showed most pronounced neuropsychological deficits. These persons also exhibited more intense pedosexual interests but not more indicators of antisociality. Conclusions: The results of the present study indicate that only a certain subset of CSA-offending individuals demonstrates considerable neuropsychological deficits, which seem to correlate with a particularly strong sexual interest in children. This subgroup could also be described as having a particularly high risk concerning sexual reoffending with a sexual abuse offense.

495064,Bibliometric analysis on global research trends of airborne microorganisms in recent ten years (2011-2020),2021,"BACKGROUND: In Pakistan, the prevalence of stunting in children younger than 5 years has remained above global critical levels over the past two decades, with the stunting rate being 40.2% in 2018. Children living in rural areas and in the poorest households suffer the most from stunting across the country-43.2% in rural areas and 51.4% in the lowest wealth quintile. As a continuing public health concern, it is essential that stunting prevention is a national priority in order to ensure human capital development, especially among the poorest households. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of a medium quantity of a lipid-based nutrient supplement (LNS) combined with unconditional cash transfers and social and behavior change communication (SBCC) on reduction of stunting in children aged 6 to 23 months. METHODS: A 5-arm cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted in the district of Rahim Yar Khan in Punjab, Pakistan. The intervention packages will be (1) cash only, (2) cash with LNS, (3) cash with SBCC, and (4) cash with SBCC and LNS. The control arm will receive routine standard of care. We will enroll children at 6 months of age and follow up on a monthly basis up to 24 months of age. A total of 2000 children, 400 in each arm, will be enrolled to detect a 20% reduction in the prevalence of stunting among children aged 24 months. Length, weight, food intake, compliance to interventions, morbidities, and other relevant data will be collected at enrollment and on a monthly basis over the period of 18 months. The process evaluation will assess acceptability of the interventions and potential barriers to implementation through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with the target population and relevant stakeholders. Furthermore, a cost analysis will be conducted to assess the cost-effectiveness of each intervention package. RESULTS: The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Aga Khan University in Pakistan on January 4, 2017. Data collection began in May 2017 and was completed in July 2019. Data analyses are yet to be completed. This study will explore the effectiveness of intervention packages comprised of cash transfers from Benazir Income Support Programme with or without additional LNS and SBCC in preventing childhood stunting. We expect the results to be published in peer-reviewed journals by autumn of 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this trial will provide robust evidence as to which intervention packages can have significant effects on linear growth of children and design effective intervention packages to prevent stunting in children aged 6 to 23 months.

496873,A strategic health initiative: context for Coronavirus,2020,"OBJECTIVE: CT provides rich diagnosis and severity information of COVID-19 in clinical practice. However, there is no computerized tool to automatically delineate COVID-19 infection regions in chest CT scans for quantitative assessment in advanced applications such as severity prediction. The aim of this study is to develop a deep learning (DL) based method for automatic segmentation and quantification of infection regions as well as the entire lungs from chest CT scans. METHODS: The DL-based segmentation method employs the ""VB-Net"" neural network to segment COVID-19 infection regions in CT scans. The developed DL-based segmentation system is trained by CT scans from 249 COVID-19 patients, and further validated by CT scans from other 300 COVID-19 patients. To accelerate the manual delineation of CT scans for training, a human-involved-model-iterations (HIMI) strategy is also adopted to assist radiologists to refine automatic annotation of each training case. To evaluate the performance of the DL-based segmentation system, three metrics, i.e., Dice similarity coefficient, the differences of volume, and percentage of infection (POI), are calculated between automatic and manual segmentations on the validation set. Then, a clinical study on severity prediction is reported based on the quantitative infection assessment. RESULTS: The proposed DL-based segmentation system yielded Dice similarity coefficients of 91.6%±10.0% between automatic and manual segmentations, and a mean POI estimation error of 0.3% for the whole lung on the validation dataset. Moreover, compared with the cases with fully manual delineation that often takes hours, the proposed HIMI training strategy can dramatically reduce the delineation time to 4 minutes after 3 iterations of model updating. Besides, the best accuracy of severity prediction was 73.4%±1.3% when the mass of infection (MOI) of multiple lung lobes and bronchopulmonary segments were used as features for severity prediction, indicating the potential clinical application of our quantification technique on severity prediction. CONCLUSIONS: A DL-based segmentation system has been developed to automatically segment and quantify infection regions in CT scans of COVID-19 patients.

498707,COVID-19 and Black Fungus: Analysis of the Public Perception through Machine Learning,2021,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of a new virus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has now become the main health concern all over the world. Since effective antiviral treatments have not been developed until now, SARS-CoV-2 is severely affecting countries and territories around the world. METHODS: At the present review, articles in PubMed were searched with the following terms: mesenchymal stem cells, exosomes, coronavirus, and SARS-CoV-2, either alone or in a combination form. The most relevant selected functions were mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes and SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 could damage pulmonary cells and induce secretion of different types of inflammatory cytokines. In the following, these cytokines trigger inflammation that damages the lungs and results in lethal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The main characteristic of ARDS is the onset of inflammation in pulmonary, hyaline formation, pulmonary fibrosis, and edema. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (MSC-Exo) are believed to have anti-inflammatory effects and immune-modulating capacity as well as the ability to induce tissue regeneration, suggesting a significant therapeutic opportunity that could be used to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia treatment. Besides, exosomes may serve as a biomarker, drug delivery system, and vaccine for the management of the patient with SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: MSC-Exo may serve as a promising tool in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. However, further work needs to be carried out to confirm the efficacy of exosomes in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.","Akbari, Ali; Rezaie, Jafar",Stem Cell Res Ther,,394

At the moment there is not an available vaccine, so, scientific community is looking for strategies and drugs to implement prevention and prophylaxis. Several compounds are examined for this purpose. Glycyrrhizin, an alkaloid extracted from licorice plant (glycyrriza glabra), is one of the most studied molecules, both for its peculiar biological functions and for its pharmacological effects. This brief review aims to highlight the characteristics of glycyrrhizin for topical use on the nasal and ocular surfaces. The anti-inflammatory activity, the ability to inhibit the accumulation of ROS, the antiviral property, but, above all, the ability to bind the ACE receptor and the SARS - CoV-2 protein S in the extracellular environment make Glycyrrhizzin for topical use a compound with a high prophylactic potential for SARS - CoV - 2 infection, also due to its low cost and the absence of significant side effects.","Passali, D; Ciprandi, G; Damiani, V; De Marco, A M; Cianfrone, F; Passali, F M",J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,,394
499100,Pandemics and Inequality: Perceptions and Preferences for Redistribution,2021,"RATIONALE: Novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an enveloped, non-segmented positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the beta-coronaviridae family. This virus is known to cause severe bilateral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which can lead to difficulty breathing requiring mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit management. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 77-year-old female with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia who presented as a transfer to our hospital facility with worsening fevers, cough, and respiratory distress. DIAGNOSIS: Chest X-rays revealed bilateral infiltrates worse at the lung bases and CT scan of the chest showed bilateral ground-glass opacities consistent with COVID-19. While our testing revealed a negative COVID-19 result at our institution, the result at a previous hospital returned a positive result. INTERVENTIONS: She was being treated aggressively in the intensive care unit with high dose intravenous ascorbic acid, hydroxychloroquine, and anti-interleukin-6 monoclonal antibody. She also received a loading dose of remdesivir however was unable to complete the course due to organ failure and requirement of vasopressors for hemodynamic stability. OUTCOMES: She remained critically ill and was eventually placed on comfort care as per the family's wishes and passed away. LESSONS: With a rapidly growing death rate and more than 200,000 confirmed cases worldwide, COVID-19 has become a global pandemic and major hit to our healthcare systems. While several companies have already begun vaccine trials and healthcare facilities have been using a wide-range of medications to treat the virus and symptoms, there is not yet an approved medication regimen for COVID-19 infections. The alarming increase in cases per day adds additional pressure to find a cure and decrease the global health burden and mortality rate.","Douedi, Steven; Miskoff, Jeffrey",Medicine (Baltimore),,394

Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted which included 38 questions about demography, clinical condition, change of health habits, medical treatments to cardio metabolic patients in outpatient follow-up. A total of 66 researchers from 13 Latin American countries enrolled patients from June 15 to July 15, 2020. The countries were divided into 3 geographic regions Region1 (NCCR) North, Central, and Caribbean Region;Region2 (AR) Andean Region;Region3 (SCR) Southern Cone Region. Isolation measures were estimated from national reports and correlated using the Spearman R coefficient. Design and method: 4216 patients were analyzed, NCCR (33.82%);AR (32.23%) SCR (33.94%). Significant differences were found between regions in the AR, SCR and NCCR, in age, unemployment, CV risk, adherence, percentage of smokers, type of diet and vaccination coverage. This analysis of habitual medication showed, that discontinued medication was greater in AR, reaching almost 30% (1 in 3 patients), to a lesser extent in NCCR and ultimately less in SCR, showing a significant difference between zones (p &lt;0.001). The main finding of this study was the negative impact that restrictive measures have on adherence to medications and physical activity, Rs = 0.84 p=0.0003 and Rs=0.61 p= 0.0032, respectively. Results: Significant differences were found between regions, AR is the most vulnerable region, lower income, lower educational level, higher medication discontinuation. Restrictive measures imposed by the different countries (quarantine) showed a positive correlation with the discontinuation of medication and a negative correlation with the amount of physical activity. The impact of the consequences left by this pandemic will be very profound in most Latin American countries.","Camilletti, J.; Renna, N.; Santi, R. L.; Erriest, J.; Siller, G. P.; Garcia, M.

502026,Near-Real-Time Learner Analysis and Faculty Support During a Transition to Online Education,2021,"BackgroundThe B.1.526 variant (WHO designation: Iota) is a SARS-CoV-2 variant of interest, as classified by both the US CDC and the WHO. Due to a lack of extensive genomic sequencing and contact tracing data, its key epidemiological properties have not been well characterized. MethodsWe utilized nine epidemiological and population datasets collected in New York City (NYC), where B.1.526 emerged, and comprehensive modeling to estimate the changes in transmissibility, immune escape potential, and infection fatality risk (IFR) for B.1.526. FindingsEstimated transmission rate in the neighborhood where B.1.526 was initially detected was consistently higher than other neighborhoods in NYC and further increased during the weeks preceding B.1.526 detection, likely due to its early spread there. Overall, models estimated that B.1.526 had transmissibility about 15-25% higher than previously circulating variants and that it could escape immunity in 0-10% of previously infected persons. In addition, B.1.526 substantially increased IFR in older adults: by 46% (95% CI: 7.4 - 84%) among 45-64 year-olds, 82% (95% CI: 20 - 140%) among 65-74 year-olds, and 62% (95% CI: 45 - 80%) among 75+ during Nov 2020 - Apr 2021, compared to baseline IFR estimated for preexisting variants. InterpretationNew variants like B.1.526 likely spread in the population weeks prior to detection, and partial immune escape (e.g., resistance to therapeutic antibodies) could offset prior medical advances and increase IFR. Early preparedness for and close monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 variants, their epidemiological characteristics, and disease severity are thus crucial to COVID-19 pandemic response as it remains a global public health threat. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for studies published through June 23, 2021 on the B.1.526 (Iota) SARS-CoV-2 variant, using the terms ""B.1.526"", ""Iota variant"" and ""COVID-19"", or ""Iota variant"" and ""SARS-CoV-2"". Our search returned 14 papers, from which we read the abstracts and identified 8 relevant studies. The majority (7 of 8) of these studies focused on identifying the specific mutations, namely L5F, T95I, D253G, additionally E484K or S477N for two different subclades (i.e., B.1.526-S:E484K and B.1.526-S:S477N) and a closely related subclade (i.e., B.1.526-S:L452R or B.1.526.1) as defined by spike mutations D80G, {Delta}144, F157S, L452R, T859N, and D950H; these studies also examined changes in neutralizing ability of convalescent plasma and vaccinee sera (mild reductions by [~]2-4 fold were reported) and changes in neutralizing ability of monoclonal antibodies (substantial reductions for some monoclonal antibodies were reported). Two studies used genomic data from GISAID to estimate the growth rate of B.1.526 during January - March 2021 and reported that it was similar to the Alpha variant (i.e., B.1.1.7), a SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern with around 50% higher transmissibility than preexisting variants. However, an epidemiological study using individual patient data from January 1 to April 5, 2021 reported no increases in secondary attack rate among contacts of B.1.526 cases, compared to non-VOC/VOI variants. This latter study also showed preliminary evidence that B.1.526 did not increase the risk of hospitalization or death, nor of vaccine breakthrough or reinfection. Added value of this studyWe utilized multiple datasets collected in New York City - where B.1.526 emerged - and model-inference methods to reconstruct the transmission dynamics, including the initial emergence of B.1.526 in the fall of 2020. We estimated that B.1.526 had a moderate increase (15-25%) in transmissibility and could escape immunity in 0-10% of previously infected individuals. In addition, B.1.526 substantially increased the infection-fatality risk (IFR) among adults 65 or older by >60% during Nov 2020 - Apr 2021, compared to baseline risk estimated for preexisting variants. Implications of all the available evidenceNew SARS-CoV-2 variants like B.1.526 could increase transmissibility, evade prior immunity, and increase disease severity. Early preparedness for and close monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 variants and their epidemiological characteristics are crucial to COVID-19 pandemic response as it remains a global public health threat.","Yang, Wan; Greene, Sharon; Peterson, Eric R; Li, Wenhui; Mathes, Robert; Graf, Laura; Lall, Ramona; Hughes, Scott; Wang, Jade; Fine, Anne",,,394

502671,Crisis Poison Pills,2021,"PURPOSE: The United States has experienced a surge of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Regardless of the overall increase in the prevalence and mortality, there are disagreements about the consequences of exposure and contracting COVID-19, specifically in rural areas. Rural areas have inherent characteristics that increase their vulnerability to contracting COVID-19. The objective of this study was to investigate the differences in death rates from COVID-19 between urban and rural areas in the United States. METHODS: This study used county-level data. The data set consisted of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths along with county-level demographics. The sample consisted of all counties in the 50 US states and DC. Counties were designated as metropolitan, micropolitan, and rural. A zero-inflated negative binomial regression was used to estimate county-level number of deaths conditional on contracting COVID-19. The study focused on COVID-19-related mortality from February 10, 2020, to June 12, 2020. FINDINGS: After controlling for county-level characteristics, the rate of COVID-19 deaths was 70.3% (P < .001) for rural counties and 53.4% (P < .001) for micropolitan counties, both significantly lower than metropolitan counties during the study time period. CONCLUSION: Over time, rural geography and social isolation may not provide sustainable protection to rural residents from the pandemic. The slow progression provides rural areas additional time and opportunity to learn from the experiences in urban areas that were most affected. Rural areas need to be proactive and develop prevention strategies and response plans to manage and control the spread of COVID-19.","Karim, Saleema A; Chen, Hsueh-Fen",J. rural health,,394

METHODS: The 21 first patients (14 men and 7 women) who recovered from ARDS in context of COVID-19 were referred to VFS just before to maximum 14 days after their discharge from ICU. The swallowing impairments and the physiopathologic mechanism of them were prospectively analyzed by two swallowing experts: one radiologist, and one phoniatrician using penetration-aspiration scale (PAS) score. RESULTS: Nineteen out of 21 presented impairment in their swallowing function. Sixteen patients presented direct penetration or inhalation. All but one were silent. Some stases were also observed in 13 patients. Five patients presented secondary penetration/aspiration, among these inhalations, and all were silent. The most frequent findings are the delayed pharyngeal phase, the reduced propulsion of the tongue root, the posterior oral leaks, the default of laryngeal closure, and the impaired pharyngeal peristaltism. DISCUSSION: The very high prevalence of swallowing disorders with inhalation and the lack of protective reflexes are the main findings. This emphasizes the need of high caution with bedside screening in these patients with severely injured lungs.","Lagier, Aude; Melotte, Evelyne; Poncelet, Mélanie; Remacle, Sarah; Meunier, Paul",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,394

505353,Corona and resource resilience—is efficiency still a desirable goal?: SMF,2020,"PURPOSE: Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the door for SARS-CoV-2, expressed in critical metabolic tissues. So, it is rational that the new virus causes pleiotropic alterations in glucose metabolism, resulting in the complication of pre-existing diabetes's pathophysiology or creating new disease mechanisms. However, it seems that less attention has been paid to this issue. This review aimed to highlight the importance of long-term consequences and pleiotropic alterations in glucose metabolism following COVID-19 and emphasize the need for basic and clinical research in metabolism and endocrinology. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 shifts cellular metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, which leads to a decrease in ATP generation. Together with metabolic imbalance, the impaired immune system elevates the susceptibility of patients with diabetes to this deadly virus. SARS-CoV-2-induced metabolic alterations in immune cells can result in hyper inflammation and a cytokine storm. Metabolic dysfunction may affect therapies against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The effective control of metabolic complications could prove useful therapeutic targets for combating COVID-19. It is also necessary to understand the long-term consequences that will affect patients with diabetes who survived COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Since the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is still mostly unknown, identifying the metabolic mechanisms contributing to its progression is essential to provide specific ways to prevent and improve this dangerous virus's detrimental effects. The findings show that the new virus may induce new-onset diabetes with uncertain metabolic and clinical features, supporting a potential role of COVID-19 in the development of diabetes.","Mahrooz, Abdolkarim; Muscogiuri, Giovanna; Buzzetti, Raffaella; Maddaloni, Ernesto",Endocrine,,394

The authors aim to identify key supply chain strategies and opportunities for theoretical advancement by taking a resilience perspective on temporary supply chain design.Design/methodology/approachFirst, the authors conducted an impact event analysis of product recalls by exploring the RAPEX database and official statements of individual country regulators. Second, the authors conducted an exploratory case study with the Cambridge University Hospitals on Personal Protective Equipment to explore product recall risks, utilising an action research methodology.FindingsAdditional processes, mainly testing, can compensate for the risks that may arise from temporary supply chains, where changes in location and product design are not possible due to the immediate nature of demand caused by COVID-19 pandemic. This finding reflects on the resilience of designing and implementing temporary supply chains from the perspective of product, process and location.Research limitations/implicationsThis paper does not employ an in-depth multiple case study methodology. However, the authors argue that the role of institutional actors in global supply chains and its implications on product safety needs to be empirically studied in order to expand existing supply chain management theories to cover resilience in emerging, mature and temporary supply chain.Practical implicationsManagers can learn from the Cambridge University Hospitals case study that a downstream quality inspection system can be deployed to manage product quality and safety risks where recalls are not an option, such as during critical situations in the COVID-19 pandemic.Social implicationsThe authors’ observations suggest that governments may be socially responsible for implementing rigorous mechanisms to manage product recall risks that compromise consumer safety.Originality/valueThe authors’ study is uniquely designed and studies various specific phenomena of product recalls risks in COVID-19. The unique design features include a dynamic and recent database analysis involving a product, process and location centric perspective complemented with a Cambridge University Hospitals case study.","Schumacher, Roman Glew Rob Tsolakis Naoum Kumar Mukesh",Continuity &amp; Resilience Review,,394

Given that young people are disproportionately disadvantaged by mental illness and will face further challenges from COVID-19, it is crucial that the appropriate mental health care be delivered to them as early as possible. Integrating digital health solutions into mental health service delivery pathways has the potential to greatly increase efficiencies, allowing for the provision of 'right care, first time'. We propose an innovative digital health solution for demand management intended for use by primary youth mental health services, comprised of: 1) a youth mental health model of care (i.e. BMC Youth Model); and 2) a health information technology specifically designed to deliver this model of care (e.g. the InnoWell Platform), as well as an operational protocol of how this solution could be applied to primary youth mental health service delivery processes. By 'flipping' conventional service delivery models of majority in-clinic and minority online-delivered care to a model where online-delivered care is the default, this digital health solution offers a scalable way of delivering quality youth mental health care, both in response to public health crises (such as COVID-19) and ongoingly into the future.","Davenport, Tracey A; Cheng, Vanessa Wan Sze; Iorfino, Frank; Hamilton, Blake; Castaldi, Eva; Burton, Amy; Scott, Elizabeth M; Hickie, Ian B",,,394

(Special Issue:SRLS in A Global Pandemic Environment: Lessons Learned from SARS-COV-2.),2020,"OBJECTIVES: Little is known about how community services and institutional care settings have adapted to providing support since the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim was to explore how these care services have adapted during the pandemic in the UK and are providing care to people living with dementia (PLWD) and carers. METHOD: Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted in June and July 2020 with 16 purposefully sampled unpaid dementia carers. Participants were asked about their experiences of accessing care services since the lockdown, and whether they were beneficial, if accessed at all. RESULTS: Three themes were identified: (1) Impacts of no activities; (2) Difficulties accessing care during the pandemic; (3) Remote vs. face-to-face support. Loss of access to previously enjoyed activities and having had to shield for many PLWD is suggested to have led to severe physical and cognitive deteriorations, advancing the dementia. Where remote support was available, this was helpful to some, but did not replace the benefits of face-to-face support. Where PLWD were residing in a care home, carers had very limited remote access. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to explore the impact on carers both from a community and institutionalised care angle. Few care services have adapted to providing remote support. With the vaccine taking time to be accessible to everyone, it is vital for organisations to work closely with carers and PLWD to adapt services to provide much needed support.","Giebel, Clarissa; Hanna, Kerry; Callaghan, Steve; Cannon, Jacqui; Butchard, Sarah; Shenton, Justine; Komuravelli, Aravind; Limbert, Stan; Tetlow, Hilary; Rogers, Carol; Eley, Ruth; Rajagopal, Manoj; Ward, Kym; Gabbay, Mark",Aging Ment Health,,394

Whole world is staring at the prospect of repeated lockdowns with another wave of COVID-19 predicted to hit the world in September of 2020. The second wave is assumed to be even more destructive with severe impact across much of the world. The only way to defeat this pandemic is to quickly develop a safe and effective vaccine against this raging menace and initiate a global vaccination drive. Our study is an attempt to deploy various computational methods to identify B-cell and T-cell epitopes from the spike surface glycoprotein of SARS-COV-2 which have the novel potential for vaccine development against COVID-19. For this we have taken 8 unique strains with one each from India, China, France, USA, Italy, Australia, Iran and Pakistan. The strain data was extracted from NCBI Database. By analyzing the immune parameters like surface accessibility, antigenicity, variability, conservancy, flexibility, hydrophilicity, allergenicity and toxicity of the conserved sequences of spike glycoprotein using various databases and bioinformatics tools, we identified two potential novel linear (SGTNGTKRFDN and ASVYAWNRK) and one structural B-cell epitope as well as two T-cell epitopes (RLFRKSNLK and IPTNFTISV) which can be used as epitope-based peptide vaccines. Docking simulation assay revealed that above T-cell epitopes have minimum free binding energy and showed strong hydrogen bond interaction which strengthened its potential as being a T-cell epitope for the epitope-based novel vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. This study allows us to claim that B-cell and T-cell epitopes mentioned above provide potential pathways for developing an exploratory vaccine against spike surface glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 with high confidence for the identified strains. We will need to confirm our findings with biological assays.","Singh, Jitender; Malik, Deepti; Raina, Ashvinder",Vaccine,,394

The indirect impact of the pandemic on health care delivery in general and pediatric emergency department (PED) visits in particular has been widely reported. AIMS: To assess the impact of the pandemic and the social restrictions imposed in its wake on PED visits and hospitalization rates in our Israeli medical center. We also sought to track these data in relation to the variation in pandemic severity and social restrictions over time. A comparison of this data with that of the adult emergency department was also performed. METHODS: Data for this study were drawn from the Shaare Zedek Medical Center (SZMC), Jerusalem, Israel computerized databank. The daily number of PED and adult ER visits as well as hospitalizations resulting from these visits during the months January-July during the years 2018, 2019, 2020 were recorded. We compared the risk ratio for hospitalization in 2019 and 2020, as well as the incidence rate ratio. RESULTS: During March and April there was a decrease in PED visits from 4,588 visits in 2019 to 2,527 visits in 2020 (ratio = .551, 95%CI [.52,.58]. Despite the drop in PED visits, the rate of hospitalizations rose with respect to 2019 (Risk Ratio = 1.31, p < .001, 95%CI [1.17,1.47]). Similar but more moderate trends were seen in the adult ED. From May-July 2020, after the lockdown was lifted, PED visits remained 30% below the same time period from 2018 and 2019, while the hospitalization rate returned to its pre-pandemic level. CONCLUSIONS: A significant drop in PED visits is seen to extend well beyond the peak of the pandemic and the lockdown period. This highlights the potential risk of children with serious emergencies becoming casualties of the pandemic by their not being brought to medical attention. Efforts should be made to raise public awareness among parents and other caretakers of children regarding this matter.","Erlichman, Matti; Zalut, Todd; Schwartz, Shepard; Weiser, Giora",PLoS One,,394

515465,The Road to European Digital Sovereignty with Gaia-X and IDSA,2021,"BACKGROUND: Key workers played a pivotal role during the national lockdown in the UK's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although protective measures have been taken, the impact of the pandemic on key workers is yet to be fully elucidated. METHODS: Participants were from four longitudinal age-homogeneous British cohorts (born in 2001, 1990, 1970 and 1958). A web-based survey provided outcome data during the first UK national lockdown (May 2020) on COVID-19 infection status, changes in financial situation, trust in government, conflict with people around, household composition, psychological distress, alcohol consumption, smoking and sleep duration. Generalised linear models with logit link assessed the association between being a key worker and the above outcomes. Adjustment was made for cohort design, non-response, sex, ethnicity, adult socioeconomic position (SEP), childhood SEP, the presence of a chronic illness and receipt of a shielding letter. Meta-analyses were performed across the cohorts. FINDINGS: 13 736 participants were included. During lockdown, being a key worker was associated with increased chances of being infected with COVID-19 (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.68) and experiencing conflict with people around (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.37). However, key workers were less likely to be worse off financially (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.65), to consume more alcohol (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.98) or to smoke more (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.80) during lockdown. Interestingly, being a key worker was not associated with psychological distress (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.05). INTERPRETATION: Being a key worker during the first UK COVID-19 lockdown was a double-edged sword, with both benefits and downsides. The UK government had the basic duty to protect its key workers from SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it may have failed to do so, and there is an urgent need to rectify this in light of the ongoing third wave.","Topriceanu, Constantin-Cristian; Wong, Andrew; Moon, James C; Hughes, Alun D; Chaturvedi, Nishi; Conti, Gabriella; Bann, David; Patalay, Praveetha; Captur, Gabriella",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),,394

The series showcases the potential professional case managers have in support of managing during a crisis such as this global pandemic. Part I discusses reenvisioned roles and responsibilities of case managers and leaders known to address patients' needs during a crisis, with a special focus on telehealth, tele-case management, surge capacity, redeployment, discharge planning, and transitions of care. PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTINGS: Applicable to the various case management practice settings across the continuum of health and human services, especially acute care. FINDINGS CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 global pandemic crisis has brought an unprecedented challenge to professional case managers and health care professionals. It also has provided opportunities for innovation and partnerships within and across health care organizations and the various care settings where patients/support systems access necessary services. Most importantly, it created a renewed interest in telehealth and facilitated a wider adoption of such approach to care delivery than ever before. This pandemic has also increased the use of nontraditional sites of care, most importantly those that operate virtually on electronic networks and health information system technologies such as remote visits, e-visits, virtual care, and tele-monitoring. Undoubtedly, these have provided new opportunities for tele-case management services and roles for professional case managers in the virtual world of health and human service delivery. IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: Professional case managers are integral members of interprofessional health care teams. Their roles are even more necessary during a global pandemic such as COVID-19. The practice of case management will forever change-for the better. The experience of this crisis in health care has brought about ever-lasting implications for case management professionals. It has raised awareness to sites of care never were as popular before, resulting in an increased need and recognition for tele-case management practice and virtual case managers. It has also forced partnerships and collaborations among the diverse contexts of health care organizations (public, private, or both) and other industries, regardless of whether directly involved in the delivery of care or having a support service role. These new and innovative approaches in the provision of care and case management services will without a doubt become routine expectations beyond the current pandemic period. Of special note are the enhanced roles of case managers in discharge planning and transitions of care.","Tahan, Hussein M",Prof. case manag,,394

AIM: The aim of this study was to capture the experience of such a lockdown in Australians living alone, with and without a dog or a cat. METHOD: Three hundred and eighty-four participants completed an online survey evaluating their levels of loneliness, mindfulness and mood. For participants who owned a dog or a cat, a measure of dog/cat interactions was also administered as well as two open-ended questions about how being a pet owner affected their experience of COVID-19 and how COVID-19 affected their pet. RESULTS: Contrary to expectations, cat owners were found to be less mindful than non-owners and pet interactions did not account for levels of loneliness or levels of mindfulness. In line with our expectations, however, stress and depression positively predicted loneliness, while mindfulness and being a dog owner were protective against it. Insights from qualitative responses suggest that this might be due to the fact that dogs encourage a routine which involves getting out of the house and walking, which itself offers opportunities to socialise with other people doing the same thing. CONCLUSION: These findings add to the emerging literature on mental well-being during a lockdown and the unique role that pets play in their owners' experiences.","Oliva, Jessica Lee; Johnston, Kim Louise",Int J Soc Psychiatry,,394
518548,Demographic perspectives in research on global environmental change,2021-02-01,"The most effective way to prevent and control infectious disease outbreak is through vaccines. The increasing use of vaccines has elevated the need to establish new manufacturing strategies. One of the major approaches is cell-based production, which creates a need for high cell density to enable higher cell production levels. This has led to development of the technology of cell carriers, including micro and macro cell carriers. To follow the production process, quantifying the number of cells on these carriers is required, as well as the tracking of their viability and proliferation. However, owing to various carriers' unique structures, tracking the cell's is challenging using current traditional assays that were originally developed for monolayers of adherent cells. The current ""gold standard"" method is counting cell nuclei, separating cells from the carrier, staining with crystal violet, and visually counting under a microscope. This method is tedious and counts both live and dead cells. A few other techniques were developed but were specific to the carrier type and involved specialized equipment. In this study, we describe a broadly ranging method for counting cells on carriers that was developed and employed as part of the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine. The method is based on the Alamar blue dye, a well-known, common marker for cell activity, and was found to be successful in tracking cell adsorption, cell growth, and viability on carriers. No separation of the cells from the carriers is needed, nor is any specialized equipment; the method is simple and rapid and provides comprehensive details necessary for process control of viral vaccine production in cells. This method can be easily implemented in any of a number of cell-based processes and other unique platforms for measuring the growth of encapsulated cells.","Rosen, Osnat; Jayson, Avital; Natan, Niva; Monash, Arik; Girshengorn, Meni; Goldvaser, Michael; Levin, Lilach; Epstein, Eyal",Biotechnol. bioeng,,394

520379,Mapping the Idea of Europe–Cultural Production of Border Imaginaries through Heritage,2021,"Consistent observations report increased severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in overweight men with cardiovascular factors. As the visceral fat possesses an intense immune activity, is involved in metabolic syndrome and is at the crossroad between the intestines, the systemic circulation and the lung, we hypothesized that it plays a major role in severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV2 presents the ability to infect epithelial cells of the respiratory tract as well as the intestinal tract. Several factors may increase intestinal permeability including direct enterocyte damage by SARS-CoV2, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and epithelial ischemia secondary to SARS-CoV2- associated endothelial dysfunction. This increase permeability further leads to translocation of microbial components such as MAMPs (microbial-associated molecular pattern), triggering an inflammatory immune response by TLR-expressing cells of the mesentery fat (mostly macrophages and adipocytes). The pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by the mesentery fat mediates systemic inflammation and aggravate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) through the mesenteric lymph drainage.","Uzzan, Mathieu; Corcos, Olivier; Martin, Jerome C; Treton, Xavier; Bouhnik, Yoram",Med Hypotheses,,394

DESIGN AND SETTING: Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of diagnostic test accuracy We systematically searched for all published evidence on the effectiveness of tests for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus, or antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, up to 4 May 2020, and assessed relevant studies for risks of bias using the QUADAS-2 framework MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measures of diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive value) were the main outcomes of interest We also included studies that reported influence of testing on subsequent patient management, and that reported virus/antibody detection rates where these facilitated comparisons of testing in different settings, different populations or using different sampling methods RESULTS: 38 studies on SARS-CoV-2 virus testing and 25 studies on SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing were identified We identified high or unclear risks of bias in the majority of studies, most commonly as a result of unclear methods of patient selection and test conduct, or because of the use of a reference standard that may not definitively diagnose COVID-19 The majority were in hospital settings, in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection Pooled analysis of 16 studies (3818 patients) estimated a sensitivity of 87 8% (95% CI 81 5% to 92 2%) for an initial reverse-transcriptase PCR test For antibody tests, 10 studies reported diagnostic accuracy outcomes: sensitivity ranged from 18 4% to 96 1% and specificity 88 9% to 100% However, the lack of a true reference standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis makes it challenging to assess the true diagnostic accuracy of these tests Eighteen studies reporting different sampling methods suggest that for virus tests, the type of sample obtained/type of tissue sampled could influence test accuracy Finally, we searched for, but did not identify, any evidence on how any test influences subsequent patient management CONCLUSIONS: Evidence is rapidly emerging on the effectiveness of tests for COVID-19 diagnosis and management, but important uncertainties about their effectiveness and most appropriate application remain Estimates of diagnostic accuracy should be interpreted bearing in mind the absence of a definitive reference standard to diagnose or rule out COVID-19 infection More evidence is needed about the effectiveness of testing outside of hospital settings and in mild or asymptomatic cases Implementation of public health strategies centred on COVID-19 testing provides opportunities to explore these important areas of research","Jarrom, D.; Elston, L.; Washington, J.; Prettyjohns, M.; Cann, K.; Myles, S.; Groves, P.",BMJ Evid Based Med,,394
521516,Back to the Future,2021,"We conducted a systematic review of observational studies to examine the effects of body mass index (BMI) and obesity (BMI &#8805; 30 kg/m2 ) on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched. Sixteen articles were finally included in the meta-analysis, and a random effects model was used. BMI was found to be higher in patients with severe disease than in those with mild or moderate disease (MD 1.6, 95% CI, 0.8-2.4; p = .0002) in China; however, the heterogeneity was high (I2 = 75%). Elevated BMI was associated with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) use (MD 4.1, 95% CI, 2.1-6.1; p < .0001) in Western countries, and this result was consistent across studies (I2 = 0%). Additionally, there were increased odds ratios of IMV use (OR 2.0, 95% CI, 1.4-2.9; p < .0001) and hospitalization (OR 1.4, 95% CI, 1.3-1.60; p < .00001) in patients with obesity. There was no substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 0%). In conclusion, obesity or high BMI increased the risk of hospitalization, severe disease and invasive mechanical ventilation in COVID-19. Physicians must be alert to these early indicators to identify critical patients.","Chang, Tu-Hsuan; Chou, Chia-Ching; Chang, Luan-Yin",Obes Rev,,394
521560,Behavior: How a Global Social Lockdown Unlocks Time for Sleep,2020,"Automated segmentation of hard exudates in colour fundus images is a challenge task due to issues of extreme class imbalance and enormous size variation. This paper aims to tackle these issues and proposes a dual-branch network with dual-sampling modulated Dice loss. It consists of two branches: large hard exudate biased learning branch and small hard exudate biased learning branch. Both of them are responsible for their own duty separately. Furthermore, we propose a dual-sampling modulated Dice loss for the training such that our proposed dual-branch network is able to segment hard exudates in different sizes. In detail, for the first branch, we use a uniform sampler to sample pixels from predicted segmentation mask for Dice loss calculation, which leads to this branch naturally be biased in favour of large hard exudates as Dice loss generates larger cost on misidentification of large hard exudates than small hard exudates. For the second branch, we use a re-balanced sampler to oversample hard exudate pixels and undersample background pixels for loss calculation. In this way, cost on misidentification of small hard exudates is enlarged, which enforces the parameters in the second branch fit small hard exudates well. Considering that large hard exudates are much easier to be correctly identified than small hard exudates, we propose an easy-to-difficult learning strategy by adaptively modulating the losses of two branches. We evaluate our proposed method on two public datasets and results demonstrate that ours achieves state-of-the-art performances.","Liu, Qing; Liu, Haotian; Liang, Yixiong",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.01665v2.pdf,394

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in the frequency of hand washing and hand care, the onset of hand eczema (HE) and risk factors associated with HE since the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Munich in January 2020. MATERIALS & METHODS: All dermatologic outpatients at the university hospital between April 6 and April 19 were asked to complete a structured questionnaire. RESULTS: Data of 512 patients with a median age of 49 years (243 females, 267 males) were analysed. The frequency of hand washing and hand disinfection increased after the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 (p < 0.001, respectively). While symptoms associated with HE were reported by 29.9% (149/499) of patients, the actual diagnosis of HE was reported less frequently by 11.2% (53/473) with a median duration of 120 days. Frequent hand disinfection (p = 0.039), atopic dermatitis (p = 0.006) and young age (p = 0.0499) were identified as risk factors for symptoms of HE. Hand care was performed more frequently during the pandemic than before (p < 0.001). A high frequency of hand care during the pandemic was not significantly associated with symptoms of HE (p = 0.172), but was associated with self-recognition of HE symptoms (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: After the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the frequency of hand hygiene measures increased. A considerably high prevalence of HE symptoms was associated with frequent hand disinfection, atopic dermatitis and young age. Awareness of HE should be raised in order for preventive measures to be taken earlier.","Kendziora, Benjamin; Guertler, Anne; Ständer, Luka; Frey, Surina; French, Lars E; Wollenberg, Andreas; Reinholz, Markus",Eur. j. dermatol,,394
523005,Editorial: Design implications of a global pandemic,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic had a massive impact on the Italian healthcare systems, which became overwhelmed, leading to an increased risk of psychological pressure on ICU workers. The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of distress (anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms), burnout syndrome and resilience in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and to detect potential factors associated with their psychological response. This cross-sectional, survey-based study enrolled 136 healthcare workers assisting COVID-19 patients in the new COVID-19 ward (Intensive Care Unit), at Milano Fiera, Lombardy. Participants completed an online survey that comprised different validated and standardized questionnaires: Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), Resilience Scale for adults (RSA), Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Socio-demographic and work characteristics were also collected. Out of 136 ICU specialists, there were 84 nurses (62%) and 52 physicians (38%). Over half (60%) met the criteria for burnout, with nearly the same percentages among nurses and physicians. Nurses reported significantly higher scores of anxiety and insomnia levels. Forty-five percent of participants reported symptoms of depression (of whom 13.9% in the clinical range) and most of the staff showed moderate to high levels (82.4%) of resilience. The COVID-19 pandemic can have a significant impact on ICU staff. Effective interventions are needed to maintain healthcare professionals' mental health and relieve burnout. Follow-up and tailored procedures should be provided to alleviate the psychological burden in the frontline staff at highest risk.","Stocchetti, Nino; Segre, Giulia; Zanier, Elisa R; Zanetti, Michele; Campi, Rita; Scarpellini, Francesca; Clavenna, Antonio; Bonati, Maurizio",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,394

It would be essential if the risk for preventable comorbidities, such as the common cold, can be reduced or prevented, so that the scarce medical resources and facilities can be focused on COVID-19. PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of two herbal medicines (Jinhaoartemisia antipyretic granules and Huoxiangzhengqi oral liquids) in reducing the risk of the common cold in community-dwelling residents in China during the COVID-19 outbreak. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective open-label, parallel-group, cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT), was conducted in Chengdu, China. METHODS: A total of 22,065 participants from 11 communities were recruited during a period of one month. The trial started on 30 January and participants were followed up till 29 February 2020. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either a five-day herbal medicine therapy plus a reference manual or a reference manual only if they were allocated to the control group. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of patient-reported common cold symptoms. The secondary endpoint was the time in days from the receipt of herbal drugs/reference manual and the occurrence of the common cold symptoms. RESULTS: Use of herbal medicine reduced the risk of the common cold by 89.6% (95% CI, 52.9% to 97.7%) in all community-dwelling residents, and by 94.0% (95% CI, 52.1% to 99.2%) in residents aged between 16 and 59 years old. Sensitivity analyses showed similar results. CONCLUSION: This community-based RCT found that the use of a herbal medicine therapy (Jinhaoartemisia antipyretic granules and Huoxiangzhengqi oral liquids) could significantly reduce the risks of the common cold among community-dwelling residents, suggesting that herbal medicine may be a useful approach for public health intervention to minimize preventable morbidity during COVID-19 outbreak.","Yan, Bohua; Jiang, Zhiwei; Yuan, Jing; Li, Minghui; Zeng, Jieping; Tang, Jianyuan; Lu, Z Kevin; Ding, Hong; Xia, Jielai; Wang, Qiaoling; Wang, Jundong; Xie, Hongyan; Li, Wenyuan; Zhang, Na; Li, Haiyan; Sang, Xiaoya; Wu, Lina; Xiong, Xiaomo; Tang, Shiyun; Li, Yan; Tao, Mengyao; Xie, Chunguang; Yu, Shuguang",Phytomedicine,,394

Nonetheless, there is scanty evidence in regions with a relatively well-controlled outbreak. This study examined the socioeconomic patterning of COVID-19 severity and its effect modification with multimorbidity in Hong Kong. 3074 local COVID-19 cases diagnosed from 5 July to 31 October 2020 were analyzed and followed up until 30 November 2020. Data on residential addresses, socio-demographic background, COVID-19 clinical conditions, and pre-existing chronic diseases of confirmed cases were retrieved from the Centre for Health Protection and the Hospital Authority. Results showed that, despite an independent adverse impact of multimorbidity on COVID-19 severity (aOR = 2.35 [95% CI = 1.72–3.19]), it varied across the socioeconomic ladder, with no significant risk among those living in the wealthiest areas (aOR = 0.80 [0.32–2.02]). Also, no significant association of the area-level income-poverty rate with severe COVID-19 was observed. In conclusion, the socioeconomic patterning of severe COVID-19 was mild in Hong Kong. Nonetheless, socioeconomic position interacted with multimorbidity to determine COVID-19 severity with a mitigated risk among the socioeconomically advantaged. Plausible explanations include the underlying socioeconomic inequalities in chronic disease management and the equity impact of the public-private dual-track healthcare system.","Chung, Gary Ka-Ki; Chan, Siu-Ming; Chan, Yat-Hang; Yip, Terry Cheuk-Fung; Ma, Hon-Ming; Wong, Grace Lai-Hung; Chung, Roger Yat-Nork; Wong, Hung; Wong, Samuel Yeung-Shan; Yeoh, Eng Kiong; Marmot, Michael; Woo, Jean",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34360461/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18158168,394

Registry studies are providing growing evidence on the elevated risk of mortality from COVID‐19 in patients with chronic liver disease, especially in advanced stages. Results may, however, have a selection bias towards severe cases. Limited data is available on COVID‐19 in patients with autoimmune liver disease (AILD). AIM: To perform an online survey to capture the prevalence of COVID‐19 and the state of medical care of patients with AILD in Europe during the pandemic. METHODS: Data was collected via an anonymous patient‐oriented, online survey, which was available on the EUSurvey platform in nine European languages between 24(th) June 2020 and 14(th) October 2020. Of 1834 contributions, 51 were excluded because participants did not name an underlying AILD, and four were excluded because of duplicate data entry. RESULTS: Of 1,779 participants, 1,752 resided in 20 different countries of the European Union and the United Kingdom (UK). The five countries with the highest numbers of contributions were France (n = 450), Germany (n = 318), the Netherlands (n = 267), Spain (n = 225), and the UK (n = 183). 2.2% of participants (39/1779) had been diagnosed with COVID‐19. There were no differences regarding age, sex, AILD, the status of liver cirrhosis, or status post liver transplantation between COVID‐19 and non‐COVID‐19 cases. Of the 39 COVID‐19 cases, five patients were admitted to a regular ward, one patient was admitted to ICU and required ventilation. CONCLUSION: In our Europe‐wide, patient‐oriented survey on COVID‐19 in patients with AILD, we detected a low rate of COVID‐19, comparable to the period prevalence of the general population. These results suggest that patients with AILD are not at elevated risk of COVID‐19.","Zecher, Britta Franziska; Buescher, Gustav; Willemse, José; Walmsley, Martine; Taylor, Alison; Leburgue, Angela; Schramm, Christoph; Lohse, Ansgar W.; Sebode, Marcial",United European Gastroenterol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34105883/; https://doi.org/10.1002/ueg2.12100,394

Paramyxoviruses are believed to contain a single fusion peptide at the N terminus of the F1 protein. However, here we identified an additional internal segment in the Sendai virus F1 protein (amino acids 214–226) highly homologous to the fusion peptides of HIV-1 and RSV. A synthetic peptide, which includes this region, was found to induce membrane fusion of large unilamellar vesicles, at concentrations where the known N-terminal fusion peptide is not effective. A scrambled peptide as well as several peptides from other regions of the F1 protein, which strongly bind to membranes, are not fusogenic. The functional and structural characterization of this active segment suggest that the F1 protein has an additional internal fusion peptide that could participate in the actual fusion event. The presence of homologous regions in other members of the same family suggests that the concerted action of two fusion peptides, one N-terminal and the other internal, is a general feature of paramyxoviruses.","Peisajovich, Sergio Gerardo; Samuel, Orit; Shai, Yechiel",J Mol Biol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283600935435; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283600935435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10698638/,394

SW0123 is easy to produce using a large-scale microfluidics-based apparatus. The unique core–shell structured nanoparticle facilitates vaccine uptake and demonstrates a high colloidal stability, and a desirable biodistribution pattern with low liver targeting effect upon intramuscular administration. Extensive evaluations in mice and nonhuman primates revealed strong immunogenicity of SW0123, represented by induction of Th1-polarized T cell responses and high levels of antibodies that were capable of neutralizing not only the wild-type SARS-CoV-2, but also a panel of variants including D614G and N501Y variants. In addition, SW0123 conferred effective protection in both mice and non-human primates upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

However, the specific characteristics of these at-risk populations are still not known and approaches to lower mortality are lacking. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective electronic health record data analysis of 25,326 subjects tested for COVID-19 between 2/25/20 and 6/22/20 at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital, a tertiary health care center in the racially diverse Southern U.S. The primary outcome was mortality in COVID-19-positive subjects and the association with subject characteristics and comorbidities was analyzed using simple and multiple linear logistic regression. RESULTS: The odds ratio of contracting COVID-19 was disproportionately high in Blacks/African-Americans (OR 2.6; 95% CI 2.19–3.10; p<0.0001) and in subjects with obesity (OR 1.93; 95% CI 1.64–2.28; p<0.0001), hypertension (OR 2.46; 95% CI 2.07–2.93; p<0.0001), and diabetes (OR 2.11; 95% CI 1.78–2.48; p<0.0001). Diabetes was also associated with a dramatic increase in mortality (OR 3.62; 95% CI 2.11–6.2; p<0.0001) and emerged as an independent risk factor in this diverse population even after correcting for age, race, sex, obesity, and hypertension. Interestingly, we found that metformin treatment prior to diagnosis of COVID-19 was independently associated with a significant reduction in mortality in subjects with diabetes and COVID-19 (OR 0.33; 95% CI 0.13–0.84; p=0.0210). CONCLUSION: Thus, these results suggest that while diabetes is an independent risk factor for COVID-19-related mortality, this risk is dramatically reduced in subjects taking metformin prior to diagnosis of COVID-19, raising the possibility that metformin may provide a protective approach in this high risk population.","Crouse, Andrew B.; Grimes, Tiffany; Li, Peng; Might, Matthew; Ovalle, Fernando; Shalev, Anath",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33519709/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2020.600439,394

METHODS: We searched PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar from December 2019 to June 2021 for retrieving articles studying association between vitamin D deficiency with COVID-19. Qualitative details were synthesized in evidence table and quantitative data was used for deriving pooled estimate through meta-analysis. RESULTS: After initial search of 2261 articles, eight eligible studies (two reviews) were included in the systematic review. Meta-analysis of the quantitative data (six studies) showed pooled prevalence of vitamin D deficiency as 45.91% (95% CI : 25.148-67.450). In infected pediatric patients, low levels of vitamin D increased the risk of severe disease (odds ratio - 5.5; 95% CI : 1.560- 19.515; p = 0.008). It was also found that children and adolescents having vitamin D deficiency had greater risk of COVID infection as compared to patients with normal vitamin D levels. Improvement in disease severity with vitamin D supplementation was also noted. CONCLUSION: The systematic review showed that almost half of the pediatric COVID patients suffer from vitamin D deficiency. It is also clear that the low level of vitamin D is associated with greater risk of infection and poorer outcome in pediatrics.","Shah, Komal; V P, Varna; Pandya, Apurvakumar; Saxena, Deepak",QJM,https://doi.org/10.1093/qjmed/hcab202; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34293161/,394

594190,Guest Editorial.,2021-02-11,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome remains the main cause of death among people with COVID-19. Although many immunomodulatory and antiviral drug therapies have been tested, the only effective therapy against severe COVID-19 pneumonia among the general population is a regimen of high-dose corticosteroids for cases of severe associated inflammation. In solid-organ transplant recipients with long-term immunosuppression, data on disease presentation and evolution are scarce, and the benefit of high-dose corticosteroids remains uncertain for cases of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Here, we report 2 cases of COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome that occurred in lung transplant recipients in March and April 2020, respectively. Both cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome occurred in patients with long-term azithromycin treatment prescribed to prevent chronic allograft dysfunction. Acute respiratory distress syndrome was associated with severe inflammation and was cured after early administration of high-dose corticosteroids in both cases, with progressive and complete resolution of lung lesions evidenced on thoracic computed tomography scan. Our findings support the benefit of early high-dose corticosteroids in COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome with hyperinflammation in patients with long-term immunosuppression such as lung transplant recipients.","Brugiere, Olivier; Neuville, Mathilde; Le Balch, Pierre; Le Tulzo, Yves; Brun, Anne-Laure; Hamid, Abdulmonem; Beaumont, Laurence; Roux, Antoine; Jouneau, Stéphane; Parquin, François",Exp Clin Transplant,https://doi.org/10.6002/ect.2021.0007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34085913/,394
597185,Psychological Aspects of Students With Learning Disabilities in E-Environments: A Mini Review and Future Research Directions,2021-01-07,"Oxidative stress is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases. Accumulating evidence has shown that oxidative stress is characterized by the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Previous reviews have highlighted inflammatory signaling pathways, biomarkers, molecular targets, and pathogenetic functions mediated by oxidative stress in various diseases. The inflammatory signaling cascades are initiated through the recognition of host cell-derived damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and microorganism-derived pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). In this review, the effects of PRRs from the Toll-like (TLRs), the retinoic acid-induced gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) and the NOD-like (NLRs) families, and the activation of these signaling pathways in regulating the production of ROS and/or oxidative stress are summarized. Furthermore, important directions for future studies, especially for pathogen-induced signaling pathways through oxidative stress are also reviewed. The present review will highlight potential therapeutic strategies relevant to inflammatory diseases based on the correlations between ROS regulation and PRRs-mediated signaling pathways.","Li, Pengwei; Chang, Mingxian",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22147688; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34299310/,394

Although a number of studies have been published on the topic already, there has not been a critical review of studies on the impacts of COVID-19 by and on environmental factors. The current study fills this gap by presenting a critical analysis of 57 studies on the nexus between COVID-19 and the environment, published in nine journals up to May 2020. Majority of the studies in our sample are published in Science of the Total Environment (74%), and studies used mostly descriptive statistics and regression as research methods. We identified four underlying research clusters based on a systematic content analysis of the studies. The clusters are: (1) COVID-19 and environmental degradation, (2) COVID-19 and air pollution, (3) COVID-19 and climate/metrological factors and (4) COVID-19 and temperature. Besides a critical analysis of the studies in each cluster, we propose research questions to guide future research on the relationship between COVID-19 and the environment.","Shakil, Mohammad Hassan; Munim, Ziaul Haque; Tasnia, Mashiyat; Sarowar, Shahin",Sci Total Environ,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720345514?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32711074/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720345514,394

This study aims to estimate the prevalence of face mask usage and investigate about different types of face mask and their distribution among pedestrians in southwest Iran during the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in August 2020 in Ahvaz, southwest Iran. Using a multistage sampling method, a total of 10,440 pedestrians selected from 8 urban districts and 92 neighborhoods of the city. The data gathered by observation method. Percentage, mean and standard deviation were used to describe the variables. Chi-square test, fisher exact test and Chi-square for trend used to assess relationship between two categorical variables. We used unconditional logistic regression model to control confounders. RESULTS: The most common age group was 10 to 39 years and 67.9% of the participants were male. The overall prevalence of face mask usage was 45.6% (95% CI, 44.6–46.5). In general, as the age increased, the prevalence of face mask use significantly increased (p for trend < 0.001). Women used face masks significantly higher than men (60.2% vs. 38.7%, p < 0.001). Among the pedestrians who used the mask, 75.6% wore facemask correctly. The most common type of facemask used by the pedestrians were surgical (medical) masks (63.8%). In total, the prevalence of facemask usage was significantly higher during a.m. (49.4%) compared to p.m. (43.9%), (p < 0.001). Besides, in our study, 1.7 and 0.3% of Pedestrians had worn gloves and shielded respectively. Women used shields and gloves significantly higher than men (3.6% vs. 0.7%, p < 0.001). Also, women used shields more than men (0.5% vs. 0.3%, p = 0.036). CONCLUSION: We concluded that the prevalence rate of face mask use in Ahvaz was fairly low especially in men and younger people. Hence, the observed rates probably cannot protect the community against COVID-19 spread. Therefore, it is important to implement educational programs as well as to establish laws and regulations governing the use of face masks in public places.","Rahimi, Zahra; Shirali, Gholam Abbas; Araban, Marzieh; Mohammadi, Mohammad javad; Cheraghian, Bahman",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33446172/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-10152-2,394

Le confinement peut désorganiser le sommeil en impactant, d’une part, les rythmes circadiens par une diminution de l’intensité des synchroniseurs extérieurs et, d’autre part, peut favoriser l’insomnie dans cette période de stress aigu. Enfin, le confinement peut être source d’une privation de sommeil chez ceux qui sont en première ligne et qui gèrent la crise. De plus, chez les enfants/adolescents le confinement peut également déstructurer les journées et ainsi avoir un impact sur la santé en générale. Pour cela, il est important de mettre en place certaines stratégies de préventions de ces perturbations de sommeil afin d’atténuer l’impact psychologique, infectieux et faire face de manière optimale à cette situation que nous vivons tous. Summary In addition to the psychological impact of quarantine, there are sleep disturbances that must be taken into account by implementing appropriate strategies in order to maintain good mental and general health. Quarantine can disrupt sleep first in impacting circadian rhythms by decreasing the intensity of zeitgebers, second can promote insomnia in this period of acute stress and third can be a source of sleep deprivation in those on the front line and managing the crisis. In addition, in children/adolescents, confinement can also destructure the days and thus have an impact on overall health. For this, it is important to put in place strategies to prevent these sleep disturbances in order to reduce the psychological, infectious impact and deal optimally with this situation that we are all experiencing.","Guichard, K.; Geoffroy, P.

Past pandemics have been linked to increases in suicide risk, but little is known about how suicide risk relates to COVID-19 symptoms or hospitalizations. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Fall cohort of the 2020-2021 Healthy Minds Study, a cross-sectional, web-based survey of undergraduate and graduate students in the U.S. (N = 16,315). Logistic regression was used to test for associations between COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and symptoms severity, and suicide-related outcomes. RESULTS: Suicidal ideation was reported by n = 2190 (13.4%), plans by n = 885 (5.4%), and attempts by n = 209 (1.3%). The prevalence of each suicide-related outcome measure was greater among those reporting COVID-19 symptoms/diagnosis and among those with greater COVID-19 symptom severity, with a drastically greater prevalence of suicide attempts among those who were hospitalized for COVID-19, odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 9.43 (3.87-22.95). Among respondents with suicidal ideation, 53.8% of those hospitalized for COVID-19 also made a suicide attempt, compared to 8.9% of non-infected respondents with past-year ideation. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include the use of cross-sectional data and retrospective self-report measures, which may be subject to recall biases. The response rate was low but typical of online surveys conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization for COVID-19 may be an underestimated risk factor for suicide attempts. While mechanisms remain unclear, these data suggest that college students hospitalized for COVID should be screened for suicidal thoughts and behaviors subsequent to discharge, particularly if they have pre-existing suicidal ideation.","DeVylder, Jordan; Zhou, Sasha; Oh, Hans",J Affect Disord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34303303/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165032721007370; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032721007370; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.07.058,394

The quantification of COVID-19 transmissibility is desired for purposes of assessing the potential for a place to start an outbreak and the extent of transmission in the absence of control measures. It is well known that the transmissibility can be measured by reproduction number. For this reason, the large amount of research focuses on the estimations of reproduction number of COVID-19. However, these previous results are controversial and even misleading. To alleviate this problem, Liu et al advised to use averaging technique. Unfortunately, the fluctuant consequence principally arises from data error or model limitations rather than stochastic noise, where the averaging technique doesn't work well.

607117,Teaching Antenatal Counseling Skills via Video Conference,2021-08-09,"Expression of the Gag-Pol polyprotein of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) requires a −1 ribosomal frameshifting event at the overlap region of the gag and pol open reading frames. The signal for frameshifting is composed of two essential mRNA elements; a slippery sequence (AAAUUUA) where the ribosome changes reading frame, and a stimulatory RNA structure located immediately downstream. This RNA is predicted to be a complex stem-loop but may also form an RNA pseudoknot. We have investigated the structure of the RSV frameshift signal by a combination of enzymatic and chemical structure probing and site-directed mutagenesis. The stimulatory RNA is indeed a complex stem-loop with a long stable stem and two additional stem-loops contained as substructures within the main loop region. The substructures are not however required for frameshifting. Evidence for an additional interaction between a stretch of nucleotides in the main loop and a region downstream to generate an RNA pseudoknot was obtained from an analysis of the frameshifting properties of RSV mutants translated in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro translation system. Mutations that disrupted the predicted pseudoknot-forming sequences reduced frameshifting but when the mutations were combined and should re-form the pseudoknot, frameshifting was restored to a level approaching that of the wild-type construct. It was also observed that the predicted pseudoknot-forming regions had reduced sensitivity to cleavage by the single-stranded probe imidazole. Overall, however, the structure probing data indicate that the pseudoknot interaction is weak and may form transiently. In comparison to other characterised RNA structures present at viral frameshift signals, the RSV stimulator falls into a novel group. It cannot be considered to be a simple hairpin-loop yet it is distinct from other well characterised frameshift-inducing RNA pseudoknots in that the overall contribution of the RSV pseudoknot to frameshifting is less dramatic.","Marczinke, Beate; Fisher, Rosamond; Vidakovic, Marijana; Bloys, Alison J; Brierley, Ian",J Mol Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9813113/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283698921866; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283698921866,394

This study investigated the transmissibility and death distribution of COVID-19 and its association with meteorological parameters to study the propagation pattern of COVID-19 in UK regions. We used the reported case and death per capita rate (as of November 13, 2020; before mass vaccination) and long-term meteorological data (temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and visibility) in 406 UK local authority levels based on publicity available secondary data. We performed correlation and regression analysis between COVID-19 variables and meteorological parameters to find the association between COVID-19 and independent variables. Student’s T and Mann–Whitney’s tests were used to analyze data. The correlation and regression analyses revealed that temperature, dew point, wind speed, and humidity were the most important factors associated with spread and death of COVID-19 (P <0.05). COVID-19 cases negatively correlated with humidity in areas with high population density, but the inverse in low population density areas. Wind speeds in low visibility areas, which are considered polluted air, may increase the spread of disease (r=0.42, P <0.05) and decrease the spread in high visibility areas (r=−0.16, P <0.05). Among low (T <10°C) and high (T >10°C) temperature areas, the average incidence rates were 2056.86 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1909.49–2204.23) and 1446.76 (95% CI: 1296.71–1596.81). Also, COVID-19 death per capita rates were 81.55 (95% CI: 77.40–85.70) and 69.78 (95% CI: 64.39–75.16) respectively. According to the comprehensive analysis, the spread of disease will be suppressed as the weather warms and humidity and wind speed decrease.

On-site source data verification (SDV) in the multicenter clinical trial became difficult due to travel ban and social distancing. For multicenter clinical trials, centralized data monitoring is an efficient and cost-effective method of data monitoring. Centralized data monitoring reduces the risk of COVID-19 infections and provides additional capabilities compared to on-site monitoring. The key steps for on-site monitoring include identifying key risk factors and thresholds for the risk factors, developing a monitoring plan, following up the risk factors, and providing a management plan to mitigate the risk. METHODS: For analysis purposes, we simulated data similar to our clinical trial data. We classified the data monitoring process into two groups, such as the Supervised analysis process, to follow each patient remotely by creating a dashboard and an Unsupervised analysis process to identify data discrepancy, data error, or data fraud. We conducted several risk-based statistical analysis techniques to avoid on-site source data verification to reduce time and cost, followed up with each patient remotely to maintain social distancing, and created a centralized data monitoring dashboard to ensure patient safety and maintain the data quality. CONCLUSION: Data monitoring in clinical trials is a mandatory process. A risk-based centralized data review process is cost-effective and helpful to ignore on-site data monitoring at the time of the pandemic. We summarized how different statistical methods could be implemented and explained in SAS to identify various data error or fabrication issues in multicenter clinical trials.","Afroz, Most Alina; Schwarber, Grant; Bhuiyan, Mohammad Alfrad Nobel",Contemp Clin Trials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cct.2021.106368; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33775899/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S155171442100104X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S155171442100104X,394

Using Bayesian inference, we have estimated critical epidemiological determinants. The estimated mean incubation period was 5.3 days (95% CI 4.2–6.8 days), mean time to hospitalisation was 3.5 days (95% CI 2.8–3.6 days), mean time from symptom onset to recovery was 26 days (95% CI 25–27 days) and mean time from symptom onset to death was 21 days (95% CI 16–26 days). The reproduction ratio was estimated to be 4.8 (95% CI 2.2–8.8) in the early part of the epidemic (February and March 2003) reducing to 0.75 (95% CI 0.65–0.85) in the later part of the epidemic (April and May 2003). The infectivity of symptomatic SARS cases in hospital and in the community was estimated. Community SARS cases caused transmission to others at an estimated rate of 0.4 per infective per day during the early part of the epidemic, reducing to 0.2 in the later part of the epidemic. For hospitalised patients, the daily infectivity was approximately 0.15 early in the epidemic, but fell to 0.0006 in the later part of the epidemic. Despite the lower daily infectivity level for hospitalised patients, the long duration of the hospitalisation led to a greater number of transmissions within hospitals compared with the community in the early part of the epidemic, as estimated by this study. This study investigated the individual infectivity profile during the symptomatic period, with an estimated peak infectivity on the ninth symptomatic day.","McBryde, E. S.; Gibson, G.; Pettitt, A.

Such a response of the patient’s immune system may reflect (1) the dysregulation of the immune response or (2) it may be an attempt to regulate itself in situations where the non-infectious self poses a greater threat than the infectious non-self. Of significance may be the primary virus-host cell interaction where the surface-bound ACE2 ectoenzyme plays a critical role.

People who were born preterm may be at greater risk for COVID-19 because their early exposure to oxygen (hyperoxia) at birth increases the severity of respiratory viral infections. Hyperoxia at birth increases the severity of influenza A virus infections in adult mice by reducing the number of alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells. Since AT2 cells express the SARS-CoV-2 receptors angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) and transmembrane protease/serine subfamily member 2 (TMPRSS2), their expression should decline as AT2 cells are depleted by hyperoxia. Instead, ACE2 was detected in airway Club cells and endothelial cells at birth, and then AT2 cells at one year of age. Neonatal hyperoxia stimulated expression of ACE2 in Club cells and in AT2 cells by 2 months of age. It also stimulated expression of TMPRSS2 in the lung. Increased expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors was blocked by mitoTEMPO, a mitochondrial superoxide scavenger that reduced oxidative stress and DNA damage seen in oxygen-exposed mice. Our finding that hyperoxia enhances the age-dependent expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors in mice helps explain why COVID-19 lung disease is greater in the elderly and people with pre-existing co-morbidities.","Yee, Min; David Cohen, E.; Haak, Jeannie; Dylag, Andrew M.; O’Reilly, Michael A.",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-79595-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33372179/,394

The assessment was also forward-looking, asking what aspects of rights-based family planning still need attention moving from 2020 to 2030. METHODS: This paper draws on interviews with 23 key informants from governments, civil society, and youth focused organizations, implementing partners, and bi-lateral and multilateral organizations from Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Europe and North America, all working on family planning and engaged in various roles with the FP2020 partnership at global and national levels, along with documentation of FP2030 partnership plans. The interviews were conducted as part of the assessment and included questions to respondents for their recommendations on rights-based family planning moving towards 2030. RESULTS: Respondents agreed that rights should be at the center of the vision for family planning, with attention to rights literacy, accountability and equity, including adolescent and youth leadership. They noted the need for consistent political and financial support, and incorporating rights into result-based financing programming. While respondents noted the need for development and dissemination of practical tools and training materials, along with rights metrics and implementation research, they stressed the importance of focusing work on rights at the country level. Respondents also acknowledged that institutionalizing rights-based family planning will require enhanced commitment and funding from both donors and countries to ensure programming – and success – over the long term. Amplifying civil society and particularly adolescent and youth voices will be key to engaging governments to support both rights-based programming and provide funding. Review of initial planning under FP2030 related to each of the recommendations suggests that the new partnership is seeking to addressing each of them. DISCUSSION: As the family planning field looks beyond 2020 to 2030, this paper provides a roadmap for building on the gains made over the past decade to effectively tackle the challenges remaining to ensure that programming to achieve the vision of the FP2030 Partnership is rights-based.","Hardee, Karen; Jordan, Sandra",Open Access J Contracept,https://doi.org/10.2147/oajc.s324678; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34531690/,394

The principal challenges and mitigating approaches have focussed on the delivery of material online, but given the practical and professional outcomes required of veterinary graduates, innovative ways to provide some in person teaching have been sought also. ABSTRACT: The public health implications of the Covid-19 pandemic have caused unprecedented and unexpected challenges for veterinary schools worldwide. They are grappling with a wide range of issues to ensure that students can be trained and assessed appropriately, despite the international, national, and local restrictions placed on them. Moving the delivery of knowledge content largely online will have had a positive and/or negative impact on veterinary student learning gain which is yet to be clarified. Workplace learning is particularly problematic in the current climate, which is concerning for graduates who need to develop, and then demonstrate, practical core competences. Means to optimise the learning outcomes in a hybrid model of curriculum delivery are suggested. Specific approaches could include the use of video, group discussion, simulation and role play, peer to peer and interprofessional education.","Routh, Jennifer; Paramasivam, Sharmini Julita; Cockcroft, Peter; Nadarajah, Vishna Devi; Jeevaratnam, Kamalan",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34207202/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11061818,394

620371,Mitigation of emerging implications of climate change on food production systems,2020-04-23,"We have developed real-time PCR systems to quantitate feline cytokine gene expression. The method is based on the cleavage of fluorescent dye-labelled probes by the 5′–3′ exonuclease activity of the Taq DNA polymerase during PCR and measurement of fluorescence intensity by a Sequence Detection System. The feline-specific TaqMan probes were designed to encompass an intron, thus allowing differentiation of complementary DNA versus genomic DNA amplification products. Quantitative analysis of cytokine cDNA concentrations was performed in comparison to feline GAPDH. Messenger RNA (mRNA) from the universally expressed housekeeping gene GAPDH proved to be useful as an amplification control and allowed for correction of variations in the efficiencies of RNA extraction and reverse transcription. GAPDH mRNAs were readily detectable in cDNAs prepared from unstimulated feline peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and from frozen cell pellets, while cytokines (Interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, IL-12 p35, IL-12 p40, IFNγ, IL-16) were expressed at variable amounts. IFNγ transcription was found to be upregulated in stimulated PBMCs and feline cell lines. The synthesis of cDNA and the performance of the PCR in separate tubes proved to be of superior sensitivity compared to a single-tube based system. The assays described are highly reproducible, require no post-PCR manipulation of the amplicons and permit the analysis of several hundred PCR reactions per day. With this method it is possible to detect and quantify cytokine mRNA expression reliably in small amounts of cells even after storage of samples for at least 5 years.","Leutenegger, Christian M; Mislin, Caroline N; Sigrist, Brigitte; Ehrengruber, Markus U; Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina; Lutz, Hans",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10587308/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242799001002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242799001002,394

620688,Machine Learning Approaches in COVID-19 Survival Analysis and Discharge Time Likelihood Prediction using Clinical Data,2020-07-04,"Evolutionary biologists and disease biologists use the terms strain and adaptation in Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) research in different ways. In evolutionary biology, a strain is a nascent genetic lineage that can be described by a genealogy, and a phylogenetic nomenclature constructed to reflect that genealogy. Prion strains are described as showing distinct host range, clinical presentation, disease progression, and neuropathological and PrP biochemical profiles, and lack information that would permit phylogenetic reconstruction of their history. Prion strains are alternative protein conformations, sometimes derived from the same genotype. I suggest referring to prion strains as ecotypes, because the variant phenotypic conformations (“strains”) are a function of the interaction between PRNP amino acid genotype and the host environment. In the case of CWD, a prion ecotype in white-tailed deer would be described by its genotype and the host in which it occurs, such as the H95 + ecotype. However, an evolutionary nomenclature is difficult because not all individuals with the same PRNP genotype show signs of CWD, therefore creating a nomenclature reflecting and one-to-one relationship between PRNP genealogy and CWD presence is difficult. Furthermore, very little information exists on the phylogenetic distribution of CWD ecotypes in wild deer populations. Adaptation has a clear meaning in evolutionary biology, the differential survival and reproduction of individual genotypes. If a new prion ecotype arises in a particular host and kills more hosts or kills at an earlier age, it is the antithesis of the evolutionary definition of adaptation. However, prion strains might be transmitted across generations epigenetically, but whether this represents adaptation depends on the fitness consequences of the strain. Protein phenotypes of PRNP that cause transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), and CWD, are maladaptive and would not be propagated genetically or epigenetically via a process consistent with an evolutionary view of adaptation. I suggest terming the process of prion strain origination “phenotypic transformation”, and only adaptation if evidence shows they are not maladaptive and persist over evolutionary time periods (e.g., thousands of generations) and across distinct species boundaries (via inheritance). Thus, prion biologists use strain and adaptation, historically evolutionary terms, in quite different ways.","Zink, Robert M.",Heliyon,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06801; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33898853/,394

The potential for cross transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in faeces and urine has led global healthcare providers to examine different infection prevention and control practices not least the management and disposal of human excreta. There are two major systems in place to undertake this; one being the use of re-usable bedpans and urinals with reprocessing in a washer disinfectors (WD). The other is use of disposable system; either with pulp bedpans and urinals disposed of in a macerator or hygienic bags disposed of as waste. A review of the literature provided limited evidence to explore these different methods; both having pros and cons with regards to the environmental aspects as well as the infection prevention and control implications. Manual cleaning can pose associated infection risks to both staff and patients. Disinfection of re-usable bedpans may not achieve the level of disinfection required. Disposable systems offer an alternative that can overcome some of the infection prevention and control limitations of washer disinfectors.

Objective To assess AT1R and ETAR auto-antibodies in COVID19 patients and controls, and explore their association with disease course. METHODS: 65 hospitalized patients with COVID19 infection were included. Clinical and laboratory findings were retrospectively assessed. Patients with unfavorable disease course, admitted at the intensive care unit and/or deceased during hospital admission (n=33) were compared to admitted COVID19 patients with favorable disease course (n=32). The presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and auto-antibodies against AT1R or ETAR in peripheral blood were compared between COVID19 with unfavorable and favorable disease course and age matched controls (n=20). RESULTS: The presence of ANA was not significantly different between COVID19 patients with unfavorable (n=7/33; 21%) and favorable disease course (n=6/32; 19%) (p= 0.804) and controls (n=3/20; 15%). Auto-antibodies against AT1R were significantly increased in unfavorable disease course (median 14.59 U/mL, IQR 11.28 – 19.89) compared to favorable disease course (median 10.67 U/mL, IQR 8.55 – 13.0, p< 0.01).

Preparedness plans based on lessons learned from past epidemics can guide behavioral and pharmacological interventions to contain and treat emergent diseases. Although conventional biologics production systems can meet the pharmaceutical needs of a community at homeostasis, the COVID-19 pandemic has created an abrupt rise in demand for vaccines and therapeutics that highlight the gaps in this supply chain’s ability to quickly develop and produce biologics in emergency situations given a short lead time. Considering the projected requirements for COVID-19 vaccines and the necessity for expedited large scale manufacture the capabilities of current biologics production systems should be surveyed to determine their applicability to pandemic preparedness. Plant-based biologics production systems have progressed to a state of commercial viability in the past 30 years with the capacity for production of complex, glycosylated, “mammalian compatible” molecules in a system with comparatively low production costs, high scalability, and production flexibility.

Thus, we did a meta-analysis evaluating the effect of echinacea on the incidence and duration of the common cold. 14 unique studies were included in the meta-analysis. Incidence of the common cold was reported as an odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI, and duration of the common cold was reported as the weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% CI. Weighted averages and mean differences were calculated by a random-effects model (DerSimonian-Laird methodology). Heterogeneity was assessed by the Q statistic and review of L'Abbé plots, and publication bias was assessed through the Egger weighted regression statistic and visual inspection of funnel plots. Echinacea decreased the odds of developing the common cold by 58% (OR 0·42; 95% CI 0·25–0·71; Q statistic p<0·001) and the duration of a cold by 1·4 days (WMD −1·44, −2·24 to −0·64; p=0·01).

Plasma cells are not routinely found in peripheral blood, though may produce virus-neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 later in the course of an infection. METHODS: Using the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Precision Medicine Analytics Platform Registry, we identified hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and stratified by presence of plasma cells and WHO disease severity. To identify plasma cells, we employed a sensitive flow cytometric screening method for highly fluorescent lymphocytes and confirmed these microscopically. Cox regression models were used to evaluate time to death and time to clinical improvement by the presence of plasma cells in patients with severe disease. RESULTS: Of 2,301 hospitalized patients with confirmed infection, 371 had plasma cells identified. Patients with plasma cells were more likely to have severe disease, though 86.6% developed plasma cells after onset of severe disease. In patients with severe disease, after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, race and other covariates associated with disease severity, patients with plasma cells had a reduced hazard of death (aHR: 0.57; 95%CI: 0.38 to 0.87; p-value: 0.008). There was no significant association with the presence of plasma cells and time to clinical improvement.

624859,Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies to Reduce Climate Vulnerabilities and Maintain Ecosystem Services,2013-03-26,"Since its emergence in Wuhan, China in late 2019, the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 have been among the most debated issues related to COVID-19. Throughout its spread around the world, the viral genome continued acquiring new mutations and some of them became widespread. Among them, 14408 C>T and 23403 A>G mutations in RdRp and S, respectively, became dominant in Europe and the US, which led to debates regarding their effects on the mutability and transmissibility of the virus. In this study, we aimed to investigate possible differences between time-dependent variation of mutation densities (MDe) of viral strains that carry these two mutations and those that do not. Our analyses at the genome and gene level led to two important findings: First, time-dependent changes in the average MDe of circulating SARS-CoV-2 genomes showed different characteristics before and after the beginning of April, when daily new case numbers started levelling off. Second, this pattern was much delayed or even non-existent for the “mutant” (MT) strain that harbored both 14408 C>T and 23403 A>G mutations. Although these differences were not limited to a few hotspots, it is intriguing that the MDe increase is most evident in two critical genes, S and Orf1ab, which are also the genes that harbor the defining mutations of the MT genotype. The nature of these unexpected relationships warrants further research.","Eskier, Doğa; Suner, Aslı; Karakülah, Gökhan; Oktay, Yavuz",PeerJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32879797/; https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.9703,394

We therefore determined its association with disease in young children with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). METHODS AND FINDINGS: Nine hundred forty-nine samples of nasopharyngeal secretions from children under 3 y of age with LRTIs were analysed by a quantitative HCoV-NL63-specific real-time PCR. The samples had been collected from hospitalised patients and outpatients from December 1999 to October 2001 in four different regions in Germany as part of the prospective population-based PRI.DE study and analysed for RNA from respiratory viruses. Forty-nine samples (5.2%), mainly derived from the winter season, were positive for HCoV-NL63 RNA. The viral RNA was more prevalent in samples from outpatients (7.9%) than from hospitalised patients (3.2%, p = 0.003), and co-infection with either respiratory syncytial virus or parainfluenza virus 3 was observed frequently. Samples in which only HCoV-NL63 RNA could be detected had a significantly higher viral load than samples containing additional respiratory viruses (median 2.1 × 10(6) versus 2.7 × 10(2) copies/ml, p = 0.0006). A strong association with croup was apparent: 43% of the HCoV-NL63-positive patients with high HCoV-NL63 load and absence of co-infection suffered from croup, compared to 6% in the HCoV-NL63-negative group, p < 0.0001. A significantly higher fraction (17.4%) of samples from croup patients than from non-croup patients (4.2%) contained HCoV-NL63 RNA. CONCLUSION: HCoV-NL63 infections occur frequently in young children with LRTI and show a strong association with croup, suggesting a causal relationship.","van der Hoek, Lia; Sure, Klaus; Ihorst, Gabriele; Stang, Alexander; Pyrc, Krzysztof; Jebbink, Maarten F; Petersen, Gudula; Forster, Johannes; Berkhout, Ben; Überla, Klaus",PLoS Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16104827/,394

626477,Correction to: Decision support system for ranking relevant indicators for reopening strategies following COVID-19 lockdowns,2021-05-03,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT) pose multiple risk factors that may increase the risk of death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently, evidence of incidence, management, and prognosis of COVID-19 in this population are scarce. METHOD: Between May and December 2020, we followed two RRT populations that have the same tertiary hospital in Southern Brazil as its reference hospital for transplantation. Firstly, we monitored eight affiliated dialysis clinics keeping track of COVID-19 incidence and fatality rate in dialysis patients and those on the kidney transplant waiting list. In the same period, we also monitor COVID-19 incidence and mortality among our prevalent population of kidney transplant recipients. RESULTS: We evaluated 1049 patients in RRT in the dialysis centers. COVID-19 occurred in 89 of such patients (8.5%), and 31 died from such condition (35.8% death rate). Fifteen patients (5.45%), among 275 on the kidney transplant waiting list, contracted the virus, with one death (6.6%). Within our prevalent population of 1348 kidney transplant recipients, 113 were diagnosed with COVID19 (incidence: 8.4%), and 17 of them died (mortality rate: 15%). Finally, the number of kidney transplants decreased by 60.4% compared with the same period in the previous year. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 determined a substantial impact on RRT. A high frequency of chronic dialysis patients expired from the disease. The impact on the patients on the transplant waiting list seems to be less pronounced probably due to their better health conditions. The fatality rate in kidney transplant recipients is elevated and probably mostly related to comorbidities. Brazil is currently entering the second wave of the disease and it is crucial to find and provide means to protect such vulnerable populations.","Teichman, Pedro do Valle; Rosa Viccari, Alessandra; Fontanive Franco, Rodrigo; Budel da Silva, Maria Luiza; Da Silva Oliveira, Carla Elisabete; Bauer, Andrea Carla; Santos Gonçalves, Luiz Felipe; Ceratti Manfro, Roberto",Nephrol Dial Transplant,https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfab110.0048,394
626894,Viewpoint: The future of work in agri-food,2020-10-09,"PURPOSE: To evaluate outcomes of CT fluoroscopy-guided core lung biopsies with emphasis on diagnostic yield, complications, and efficacy of parenchymal and pleural blood patching to avoid chest tube placement. METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective analysis of CT fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous core lung biopsies between 2006 and 2020. Parenchymal blood patching during introducer needle withdrawal was performed in 74% of cases as a preventative measure, and pleural blood patching was the primary salvage maneuver for symptomatic or growing pneumothorax in 60/83 (72.2%) of applicable cases. RESULTS: A total of 1029 patients underwent 1112 biopsies (532 men, mean age 66 years, 38.6% history of emphysema, lesion size=16.7 mm). The diagnostic yield was 93.6% (1032/1103). Fewer complications requiring intervention were observed in patients who had undergone parenchymal blood patching (5.7 vs. 14.2%, p<0.001). Further intervention was required in 83/182 pneumothorax cases including: 1) Pleural blood patch (5.4%, 60/1112), 2) chest tube placement without a pleural blood patch attempt (1.5%, 17/1112), and 3) simple aspiration (0.5%, 6/1112). Pleural blood patch as monotherapy was successful in 83.3% (50/60) without need for further intervention. The overall chest tube rate was 2.6% (29/1112). Emphysema was the only significant risk factor for complications requiring intervention (p=<0.001). CONCLUSION: Percutaneous CT fluoroscopy-guided core lung biopsies performed with standardized techniques provide excellent diagnostic yield and few serious complications. Parenchymal blood patching during introducer needle withdrawal decreased complications requiring intervention. Salvage pleural blood patching reduced the frequency of chest tube placement for pneumothorax.","Zlevor, Annie M; Mauch, Scott C; Knott, Emily A; Pickhardt, Perry J; Gettle, Lori Mankowski; Mao, Lu; Meyer, Cristopher A; Hartung, Michael P; Kim, David H; Lubner, Meghan G; Hinshaw, J Louis; Foltz, Marcia L; Ziemlewicz, Timothy J; Lee, Fred T",J. vasc. interv. radiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2021.06.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34229043/,394

The first viral whole-genome was sequenced using high-throughput sequencing from a sample collected in Wuhan, China. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is imperative in investigating disease outbreak transmission dynamics and guiding decision-making in public health. Methods: We retrieved archived SARS-CoV-2 samples at the Integrated Biorepository of H3Africa Uganda, Makerere University (IBRH3AU). These samples were collected previously from individuals diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). 30 samples with cycle thresholds (Cts) values <25 were selected for WGS using SARS-CoV-2 ARTIC protocol at Makerere University Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory. Results: 28 out of 30 (93.3%) samples generated analyzable genomic sequence reads. We detected SARS-CoV-2 and lineages A (22/28) and B (6/28) from the samples. We further show phylogenetic relatedness of these isolates alongside other 328 Uganda (lineage A = 222, lineage B = 106) SARS-CoV-2 genomes available in GISAID by April 22, 2021 and submitted by the Uganda Virus Research Institute. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated adoption and optimization of the low-cost ARTIC SARS-CoV-2 WGS protocol in a resource limited laboratory setting.

The complex social dynamics of overtourism,2021-02-23,"Cryo-electron Tomography (cryo-ET) generates 3D visualization of cellular organization that allows biologists to analyze cellular structures in a near-native state with nano resolution. Recently, deep learning methods have demonstrated promising performance in classification and segmentation of macromolecule structures captured by cryo-ET, but training individual deep learning models requires large amounts of manually labeled and segmented data from previously observed classes. To perform classification and segmentation in the wild (i.e., with limited training data and with unseen classes), novel deep learning model needs to be developed to classify and segment unseen macromolecules captured by cryo-ET. In this paper, we develop a one-shot learning framework, called cryo-ET one-shot network (COS-Net), for simultaneous classification of macromolecular structure and generation of the voxel-level 3D segmentation, using only one training sample per class. Our experimental results on 22 macromolecule classes demonstrated that our COS-Net could efficiently classify macromolecular structures with small amounts of samples and produce accurate 3D segmentation at the same time.","Zhou, Bo; Yu, Haisu; Zeng, Xiangrui; Yang, Xiaoyan; Zhang, Jing; Xu, Min",Front Mol Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33511158/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2020.613347,394

630565,Study of Coronavirus Impact on Parisian Population from April to June using Twitter and Text Mining Approach,2020-08-18,"Recently an increasing number of new adenovirus types associated with type-dependent pathogenicity have been identified. However, identification of these clinical isolates represents the very first step to characterize novel pathogens. For deeper analyses, these adenoviruses need to be further characterized in basic virology experiments or they could be applied in translational research. To achieve this goal, it is essential to get genetic access and to enable genetic modification of these novel adenovirus genomes (deletion, insertion, and mutation). Here we demonstrate a high-throughput approach to get genetic access to new adenoviruses via homologous recombination. We first defined the cloning conditions regarding homology arm-length and input adenoviral genome amounts. Then we cloned four naturally occurring adenoviruses (Ad70, Ad73, Ad74, and Ad75) into easy-to-manipulate plasmids and genetically modified them by reporter gene insertion. Three recombinant adenoviruses (Ad70, Ad73, and Ad74) containing a reporter cassette were successfully reconstituted. These novel reporter-labeled adenoviruses were further characterized using the inserted luciferase reporter with respect to receptor usage, presence of anti-adenovirus antibodies, and tropism in vitro. The identified receptor usage, the relatively low prevalence of anti-adenovirus antibodies, and the various cancer cell line transduction pattern are important features of these new pathogens providing essential information for their therapeutic application.","Zhang, Wenli; Mese, Kemal; Schellhorn, Sebastian; Bahlmann, Nora; Mach, Nicolas; Bunz, Oskar; Dhingra, Akshay; Hage, Elias; Lafon, Marie-Edith; Wodrich, Harald; Heim, Albert; Ehrhardt, Anja",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21176370; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32887347/,394

We explore these effects by conducting a text analysis of the content of posts by 387,730 Weibo users. The results show that the severity of the epidemic promotes prosocial tendencies; anger motivates prosocial tendencies significantly; and the severity of the epidemic moderates the effects of three emotions—anger, sadness, and surprise—on prosocial tendencies.

Epidemiological data on pediatric coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases after school opening are warranted. METHODS: We analyzed data of the pediatric patients with COVID-19 collected from the press release of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Information on the school opening delay and re-opening policies were achieved from the press release of the Korean Ministry of Education. RESULTS: The school openings were delayed three times in March 2020. Online classes started from April 9, and off-line (in-person) classes started from May 20 to June 8 at four steps in different grades of students. There was no sudden increase in pediatric cases after the school opening, and the proportion of pediatric cases among total confirmed cases in the nation around 7.0%. As of July 31, 44 children from 38 schools and kindergartens were diagnosed with COVID-19 after off-line classes started. More than 13,000 students and staffs were tested; only one additional student was found to be infected in the same classroom. The proportions of pediatric patients without information on infection sources were higher in older age groups than in younger age groups (17.4% vs. 52.4%, P = 0.014). In the younger age group, 78.3% of children were infected by family members, while only 23.8% of adolescents in the older age group were infected by family members (P < 0.001).

However, with the variety of vaccines, immunization strategies, and waning antibody titers, defining correlates of immunity across a spectrum of antibody titers is urgently required. Thus, we profiled the humoral immune response in a cohort of non-human primates immunized with a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (NVX-CoV2373) at two doses, administered as a single or two-dose regimen. Both antigen dose and boosting significantly altered neutralization titers and Fc-effector profiles, driving unique vaccine-induced antibody fingerprints Combined differences in antibody effector functions and neutralization were associated with distinct levels of protection in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Moreover, NVX-CoV2373 elicited antibodies that functionally targeted emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Collectively, the data presented here suggest that a single dose may prevent disease via combined Fc/Fab functions, but that two doses may be essential to block further transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants.","Gorman, Matthew J.; Patel, Nita; Guebre-Xabier, Mimi; Zhu, Alex L.; Atyeo, Caroline; Pullen, Krista M.; Loos, Carolin; Goez-Gazi, Yenny; Carrion, Ricardo; Tian, Jing-Hui; Yuan, Dansu; Bowman, Kathryn A.; Zhou, Bin; Maciejewski, Sonia; McGrath, Marisa E.; Logue, James; Frieman, Matthew B.; Montefiori, David; Mann, Colin; Schendel, Sharon; Amanat, Fatima; Krammer, Florian; Saphire, Erica Ollmann; Lauffenburger, Douglas; Greene, Ann M.; Portnoff, Alyse D.; Massare, Michael J.; Ellingsworth, Larry; Glenn, Gregory; Smith, Gale; Alter, Galit",Cell Rep Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2021.100405; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379121002639?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666379121002639; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34485950/,394

634021,"Unsupervised machine learning reveals key immune cell subsets in COVID-19, rhinovirus infection, and cancer therapy",2020-08-01,"INTRODUCTION: The assistant in medicine is a new and paid role for final-year medical students that has been established in New South Wales, Australia, as part of the surge workforce management response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Eligibility requires the applicant to be a final-year medical student in an Australian Medical Council-accredited university and registered with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency. While there are roles with some similarities to the assistant in medicine role, such as assistantships (the UK) and physician assistants adopted internationally, this is completely new in Australia. Little is known about the functionality and success factors of this role within the health practitioner landscape, particularly within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the complexity of this role, a realist approach to evaluation has been undertaken as described in this protocol, which sets out a study design spanning from August 2020 to June 2021. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The intention of conducting a realist review is to identify the circumstances and mechanisms that determine the outcomes of the assistant in medicine intervention. We will start by developing an initial programme theory to explore the potential function of the assistant in medicine role through realist syntheses of critically appraised summaries of existing literature using relevant databases and journals. Other data sources such as interviews and surveys with key stakeholders will contribute to the refinements of the programme theory. Using this method, we will develop a set of hypotheses on how and why the Australian assistants in medicine intervention might ‘work’ to achieve a variety of outcomes based on examples of related international interventions. These hypotheses will be tested against the qualitative and quantitative evidence gathered from all relevant stakeholders. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval for the larger study was obtained from the Western Sydney Local Health District (2020/ETH01745). The findings of this review will provide useful information for hospital managers, academics and policymakers, who can apply the findings in their context when deciding how to implement and support the introduction of assistants in medicine into the health system. We will publish our findings in reports to policymakers, peer-reviewed journals and international conferences.","Monrouxe, Lynn V; Hockey, Peter; Khanna, Priya; Klinner, Christiane; Mogensen, Lise; O'Mara, D A; Roach, Abbey; Tobin, Stephen; Davids, Jennifer Ann",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045822; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34489266/,394
634774,"Economic freedom, pandemics, and robust political economy",2021-02-19,"Abstract BACKGROUND: Established systems for education and rapid dissemination of information are essential to a healthcare facility's ability to respond to emerging public health threats. We assessed the education activities and communication resources available for this purpose in a representative sample of U.S. hospitals. METHODS: We selected a 20% (n=1236) random sample of hospitals from the 2000 American Hospital Association database, stratified by bed size, service, metropolitan statistical sampling area (MSSA), and region to ensure representativeness. Infection control professionals (ICPs) at the hospitals were asked to complete a Web-based questionnaire during October 21–December 22, 2003. RESULTS: ICPs at 556 (45%) hospitals completed the survey, including 518 (93%) general medical-surgical, 20 (4%) other specialty (including oncology), and 18 (3%) children's hospitals; 352 (63%) were in urban (<100,000 population) areas and 224 (40%) had <100 beds. Most hospitals had provided educational programs about infection control issues related to smallpox (87%), smallpox vaccine-related adverse events (76%), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (75%); and anthrax (73%). Fewer offered programs on monkeypox (27%). Hospitals reported that the best ways to disseminate information to them were via e-mail (97%), Web sites or group e-mail lists (72%), videoconference (40%), or teleconference (35%). Urban hospitals were more likely than rural to identify Web sites (p=0.001) and videoconference (p=0.03) as the best ways to receive information. Hospitals used e-mail (94%), teleconferencing (72%), Web-based training (61%), computer-based tools (50%), and videoconferencing (46%) to reach hospital-based clinical personnel. Urban hospitals were more likely than rural to use e-mail (p=0.01) to reach personnel. Hospitals identified model preparedness plans (61%), educational materials for personnel (54%) or patients/public (40%), and tabletop exercises/drills (46%) as being most helpful to preparedness efforts. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitals may differ substantially in preparedness and response readiness. These findings will assist in determining the best strategies for communicating with hospitals and providing information to assist them in preparedness efforts.","Bolyard∗, E.; Scott, R.

There is growing evidence suggesting the involvement of the interferon (IFN) pathway in RV-associated morbidity in asthma and COPD. The mechanisms of RV-triggered exacerbations in CF are poorly understood. In a pilot study, we assessed the antiviral response of CF and healthy bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) to RV infection, we measured the levels of IFNs, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) upon infection with major and minor group RVs and poly(IC) stimulation. Major group RV infection of CF BECs resulted in a trend towards a diminished IFN response at the level of IFNs, PRRs and ISGs in comparison to healthy BECs. Contrary to major group RV, the IFN pathway induction upon minor group RV infection was significantly increased at the level of IFNs and PRRs in CF BECs compared to healthy BECs.","Schögler, Aline; Stokes, Andrea B.; Casaulta, Carmen; Regamey, Nicolas; Edwards, Michael R.; Johnston, Sebastian L.; Jung, Andreas; Moeller, Alexander; Geiser, Thomas; Alves, Marco P.",J Cyst Fibros,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S156919931500257X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcf.2015.10.013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156919931500257X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26613982/,394
637874,Crisis management of SARS in a hospital,2004-07-28,"INTRODUCTION: Today, COVID‐19 pandemic is still the most critical problem in the global health agenda. Since the awareness of the public in general and particularly awareness of those with comorbidities, such as cancer, determine the rate of mortality, the primary goal of this study was to assess the knowledge, perceptions and attitude of the patients with cancer towards the COVID‐19 pandemic. The secondary objective of this study was also to measure the effect of COVID‐19 on cancer patients’ ongoing treatments. METHODS: This study recruited 300 oncology patients through an outpatient community‐based oncology clinic in one of the 30 major cities of Turkey, which had taken a lockdown at weekends during April 2020. A questionnaire measuring the knowledge, attitudes and preventive behaviour was completed by each patient either face‐to‐face or through telephone survey. RESULTS: In general, participants had a positive attitude towards protective measures. No delay for current cancer treatments or appointments has been observed in 98% of patients. More than half of the patients(52.3%) were using some kind of nutritional supplement to increase their body resistance. Nearly two‐third of patients could not identify the three most common symptoms of COVID‐19 (fever, cough, dyspnoea), and half of them were not aware of the routes of transmission (by contact and droplets). It was observed that patients with stage 1 cancer were tend to stay at home, while patients with stage 4 cancer were prone to leave their houses for the hospital at a higher ratio. The rate of people leaving houses was significantly higher for male patients and for patients with a university degree, whereas patients who were older than 65 were tend to go only to the hospital when they leave their houses. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that routine follow‐up and guidance for cancer patients seems to provide significant benefit to increase the knowledge and awareness of patients with cancer.","Erdem, Dilek; Karaman, Irem",Eur J Cancer Care (Engl),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32945043/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ecc.13309,394

Since patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) often exhibit motor disability and receive disease-modifying therapy (DMT), which has an immunosuppressive effect, it is plausible that this will affect the susceptibility of MS patients to COVID-19, as well as the course of this disease. However, current data indicate that the use of DMT does not cause negative prognosis in COVID-19 sufferers, but the motor disability progression associated with MS does. In this study, we present the case reports of 4 patients with relapsing-remitting MS, who developed COVID-19, and despite the use of DMT the course of the disease was mild. Two patients were treated with dimethyl fumarate, one with Interferon β1b and one with glatiramer acetate. One of the patients using dimethyl fumarate had lymphopenia. All patients had symptoms of COVID-19 from the nervous system, the most frequent being headache, which occurred in all patients. The aim of this article is to present a case series of four patients with MS and COVID-19, and to discuss the available literature on COVID-19 in patients with MS, with particular consideration of the impact of DMT.","Adamczyk-Sowa, Monika; Mado, Hubert; Kubicka-Bączyk, Katarzyna; Jaroszewicz, Jerzy; Sobala-Szczygieł, Barbara; Bartman, Wojciech; Sowa, Paweł",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0303846720307940; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303846720307940; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clineuro.2020.106451; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33388661/,394
638548,Is gold a hedge against inflation? New evidence from a nonlinear ARDL approach,2016-01-18,"Countries around the globe have implemented unprecedented measures to mitigate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We aim to predict the COVID-19 disease course and compare the effectiveness of mitigation measures across countries to inform policy decision making using a robust and parsimonious survival-convolution model. We account for transmission during a pre-symptomatic incubation period and use a time-varying effective reproduction number (R(t)) to reflect the temporal trend of transmission and change in response to a public health intervention. We estimate the intervention effect on reducing the transmission rate using a natural experiment design and quantify uncertainty by permutation. In China and South Korea, we predicted the entire disease epidemic using only early phase data (2–3 weeks after the outbreak). A fast rate of decline in R(t) was observed, and adopting mitigation strategies early in the epidemic was effective in reducing the transmission rate in these two countries. The nationwide lockdown in Italy did not accelerate the speed at which the transmission rate decreases. In the United States, R(t) significantly decreased during a 2-week period after the declaration of national emergency, but it declined at a much slower rate afterwards. If the trend continues after May 1, COVID-19 may be controlled by late July. However, a loss of temporal effect (e.g., due to relaxing mitigation measures after May 1) could lead to a long delay in controlling the epidemic (mid-November with fewer than 100 daily cases) and a total of more than 2 million cases.","Wang, Qinxia; Xie, Shanghong; Wang, Yuanjia; Zeng, Donglin",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719764/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00325,394

The purpose of this research was to analyze the factors that determine the Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS) in the rural area of the Paute River Basin, Azuay Province, Ecuador. The sample size of 383 surveys was determined by a stratified random sampling method with proportional affixation. Dietary diversity was measured through the HDDS, with 12 food groups (cereals; roots and tubers; fruits; sugar/honey; meat and eggs; legumes or grains; vegetables; oils/fats; milk and dairy products; meats; miscellaneous; fish and shellfish) over a recall period of 7 days. A Poisson regression model was used to determine the relationship between the HDDS and sociodemographic variables. The results show that the average HDDS of food consumption is 10.89 foods. Of the analyzed food groups, the most consumed are cereals; roots and tubers; fruits; sugar/honey. In addition, the determinants that best explain the HDDS in the predictive model were housing size, household size, per capita food expenditure, area of cultivated land, level of education, and marital status of the head of household. The tools used in this research can be used to analyze food and nutrition security interventions. Furthermore, the results allow policymakers to identify applicable public policies in the fight against hunger.","Cordero-Ahiman, Otilia Vanessa; Vanegas, Jorge Leonardo; Franco-Crespo, Christian; Beltrán-Romero, Pablo; Quinde-Lituma, María Elena",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33672453/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18042059,394

Symptoms of CHIKV include fever and persistent, severe arthritis. In recent years, several antiviral drugs have been evaluated in clinical trials; however, no registered antivirals have been approved for clinical therapy. In this study, we established a high-throughput screening (HTS) system based on CHIKV 26S mediated insect cell fusion inhibition assay. Our screening system was able to search potential anti-CHIKV drugs in vitro. Using this system, four compounds (niclosamide, nitazoxanide, niflumic acid, tolfenamic acid) were identified. These compounds were then further analyzed using a microneutralization assay. We determined that niclosamide and nitazoxanide exhibit ability to against CHIKV-induced CPE. The anti-CHIKV abilities of these compounds were further confirmed by RT-qPCR and IFA. Moreover, niclosamide and nitazoxanide were found to (1) limit virus entry, (2) inhibit both viral release and cell-to-cell transmission, and (3) possess broad anti-alphavius activities, including against two clinical CHIKV isolates and two alphaviruses: Sindbis virus (SINV) and Semliki forest virus (SFV). In conclusion, our findings suggested that niclosamide and nitazoxanide were able to inhibit CHIKV entry and transmission, which might provide a basis for the development of novel human drug therapies against CHIKV and other alphavirus infections.","Wang, Yu-Ming; Lu, Jeng-Wei; Lin, Chang-Chi; Chin, Yuan-Fan; Wu, Tzong-Yuan; Lin, Liang-In; Lai, Zheng-Zong; Kuo, Szu-Cheng; Ho, Yi-Jung",Antiviral Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2016.10.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27742486/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354216303242; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354216303242,394

DESIGN, DATA SOURCES AND ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane Library, SCOPUS and JSTOR, initially between 31 May 2019 and 21 January 2021. Research articles and reviews on the use of contact tracing, testing, self-isolation and quarantine for COVID-19 management were included in the review. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: We extracted information including study objective, design, methods, main findings and implications. These were tabulated and a narrative synthesis was undertaken given the diverse research designs, methods and implications. RESULTS: We identified and included 118 eligible studies. We identified the core elements of an effective find, test, trace, isolate, support (FTTIS) system needed to interrupt the spread of a novel infectious disease, where treatment or vaccination was not yet available, as pertained in the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. We report methods used to shorten case finding time, improve accuracy and efficiency of tests, coordinate stakeholders and actors involved in an FTTIS system, support individuals isolating and make appropriate use of digital tools. CONCLUSIONS: We identified in our systematic review the key components of an FTTIS system. These include border controls, restricted entry, inbound traveller quarantine and comprehensive case finding; repeated testing to minimise false diagnoses and pooled testing in resource-limited circumstances; extended quarantine period and the use of digital tools for contact tracing and self-isolation. Support for mental or physical health and livelihoods is needed for individuals undergoing self-isolation/quarantine.

It is now proved that it can affect different body organs which necessitate intensive care management. Ozone (O3) therapy was used before for treating various viral infections like hepatitis B, human immune deficiency virus (HIV), and Ebola viruses. O3 also can manage hypoxia and increase tissue oxygenation, besides its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties which may have an important role in the management of cytokine storm. We used rectal O3 insufflation therapy assuming that it may have a beneficial role in the management of COVID-19 disease. Two sessions of rectal O3 therapy were given to a 60-year-old female patient who was confirmed COVID-19 positive. Before applying O3 therapy, she was hypoxic (sPO2:90%) despite mechanical ventilation with high fraction inspired oxygen (FiO2:90%). After therapy, she was markedly improved and discharged to the inpatient ward and then discharged home on day 10 post-admission. Another 40-year-old male patient who was confirmed COVID-19 positive and was home isolated received one session of O3 therapy. Before therapy, he was hypoxic (sPO2:85% on room air and 95% with O2 face mask 5 L/min). The patient showed gradual improvement over the next 3 days after therapy and becomes oxygen-independent (sPO2 became 94–97% on room air). No adverse effects were noticed in both cases.

It has been shown that during school closures, there are significant decreases in the diagnoses of the respiratory infections. This has brought as well to a reduction in all those symptoms related to adenotonsillar hypertrophy. METHODS: The study included 162 children, aged between 3 and 13 years, waiting for adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy, eventually combined with tympanocentesis or tube insertion. Parents have been called to answer a telephone interview aimed at detecting how the symptoms related to adenotonsillar hypertrophy were changing during lockdown. RESULTS: There was an improvement in the overall symptomatology of children during the lockdown period. The value attributed by parents to the children’s general assessment during the lockdown period decreased significatively during the quarantine (p=0,0000).

647427,Approaches to the Diagnosis and Management of Ovarian Cancer in Pregnancy,2021-03-11,"There are some concerns regarding alcohol use behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. The mixed findings of the first alcohol use studies during this pandemic may reflect the lack of differentiation between on-premise and home consumption. Most of the countries adopted severe restrictions on drinking place functioning. Alcohol retail store sales temporal data were used to examine alcohol sales changes in the United States (U.S.) throughout the COVID-19 pandemic as a proxy indicator of at-home drinking. Data were sourced from the Monthly Retail Trade Survey, which has provided U.S. representative estimates of sales at retail and food services stores since 1951. In the present study, we analyzed data from seasonally adjusted beer, wine, and liquor store (BWLS) sales from January 1992 to September 2020. Poisson cubic spline models were used to assess nonlinearity in such sales during the period. These models were adjusted to the consumer price index for alcoholic beverages. There was a significant increase in retail alcohol sales during the beginning of the pandemic, reaching a plateau in the third quarter of 2020. During the COVID-19 period (March 2020 to September 2020), there were 41.9 billion dollars in BWLS sales, representing an increase of 20% compared to the same period in 2019. On the other hand, food and drinking place retail sales decreased by 27% during the same period in the same survey. These results may indicate an increase in home drinking during the period, which could potentially lead to higher alcohol consumption and alcohol-related adverse health outcomes. More aggressive efforts should be made to warn the population about the risks associated with increased home alcohol consumption during the pandemic. Additionally, tracking individual alcohol consumption and releasing real-time data at different levels are needed to better assess the effects of increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic.","Castaldelli-Maia, João M.; Segura, Luis E.; Martins, Silvia S.",Alcohol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34245809/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0741832921000732; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.alcohol.2021.06.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0741832921000732,394

The main proximal factor was loneliness (AdjOR = 8.12 p < 0.001). Problems related to school closures also played an important role. Regular intake of fruits and vegetables, as well as physical activity, demonstrated a positive influence on emotional well-being, while excessive screen time (AdjOR = 2.05, p < 0.001) and alcohol consumption negatively affected outcomes (AdjOR = 1.73, p < 0.001). As for distal variables, less affluent adolescents were the most affected, and males reported fewer emotional problems than females. Uncertainty regarding the disease in a context of socioeconomic vulnerability, together with rises in unhealthy behaviors and isolation from their immediate social circles, have negatively affected adolescents’ emotional status throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.","Szwarcwald, Célia Landmann; Malta, Deborah Carvalho; Barros, Marilisa Berti de Azevedo; de Souza Júnior, Paulo Roberto Borges; Romero, Dália; de Almeida, Wanessa da Silva; Damacena, Giseli Nogueira; Werneck, André Oliveira; da Silva, Danilo Rodrigues Pereira; Lima, Margareth Guimarães; Gomes, Crizian Saar; Azevedo, Luiz Otávio; Ferreira, Arthur Pate de Souza; Gracie, Renata; de Pina, Maria de Fátima",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18116160; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34200307/,394
648919,Is Your Neural Data Part of Your Mind? Exploring the Conceptual Basis of Mental Privacy,2021-09-23,"Abstract The contribution of cell-mediated immunity to protective immunity against virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection conferred by primary porcine respiratry coronavirus (PRCV) or TGEV exposure was assessed in pigs that were challenged with TGEV 24 days after a primary oronasal inoculation with PRCV or TGEV when 11 days old. PRCV exposure induced partial protection against TGEV challenge in suckling pigs based upon a decreased number of diarrhea cases (42% vs. 90% in age-matched control pigs), limited virus shedding in feces, and increases in virus-neutralizing serum antibody titers; in contrast, all 11-day-old pigs inoculated with TGEV were completely protected after challenge. Weaned pigs were also studied to eliminate any possibility that lactogenic immunity from contact PRCV-exposed sows contributed to protection against TGEV. Once weaned, none of the PRCV-exposed or age-matched control pigs had diarrhea after TGEV challenge; moreover, both groups exhibited less rectal virus shedding than suckling pigs. Vigorous lymphocyte proliferative responses (> 96 000 counts per minute (cpm)) were detected in mononuclear cells prepared from mesenteric (MLN) and bronchial (BLN) lymph nodes of TGEV-primed pigs. Analyses of these responses indicate that virus-specific cell-mediated immune responses correlated with protection against rectal and nasal virus shedding after TGEV challenge. Primary inoculation of 11-day-old pigs with PRCV induced moderate, transient virus-specific lymphocyte proliferation (> 47 000 cpm) in MLN from both suckling and weaned pigs after TGEV challenge. Substantial BLN proliferative responses (> 80 000 cpm) correlated with failure to detect TGEV in nasal secretions from these pigs. Virus-specific lymphocyte proliferation in spleens was delayed in onset and of lower magnitude than that observed in MLN and BLN. Virulent TGEV exposure resulted in increased percentages of T cell subsets, especially in the lamina propria and MLN, mucosaassociated lymphoid tissues in proximity to the primary replication site of TGEV in the small intestine. Our results confirm that PRCV infection primes anti-viral immune responses and, thus, contributes to partial immunity against virulent TGEV challenge.","Brim, Theresa A.; VanCott, John L.; Lunney, Joan K.; Saif, Linda J.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/016524279405416P; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8533315/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016524279405416P,394

We aim to investigate the therapeutic effect of arbidol and moxifloxacin in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods We collected and analyzed data on 94 patients with COVID-19 including 27 severe patients at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and 74 ordinary patients at general isolation ward in Wuhan Xiehe Hospital, from February 15, 2020 to March 15, 2020. All patients were treated with arbidol (100mg each time, three times a day for 14 days) and moxifloxacin (0.4g each time, once a day for 7-14 days). Other data was also collected including demographic data, symptoms, laboratory findings, treatments and clinical outcomes. Results In basic characteristics, compared with the ordinary patients, the severe patients were older (median age was 63.0 years V.S 57.0 years, p=0.03), had higher proportion of hypertension (30% V.S 9%, p=0.03), higher possibility of getting fatigue and/or myalgia (26% V.S 6%, p=0.03), and had more obvious dyspnea symptom (26% V.S 3%, p=0.006). In regarding to laboratory results, we found the severe patients have higher white blood cell counts (p=0.003), neutrophil counts (p=0.007), higher levels of D-dimer (p<0.001), ALT (p<0.001) and AST (p=0.013) than the ordinary patients. After treatment of arbidol and moxifloxacin for one week, the rates of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid turning negative were 69.2% in the severe group and 77.8% in the ordinary group. A peculiar phenomenon was that IL-6 stands out among the cytokines in both groups, and higher in severe group than the ordinary one (p=0.011). After treating with arbidol and moxifloxacin for one week, IL-6 decreased significantly in severe group (p=0.023). Conclusion In summary, we proved the treatment of arbidol and moxifloxacin could be helpful in reducing viral load and inflammation during SARS-CoV2 infection, especially for negatively regulating fatal inflammation in severe COVID-19 patients. However, more evidence awaits further clinical verification.","YU, D.; SUN, S.; LI, Y.; XI, W.; JIN, D.; SUN, K.; YU, R.; YAO, X.; SONG, Z.; YANG, A.; LUO, R.; ZOU, B.; LIU, Y.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.30.20117598v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.30.20117598,394

650764,Analysing natural ventilation to reduce the cooling energy consumption and the fuel poverty of social dwellings in coastal zones,2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND: Guideline recommendations state oxygen should be administered to acutely unwell patients to achieve a target oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) range. The current practice of manual oxygen titration frequently results in SpO(2) outside of a prescribed range. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of automatic oxygen titration using a closed-loop feedback system to achieve SpO(2) within a prescribed target range METHODS: An open-label randomised parallel group trial was undertaken comparing automatic oxygen titration using a novel nasal high-flow device to manual oxygen titration using nasal high flow. Medical inpatients requiring oxygen therapy in Wellington Regional Hospital, New Zealand with a prescribed target SpO(2) range of 88%–92% or 92%–96% were recruited and randomised equally between the interventions for a period of 24 hours. The primary outcome was the proportion of time spent with SpO(2) within the prescribed range. RESULTS: 20 patients were included in the analysis. Automatic oxygen titration resulted in a median (IQR) 96.2% (95.2–97.8) of time within the target range compared with 71% (59.4–88.3) with manual titration; difference (95% CI) 24.2% (7.9% to 35%), p<0.001. There was a reduction in the time spent with SpO(2) ≥2% above and ≥2% below range in the automatic titration group, although the point estimate for the differences were small; −1% (−8.2% to −0.04%), p=0.017 and −2.4% (−11.5% to 0.3%), p=0.05 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Nasal high-flow with automatic oxygen titration resulted in a greater proportion of time spent with SpO(2) in target range compared with manual titration.

In addition, we determined whether EVD-related stigma is a predictor of informal health care use among EVD survivors. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among 358 EVD survivors in five districts across all four geographic regions (Western Area, Northern Province, Eastern Province and Southern Province) of Sierra Leone. Ebola-related stigma was measured by adapting the validated HIV related stigma for people living with HIV/AIDS instrument. We also measured traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM) use (as a measure of informal healthcare use). Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and regression analysis. RESULTS: EVD survivors report higher levels of internalised stigma (0.92 ± 0.77) compared to total enacted stigma (0.71 ± 0.61). Social isolation (0.96 ± 0.88) was the highest reported enacted stigma subscale. Ebola survivors who identified as Christians [AOR = 2.51, 95%CI: 1.15–5.49, p = 0.021], who perceived their health to be fair/poor [AOR = 2.58, 95%CI: 1.39–4.77. p = 0.003] and who reside in the northern region of Sierra Leone [AOR = 2.80, 95%CI: 1.29–6.07, p = 0.009] were more likely to experience internalised stigma. Verbal abuse [AOR = 1.95, 95%CI: 1.09–3.49, p = 0.025] and healthcare neglect [AOR = 2.35, 95%CI: 1.37–4.02, p = 0.002] were independent predictors of T&CM use among EVD survivors. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest EVD-related stigma (internalised and enacted) is prevalent among EVD survivors since their return to their communities. Religiosity, perceived health status and region were identified as independent predictors of internalised stigma. Verbal abuse and healthcare neglect predict informal healthcare use.

In this study we aimed at exploring the eating habits and sleep quality of the adult population of Ecuador during the mandatory confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a cross-sectional study, which used an online survey that included questions about eating habits and sleeping habits in adults (n = 9522) between 18–69 years old. The Pittsburg sleep quality questionnaire validated for the Hispanic population was used, and questions about dietary habits. The statistical test Chi-square statistical test was used to analyze the data. The results show that sleep quality differs according to sex, being worse in women, both in all components of sleep quality and in the total score (p < 0.001). Women had greater changes in the habitual consumption of food compared to men (24.24% vs. 22.53%), and people between 18 and 40 years of age decreased their food consumption in relation to people >40 years (24.06% vs. 17.73%). Our results indicate that mandatory confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ecuador has generated changes in the eating habits and sleep quality in the adult population sampled, and these changes are more noticeable in women and young adults.

The present study investigated changes after the COVID-19 confinement in maximal oxygen intake (VO(2) max) levels in a sample of 89 Spanish school children aged 12 and 14 years at baseline (49.8% girls). The 20-m shuttle run test served to estimate VO(2) max before and after the COVID-19 confinement. Paired t-tests estimated an overall difference of − 0.5 ml.kg(−1).min(−1) (SD 0.3) (p = 0.12), whereas the highest significant reductions were observed for girls aged 14 years (− 1.5 ml.kg(−1).min(−1) (SD 0.6) (p < 0.05)). Boys aged 14 years showed a slight increase (0.4 ml.kg(−1).min(−1) (SD 0.5) (p = 0.44)), whereas boys aged 12 years presented an important decrease (− 1.2 ml.kg(−1).min(−1) (SD 0.7) (p = 0.14)). Healthy Fitness Zone (HFZ) levels also experienced a decrease of − 3.4% as regards baseline levels over the examined period. All the examined subgroups showed lower levels in relation to a normal VO(2) max rate development, although girls aged 14 and boys aged 12 years accounted for the highest part. Conclusion: The results indicate that COVID-19 confinement might delay the normal development of VO(2) max in adolescents.

We aimed to investigate the prevalence of insomnia and identify its associated factors among truck drivers in Japan. METHODS: Participants were 2927 male truck drivers younger than 65 years old. Self-administered questionnaires were used to assess insomnia symptoms, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, drinking, smoking habits, body mass index, caffeine intake, as well as daily driving hours, consecutive days away from home, and driving distance. Insomnia symptoms included difficulty initiating sleep, maintaining sleep and early morning awakening. Insomnia was defined when any of these symptoms were observed with daily tiredness. RESULTS: The prevalence of insomnia among the subjects was 13.3% (n=356), of which 13.5% had difficulty initiating sleep, 78% had difficulty maintaining sleep, and 26.4% had early morning awakening. After adjusting for covariates, drinking habits, daily driving hours, and STAI score were significantly and linearly associated with insomnia; the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of drinking habits for insomnia was 1.74 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.23–2.47] for heavy drinkers compared to non-drinkers (trend p<0.001); the adjusted OR of daily driving hours was 1.87 (95% CI, 1.00–3.49) for 12 hours or longer in a day compared to <8 hours in a day (trend p<0.001); the adjusted OR of STAI quartiles was 5.30 (95% CI, 3.66–7.67) for the highest quartile compared to the lowest quartile (trend p<0.001).

Climate change and global pandemic as the crisis in health and equality,2020-11-07,"Summary Neonatal intensive care units are vulnerable to outbreaks and sporadic incidents of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). The incidence and outcome of these infections are determined by the degree of immaturity of the neonatal immune system, invasive procedures involved, the aetiological agent and its antimicrobial susceptibility pattern and, above all, infection control policies practised by the unit. It is important to raise awareness of infection control practices in resource-limited settings, since overdependence upon antimicrobial agents and co-existing lack of awareness of infection control is encouraging the emergence of multi-drug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. We reviewed 125 articles regarding HAIs from both advanced and resource-limited neonatal units in order to study risk factors, aetiological agents, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and reported successes in infection control interventions. The articles include surveillance studies, outbreaks and sporadic incidents. Gram-positive cocci, viruses and fungi predominate in reports from the advanced units, while Gram-negative enteric rods, non-fermenters and fungi are commonly reported from resource-limited settings. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns from surveillance studies determined the empirical therapy used in each neonatal unit. Most outbreaks, irrespective of the technical facilities available, were traced to specific lack of infection control practices. We discuss infection control interventions, with special emphasis on their applicability in resource-limited settings. Cost-effective measures for implementing these interventions, with particular reference to the recognition of the role of the microbiologist, the infection control team and antibiotic policies are presented.","Srivastava, S.; Shetty, N.",Journal of Hospital Infection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17350726/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670107000400; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670107000400,394
657441,Machine Learning Approaches Reveal That the Number of Tests Do Not Matter to the Prediction of Global Confirmed COVID-19 Cases,2020-11-23,"BACKGROUND: The association between respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) loads and clinical outcomes in children remains to be defined. In most studies, viral loads (VL) were evaluated in hospitalized children and at a single time-point. We investigated the relationship between VLs and disease severity in both outpatients and inpatients with RSV infection. METHODS: We enrolled previously healthy children with RSV infection. Disease severity was defined by level of care (outpatients vs ward vs pediatric intensive care unit [PICU]), and a clinical disease severity score (CDSS). Nasopharyngeal VLs by polymerase chain reaction and CDSS were measured at enrollment and daily in inpatients. VL decay according to disease severity was analyzed using linear mixed modeling. RESULTS: From February 2015 to March 2017, we enrolled 150 infants: 39 outpatients and 111 inpatients. VLs were higher in outpatients than in age-matched inpatients. Among inpatients, initial VLs were comparable in ward and PICU patients, and preceded the peak CDSS. However, after excluding infants treated with steroids, those hospitalized in the ward had higher VLs than infants requiring PICU care (P < .001). Dynamic analyses showed that VL decay was delayed in PICU patients, especially in those treated with steroids. CONCLUSIONS: Higher VLs at presentation and a faster and consistent VL decline were both associated with less severe RSV disease in children. SUMMARY: Infants with less severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease had higher viral loads (VL) at presentation, and faster and consistent VL decline. Conversely, VL decay and overall viral exposure were prolonged and higher in infants severe RSV disease receiving steroids.","Garcia-Mauriño, Cristina; Moore-Clingenpeel, Melissa; Thomas, Jessica; Mertz, Sara; Cohen, Daniel M; Ramilo, Octavio; Mejias, Asuncion",J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiy655; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30418604/,394

Here we present a bioinformatics approach to predict and model the phases of COVID so that effective treatment strategies can be devised and monitored. We investigated 144 individuals including normal individuals and patients spanning the COVID-19 disease continuum. We collected plasma and isolated PBMCs from 29 normal individuals, 26 individuals with mild-moderate COVID-19, 25 individuals with severe COVID-19, and 64 individuals with Chronic COVID-19 symptoms. Immune subset profiling and a 14-plex cytokine panel were run on all patients. Data was analyzed using machine learning methods to predict and distinguish the groups from each other.Using a multi-class deep neural network classifier to better fit our prediction model, we recapitulated a 100% precision, 100% recall and F1 score of 1 on the test set. Moreover, a first score specific for the chronic COVID-19 patients was defined as S1 = (IFN-γ + IL-2)/ CCL4-MIP-1β. Second, a score specific for the severe COVID-19 patients was defined as S2 = (10*IL-10 + IL-6) - (IL-2 + IL-8). Severe cases are characterized by excessive inflammation and dysregulated T cell activation, recruitment, and counteracting activities. While chronic patients are characterized by a profile able to induce the activation of effector T cells with pro-inflammatory properties and the capacity of generating an effective immune response to eliminate the virus but without the proper recruitment signals to attract activated T cells.

Group testing could be a promising candidate for screening to save time and resources. However, due to the high false-negative rate (FNR) of the RT-PCR diagnostic test, we should be cautious about using group testing because a group's false-negative result identifies all the individuals in a group as uninfected. Repeating the test is the best solution to reduce the FNR, and repeats should be integrated with the group-testing method to increase the sensitivity of the test. The simplest way is to replicate the test twice for each group (the 2Rgt method). In this paper, we present a new method for group testing (the groupMix method), which integrates two repeats in the test. Then we introduce the 2-stage sequential version of both the groupMix and the 2Rgt methods. We compare these methods analytically regarding the sensitivity and the average number of tests. The tradeoff between the sensitivity and the average number of tests should be considered when choosing the best method for the screening strategy. We applied the groupMix method to screening 263 people and identified 2 infected individuals by performing 98 tests. This method achieved a 63% saving in the number of tests compared to individual testing. Our experimental results show that in COVID-19 screening, the viral load can be low, and the group size should not be more than 6; otherwise, the FNR increases significantly.

After imputation for missing data, we calculated unadjusted and adjusted prevalence ratio, and regression coefficient for factors associated with early hospital death and survival duration. Of the 20,641 COVID-19 deaths analyzed, a) 14,684 (71.1%) were males; b) 10,134 (50.9%) were aged < 65 years; c) 9,722 (47.1%) treated at public hospitals and d) 5405 (27.1%) were early hospital deaths. Breathlessness was the most common presenting complaint. Diabetes (11,075,53.7%), hypertension (95,77,46.5%) and coronary artery disease (2,821,13.7%) were the common comorbidities. After adjustment, early hospital death was significantly higher among patients aged <65 years, without severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) at admission, non-diabetics, and cared at public hospitals compared to their counterparts. Similarly, the survival duration was at least one day higher among patients presented with SARI, chronic liver disease and cared at a private hospital. The analysis covered >10% of India's COVID-19 deaths, providing essential information regarding the COVID-19 epidemiology. The characteristics associated with early hospital death and survival duration among the COVID-19 fatalities may be deliberated as markers for prognosis and compared with survivors.","Gandhi Periyasamy, Aravind; Kathirvel, Soundappan; Rehman, Tanveer; Singh, Amarjeet",Monaldi arch. chest dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34523324/; https://doi.org/10.4081/monaldi.2021.1890,394

Although hip and knee arthroplasty surgeons are not at the center of the epidemic and it may seem our role is limited, there are and will be many opportunities to contribute. During international crises such as these, the less fortunate are the most significantly affected. We highlight the value of humanitarian medical work, contributions of the hip and knee arthroplasty community to date, and future needs following the resolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. We polled members of medical mission group lead by arthroplasty surgeons to understand their efforts and benefits they have received doing humanitarian work. Google Search and PubMed were used to find articles relevant to the current environment of the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to understand how the arthroplasty community can contribute, based on historical lessons from prior pandemics and recessions, current needs and projections of the COVID-19 impact. We conclude that there will be a great need for humanitarian work, and as in the current time, the immediate need globally may not be in our subspecialty.","Khanuja, Harpal S.; Chaudhry, Yash P.; Sheth, Neil P.; Oni, Julius K.; Parsley, Brian S.; Morrison, J.

This work analysed the utilisation of IC in New Zealand (NZ) between 2010 and 2020, as a base to predict and plan the health service in the future. METHODS: Inpatient events from NZ national data collection and datasets from the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society were matched to generate a relatively comprehensive IC dataset for patients cared in NZ. RESULTS: Over the period, around 182,000 IC inpatient events with associated 12.1 million IC hours were identified. For NZ patients, age-standardised rate was 328 events or 905 IC bed days per 100,000 population. The age-standardised rates were significantly higher in Maori and Pacific, and significantly lower in Asian population. The absolute IC events and IC hours significantly increased over the period, with a slope of 390 IC events or 29,000 IC hours per year. Significant increase in IC hours over the period were found in the diagnostic categories of injuries, cardiovascular diseases, neurological conditions and lower respiratory infections; or patients cared by health specialties of cardiothoracic surgery, general surgery, orthopaedic surgery and respiratory medicine. CONCLUSIONS: The IC utilisation are different in population subgroups. Trends and volumes of IC utilisation in different clinical diagnoses and health specialties were quantified. KEY MESSAGES: With population projection, these results provide evidence to predict IC capacity demand and to design IC services (e.g. health specialties, IC beds and investment needed) in the future.","Zhang, Zhi-ling (jim); Balram, Astuti",Int J Epidemiol,https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyab168.756,394
661400,Covid-19 Epidemiological Factor Analysis: Identifying Principal Factors with Machine Learning,2020-06-05,"Background: Successful pharmacy curricula expose students to a variety of teaching and assessment methods to prepare students for clinical practice. However, development of clinical decision-making skills is often challenging for learners. To meet this need, the Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA) Patient Case Format was developed to enhance traditional paper patient cases by integrating problem-based and case-based learning to improve pharmacy student learning. The objectives of this evaluation were to qualitatively evaluate the CYOA case format. The qualitative assessment of the student pharmacist’s learning experience utilizing this novel patient case format was used to formulate a template for extrapolation to other disease states. Methods: Focus groups were conducted with second year Pharm.D. students enrolled at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC) College of Pharmacy. The focus groups were conducted in Fall 2020, beginning the week after they were exposed to the CYOA case format. The corpus of data was analyzed thematically to identify themes using inductive coding. To establish the validity of this evaluation, the team met to assess the consistency of the data reduction methods and guard against methodological issues that could influence and affect coding decisions. Results: Participants were recruited until thematic saturation was achieved. Out of 25 participants, 23 participants provided demographic information, with 74% identifying as female. Thematic analysis identified three themes: (1) “It was just fun!” (2) Empowering Pharmacy Students through Groupwork: “Collaboration [is] going to be vital” and (3) Meeting the Need for Real-Life Scenarios: “This is a real person.” Conclusions: The data highlight that there are numerous advantages of adopting the CYOA format for delivering applied pharmacotherapy content. The CYOA format presents students with a realistic scenario that is fun and engaging and challenges students to justify their decisions regarding patient care in a structured group environment.","Scott, Devin; Cernasev, Alina; Kiles, Tyler Marie",Pharmacy (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34564558/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmacy9030151,394

If it exceeds 1, the number of incident cases will inevitably grow over time, and a large epidemic is possible. To prevent the expansion of an epidemic, R must be reduced to a level below 1. To estimate the reproduction number, the probability distribution function of the generation interval of an infectious disease is required to be available; however, this distribution is often unknown. In this letter, given the incomplete information for the generation interval, we propose a maximum entropy method to estimate the reproduction number. Based on this method, given the mean value and variance of the generation interval, we first determine its probability distribution function and in turn estimate the real-time values of reproduction number of COVID-19 in China. By applying these estimated reproduction numbers into the susceptible-infectious-removed epidemic model, we simulate the evolutionary track of the epidemic in China, which is well in accordance with that of the real incident cases. The simulation results predict that China's epidemic will gradually tend to disappear by May 2020 if the quarantine measures can continue to be executed.","Tao, Yong",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.14.20035659,394

The main goals of the proposed system are to identify and inform irregular and improper posture to prevent sitting-related health issues such as pressure ulcers, with the potential that it could also be used for individuals without mobility issues. In the proposed monitoring system, an array of 16 screen printed pressure sensor units was employed to obtain pressure data, which are sampled and processed in real-time using read-out electronics. The posture recognition was performed for four sitting positions: right-, left-, forward- and backward leaning based on k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), support vector machines (SVM), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT) and LightGBM machine learning algorithms. As a result, a posture classification accuracy of up to 99.03 percent can be achieved. Experimental studies illustrate that the system can provide real-time pressure distribution value in the form of a pressure map on a standard PC and also on a raspberry pi system equipped with a touchscreen monitor. The stored pressure distribution data can later be shared with healthcare professionals so that abnormalities in sitting patterns can be identified by employing a post-processing unit. The proposed system could be used for risk assessments related to pressure ulcers. It may be served as a benchmark by recording and identifying individuals’ sitting patterns and the possibility of being realized as a lightweight portable health monitoring device.","Ahmad, Jawad; Sidén, Johan; Andersson, Henrik",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34640669/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21196349,394
665953,A Message from the Guest Editor.,2021-05-01,"INTRODUCTION: Intractable hiccups frequently result from an underlying pathology and can cause considerable illness in the patients. Initial remedies such as drinking cold water, induction of emesis, carotid sinus massage or Valsalva manoeuvre all seem to work by over stimulating the Vagus nerve. Pharmacotherapy with baclofen, gabapentin and other centrally and peripherally acting agents such as chlorpromazine and metoclopramide are reserved as second line treatment. Medical refractory cases even indulge in unconventional therapies such as hypnosis, massages and acupuncture. Surgical intervention, although undertaken very rarely, predominantly revolves around phrenic nerve crushing, blockade or pacing. A novel surgical strategy is emerging in the form of Vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) placement with three cases cited in literature to date with varying degrees of success. Here the authors report a case of VNS placement for intractable hiccups with partial success, in accordance with SCARE-2018 guidelines. PRESENTATION OF THE CASE: An 85-year-old gentleman with a 9-year history of intractable hiccups secondary to pneumonia came to our hospital. The hiccups were symptomatic causing anorexia, insomnia, irritability, depression, exhaustion, muscle wasting and weight loss. The patient underwent countless medical evaluations. All examinations and investigations yielded normal results. The patient underwent aggressive pharmacotherapy, home remedies and unconventional therapies for intractable hiccups but to no avail. He also underwent left phrenic nerve blocking and resection without therapeutic success. The patient presented to our hospital and decision for VNS insertion was taken for compassionate reasons considering patient morbidity. The patient demonstrated significant improvement in his symptoms following VNS insertion. DISCUSSION: A temporary hiccup is an occasional happening experienced by everyone. However, intractable hiccups are associated with significant morbidity and often mortality. Several medical, pharmacological, surgical and novel treatment options are available for intractable hiccups. CONCLUSION: VNS insertion is a novel surgical option for the treatment of intractable hiccups.","Tariq, Kanza; Das, Joe M.; Monaghan, Sasha; Miserocchi, Anna; McEvoy, Andrew",Int J Surg Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33360634/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2020.12.023,394
666242,Modelling the Spread of the Coronavirus: A View from Economics,2021-01-27,"The emergence of a novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans, is affecting all countries of the world and has become a global health concern. Since the virus was first identified in December 2019, the number of deaths have been propagating exponentially, causing countries across the world, including Malaysia, to increase emergency measures to combat the virus. Due to the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic does not discriminate its victims, it is of paramount importance to construct a plan for management of the dead for all suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases, including the unidentified deceased, as an essential portion of the humanitarian forensic action approach. This document provides an overview on ways to maximize the local collective capacity from various government agencies to manage the dead based on the prevailing regulations and legislation in the country, in preparation for possible large scale deaths from this pandemic. The National Institute of Forensic Medicine Malaysia has improvised procedures and guidelines for management of the dead within the existing regulations in order to achieve a balance between medicolegal requirements and the safety of personnel managing the bodies of the deceased with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection; at the site of death, during transport, during postmortem procedures, storage and preparation before and during burial or cremation as well as environmental cleaning and disinfection, involving various agencies in the country. A form of temporary controlled burial is as an option to allow the reinvestigation of a decedent to help formally identify victims of the pandemic such as undocumented migrants or refugees who were previously not identified. Due to the different legal requirements and mortality rates between countries, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to the management of the dead. Whenever possible, every opportunity and assistance must be given to families to mourn their loved ones, even in times of crisis or an outbreak, in order to sustain an appropriate level of dignity and respect.","Khoo, Lay See; Hasmi, Ahmad Hafizam; Ibrahim, Mohamad Azaini; Mahmood, Mohd Shah",Forensic Sci Med Pathol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12024-020-00269-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32519316/,394
666795,The Influence of Political Regime on State-Level Disciplinary Actions of CPAs Sanctioned by the PCAOB,2021-01-19,"OBJECTIVES: Being able to predict which patients with COVID-19 are going to deteriorate is important to help identify patients for clinical and research practice. Clinical prediction models play a critical role in this process, but current models are of limited value because they are typically restricted to baseline predictors and do not always use contemporary statistical methods. We sought to explore the benefits of incorporating dynamic changes in routinely measured biomarkers, non-linear effects and applying ‘state-of-the-art’ statistical methods in the development of a prognostic model to predict death in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. DESIGN: The data were analysed from admissions with COVID-19 to three hospital sites. Exploratory data analysis included a graphical approach to partial correlations. Dynamic biomarkers were considered up to 5 days following admission rather than depending solely on baseline or single time-point data. Marked departures from linear effects of covariates were identified by employing smoothing splines within a generalised additive modelling framework. SETTING: 3 secondary and tertiary level centres in Greater Manchester, the UK. PARTICIPANTS: 392 hospitalised patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19. RESULTS: 392 patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis were identified. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve increased from 0.73 using admission data alone to 0.75 when also considering results of baseline blood samples and to 0.83 when considering dynamic values of routinely collected markers. There was clear non-linearity in the association of age with patient outcome. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that clinical prediction models to predict death in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 can be improved by taking into account both non-linear effects in covariates such as age and dynamic changes in values of biomarkers.","Berzuini, Carlo; Hannan, Cathal; King, Andrew; Vail, Andy; O'Leary, Claire; Brough, David; Galea, James; Ogungbenro, Kayode; Wright, Megan; Pathmanaban, Omar; Hulme, Sharon; Allan, Stuart; Bernardinelli, Luisa; Patel, Hiren C",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-041983; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32967887/,394

The aim of this study was to expand our knowledge on the main drivers of malaria in Spain. In the case of autochthonous malaria, these drivers were linked to socioeconomic and hygienic and sanitary conditions, especially in rural areas due to their close proximity to the wetlands that provide an important habitat for anopheline reproduction. In the case of imported malaria, the main drivers were associated with urban areas, a high population density and international communication nodes (e.g. airports). Another relevant aspect is that the major epidemic episodes of the twentieth century were strongly influenced by war and military conflicts and overcrowding of the healthcare system due to the temporal overlap with the pandemic flu of 1918. Therefore, military conflicts and overlap with other epidemics or pandemics are considered to be drivers of malaria that can—in a temporary manner—exponentially intensify transmission of the disease. Climatic factors did not play a relevant role as drivers of malaria in Spain (at least directly). However, they did influence the seasonality of the disease and, during the epidemic outbreak of 1940–1944, the climate conditions favored or coadjuvated its spread. The results of this study provide additional knowledge on the seasonal and interannual variability of malaria that can help to develop and implement health risk control measures.

It is a highly infectious disease, wherein the virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) rapidly multiplies and spreads to all parts of the body. Therefore, COVID-19 is not only respiratory disease but also a multisystem disease. Many people, including physicians, incorrectly believe that the disease affects only the respiratory tract. In this study, we aimed to describe COVID-19 manifestations and the underlying pathophysiology to provide the readers with a better understanding of this disease to achieve good management and to control the spread of this disease. Methods: Secondary data were obtained from PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases. The keywords used for the search were as follows: COVID-19, COVID-19 pulmonary manifestations, COVID-19 extra pulmonary manifestations, and pathophysiology of COVID-19. We collected secondary data from systemic reviews, metaanalyses, case series, and case reports in the form of public data that was published on websites of the government, medical corporations, medical peer-reviewed journals, and medical academies, all of which were indexed in PubMed, Google Scholar, or Scopus. Our questions were as follows: Is COVID-19 a respiratory disease only? and What are the extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19? Results: From our data, we found that a patient with COVID-19 may be either asymptomatic or symptomatic. Symptomatic cases may have either pulmonary or extrapulmonary manifestations. Pulmonary manifestations occur as mild, moderate, or severe cases. In mild and moderate cases, extrapulmonary manifestations such as gastroenteritis, fever, or vomiting may present alone. Some of these cases may be missed for diagnosis, and the patient may receive symptomatic treatment without a COVID-19 diagnosis, leading to increased spread of the infection. Extrapulmonary manifestations may occur in severe and critical cases as complications of severe infections (high viral overload) or the cytokine storm, such as in acute kidney injury (AKI), heart failure (HF), and venous thromboembolic (VTE) manifestation. Conclusion: COVID-19 is not a respiratory disease alone; rather, it is a multisystem disease. Pulmonary and extrapulmonary manifestations should be considered for early diagnosis and to control the spread of the infection.","Elrobaa, Islam H.; New, Karl J.",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34650947/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.711616,394

IFITM3 gene encoding for interferon inducible transmembrane protein 3, is located at 11p15. It acts as an effector molecule for interferon-gamma, which is essential for anti-tuberculosis immune response. In order to investigate the association between susceptibility to TB and genetic polymorphisms of the IFITM3 core promoter, a case-control study including 368 TB patients and 794 healthy controls was performed in Han Chinese children in northern China. The rs3888188 polymorphism showed significant association with susceptibility to TB. The rs3888188 G allele, acting recessively, was more frequent in TB patients (95% confidence interval: 1.08–1.56, Bonferroni P-value: 0.039). We further assessed the effect of rs3888188 polymorphism on IFITM3 transcription in vitro. As based on luciferase promoter assays, the promoter activity of haplotypes with rs3888188 G allele was lower than that of haplotypes with rs3888188 T allele. Moreover, peripheral-blood mononuclear cells carrying rs3888188 GG genotype showed a reduced IFITM3 mRNA level compared to cells carrying TT or GT genotype. In conclusion, rs3888188, a functional promoter polymorphism of IFITM3, was identified to influence the risk for pediatric TB in Han Chinese population.","Shen, Chen; Wu, Xi-rong; Jiao, Wei-wei; Sun, Lin; Feng, Wei-xing; Xiao, Jing; Miao, Qing; Liu, Fang; Yin, Qing-qin; Zhang, Chen-guang; Guo, Ya-jie; Shen, A-dong",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0067816; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23874452/,394
672112,"Crime and coronavirus: social distancing, lockdown, and the mobility elasticity of crime",2020-07-06,"BACKGROUND: Acute healthcare utilization attributed to alcohol use disorders (AUD) and other substance use disorders (SUD) is rising. OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence and characteristics of emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations made by adults with AUD or SUD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Observational study with retrospective analysis of the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (2014 to 2018), a nationally representative survey of acute care visits with information on the presence of AUD or SUD abstracted from the medical chart. MAIN MEASURES: Outcome measured as the presence of AUD or SUD. KEY RESULTS: From 2014 to 2018, the annual average prevalence of AUD or SUD was 9.4% of ED visits (9.3 million visits) and 11.9% hospitalizations (1.4 million hospitalizations). Both estimates increased over time (30% and 57% relative increase for ED visits and hospitalizations, respectively, from 2014 to 2018). ED visits and hospitalizations from individuals with AUD or SUD, compared to individuals with neither AUD nor SUD, had higher percentages of Medicaid insurance (ED visits: AUD: 33.1%, SUD: 35.0%, neither: 24.4%; hospitalizations: AUD: 30.7%, SUD: 36.3%, neither: 14.8%); homelessness (ED visits: AUD: 6.2%, SUD 4.4%, neither 0.4%; hospitalizations: AUD: 5.9%, SUD 7.3%, neither: 0.4%); coexisting depression (ED visits: AUD: 26.3%, SUD 24.7%, neither 10.5%; hospitalizations: AUD: 33.5%, SUD 35.3%, neither: 13.9%); and injury/trauma (ED visits: AUD: 51.3%, SUD 36.3%, neither: 26.4%; hospitalizations: AUD: 31.8%, SUD: 23.8%, neither: 15.0%). CONCLUSIONS: In this nationally representative study, 1 in 11 ED visits and 1 in 9 hospitalizations were made by adults with AUD or SUD, and both increased over time. These estimates are higher or similar than previous national estimates using claims data. This highlights the importance of identifying opportunities to address AUD and SUD in acute care settings in tandem with other medical concerns, particularly among visits presenting with injury, trauma, or coexisting depression.

One of the most important aspects of IHR 2005 is the establishment of a global surveillance system for public health emergencies of international concern. This article assesses the surveillance system in IHR 2005 by applying well-established frameworks for evaluating public health surveillance. The assessment shows that IHR 2005 constitutes a major advance in global surveillance from what has prevailed in the past. Effectively implementing the IHR 2005 surveillance objectives requires surmounting technical, resource, governance, legal, and political obstacles. Although IHR 2005 contains some provisions that directly address these obstacles, active support by the World Health Organization and its member states is required to strengthen national and global surveillance capabilities.","Baker, Michael G.; Fidler, David P.",Emerg Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16836821/,394

We describe the set-up of the VITOM® exoscope system based on our 5 years’ experience of using it as an effective intraoperative video imaging and teaching modality for extraocular surgery. METHODS: The VITOM® is a specially designed exoscope mounted onto a versatile mechanical arm. It is attached to a high definition (HD) digital camera displayed on the HD video monitor of a standard endoscopy stack. This technology has been utilised in other surgical subspecialties, but there is no documented use within extraocular surgery. RESULTS: The exoscope was simple to set-up and allowed real-time recording and editing with an HD image display system. The theatre team were able to view the precise surgical steps, contributing to improved theatre flow. Trainees reported that the VITOM® images significantly improved their visualisation and understanding of key surgical anatomy and steps. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience showed that the VITOM® exoscope is an excellent intraoperative video imaging and teaching aid, as it allows real-time capture and editing of open surgery and seems to improve theatre flow. With newer models using 3D stereoscopic vision, it could be further evaluated as a heads-up viewing system within extraocular and oculoplastic surgery.","Kadaba, V.; Shafi, F.; Ahluwalia, H.

673475,Towards Using Graph Analytics for Tracking Covid-19,2020-12-31,"The RNA pseudoknot that stimulates −1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting in SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a possible drug target. To understand how this 3-stemmed pseudoknot responds to the mechanical tension applied by ribosomes during translation, which is thought to play a key role during frame-shifting, we probed its structural dynamics under tension using optical tweezers. Unfolding curves revealed that the frameshift signal formed multiple different structures: at least two distinct pseudoknotted conformers with different unfolding forces and energy barriers, as well as alternative stem-loop structures. Refolding curves showed that stem 1 formed first in the pseudoknotted conformers, followed by stem 3 and then stem 2. By extending the handle holding the RNA to occlude the 5′ end of stem 1, the proportion of the different pseudoknot conformers could be altered systematically, consistent with structures observed in cryo-EM images and computational simulations that had distinct topologies: the 5′ end of the RNA threaded through the 3-helix junction to form a ring-knot, or unthreaded as in more standard H-type pseudoknots. These results resolve the folding mechanism of the frameshift signal in SARS-CoV-2 and highlight the dynamic conformational heterogeneity of this RNA, with important implications for structure-based drug-discovery efforts.","Neupane, Krishna; Zhao, Meng; Lyons, Aaron; Munshi, Sneha; Ileperuma, Sandaru M.; Ritchie, Dustin B.; Hoffer, Noel Q.; Narayan, Abhishek; Woodside, Michael T.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.28.424630,394

We integrate the traditional Chinese philosophy – Yin/Yang doctrine – into the representation of the Western hormetic dose–response relationship and review the Yin/Yang historical philosophy contained in the hormesis concept, aiming to promote general acceptance and wider applications of hormesis. We suggest that the Yin/Yang doctrine embodies the hormetic dose–response, including the relationship between the opposing components, curve shape, and time-dependence, and may afford insights that clarify the hormetic dose–response relationship in toxicology and pharmacology.","Sun, Haoyu; Calabrese, Edward J.; Lin, Zhifen; Lian, Baoling; Zhang, Xiaoxian",Trends Pharmacol Sci,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165614720301280; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tips.2020.05.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32564900/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165614720301280,394

We sought to examine the satisfaction of patients with breast cancer (BC) who underwent teleconsultations during this period. METHODS: Eighteen centres in France and Italy invited patients with BC who had at least one teleconsultation during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic to participate in a web-based survey that evaluated their satisfaction (EORTC OUT-PATSAT 35 and Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire [TSQ] scores) with teleconsultation. RESULTS: Among the 1299 participants eligible for this analysis, 53% of participants were undergoing standard post-treatment follow-up while 22 and 17% were currently receiving active anticancer therapy for metastatic and localised cancers, respectively. The mean satisfaction scores were 77.4 and 73.3 for the EORTC OUT-PATSAT 35 and TSQ scores, respectively. In all, 52.6% of participants had low/no anxiety. Multivariable analysis showed that the EORTC OUT-PATSAT 35 score correlated to age, anxiety score and teleconsultation modality. The TSQ score correlated to disease status and anxiety score. CONCLUSION: Patients with BC were satisfied with oncology teleconsultations during the COVID-19 pandemic.

675445,The effects of repetition frequency on the illusory truth effect,2021-05-13,"Objective: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has radically changed the world in a few weeks. Italy has been one of the first and most affected countries with more than 30,000 deaths up to now. Public health measures as quarantine or national lockdown are necessary to limit the spread of infectious diseases, but it is unsurprising that depriving people of their liberty has negative psychological effects. This is especially the case for people with chronic diseases, including neurological conditions like multiple sclerosis (MS). People with MS (PwMS) have a higher burden of neuropsychiatric comorbidities and are known to undertake maladaptive coping strategies in stress conditions. The aim of the present study is to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on mental health of an Italian cohort of PwMS in comparison with healthy controls (HCs). Methods: A total of 60 PwMS and 50 HCs (chosen among patients' cohabitants) were asked to answer a Web-based survey. This survey inquired about the impact of COVID-19 on patient's quality of life, job, and daily routine. Mood, fatigue, and sleep quality were evaluated using the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), the Generalized Anxiety Disease 7 (GAD-7), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Results: Overall, patients had higher scores of BDI, FSS, and PSQI, and these differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05). When we looked at the subscores of the BDI, we detected a statistically significant difference for the neurovegetative part—that concerns with sleep, appetite, sex, and quality of sleep (p < 0.05). One out of five patients reported new symptoms or worsening of known symptom, in particular, sensory disturbances, and fatigue. However, no symptoms were severe enough to require hospitalization. When we looked for correlations among variables, we found that there was a significant relationship between unemployment and BDI total score, GAD-7, and PSQI in MS group. The presence of new symptoms or the worsening of symptoms positively related to FSS and to PSQI. Discussion: We identified that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic had a significant impact on the psychological status of patients with MS. Compared with the general population, PwMS presented a higher burden of depressive symptoms, a worse sleep quality and perceived an increase in fatigue level, one of the most disabling symptoms of MS. The COVID-19 epidemic poses a challenge to psychological resilience. More studies are warranted to better understand the long-term consequences of the pandemic on mental health of vulnerable people during the disease outbreaks.","Motolese, Francesco; Rossi, Mariagrazia; Albergo, Giuliano; Stelitano, Domenica; Villanova, Marialucia; Di Lazzaro, Vincenzo; Capone, Fioravante",Front Neurol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.580507; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33193033/,394

Thus, we used zebrafish to evaluate the effects of parental whole-life cycle exposure to bisphenol A and its analogs (bisphenol S and F) on offspring innate immunity. At adulthood, offspring were examined with/without continued chemicals treatment until 72 h post-fertilization (hpf). To measure offspring immune function, larvae at 72 hpf were expose for 24 h with/without the viral mimic polyinosinic-cytidylic acid (Poly I:C) or the bacterial mimic Pam3Cys-Ser-Lys4 (PAM3CSK4). Data show modified immunity in offspring. Specifically, lysozyme activity was significantly induced in F1 larvae and respiratory burst response and oxidative defense genes were inhibited. Genes of the innate immune system including Toll-like receptors and their downstream molecules and inflammatory cytokines were significantly down-regulated, whereas matrix metalloproteinases were up-regulated in larvae. In addition, recombination-activating genes in the immature adaptive immune system were significantly reduced. Thus, immune defense is diminished by exposing parental generations of zebrafish to environmentally relevant concentration of bisphenols and this suggests that fish chronically exposed to bisphenols in the wild may be vulnerable to pathogens.","Dong, Xing; Zhang, Zhen; Meng, Shunlong; Pan, Chenyuan; Yang, Ming; Wu, Xiangyang; Yang, Liuqing; Xu, Hai",Sci Total Environ,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969717320557; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.08.057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28806546/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969717320557,394

Ever since the outbreak was declared, the medical fraternity across the world is facing a unique situation of offering assistance and simultaneously generating reliable data with high-quality evidence to extend the scope of finding a treatment. With no proven vaccine or other interventions available hitherto, there is a frenzied urgency of sharing preliminary data from laboratories and trials to shape a global response against the virus. Several clinical trials with investigational and approved repurposed therapeutics have shown promising results. This review aims to compile the information of the reported molecules approved for emergency use and those under clinical trials and still others with good results in the studies conducted so far. Being an RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 is prone to mutation; thus, the possibility of gaining resistance to available drugs is high. Consequently, a cocktail therapy based on drug interaction with different stages of its replicative cycle is desirable to reduce the chances of evolving drug resistance.

Hence, this study aims to explore perceived infection routes, influencing factors, psychosocial changes, and management procedures for COVID-19 infected healthcare workers. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional, single hospital-based study. We recruited all 105 confirmed COVID-19 healthcare workers in the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from February 15 to 29, 2020. All participants completed a validated questionnaire. Electronic consent was obtained from all participants. Perceived causes of infection, infection prevention, control knowledge and behaviour, psychological changes, symptoms and treatment were measured. RESULTS: Finally, 103 professional staff with COVID-19 finished the questionnaire and was included (response rate: 98.1%). Of them, 87 cases (84.5%) thought they were infected in working environment in hospital, one (1.0%) thought their infection was due to the laboratory environment, and 5 (4.9%) thought they were infected in daily life or community environment. Swab of throat collection and physical examination were the procedures perceived as most likely causing their infection by nurses and doctors respectively. Forty-three (41.8%) thought their infection was related to protective equipment, utilization of common equipment (masks and gloves). The top three first symptoms displayed before diagnosis were fever (41.8%), lethargy (33.0%) and muscle aches (30.1%). After diagnosis, 88.3% staff experienced psychological stress or emotional changes during their isolation period, only 11.7% had almost no emotional changes. Arbidol (Umifenovir; an anti-influza drug; 69.2%) was the drug most commonly used to target infection in mild and moderate symptoms. CONCLUSION: The main perceived mode of transmission was not maintaining protection when working at a close distance and having intimate contact with infected cases. Positive psychological intervention is necessary.","Jin, Ying-Hui; Huang, Qiao; Wang, Yun-Yun; Zeng, Xian-Tao; Luo, Li-Sha; Pan, Zhen-Yu; Yuan, Yu-Feng; Chen, Zhi-Min; Cheng, Zhen-Shun; Huang, Xing; Wang, Na; Li, Bing-Hui; Zi, Hao; Zhao, Ming-Juan; Ma, Lin-Lu; Deng, Tong; Wang, Ying; Wang, Xing-Huan",Mil Med Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40779-020-00254-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32393381/,394

A stochastic version of the SEIR model CovidSIM v1.1, designed specifically for COVID-19 was utilised. We first considered historical data for Australia before it eliminated COVID-19 (equivalent to an outbreak generating 74 new cases/day) and one flight per day to NZ with no interventions in place. This gave a median time to an outbreak of 0.2 years (95% range of simulation results: 3 days to 1.1 years) or a mean of 110 flights per outbreak. However, the combined use of a pre-flight PCR test of saliva, three subsequent PCR tests (on days 1, 3 and 12 in NZ), and various other interventions (mask use and contact tracing) reduced this risk to one outbreak after a median of 1.5 years (20 days to 8.1 years). A pre-flight test plus 14 days quarantine was an even more effective strategy (4.9 years; 2,594 flights). For a much lower prevalence (representing only two new community cases per week in the whole of Australia), the annual risk of an outbreak with no interventions was 1.2% and had a median time to an outbreak of 56 years. In contrast the risks associated with travellers from Japan and the United States was very much higher and would need quarantine or other restrictions. Collectively, these results suggest that multi-layered interventions can markedly reduce the risk of importing the pandemic virus via air travel into a COVID-19-free nation. For some low-risk source countries, there is the potential to replace 14-day quarantine with alternative interventions. However, all approaches require public and policy deliberation about acceptable risks, and continuous careful management and evaluation.","Wilson, Nick; Baker, Michael G.; Blakely, Tony; Eichner, Martin",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-89807-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34031465/,394

In Ethiopia, though the prevalence of hypothyroidism is high the magnitude of cognitive impairment among these patients is not known. Therefore, the current study is aimed at determining the prevalence of cognitive impairment and associated factors among adult hypothyroid patients. METHODS: An institution-based cross-sectional study was employed from February 24 to May 22, 2020, to assess the prevalence of cognitive impairment and associated factors among adult hypothyroid patients. Data was collected by a pretested interviewer-administered structured questionnaire and standardized Mini-mental state examination (SMMSE) tool. A cluster sampling technique was used. Data was entered into Epidata version 4.6 and exported into a statistical package for social science (SPSS) version 25 for further analysis. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were done. A 95% confidence interval and P-value <0.05 were used to declare statistical significance. RESULTS: A total of 216 adult hypothyroid patients were included with a response rate of 98.6%. The mean age was 42.5 (± 11) years. The prevalence of cognitive impairment was 27.3% (95% CI (21.7, 33.8)) and it was significantly associated with increased age (AOR = 1.23, 95% CI (1.11, 1.34)), increased duration of illness (AOR = 1.48, 95% CI (1.14, 1.90)) and high thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level (AOR = 1.3, 95% CI (1.1, 1.6)). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of cognitive impairment among hypothyroid patients was high. Increased age, increased duration of illness and high TSH levels were significantly associated with cognitive impairment. Hence, early screening of cognitive impairment among hypothyroid patients with increased age, increased duration of illness and high TSH level should be given due emphasis to increase patients quality of life.","Mulat, Bezawit; Ambelu, Adugnaw; Yitayih, Sewbesew; Gela, Yibeltal Yismaw; Adera, Ayechew; Yeshaw, Yigizie; Akalu, Yonas",Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33790562/; https://doi.org/10.2147/ndt.s299840,394

This study aimed to analyze the microbiome profiles using nanopore technology for full-length 16S rRNA sequencing in wastewater samples collected from a penitentiary (P), a residential care home (RCH), and a quarantine or health care facilities (HCF). During the study, the wastewater samples from the RCH and the P were negative for SARS-CoV-2 based on qPCRs, except during the fourth week when was detected. Unexpectedly, the wastewater microbiome from RCH and P prior to week four was correlated with the samples collected from the HCF, suggesting a core bacterial community is expelled from the digest tract of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. The microbiota of wastewater sample positives for SARS-CoV-2 was strongly associated with enteric bacteria previously reported in patients with risk factors for COVID-19.

680789,Quantifying COVID-19 Content in the Online Health Opinion War Using Machine Learning,2020-05-11,"BACKGROUND: An outbreak of pneumonia, COVID-19 associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan city and then rapidly spread to other cities. Wenzhou is located approximately 900 km from Wuhan, which was experiencing an outbreak that was severe at the time but is considered modest as the epidemic became a pandemic. We described the epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 outside of the epicenter to help understand the transmission pattern in a mid-sized Chinese city. METHODS: To investigate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the COVID-19, we described case series of 473 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Wenzhou, China from January 27 to March 16, 2020. We described the public health interventions of COVID-19 and evaluated the effect of interventions by the effective reproduction number (R(t)). RESULTS: The median age of all patients was 47.6 years, 48.4% of whom were female. 33.8% of the patients had a history of residence in Wuhan. Fever (71.7%) and cough (43.1%) were the most common symptoms. In addition, three kinds of unconventional cases were observed, namely 4.9% asymptomatic patients, 7.6% confirmed patients who had no link to Wuhan city but contact with individuals from Wuhan without any symptoms at the time of contact, and 12.9% confirmed patients who had an unknown source of transmission. We estimated that the basic reproductive number (R(0)) was 2.75 (95% CI: 2.37–3.23). The R(t) fluctuated within the range of 2.50 to 3.74 from January 11 to January 16 while gradually reached a peak of 3.74 on January 16. R(t) gradually decreased after January 16 and decreased to 1.00 on January 30. R(t) continually decreased and reached the lowest point (0.03) on February 21, 2020. CONCLUSION: Our study presented the possibility of asymptomatic carriers affected with SARS-CoV-2, and transmission by these three kinds of unconventional patients in Wenzhou may be an important characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The evaluation showed that a series of multifaceted interventions proved effective in controlling the epidemic of COVID-19. These findings might provide valuable examples of control policies for countries or areas in combatting the global pandemic of COVID-19.

Cleaved fragments are subsequently degraded by the cellular 5′-3′ mRNA exonuclease Xrn1, thereby suppressing cellular gene expression and facilitating viral evasion of host defenses. We reveal that mammalian cells respond to this widespread cytoplasmic mRNA decay by altering RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription in the nucleus. Measuring RNAPII recruitment to promoters and nascent mRNA synthesis revealed that the majority of affected genes are transcriptionally repressed in SOX-expressing cells. The transcriptional feedback does not occur in response to the initial viral endonuclease-induced cleavage, but instead to degradation of the cleaved fragments by cellular exonucleases. In particular, Xrn1 catalytic activity is required for transcriptional repression. Notably, viral mRNA transcription escapes decay-induced repression, and this escape requires Xrn1. Collectively, these results indicate that mRNA decay rates impact transcription, and that gamma-herpesviruses use this feedback mechanism to facilitate viral gene expression.","Abernathy, Emma; Gilbertson, Sarah; Alla, Ravi; Glaunsinger, Britt",Cell Host & Microbe,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26211836/; http://www.cell.com/article/S1931312815002929/pdf; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312815002929; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2015.06.019; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931312815002929,394

The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of sport intensity on cytokine levels, oxidative stress markers and telomere length in aging elite athletes. In this study, 80 blood samples from consenting elite athletes were collected for anti-doping analysis at an anti-doping laboratory in Italy (FMSI). Participants were divided into three groups according to their sport intensity: low-intensity skills and power sports (LI, n = 18); moderate-intensity mixed soccer players (MI, n = 31); and high-intensity endurance sports (HI, n = 31). Participants were also divided into two age groups: less than 25 (n = 45) and above 25 years old (n = 35). Serum levels of 10 pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines and two antioxidant enzymes were compared in age and sport intensity groups and telomere lengths were measured in their respective blood samples. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) was the only cytokine showing significantly higher concentration in older athletes, regardless of sport intensity. Interleukin (IL)-10 increased significantly in HI regardless of age group, whereas IL-6 concentration was higher in the older HI athletes. IL-8 showed a significant interaction with sport intensity in different age groups. Overall, significant positive correlations among levels of IL-6, IL-10, IL-8 and TNF-α were identified. The antioxidant catalase activity was positively correlated with levels of TNF-α. Telomere length increased significantly with sport intensity, especially in the younger group. HI had longer telomeres and higher levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting less aging in HI compared to low and moderate counterparts in association with heightened immune response. Investigation of the functional significance of these associations on the health and performance of elite athletes is warranted.","Sellami, Maha; Al-muraikhy, Shamma; Al-Jaber, Hend; Al-Amri, Hadaia; Al-Mansoori, Layla; Mazloum, Nayef A.; Donati, Francesco; Botre, Francesco; Elrayess, Mohamed A.",Antioxidants (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox10071035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34203235/,394

Over the past decades, it has become a simple and versatile method for nanofiber production. Hence, it has been explored in many different applications. Commonly used electrospinning assembles fibers from polymer solutions in various solvents, known as solution electrospinning, while melt and near-field electrospinning techniques enhance the versatility of electrospinning. Adaption of additive manufacturing strategy to electrospinning permits precise fiber deposition and predefining pattern construction. This manuscript critically presents the potential of electrospun nanofibers in healthcare applications. Research community drew impetus from the similarity of electrospun nanofibers to the morphology and mechanical properties of fibrous extracellular matrices (ECM) of natural human tissues. Electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds act as ECM analogs for specific tissue cells, stem cells, and tumor cells to realize tissue regeneration, stem cell differentiation, and in vitro tumor model construction. The large surface-to-volume ratio of electrospun nanofibers offers a considerable number of bioactive agents binding sites, which makes it a promising candidate for a number of biomedical applications. The applications of electrospinning in regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, controlled drug delivery, biosensors, and cancer diagnosis are elaborated.

We focused specifically on comparing a conventional ham and a new hypothetical antioxidant-enriched ham with a reduced risk of provoking colorectal cancer. Study participants were given descriptions of the two hams before carrying out successive rounds of willingness-to-pay (WTP) assessments. The results show that WTP was higher for the antioxidant-enriched ham than for the conventional ham. WTP estimates were also impacted by providing additional information about the reduction in colorectal cancer risk associated with the antioxidant-enriched ham. Based on the participants’ WTP, we came up with ex ante estimates for the social impacts of introducing the antioxidant-enriched ham onto the market, and we suggest that it would be socially optimal to promote the product. Competition arising from pre-existing product labelling and marketing assertions could greatly limit the market potential of antioxidant-enriched ham, which suggests that alternative approaches may be necessary, such as regulations mandating antioxidant enrichment.

Assuming that the demand model is of the multiplicative form and unmet demand is partially backlogged, we take the empirical Bayesian approach to formulate the problem as a stochastic dynamic program. We first identify a set of regularity conditions on demand models and show that the state-dependent base-stock list-price policy is optimal. We next employ the dimensionality reduction approach to separate the scale factor that captures observed demand information from the optimal profit function, which yields a normalized dynamic program that is more tractable. We also analyze the effect of demand learning on the optimal policy using the system without Bayesian update as a benchmark.

Both are highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, in the nasal and bronchial epithelium, as well as in the type II alveolar epithelial cells. The aim of this review is to report the evidences from the scientific literature on the pathophysiology and the available treatments for olfactory-gustatory disorders in patients with COVID-19. The mechanisms involved in these disorders are still unclear and studies on specific therapies are scarce. However, it has been hypothesized that a decrease in the sensitivity of the sensory neurons as well as the co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the alveolar epithelial cells are the main causes of olfactory-gustatory disorders. The possible mechanisms described in the literature for changes in taste perception in patients with COVID-19 include olfactory disorders and a competitive activity of COVID-19 on ACE2 receptors in the taste buds. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 can bind to sialic acid receptors in the taste buds. In general, evidences show that there is no specific treatment for olfactory-taste disorders induced by SARS-CoV-2, even though some treatments have been used and have shown some promising results, such as olfactory training, intranasal application of sodium citrate and vitamin A, as well as systemic use of omega-3 and zinc. Corticosteroids have also been used as a pharmacological approach to treat patients with olfactory dysfunction with some contradictory results.

Compliance with social distancing policies, strict return-to-play protocols, and COVID-19 specific training has, perhaps, forever changed the way that children and young people engage in organised sport. Within this context, and while many children and families seek to re-engage with community sport, we (researchers and sport practitioners) have an obligation to ask questions about how the pandemic has impacted youth sport, understand the short- and long-term consequences, and explore what (if any) opportunities can be seized to assist and improve future participation and retention. The aim of this paper was to present an in-depth exploration of the impact of COVID-19 on youth sport in South Australia. METHODS: Within an interpretive descriptive methodology, this qualitative investigation draws on rich, individual interview and focus group data with 39 youth (ages 15–18), parents, coaches, and sport administrators. A reflexive thematic analysis was undertaken, leading to the development of four substantive themes. RESULTS: We conceptualised the ‘4 Rs’ to advance theoretical understandings about the pandemic’s impact on youth sport, including the themes ‘recognising struggle’, ‘reconnection’, ‘re-engaging after restrictions, and ‘reimagining sport’. The themes captured insights about a decline in mental wellbeing and physical activity, an increase in family connectedness, the challenge for sports to attract volunteers and participants back into sport, and the opportunities to reset values and philosophies underpinning the provision of youth sport. CONCLUSION: The findings provide valuable insight into the youth sport setting as a result of the global pandemic and suggest that families, sporting clubs and sporting organisations require additional resources and tools (for example, support for parents to facilitate their children’s training at home during lockdown) to aid recovery efforts and to ensure the survival and prosperity of youth sport into the future.

The workflow of breast cancer (BC) radiotherapy (RT) in one of the hubs is presented here. METHODS: Candidates to adjuvant RT during the pandemic peak of March-April 2020 were compared to those treated in the same period of 2019, and patient volume, deferral rate, and type of RT were analyzed. Statistics were calculated with χ2 or Fisher exact tests for categorical variables, and the Wilcoxon rank test for continuous variables. RESULTS: In March-April 2020 the BC patient volume increased by 28% compared to the same period in 2019 (scheduled patients: 175 vs. 137) and amid travel restrictions it was kept high (treated patients: 136 vs. 133), mainly due to an influx from across Lombardy. RT schemes basically did not change, being already centered on hypofractionation. The increase of median time (67 vs. 74.5 days in 2019 and 2020, respectively) to the commencement of RT for low-risk patients was clinically negligible yet statistically significant (p = 0.03), and in line with the pertinent recommendations. No significant difference was found in the time interval between treatments and RT for high-risk patients. Concomitant chemoradiotherapy was avoided throughout the pandemic peak. Twenty-one women (13.6%) delayed either computed tomography simulation or RT commencement mainly because of COVID-19-related concerns and mobility restrictions. CONCLUSION: The workload for BC was high during the pandemic peak. Hubs allowed the continuation of oncologic treatments, while mitigating the strain on frontline COVID-19 hospitals.","Leonardi, Maria Cristina; Montagna, Emilia; Galimberti, Viviana Enrica; Zaffaroni, Mattia; Rojas, Damaris Patricia; Dicuonzo, Samantha; Zerella, Maria Alessia; Morra, Anna; Sangalli, Claudia; Gandini, Sara; Colleoni, Marco; Veronesi, Paolo; Gerardi, Marianna Alessandra; Alterio, Daniela; Lazzari, Roberta; Sarra Fiore, Massimo; Bufi, Giammaria; Cattani, Federica; Mastrilli, Fabrizio; Orecchia, Roberto; Jereczek-Fossa, Barbara Alicja",Breast Care (Basel),https://doi.org/10.1159/000513227; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34191930/,394

This study aimed to compare the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody level in the reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) to test positive older adults with young. Patients aged ≥18 with positive RT‐PCR and checked serum IgG antibodies between November 1, 2020 and January 13, 2021 were included. The IgG antibody levels and the time between RT‐PCR positivity with the antibody levels were recorded. A total of 1071 patients were divided into two groups as Group 1 <60 years old (n = 902) and Group 2 ≥60 years old (n = 169). The SARS‐CoV‐2 IgG antibody titers were higher in Group 2 (p = 0.001). This height was present in the first 3 months after positive RT‐PCR. While the antibody titers were compared by dividing Group 2 into the three groups according to age ranges (60–69, 70–79, and ≥80 years), the antibody titer was higher in ≥80 years patients (p = 0.044). High COVID‐19 IgG antibody levels may be associated with the severity of the disease. Also, the humoral immunity advantage was seen in the first 3 months in the older patients, which suggests that older adults with COVID‐19 may develop reinfection in the long term.","Bag Soytas, Rabia; Cengiz, Mahir; Islamoglu, Mehmet Sami; Uysal, Betul Borku; Ikitimur, Hande; Yavuzer, Hakan; Yavuzer, Serap",J Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34042191/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.27106,394
690771,The Coming Coronavirus Crisis: What Can We Learn?,2020-04-01,"BACKGROUND: The NHS has recognised the importance of a high quality patient safety culture in the delivery of primary health care in the rapidly evolving environment of general practice. Two tools, PC-SafeQuest and MapSaf, were developed with the intention of assessing and improving patient safety culture in this setting. Both have been made widely available through their inclusion in the Royal College of General Practitioners’ Patient Safety Toolkit and our work offerss a timely exploration of the tools to inform practice staff as to how each might be usefully applied and in which circumstances. Here we present a comparative analysis of their content, and describe the perspectives of staff on their design, outputs and the feasibility of their sustained use. METHODS: We have used a content analysis to provide the context for the qualitative study of staff experiences of using the tools at a representative range of practices recruited from across the Midlands (UK). Data was collected through moderated focus groups using an identical topic guide. RESULTS: A total of nine practices used the PC-SafeQuest tool and four the MapSaf tool. A total of 159 staff completed the PC-SafeQuest tool 52 of whom took part in the subsequent focus group discussions, and 25 staff completed the MapSaf tool all of whom contributed to the focus group discussions. PC-SafeQuest was perceived as quick and easy to use with direct questions pertinent to the work of GP practices providing useful quantitative insight into important areas of safety culture. Though MaPSaF was more logistically challenging, it created a forum for synchronous cross- practice discussions raising awareness of perceptions of safety culture across the practice team. CONCLUSIONS: Both tools were able to promote reflective and reflexive practice either in individual staff members or across the broader practice team and the oversight they granted provided useful direction for senior staff looking to improve patient safety. Because PC SafeQuest can be easily disseminated and independently completed it is logistically suited to larger practice organisations, whereas the MapSaf tool lends itself to smaller practices where assembling staff in a single workshop is more readily achieved.","Litchfield, Ian; Marsden, Kate; Doos, Lucy; Perryman, Katherine; Avery, Anthony; Greenfield, Sheila",BMC Fam Pract,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-021-01438-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34020597/,394
