This study aimed to take a look at changes in the daily routine of a BoNT/A outpatient clinic due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic lockdown, analyze the impact of SARS-CoV-2-induced re-injection delay on outcomes in patients with cervical dystonia (CD) (n = 36) and four other disease entities (n = 58), and study the influence of covariables, including previous injections and doses. For the present observational study, the first 100 patients who were scheduled to have an appointment between April 20 and May 18 during the partial lockdown and also had been treated regularly before the lockdown were recruited. Clinical and demographical characteristics and treatment-related data from the previous visits were extracted from charts. Time delay, symptom severity assessment, and TSUI score (if applicable) were gathered at the first coronavirus pandemic lockdown emergency visit for each patient. Of the 94 patients who could come to the clinic, 48 reported a delay and 44 reported worsening during the delay. Delays ranged from 1 to 63 days, the mean delay was 23 days, and the mean worsening was 26% compared to the previous visit. A significant correlation was found between the duration of the delay and the patient's rating of worsening (PwP). In CD patients, the physicianÂ´s rating of CD worsening by the TSUI score (ATUSI-PTSUI) was significantly correlated with general worsening (DwP) and the TSUI at the last visit (PTSUI). A small delay of a few weeks led to a similar worsening of symptoms in CD and all other disease entities and to relapse on a higher level of severity. This relapse can only be compensated by continuous treatment up to at least 1 year until patients reach the same level of treatment efficacy as that before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Samadzadeh, Sara; Brauns, Raphaela; Rosenthal, Dietmar; Hefter, Harald",Toxins (Basel),712,33
