Epigenomic dynamics during human heart organogenesis thus may play a critical role in regulating heart development. However, it is unclear how histone mark H3K36me3 acts on heart development. Here we report that histone-lysine N-methyltransferase SETD2, an H3K36me3 methyltransferase, is a crucial regulator of the mouse heart epigenome. Setd2 is highly expressed in embryonic stages and accounts for a predominate role of H3K36me3 in the heart. Loss of Setd2 in cardiac progenitors results in obvious coronary vascular defects and ventricular non-compaction, leading to fetus lethality in mid-gestation, without affecting peripheral blood vessel, yolk sac, and placenta formation. Furthermore, deletion of Setd2 dramatically decreased H3K36me3 level and impacted the transcriptional landscape of key cardiac-related genes, including Rspo3 and Flrt2. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that SETD2 plays a primary role in H3K36me3 and is critical for coronary vascular formation and heart development in mice.","Chen, Fengling; Chen, Jiewen; Wang, Hong; Tang, Huayuan; Huang, Lei; Wang, Shijia; Wang, Xinru; Fang, Xi; Liu, Jie; Li, Li; Ouyang, Kunfu; Han, Zhen",Front Cell Dev Biol,812,4

These groups may not benefit from traditional HIV prevention interventions available at the health facilities where they live, but may benefit from services offered at public venues identified as places where people meet new sexual partners (e.g. bars, nightclubs, transportation hubs and guest houses). The goal of this analysis was to estimate availability, access and uptake of prevention services by populations who visit these venues. METHODS We collected cross-sectional data using the Priorities for Local AIDS Control Efforts sampling method at cross-border locations near or along the land and lake borders of Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda from June 2016-February 2017. This bio-behavioural survey captured information from a probability sample of 11,428 individuals at 833 venues across all areas. Data were weighted using survey sampling weights and analysed using methods to account for the complex sampling design. RESULTS Among the 85.6% of persons who had access to condoms, 60.5% did not use a condom at their last anal or vaginal sexual encounter. Venues visited by high percentages of persons living with HIV were not more likely than other venues to offer condoms. In 12 of the 22 cross-border areas, male or female condoms were available at less than 33% of the venues visited by persons having difficulty accessing condoms. In 17 of the 22 cross-border areas, education outreach visits in the preceding six months occurred at less than 50% of the venues where participants had low effective use of condoms. CONCLUSIONS Individuals visiting venues in cross-border areas report poor access to and low effective use of condoms and other prevention services. Availability of HIV prevention services differed by venue and population type and cross-border area, suggesting opportunities for more granular targeting of HIV prevention interventions and transnational coordination of HIV programming.","Virkud, Arti V; Arimi, Peter; Ssengooba, Freddie; Mulholland, Grace E; Herce, Michael E; Markiewicz, Milissa; Weir, Sharon; Edwards, Jessie K",Journal of the International AIDS Society,812,1

However, pelvic floor imaging after surgery has not been reported. OBJECTIVE This study was designed to assess the outcome of patients who underwent laparoscopic ventral rectopexy for rectoanal intussusception, with special reference to the postoperative findings on evacuation proctography. DESIGN This study was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. SETTING The study was conducted from 2012 to 2013 at the Department of Surgery, Kameda Medical Center, Japan. PATIENTS We included 26 patients with symptomatic rectoanal intussusception. INTERVENTION Laparoscopic ventral rectopexy was performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Evacuation proctography was performed before and 6 months after the procedure. Defecatory function was evaluated using the Constipation Scoring System and Fecal Incontinence Severity Index. RESULTS Of 26 patients with rectoanal intussusception preoperatively, 22 had symptoms of obstructed defecation and 21 complained of fecal incontinence. Postoperatively, rectoanal intussusception was eliminated in all patients, though 8 developed recto rectal intussusception. There was an overall reduction in both grade 2 rectocele size (median preop 26 mm vs. postop 11 mm; p < 0.0001) and pelvic floor descent (median preop 26 mm vs. postop 20 mm; p < 0.0001). 6 months after surgery, a reduction of at least 50% was observed in the Constipation Scoring System score for 9 patients (41%) with obstructive defecation and in the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index score for 14 incontinent patients (67%). LIMITATIONS This was a preliminary study with a small sample size, no control group, and short follow-up time. CONCLUSION Evacuation proctography showed anatomical correction in patients with rectoanal intussusception who underwent laparoscopic ventral rectopexy. However, the data also indicate that such correction does not necessarily result in meaningful symptomatic relief.","Tsunoda, Akira; Ohta, Tomoyuki; Kiyasu, Yoshiyuki; Kusanagi, Hiroshi",Diseases of the colon and rectum,812,16

This mechanism has been recognized as a critical mediator of influenza-induced lung disease, and it could be pivotal for COVID-19 infections. Thus, an immunomodulatory approach targeting the over-production of cytokines could be proposed for viral aggressive pulmonary disease treatment. In this regard, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-ÃÂ³, a member of the PPAR transcription factor family, could represent a potential target. Beside the well-known regulatory role on lipid and glucose metabolism, PPAR-ÃÂ³ also represses the inflammatory process. Similarly, the PPAR-ÃÂ³ agonist thiazolidinediones (TZDs), like pioglitazone, are anti-inflammatory drugs with ameliorating effects on severe viral pneumonia. In addition to the pharmacological agonists, also nutritional ligands of PPAR-ÃÂ³, like curcuma, lemongrass, and pomegranate, possess anti-inflammatory properties through PPAR-ÃÂ³ activation. Here, we review the main synthetic and nutritional PPAR-ÃÂ³ ligands, proposing a dual approach based on the strengthening of the immune system using pharmacological and dietary strategies as an attempt to prevent/treat cytokine storm in the case of coronavirus infection.","Ciavarella, Carmen; Motta, Ilenia; Valente, Sabrina; Pasquinelli, Gianandrea",Molecules (Basel),812,24

Most patients present with an antecedent illness, most commonly upper respiratory tract infection, before the onset of progressive motor weakness. Several microorganisms have been associated with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome, most notably Campylobacter jejuni, Zika virus, and in 2020, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In C jejuni-related Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome, there is good evidence to support an autoantibody-mediated immune process that is triggered by molecular mimicry between structural components of peripheral nerves and the microorganism. Making a diagnosis of so-called classical Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome is straightforward; however, the existing diagnostic criteria have limitations and can result in some variants of the syndrome being missed. Most patients with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome do well with immunotherapy, but a substantial proportion are left with disability, and death can occur. Results from the International Guillain-BarrÃ© Syndrome Outcome Study suggest that geographical variations exist in Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome, including insufficient access to immunotherapy in low-income countries. There is a need to provide improved access to treatment for all patients with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome, and to develop effective disease-modifying therapies that can limit the extent of nerve injury. Clinical trials are currently underway to investigate some of the potential therapeutic candidates, including complement inhibitors, which, together with emerging data from large international collaborative studies on the syndrome, will contribute substantially to understanding the many facets of this disease.","Shahrizaila, Nortina; Lehmann, Helmar C; Kuwabara, Satoshi",Lancet,812,1

We evaluated the Hecin Scientific SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test kit, a dual-target real-time RT-PCR assay targeting the SARS-CoV-2 N and ORF1ab genes. METHODS: The Hecin test kit's diagnostic performance in detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA was compared to the LightMix Modular SARS and Wuhan CoV E-gene kit (TIB Molbiol) and an in-house single-tube nested real-time RT-PCR using 296 clinical specimens, 11 proficiency testing samples, and 30 low-positive deep throat saliva and nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples pooled into negative samples in ratios of 1:5, 1:10, and 1:30. RESULTS: The limit-of-detection of the Hecin test kit was around 500 dC/mL for the N and ORF1ab targets. Sensitivity and specificity of the Hecin test kit were 98.1% (95% CI: 93.4-99.8%) and 100% (98.1-100%), respectively, when measured against the reference method. The Hecin test kit showed fair sensitivity (80%) in low-positive NPS samples pooled in ratios of 1:5 and 1:10. Its performance in pooled samples could be dramatically improved by adjusting the assay Ct cutoff. CONCLUSION: The Hecin test kit enables sensitive and specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples and pooled samples.","Yip, Cyril C Y; Leung, Kit-Hang; Ng, Anthony C K; Chan, Kwok-Hung; To, Kelvin K W; Chan, Jasper F W; Hung, Ivan F N; Cheng, Vincent C C; Sridhar, Siddharth",Expert Rev Mol Diagn,812,1

These include the membrane-associated RING-CH (MARCH) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases that, among other functions, downregulate cell surface proteins involved in adaptive immunity. The RING-CH domain of MARCH proteins is thought to function by catalyzing the ubiquitination of the cytoplasmic tails (CTs) of target proteins, leading to their degradation. MARCH proteins have recently been reported to target retroviral envelope glycoproteins (Env) and vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G). However, the mechanism of antiviral activity remains poorly defined. Here we show that MARCH8 antagonizes the full-length forms of HIV-1 Env, VSV-G, Ebola virus glycoprotein (EboV-GP), and the spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), thereby impairing the infectivity of virions pseudotyped with these viral glycoproteins. This MARCH8-mediated targeting of viral glycoproteins requires the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the RING-CH domain. We observe that MARCH8 protein antagonism of VSV-G is CT dependent. In contrast, MARCH8-mediated targeting of HIV-1 Env, EboV-GP, and SARS-CoV-2 S protein by MARCH8 does not require the CT, suggesting a novel mechanism of MARCH-mediated antagonism of these viral glycoproteins. Confocal microscopy data demonstrate that MARCH8 traps the viral glycoproteins in an intracellular compartment. We observe that the endogenous expression of MARCH8 in several relevant human cell types is rapidly inducible by type I interferon. These results help to inform the mechanism by which MARCH proteins exert their antiviral activity and provide insights into the role of cellular inhibitory factors in antagonizing the biogenesis, trafficking, and virion incorporation of viral glycoproteins.IMPORTANCE Viral envelope glycoproteins are an important structural component on the surfaces of enveloped viruses that direct virus binding and entry and also serve as targets for the host adaptive immune response. In this study, we investigate the mechanism of action of the MARCH family of cellular proteins that disrupt the trafficking and virion incorporation of viral glycoproteins across several virus families. This research provides novel insights into how host cell factors antagonize viral replication, perhaps opening new avenues for therapeutic intervention in the replication of a diverse group of highly pathogenic enveloped viruses.","Lun, Cheng Man; Waheed, Abdul A; Majadly, Ahlam; Powell, Nicole; Freed, Eric O",mBio (Online),812,16

The main aim of this study was to evaluate the basic knowledge of educational and health care workers (HCWs) regarding COVID-19, its control, and prevention. Knowledge about origin, symptoms, and spread of viral infection was assessed. In this cross-sectional survey, a self-designed questionnaire was distributed among 302 HCWs including physicians (10.9%), nurses (1.32%), lab staff (1.65%), and academic individuals including faculty and students (86.42%) of different organizations. Results were analyzed using the &#967;2 test. Obtained results validate our null hypothesis that Pakistani masses are not well aware of the COVID-19 and strategies for the prevention and control of infection. The study concluded that individuals belonging to the front-line workers and high literacy groups are not prepared for the alarming situation in the country.

RECENT FINDINGS: There is ample evidence to support elevated Lp(a) levels, present in approximately 20% of the general population, as a causal, independent risk factor for CVD and its role as a significant risk enhancer. Several guidelines and position statements have been published to assist in the identification, treatment and follow-up of adults with elevated levels of Lp(a). There is growing interest in Lp(a) screening and strategies to improve health behaviors starting in youth, although published recommendations for this population are limited. In addition to the well established increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and valvular aortic stenosis, data from the coronavirus pandemic suggest adults with elevated Lp(a) may have a particularly high-risk of cardiovascular complications. Lp(a)-specific-lowering therapies are currently in development. Despite their inability to lower Lp(a), use of statins have been shown to improve outcomes in primary and secondary prevention. SUMMARY: Considerable differences exist amongst published guidelines for adults on the use of Lp(a) in clinical practice, and recommendations for youth are limited. With increasing knowledge of Lp(a)'s role in CVD, including recent observations of COVID-19-related risk of cardiovascular complications, more harmonized and comprehensive guidelines for Lp(a) in clinical practice are required. This will facilitate clinical decision-making and help define best practices for identification and management of elevated Lp(a) in adults and youth.","Wilson, Don P; Koschinsky, Marlys L; Moriarty, Patrick M",Curr Opin Endocrinol Diabetes Obes,812,2

The innate immunity of the infected patient is unable to mount an effective defense, resulting in a severe illness with substantial morbidity and mortality. As most treatment modalities including antivirals and anti-inflammatory agents are mostly ineffective, an immunological approach is needed. The mechanism of innate immunity to this viral illness is not fully understood. Passive immunity becomes an important avenue for the management of these patients. In this article, the immune responses of COVID-19 patients are reviewed. As SARS-CoV-2 has many characteristics in common with two other viruses, SARS-CoV that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the experiences learned from the use of passive immunity in treatment can be applied to COVID-19. The immune response includes the appearance of immunoglobulin M followed by immunoglobulin G and neutralizing antibodies. Convalescent plasma obtained from patients recovered from the illness with high titers of neutralizing antibodies was successful in treating many COVID-19 patients. The factors that determine responses as compared with those seen in SARS and MERS are also reviewed.

Exposure to an emerging pathogen generates an antibody response that can be used for preventing and treating the infection. These antibodies might have a high specificity to a target, few side effects, and are useful in the absence of an effective vaccine for treating immunocompromised individuals. The approved antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., regdanvimab, bamlanivimab, etesevimab, and casirivimab/imdevimab) have been selected from the antibody repertoire of B cells from convalescent patients using flow cytometry, next-generation sequencing, and phage display. This encourages use of these techniques especially phage display, because it does not require expensive types of equipment and can be performed on the lab bench, thereby making it suitable for labs with limited resources. Also, the antibodies in blood samples from convalescent patients can be used to screen pre-made peptide libraries to identify epitopes for vaccine development. Different types of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been developed, including inactivated virus vaccines, mRNA-based vaccines, non-replicating vector vaccines, and protein subunits. mRNA vaccines have numerous advantages over existing vaccines, such as efficacy, ease of manufacture, safety, and cost-effectiveness. Additionally, epitope vaccination may constitute an attractive strategy to induce high levels of antibodies against a pathogen and phages might be used as immunogenic carriers of such peptides. This is a point worth considering further, as phage-based vaccines have been shown to be safe in clinical trials and phages are easy to produce and tolerate high temperatures. In conclusion, identification of the antibody repertoire of recovering patients, and the epitopes they recognize, should be an attractive alternative option for developing therapeutic and prophylactic antibodies and vaccines against emerging pathogens.","Palma, Marco",Germs,812,30

Although behavioral immune system activation may be functional by helping people avoid such situations, experiencing these automatic reactions during sexual interactions may undermine people's evaluations of those interactions because sex requires close physical contact. We examined whether two sources of behavioral immune system activation (daily concern over contracting COVID-19 and individual differences in infection concern) undermined satisfaction with sex among 318 partnered adults in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants reported individual differences in perceived infectability and then, every night for two weeks, reported their (a) daily concern about contracting COVID-19, (b) daily stress, (c) whether they had sex with their partner, and (d) their satisfaction with sex when it occurred. People's perceived infectability moderated the association between their daily concern about contracting COVID-19 and the extent to which they enjoyed sex when it occurred, such that people higher, but not lower, in perceived infectability enjoyed sex less on days that they were more worried about contracting COVID-19 than usual. This effect was not moderated by biological sex and remained significant when controlling for biological sex, age, relationship length, and frequency of sex.

Recently, it has been postulated as a metabolic hormone. Further, moderately higher levels of bilirubin are positively associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity. However, due to poor solubility the therapeutic delivery of bilirubin remains a challenge. Nanotechnology offers unique advantages which may be exploited for improved delivery of bilirubin to the target organ with reduced risk of systemic toxicity. Herein, we postulate the use of intravenous administration or inhalational delivery of bilirubin nanomedicine (BNM) to combat systemic dysfunctions associated with COVID-19, owing to the remarkable preclinical efficacy and optimistic results of various clinical studies of bilirubin in non-communicable disorders. BNM may be used to harness the proven preclinical pharmacological efficacy of bilirubin against COVID-19 related systemic complications.","Khurana, Isha; Allawadhi, Prince; Khurana, Amit; Srivastava, Amit Kumar; Navik, Umashanker; Banothu, Anil Kumar; Bharani, Kala Kumar",Med Hypotheses,812,1

Its etiology is multifactorial but related to the overproduction of inflammatory and oxidative mediators. There is currently no cure for this disease, and drugs used to manage it often have deleterious side effects. H(2) is recognized as having anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, which may qualify it as a novel therapeutic for colitis. We induced an acute model of colitis in mice by administering dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for seven days. Mice were divided into five groups (n=6); normal, colitis, H(2)-treated colitis, sulfasalazine-treated colitis, and H(2) plus sulfasalazine-treated colitis. From days three to ten, mice were given H(2), sulfasalazine, or both. H(2) was administered via dissolving a hydrogen-generating tablet in water to make hydrogen-rich water (HRW), which was ingested ad libitum and via oral gavage (200 Î¼L). The Disease Activity Index (DAI), histological changes, and markers of inflammation and oxidative stress were assessed. HRW and sulfasalazine significantly improved bodyweight, DAI, mucosal damage, crypt loss, and spleen weight compared to control. Both treatments significantly decreased inflammation (high-sensitive C-reactive protein) and restored redox balance (total thiol, superoxide dismutase, catalase activity). There was a trend for the combination treatment to be more effective than either HRW or sulfasalazine alone. Furthermore, HRW tended to be as effective as, and often more effective than, sulfasalazine. HRW may serve as a therapeutic for ameliorating DSS-induced colitis in mice.","LeBaron, Tyler W.; Asgharzadeh, Fereshteh; Khazei, Majid; Kura, Branislav; Tarnava, Alex; Slezak, Jan",EXCLI J,812,17

Presented intermediate results evaluate the first infection period until the end of September 2020. METHODS: The study âCOVID-19: Hotspot hospital?- Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in hospital employees in a secondary care hospital network in Germany "" is a prospective, single centre observational cohort study conducted at the St. Vincenz Hospital Datteln with 316 beds. The presented data include one other hospital: St. Laurentius Stift Waltrop, Germany with 172 beds. RESULTS: Between June 2020 and September 2020 we analyzed serum samples of 907 employees which represents 62.1% of all employees. Thirteen employees (1.4%), respectively 13/696 healthcare workers (HCWs) (1.9%) had detectable SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Among them, 4 (30.8%) were aware of COVID-19 exposure, and 5 (38.5%) reported clinical symptoms. HCWs working in high-risk areas had a seroprevalence rate of 1.6% (1/64), HCWs working in intermediate-risk area 1.7% (11/632) and 0.5% employees (1/211) in low-risk areas with no contact to patients were seropositive. CONCLUSION: Even if we treated COVID-19 positive patients, we found no clear evidence that infection was transmitted to HCWs in contact to these patients. As knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 transmission evolves, the concept of infection prevention must be continuously reviewed and adapted as needed to keep hospitals a safe place.","Hildebrandt, Anke; HÃ¶kelekli, Oktay; Uflacker, Lutz; Rudolf, Henrik; Gatermann, SÃ¶ren G.",Int J Hyg Environ Health,812,1

Modern surveillance systems must meet the challenges of a dynamic emergence of infectious diseases and the factors that influence it, including human demographics and behavior, technology, economic development and land use, international travel and commerce, microbial adaptation and change, breakdown of public health measures, and potential acts of bioterrorism. Globally, the use of public health surveillance systems to track occurrences of infectious diseases and other public health threats has never been more important, and all countries have agreed to commit to conduct surveillance under the World Health Organization International Health Regulations (2005). Modern information technology can facilitate linking diverse sources of data, rapid analysis and synthesis of large amounts of information, and development of the communications and networks needed globally for surveillance and response to infectious diseases. Continued development of diagnostic and molecular laboratory methods, when effectively combined with epidemiologic information, can make prevention, recognition, and response to outbreaks faster and more effective.","Morgan, O.W.; Pinner, R.W.",Encyclopedia of Microbiology,812,32
