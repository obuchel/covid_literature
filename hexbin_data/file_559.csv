8825,Viral genetics,2005-08-04,"Certain enveloped viruses are known to assemble on membranes of the Golgi complex. Intracellular budding is facilitated by targeting of the viral glycoproteins to this organelle. It is likely that these viral glycoproteins are retained in the Golgi by the same means as are endogenous Golgi proteins. Consequently, the study of Golgi-specific viral proteins has provided important clues to the nature of Golgi retention signals.","Hobman, Tom C.",Trends Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133355/,559

17799,Enzyme Immobilization on Gold Nanoparticles for Electrochemical Glucose Biosensors,2021-04-28,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS), through the implementation of metagenomic protocols, has led to the discovery of thousands of new viruses in the last decade. Nevertheless, these protocols are still laborious and costly to implement, and the technique has not yet become routine for everyday virus characterization. Within the context of CRESS DNA virus studies, we implemented two alternative long-read NGS protocols, one that is agnostic to the sequence (without a priori knowledge of the viral genome) and the other that use specific primers to target a virus (with a priori). Agnostic and specific long read NGS-based assembled genomes of two capulavirus strains were compared to those obtained using the gold standard technique of Sanger sequencing. Both protocols allowed the detection and accurate full genome characterization of both strains. Globally, the assembled genomes were very similar (99.5–99.7% identity) to the Sanger sequences consensus, but differences in the homopolymeric tracks of these sequences indicated a specific lack of accuracy of the long reads NGS approach that has yet to be improved. Nevertheless, the use of the bench-top sequencer has proven to be a credible alternative in the context of CRESS DNA virus study and could offer a new range of applications not previously accessible.","Ben Chehida, Selim; Filloux, Denis; Fernandez, Emmanuel; Moubset, Oumaima; Hoareau, Murielle; Julian, Charlotte; Blondin, Laurence; Lett, Jean-Michel; Roumagnac, Philippe; Lefeuvre, Pierre",Microorganisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8147096/,559

23985,Migration in Saudi Arabia: Present and Prospects,2019-10-11,"Thymus transplantation was first attempted in the 1960s and 1970s using fetal thymus tissue [1, 2]. The results overall were disappointing [3–6]. In part the poor outcomes related to the lack of reagents needed to characterize and identify the patients into those who were truly athymic (complete DiGeorge anomaly) and those who had bone marrow stem cell problems (severe combined immunodeficiency). It is also possible that the fetal thymus tissue was too small to reconstitute a human infant [7]. The use of fetal thymus carried the risk of fatal graft versus host disease since mature T-cells can be found in the human thymus by the end of the first trimester [3]. By 1986, in a review of 26 infants treated with fetal thymus transplantation, 22 had died; the other 4 patients had achieved a 3-year survival [6].","Markert, M.

It performs various biological functions, such as recruiting inflammatory cells, wound healing, inhibition of stem cells, and maintaining effector immune response. It activates bone resorption cells and directly induces bone destruction. Cells that secrete MIP-1α/CCL3 are increased at sites of inflammation and bone resorption. MIP-1α/CCL3 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases and conditions that exhibit bone resorption, such as periodontitis, multiple myeloma, Sjögren syndrome, and rheumatoid arthritis. Biological fluids from patients with these diseases exhibit elevated levels of MIP-1α/CCL3. This finding indicates that MIP-1[Formula: see text] /CCL3 protein may have diagnostic potential for the detection of several inflammatory diseases and conditions. This chapter discusses the biological functions of MIP-1α/CCL3; describes several diseases associated with MIP-1α/CCL3, particularly periodontitis; and delineates the potential application of MIP-1α/CCL3 as a biomarker.","Bhavsar, Ishita; Miller, Craig S.; Al-Sabbagh, Mohanad",General Methods in Biomarker Research and their Applications,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7124056/,559

The present article is an abridged translation of that German guideline. MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS: (a) Neurosyphilis can manifest as early neurosyphilis (meningitis, meningovascular neurosyphilis or syphilitic gummas) or late neurosyphilis (tabes dorsalis, general paresis). (b) The following diagnostic criteria help to establish the presence of probable neurosyphilis (always point iv, accompanied by any two of points i to iii): (i) subacute or chronic neuro-psychiatric symptoms; (ii) increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell count or signs of blood–CSF barrier disruption; (iii) positive effect of anti-neurosyphilis antibiotic therapy on clinical course and CSF findings; (iv) positive TPHA/TPPA or FTA test in serum. (c) The diagnosis of neurosyphilis is confirmed by the subsequent detection of intrathecal production of antibodies against Treponema pallidum. (d) In neurosyphilis, treatment with intravenous penicillin or ceftriaxone for 14 days is recommended. (e) The following parameters can be used to assess a therapeutic effect: clinical findings, serum VDRL, and CSF cell count. CONCLUSION: The German guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of neurosyphilis is a practical tool to support clinicians in diagnosing and treating patients with neurosyphilis. This article is an abridged translation of this guideline (Klein MW, J.; Angstwurm, K.; Esser, S.; Hahn, K.; Matschke, M.; Scheithauer, S.; Schoefer, H.; Sturzenegger, M.; Wildemann, B.

56569,Refugees’ Transnational Livelihoods and Remittances: Syrian Mobilities in the Middle East Before and After 2011,2021-07-19,"The Indian food processing sector (IFPS) has a tremendous capability for growth that can improve the socio-economic conditions of the rural masses. The performance of this sector is lagging behind substantially when compared to other developing nations. This study aims to identify growth barriers at different supply chain (SC) stages in the IFPS. Delphi analysis is performed to find out the barriers in the IFPS. Eighteen growth barriers have been found through expert opinion and extensive literature review spanning across three supply chain tiers: farm level, distribution level, and the consumer level. Further, to prioritize and identify the relative importance of various barriers, the analytic hierarchy process is employed. The results show that the top growth barriers in IFPS are—the lack of standardization and quality in the processed food, rain-dependent farming, and the high cost of cold chain facilities. The novel contribution of this study lies in capturing the intricacies of growth barriers in IFPS in an integrated manner across different SC tiers. Interactions between the identified drivers are important to both practitioners and researchers in understanding and driving process, quality, and technology improvements. Finally, the results also throw light on prioritized areas of concern that can be a game-changer for policymakers in India and other developing nations.","Singh, Gaurvendra; Daultani, Yash; Sahu, Rajendra",OPSEARCH,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8336664/,559
60432,The sample of choice for detecting Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in asymptomatic dromedary camels using real-time reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction.,2016,"Background As pregnancy accelerates glioma growth, therapeutic abortion has been recommended prior to tumor resection. Additionally, it has also been suggested that the extent of glioma resection is closely correlated with patient survival. Case presentation A 162-cm, 61.4-kg, 30-year-old, right-handed primigravida was referred to our institution at 21 weeks gestation to obtain a second opinion. At 18 weeks gestation, the patient developed new-onset generalized convulsive seizures (GCSs), which were poorly controlled by anticonvulsant polytherapy, early in the second trimester. A 6-cm lesion located in her left frontal supplementary motor area (SMA) was suspected as a grade III glioma, classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Due to the limited evidence on the use of adjuvant therapy during pregnancy, tumors causing neurological symptoms and seizures must be treated, in order to stabilize the maternal condition and enable a safe birth. In the case of pregnant patients, awake craniotomy using intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) is considered advantageous, achieving gross total resection with a reduction of direct cortical stimulation, which may induce seizure, and so reducing fetal exposure to anesthetics. The ""Asleep-Awake-Asleep"" technique was performed at 27 weeks and 2 days gestation. As use of propofol in pregnant patients is prohibited, general anesthesia was maintained through administration of sevoflurane and remifentanil until the first scan of iMRI, and was subsequently re-induced with dexmedetomidine when tumor removal had been accomplished. A supraglottic airway (SGA) was used until the patient's cranium was opened. There were no complications during either the procedure or the post-operative period. At 35 weeks gestation, the patient delivered a healthy baby of 2317 g. Pathological examination of the patient, revealed an anaplastic astrocytoma, thus radiotherapy and chemotherapy began 2 months post-delivery. There is no evidence of tumor recurrence in the patient and the child did not show any medical or developmental concerns at the point of the 17-month follow-up. Conclusions Since evidence on the use of adjuvant therapy during pregnancy is limited, extensive resection with functional monitoring is recommended if a brain tumor is presumed to be malignant. Awake craniotomy is considered advantageous to pregnant patients because subjective movement preserves the patient's motor function and reduces fetal exposure to anesthetics. Therefore, providing multidisciplinary discussion takes place within the decision-making process, as well as careful perioperative preparation, awake craniotomy should be considered, even in the case of pregnant patients.","Kamata, Kotoe; Fukushima, Risa; Nomura, Minoru; Ozaki, Makoto",JA clinical reports,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40981-017-0090-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29457062/,559
75634,An overview of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus vaccines in preclinical studies.,2020-08-26,"Thrombosis is an adverse physiological event wherein the resulting thrombus and thrombus-induced diseases collectively result in high morbidity and mortality rates. Currently, nano-medicines that incorporate fluorophores emitting in the near-infrared-I (NIR-I, 700-900 nm) spectral region into their systems have been adopted to afford thrombosis theranostics. However, several unsolved problems such as limited penetration depth and image quality severely impede further applications of such nano-medicine systems. Fortunately, the ability to incorporate fluorophores emitting in the NIR-II (1000-1700 nm) window into nano-medicine systems can unambiguously identify biological processes with high signal-to-noise, deep tissue penetration depth, and high image resolution. Considering the inherently favorable properties of NIR-II fluorophores, we believe such have enormous potential to quickly become incorporated into nano-medicine systems for thrombosis theranostics. In this review, we i) discuss the development of NIR fluorescence as an imaging modality and fluorescent agents; ii) comprehensively summarize the recent development of NIR-I fluorophore-based nano-medicine systems for thrombosis theranostics; iii) highlight the state-of-the-art NIR-II fluorophores that have been designed for the specific purpose of affording thrombotic diagnosis; iv) speculate on possible forward avenues for the use of NIR-II fluorophores towards thrombosis diagnosis and therapy; and v) discuss the potential for their clinical translation.","Sun, Bin; Hettie, Kenneth S; Zhu, Shoujun",Advanced therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1002/adtp.202000278; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33997270/,559

Furthermore, Twitter is a tool allowing us to understand the focus of people regarding a topic of interest. OBJECTIVE To provide health policy-makers with insights concerning key topics of interest in the Twitter community regarding Covid-19, and to support information search and health communication. METHOD A total of 28.5M tweets have been retrieved, of which 6.9M tweets included hashtags. The data was analyzed using data science and natural language processing libraries. Qualitative analysis was performed using thematic analysis. RESULTS 907k different hashtags were used. Of these, only 1192 hashtags were used more than 1000 times. The qualitative analysis resulted in 13 themes. The top three themes regarding the number of hashtags used were related to Covid-19, identifying information, interventions, and geographical tagging. We explored the relationship between themes and showed how health practitioners can understand the communication in relation to specific topics expressed as hashtags (e.g., #stayhome).

85832,Recovery from the Middle East respiratory syndrome is associated with antibody and T-cell responses.,2017,"Limited success achieved in translating basic science discoveries into clinical applications for chronic airway diseases is attributed to differences in respiratory anatomy and physiology, poor approximation of pathologic processes, and lack of correlative clinical endpoints between humans and laboratory animal models. Here, we discuss advantages of using ferrets (Mustela putorus furo) as a model for improved understanding of human airway physiology and demonstrate assays for quantifying airway epithelial ion transport in vivo and ex vivo, and establish air-liquid interface cultures of ferret airway epithelial cells as a complementary in vitro model for mechanistic studies. We present data here that establishes the feasibility of measuring these human disease endpoints in ferrets. Briefly, potential difference across the nasal and the lower airway epithelium in ferrets could be consistently assessed, were highly reproducible, and responsive to experimental interventions. Additionally, ferret airway epithelial cells were amenable to primary cell culture methods for in vitro experiments as was the use of ferret tracheal explants as an ex vivo system for assessing ion transport. The feasibility of conducting multiple assessments of disease outcomes supports the adoption of ferrets as a highly relevant model for research in obstructive airway diseases.","Kaza, Niroop; Raju, S Vamsee; Cadillac, Joan M; Trombley, John A; Rasmussen, Lawrence; Tang, Liping; Dohm, Erik; Harrod, Kevin S; Rowe, Steven M",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0186984; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29077751/,559

96056,Progress toward a vaccine for Middle-Eastern respiratory syndrome.,2014,"Background Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common and serious complication in premature infants. Lung fibroblasts (LFs) are present in the extracellular matrix and participate in pulmonary development in response to BPD. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) on LFs cultured from newborn rats. Material and Methods. Primary LFs were isolated and treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF, 20 ng/mL) in the presence or absence of an ERK inhibitor, PD98059 (10 μmol/L). Phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) protein levels were determined using immunocytochemistry, western blotting, and real-time reverse transcription quantitative (RT-q)PCR. LF proliferation was examined by flow cytometry and a cell counting kit-8 assay. LF transdifferentiation was examined by protein and mRNA expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) by immunocytochemistry, western blotting, and RT-qPCR. LF migration was examined by the transwell method. Results Phosphorylated ERK1/2, which was activated by EGF, promoted LF proliferation by accelerating cell-cycle progression from the G1 to S phase. After treatment with PD98059, the expression of p-ERK1/2 in LFs, cellular proliferation, and the percentage of cells in S phase were significantly decreased. Phosphorylated ERK1/2 also promoted the differentiation of LFs into myofibroblasts through increased α-SMA synthesis and migration. Conclusion The activation of ERK promotes proliferation, transdifferentiation, and migration of lung fibroblasts from newborn rats.","Hu, Yu; Fu, JianHua; Liu, XueYan; Xue, XinDong",BioMed research international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/7176169; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33083482/,559

METHODS Changes in baseline characteristics, use of baseline CT angiography, treatment times and specifics, and outcomes were compared between the first 4 protocols and the fifth and final protocol. RESULTS Compared with subjects treated in the first 4 protocol versions (n=610), subjects treated in fifth and final protocol (n=46) were older (75 versus 68 years, P<0.0002) and less likely to have a pretreatment Rankin of 0 (76% versus 89%, P=0.01), were more likely to have a pretreatment CT angiography (65% versus 45%, P=0.009), had quicker median times in the endovascular arm from onset to start of intra-arterial therapy (209 versus 250 minutes, P=0.002) and to reperfusion (269 versus 344 minutes, P<0.0001), had a higher mean dose of total tissue-type plasminogen activator in the endovascular arm (74.0 versus 63.7 mg, P<0.0001), and were less likely to receive intra-arterial tissue-type plasminogen activator as part of the endovascular procedure (16% versus 44%, P=0.015). There were no significant differences in functional and safety outcomes between subjects treated in the 2 treatments arms in either the first 4 protocols or fifth protocol although the small sample size in the fifth protocol provided limited power.

103696,Epidemiological and Clinical Characteristics of Patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus in Iran in 2014.,2017,"Transcription and RNA decay are key determinants of gene expression; these processes are typically considered as the uncoupled beginning and end of the messenger RNA (mRNA) lifecycle. Here we describe the growing number of studies demonstrating interplay between these spatially disparate processes in eukaryotes. Specifically, cells can maintain mRNA levels by buffering against changes in mRNA stability or transcription, and can also respond to virally induced accelerated decay by reducing RNA polymerase II gene expression. In addition to these global responses, there is also evidence that mRNAs containing a premature stop codon can cause transcriptional upregulation of homologous genes in a targeted fashion. In each of these systems, RNA binding proteins (RBPs), particularly those involved in mRNA degradation, are critical for cytoplasmic to nuclear communication. Although their specific mechanistic contributions are yet to be fully elucidated, differential trafficking of RBPs between subcellular compartments are likely to play a central role in regulating this gene expression feedback pathway.","Hartenian, Ella; Glaunsinger, Britt A",Critical reviews in biochemistry and molecular biology,https://doi.org/10.1080/10409238.2019.1679083; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656086/,559

Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) potentially takes this further. Following the first human urological LESS report in 2007, numerous case series have emerged, as well as comparative studies comparing LESS with standard laparoscopy. However, comparative series between conventional laparoscopy and LESS for different procedures suggest a non-inferiority of LESS over standard laparoscopy, but the only objective benefit remains an improved cosmetic outcome. Challenging ergonomics, instrument clashing, lack of true triangulation, and in-line vision are the main concerns with LESS surgery. Various new instruments have been designed, but only experienced laparoscopists and well-selected patients are pivotal for a successful LESS procedure. Robotic-assisted LESS procedures have been performed.

130381,Entry from the cell surface of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus with cleaved S protein as revealed by pseudotype virus bearing cleaved S protein.,2008,"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is an abundant cofactor that plays crucial roles in several cellular processes. NAD can be synthesized de novo starting with tryptophan, or from salvage pathways starting with NAD precursors like nicotinic acid (NA), nicotinamide (NAM), or nicotinamide riboside (NR), referred to as niacin/B3 vitamins, arising from dietary supply or from cellular NAD catabolism. Given the interconversion between its oxidized (NAD+ ) and reduced form (NADH), NAD participates in a wide range of reactions: regulation of cellular redox status, energy metabolism, and mitochondrial biogenesis. Plus, NAD acts as a signaling molecule, being a co-substrate for several enzymes such as sirtuins, poly-ADP-ribose-polymerases (PARPs), and some ectoenzymes like CD38, regulating critical biological processes like gene expression, DNA repair, calcium signaling, and circadian rhythms. Given the large number of mitochondria present in cardiac tissue, the heart has the highest NAD levels and is one of the most metabolically demanding organs. In several models of heart failure, myocardial NAD levels are depressed and this depression is caused by mitochondrial dysfunction, metabolic remodeling, and inflammation. Emerging evidence suggests that regulating NAD homeostasis by NAD precursor supplementation has therapeutic efficiency in improving myocardial bioenergetics and function. This review provides an overview of the latest understanding of the different NAD biosynthesis pathways, as well as its role as a signaling molecule particularly in cardiac tissue. We highlight the significance of preserving NAD equilibrium in various models of heart disease and shed light on the potential pharmacological interventions aiming to use NAD boosters as therapeutic agents.","Tannous, Cynthia; Booz, George W; Altara, Raffaele; Muhieddine, Dina H; Mericksay, Mathias; Refaat, Marwan; Zouein, Fouad A",Acta physiologica,https://doi.org/10.1111/apha.13551; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32853469/,559

145982,Reader Response: Acute Hypokinetic-Rigid Syndrome After SARS-CoV-2 Infection.,2021-03-02,"PURPOSE Radiolabelled peptides used for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy are excreted mainly via the kidneys and are partly reabsorbed and retained in the proximal tubular cells. The resulting high renal radiation dose can cause nephrotoxicity, limiting the maximum activity dose and the effectiveness of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy. The mechanisms of kidney reabsorption of these peptides are incompletely understood, but the scavenger receptor megalin has been shown to play a role in the reabsorption of (111)In-octreotide. In this study, the role of megalin in the renal reabsorption of various relevant radiolabelled peptides was investigated. METHODS Groups of kidney-specific megalin-deficient mice and wild-type mice were injected with (111)In-labelled somatostatin, exendin, neurotensin or minigastrin analogues. Single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) images of the kidneys were acquired and analysed quantitatively, or the animals were killed 3 h after injection and the activity concentration in the kidneys was measured. RESULTS Megalin-deficient mice showed significantly lower uptake of all studied radiolabelled peptides in the kidneys, ranging from 22% ((111)In-octreotide) to 65% ((111)In-exendin) of uptake in wild-type kidneys. Quantitative analysis of renal uptake by SPECT and ex vivo measurements showed a very good correlation. CONCLUSION Megalin is involved in the renal reabsorption of radiolabelled octreotide, octreotate, exendin, neurotensin and minigastrin. This knowledge may help in the design of strategies to reduce this reabsorption and the resulting nephrotoxicity in peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, enabling more effective therapy. Small-animal SPECT is an accurate tool, allowing in vivo quantification of renal uptake and serial measurements in individual mice.","Vegt, Erik; Melis, Marleen; Eek, Annemarie; de Visser, Monique; Brom, Maarten; Oyen, Wim J G; Gotthardt, Martin; de Jong, Marion; Boerman, Otto C",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-010-1685-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21170526/,559
146638,Clinical and Laboratory Findings of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection.,2019,"As Jacobson v. Massachusetts recognized in 1905, the basis of public health law, and its ability to limit constitutional rights, is the use of scientific data and empirical evidence. Far too often, this important fact is lost. Fear, misinformation, and politics frequently take center stage and drive the implementation of public health law. In the recent Ebola scare, political leaders passed unnecessary and unconstitutional quarantine measures that defied scientific understanding of the disease and caused many to have their rights needlessly constrained. Looking at HIV criminalization and exemptions to childhood vaccine requirements, it becomes clear that the blame cannot be placed on the hysteria that accompanies emergencies. Indeed, these examples merely illustrate an unfortunate array of examples where empirical evidence is ignored in the hopes of quelling paranoia. These policy approaches are not only constitutionally questionable, they generate their own risk to public health. The ability of the law to jeopardize public health approaches to infectious disease control can, and should, be limited through a renewed emphasis on science as the foundation of public health, coordination through all levels and branches of government, and through a serious commitment by the judiciary to provide oversight. Infectious disease creates public anxiety, but this cannot justify unwarranted dogmatic approaches as a response. If we as a society hope to ensure efficient, constitutional control over the spread of disease, it is imperative that science take its rightful place at the forefront of governmental decision-making and judicial review. Otherwise, the law becomes its own public health threat.","Ulrich, Michael R",American journal of law & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0098858816658270; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29086645/,559

149389,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection: chest CT findings.,2014,"Indium selenide (InSe) has become a research hotspot because of its favourable carrier mobility and thickness-tunable band gap, showing great application potential in high-performance optoelectronic devices. The trend of miniaturization in optoelectronics has forced the feature sizes of the electronic components to shrink accordingly. Therefore, atomically thin InSe crystals may play an important role in future optoelectronics. Given the instability and ultralow photoluminescent (PL) emission of mechanically exfoliated ultrathin InSe, synthesis of highly stable mono- and few-layer InSe nanosheets with high PL efficiency has become crucial. Herein, ultrathin InSe nanosheets were prepared via thermal annealing of electrochemically intercalated products from bulk InSe. The size and yield of the as-prepared nanosheets were up to ~160 μm and ~70%, respectively, and ~80% of the nanosheets were less than five layer. Impressively, the as-prepared nanosheets showed greatly enhanced stability and PL emission because of surface modification by carbon species. Efficient photoresponsivity of 2 A/W was achieved in the as-prepared nanosheets based devices. These nanosheets were further assembled into large-area thin films with photoresponsivity of 16 A/W and an average Hall mobility of about 5 cm2 V-1 s-1. Finally, one-dimensional (1D) InSe nanoscrolls with length up to 90 μm were constructed by solvent-assisted self-assembly of the exfoliated nanosheets.","Hao, Qiaoyan; Liu, Jidong; Wang, Gang; Chen, Jiewei; Gan, Haibo; Zhu, Jiaqi; Ke, Yuxuan; Chai, Yang; Lin, Junhao; Zhang, Wenjing",ACS nano,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.0c03556; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32809802/,559

Patient characteristics, surgical outcomes, survival time, and immunonutritional status were compared. RESULTS Mean blood loss was significantly lower in the LG group, although the operation time did not differ. There were no significant differences in the number of dissected lymph nodes, postoperative morbidity, mortality, total hospital stay, and the causes of death. The prognostic nutritional index and skeletal muscle index at 1 year were better maintained in the LG group than in the open gastrectomy group. The overall and relapse-free survivals did not differ.

152058,"Contact tracing the first Middle East respiratory syndrome case in the Philippines, February 2015.",2015,"BACKGROUND The purpose of this retrospective study was to identify an appropriate material that can be used as a covering for patients with a spontaneous pneumothorax (SP). A total of 279 patients were studied over a period of eight years. METHODS The patient characteristics, surgical details and perioperative outcomes were analyzed. We compared the clinicopathological characteristics between recurrent and non-recurrent cases, and examined the associations with the material used for covering the SP, such as polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets, a fibrinogen-based collagen fleece (TachoComb; TC) or regenerated oxidized cellulose mesh (ROCM). RESULTS The differences in the gender, smoking habits, lesion site, location, comorbidities, ipsilateral spontaneous pneumothorax (ISP), contralateral spontaneous pneumothorax (CSP) and surgery for ISP did not reach statistical significance between the patients treated with a covering of ROCM and those treated with PGA/TC, although the age of the patients was significantly different in these groups, with the ROCM group having younger patients (p = 0.024). The length of the operation was significantly shorter in the ROCM group (mean: 76.7 minutes) than in the PGA/TC cases (130.4 minutes, p = 0.015). Concerning the intraoperative factors, there were no significant differences with regard to the approach, buttress stapling, covering or surgeon. No postoperative recurrence was observed in this series. There were no significant differences in the perioperative outcomes. However, the drainage period was shorter in subjects who underwent covering with the ROCM (mean: 1.125 days) than with the PGA/TC (2.412 days, p = 0.030). Further, the hospital stay had a tendency to be shorter in subjects who underwent covering with ROCM than with PGA/TC. CONCLUSIONS ROCM might be superior to PGA/TC as a material for covering SP in terms of the length of the operation and the drainage period. ROCM might decrease the hospital stay and the postoperative recurrence. Prospective studies in a larger cohort of patients will be necessary to define the optimal surgical technique to suppress the recurrence of SP.","Uramoto, Hidetaka; Tanaka, Fumihiro",Journal of cardiothoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/1749-8090-9-74; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24775221/,559

There were 69.3% interventional studies, 21.7% observational studies, 5.3% diagnostic tests, and 3.7% other studies. The following statistics are provided only for the interventional studies. Severity of disease: 5.3% light and common type, 17.6% severe and critically ill, and 59.6% with no restricted classification. Medication use: 51.1% Western medicine, 32.1% Chinese medicine, 10.7% blood related product, and 6.1% non-drug therapy. The median and inner quantile range of the sample sizes included in these studies: 104 (IQR: 60, 200). Primary outcome type most used: 45.8% with clinical characteristics and 21.4% with virological. Study design characteristics: 71% of all studies were randomized, 5% of all studies were blinded, 18% of all studies were multicenter, and 76% of all studies were single-center.Conclusion: Although many COVID-19 studies include randomization in their design, the lack of additional double-blind and placebo-controlled elements in their designs result in a less robust evaluation of intervention safety and efficacy. Furthermore, similar or repeated research and small sample studies that have less promise in gains of new information have possibly led to a shortage of recruitable patients and become a barrier to the completion of large multicenter clinical trial studies.","Wang, Bin; Lai, Junkai; Yan, Xiaoyan; Jin, Feifei; Yao, Chen",Current medical research and opinion,https://doi.org/10.1080/03007995.2020.1771294; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32427000/,559

Production of ""dry wastes"" in Isfahan, with a population of more than 1.9 million, has increased during the pandemic. Personal protective equipments (PPEs) including face masks, single-use gloves and face shields are an emerging group of materials in Isfahan's waste stream. On average, Isfahanian residents have daily discarded over 1.49 and 2.98 million pieces of facemasks and plastic gloves, respectively, after the new Coronavirus pandemic. Overall production of hospital wastes in Isfahan slightly decreased during the pandemic. COVID-19 related wastes in hospitals are mainly treated by wet autoclave method, then collected and transferred to the Sejzy site to be landfilled. Waste separation, recycling and composting programs have been banned due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and all collected MSW are directly disposed of at Sejzy disposal site. Composting as the main disposal method for 60%-70% of the MSW in Isfahan has been terminated; therefore landfilling of urban wastes has dramatically escalated by 3.6 times. Appropriate urban waste management protocols must be provided to restart safe separation, recycling and composting programs to reduce pressure on land for disposal, while practicing safe waste management measures to minimize the possibility of the spread of the viral disease.","Zand, Ali Daryabeigi; Heir, Azar Vaezi",Environmental technology,https://doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2020.1866082; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33331802/,559

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective review of all maternal deaths from all health care facilities from April to September 2020 were conducted using COVID registers and maternity case records. Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of Witwatersrand approved the study. Data included total live births, maternal mortality ratio (MMR), age, ethnicity, place of admission, parity, pregnancy status, antenatal complications, gestational age (GA) at delivery, GA at COVID 19 diagnosis, GA at death, symptoms, comorbidity, investigations (HIV, platelets, lymphocytes and LDH), and fetal outcome. Descriptive statistics (mean ± standard deviation, number and percentages) were calculated. RESULTS Six women died from COVID. All were African. Mean age was 33.5 (SD ± 4.3) years majority (83%) were multiparous. The mean GA at the time of diagnosis was 35 (± 5.8) weeks. All had dyspnea at presentation. All had hypertension. HIV rate (50%) was higher than the national rate. High lactic dehydrogenase was the commonest laboratory abnormality. Rate of macerated stillborn (66%) was very high. CONCLUSION To date, there are no African studies reporting on maternal mortality from COVID 19. This study provided valuable insight into maternal deaths due to COVID among South African women. COVID 19 is a novel cause of maternal death that has increased the death rate among South African pregnant women. Hypertensive women are at increased risk of death. They should be routinely tested for COVID. Women are at risk of death during the third trimester of pregnancy. High rate of stillborn is a concern. Decision to deliver earlier should be an option. High HIV rate and LDH count should alert health care workers to perform these tests among all COVID positive mothers.","Basu, Jayati Kusari; Chauke, Lawrence; Magoro, Terrance","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2021.1902501; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33752563/,559

As a result, it was found in some cases a null level of accessibility and, in other cases, complexity was detected in the access to activities. As for no conformances with WCAG, two of the most prominent were empty links and the absence of headings for efficient screen reader navigation.

In the previous study, the detection of the cyanines was achieved by whole body optical imaging, a technique that, due to the limited penetration of near-infrared light, is not suitable for investigations deeper than 1 cm within the human body. Therefore, in order to facilitate clinical translation, the purpose of the present study was to generate a necrosis avid cyanine-based NIRF probe that could also be used for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). For this, the necrosis avid NIRF cyanine HQ4 was radiolabeled with 111indium, via the chelate diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA). PROCEDURES The necrosis avid properties of the radiotracer [111In]DTPA-HQ4 were examined in vitro and in vivo in different breast tumor models in mice using SPECT and optical imaging. Moreover, biodistribution studies were performed to examine the pharmacokinetics of the probe in vivo. RESULTS Using optical imaging and radioactivity measurements, in vitro, we showed selective accumulation of [111In]DTPA-HQ4 in dead cells. Using SPECT and in biodistribution studies, the necrosis avidity of the radiotracer was confirmed in a 4T1 mouse breast cancer model of spontaneous tumor necrosis and in a MCF-7 human breast cancer model of chemotherapy-induced tumor necrosis. CONCLUSIONS The radiotracer [111In]DTPA-HQ4 possessed strong and selective necrosis avidity in vitro and in various mouse models of tumor necrosis in vivo, indicating its potential to be clinically applied for diagnostic purposes and to monitor anti-cancer treatment efficacy.","Stammes, Marieke A; Knol-Blankevoort, Vicky T; Cruz, Luis J; Feitsma, Hans R I J; Mezzanotte, Laura; Cordfunke, Robert A; Sinisi, Riccardo; Dubikovskaya, Elena A; Maeda, Azusa; DaCosta, Ralph S; Bierau, Katja; Chan, Alan; Kaijzel, Eric L; Snoeks, Thomas J A; van Beek, Ermond R; Löwik, Clemens W G M",Molecular imaging and biology : MIB : the official publication of the Academy of Molecular Imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27277828/,559
190047,Congress calendar.,1978,"The role of nitric oxide (NO) in the pathogenesis of viral encephalitis was investigated by using an experimental model of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis in Lewis rats. The expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) mRNA determined by Northern blotting was observed first in the olfactory bulb and the brain stem on day 5 after intranasal inoculation of HSV-1, and thereafter iNOS mRNA was detected in other brain regions, i.e., cerebrum and cerebellum. In various parts of the brain, excessive NO production was identified by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. The temporal and spatial patterns of iNOS expression coincided with those of viral propagation, as demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction for HSV-1 gene expression as well as by the plaque-forming assay. Immunohistochemical study determined that iNOS was localized mainly in monocyte-derived macrophages. Treatment of virus-infected animals with the NOS inhibitor Nomega-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA), but not Nomega-monomethyl-d-arginine, significantly ameliorated not only clinical symptoms such as paralysis and seizures but also mortality. Virus yield from brain tissue was not affected by l-NMMA treatment. It is of interest that increased expression of the antioxidant enzyme heme oxygenase-1 was observed in the HSV-1-infected brain; this increased expression was strongly inhibited by l-NMMA treatment. These data suggest that the high level of NO produced by iNOS is a pathogenic factor in HSV-1-induced encephalitis in rats.","Fujii, S; Akaike, T; Maeda, H",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10191185/,559

198513,Recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara expressing the spike glycoprotein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus induces protective neutralizing antibodies primarily targeting the receptor binding region.,2005,"The traditional cornerstones of analgesic therapy for patients with acute pain have been oral therapies; however, all oral agents exhibit a variety of potentially dose-limiting or intolerable adverse effects in patients. Elderly patients and those with concomitant conditions already being managed with multiple systemic drugs may be particularly susceptible to systemic toxicities with oral analgesic therapies. Topical agents offer an alternative to oral modalities and can effectively treat patients with acute pain while offering lower systemic absorption and conferring little risk of systemic toxicity. The objective of this article is to review the therapeutic usefulness of available topical therapies in their most thoroughly investigated applications, the treatment of patients with acute musculoskeletal and herpetic pain. For example, although heating pads/wraps and cold packs are widely used to alleviate pain associated with sprains, strains, and contusions, evidence of the effectiveness of these methods is lacking. However, there are sufficient data supporting the use of various topical formulations of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for these indications (ketoprofen gel or patch, ibuprofen gel or cream, and diclofenac gel or patch), and demonstrating markedly less patient risk of systemic toxicity than is associated with oral NSAID therapy. A ketoprofen patch was shown to be effective and well tolerated in the treatment of patients with tendinopathies. In the treatment of acute neck or low back pain, cold and heat therapies have demonstrated limited effectiveness for patients, and the efficacy of topical NSAIDs has not been established. Use of topical NSAID therapy has been useful in reducing acute-phase herpes zoster pain, and the lidocaine 5% patch has been shown to reduce acute herpetic pain intensity once lesions have healed (the patch cannot be applied to open skin lesions). Topical analgesics represent an alternative treatment modality for patients experiencing acute pain who cannot or choose not to take oral therapies.","McCarberg, Bill; D'Arcy, Yvonne",Postgraduate medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24547600/,559
199977,"Analysis of Asymptomatic and Presymptomatic Transmission in SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak, Germany, 2020",2021,"BACKGROUND Internal carotid artery bifurcation aneurysms (ICAbifAs) present unique challenges to endovascular and surgical operators, and little is known about their natural history. We reviewed our institution's experience with ICAbifAs studying outcomes of surgical and endovascular management and natural history. METHODS Consecutive patients with unruptured ICAbifAs evaluated and/or treated over an 8-year interval were studied. Baseline demographics, neurovascular risk factors, aneurysm location and size, clinical presentation, treatment recommendations, and outcomes were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. Continuous variables were compared with Student's t test and categorical variables with Chi-square tests. RESULTS Fifty-nine patients with 61 unruptured ICAbifAs were included. Seven aneurysms were treated surgically (11.5 %), 22 underwent endovascular treatment (36 %), and 32 were managed conservatively (52.5 %). In the surgical group, short- and long-term complete aneurysm occlusion rates were 100 % with no cases of perioperative or long-term permanent morbidity or treatment-related mortality. In the endovascular group, two patients (11.7 %) with giant aneurysms had perioperative thromboembolic events with transient morbidity. There was one case of aneurysm rupture at follow-up in a giant aneurysm treated with partial coil embolization. Complete/near-complete occlusion rates were 63 %. There was one case of aneurysm rupture after 114 aneurysm-years of follow-up in the conservative management group (0.89 %/year), but no ruptures were observed in small aneurysms selected for conservative management. CONCLUSIONS Unruptured small ICAbifAs have a benign natural history. In patients selected for treatment, excellent results can be achieved in the vast majority of patients with judicious use of endovascular and surgical therapy.","La Pira, Biagia; Brinjikji, Waleed; Burrows, Anthony M; Cloft, Harry J; Vine, Roanna L; Lanzino, Giuseppe",Acta neurochirurgica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27644699/,559

Resident oncologists and their practices are equally affected. Objectives: The study examines resident oncologists' challenges, experiences and approaches in the delivery of care for oncological patients receiving palliative treatment and their relatives during the pandemic. Findings will support future pandemic preparedness for cancer treatment in outpatients. Materials and methods: Content analyses of 13 guideline-based telephone interviews with resident oncologists. Results: Solid local networks, staff and structural rearrangements and infection control within offices helped oncologists maintaining quality of care. Required treatments have been continued. The interrupted information flow towards patients' relatives and catching up on previously postponed primary, control or follow-up consultations have been reported as a challenge. Other issues have been linked to suspected SARS-CoV­2 infection in patients and staff. The lack of information, temporal inaccessibility of health care authorities and physicians' associations, and additional costs for infection control material caused further problems. Conclusions: Due to the firmly implemented infection control and the re-organisation of facilities and staff, oncologists have been able to maintain treatment and care for cancer patients and their relatives. Hygiene procedures proved to work well and might be re-activated. An increased use of digital applications for treatment monitoring might be considered. Furthermore, solutions to meet additional financial and personnel demands caused by infection control must be identified. The design of suitable concepts for the prevention of health-related hazards due to visiting bans for relatives and therapeutic staff such as physio- and occupational therapists is inevitable.","Weber, Jan P; Tielker, Jannik M; Kamandi, Nilab; Simon, Steffen T; Bausewein, Claudia; Stiel, Stephanie; Schneider, Nils",Onkologe (Berl),,559

This study explores potential interest in missed period pills in two US states. STUDY DESIGN: We enrolled people seeking pregnancy test services at nine health centers in two US states between June 2015 and October 2017. Participants completed an anonymous questionnaire containing closed- and open-ended questions about background characteristics, reproductive practices, pregnancy feelings and intentions, abortion attitudes, and MPP interest. We used ordered logistic regression to identify factors associated with MPP interest and inductive content analysis to identify recurring qualitative themes related to MPP interest or disinterest. RESULTS: In all, 678 people completed the survey and 286/678 (42%) indicated interest in missed period pills. Interest was greatest (129/185 or 70%) among those who would be unhappy if pregnant. Variables associated with interest in the multivariate analyses were age &#8805;35, nulliparity, prior abortion and contraceptive use, recent use of emergency contraception, pregnancy feelings and intentions, and abortion attitudes (p<.05). Variables not associated with interest included state of residence, educational attainment, ethnicity, religious affiliation, and frequency of religious attendance. Key reasons for interest were to prevent, avoid or terminate pregnancy; and psychological or emotional benefits, including management of abortion stigma. Reasons for non-interest included concerns about safety or side effects, desire to be pregnant or have a baby, and not wanting to abort or hurt the fetus/baby. CONCLUSION: If missed period pills were available in the United States, demand might be substantial and wide-ranging across demographic groups. IMPLICATIONS: Our findings suggest that some people with missed periods do not desire pregnancy confirmation before taking medications that might disrupt a pregnancy. As a result, provision of missed period pills in the United States would expand reproductive service options and could improve the delivery of patient-centered care.","Sheldon, Wendy R; Mary, Meighan; Harris, Lisa; Starr, Katherine; Winikoff, Beverly",Contraception,,559
246308,Amotosalen and ultraviolet A light treatment efficiently inactivates severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in human plasma,2020,"BACKGROUND: In response to the COVID-19 epidemic a few countries have rolled out widespread testing of the population, while in other countries only people requiring hospital admission are being screened. After an extensive testing strategy during the initial few weeks in the early phase of the epidemic, the Italian Ministry of Health made its testing policy more stringent. In this study we assess the contribution of the testing policy to containing the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in Northern Italy. METHODS: The analysis is focused on the evolution of the epidemic and related health intervention in four regions where approximately 80% of the national death toll due to COVID-19 has occurred.The assumed under-estimation of asymptomatic cases has led us to make use of the number of deaths due to the epidemic to analyse the effectiveness of testing. The analysis is conducted through an autoregressive time-series approach where we use official data from the Ministry of Health. RESULTS: The results of the analysis confirm a negative relationship between the number of tests carried out and the progression of the epidemic. In particular, results reveal that the tests are particularly effective in breaking the chain of transmission when they are implemented at the early stages of the spread of the virus. CONCLUSIONS: A large-scale testing policy is recommended as a critical contribution to effectively contain the epidemic. In addition, it is highly recommended to set up all necessary measures to enable the quick scale-up of testing capacity whenever required.","De Matteis, Alessandro; Turkmen Ceylan, Fethiye B; Adrianopoli, Marina; Ertek, Sibel",Eur. j. public health,,559

METHODS: COVID-19-infected patients admitted to the San Paolo University Hospital of Milan that underwent a clinically indicated echocardiographic examination were included in the study. To limit contamination, all measurements were performed offline. Quantitative measurements were obtained by an operator blinded to the clinical data. RESULTS: Among the 49 patients, nonsurvivors (33%) had worse respiratory parameters, index of multiorgan failure, and worse markers of lung involvement. Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction (as assessed by conventional and 2-dimensional speckle tracking) was a common finding and a powerful independent predictor of mortality. At the ROC curve analyses, RV free wall longitudinal strain (LS) showed an AUC 0.77 ± 0.08 in predicting death, P = .008, and global RV LS (RV-GLS) showed an AUC 0.79 ± 0.04, P = .004. This association remained significant after correction for age (OR = 1.16, 95%CI 1.01-1.34, P = .029 for RV free wall LS and OR = 1.20, 95%CI 1.01-1.42, P = .033 for RV-GLS), for oxygen partial pressure at arterial gas analysis/fraction of inspired oxygen (OR = 1.28, 95%CI 1.04-1.57, P = .021 for RV free wall-LS and OR = 1.30, 95%CI 1.04-1.62, P = .020 for RV-GLS) and for the severity of pulmonary involvement measured by a computed tomography lung score (OR = 1.27, 95%CI 1.02-1.19, P = .034 for RV free wall LS and OR = 1.30, 95%CI 1.04-1.63, P = .022 for RV-GLS). CONCLUSIONS: In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, offline quantitative 2D-echocardiographic assessment of cardiac function is feasible.

280449,Optimizing SARS-CoV-2 Surveillance in the United States: Insights From the National Football League Occupational Health Program,2021,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease caused more than 100,000,000 people get infected and over 2,200,000 people being killed worldwide. However, the current developed vaccines or drugs may be not effective in preventing the pandemic of COVID-19 due to the mutations of coronavirus and the severe side effects of the newly developed vaccines. Chinese herbal medicines and their active components play important antiviral activities. Corilagin exhibited antiviral effect on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). However, whether it blocks the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and hACE2 has not been elucidated. PURPOSE: To characterize an active compound, corilagin derived from Phyllanthus urinaria as potential SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors for its possible preventive application in daily anti-virus hygienic products. METHODS: Computational docking coupled with bio-layer interferometry, BLI were adopted to screen more than 1800 natural compounds for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 spike-RBD inhibitors. Corilagin was confirmed to have a strong binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2-RBD or human ACE2 (hACE2) protein by the BLI, ELISA and immunocytochemistry (ICC) assay. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of viral infection of corilagin was assessed by in vitro pseudovirus system. Finally, the toxicity of corilagin was examined by using MTT assay and maximal tolerated dose (MTD) studies in C57BL/6 mice. RESULTS: Corilagin preferentially binds to a pocket that contains residues Cys 336 to Phe 374 of spike-RBD with a relatively low binding energy of -9.4 kcal/mol. BLI assay further confirmed that corilagin exhibits a relatively strong binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2-RBD and hACE2 protein. In addition, corilagin dose-dependently blocks SARS-CoV-2-RBD binding and abolishes the infectious property of RBD-pseudotyped lentivirus in hACE2 overexpressing HEK293 cells, which mimicked the entry of SARS-CoV-2 virus in human host cells. Finally, in vivo studies revealed that up to 300 mg/kg/day of corilagin was safe in C57BL/6 mice. Our findings suggest that corilagin could be a safe and potential antiviral agent against the COVID-19 acting through the blockade of the fusion of SARS-CoV-2 spike-RBD to hACE2 receptors. CONCLUSION: Corilagin could be considered as a safe and environmental friendly anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent for its potential preventive application in daily anti-virus hygienic products.","Yang, Li Jun; Chen, Rui Hong; Hamdoun, Sami; Coghi, Paolo; Ng, Jerome P L; Zhang, David Wei; Guo, Xiaoling; Xia, Chenglai; Law, Betty Yuen Kwan; Wong, Vincent Kam Wai",Phytomedicine,,559

The main objective of our research was to identify the socio-demographic factors affecting the risk of FI in Poland within 2014-2019. Moreover, we aimed to examine the effects of the family-oriented social program ""Family 500+"" by comparing the situation in various types of households with children a few years before and after the program was launched. The analysis was based on the set of eight-item FI indicators adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization using the Gallup World Poll nationally representative survey data. Based on our results the most vulnerable groups in the context of FI were identified. We confirmed the importance of education, gender, age, marital status, household composition, status of employment and income in preventing FI. The effectiveness of the support program in reducing FI was demonstrated as households with at least three children experienced significant improvement in the FI status during the studied years. These findings should be especially important in the context of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on FI. As FI can affect the quality and quantity of food choices it is associated with a poorer health status, which increases the risk of infection, including COVID-19, and worsens recovery prognosis. Planning an efficient response to the pandemic requires a comprehension of the increased risk of exposure experienced by people, especially those who are food insecure.","Dudek, Hanna; Myszkowska-Ryciak, Joanna",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,559

METHODS: Remnant serum samples for routine bloodwork from 2,338 pediatric patients at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh were assessed using the EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG (EuroIGG) assay. Reactive cases with sufficient volume were also tested using 3 additional commercial assays. RESULTS: Eighty-five specimens were reactive according to the EuroIGG, yielding 3.64% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.91%-4.48%) seropositivity, of which 73 specimens had sufficient remaining volume for confirmation by orthogonal testing. Overall, 19.18% (95% CI, 10.18%-28.18%) of samples were positive on a second and/or third orthogonal assay. This 80.82% false positivity rate is disproportionate to the expected false positivity rate of 50% given our pediatric population prevalence and assay performance. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric populations, false-positive SARS-CoV-2 serology may be more common than assay and prevalence parameters would predict, and further studies are needed to establish the performance of SARS-CoV-2 serology in children.","Geisler, Daniel; Freeman, Megan Culler; Rapsinski, Glenn J; Wheeler, Sarah E",Am J Clin Pathol,,559

In this study we aimed to investigate the impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown period (March-May 2020) on snacking behavior, fast-food and alcohol consumption. A systematic search in PubMed®, Scopus® and Web of Science® databases was conducted and 32 studies were included. Changes in snacking, in fast-food and ordered food consumption and in alcohol intake were examined. Snacking was found to be increased for a significant portion of the population examined (18.9-45.1%), whereas fast food (15.0-41.3%) and ordered food (33.9%) showed a tendency towards decrease. As per alcohol consumption, an upward trend was observed in a significant part (10.4-51.0%) of the participants examined. The increased snacking and alcohol consumption observed for almost a third of the examined population could be alarming because long-term health problems could arise in cases of repeated lockdowns in the future. The observed downward trend in fast-food consumption and in frequency of ordered food could be an encouraging sign of turning to home-prepared foods, but further research is needed in this field.","Bakaloudi, Dimitra Rafailia; Jeyakumar, Dhanushya T; Jayawardena, Ranil; Chourdakis, Michail",Clin. nutr.

364308,The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in the breath of some infected dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius),2020,"13 years after the first Lancet Series on maternal and child undernutrition, we reviewed the progress achieved on the basis of global estimates and new analyses of 50 low-income and middle-income countries with national surveys from around 2000 and 2015. The prevalence of childhood stunting has fallen, and linear growth faltering in early life has become less pronounced over time, markedly in middle-income countries but less so in low-income countries. Stunting and wasting remain public health problems in low-income countries, where 4·7% of children are simultaneously affected by both, a condition associated with a 4·8-times increase in mortality. New evidence shows that stunting and wasting might already be present at birth, and that the incidence of both conditions peaks in the first 6 months of life. Global low birthweight prevalence declined slowly at about 1·0% a year. Knowledge has accumulated on the short-term and long-term consequences of child undernutrition and on its adverse effect on adult human capital. Existing data on vitamin A deficiency among children suggest persisting high prevalence in Africa and south Asia. Zinc deficiency affects close to half of all children in the few countries with data. New evidence on the causes of poor growth points towards subclinical inflammation and environmental enteric dysfunction. Among women of reproductive age, the prevalence of low body-mass index has been reduced by half in middle-income countries, but trends in short stature prevalence are less evident. Both conditions are associated with poor outcomes for mothers and their children, whereas data on gestational weight gain are scarce. Data on the micronutrient status of women are conspicuously scarce, which constitutes an unacceptable data gap. Prevalence of anaemia in women remains high and unabated in many countries. Social inequalities are evident for many forms of undernutrition in women and children, suggesting a key role for poverty and low education, and reinforcing the need for multisectoral actions to accelerate progress. Despite little progress in some areas, maternal and child undernutrition remains a major global health concern, particularly as improvements since 2000 might be offset by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Victora, Cesar G; Christian, Parul; Vidaletti, Luis Paulo; Gatica-Domínguez, Giovanna; Menon, Purnima; Black, Robert E",Lancet,,559

NMDARs are heterotetramers composed of GluN1 and GluN2 subunits, which bind glycine and glutamate, respectively, to activate their ion channels. Despite importance in brain physiology, the precise mechanisms by which activation and inhibition occur via subunit-specific binding of agonists and antagonists remain largely unknown. Here, we show the detailed patterns of conformational changes and inter-subunit and -domain reorientation leading to agonist-gating and subunit-dependent competitive inhibition by providing multiple structures in distinct ligand states at 4 Å or better. The structures reveal that activation and competitive inhibition by both GluN1 and GluN2 antagonists occur by controlling the tension of the linker between the ligand-binding domain and the transmembrane ion channel of the GluN2 subunit. Our results provide detailed mechanistic insights into NMDAR pharmacology, activation, and inhibition, which are fundamental to the brain physiology.","Chou, Tsung-Han; Tajima, Nami; Romero-Hernandez, Annabel; Furukawa, Hiro",Cell,,559

Increased loneliness and social isolation are associated with adverse health outcomes, yet there is a gap in brief interventions that specifically target loneliness. This article introduces a brief intervention to strengthen connectedness, LOVE. In a systematic way, this solution-focused approach encourages openness and sharing of current struggles with the existing circle of support. There are four steps in LOVE: List people in one's life, Organise them on the helpfulness-availability matrix, Verify what they know to map them onto circles of trust and Engage them through self-disclosure. CONCLUSION: The article details each concept, its importance, the pragmatics involved and top tips to guide practice. The memorable acronym provides logical sequence and structure. It is time efficient in training and delivery, with no former mental health knowledge required so there is potential for wide application. It facilitates collaboration between health professionals and people in distress and promotes empowerment and self-resilience. Adapted from the safety planning component of PROTECT, a pre-existing suicide prevention framework, LOVE has to be fine-tuned as a brief intervention in the wider context of the pandemic.","Kar Ray, Manaan; Chow, Ka Ki; Theodoros, Theo; Wyder, Marianne; Steginga, Anne; Sorrensen, Rosemary; Hickey, Paul; Lau, Geoff; Kinsella, Kieran; Lombardo, Chiara",Australas Psychiatry,,559

405396,When hospitals Harm: Multi-modal entry of SARS-CoV-2 into inpatient healthcare,2020,"An animal model that can mimic the SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans is critical to understanding the newly emerged, rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 and development of therapeutic strategies. Studies show that the spike (S) proteins of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-S-1-S) and SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2-S) bind to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2, a well-recognized, functional receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) to mediate viral entry. Several hACE2 transgenic (hACE2Tg) mouse models are being widely used, which is clearly invaluable. However, the hACE2Tg mouse model cannot fully explain: 1) low expression of ACE2 observed in human lung and heart, but lung or heart failure occurs frequently in severe COVID-19 patients);2) low expression of ACE2 on immune cells, but lymphocytopenia occurs frequently in COVID-19 patients;and 3) hACE2Tg mice do not develop strong clinical disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection in contrast to SARS-CoV-1. Moreover, one of most outstanding features of coronaviruses is the diversity of receptor usage, which includes the newly proposed human CD147 (hCD147) as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2-S. It is still debatable whether CD147 can serve as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection or entry. Here we successfully generated a hCD147Tg mouse model in the NOD- scid IL2Rgamma (null) (NSG) background. In this hCD147Tg-NSG mouse model, the hCD147 genetic sequence was placed following the endogenous mouse promoter for mouse CD147 (mCD147), which creates an in vivo model that may better recapitulate physiological expression of CD147 proteins at the molecular level compared to the existing and well-studied K18-hACE2-B6 model. In addition, the hCD147Tg-NSG mouse model allows further study of SARS-CoV-2 in the immunodeficiency condition which may assist our understanding of this virus in the context of high-risk populations with immunosuppressed conditions. The hCD147Tg-NSG mouse mode can serve as an additional animal model for interrogate whether CD147 serve as an independent functional receptor or accessory receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry and immune responses.","Badeti, S.; Tseng, H.

To deal with the severe crisis resulting from the pandemic, worldwide institutions have been forced to make decisions that profoundly affect the socio-economic realm. In this sense, researchers from diverse knowledge areas are investigating the behavior of the disease in a rush against time. In both cases, the lack of reliable data has been an obstacle to carry out such tasks with accuracy.

In particular, the pandemic expansion is analyzed with variables of health nature, but also social ones, mobility, etc. Besides, COnVIDa permits to smoothly join such data, compare and download them for further analysis. Due to the open-science nature of the project, COnVIDa is easily extensible to any other region of the planet.

We sought to determine the rate of seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies and of acute asymptomatic infection among firefighter first responders in a single county with early exposure in the pandemic. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of clinically active firefighters cross-trained as paramedics or EMTs in the fire departments of Santa Clara County, California. Firefighters without current symptoms were tested between June and August 2020. Our primary outcomes were rates of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody seropositivity and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR swab positivity for acute infection. We report cumulative incidence, participant characteristics with frequencies and proportions, and proportion positive and associated relative risk (with 95% confidence intervals). Results: We enrolled 983 out of 1339 eligible participants (response rate: 73.4%). Twenty-five participants (2.54%, 95% CI 1.65-3.73) tested positive for IgG antibodies and 9 (0.92%, 95% CI 0.42-1.73) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Our cumulative incidence, inclusive of self-reported prior positive PCR tests, was 34 (3.46%, 95% CI 2.41-4.80).

Recent research has analyzed any possible factors causing the COVID-19 spreads were climate factors and population density. Indonesia was a tropical region known as the high-populated country in the World, with a 52.9% area with a high mean air temperature and over 267.7 million populations.

We used the K-means cluster method and Fisher's exact test to determine climatic conditions, population density, and COVID-19 clusters and study the correlation. Our research found that there is a correlation between climatic conditions and population density with COVID-19 (p: 0,034;p:0,004).

460629,From SARS-COV to NCOV-2019: Ruction and argument,2020,"It is widely held that schizophrenia involves an active process of peripheral inflammation that induces or reflects brain inflammation with activation of microglia, the brain's resident immune cells. However, recent in vivo radioligand binding studies and large-scale transcriptomics in post-mortem brain report reduced markers of microglial inflammation. The findings suggest a contrary hypothesis; that microglia are diverted into their non-inflammatory synaptic remodelling phenotype that interferes with neurodevelopment and perhaps contributes to the relapsing nature of schizophrenia. Recent discoveries on the regulatory interactions between micro- and astroglial cells and immune regulatory T cells (Tregs) cohere with clinical omics data to suggest that: i) disinhibited astrocytes mediate the shift in microglial phenotype via the production of transforming growth factor-beta, which also contributes to the disturbances of dopamine and GABA function in schizophrenia, and ii) systemically impaired functioning of Treg cells contributes to the dysregulation of glial function, the low-grade peripheral inflammation, and the hitherto unexplained predisposition to auto-immunity and reduced life-expectancy in schizophrenia, including greater COVID-19 mortality.","Corsi-Zuelli, Fabiana; Deakin, Bill",Neurosci Biobehav Rev,,559

470137,"Characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 Transmission among Meat Processing Workers in Nebraska, USA, and Effectiveness of Risk Mitigation Measures",2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a life intimidating viral infection caused by a positive sense RNA virus belonging to the Coronaviridae family, named severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARA-CoV-2). Since its outbreak in December 2019, the pandemic has spread to more than 200 countries, infected more than 26 million, and claimed the lives of more than 800,000 people. As a disease, COVID-19 can lead to severe and occasionally fatal respiratory problems in humans. Infection with this virus is associated with fever, cough, dyspnea, and muscle aches, and it may progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death. To date, there is no specific antiviral treatment against this virus. However, the main viral protease has been recently discovered and it is regarded as an appropriate target for antiviral agents in the search for treatment of COVID-19, due to its pivotal role in polyproteins processing during viral replication. AIM: Consequently, this study intends to evaluate the effectiveness of FDA-approved anti-viral drugs against SARA-CoV-2 through a molecular docking study. METHODS: AutoDock Vina in PyRx platform was used for docking analysis against the main viral protease (Mpro) (PDB ID 6LU7), and Computed Atlas of Surface Topography of proteins (CASTp 3.0) was applied for detecting and characterizing cavities, pockets, and channels of this protein structure. RESULTS: Results revealed that among the conventional antiviral drugs, the protease inhibitors, lopinavir, amprenavir, indinavir, maraviroc, saquinavir, and daclatasvir showed high binding affinity and interacted with amino acid residues of the binding site. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, protease inhibitors may be effective potential antiviral agents against Mpro to combat SARSCoV-2.","Mondal, Milon; Sarkar, Chandan; Jamaddar, Sarmin; Khalipha, Abul Bashar Ripon; Islam, Muhammad Torequl; Mahafzah, Azmi; Mubarak, Mohammad S",Infectious disorders.

This cohort study determined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare-seeking behaviors among frequent ED users at Taipei City Hospital, Taiwan. We included ED users aged &#8805; 18 years admitted to Taipei City Hospital during February 2019-January 2020 (before the pandemic) and February 2020-January 2021 (during the pandemic). Frequent ED users were patients with four or more ED visits per year. Stepwise logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of frequent ED use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Frequent ED users had shorter hospital stays in the ED during the pandemic. After adjusting for sociodemographic factors and other covariates, patients with a triage status of level 4-5, pneumonia diagnosis, giddiness, or dyspnea were more likely frequent ED visitors during the COVID-19 pandemic. To reduce the risk of acquiring COVID-19, it is important to utilize territorial healthcare or telehealth to avoid inappropriate ED visits for patients with a low level of risk or chronic disease.","Chou, Yi-Chang; Yen, Yung-Feng; Chu, Dachen; Hu, Hsiao-Yun",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,559
493806,Cross-species Functional Alignment Reveals Evolutionary Hierarchy Within the Connectome,2020,"Inventory classification is a fundamental issue in the development of inventory policy that assigns each inventory item to several classes with different levels of importance. This classification is the main determinant of a suitable inventory control policy of inventory classes. Therefore, a great deal of research is done on solving this problem. Usually, the problem of inventory classification is considered in a multi-criteria and uncertain environment. The proposed method in this paper inspired by the notion of heterogeneous decision-making problems in which decision-makers deal with different types of data. To this aim, a mathematical modeling-based approach is proposed considering different types of uncertainty in classification information. Demand information is considered to be stochastic due to its time-varying nature and cost information is considered to be fuzzy due to its cognitive ambiguity. A hybrid algorithm based on chance-constrained and possibilistic programming is proposed to solve the problems. Considering the stochastic nature of demand information, solving the proposed model using the hybrid algorithm, the classification of items to three classes of extremely important, class A, moderately important, class B, and relatively unimportant, class C, items are determined along with a minimum inventory level required to deal with the stochasticity of demands information. The proposed approach is applied to a case study of classifying 51 inventory items. The obtained results assigned 22%, 39%, and 39% of the items to A, B, and C classes, respectively.","Razavi Hajiagha, Seyed Hossein; Daneshvar, Maryam; Antucheviciene, Jurgita",Soft comput,,559

Elite cues embedded in mainstream media can influence public opinion on climate change, so it is important to understand whose perspectives are most likely to be represented. Here, I use plagiarism-detection software to analyze the media coverage of a large random sample of business, government, and social advocacy organizations' press releases about climate change (n = 1,768), examining which messages are cited in all articles published about climate change in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and USA Today from 1985 to 2014 (n = 34,948). I find that press releases opposing action to address climate change are about twice as likely to be cited in national newspapers as are press releases advocating for climate action. In addition, messages from business coalitions and very large businesses are more likely than those from other types of organizations to receive coverage. Surprisingly, press releases from organizations providing scientific and technical services are less likely to receive news coverage than are other press releases in my sample, suggesting that messages from organizations with greater scientific expertise receive less media attention. These findings support previous scholars' claims that journalistic norms of balance and objectivity have distorted the public debate around climate change, while providing evidence that the structural power of business interests lends them heightened visibility in policy debates.","Wetts, Rachel",Proc.

Sonification is often used in the context of biofeedback as it can represent an informational, non-invasive and real-time stimulus to monitor, motivate or modify human behavior. The first goal of this study is the proposal and evaluation of a distance-based biofeedback system using a tempo- and phase-aligned sonification strategy to adapt breathing patterns and induce states of relaxation. A second goal is the evaluation of several sonification stimuli on 18 participants that were recruited online and of which we analyzed psychometric and behavioral data using, respectively questionnaires and respiration rate and ratio. Sonification stimuli consisted of filtered noise mimicking a breathing sound, nature environmental sounds and a musical phrase. Preliminary results indicated the nature stimulus as most pleasant and as leading to the most prominent decrease of respiration rate. The noise sonification had the most beneficial effect on respiration ratio. While further research is needed to generalize these findings, this study and its methodological underpinnings suggest the potential of the proposed biofeedback system to perform ecologically valid experiments at participants' homes during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Van Kerrebroeck, B.; Maes, P.

The possible ideal strategy of testing each patient before each shift with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) is not feasible. We aimed to study the effectiveness of fortnightly screening with RT‐PCR for SARS‐CoV‐2 in curbing transmission. METHODS: Between July 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020, all 273 patients receiving hemodialysis were subjected to fortnightly testing for SARS‐Cov‐2 in the unit to detect asymptomatic patients. The cost and effectiveness of universal testing in preventing transmission were analyzed using susceptible‐infectious‐removed (SIR) modeling assuming R (0) of 2.2. RESULTS: Of 273 MHD patients, 55 (20.1%) found infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 over 3 months. Six (10.9%) were symptomatic, and 49 (89.1%) asymptomatic at the time of testing. Six (10.9%) asymptomatic patients develop symptoms later, and 43 (78.2%) remained asymptomatic. A total of seven (6.1%) HCWs also tested positive for the virus. Fortnightly universal testing is cost‐effective, and SIR modeling proved effective in preventing person‐to‐person transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated universal testing in maintenance hemodialysis patients detected 89% of asymptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 patients over 3 months and appeared to be an effective strategy to prevent person‐to‐person transmission in the dialysis unit.","Patel, Manas R.; Kushwaha, Ravi S.; Behera, Manas; Bhadauria, Dharmendra S.; Yachha, Monika; Kaul, Anupma; Prasad, Narayan",Semin Dial,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34169574/; https://doi.org/10.1111/sdi.12997,559

Pathogenesis of the vascular thrombosis in COVID-19 is least understood for now and presents a challenge to the treating physicians. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative pathogen for COVID-19, has been shown to bind to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein in human epithelial cells which facilitates its entry in the organ and mediate tissue specific pathogenesis. For ACE2 mediated cell entry of the SARS-CoV-2, co-expression of one more protein—Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential. Existing studies suggested significant expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in human vascular endothelium. Vascular endothelial dysfunction can potentially activate coagulation cascade eventually resulting in thrombosis. ACE2 has proven role in the maintenance of endothelial integrity inside the vessels. Existing in situ evidence for SARS-CoV-1 (the causative agent for SARS pandemic of 2002, which shared ACE2 as cell entry receptor) suggested that virus binding can downregulate ACE2, thus can induce endothelial dysfunction. Recently, in situ evidence has been presented that SARS-CoV-2 can infect cells in engineered human vascular endothelium, which can be effectively blocked by using clinical-grade recombinant human ACE2. Based on the circumstantial evidence present in the literature, we propose a SARS-CoV-2 cell entry receptor ACE2 based mechanism for vascular thrombosis in COVID-19 patients.","Kumar, Ashutosh; Narayan, Ravi K.; Kumari, Chiman; Faiq, Muneeb A.; Kulandhasamy, Maheswari; Kant, Kamla; Pareek, Vikas",Med Hypotheses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33032170/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720320430; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720320430?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110320,559
594519,Lack of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Transmission in Rabbits,2019-04-24,"China’s progress on communicable disease control (CDC) in the 30 years after establishment of the People’s Republic in 1949 is widely regarded as remarkable. Life expectancy soared by around 30 years, infant mortality plummeted and smallpox, sexually transmitted diseases and many other infections were either eliminated or decreased massively in incidence, largely as a result of CDC. By the mid-1970s, China was already undergoing the epidemiologic transition, years ahead of other nations of similar economic status. These early successes can be attributed to population mobilization, mass campaigns and a focus on sanitation, hygiene, clean water and clean delivery, and occurred despite political instability and slow economic progress. The 10-year Cultural Revolution from 1966 brought many hardships, but also clinical care and continuing public health programs to the masses through community-funded medical schemes and the establishment of community-based health workers. These people-focused approaches broke down with China’s market reforms from 1980. Village doctors turned to private practice as community funding ceased, and the attention paid to rural public health declined. CDC relied on vertical programs, some of them successful (such as elimination of lymphatic filariasis and child immunisation), but others (such as control of schistosomiasis and tuberculosis) demonstrating only intermittent progress due to failed strategies or reliance on support by the poorest governments and health workers, who could not or would not collaborate. In addition, China’s laissez-faire approach to public health placed it at great risk, as evidenced by the outbreak in 2003 of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. Since then, major changes to disease reporting, the priority given to CDC including through major new domestic resources and reform of China’s health system offer encouragement for CDC. While decentralized funding and varying quality diagnosis, reporting and treatment of infectious diseases remain major challenges, national priority on CDC in China is high.","Hipgrave, David",J Glob Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23198121/,559

The main viral protease (nsp5) of SARS-CoV-2 provides an excellent target for antivirals, due to its essential and conserved function in the viral replication cycle. We have expressed, purified and developed assays for nsp5 protease activity. We screened the nsp5 protease against a custom chemical library of over 5,000 characterised pharmaceuticals. We identified calpain inhibitor I and three different peptidyl fluoromethylketones (FMK) as inhibitors of nsp5 activity in vitro, with IC50 values in the low micromolar range. By altering the sequence of our peptidomimetic FMK inhibitors to better mimic the substrate sequence of nsp5, we generated an inhibitor with a subnanomolar IC50. Calpain inhibitor I inhibited viral infection in monkey-derived Vero E6 cells, with an EC50 in the low micromolar range.

We assessed if clinical characteristics and blood inflammatory biomarkers could be used to distinguish bacterial from viral pneumonia. METHODS: Western Australian children (≤17 years) hospitalized with radiologically-confirmed community-acquired pneumonia were recruited and clinical symptoms and management data were collected. C-reactive protein (CRP), white cell counts (WCC) and absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) were measured as part of routine care. Clinical characteristics and biomarker levels were compared between cases with definite bacterial pneumonia (clinical empyema and/or bacteria detected in blood or pleural fluid), presumed viral pneumonia (presence of ≥1 virus in nasopharyngeal swab without criteria for definite bacterial pneumonia), and other pneumonia cases (pneumonia in the absence of criteria for either definite bacterial or presumed viral pneumonia). The area-under-curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for varying biomarker levels were used to characterise their utility for discriminating definite bacterial from presumed viral pneumonia. For biomarkers with AUC > 0.8 (fair discriminator), Youden index was measured to determine the optimal cut-off threshold, and sensitivity, specificity, predictive values (positive and negative) were calculated. We investigated whether better discrimination could be achieved by combining biomarker values with the presence/absence of symptoms. RESULTS: From May 2015 to October 2017, 230 pneumonia cases were enrolled: 30 with definite bacterial pneumonia, 118 with presumed viral pneumonia and 82 other pneumonia cases. Differences in clinical signs and symptoms across the groups were noted; more definite bacterial pneumonia cases required intravenous fluid and oxygen supplementation than presumed viral or other pneumonia cases. CRP, WCC and ANC were substantially higher in definite bacterial cases. For a CRP threshold of 72 mg/L, the AUC of ROC was 0.82 for discriminating definite bacterial pneumonia from presumed viral pneumonia. Combining the CRP with either the presence of fever (≥38(ο)C) or the absence of rhinorrhea improved the discrimination. CONCLUSIONS: Combining elevated CRP with the presence or absence of clinical signs/ symptoms differentiates definite bacterial from presumed viral pneumonia better than CRP alone. Further studies are required to explore combination of biomarkers and symptoms for use as definitive diagnostic tool.

Objective: The main aim of this study was to test the mediating effect of existential anxiety, activated by COVID-19 and life satisfaction (SWLS) on the relationship between PTSD symptoms and post-traumatic growth (PTG). We also examined the moderated mediating effect of severity of trauma symptoms on life satisfaction and existential anxiety and its associations with PTG. Method: We conducted an online survey during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in Poland. The participants completed existential anxiety scale (SNE), life satisfaction scale (SWLS), IES-R scale for measuring the level of PTSD symptoms and post-traumatic growth inventory (PTGI). Results: The effect of PTSD on PTG was found to be mediated by existential anxiety and life satisfaction. We also confirmed two indirect effects: (1) the indirect effect of PTSD on PTG via existential anxiety and life satisfaction tested simultaneously; (2) the indirect effect of life satisfaction on PTG through severity of trauma symptoms. An intermediate or high level of PTSD level was related to less PTG when low and full PTSD stress symptoms strengthened PTG experiences. Conclusions: A therapeutic intervention for individuals after traumatic experience should attempt to include fundamental existential questions and meaning of life as well as the severity of PTSD symptoms. The severity of traumatic sensations may affect the relationship between life satisfaction and post-traumatic growth.","Tomaszek, Katarzyna; Muchacka-Cymerman, Agnieszka",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17197062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32992515/,559

Outcomes of patients with COVID-19-related ARDS compared to ARDS unrelated to COVID-19 is not well characterized. AREAS COVERED: We performed a systematic review of PubMed, Scopus, and MedRxiv 11/1/2019 to 3/1/2021, including studies comparing outcomes in COVID-19-related ARDS (COVID-19 group) and ARDS unrelated to COVID-19 (ARDS group). Outcomes investigated were duration of mechanical ventilation-free days, intensive care unit (ICU) length-of-stay (LOS), hospital LOS, and mortality. Random effects models were fit for each outcome measure. Effect sizes were reported as pooled median differences of medians (MDMs), mean differences (MDs), or odds ratios (ORs). EXPERT OPINION: Ten studies with 2,281 patients met inclusion criteria (COVID-19: 861 [37.7%], ARDS: 1420 [62.3%]). There were no significant differences between the COVID-19 and ARDS groups for median number of mechanical ventilator-free days (MDM: −7.0 [95% CI: −14.8; 0.7], p = 0.075), ICU LOS (MD: 3.1 [95% CI: −5.9; 12.1], p = 0.501), hospital LOS (MD: 2.5 [95% CI: −5.6; 10.7], p = 0.542), or all-cause mortality (OR: 1.25 [95% CI: 0.78; 1.99], p = 0.361).

Data collected over the past year, however, suggest that a diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis, psoriasis, or inflammatory bowel diseases does not increase risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe COVID-19 compared with people without these diseases. Furthermore, substantial data suggest that certain medications frequently used in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, in particular cytokine inhibitors, might even lower the risk for severe COVID-19. Conversely, glucocorticoids and potentially B-cell-depleting treatments seem to worsen COVID-19 outcomes. Additionally, the first data on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with these diseases suggest that tolerability of vaccination in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases is good, although the immune response to vaccination can be somewhat reduced in this patient group, particularly those taking methotrexate or CD20-targeted treatment.","Fagni, Filippo; Simon, David; Tascilar, Koray; Schoenau, Verena; Sticherling, Michael; Neurath, Markus F; Schett, Georg",Lancet Rheumatol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2665991321002472; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34485930/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2665991321002472; https://doi.org/10.1016/s2665-9913(21)00247-2,559

Thus, this work aimed to study postpartum women's mental health in Argentina during mandatory social isolation. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from May to July 2020, which included five validated questionnaires to assess postpartum depression (Postpartum Depression Screening Scale‐Short Form), insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index), memory complaints (Memory Complaint Scale), metacognition (Brief Metamemory and Metaconcentration Scale), and breastfeeding self-efficacy (Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale-Short Form). Sociodemographic variables, social isolation characteristics, and breastfeeding practices were also collected. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Statistical analysis included zero-order correlations, multiple logistic regressions, and a set of structural equation models (SEM) to test direct and indirect effects. Goodness-of-fit indices were calculated for SEM. SETTING: Postpartum women were recruited from public hospitals, private health clinics, and online community recruitment in the Cordoba province (Argentina). PARTICIPANTS: 305 postpartum women from Argentina. MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS: 37% of women reported postpartum depression, 46% insomnia, 42% memory impairment, 60% low metaconcentration, 50% low metamemory, and 23% low breastfeeding efficacy. Also, significant associations were found demonstrating that social isolation promoted postpartum depression and insomnia were reciprocally related, which compromised female cognition and efficacy. This situation was aggravated in women during late postpartum, with previous children, and by low social support (e.g., family, health professionals), with non-exclusive breastfeeding being increased. KEY CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study addressing postpartum women's mental status during social isolation in Argentina, which was a promoting factor for postpartum depression and insomnia that were reciprocally related. This situation was also aggravated by reproductive factors, such as late postpartum, multiparity, breastfeeding frequency, and non-exclusive breastfeeding. Additionally, breastfeeding self-efficacy depended on mental health status, and euthymia therefore favoured the practice of exclusive breastfeeding.","Miranda, Agustín Ramiro; Scotta, Ana Veronica; Cortez, Mariela Valentina; Soria, Elio Andrés",Midwifery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.midw.2021.103072; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0266613821001522; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0266613821001522; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34218023/,559

617428,Phylogenetic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage suggest a single origin followed by multiple exportation events versus convergent evolution,2021-03-27,"We have used a three-dimensional, non-equilibrium multiphase flow numerical model to simulate subplinian eruption scenarios at La Soufrière de Guadeloupe (Lesser Antilles, France). Initial and boundary conditions for computer simulations were set on the basis of independent estimates of eruption source parameters (i.e. mass eruption rate, volatile content, temperature, grain size distribution) from a field reconstruction of the 1530 CE subplinian eruption. This event is here taken as a reference scenario for hazard assessment at La Soufrière de Guadeloupe. A parametric study on eruption source parameters allowed us to quantify their influence on the simulated dynamics and, in particular, the increase of the percentage of column collapse and pyroclastic density current (PDC) intensity, at constant mass eruption rate, with variable vent diameter. Numerical results enabled us to quantify the effects of the proximal morphology on distributing the collapsing mass around the volcano and into deep and long valleys and to estimate the areas invaded by PDCs, their associated temperature and dynamic pressure. Significant impact (temperature > 300 °C and dynamic pressure > 1 kPa) in the inhabited region around the volcano is expected for fully collapsing conditions and mass eruption rates > 2 × 10(7) kg/s. We thus combine this spatial distribution of temperature and dynamic pressure with an objective consideration of model-related uncertainty to produce preliminary PDC hazard maps for the reference scenario. In such a representation, we identify three areas of varying degree of susceptibility to invasion by PDCs—very likely to be invaded (and highly impacted), susceptible to invasion (and moderately impacted), and unlikely to be invaded (or marginally impacted). The study also raises some key questions about the use of deterministic scenario simulations for hazard assessment, where probability distributions and uncertainties are difficult to estimate. Use of high-performance computing techniques will in part allow us to overcome such difficulties, but the problem remains open in a scientific context where validation of numerical models is still, necessarily, an incomplete and ongoing process. Nevertheless, our findings provide an important contribution to the quantitative assessment of volcanic hazard and risk at La Soufrière de Guadeloupe particularly in the context of the current unrest of the volcano and the need to prepare for a possible future reawakening of the volcano that could culminate in a magmatic explosive eruption.

Therefore, we explored real-world effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination on subsequent infection in IBD patients with diverse exposure to immunosuppressive medications. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of patients in the Veterans Health Administration with IBD diagnosed prior to 12/18/20, the start date of the VHA patient vaccination program. IBD medication exposures included 5-aminosalicylic acid, thiopurines, anti-tumor necrosis factor biologic agents, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, tofacitinib, methotrexate, and corticosteroid use. We used inverse probability weighting and Cox regression with vaccination status as a time-updating exposure, and computed vaccine effectiveness from incidence rates. Results The cohort comprised 14,697 patients, 7,321 of whom received at least one vaccine dose (45.2% Pfizer, 54.8% Moderna). The cohort had median age 68 years, was 92.2% male, 80.4% white, and 61.8% with ulcerative colitis. In follow-up data through April 20, 2021, unvaccinated individuals had the highest raw proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection (197 [1.34%] versus 7 [0.11%] fully vaccinated).

633349,Acute febrile respiratory infection symptoms in Australian Hajjis at risk of exposure to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,2013-10-07,"OBJECTIVES: To compare clinical characteristics and outcomes of children admitted to the PICU for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2–related illness with or without multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. The secondary objective was to identify explanatory factors associated with outcome of critical illness defined by a composite index of in-hospital mortality and organ system support requirement. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Thirty-eight PICUs within the Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness Universal Study registry from March 2020 to January 2021. PATIENTS: Children less than 18 years with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2–related illness with or without multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 394 patients, 171 (43.4%) had multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children were more likely younger (2–12 yr vs adolescents; p < 0.01), Black (35.6% vs 21.9%; p < 0.01), present with fever/abdominal pain than cough/dyspnea (p < 0.01), and less likely to have comorbidities (33.3% vs 61.9%; p < 0.01) compared with those without multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Inflammatory marker levels, use of inotropes/vasopressors, corticosteroids, and anticoagulants were higher in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children patients (p < 0.01). Overall mortality was 3.8% (15/394), with no difference in the two groups. Diagnosis of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children was associated with longer duration of hospitalization as compared to nonmultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (7.5 d[interquartile range, 5–11] vs 5.3 d [interquartile range, 3–11 d]; p < 0.01). Critical illness occurred in 164 patients (41.6%) and was more common in patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children compared with those without (55.6% vs 30.9%; p < 0.01). Multivariable analysis failed to show an association between critical illness and age, race, sex, greater than or equal to three signs and symptoms, or greater than or equal to two comorbidities among the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children cohort. Among nonmultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children patients, the presence of greater than or equal to two comorbidities was associated with greater odds of critical illness (odds ratio 2.95 [95% CI, 1.61–5.40]; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study delineates significant clinically relevant differences in presentation, explanatory factors, and outcomes among children admitted to PICU with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2–related illness stratified by multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children.","Tripathi, Sandeep; Gist, Katja M.; Bjornstad, Erica C.; Kashyap, Rahul; Boman, Karen; Chiotos, Kathleen; Gharpure, Varsha P.; Dapul, Heda; Sayed, Imran A.; Kuehne, Joshua; Heneghan, Julia A.; Gupta, Manoj; Khandhar, Paras B.; Menon, Shina; Gupta, Neha; Kumar, Vishakha K.; Retford, Lynn; Zimmerman, Jerry; Bhalala, Utpal S.",Pediatr Crit Care Med,https://doi.org/10.1097/pcc.0000000000002760; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33965987/,559

A walk-through (WT) screening center using negative pressure booths that is inspired by the biosafety cabinet has been designed and implemented in Korea for easy screening of COVID-19 and for safe and efficient consultation for patients with fever or respiratory symptoms. Here, we present the overall concept, advantages, and limitations of the COVID-19 WT screening center. The WT center increases patient access to the screening clinics and adequately protects healthcare personnel while reducing the consumption of personal protective equipment. It can also increase the number of people tested by 9–10 fold. However, there is a risk of cross-infection at each stage of screening treatment, including the booths, and adverse reactions with disinfection of the booths. These limitations can be overcome using mobile technology and increasing the number of booths to reduce congestion inside the center, reducing booth volume for sufficient and rapid ventilation, and using an effective, harmless, and certified environmental disinfectant. A WT center can be implemented in other institutions and countries and modified depending on local needs to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kim, Sang Il; Lee, Ji Yong",J Korean Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e154; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32301300/,559

638003,SARS-CoV-2 infects and damages the mature and immature olfactory sensory neurons of hamsters,2020-07-15,"BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic brought significant disruption to in-hospital medical training. Virtual reality simulating the clinical environment has the potential to overcome this issue and can be particularly useful to supplement the traditional in-hospital medical training during the COVID-19 pandemic, when hospital access is banned for medical students. The aim of this study was to assess medical students’ perception on fully online training including simulated clinical scenarios during COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: From May to July 2020 when in-hospital training was not possible, 122 students attending the sixth year of the course of Medicine and Surgery underwent online training sessions including an online platform with simulated clinical scenarios (Body Interact™) of 21 patient-based cases. Each session focused on one case, lasted 2 h and was divided into three different parts: introduction, virtual patient-based training, and debriefing. In the same period, adjunctive online training with formal presentation and discussion of clinical cases was also given. At the completion of training, a survey was performed, and students filled in a 12-item anonymous questionnaire on a voluntary basis to rate the training quality. Results were reported as percentages or with numeric ratings from 1 to 4. Due to the study design, no sample size was calculated. RESULTS: One hundred and fifteen students (94%) completed the questionnaire: 104 (90%) gave positive evaluation to virtual reality training and 107 (93%) appreciated the format in which online training was structured. The majority of participants considered the platform of virtual reality training realistic for the initial clinical assessment (77%), diagnostic activity (94%), and treatment options (81%). Furthermore, 97 (84%) considered the future use of this virtual reality training useful in addition to the apprenticeship at patient’s bedside. Finally, 32 (28%) participants found the online access difficult due to technical issues. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, online medical training including simulated clinical scenarios avoided training interruption and the majority of participant students gave a positive response on the perceived quality of this training modality. During this time frame, a non-negligible proportion of students experienced difficulties in online access to this virtual reality platform.","De Ponti, Roberto; Marazzato, Jacopo; Maresca, Andrea M.; Rovera, Francesca; Carcano, Giulio; Ferrario, Marco M.",BMC Med Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32977781/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-020-02245-8,559

There are no validated lower airway biomarkers to predict clinical outcome. We investigated whether bacterial respiratory infections were associated with poor clinical outcome of COVID-19 in a prospective, observational cohort of 589 critically ill adults, all of whom required mechanical ventilation. For a subset of 142 patients who underwent bronchoscopy, we quantified SARS-CoV-2 viral load, analysed the lower respiratory tract microbiome using metagenomics and metatranscriptomics and profiled the host immune response. Acquisition of a hospital-acquired respiratory pathogen was not associated with fatal outcome. Poor clinical outcome was associated with lower airway enrichment with an oral commensal (Mycoplasma salivarium). Increased SARS-CoV-2 abundance, low anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response and a distinct host transcriptome profile of the lower airways were most predictive of mortality. Our data provide evidence that secondary respiratory infections do not drive mortality in COVID-19 and clinical management strategies should prioritize reducing viral replication and maximizing host responses to SARS-CoV-2.","Sulaiman, Imran; Chung, Matthew; Angel, Luis; Tsay, Jun-Chieh J; Wu, Benjamin G; Yeung, Stephen T; Krolikowski, Kelsey; Li, Yonghua; Duerr, Ralf; Schluger, Rosemary; Thannickal, Sara A; Koide, Akiko; Rafeq, Samaan; Barnett, Clea; Postelnicu, Radu; Wang, Chang; Banakis, Stephanie; Pérez-Pérez, Lizzette; Shen, Guomiao; Jour, George; Meyn, Peter; Carpenito, Joseph; Liu, Xiuxiu; Ji, Kun; Collazo, Destiny; Labarbiera, Anthony; Amoroso, Nancy; Brosnahan, Shari; Mukherjee, Vikramjit; Kaufman, David; Bakker, Jan; Lubinsky, Anthony; Pradhan, Deepak; Sterman, Daniel H; Weiden, Michael; Heguy, Adriana; Evans, Laura; Uyeki, Timothy M; Clemente, Jose C; de Wit, Emmie; Schmidt, Ann Marie; Shopsin, Bo; Desvignes, Ludovic; Wang, Chan; Li, Huilin; Zhang, Bin; Forst, Christian V; Koide, Shohei; Stapleford, Kenneth A; Khanna, Kamal M",Nat Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34465900/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-021-00961-5,559

The method can produce up to 10(9) copies of the amplified DNA within less than an hour. It is also highly specific due to the use of two to three pairs of primers (internal, external, and loop), which recognise up to eight specific locations on the DNA or RNA targets. Furthermore, the Bst DNA polymerase most used in LAMP shows a high strand displacement activity, which eliminates the DNA denaturation stage. One of the most significant advantages of LAMP is that it can be conducted at a stable temperature, for instance, in a dry block heater or an incubator. The products of LAMP can be detected much faster than in standard techniques, sometimes only requiring analysis with the naked eye. The following overview highlights the usefulness of LAMP and its effectiveness in various fields; it also considers the superiority of LAMP over PCR and presents RT-LAMP as a rapid diagnostic tool for SARS-CoV-2.","Soroka, Marianna; Wasowicz, Barbara; Rymaszewska, Anna",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34440699/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10081931,559

However, conventional learning (CL) has cost, time, and space constraints. This study aimed to evaluate whether laypersons who completed instructor-led distance learning (DL) acquired a level of CPR skill comparable to that achieved via CL training. METHODS: This randomized controlled study recruited students from 28 Korean high schools who were randomized to complete instructor-led DL or CL training. The CL training involved classroom-based face-to-face training, whereas the instructor-led DL training was provided online using a videoconferencing system. RESULTS: The study enrolled 62 students who were randomized to the CL group (31 participants) or the DL group (31 participants). Relative to the CL group, the DL group achieved remarkably similar results in terms of most CPR variables. In addition, the DL group had a significant improvement in the mean compression depth (before: 46 mm [interquartile range: 37–52 mm] vs. after: 49 mm [interquartile range: 46–54 mm], p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Instructor-led DL can be a suitable alternative to CL for providing CPR training to laypersons. In settings like the current COVID-19 pandemic, where face-to-face CL is not practical, DL may be a useful tool for delivering CPR training.","Han, Sangsoo; Park, Hye Ji; Nah, Sangun; Lee, Eun Hae; Lee, Hyun Ji; Park, Ju Ok; Lee, Choung Ah",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33956873/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251277,559

Current evidence is limited on access to care for older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives: To examine the extent of reduced access to care among older American adults during the COVID-19 pandemic, identify predictors and reasons of reduced access. Materials and methods: Using publicly available data from the COVID-19 module of the Health and Retirement Study, we undertook descriptive analyses of older adults stratified by sex, age group, race, education, marital status, employment, receipt of social security benefits, health insurance, number of limitations in activities of daily living and pre-existing conditions. Associations between reduced access to care and predictors were estimated using a multivariable logistic regression model. Results: About 30 per cent of respondents delayed or avoided care during the pandemic. Reduced access was more likely to be reported by respondents that were female, younger, educated, not receiving social security benefits, with limitations in daily activities and three preexisting conditions. In terms of the reasons, the majority of the respondents reported that their visit was either cancelled or rescheduled by the provider; 13.9 per cent thought they could wait, 10.9 per cent could not get an appointment, 9.1 per cent found it unaffordable, and 7.4 per cent were afraid to visit the provider. Respondents reported of reduced access to doctor visits, surgery, prescription filling, and dental care. Conclusions: We suggest urgent attention on improving access to care for older adults during the pandemic. For nonemergency conditions and routine care that can be delivered virtually, telehealth services can be strengthened. Additionally, health messaging can reemphasize that neglecting medical care might lead to increased morbidity and mortality among older adults from preexisting illnesses.","Das, A.; Mishra, D.

644224,Clinical and Laboratory Findings of the First Imported Case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus to the United States,2014-08-06,"BACKGROUND: The determinants of successful humoral immune response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are of critical importance for the design of effective vaccines and the evaluation of the degree of protective immunity conferred by exposure to the virus. As novel variants emerge, understanding their likelihood of suppression by population antibody repertoires has become increasingly important. METHODS: In this study, we analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 polyclonal antibody response in a large population of clinically well-characterized patients after mild and severe COVID-19 using a panel of microarrayed structurally folded and unfolded SARS-CoV-2 proteins, as well as sequential peptides, spanning the surface spike protein (S) and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the virus. RESULTS: S- and RBD-specific antibody responses were dominated by immunoglobulin G (IgG), mainly IgG1 , and directed against structurally folded S and RBD and three distinct peptide epitopes in S2. The virus neutralization activity of patients´ sera was highly correlated with IgG antibodies specific for conformational but not sequential RBD epitopes and their ability to prevent RBD binding to its human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Twenty percent of patients selectively lacked RBD-specific IgG. Only immunization with folded, but not with unfolded RBD, induced antibodies against conformational epitopes with high virus-neutralizing activity. Conformational RBD epitopes required for protection do not seem to be altered in the currently emerging virus variants. CONCLUSION: These results are fundamental for estimating the protective activity of antibody responses after natural infection or vaccination and for the design of vaccines, which can induce high levels of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies conferring sterilizing immunity.","Gattinger, Pia; Niespodziana, Katarzyna; Stiasny, Karin; Sahanic, Sabina; Tulaeva, Inna; Borochova, Kristina; Dorofeeva, Yulia; Schlederer, Thomas; Sonnweber, Thomas; Hofer, Gerhard; Kiss, Renata; Kratzer, Bernhard; Trapin, Doris; Tauber, Peter A; Rottal, Arno; Körmöczi, Ulrike; Feichter, Melanie; Weber, Milena; Focke-Tejkl, Margarete; Löffler-Ragg, Judith; Mühl, Bernhard; Kropfmüller, Anna; Keller, Walter; Stolz, Frank; Henning, Rainer; Tancevski, Ivan; Puchhammer-Stöckl, Elisabeth; Pickl, Winfried F; Valenta, Rudolf",Allergy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34453317/; https://doi.org/10.1111/all.15066,559

656182,Overview of preparedness and response for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Oman,2014-10-29,"The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak is a major challenge for public health. SARS-CoV-2 infection in human has a broad clinical spectrum ranging from mild to severe cases, with a mortality rate of ~6.4% worldwide (based on World Health Organization daily situation report). However, the dynamics of viral infection, replication and shedding are poorly understood. Here, we show that Rhesus macaques are susceptible to the infection by SARS-CoV-2. After intratracheal inoculation, the first peak of viral RNA was observed in oropharyngeal swabs one day post infection (1 d.p.i.), mainly from the input of the inoculation, while the second peak occurred at 5 d.p.i., which reflected on-site replication in the respiratory tract. Histopathological observation shows that SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause interstitial pneumonia in animals, characterized by hyperemia and edema, and infiltration of monocytes and lymphocytes in alveoli. We also identified SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory tract tissues, including trachea, bronchus and lung; and viruses were also re-isolated from oropharyngeal swabs, bronchus and lung, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrated that neutralizing antibodies generated from the primary infection could protect the Rhesus macaques from a second-round challenge by SARS-CoV-2.

660113,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV): Impact on Saudi Arabia, 2015",2016-10-01,"INTRODUCTION: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020, high rates of acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically unwell patients are being reported, leading to an increased demand for renal replacement therapy (RRT). Providing RRT for this large number of patients is proving challenging, and so alternatives to continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) in the intensive care unit (ICU) are needed. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) can be initiated immediately after percutaneous insertion of the catheter, but there are concerns about impact on ventilation and RRT efficacy. We sought to describe our recent experience with percutaneous catheter insertion and peritoneal dialysis in patients in the ICU with COVID-19 infection. METHOD: Patients were selected according to local protocol, and catheters were inserted percutaneously by experienced operators using a Seldinger technique. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and ventilation requirements were recorded at the time of insertion and 24 hours later. Procedural complications, proportion of RRT provided by PD, renal recovery, and RRT parameters (serum potassium and maximum base excess) during PD were assessed. RESULTS: Percutaneous PD catheters were successfully inserted in 37 of 44 patients (84.1%) after a median of 13.5 days (interquartile range [IQR] = 10.0, 20.3 days) in the ICU. No adverse events were reported; SOFA scores and ventilation requirements were comparable before and after insertion; and adequate RRT parameters were achieved. The median proportion of RRT provided by PD following catheter insertion was 94.6% (IQR = 75.0, 100%). CONCLUSION: Peritoneal dialysis provides a safe and effective alternative to CRRT in selected patients with AKI and COVID-19 infection requiring ventilation on intensive care.","Bowes, Elaine; Joslin, Jennifer; Braide-Azikiwe, Dandisonba C.B.; Tulley, Caroline; Bramham, Kate; Saha, Sujit; Jayawardene, Satish; Shakoane, Babakang; Wilkins, C.

Sera were obtained near the onset of RI and 3 to 4 weeks later as part of a prospective study of 200 subjects evaluated for RI from 2009 to 2013. Antibodies against common HCoV strains were measured by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay and neutralization assay comparing older adults with cardiopulmonary diseases (99 subjects) to younger, healthy adults (101 subjects). Virus shedding was detected in respiratory secretions by polymerase chain reaction. Of 43 HCoV‐associated illnesses, 15 (35%) occurred in 14 older adults (aged ≥60 years) and 28 (65%) in 28 younger adults (aged 21‐40 years). Binding and neutralizing antibodies were higher in older adults. Only 16 (35.7%) of RI with increases in binding antibodies also had increases in neutralizing antibodies to HCoV. Increases in binding antibodies with RI were more frequent than increased neutralizing antibodies and virus shedding, and more frequent in younger compared to older adults. Functional neutralizing antibodies were not stimulated as often as binding antibodies, explaining in part a susceptibility to reinfection with HCoV. Monitoring binding antibodies may be more sensitive for the serologic detection of HCoV infections.","Gorse, Geoffrey J.; Donovan, Mary M.; Patel, Gira B.",J Med Virol,https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25715; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32073157/,559

Oral sampling has been described for the detection of dozens of human pathogens, including pathogens whose primary sites of infection are outside of the oral cavity, such as the respiratory pathogens Mycobacterium tuberculosis and SARS-CoV-2. Oral sampling can demonstrate active infections as well as resolving or previous infections, the latter through the detection of antibodies. Its potential applications are diverse, including improved diagnosis in special populations (e.g., children), population surveillance, and infectious disease screening. In this minireview, we address the use of oral samples for the detection of diseases that primarily manifest outside the oral cavity. Focusing on well-supported examples, we describe applications for such methods and highlight their potential advantages and limitations in medicine, public health, and research.","Valinetz, Ethan D.; Cangelosi, Gerard A.",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.02360-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33888590/,559
665101,In-vitro renal epithelial cell infection reveals a viral kidney tropism as a potential mechanism for acute renal failure during Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) Coronavirus infection,2013-12-23,"In December 2019, novel coronavirus pneumonia-19 (COVID-19) was discovered in the viral pneumonia cases that occurred in Wuhan, China, and then quickly spread around the world. This report described the clinical course of two COVID-19 patients and the purpose of the study was to discuss the combination of chest CT and clinical features for diagnosis of COVID-19. The first case was a typical COVID-19 case. A 66-year-old female presented to our hospital with a 3-day history of fever. She had contact with a COVID-19 patient. Chest CT showed a typical COVID-19 appearance. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 by a positive nucleic acid test. The second case was a 50-year-old male with a 2-day history of fever. He denied having been to Wuhan. Chest CT also showed typical features of COVID-19 pneumonia. COVID-19 nucleic acid tests were repeated up to seven times and the results remained controversial. Eventually, he was diagnosed with COVID-19. Our study shows that chest CT has high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19 in clinical practice, particularly when the nucleic acid test is negative. The chest CT should be considered as a diagnostic tool for the COVID-19 screening, comprehensive evaluation, and follow-up and patients would benefit from effective treatments in time.","Wang, Xin; Wen, Peng; Sun, Zhi-Gang; Xing, Chun-Yan; Li, Yun",Open Med (Wars),https://doi.org/10.1515/med-2020-0107; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33336029/,559

669092,Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV): Update 2013,2013-06-23,"BACKGROUND: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical rotations at the University of Michigan Medical School (UMMS) were suspended on March 17, 2020, per the Association of American Medical Colleges’ recommendations. No alternative curriculum existed to fill the educational void for clinical students. The traditional approach to curriculum development was not feasible during the pandemic as faculty were redeployed to clinical care, and the immediate need for continued learning necessitated a new model. APPROACH: One student developed an outline for an online course on pandemics based on peer-to-peer conversations regarding learners’ interests and needs, and she proposed that students author the content given the immediate need for a curriculum. Fifteen student volunteers developed content to fill knowledge gaps, and expert faculty reviewers confirmed that the student authors had successfully curated a comprehensive curriculum. EVALUATION: The crowdsourced student content coalesced into a 40-hour curriculum required for all 371 clinical-level students at UMMS. This student-driven effort took just 17 days from outline to implementation, and the final product is a full course comprising five modules, multiple choice questions, discussion boards, and assignments. Learners were surveyed to gauge success, and 93% rated this content as relevant to all medical students. REFLECTION: The successful implementation of this model for curriculum development, grounded in the Master Adaptive Learner framework, suggests that medical students can be entrusted as stewards of their own education. As we return to a post-pandemic “normal,” this approach could be applied to the maintenance and de novo development of future curricula.

Unfortunately, these reports are not made public in the European Union, thus preventing public scrutiny about the strategies used by multinational companies to displace profits to tax havens. This article applies the Unitary Taxation regime proposed by the European Commission to US multinational companies. The results confirm a strong bias among the profits distribution towards countries with lower corporate tax rates. Likewise, they confirm the capacity of the Unitary Taxation to promote a fairer distribution of tax revenues. These results can be a good contribution to the current Portuguese presidency of the European Union, which managed to gather important support to move forward with the European public country-by-country reporting directive.","Viegas, Miguel; Dias, António",Inter Econ,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10272-021-0974-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34103762/,559

676544,Middle East respiratory syndrome in children: Dental considerations,2017-04-11,"BACKGROUND: Twitter is a real-time messaging platform widely used by people and organizations to share information on many topics. Systematic monitoring of social media posts (infodemiology or infoveillance) could be useful to detect misinformation outbreaks as well as to reduce reporting lag time and to provide an independent complementary source of data compared with traditional surveillance approaches. However, such an analysis is currently not possible in the Arabic-speaking world owing to a lack of basic building blocks for research and dialectal variation. OBJECTIVE: We collected around 4000 Arabic tweets related to COVID-19 and influenza. We cleaned and labeled the tweets relative to the Arabic Infectious Diseases Ontology, which includes nonstandard terminology, as well as 11 core concepts and 21 relations. The aim of this study was to analyze Arabic tweets to estimate their usefulness for health surveillance, understand the impact of the informal terms in the analysis, show the effect of deep learning methods in the classification process, and identify the locations where the infection is spreading. METHODS: We applied the following multilabel classification techniques: binary relevance, classifier chains, label power set, adapted algorithm (multilabel adapted k-nearest neighbors [MLKNN]), support vector machine with naive Bayes features (NBSVM), bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), and AraBERT (transformer-based model for Arabic language understanding) to identify tweets appearing to be from infected individuals. We also used named entity recognition to predict the place names mentioned in the tweets. RESULTS: We achieved an F1 score of up to 88% in the influenza case study and 94% in the COVID-19 one. Adapting for nonstandard terminology and informal language helped to improve accuracy by as much as 15%, with an average improvement of 8%. Deep learning methods achieved an F1 score of up to 94% during the classifying process. Our geolocation detection algorithm had an average accuracy of 54% for predicting the location of users according to tweet content. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified two Arabic social media data sets for monitoring tweets related to influenza and COVID-19. It demonstrated the importance of including informal terms, which are regularly used by social media users, in the analysis. It also proved that BERT achieves good results when used with new terms in COVID-19 tweets. Finally, the tweet content may contain useful information to determine the location of disease spread.","Alsudias, Lama; Rayson, Paul",JMIR Med Inform,https://doi.org/10.2196/27670; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34346892/,559

678466,A review of candidate therapies for Middle East respiratory syndrome from a molecular perspective,2017-09-01,"BACKGROUND: Public health responses to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) including lockdowns may negatively impact physical and mental functioning in clinical populations. People living with multiple sclerosis (MS) may be more susceptible to physical function deterioration while practicing social distancing. Recent reports have suggested that about 50% of people with MS (pwMS) decreased their leisure physical activity during COVID-19, and upwards of 30% reported decreased physical fitness levels. However, the impact of social distancing on adverse health-related outcomes such as falls has not received much scrutiny. Therefore, we explored the frequency and characteristics of falls experienced by people living with and without MS during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Two-hundred and thirty-nine individuals, including 106 pwMS (median age: 59 years) and 133 people living without MS (median age: 66 years) were recruited for this cross-sectional study. A snowball sampling strategy was used for online recruitment. Participants completed a customized falls questionnaire and the number of falls experienced (if any) during COVID-19 was recorded. Fall-related characteristics such as the timing, locations, activities undertaken before falling and consequences, as well as self-reported physical activity were also recorded. RESULTS: Overall, participants reported 232 falls (1.67 falls/person in pwMS and 0.41 falls/person in non-MS participants). People living with MS (pwMS) had a significantly higher frequency of falls (58.5% vs 21.8%; p< 0.001) and recurrent falls (45.3% vs 9.8%; p< 0.001) compared to non-MS participants. Additionally, pwMS reported a significantly higher proportion of in-home falls (83.9% vs 54.2%; p = 0.004), as well as a higher proportion of overall injuries (44.3% vs 12.5%, p< 0.001), fractures (5.7% vs 0.8%, p = 0.048), and healthcare utilization (9.4% vs 1.6%, p = 0.007) compared to non-MS participants. A similar proportion of pwMS (49.1%) and non-MS participants (52.2%) reported lower physical activity levels during COVID-19. CONCLUSION: This cross-sectional study revealed that pwMS remain at high risk of falls and fall-related outcomes during COVID-19. The high number of falls experienced by pwMS is of clinical concern considering the current strain on the healthcare system. Findings from this study highlight the importance of monitoring falls and the potential for telerehabilitation in persons with MS during COVID-19.","Zanotto, Tobia; Frechette, Mikaela L; Koziel, Stephen R; Hsieh, Katherine L; Sosnoff, Jacob J",Mult Scler Relat Disord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34303279/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211034821003783; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211034821003783; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2021.103111,559
679526,Vaccine Development Against Middle East Respiratory Syndrome,2016-07-11,"Despite research going back over a century showing the U.S. census counts some groups more accurately than others at the national level, little is known about how undercount varies within the country. I focus on a population easily measured with administrative data yet known to suffer high levels of undercount—native-born young children—to document state-level variation in undercount by race and Hispanic status. Although the race-specific analysis is only possible for the 2000 census, the patterns I show for all children are similar to those in 2010, implying the results from 2000 are likely relevant to today. Undercount levels vary widely across states, with non-Black children having the highest rates in the south and southwest, and Black children in the northeast. Results by Hispanic status show non-Black Hispanic young children are highly undercounted in several states with high Hispanic populations, but not all, and are also highly undercounted in the northeast and New England. In several states with high non-Black Hispanic undercounts, non-Black non-Hispanic children are also undercounted at a high rate. I find a very strong correlation between the fraction of births to foreign-born mothers in the state and the undercount of Black and non-Black children—in fact, it is the strongest correlate with the undercount of native-born Black children of those I investigate. The fraction of foreign-born mothers does not correlate with the undercount of non-Black Hispanic and non-Hispanic young children, although Hispanic status of the parents do. My results suggest a group-specific, local focus for future work is needed to determine the causes of census undercount.","Johnson, Janna E.",Popul Res Policy Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33897075/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11113-021-09651-w,559
680387,Towards improving clinical management of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection,2014-06-22,"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, in which acute respiratory infections are associated with high socio-economic burden. We applied high-content screening to a well-defined collection of 5632 compounds including 3488 that have undergone previous clinical investigations across 600 indications. The compounds were screened by microscopy for their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 cytopathicity in the human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line, Caco-2. The primary screen identified 258 hits that inhibited cytopathicity by more than 75%, most of which were not previously known to be active against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. These compounds were tested in an eight-point dose response screen using the same image-based cytopathicity readout. For the 67 most active molecules, cytotoxicity data were generated to confirm activity against SARS-CoV-2. We verified the ability of known inhibitors camostat, nafamostat, lopinavir, mefloquine, papaverine and cetylpyridinium to reduce the cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2, providing confidence in the validity of the assay. The high-content screening data are suitable for reanalysis across numerous drug classes and indications and may yield additional insights into SARS-CoV-2 mechanisms and potential therapeutic strategies.","Ellinger, Bernhard; Bojkova, Denisa; Zaliani, Andrea; Cinatl, Jindrich; Claussen, Carsten; Westhaus, Sandra; Keminer, Oliver; Reinshagen, Jeanette; Kuzikov, Maria; Wolf, Markus; Geisslinger, Gerd; Gribbon, Philip; Ciesek, Sandra",Sci Data,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33637768/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-021-00848-4,559

We aimed to investigate its impact on procedure types, indications, and findings. Methods We retrospectively analyzed endoscopies performed in 15 Dutch hospitals by comparing periods 15 March to 25 June of 2019 and 2020 using the prospective Trans.IT database. Results During lockdown in 2020, 9776 patients underwent endoscopy compared with 19 296 in 2019. Gastroscopies decreased by 57 % (from 7846 to 4467) and colonoscopies by 45 % (from 12219 to 5609), whereas endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography volumes remained comparable (from 578 to 522). Although endoscopy results indicative of cancer decreased (from 524 to 340), the likelihood of detecting cancer during endoscopy increased (2.7 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 2.5 – 3.0] in 2019 versus 3.5 % [95 %CI 3.1 – 3.9] in 2020; P < 0.001). After lifting of lockdown, endoscopy volumes started to return to normal, except for colorectal cancer screening. Conclusions Fewer endoscopies were performed during the COVID-19 lockdown, leading to a significant reduction in the absolute detection of cancer. Endoscopies increased rapidly after lockdown, except for colorectal cancer screening.","Lantinga, Marten A.; Theunissen, Felix; ter Borg, Pieter C. J.; Bruno, Marco J.; Ouwendijk, Rob J.

The objective of this study was to test the ivermectin drug in a murine model of coronavirus infection using a type 2 family RNA coronavirus similar to SARS-CoV2, the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). BALB/cJ female mice were infected with 6,000 PFU of MHV-A59 (Group Infected; n=20) and immediately treated with one single dose of 500 μg/kg of ivermectin (Group Infected + IVM; n=20), or were not infected and treated with PBS (Control group; n=16). Five days after infection/treatment, mice were euthanized to obtain different tissues to check general health status and infection levels. Overall results demonstrated that viral infection induces the typical MHV disease in infected animals, with livers showing severe hepatocellular necrosis surrounded by a severe lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltration associated with a high hepatic viral load (52,158 AU), while ivermectin administration showed a better health status with lower viral load (23,192 AU; p<0.05) and few livers with histopathological damage (p<0.05), not showing statistical differences with control mice (P=NS). Furthermore, serum transaminase levels (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) were significantly lower in treated mice compared to infected animals. In conclusion, ivermectin seems to be effective to diminish MHV viral load and disease in mice, being a useful model for further understanding new therapies against coronavirus diseases.","Arévalo, AP; Pagotto, R; Pórfido, J; Daghero, H; Segovia, M; Yamasaki, K; Varela, B; Hill, M; Verdes, JM; Duhalde Vega, M; Bollati-Fogolín, M; Crispo, M",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.02.363242,559
684175,Middle East Respiratory Syndrome - need for increased vigilance and watchful surveillance for MERS-CoV in sub-Saharan Africa,2015-07-02,"Since its outbreak in late 2019, the SARS‐Cov‐2 pandemic already infected over 3.7 million people and claimed more than 250,000 lives globally. At least 1 year may take for an approved vaccine to be in place, and meanwhile millions more could be infected, some with fatal outcome. Over thousand clinical trials with COVID‐19 patients are already listed in ClinicalTrials.com, some of them for assessing the utility of therapeutics approved for other conditions. However, clinical trials take many months, and are typically done with small cohorts. A much faster and by far more efficient method for rapidly identifying approved therapeutics that can be repurposed for treating COVID‐19 patients is data mining their past and current electronic health and prescription records for identifying drugs that may protect infected individuals from severe COVID‐19 symptoms. Examples are discussed for applying health and prescription records for assessing the potential repurposing (repositioning) of angiotensin receptor blockers, estradiol, or antiandrogens for reducing COVID‐19 morbidity and fatalities. Data mining of prescription records of COVID‐19 patients will not cancel the need for conducting controlled clinical trials, but could substantially assist in trial design, drug choice, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and prioritization. This approach requires a strong commitment of health provides for open collaboration with the biomedical research community, as health provides are typically the sole owners of retrospective drug prescription records.","Gurwitz, David",Drug Dev Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32420637/; https://doi.org/10.1002/ddr.21689,559
