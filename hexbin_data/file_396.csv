4593,Public health round-up,2020-03-01,"Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of infections in humans. The emergence of virulent, antibiotic-resistant strains of S. aureus is a significant public health concern. Most virulence and resistance factors in S. aureus are encoded by mobile genetic elements, and transduction by bacteriophages represents the main mechanism for horizontal gene transfer. The baseplate is a specialized structure at the tip of bacteriophage tails that plays key roles in host recognition, cell wall penetration, and DNA ejection. We have used high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structure of the S. aureus bacteriophage 80α baseplate at 3.75 Å resolution, allowing atomic models to be built for most of the major tail and baseplate proteins, including two tail fibers, the receptor binding protein, and part of the tape measure protein. Our structure provides a structural basis for understanding host recognition, cell wall penetration and DNA ejection in viruses infecting Gram-positive bacteria. Comparison to other phages demonstrates the modular design of baseplate proteins, and the adaptations to the host that take place during the evolution of staphylococci and other pathogens.","Kizziah, James L.; Manning, Keith A.; Dearborn, Altaira D.; Dokland, Terje",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7048315/,396

Lancet Glob Health 2014;2:E145–54.",2014-05-14,"An important task of public health officials is to keep track of health issues, such as spreading epidemics. In this paper, we are addressing the issue of spreading public concern about epidemics. Public concern about a communicable disease can be seen as a problem of its own. Keeping track of trends in concern about public health and identifying peaks of public concern are therefore crucial tasks. However, monitoring public health concerns is not only expensive with traditional surveillance systems, but also suffers from limited coverage and significant delays. To address these problems, we are using Twitter messages, which are available free of cost, are generated world-wide, and are posted in real time. We are measuring public concern using a two-step sentiment classification approach. In the first step, we distinguish Personal tweets from News (i.e., Non-Personal) tweets. In the second step, we further separate Personal Negative from Personal Non-Negative tweets. Both these steps consist themselves of two sub-steps. In the first sub-step (of both steps), our programs automatically generate training data using an emotion-oriented, clue-based method. In the second sub-step, we are training and testing three different Machine Learning (ML) models with the training data from the first sub-step; this allows us to determine the best ML model for different datasets. Furthermore, we are testing the already trained ML models with a human annotated, disjoint dataset. Based on the number of tweets classified as Personal Negative, we compute a Measure of Concern (MOC) and a timeline of the MOC. We attempt to correlate peaks of the MOC timeline to peaks of the News (Non-Personal) timeline. Our best accuracy results are achieved using the two-step method with a Naïve Bayes classifier for the Epidemic domain (six datasets) and the Mental Health domain (three datasets).","Ji, Xiang; Chun, Soon Ae; Wei, Zhi; Geller, James",Soc Netw Anal Min,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7096866/,396

14985,Human milk banks: a need for further evidence and guidance,2021-01-19,"BACKGROUND: Currently, the identification of infectious disease re-emergence is performed without describing specific quantitative criteria that can be used to identify re-emergence events consistently. This practice may lead to ineffective mitigation. In addition, identification of factors contributing to local disease re-emergence and assessment of global disease re-emergence require access to data about disease incidence and a large number of factors at the local level for the entire world. This paper presents Re-emerging Disease Alert (RED Alert), a web-based tool designed to help public health officials detect and understand infectious disease re-emergence. OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to bring together a variety of disease-related data and analytics needed to help public health analysts answer the following 3 primary questions for detecting and understanding disease re-emergence: Is there a potential disease re-emergence at the local (country) level? What are the potential contributing factors for this re-emergence? Is there a potential for global re-emergence? METHODS: We collected and cleaned disease-related data (eg, case counts, vaccination rates, and indicators related to disease transmission) from several data sources including the World Health Organization (WHO), Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), World Bank, and Gideon. We combined these data with machine learning and visual analytics into a tool called RED Alert to detect re-emergence for the following 4 diseases: measles, cholera, dengue, and yellow fever. We evaluated the performance of the machine learning models for re-emergence detection and reviewed the output of the tool through a number of case studies. RESULTS: Our supervised learning models were able to identify 82%-90% of the local re-emergence events, although with 18%-31% (except 46% for dengue) false positives. This is consistent with our goal of identifying all possible re-emergences while allowing some false positives. The review of the web-based tool through case studies showed that local re-emergence detection was possible and that the tool provided actionable information about potential factors contributing to the local disease re-emergence and trends in global disease re-emergence. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first tool that focuses specifically on disease re-emergence and addresses the important challenges mentioned above.","Parikh, Nidhi; Daughton, Ashlynn R; Rosenberger, William Earl; Aberle, Derek Jacob; Chitanvis, Maneesha Elizabeth; Altherr, Forest Michael; Velappan, Nileena; Fairchild, Geoffrey; Deshpande, Alina",JMIR Public Health Surveill,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7819778/,396
15887,Public health round-up,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Violence against doctors in China is a serious problem that has attracted attention from both domestic and international media. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates readers’ responses to media reports on violence against doctors to identify attitudes toward perpetrators and physicians and examine if such trends are influenced by national policies. METHODS: We searched 17 Chinese violence against doctors reports in international media sources from 2011 to 2020. We then tracked back the original reports and web crawled the 19,220 comments in China. To ascertain the possible turning point of public opinion, we searched violence against doctors–related policies from Tsinghua University ipolicy database from 2011 to 2020, and found 19 policies enacted by the Chinese central government aimed at alleviating the intense patient–physician relationship. We then conducted a series of interrupted time series analyses to examine the influence of these policies on public sentiment toward violence against doctors over time. RESULTS: The interrupted time series analysis (ITSA) showed that the change in public sentiment toward violence against doctors reports was temporally associated with government interventions. The declarations of 10 of the public policies were followed by increases in the proportion of online public opinion in support of doctors (average slope changes of 0.010, P<.05). A decline in the proportion of online public opinion that blamed doctors (average level change of –0.784, P<.05) followed the declaration of 3 policies. CONCLUSIONS: The government’s administrative interventions effectively shaped public opinion but only temporarily. Continued public policy interventions are needed to sustain the reduction of hostility toward medical doctors.","Yang, Qian; Tai-Seale, Ming; Liu, Stephanie; Shen, Yi; Zhang, Xiaobin; Xiao, Xiaohua; Zhang, Kejun",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7925148/,396
17184,Public health round-up,2021-05-01,"BACKGROUND: Voice-controlled intelligent personal assistants (VIPAs), such as Amazon Echo and Google Home, involve artificial intelligence–powered algorithms designed to simulate humans. Their hands-free interface and growing capabilities have a wide range of applications in health care, covering off-clinic education, health monitoring, and communication. However, conflicting factors, such as patient safety and privacy concerns, make it difficult to foresee the further development of VIPAs in health care. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a plausible scenario for the further development of VIPAs in health care to support decision making regarding the procurement of VIPAs in health care organizations. METHODS: We conducted a two-stage Delphi study with an internationally recruited panel consisting of voice assistant experts, medical professionals, and representatives of academia, governmental health authorities, and nonprofit health associations having expertise with voice technology. Twenty projections were formulated and evaluated by the panelists. Descriptive statistics were used to derive the desired scenario. RESULTS: The panelists expect VIPAs to be able to provide solid medical advice based on patients’ personal health information and to have human-like conversations. However, in the short term, voice assistants might neither provide frustration-free user experience nor outperform or replace humans in health care. With a high level of consensus, the experts agreed with the potential of VIPAs to support elderly people and be widely used as anamnesis, informational, self-therapy, and communication tools by patients and health care professionals. Although users’ and governments’ privacy concerns are not expected to decrease in the near future, the panelists believe that strict regulations capable of preventing VIPAs from providing medical help services will not be imposed. CONCLUSIONS: According to the surveyed experts, VIPAs will show notable technological development and gain more user trust in the near future, resulting in widespread application in health care. However, voice assistants are expected to solely support health care professionals in their daily operations and will not be able to outperform or replace medical staff.","Ermolina, Alena; Tiberius, Victor",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8065565/,396

22296,Public health round-up,2015-04-01,"Smart homes promise to improve the quality of life of residents. However, they collect vasts amounts of personal and sensitive data, making privacy protection critically important. We propose a framework, called PRASH, for modeling and analyzing the privacy risks of smart homes. It is composed of three modules: a system model, a threat model, and a set of privacy metrics, which together are used for calculating the privacy risk exposure of a smart home system. By representing a smart home through a formal specification, PRASH allows for early identification of threats, better planning for risk management scenarios, and mitigation of potential impacts caused by attacks before they compromise the lives of residents. To demonstrate the capabilities of PRASH, an executable version of the smart home system configuration was generated using the proposed formal specification, which was then analyzed to find potential attack paths while also mitigating the impacts of those attacks. Thereby, we add important contributions to the body of knowledge on the mitigations of threat agents violating the privacy of users in their homes. Overall, the use of PRASH will help residents to preserve their right to privacy in the face of the emerging challenges affecting smart homes.","Bugeja, Joseph; Jacobsson, Andreas; Davidsson, Paul",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8512241/,396
22297,Public health round-up,2015-06-01,"A novel nanomaterial, bacterial cellulose (BC), has become noteworthy recently due to its better physicochemical properties and biodegradability, which are desirable for various applications. Since cost is a significant limitation in the production of cellulose, current efforts are focused on the use of industrial waste as a cost-effective substrate for the synthesis of BC or microbial cellulose. The utilization of industrial wastes and byproduct streams as fermentation media could improve the cost-competitiveness of BC production. This paper examines the feasibility of using typical wastes generated by industry sectors as sources of nutrients (carbon and nitrogen) for the commercial-scale production of BC. Numerous preliminary findings in the literature data have revealed the potential to yield a high concentration of BC from various industrial wastes. These findings indicated the need to optimize culture conditions, aiming for improved large-scale production of BC from waste streams.","Kadier, Abudukeremu; Ilyas, R. A.; Huzaifah, M. R.

22302,Public health round-up,2015-07-01,"This study reports the feasible use of chitosan as a thin film biosensor on the very sensitive quartz crystal micro balance system for detection of blends of multiple templates within a single matrix. The development of chitosan-based thin film materials with selectivity for nicotine derivatives is described. The molecular imprinting of a combination of nicotine derivatives in N-diacryloyl pipiradine-chitosan-methacrylic acid copolymer films on quartz crystal resonators was used to generate thin films with selectivity for nicotine and a range of nicotine analogues, particularly 3-phenylpyridine. The polymers were characterized by spectroscopic and microscopic evaluations; surface area, pore size, pore volume using Breuner-Emmet-Teller method. Temperature characteristics were also studied. The swelling and structure consistency of the Chitosan was achieved by grafting with methylmethacrylic acid and cross-linking with N-diacrylol pipiradine. A blend of 0.002 g (0.04 mmol) of Chitosan, 8.5 μL Methylmethacrylic Acid and 1.0 mg N-diacrylol pipradine (BAP) presented the best blend formulation. Detections were made within a time interval of 99 s, and blend templates were detected at a concentration of 0.5 mM from the Quartz crystal microbalance resonator analysis. The successful crosslinking of the biopolymers ensured successful control of the swelling and agglomeration of the chitosan, giving it the utility potential for use as thin film sensor. This successful crosslinking also created successful dual multiple templating on the chitosan matrix, even for aerosolized templates. The products can be used in environments with temperature ranges between 60 °C and 250 °C.","Ofoegbu, Obinna; Ike, David Chukwuebuka; Batiha, Gaber El-Saber; Fouad, Hassan; Srichana, Roongnapa S.; Nicholls, Ian",Polymers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8512477/,396
37373,Public health round-up,2020-07-01,"[Image: see text] Drastic changes in electricity demand have been observed since March 2020 in Europe, after several countries implemented lockdown-like measures to contain the spread of COVID-19. We investigate the sensitivity of the electricity–water nexus in the European electric grid to large-scale behavior changes during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown-like measures. We quantify changes in the blue virtual water trade between five European countries heavily affected by COVID-19 during the same period. As a result, the consumptive water footprint of thermal power plant operations in Europe decreased by 1.77 × 10(6) m(3)/day during the COVID-19 lockdowns, compared to the average of the past four years. Reduced electricity demand accounts for 16% (0.29 × 10(6) m(3)/day) of the decrease, while the remainder is attributable to changes in the electricity generation mix toward less water-intensive technologies before 2020 and during lockdowns. Virtual water transfers associated with electricity were also affected: Italy, a hotspot of COVID-19, reduced its water footprint by 8.4% and its virtual water imports by 70,700 m(3)/day. Germany and France slightly reduced their domestic water footprint of electricity but increased their virtual water imports. These findings improve our understanding of the impacts of large-scale behavior and technological changes to the European electricity–water nexus.","Roidt, Mario; Chini, Christopher M.; Stillwell, Ashlynn S.; Cominola, Andrea",Environ Sci Technol Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7380128/,396

OBJECTIVE To investigate the accuracy of K+ supplementation in isotonic crystalloid fluids. ANIMALS None. METHODS Observational study. 210 bags of fluid supplemented with KCl being administered to hospitalized dogs and cats intravenously (IV) were sampled over a 3-month period. Measured K+ concentration ([K+]) was compared to the intended [K+] of the bag. In a second experiment, 60 stock fluid bags were supplemented to achieve a concentration of 20 mmol/L K+, mixed well and [K+] was measured. In another 12 bags of 0.9% NaCl, K+ was added without mixing the bag, and [K+ ] of the delivered fluid was measured at regular time points during constant rate infusion. RESULTS The measured [K+] was significantly higher than intended [K+] (mean difference 9.0 mmol/L, range 6.5 to >280 mmol/L, P < .0001). In 28% of clinical samples measured [K+] was ≥5 mmol/L different than intended [K+]. With adequate mixing, K+ supplementation of fluids can be accurate with the mean difference between measured and intended [K+] of 0.7 (95% CI -0.32 to 1.7) mmol/L. When not mixed, K(+) supplementation of 20 mmol/L can lead to very high [K+] of delivered fluid (up to 1410 mmol/L).

137581,The global proliferation of high-containment biological laboratories: understanding the phenomenon and its implications.,2018,"MOTIVATION Modelling microbiome systems as complex networks is known as the problem of network inference. Microbial association network inference is of great significance in applications on clinical diagnosis, disease treatment, pathological analysis, etc. However, most current network inference methods focus on mining strong pairwise associations between microorganisms, which is defective in reflecting the comprehensive interactive patterns participated by multiple microorganisms. It is also possible that the microorganisms involved in the generated network are not dominant in the microbiome due to the mere focus on the strength of pairwise associations. Some scholars tried to mine comprehensive microbial associations by association rule mining methods, but the adopted algorithms are relatively basic and have severe limitations such as low calculation efficiency, lacking the ability of mining negative correlations and high redundancy in results, making it difficult to mine high-quality microbial association rules and accurately infer microbial association networks. RESULTS We proposed a microbial association network inference method ""MANIEA"" based on the improved Eclat algorithm for mining positive and negative microbial association rules. We also proposed a new method for transforming association rules into microbial association networks, which can effectively demonstrate the co-occurrence and causal correlations in association rules. An experiment was conducted on three authentic microbial abundance datasets to compare the ""MANIEA"" with currently popular network inference methods, which demonstrated that the proposed ""MANIEA"" show advantages in aspects of correlation forms, computation efficiency, adjustability, and network characteristics.

186720,Management protocols for animals in captive propagation and reintroduction programmes.,1996,"The nucleolus is a distinct subnuclear compartment that was first observed more than 200 years ago. Nucleoli assemble around the tandemly repeated ribosomal DNA gene clusters and 28S, 18S and 5.8S ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) are transcribed as a single precursor, which is processed and assembled with the 5S rRNA into ribosome subunits. Although the nucleolus is primarily associated with ribosome biogenesis, several lines of evidence now show that it has additional functions. Some of these functions, such as regulation of mitosis, cell-cycle progression and proliferation, many forms of stress response and biogenesis of multiple ribonucleoprotein particles, will be discussed, as will the relation of the nucleolus to human diseases.","Boisvert, François-Michel; van Koningsbruggen, Silvana; Navascués, Joaquín; Lamond, Angus I",Nature reviews.

Fourteen dogs, three mixed breed and 11 Ibizian hounds, living in an area of Spain that was highly endemic for leishmaniasis were followed-up over a three-year period by serologic analysis and the leishmanin skin test (LST). All but one of these dogs remained clinically healthy during the study period. Seroconversion was observed in four dogs. The three mixed breed dogs had a negative reaction in the LST in the first and third years. The general trend in the Ibizian hounds was an increase in the diameter of the LST reaction at both the 48- and 72-hour readings in the third year. This study demonstrates that in addition to an increase in Leishmania-specific humoral immune response in Ibizian hounds, a parallel increase in cellular immune response was observed.","Solano-Gallego, Laia; Llull, Joan; Ramis, Antonio; Fernández-Bellon, Hugo; Rodríguez, Alhelí; Ferrer, Lluís; Alberola, Jordi",The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15964969/,396
188469,A history of One Health.,2014,"Epidemiological studies have linked the inhalation of airborne particulate matter (PM) to increased morbidity and mortality in humans. However, the mechanisms of toxicity of these particles remain unclear. Some hypotheses state that the toxicity might stem from PM transition metal content, adhered organic compounds, the biological component, or ultrafine particle content. In order to analyze metal involvement in PM toxicity, human airway epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B) cultures were exposed for 24 h to an aqueous extract of PM collected in the Utah Valley. A portion of the extract was treated with Chelex, an agent that removes cations (including transition metals) from solution. Removal of the majority of the metal mass was confirmed by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analyses. Cells that were incubated with the untreated extract (62-1000 microg dry extract equivalent) showed a significant concentration-dependent increase in the inflammatory mediator interleukin-8 (IL-8) when compared to the control cells. However, cells incubated with Chelex-treated extract produced no change (relative to control) in IL-8. We exposed rats in vivo for 24 h to the same treatments as the cells and found significant increases in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and total protein in the rats exposed to the untreated extract and to the Chelex-treated extract with metals added back to achieve original concentrations. There was an attenuation of the observed LDH and total protein increases in the rats instilled with the Chelex-treated extract. Taken together, our results suggest that removal of metal cations attenuates cellular responses to the aqueous extract and support a role for transition metal involvement in PM-associated increases in morbidity and mortality.","Molinelli, Alejandro R; Madden, Michael C; McGee, John K; Stonehuerner, Jacqueline G; Ghio, Andrew J",Inhalation toxicology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12396411/,396
190355,Recent applications of biotechnology to novel diagnostics for aquatic animals.,2008,"The epidemics of Ebola virus in West Africa and Zika virus in America highlight how viruses can explosively emerge into new territories. These epidemics also exposed how unprepared we are to handle infectious disease emergencies. This is also true when we consider hypothesized new clinical features of infection, such as the associations between Zika virus infection and severe neurological disease, including microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome. On the surface, these pathologies appear to be new features of Zika virus infection, however, causal relationships have not yet been established. Decades of limited Zika virus research are making us scramble to determine the true drivers behind the epidemic, often at the expense of over-speculation without credible evidence. Here we review the literature and find no conclusive evidence at this time for significant biological differences between the American Zika virus strains and those circulating elsewhere. Rather, the epidemic scale in the Americas may be facilitated by an abnormally warm climate, dense human and mosquito populations, and previous exposure to other viruses. Severe disease associated with Zika virus may therefore not be a new trait for the virus, rather it may have been overlooked due to previously small outbreaks. Much of the recent panic regarding Zika virus has been about the Olympics in Brazil. We do not find any substantial evidence that the Olympics will result in a significant number of new Zika virus infections (~10 predicted) or that the Olympics will promote further epidemic spread over what is already expected. The Zika virus epidemic in the Americas is a serious situation and decisions based on solid scientific evidence - not hyped media speculations - are required for effective outbreak response.","Grubaugh, Nathan D; Andersen, Kristian G",F1000Research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27746903/,396

The pathological analysis of 235 actively demyelinating lesions coming from three centers revealed different structural and immunological features suggesting that different pathogenetic mechanisms are involved in lesion formation. On the basis of the presence or absence of immunoglobulin and complement deposition, myelin protein loss and the patterns of oligodendrocyte degeneration beside a T cell- and macrophage-dominated immune response, four distinct patterns of demyelination have been identified. In this short review, possible paraclinical markers for tissue destruction on the basis of the main features of myelin destruction are discussed. Furthermore, the importance of early axonal damage in multiple sclerosis is highlighted.","Kornek, Barbara; Lassmann, Hans",Brain research bulletin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12909302/,396

190873,"Essential veterinary education in the cultural, political and biological complexities of international trade in animals and animal products.",2009,"BACKGROUND Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is a recently identified homologue of ACE that may counterregulate the actions of angiotensin (Ang) II by facilitating its breakdown to Ang 1-7. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cirrhosis but the role of ACE2 in liver disease is not known. AIMS This study examined the effects of liver injury on ACE2 expression and activity in experimental hepatic fibrosis and human cirrhosis, and the effects of Ang 1-7 on vascular tone in cirrhotic rat aorta. METHODS In sham operated and bile duct ligated (BDL) rats, quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to assess hepatic ACE2 mRNA, and western blotting and immunohistochemistry to quantify and localise ACE2 protein. ACE2 activity was quantified by quenched fluorescent substrate assay. Similar studies were performed in normal human liver and in hepatitis C cirrhosis. RESULTS ACE2 mRNA was detectable at low levels in rat liver and increased following BDL (363-fold; p < 0.01). ACE2 protein increased after BDL (23.5-fold; p < 0.05) as did ACE2 activity (fourfold; p < 0.05). In human cirrhotic liver, gene (>30-fold), protein expression (97-fold), and activity of ACE2 (2.4 fold) were increased compared with controls (all p < 0.01). In healthy livers, ACE2 was confined to endothelial cells, occasional bile ducts, and perivenular hepatocytes but in both BDL and human cirrhosis there was widespread parenchymal expression of ACE2 protein. Exposure of cultured human hepatocytes to hypoxia led to increased ACE2 expression. In preconstricted rat aorta, Ang 1-7 alone did not affect vascular tone but it significantly enhanced acetylcholine mediated vasodilatation in cirrhotic vessels. CONCLUSIONS ACE2 expression is significantly increased in liver injury in both humans and rat, possibly in response to increasing hepatocellular hypoxia, and may modulate RAS activity in cirrhosis.","Paizis, G; Tikellis, C; Cooper, M E; Schembri, J M; Lew, R A; Smith, A I; Shaw, T; Warner, F J; Zuilli, A; Burrell, L M; Angus, P W",Gut,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16166274/,396
191260,Pestivirus infections in ruminants in Norway.,1992,"The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus produces the disease called COVID-19, currently spreading in a rapidly evolving pandemic. It can be transmitted by contact, drops and aerosols, and has been isolated from gastrointestinal secretions and faeces. During digestive endoscopy, transmission by any of these mechanisms could occur. It is recommended to limit digestive endoscopy to cases of digestive bleeding, severe dysphagia, foreign body in the digestive tract, biliary obstruction with intractable pain or cholangitis, pseudocyst or complicated encapsulated pancreatic necrosis, gastrointestinal obstruction, and cases at risk of deterioration over time. It is recommended to screen patients based on temperature, symptoms, and epidemiological factors to classify them according to their risk of infection. For procedures in low risk patients, personnel must wear a disposable gown, gloves, eye or face shield, standard surgical mask, disposable hat, disposable shoe covers. In cases of intermediate or high risk, or confirmed COVID-19, protection should be increased using disposable waterproof gown, N95 respirator or similar, and double glove. In case of shortage it may be necessary to reuse N95 respirators for up to 5 uses, following CDC recommendations for donning, removing and storing to prevent secondary contact contamination. Likewise, all protective equipment should be put on and removed according to CDC recommendations. The presence of personnel in endoscopy should be limited to the bare minimum. Said personnel must have daily temperature control and if it is above 37.3ºC, the corresponding evaluation must be carried out. After each procedure, the stretcher and room surfaces should be properly disinfected. High-level disinfection of endoscopes eliminates SARS-CoV-2.","Prochazka Zá Rate, Ricardo Arturo; Cabrera Cabrejos, María Cecilia; Piscoya, Alejandro; Vera Calderón, Augusto Francisco",Revista de gastroenterologia del Peru : organo oficial de la Sociedad de Gastroenterologia del Peru,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32369475/,396
191503,Modes of action of disinfectants.,1995,"This study examines the connections between familiar (influenza) and unfamiliar (SARS) risks among the general public in a SARS affected society. Using a survey of 350 respondents in Chonju, we find that risk perceptions and a belief that influenza vaccination reduces the incidence of SARS explain behavioral intentions for influenza vaccination and purchase responses to a hypothetical SARS vaccine. Those respondents who believe that an influenza vaccination will very likely reduce SARS incidence have a high probability (79%) of intending to vaccinate, but a much lower WTP for a SARS vaccine than those without such a belief. This belief undoubtedly was influenced by a reframing of influenza vaccination as preventing SARS. Such reframing may lead to short-term improvements in vaccination rates to the detriment of long-term SARS vaccination development. When compared with a similar study in Taiwan, societal risk perceptions of SARS and WTP for a vaccine vary greatly according to the extent of a society's experience with SARS.","Hong, Seonghoon; Collins, Alan",Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17054529/,396

192637,Tools from the new institutional economics for reforming the delivery of veterinary services.,2004,"AIM This study was to carry out exome sequencing in a Han Chinese family with venous thromboembolism. METHODS Three venous thromboembolism (VTE) patients and five members from a Han Chinese family were evaluated by exome sequencing. RESULTS Among the 3 VTE patients, mutations of 2 genes including PRF1 and HTR2A were identified and predicted to be functionally damaged to their encoded proteins. In addition, the PRF1 mutation and the HTR2A mutation identified in our study were absent in 100 non-related controls, indicating that venous thromboembolism has a genetic component. The R357W mutation is located in the membrane attack complex/perforin domain of PRF1 protein, which exists in both the perforin. The steps of killing foreign or pathological antigen cells by NK cells, CD8 (+)T cells and the membrane attack complex include membrane perforation and release of the granzyme, either of which is abnormal can lead to immune dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS The mutations of immune related genes in familial VTE might provide new understanding of the pathogenesis of familial venous thromboembolism.","Duan, Qianglin; Lv, Wei; Yang, Minjun; Yang, Fan; Zhu, Yongqiang; Kang, Hui; Song, Haoming; Wang, Shengyue; Dong, Hui; Wang, Lemin",International journal of clinical and experimental medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26221353/,396
192646,Microbial adaptation and change: avian influenza.,2004,"BACKGROUND Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are a common reason for consulting general practitioners (GPs). In most cases the aetiology is unknown, yet most result in an antibiotic prescription. The aetiology of LRTI was investigated in a prospective controlled study. METHODS Eighty adults presenting to GPs with acute LRTI were recruited together with 49 controls over 12 months. Throat swabs, nasal aspirates (patients and controls), and sputum (patients) were obtained and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays were used to detect Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, influenza viruses (AH1, AH3 and B), parainfluenza viruses 1-3, coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, and enteroviruses. Standard sputum bacteriology was also performed. Outcome was recorded at a follow up visit. RESULTS Potential pathogens were identified in 55 patients with LRTI (69%) and seven controls (14%; p<0.0001). The identification rate was 63% (viruses) and 26% (bacteria) for patients and 12% (p<0.0001) and 6% (p = 0.013), respectively, for controls. The most common organisms identified in the patients were rhinoviruses (33%), influenza viruses (24%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (19%) compared with 2% (p<0.001), 6% (p = 0.013), and 4% (p = 0.034), respectively, in controls. Multiple pathogens were identified in 18 of the 80 LRTI patients (22.5%) and in two of the 49 controls (4%; p = 0.011). Atypical organisms were rarely identified. Cases with bacterial aetiology were clinically indistinguishable from those with viral aetiology. CONCLUSION Patients presenting to GPs with acute adult LRTI predominantly have a viral illness which is most commonly caused by rhinoviruses and influenza viruses.","Creer, D D; Dilworth, J P; Gillespie, S H; Johnston, A R; Johnston, S L; Ling, C; Patel, S; Sanderson, G; Wallace, P G; McHugh, T D",Thorax,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16227331/,396

One area of particular concern for respiratory therapists is the charting of mechanical ventilator settings. Our profession's lack of a standardized and generally accepted taxonomy for mechanical ventilation leaves us with a confusing array of terms related to ventilator settings. Such confusion makes database design impossible for information technology professionals and is a risk-management concern for clinicians. Of particular note is the complexity related to set airway pressures when using modes whose primary control variable is pressure (versus volume).

197908,Making better use of technological advances to meet stakeholder needs.,2006,"BACKGROUND Rhinovirus is a recognized cause of common cold, proven to cause asthma exacerbations in children. In Spain, no description exists, as yet, as to the degree of burden rhinovirus infections represent among hospitalized infants. Our aim was to describe rhinovirus infections in hospitalized children, under 2 years of age, and to compare these with patients infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). PATIENTS AND METHODS The prospective study was performed between September 2003 and July 2005, in children <2 years of age, admitted at the Severo Ochoa Hospital (Leganés, Madrid) with fever or respiratory tract infection and with positive rhinovirus detection in the nasopharyngeal aspirate samples. Virologic diagnosis was made by multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and for some virus by direct immunofluorescent assay in nasopharyngeal samples. Demographic and clinical data of those patients with rhinovirus infection were described and compared with a group of 86 patients, infected only with RSV, randomly selected from the same population. RESULTS We detected 85 children admitted to hospital with rhinovirus infection. Rhinovirus was the cause of 25% of all admissions, among the total of 340 under 2-year olds diagnosed with fever or respiratory tract infection. Rhinovirus was the second viral agent identified, after RSV. Clinical diagnosis was recurrent wheezing in 48.2%; bronchiolitis in 36.5%; and pneumonia in 3.5%. Fever was present in 60% of the patients. Radiologic infiltrates were found in 22.4% of the children. In 50.6% of the infants, oxygen saturation under 95% was detected, at the time of admission. Hypoxia was present in RSV-infected children more frequently (P = 0.005). Also, in this group, final diagnosis was, most frequently, bronchiolitis (P = 0.0001), and rhinovirus-infected patients were most frequently males (P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS Rhinovirus was detected in hospitalized infants with respiratory tract disease and was the second most common virus after RSV. In our experience, it was the second etiologic agent associated with recurrent wheezing in hospitalized children, under the age of 2 years.","Calvo, Cristina; García-García, Maria Luz; Blanco, Carolina; Pozo, Francisco; Flecha, Inmaculada Casas; Pérez-Breña, Pilar",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17901795/,396

Clinical treatment for COVID-19 remains primarily supportive with no specific medicines or regimens. Here, the development of multifunctional alveolar macrophage (AM)-like nanoparticles (NPs) with photothermal inactivation capability for COVID-19 treatment is reported. The NPs, made by wrapping polymeric cores with AM membranes, display the same surface receptors as AMs, including the coronavirus receptor and multiple cytokine receptors. By acting as AM decoys, the NPs block coronavirus from host cell entry and absorb various proinflammatory cytokines, thus achieving combined antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatment. To enhance the antiviral efficiency, an efficient photothermal material based on aggregation-induced emission luminogens is doped into the NPs for virus photothermal disruption under near-infrared (NIR) irradiation. In a surrogate mouse model of COVID-19 caused by murine coronavirus, treatment with multifunctional AM-like NPs with NIR irradiation decreases virus burden and cytokine levels, reduces lung damage and inflammation, and confers a significant survival advantage to the infected mice. Crucially, this therapeutic strategy may be clinically applied for the treatment of COVID-19 at early stage through atomization inhalation of the NPs followed by NIR irradiation of the respiratory tract, thus alleviating infection progression and reducing transmission risk.","Li, B.; Wang, W.; Song, W.

We explore details on contextual bandits, an extension to the traditional reinforcement learning (RL) problem and build a novel algorithm to solve this problem using an array of action-based learners. We apply this approach to model an article recommendation system using an array of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) learners to make predictions on rewards based on actions taken. We then extend the approach to a publicly available MovieLens dataset and explore the findings. First, we make available a simplified simulated dataset showing varying user preferences over time and how this can be evaluated with static and dynamic learning algorithms. This dataset made available as part of this research is intentionally simulated with limited number of features and can be used to evaluate different problem-solving strategies. We will build a classifier using static dataset and evaluate its performance on this dataset. We show limitations of static learner due to fixed context at a point of time and how changing that context brings down the accuracy. Next we develop a novel algorithm for solving the contextual bandit problem. Similar to the linear bandits, this algorithm maps the reward as a function of context vector but uses an array of learners to capture variation between actions/arms.

416395,Public health round-up,2021,"Self-reported depression has been observed in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients, infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), during discharge from the hospital. However, the cause of this self-reported depression during the convalescent period remains unclear. Here, we report the mental health status of 96 convalescent COVID-19 patients who were surveyed using an online questionnaire at the Shenzhen Samii Medical Center from March 2 to March 12, 2020 in Shenzhen, China. After obtaining their informed consent, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics of patients, including routine blood and biochemical data. The results suggested that patients with self-reported depression exhibited increased immune response, as indicated by increased white blood cell and neutrophil counts, as well as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. However, the mechanism linking self-reported depression to these cellular changes needs further study. In conclusion, self-reported depression occurred at an early stage in convalescent COVID-19 patients, and changes in immune function were apparent during short-term follow-up of these patients after discharge. Appropriate psychological interventions are necessary, and changes in immune function should be emphasized during long-term follow up of these patients.","Yuan, Bo; Li, Weixin; Liu, Hanqing; Cai, Xin; Song, Shuo; Zhao, Jia; Hu, Xiaopeng; Li, Zhiwen; Chen, Yongxin; Zhang, Kai; Liu, Zhiyong; Peng, Jing; Wang, Cheng; Wang, Jianchun; An, Yawen",Brain Behav Immun,,396

We test three hypotheses: [H1] Asians in the US are more likely to report experiencing coronavirus stigmatization than non-Hispanic Whites; [H2] Coronavirus stigmatization is associated with psychological distress; [H3] Magnitude of association between coronavirus stigmatization and psychological distress is more pronounced among US-born Asians, compared to non-Hispanic Whites. DESIGN: We analyzed cross-sectional survey data from the 10-31 March 2020 wave of the Understanding America Survey, a nationally representative survey of adults in the US. Psychological distress was assessed with the PHQ-4. Measures of association were estimated using multiple logistic regression and survey sampling weights. Predicted probabilities were calculated using marginal standardization ( n = 6707). RESULTS: [H1] The adjusted predicted probability of experiencing any coronavirus stigma among foreign-born Asians (11.2%, 95% CI: 5.5-17.0%; E-value = 4.52), US-born Asians (10.9%, 95% CI: 5.8-16.0%; E-value = 4.23), Blacks (8.0%, 95% CI: 5.3-10.7%; E-value = 2.92), and Hispanic Whites (7.3%, 95% CI: 4.6-9.9%; E-value = 2.58) was significantly greater than non-Hispanic Whites (4.5%, 95% CI: 3.7-5.4%). [H2] Individuals reporting any coronavirus stigma experience were significantly more likely to exhibit psychological distress (19.9%, 95% CI: 14.6-25.2% vs 10.6%, 9.6-11.6%; E-value = 3.16). [H3] The overall magnitude of association between experience of any coronavirus stigma and psychological distress was not significantly between US-born Asians and non-Hispanic Whites, though we found gender to mask this effect. US-born Asian females who experienced coronavirus stigmatization were more likely to exhibit psychological distress than non-Hispanic white females who experienced coronavirus stigmatization (relative risk (RR): 10.21, 95% CI: 2.69-38.74 vs 1.24, 95% CI: 0.76-2.01; p < 0.01).

606410,"Global disparities in breast cancer outcomes: new perspectives, widening inequities, unanswered questions",2020-07-22,"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2, represents an unprecedented challenge for healthcare. COVID-19 features a state of hyperinflammation resulting in a “cytokine storm”, which leads to severe complications, such as the development of micro-thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Despite isolation measures, the number of affected patients is growing daily: as of June 12th, over 7.5 million cases have been confirmed worldwide, with more than 420,000 global deaths. Over 3.5 million patients have recovered from COVID-19; although this number is increasing by the day, great attention should be directed towards the possible long-term outcomes of the disease. Despite being a trivial matter for patients in intensive care units (ICUs), erectile dysfunction (ED) is a likely consequence of COVID-19 for survivors, and considering the high transmissibility of the infection and the higher contagion rates among elderly men, a worrying phenomenon for a large part of affected patients. METHODS: A literature research on the possible mechanisms involved in the development of ED in COVID-19 survivors was performed. RESULTS: Endothelial dysfunction, subclinical hypogonadism, psychological distress and impaired pulmonary hemodynamics all contribute to the potential onset of ED. Additionally, COVID-19 might exacerbate cardiovascular conditions; therefore, further increasing the risk of ED. Testicular function in COVID-19 patients requires careful investigation for the unclear association with testosterone deficiency and the possible consequences for reproductive health. Treatment with phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors might be beneficial for both COVID-19 and ED. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 survivors might develop sexual and reproductive health issues. Andrological assessment and tailored treatments should be considered in the follow-up.","Sansone, A.; Mollaioli, D.; Ciocca, G.; Limoncin, E.; Colonnello, E.; Vena, W.; Jannini, E.

618754,Public health round-up,2020-04-01,"Psychological resilience is considered to constitute an important factor for protecting mental health, especially during times of crises, like the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. However, there is a lack of research on the potential buffering effect of resilience on the psychological impact of COVID-19 as related to mental health. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to examine protective effects of resilience on mental health during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Austria. Analysis was based on data collected from 4,113 Austrian residents, who participated in an anonymous online survey. The survey addressed sociodemographic data, the subjective response to COVID-19 (Impact of Event Scale; IES-R), mental health status (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale; DASS-21), and resilience (Resilience-Scale; RS-11). Structural equation modelling showed significant positive associations between the IES-R score and depressive symptoms, stress and anxiety, respectively. Resilience was significantly negatively associated with depression, stress, and anxiety. Furthermore, resilience moderated the relation between the impact of COVID-19 and anxiety symptoms. However, there was no moderating effect of resilience on the relationship between IES-R and both depression and stress. The psychological impact of COVID-19 on anxiety symptoms seems to vary with the level of resilience. Moderating effects of resilience on the relation between impact of COVID-19 and stress and depression symptoms could not be confirmed. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term effects of resilience on stress and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Traunmüller, Claudia; Stefitz, Rene; Schneider, Martha; Schwerdtfeger, Andreas",Psychol Health Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34319171/; https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2021.1955137,396

The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of the SARS outbreak on hospitalization for chronic ambulatory-care-sensitive conditions (ACSCs) in Taiwan. Methods We applied a population-based interrupted time series study design and used the time series auto-regressive integrated moving-average model to compare the actual and predicted admission rates of seven selected chronic ACSCs. The analyses were based on National Health Insurance hospital inpatient claims data from 1997 to 2003. Results The impact of SARS on ACSCs after the outbreak varied among seven selected chronic conditions. Hospitalization for respiratory conditions was significantly lower than the predicted values, whereas hospitalization for diabetes was significantly higher than the predicted values after the outbreak. Conclusion Admission rates for most ACSCs, except for diabetes, did not change in the post-SARS period. The reductions in outpatient utilization during the SARS outbreak did not appear to affect adversely admissions for most ACSCs.","Huang, Yu-Tung; Lee, Yue-Chune; Hsiao, Chun-Ju",Journal of the Formosan Medical Association,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929664609600826; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0929-6646(09)60082-6; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0929664609600826; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19443292/,396
636597,Public health round-up,2020-05-01,"Canine coronavirus (CCoV) is an enveloped RNA virus, responsible for gastrointestinal infection in dogs. To date, two different CCoV genotypes have been recognized, CCoV type I and CCoV type II. Recently, CCoV type II strains of potential recombinant origin with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) were detected and characterized as a new subtype (CCoV-IIb) of canine coronavirus, in order to be differentiated from the “classical” CCoV type II strains (CCoV-IIa). In the present study, two CCoV-IIb strains were detected in the faeces and internal organs of two puppies, which died after presenting gastrointestinal symptoms. Mixed infection of both subtypes (CCoV-IIa/IIb) was detected in the faeces, while only CCoV-IIb was detected in the organs. Puppies were also infected by canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2). Both CCoV-IIb strains were isolated on cell cultures and subjected to sequence analysis and phylogeny. By means of RT-PCR and real time RT-PCR assays, tissue distribution and quantitation of viral loads took place. These cases represent the first description of tissue distribution and quantitation of CCoV-IIb strains, detected in the organs. The detection of CCoV-IIa strains, which is restricted to the faeces, suggests that CCoV-IIb strains may have an advantage in disseminating throughout a dog with CPV-2 coinfection, in contrast to common enteric CCoV-IIa strains.","Ntafis, V.; Mari, V.; Decaro, N.; Papanastassopoulou, M.; Papaioannou, N.; Mpatziou, R.; Buonavoglia, C.; Xylouri, E.",Vet Microbiol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113511001465; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2011.03.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21481551/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113511001465,396
645297,Public health round-up,2021-09-01,"BACKGROUND: To date, no recommendations have been published on when and how to start again carrying out elective, non-urgent surgery on COVID-19-negative patients after the epidemic peak has been reached in a given country or region and the pressure on healthcare facilities, healthcare workers and resources has been released by so far that elective surgery procedures can be safely and ethically programmed again. This study aims to investigate whether elective orthopaedic surgery will increase the risk of developing COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a combined retrospective and prospective studies performed at a national tertiary hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia. Subjects were patients who underwent elective orthopaedic surgeries at our institution from April to May 2020. Those who were previously infected with COVID-19 from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reverse transcriptase (RT) examination obtained via nasopharynx and oropharynx swab, as well as those who were reluctant to participate were excluded from the study. RESULTS: A total of 35 subjects (mean age 32.89 ± 17.42) were recruited. Fifteen (42.9%) subjects were male, and 20 subjects (57.1%) were female. Mean duration of surgery was 240 min with the longest and shortest duration of 690 and 40 min, respectively. General anaesthesia was performed in the majority of cases in 18 surgeries (51.4%) with local anaesthesia as the least in 2 surgeries (5.7%). Length of stay of our study was 6 days of average. None of the patients developed symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: We found that elective orthopaedic surgery may not be associated with increased cases of COVID-19 cases. However, our study was limited by short duration of follow-up. Further studies are required in order to investigate the affect of undergoing elective surgery and the number of COVID-19 cases.","Kamal, A.F.; Widodo, W.; Kuncoro, M.W.; Karda, I.W.A.M.; Prabowo, Y.; Sigh, G.; Liastuti, L.D.; Trimartani; Hutagalung, E.U.; Saleh, I.; Tobing, S.D.A.L.; Gunawan, B.; Dilogo, I.H.; Lubis, A.M.T.; Kurniawan, A.; Rahyussalim; Oesman, I.; PPSI, N.N.; Latief, W.; Wijaya, M.T.; Ivansyah, M.D.; Primaputra, M.R.A.; Reksoprodjo, A.Y.; Hendriarto, A.; Novriandi, K.M.A.; Alaztha, Z.; Canintika, A.F.; Sitanggang, A.H.R.",Ann Med Surg (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33078074/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2020.10.015; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2049080120303691; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2049080120303691?v=s5,396
652432,Public health round-up,2020-02-01,"The transmembrane aminopeptidase CD13 is highly expressed in cells of the myeloid lineage, regulates dynamin-dependent receptor endocytosis and recycling and is a necessary component of actin cytoskeletal organization. Here, we show that CD13-deficient mice present a low bone density phenotype with increased numbers of osteoclasts per bone surface, but display a normal distribution of osteoclast progenitor populations in the bone marrow and periphery. In addition, the bone formation and mineral apposition rates are similar between genotypes, indicating a defect in osteoclast-specific function in vivo. Lack of CD13 led to exaggerated in vitro osteoclastogenesis as indicated by significantly enhanced fusion of bone marrow-derived multinucleated osteoclasts in the presence of M-CSF and RANKL, resulting in abnormally large cells containing remarkably high numbers of nuclei. Mechanistically, while expression levels of the fusion-regulatory proteins dynamin and DC-STAMP1 must be downregulated for fusion to proceed, these are aberrantly sustained at high levels even in CD13-deficient mature multi-nucleated osteoclasts. Further, the stability of fusion-promoting proteins is maintained in the absence of CD13, implicating CD13 in protein turnover mechanisms. Together, we conclude that CD13 may regulate cell–cell fusion by controlling the expression and localization of key fusion regulatory proteins that are critical for osteoclast fusion.","Ghosh, Mallika; Kelava, Tomislav; Madunic, Ivana Vrhovac; Kalajzic, Ivo; Shapiro, Linda H.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34031489/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-90271-x,396

We performed an ecological study to determine the association of state-level cases and deaths with NCD risk factors and healthcare and social indices. MethodsWe obtained cumulative national and state-level data on COVID-19 cases and deaths from publicly available database www.covid19india.org from February to end November 2020. To identify association with major NCD risk factors, NCDs, healthcare related and social variables we obtained data from public sources. Association was determined using univariate and multivariate statistics. ResultsMore than 9.5 million COVID-19 cases and 135,000 deaths have been reported in India at end November 2020. There is significant positive correlation (Pearsons r) of state-level COVID-19 cases and deaths per million, respectively, with NCD risk factors- obesity (0.64, 0.52), hypertension (0.28, 0.16), diabetes (0.66, 0.46), literacy, NCD epidemiological transition index (0.58, 0.54) and ischemic heart disease mortality (0.22, 0.33).

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Three merged data sources from a large United States health plan: a large national administrative claims database, an outpatient laboratory testing database, and an inpatient hospital admissions database. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 18-65 with continuous enrollment in the health plan from January 2019 to the date of a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Three comparator groups, matched by propensity score, to individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2: a 2020 comparator group, an historical 2019 comparator group, and an historical comparator group with viral lower respiratory tract illness. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: More than 50 clinical sequelae after the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection (defined as the date of first SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis (index date) plus 21 days) were identified using ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) codes. Excess risk in the four months after acute infection and hazard ratios with Bonferroni corrected 95% confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS: 14% of adults aged ≤65 who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (27 074 of 193 113) had at least one new type of clinical sequelae that required medical care after the acute phase of the illness, which was 4.95% higher than in the 2020 comparator group. The risk for specific new sequelae attributable to SARS-Cov-2 infection after the acute phase, including chronic respiratory failure, cardiac arrythmia, hypercoagulability, encephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy, amnesia (memory difficulty), diabetes, liver test abnormalities, myocarditis, anxiety, and fatigue, was significantly greater than in the three comparator groups (2020, 2019, and viral lower respiratory tract illness groups) (all P<0.001). Significant risk differences because of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranged from 0.02 to 2.26 per 100 people (all P<0.001), and hazard ratios ranged from 1.24 to 25.65 compared with the 2020 comparator group. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate the excess risk of developing new clinical sequelae after the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including specific types of sequelae less commonly seen in other viral illnesses. Although individuals who were older, had pre-existing conditions, and were admitted to hospital because of covid-19 were at greatest excess risk, younger adults (aged ≤50), those with no pre-existing conditions, or those not admitted to hospital for covid-19 also had an increased risk of developing new clinical sequelae. The greater risk for incident sequelae after the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection is relevant for healthcare planning.","Daugherty, Sarah E; Guo, Yinglong; Heath, Kevin; Dasmariñas, Micah C; Jubilo, Karol Giuseppe; Samranvedhya, Jirapat; Lipsitch, Marc; Cohen, Ken",BMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.n1098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34011492/,396
