62035,COVID-19: the difference between the nose and the lung.,2021-03-05,"Purpose To present an overview of the evidence of the effect of job loss prevention interventions, aiming to improve work ability and decrease absenteeism and/or job loss in persons with inflammatory arthritis (IA). Method A systematic literature search in the databases PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library was conducted. A search strategy used in a review from 2014 was copied and additional keywords were added with no time restriction. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (RoB 1) was used for quality assessment and the overall quality of each study was determined using predetermined cut-off criteria, categorising studies to be of good-, acceptable- or low quality. Results were summarised narratively. Results Six randomised controlled trials (published in seven articles) were included, one of good quality and five of acceptable quality. One study identified significant improvements in work ability, while three found no significant difference between groups. One study identified significant difference in absenteeism, while two studies identified no difference between the intervention and control groups. Two studies identified significant reduction in job loss, while two studies identified no group difference. The inconsistent results may be due to heterogeneity in interventions and outcome measures used, and the results should therefore be interpreted with caution. Conclusion The results indicate that job loss prevention interventions may have an effect on work ability, absenteeism and in particular job loss among persons with IA. Further good-quality studies regarding job loss prevention interventions for people with IA are still recommended.","Madsen, Christina Merete Tvede; Bisgaard, Sara Kjær; Primdahl, Jette; Christensen, Jeanette Reffstrup; von Bülow, Cecilie",Journal of occupational rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10926-021-09972-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33782815/,857
107117,Systemic inflammation in patients with Takotsubo syndrome: a review of mechanistic and clinical implications.,2021-03-12,"INTRODUCTION Radical cystectomy (RC) is the current mainstay for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Concerns regarding morbidity, mortality and quality of life have favored the introduction of bladder sparing strategies. Trimodal therapy, combining transurethral resection, chemotherapy and radiotherapy is the current standard of care for bladder preservation strategies in selected patients with MIBC. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION A comprehensive search of the Medline and Embase databases was performed. A total of 19 studies were included in a systematic review of bladder sparing strategies in MIBC management was carried out following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA). EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS The overall median complete response rate after trimodal therapy (TMT) was 77% (55-93). Salvage cystectomy rate with TMT was 17% on average (8-30). For TMT, the 5-year cancer-specific survival and overall survival rates range from 42-82% and 32-74%, respectively. Currently data supporting neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy in bladder sparing approaches are emerging, but robust definitive conclusions are still lacking. Gastrointestinal toxicity rates are low around 4% (0.5-16), whereas genitourinary toxicity rates reached 8% (1-24). Quality of life outcomes are still underreported. CONCLUSIONS Published data and clinical experience strongly support trimodal therapy as an acceptable bladder sparing strategy in terms of oncological outcomes and quality of life in selected patients with MIBC. A strong need exists for specialized centers, to increase awareness among urologists, to discuss these options with patients and to stress the increased participation of patients and their families in treatment path decision-making.","Polo-Alonso, Elvira; Kuk, Cynthia; Guruli, Georgi; Paul, Asit K; Thalmann, George; Kamat, Ashish; Solsona, Eduardo; Thalmann, George; Urdaneta, Alfredo I; Zlotta, Alexandre R; Mir, Maria C",Minerva urologica e nefrologica = The Italian journal of urology and nephrology,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0393-2249.20.04018-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33263367/,857
150216,Imaging the COVID-19: a practical guide.,2021-03-19,"The physiological mechanisms by which animals regulate energy expenditure, respond to stimuli and stressors, and maintain homeostasis at the tissue, organ and whole organism levels can be described by 'physiologging'-that is, the use of onboard miniature electronic devices to record physiological metrics of animals in captivity or free-living in the wild. Despite its origins in the 1960s, physiologging has evolved more slowly than its umbrella field of biologging. However, the recording of physiological metrics in free-living animals will be key to solving some of the greatest challenges in biodiversity conservation, issues pertaining to animal health and welfare, and for inspiring future therapeutic strategies for human health. Current physiologging technologies encompass the measurement of physiological variables such as heart rate, brain activity, body temperature, muscle stimulation and dynamic movement, yet future developments will allow for onboard logging of metrics relating to organelle, molecular and genetic function. This article is part of the theme issue 'Measuring physiology in free-living animals (Part II)'.","Hawkes, L A; Fahlman, A; Sato, K","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

619319,COVID-19 pneumonia in kyphoscoliosis: The success stories.,2021-09-16,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and diabetes outcomes (CORONADO) trial revealed that 10.6% of patients with diabetes mellitus hospitalized for COVID-19 (COVID-19) die within 7 days. Several studies from New York, Italy, and China confirm that patients with diabetes are at a much higher risk for mortality due to COVID-19. Besides respiratory illness, COVID-19 increases cardiac injury and diabetic ketoacidosis. In the absence of specific guidelines for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 for patients with diabetes, they remain at higher risk and are more susceptible to COVID-19. Furthermore, there is a scarcity of basic knowledge on how diabetes affects pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In patients with diabetes, impaired glucose use alters metabolic and consequently biological processes instigating pathological remodeling, which has detrimental effects on cardiovascular systems. A majority of biological processes are regulated by noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs), which have emerged as a promising therapeutic candidate for several diseases. In consideration of the higher risk of mortality in patients with diabetes and COVID-19, novel diagnostic test and treatment strategy are urgently warranted in post-COVID-19 era. Here, we describe potential roles of miRNA as a biomarker and therapeutic candidate, especially for heart failure, in patients with diabetes and COVID-19.","Mishra, Paras K.; Tandon, Ritesh; Byrareddy, Siddappa N.",Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol,https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpheart.00489.2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32762561/,857
