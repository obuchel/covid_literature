126660,"Letter by Navarro Castellanos and Dahdah Regarding Article, ""Acute Heart Failure in Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children in the Context of Global SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic"".",2021-03-09,"INTRODUCTION Port closure is essential after successful laparoscopic surgery to prevent incisional hernia. However, good fascial closure still represents a problem, especially in obese patients and when the port wound is oblique. We report a novel technique for port-site closures in such cases. METHODS This study involved 67 obese patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery. We used a novel technique for port-site closure that employed a looped needle passed through two holes in the port sheath. RESULTS The method was used in 67 patients (45 laparoscopic cholecystectomies, 22 laparoscopic hernia repairs), with a mean BMI of 35.7 kg/m2 . No intraoperative incidents or port-site hernias were reported during follow-up (mean, 22 months). CONCLUSION Our procedure is safe, easy, and effective for fascial port site closures, especially in cases of difficult obese patients and oblique port wounds.","Lasheen, Ahmed E; Salem, Ayman; Abd Elaal, Salah; Elsheweal, Abd Elhafez; Osman, Gamal; Alkilany, Mohammed; Ibrahim, Amr",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12302; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27452810/,921
162021,"Letter by Cardenas Suri and Jimomila Bening Regarding Article, ""Acute Heart Failure in Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children in the Context of Global SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic"".",2021-03-09,"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) syndrome is a complex entity, which includes FAP, attenuated FAP, and MUTYH-associated polyposis. These patients are at significant risk for colorectal cancer and carry additional risks for extracolonic malignancies. In this guideline, we reviewed the most recent literature to formulate recommendations on the role of endoscopy in this patient population. Relevant clinical questions were how to identify high-risk individuals warranting genetic testing, when to start screening examinations, what are appropriate surveillance intervals, how to identify endoscopically high-risk features, and what is the role of chemoprevention. A systematic literature search from 2005 to 2018 was performed, in addition to the inclusion of seminal historical studies. Most studies were from worldwide registries, which have compiled years of data regarding the natural history and cancer risks in this cohort. Given that most studies were retrospective, recommendations were based on epidemiologic data and expert opinion. Management of colorectal polyps in FAP has not changed much in recent years, as colectomy in FAP is the standard of care. What is new, however, is the developing body of literature on the role of endoscopy in managing upper GI and small-bowel polyposis, as patients are living longer and improved endoscopic technologies have emerged.","Yang, Julie; Gurudu, Suryakanth R; Koptiuch, Cathryn; Agrawal, Deepak; Buxbaum, James L; Abbas Fehmi, Syed M; Fishman, Douglas S; Khashab, Mouen A; Jamil, Laith H; Jue, Terry L; Law, Joanna K; Lee, Jeffrey K; Naveed, Mariam; Qumseya, Bashar J; Sawhney, Mandeep S; Thosani, Nirav; Wani, Sachin B; Samadder, N Jewel",Gastrointestinal endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gie.2020.01.028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32169282/,921
188190,[Characterization of peripheral dendritic cell subsets and its implication in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome].,2004,"An avirulent, novel variant of equine arteritis virus (EAV; CA95G) was isolated from the semen of a persistently infected Standardbred stallion. The CA95G virus caused subclinical infection and seroconversion in susceptible horses, and virus was isolated only once from blood and nasal secretions collected from 6 experimentally infected horses. Sequence analysis of genes encoding the known EAV structural proteins shows that this highly attenuated strain of EAV is genetically similar to virulent field strains of EAV and, in particular, to a strain of EAV that was isolated during an outbreak of equine viral arteritis in western Canada in 1986. Not only is the carrier stallion the critical natural reservoir of EAV, but genetic diversity of the virus is generated in the course of persistent infection of carrier stallions. The subtle genetic changes that facilitate and maintain persistent EAV infection of the stallion's reproductive tract likely influence phenotypic properties of the virus such as virulence.","Patton, J F; Balasuriya, U B; Hedges, J F; Schweidler, T M; Hullinger, P J; MacLachlan, N J",Archives of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10365172/,921
188790,[Analysis of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Beijing].,2003,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a global surge in the development and implementation of digital interventions to diagnose, track, prevent and mitigate the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. To date, however, there has been little research to characterise the vast scope and scale of these novel, ad hoc and widely varied digital tools. This paper helps fill this gap by providing a descriptive summary of the digital response to COVID-19. The research finds that the digital response can be broken into four main categories: 1) tracking the spread of the virus (contact tracing); 2) controlling social behaviour during the outbreak (social behaviour monitoring); 3) information gathering and dissemination about the virus (one-way and two-way public communications); and 4) diagnosis and treatment (remote diagnostics and treatment). This paper describes the four response categories and provides examples of the digital technologies being developed and implemented for these purposes. This descriptive understanding provides a contextual foundation for subsequent research to analyse the opportunities and challenges associated with the development, implementation and uptake of digital interventions, alongside the development of analytical frameworks and guidance.","Phillips, Jennie; Babcock, Rebecca A; Orbinski, James",Journal of business continuity & emergency planning,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33962702/,921
189138,[The early warning signs of deterioration of severe acute respiratory syndrome].,2004,"The present study is aimed to assess the risk factors for mortality in the first 107 rRT-PCR confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Bolivia. For this observational, retrospective and cross-sectional study, the epidemiological data records were collected from the Hospitals and the Ministry of Health of Bolivia, obtaining the clinical and epidemiological data of the COVID-19 cases that were laboratory-diagnosed during March 2-29, 2020. Samples were tested by rRT-PCR to SARS-CoV-2 at the Laboratory of the National Center of Tropical Diseases (CENETROP), following the protocol Charite, Berlin, Germany. The odds ratio (OR) with respective 95% confidence interval (95%CI) for mortality as dependent variable was calculated. When we comparatively analyzed survivors and non-survivors in this first group of 107 cases in Bolivia, we found that at bivariate analyses, age (±60 years old), hypertension, chronic heart failure, diabetes, and obesity, as well as the requirement of ICU, were significantly exposure variables associated with death. At the multivariate analysis (logistic regression), two variables remained significantly associated, age, ±60 years-old (OR=9.4, 95%CI 1.8-104.1) and hypertension (OR=3.3, 95%CI 1.3-6.3). As expected, age and comorbidities, particularly hypertension, were independent risk factors for mortality in Bolivia in the first 107 cases group. More further studies are required to better define risk factors and preventive measures related to COVID-19 in this and other Latin American countries.","Escalera-Antezana, Juan Pablo; Lizon-Ferrufino, Nicolas Freddy; Maldonado-Alanoca, Americo; Alarcon-De-la-Vega, Gricel; Alvarado-Arnez, Lucia Elena; Balderrama-Saavedra, Maria Alejandra; Bonilla-Aldana, D Katterine; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J",Le infezioni in medicina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32487789/,921

The Treponema pallidum immunization (TPI) and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) tests were non-reactive on all these sera. Thirty-one or 11.3% showed reactive results in the TPHA test. Sera from 267 people who had lepromatous leprosy were also tested in the TPHA test. Fourteen sera were reactive in the TPHA, TPI, and FTA-ABS tests and were from people who had both syphilis and leprosy. Biological false positive reactions were shown by 26 of the leprosy sera, of which three or 11.5% were also reactive in the TPHA test. A further four sera in the leprosy group were reactive only in the TPHA test. The possible cause of false reactive TPHA test results is discussed. It was concluded that where reagin and TPHA tests are reactive in a person who has no history or clinical signs of syphilis, the serum should be referred for TPI and FTA-ABS testing.","Garner, M F; Backhouse, J L; Daskalopoulos, G; Walsh, J L",Journal of clinical pathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4573788/,921
189515,[Pathologic study of circulating blood leukocytes in severe acute respiratory syndrome].,2003,"The macro module is a globular protein domain of about 25 kDa that is evolutionarily conserved in organisms from viruses, bacteria, yeast to humans. It is generally part of proteins that have wide-ranging (and yet to be discovered) cellular functions. There are several examples of macro domains associated with modules showing homology to poly-ADP-ribosyl-polymerases. Many macro domains, including those of the human histone macroH2A1.1, bind NAD metabolites such as ADP-ribose, suggesting that macro domains may function in the recognition of this and related molecules. The presence of a metabolite-binding function in a repressive chromatin component opens new potential connections between chromosome structure, gene silencing and cellular metabolism. Current evidence suggests that macro domains also represent a novel tool for studying NAD metabolites and may be an attractive drug target for the treatment of diseases.","Till, Susanne; Ladurner, Andreas G",Frontiers in bioscience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19273270/,921
190696,[Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome probable patients' virus RNA in Hangzhou by using a two loci and a modified nested real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction].,2005,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY OBJECTIVE The COVID-19 pandemic has forced assisted living facilities (ALF) to implement strict social isolation for residents. Social isolation in the geriatric population is known to negatively impact health. Here, we describe how ALFs in Rhode Island utilized device donations received from Connect for COVID-19, a nationwide nonprofit organization which has mobilized medical students to gather devices for donations to care centers. METHODS Rhode Island ALFs were contacted to determine if they were interested in receiving smart device donations. After donations were made, an impact survey was electronically administered. Primary Results: A total of 11 facilities completed the survey with a response rate of 24% (11/46). The facilities were located throughout all five counties in Rhode Island, with the majority located in Providence County. All but one of the facilities that responded to the survey (n=10, 90.9%) have used the devices to allow residents to video-call their family members. Seven responses (63.6%) indicated that devices were used for more than one purpose. Primary Conclusions: Smart devices were well received by Rhode Island ALFs and used for purposes beyond video conference calls. ALFs should consider advertising the need for devices to encourage community donations. Future studies should investigate the direct impact that digital connectivity has had on Rhode Island ALF residents.","Gallo Marin, Benjamin; Wasserman, Patrick; Cotoia, John; Singh, Manraj; Tarnavska, Vira; Gershon, Linda; Lester, Ian; Merritt, Rory",Rhode Island medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33003682/,921

192123,[Detection for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus RNA in stool of SARS patients].,2004,"Between May 15 and June 20, 2003, 71 suspected cases of monkeypox were investigated and 37 individuals in the United States developed laboratory confirmed monkeypox. These were the first cases of human monkeypox ever documented in the United States or in the Western Hemisphere. The disease was transmitted from small animals imported from Africa to other animals, including prairie dogs sold as pets throughout the U.S. Midwest. Direct contact with the infected animals was the method of infection, and although human to human transmission was thought to have occurred, this was not confirmed by follow up testing. Because of the link with contact with a prairie dog, initial evaluation of the disease was focused toward diseases commonly associated with this animal (e.g., tularemia, plague). Laboratory findings at the Marshfield Clinic in Marshfield, Wisconsin pointed to the presence of an orthopox. The CDC confirmed monkeypox was the infecting orthopox agent. Occupational health nurses from the Marshfield Clinic had direct involvement in the identification and follow up of employees who had direct contact with the diagnosed patients. Programs, such as a respiratory protection program initiated and carried out by Clinic occupational health nurses, were used to prevent employee exposure for Clinic staff. One Clinic employee was thought to potentially have monkeypox because of her direct contact with one of the patients. Four Clinic employees were vaccinated with vaccinia vaccine as a result of their contact with patients or lab specimens. Quarantine of the potentially infected employee and her boyfriend uncovered issues that must be addressed if other infectious diseases requiring quarantine or isolation of individuals emerge or re-emerge. These include a system to compensate individuals in quarantine or isolation who do not have any other source of income. The issue of whether workers' compensation should cover an employee who is quarantined or isolated for a potential work related exposure to an infectious disease if no disease is actually diagnosed also needs to be explored. A better system of getting state or CDC laboratory results back to the local level, including the occupational health area of the generating facility, must be developed. This will be very important if diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or smallpox should re-emerge in the United States. Occupational health nurses are an integral part of any infectious disease process occurring in the United States. The identification of monkeypox in the United States shows that any planning to detect, prevent, and treat diseases with the potential to affect the employee population must include occupational health nurse involvement.","Cunha, Bruce E",AAOHN journal : official journal of the American Association of Occupational Health Nurses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15119816/,921

Mice were inoculated with either T. cruzi, 0.1 median lethal dose (LD50) of coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus [MHV-3] or virus X), or both pathogens. Levels of parasitemia, mortality, and the extent of pathologic alterations in lymphoid organs were determined. Mice inoculated with T. cruzi had mild alterations in their lymphoid organs and survived infection. In contrast, mice inoculated with both pathogens died, and had significantly higher levels of parasitemia and profound alterations in lymphoid organs. These results indicate that the pathologic profile of T. cruzi infection can be profoundly altered by subclinical infection with coronaviruses.","Verinaud, L; Camargo, I J; Vassallo, J; Sakurada, J K; Rangel, H A",Laboratory animal science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10090092/,921

Feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) infection was detected by positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in blood from 2 of 23 wildcats and was tested and confirmed by FeLV isolation in one of the two cats. This is the first time the virus has been clearly demonstrated in a free-living felid, other than the domestic cat. Toxoplasmosis was detected in all cats tested, but neither feline coronavirus nor feline immunodeficiency virus was detected in any sample. The genetic analysis indicated that only 8 of 42 wildcats tested were genetically distinct. These were mainly located in the western highlands of Scotland where ""relict"" populations may have survived. Interbreeding with domestic cats and persecution by trapping and hunting represent major threats to the survival of the European wildcat.","McOrist, S",Revue scientifique et technique,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1339067/,921
197303,"[Epidemiologic features, clinical diagnosis and therapy of first cluster of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome in Beijing area].",2003,"Resveratrol, a polyphenol found in numerous plant species, including mulberries, peanuts and grapes, has shown to possess chemopreventive properties against several cancers, and cardiovascular diseases. Recently, resveratrol has been shown to have positive effects on age longevity, lipid levels and a preventative quality against certain cancers and viral infections. Resveratrol induces apoptosis by up-regulating the expression of Bax, Bak, PUMA, Noxa, Bim, p53, TRAIL, TRAIL-R1/DR4 and TRAIL-R2/DR5 and simultaneously down-regulating the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Mcl-1 and survivin. Resveratrol causes growth arrest at G1 and G1/S phases of cell cycle by inducing the expression of CDK inhibitors p21/WAF1/CIP1 and p27/KIP1. Resveratrol has also been shown to reduce inflammation via inhibition of prostaglandin production, cyclooxygenase-2 activity, and nuclear factor-kappaB activity. Modulation of cell signaling pathway by resveratrol explains its diverse bioactivities related with human health. Resveratrol also potentiates the apoptotic effects of cytokines, chemotherapeutic agents and gamma-radiation. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies demonstrated that the main target organs of resveratrol are liver and kidney, and it is metabolized by hydroxylation, glucuronidation, sulfation and hydrogenation. As a chemoprevention agent, resveratrol has been shown to inhibit tumor initiation, promotion, and progression. There is growing evidence that resveratrol can prevent or delay the onset of various cancers, heart diseases, ischemic and chemically induced injuries, pathological inflammation and viral infections. This review summarizes the molecular mechanisms of resveratrol and its clinical benefits for human diseases.","Shankar, Sharmila; Singh, Gyanendra; Srivastava, Rakesh K",Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17569614/,921
