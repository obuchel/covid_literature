64809,[Clinical analysis of 126 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 with pharyngeal symptoms].,2020-11-07,"BACKGROUND Waveform analysis by visual inspection can be a reliable, noninvasive, and useful tool for detecting patient-ventilator asynchrony. However, it is a skill that requires a properly trained professional. METHODS This observational study was conducted in 17 urban ICUs. Health-care professionals (HCPs) working in these ICUs were asked to recognize different types of asynchrony shown in 3 evaluation videos. The health-care professionals were categorized according to years of experience, prior training in mechanical ventilation, profession, and number of asynchronies identified correctly. RESULTS A total of 366 HCPs were evaluated. Statistically significant differences were found when HCPs with and without prior training in mechanical ventilation (trained vs non-trained HCPs) were compared according to the number of asynchronies detected correctly (of the HCPs who identified 3 asynchronies, 63 [81%] trained vs 15 [19%] non-trained, P < .001; 2 asynchronies, 72 [65%] trained vs 39 [35%] non-trained, P = .034; 1 asynchrony, 55 [47%] trained vs 61 [53%] non-trained, P = .02; 0 asynchronies, 17 [28%] trained vs 44 [72%] non-trained, P < .001). HCPs who had prior training in mechanical ventilation also increased, nearly 4-fold, their odds of identifying ≥2 asynchronies correctly (odds ratio 3.67, 95% CI 1.93-6.96, P < .001). However, neither years of experience nor profession were associated with the ability of HCPs to identify asynchrony. CONCLUSIONS HCPs who have specific training in mechanical ventilation increase their ability to identify asynchrony using waveform analysis. Neither experience nor profession proved to be a relevant factor to identify asynchrony correctly using waveform analysis.","Ramirez, Ivan I; Arellano, Daniel H; Adasme, Rodrigo S; Landeros, Jose M; Salinas, Francisco A; Vargas, Alvaro G; Vasquez, Francisco J; Lobos, Ignacio A; Oyarzun, Magdalena L; Restrepo, Ruben D",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.04750; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28108684/,850

65769,[Research on the psychological status of patients with microtia and their families].,2020-09-07,"The use of intensive sampling methods, such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA), is increasingly prominent in medical research. However, inferences from such data are often limited to the subject-specific mean of the outcome and between-subject variance (i.e., random intercept), despite the capability to examine within-subject variance (i.e., random scale) and associations between covariates and subject-specific mean (i.e., random slope). MixWILD (Mixed model analysis With Intensive Longitudinal Data) is statistical software that tests the effects of subject-level parameters (variance and slope) of time-varying variables, specifically in the context of studies using intensive sampling methods, such as ecological momentary assessment. MixWILD combines estimation of a stage 1 mixed-effects location-scale (MELS) model, including estimation of the subject-specific random effects, with a subsequent stage 2 linear or binary/ordinal logistic regression in which values sampled from each subject's random effect distributions can be used as regressors (and then the results are aggregated across replications). Computations within MixWILD were written in FORTRAN and use maximum likelihood estimation, utilizing both the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and a Newton-Raphson solution. The mean and variance of each individual's random effects used in the sampling are estimated using empirical Bayes equations. This manuscript details the underlying procedures and provides examples illustrating standalone usage and features of MixWILD and its GUI. MixWILD is generalizable to a variety of data collection strategies (i.e., EMA, sensors) as a robust and reproducible method to test predictors of variability in level 1 outcomes and the associations between subject-level parameters (variances and slopes) and level 2 outcomes.","Dzubur, Eldin; Ponnada, Aditya; Nordgren, Rachel; Yang, Chih-Hsiang; Intille, Stephen; Dunton, Genevieve; Hedeker, Donald",Behavior research methods,https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-019-01322-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31898295/,850
66799,[The consensus of Chinese experts on evaluation of endolymphatic hydrops in the inner ear using MRI].,2020-09-07,"INTRODUCTION Peacekeeper-perpetrated sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) account for 36% of the global reports of formal SEA allegations to the UN between 2007 and 2021. However, formally reported SEA represents only a fraction of that which occurs, and community experiences of peacekeeper-perpetrated SEA are likely different than those reflected in official UN documents. METHODS Using mixed-methods, cross-sectional data collected in the DRC in 2018, we used descriptive analysis and multivariate Poisson regression with robust error estimates to examine the participant and narrative characteristics associated with sharing an experience about peacekeeper-perpetrated SEA. RESULTS Participants in Bukavu (adjusted relative risk (aRR) 0.85, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.91) and Kalemie (aRR 0.75, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.81) were less likely to share narratives about sexual interactions, while civilian UN personnel (aRR 1.16, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.34) were slightly more likely to be implicated in narratives about sexual interactions. Narratives in which the outcome was deemed fair to the woman/girl were more likely to be about sexual interactions (aRR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.12). Both the regression analysis and the participants' interpretation of the shared narratives illustrated the significant role poverty played in SEA, suggesting that the outcomes of sexual interactions may have been deemed fair since affected women/girls were perceived to have benefited financially/materially. CONCLUSION There is significant variation between host communities in the likelihood of sharing narratives about SEA, which could prove useful for informing more targeted SEA prevention initiatives. Narratives about sexual interactions with UN personnel were more often deemed to have fair outcomes for the affected women/girls, likely related to ongoing poverty in host communities and perceived financial/material gain. These findings highlight how extreme poverty may impact perceptions around informed consent as well as fairness and require further study. Perceptions around fair outcomes would disincentivise formal reporting, which needs to be considered when devising community-based complaint networks.","Bartels, Susan Andrea; Lusamba, Sandrine; Lee, Sabine",BMJ global health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2021-006631; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34625457/,850

DATA SOURCES A PubMed search was performed using the following search terms: ECMO, ARDS, sedation, COVID-19, coronavirus, opioids, analgesia, fentanyl, hydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone, methadone, ketamine, propofol, dexmedetomidine, clonidine, benzodiazepines, midazolam, lorazepam, and diazepam. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION Relevant clinical and pharmacokinetic studies were considered. All studies included were published between January 1988 and March 2021. DATA SYNTHESIS Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to COVID-19 may progress to requiring VV-ECMO support. Agents frequently used for sedation and analgesia in these patients have been shown to have significant adsorption to ECMO circuitry, leading to possible diminished clinical efficacy. Use of hydromorphone-based analgesia has been associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients on VV-ECMO. However, safety and efficacy regarding use of other agents in this patient population remains an area of further research. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE This review addresses clinical challenges associated with sedation management in COVID-19 patients requiring VV-ECMO support and provides potential strategies to overcome these challenges. CONCLUSIONS Historically, sedation and analgesia management in patients requiring ECMO support have posed a challenge for bedside clinicians given the unique physiological and pharmacokinetic changes in this patient population. A multimodal strategy to managing analgesia and sedation should be used, and the use of enteral agents may play a role in reducing parenteral agent requirements.","Dreucean, Diane; Harris, Jesse E; Voore, Prakruthi; Donahue, Kevin R",The Annals of pharmacotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1177/10600280211010751; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33882694/,850

The aim of this study is to assess the outcomes of the FTRD among its early users in the USA. METHODS Patients who underwent endoscopic full-thickness resection (EFTR) for lower gastrointestinal tract lesions using the FTRD at 26 US tertiary care centers between 10/2017 and 12/2018 were included. Primary outcome was R0 resection rate. Secondary outcomes included rate of technical success (en bloc resection), achievement of histologic full-thickness resection (FTR), and adverse events (AE). RESULTS A total of 95 patients (mean age 65.5 ± 12.6 year, 38.9% F) were included. The most common indication, for use of FTRD, was resection of difficult adenomas (non-lifting, recurrent, residual, or involving appendiceal orifice/diverticular opening) (66.3%), followed by adenocarcinomas (22.1%), and subepithelial tumors (SET) (11.6%). Lesions were located in the proximal colon (61.1%), distal colon (18.9%), or rectum (20%). Mean lesion diameter was 15.5 ± 6.4 mm and 61.1% had a prior resection attempt. The mean total procedure time was 59.7 ± 31.8 min. R0 resection was achieved in 82.7% while technical success was achieved in 84.2%. Histologically FTR was demonstrated in 88.1% of patients. There were five clinical AE (5.3%) with 2 (2.1%) requiring surgical intervention. CONCLUSIONS Results from this first US multicenter study suggest that EFTR with the FTRD is a technically feasible, safe, and effective technique for resecting difficult colonic lesions.","Ichkhanian, Y; Vosoughi, K; Diehl, D L; Grimm, I S; James, T W; Templeton, A W; Hajifathalian, K; Tokar, J L; Samarasena, J B; Chehade, N El Hage; Lee, J; Chang, K; Mizrahi, M; Barawi, M; Irani, S; Friedland, S; Korc, P; Aadam, A A; Al-Haddad, M A; Kowalski, T E; Novikov, A; Smallfield, G; Ginsberg, G G; Oza, V M; Panuu, D; Fukami, N; Pohl, H; Lajin, M; Kumta, N A; Tang, S J; Naga, Y M; Amateau, S K; Brewer, G O I; Kumbhari, V; Sharaiha, R; Khashab, M A",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-020-07504-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32180001/,850

85381,[Management practice of pathology department during the epidemic period of COVID-19].,2021-04-08,"OBJECTIVES Population density can limit the level of care that can be provided in local facilities in Ontario, and as such, patients with severe illnesses often require interfacility transfers to access specialized care. This study aimed to identify causes of delay in interfacility transport by air ambulance in Ontario. METHODS Causes of delay were identified by manual review of electronic patient care records (ePCRs). All emergent interfacility transfers conducted by Ornge, the sole provider of air-based medical transport in Ontario, between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016 were included. The ePCRs were reviewed if they met one or more of the following: (1) contained a standardized delay code; (2) contained free text including ""delay"", ""wait"", or ""duty-out""; (3) were above the 75th percentile in total transport time; or (4) were above the 90th percentile in time to bedside, time at the sending hospital, or time to receiving facility. RESULTS Our search strategy identified 1,220 ePCRs for manual review, which identified a total of 872 delays. Common delays cited included aircraft refueling (234 delays), waiting for land emergency medical service (EMS) escort (146), and staffing- or dispatch-related issues (124). Other delays included weather/environmental hazards (43); mechanical issues (36); and procedures, imaging, or stabilization (80). CONCLUSIONS Some common causes of interfacility delay are potentially modifiable: better trip planning around refueling and improved coordination with local EMS, could reduce delays experienced during interfacility trips. To better understand causes of delay, we would benefit from improved documentation and record availability which limited the results in this study.","Wong, Alanna; McParland, Aidan; Nolan, Brodie",CJEM,https://doi.org/10.1017/cem.2019.444; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084561/,850
88244,"[Analysis on clinical characteristics, diagnosis and treatment of 13 cases of infant hairy polyp].",2020-09-07,"BACKGROUND Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is one of the most frequently diagnosed neoplasms in young adults and is curable even in the relapse setting. Many patients seek advice regarding pregnancy once they have a sustained complete remission (CR). PD1 inhibitors are effective in inducing CRs in relapsed cHL, but little is known about their effects on pregnancy, fetal outcomes, or risk of relapse. The PD1/PDL1 axis is vital in the maintenance of pregnancy, allowing for fetal tolerance. This axis is also a key pathway by which Hodgkin Reed Sternberg cells escape immune surveillance. Thus, exposure to PD1 inhibitors in the context of a pregnant cHL survivor could potentially lead to maternal and fetal complications as well as increase the risk of relapse. Pregnancy and fetal outcomes following PD1 inhibitors have been reported in women with melanoma, but not cHL. Such data may help physicians counsel their patients on this topic. CASE This case describes a 25-year-old woman who was diagnosed with advanced stage cHL that was treated with multiple courses of chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) for primary refractory disease. She experienced a relapse eight months following ASCT and was treated with the PD1 inhibitor pembrolizumab. She completed a total of 21 cycles, achieving a CR after cycle five. After 2 years of sustained CR off pembrolizumab, she had an unassisted and uneventful pregnancy. She delivered a healthy baby boy with no significant complications. He reached his normal milestones in his first year. She remains in CR four years following her last dose of pembrolizumab, evoking the possibility of her being cured of cHL. CONCLUSION Successful pregnancies and fetal outcomes, while maintaining clinical remissions, are possible in women with relapsed cHL treated with pembrolizumab.","Le-Nguyen, Alexandre; Rys, Ryan N; Petrogiannis-Haliotis, Tina; Johnson, Nathalie A",Cancer reports,https://doi.org/10.1002/cnr2.1432; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34047076/,850

Evaluation of changes in gene expression in immune cells can reveal the underlying mechanisms behind vulnerability to infection. A cohort of 60 kidney transplant recipients was evaluated. Gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells 3 months after kidney transplantation was analyzed to compare differences between patients with infection and those who were infection-free in the first year post-transplant. Pro-inflammatory genes such as IL1B, CCL4, and TNF were found to be down-regulated in post-transplant PBMC from patients who developed infection. In contrast, genes involved in metabolism, HLA genes, and transcripts involved in Type I interferon innate antiviral responses were found to be up-regulated. Promoter-based bioinformatic analyses implicated increased activity of Interferon Regulatory Factors, erythroid nuclear factor (E2), and CCAAT-enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) in patients who developed infections. Differential patterns of gene expression were observed in patients who developed infection after kidney transplantation, with patterns distinct from changes associated with patient age, suggesting possible mechanisms behind vulnerability to infection.

93255,[Airway management of COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia].,2020-04-07,"RNA viruses account for numerous emerging and perennial infectious diseases, and are characterized by rapid rates of molecular evolution. The ecological dynamics of most emerging RNA viruses are still poorly understood and difficult to ascertain. The availability of genome sequence data for many RNA viruses, in principle, could be used to infer ecological dynamics if changes in population numbers produced a lasting signature within the pattern of genome evolution. As a result, the rapidly emerging phylogeographic structure of a pathogen, shaped by the rise and fall in the number of infections and their spatial distribution, could be used as a surrogate for direct ecological assessments. Based on rabies virus as our example, we use a model combining ecological and evolutionary processes to test whether variation in the rate of host movement results in predictive diagnostic patterns of pathogen genetic structure. We identify several linearizable relationships between host dispersal rate and measures of phylogenetic structure suggesting genetic information can be used to directly infer ecological process. We also find phylogenetic structure may be more revealing than demography for certain ecological processes. Our approach extends the reach of current analytic frameworks for infectious disease dynamics by linking phylogeography back to underlying ecological processes.","Duke-Sylvester, Scott M; Biek, Roman; Real, Leslie A","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

95017,[Interpretation on the expert consensus of diagnosis and treatment of vocal fold paralysis].,2021-03-07,"BACKGROUND The purpose of our study was to find a novel targeted imaging and drug delivery vehicle for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD is a common and troublesome disease which still lacks effective therapy and imaging options. As an attempt to improve the disease treatment, we tested αMSH for the targeting of nanoliposomes to IBD sites. αMSH, an endogenous tridecapeptide, binds to the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1-R) and has antiinflammatory and immunomodulating effects. MC1-R are found on macrophages, neutrophils and the renal tubule system. We have formulated and tested a liposomal nanoparticle involving αMSH in order to achieve a specific targeting to the inflamed intestines. METHODS NDP-αMSH peptide conjugated to Alexa Fluor™ 680 was linked to the liposomal membrane via N-Succinyl PE and additionally loaded into the lumen of the liposomes. Liposomes without the αMSH-conjugate and free NDP- αMSH were used as a control. The liposomes were also loaded with ICG to track them. The liposomes were tested in DSS treated mice, which had received DSS via drinking order to develop a model IBD. Inflammation severity was assessed by the Disease Activity Index (DAI) score and ex vivo histological CD68 staining of samples taken from different parts of the intestine. The liposome targeting was analyzed by analyzing the ICG and ALEXA 680 fluorescence in the intestine compared to the biodistribution. RESULTS NPD-αMSH was successful labelled with Alexa and retained its biological activity. Liposomes located to expected destinations in the inflamed bowel regions and in the kidneys, where MC1-R are abundant. In vivo liposome targeting correlated with the macrophage concentration at the site of the inflammation supporting the active targeting of the liposomes through αMSH. The liposomal αMSH was well tolerated by animals. CONCLUSIONS This study opens up the possibility to further develop an αMSH targeted theranostic delivery towards clinically relevant different applications in IBD inflammation but also opens possibilities in other inflammations like lung inflammation in Covid 19.","Medina, Tuula Peñate; Damoah, Christabel; Benezra, Miriam; Will, Olga; Kairemo, Kalevi; Humbert, Jana; Seben, Susanne; Medina, Oula Peñate",Current pharmaceutical design,https://doi.org/10.2174/1381612826666200727002716; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32718282/,850

METHODS A retrospective observational study design was used for the secondary data analysis. Data of women aged 15 to 49 years who were diagnosed with menstrual disorders were extracted from The National Health Insurance Service-National Health Screening Cohort in Korea from 2009 to 2016. The age-standardized prevalence rate of menstrual disorders was calculated using SAS version 9.4, and a Chi-square test and Cochran-Armitage test were performed. RESULTS In total, 2,219,445 cases were extracted from the database. The prevalence of menstrual disorders significantly increased from 8.6% to 11.6% (Z=135.16, p for trend <.001) over the past eight years. In particular, it was higher in underweight women than in women with normal weight across all years (Z=-4.18~-14.72, p<.001). Moreover, statistically significant differences in the prevalence of menstrual disorders were found to be associated with drinking and smoking in all years and with physical activity levels in part (p<.05~.001).

High-risk patients have avoided hospital environments fearing infection. We hypothesize that there was also a decrease in the search for medical care related to gastrointestinal emergencies. The aim of this study is to evaluate the frequency of consultations for severe gastrointestinal emergencies during and before the months of the pandemic. METHODS This was a transversal study. The inclusion criteria were cases of consultation in the emergency department for gastrointestinal diseases that required hospitalization, from January to April, from 2015 to 2020. The pediatric population (under age 12) was excluded. RESULTS A total of 2,457 cases of cases was included. The number of emergency hospitalizations for gastrointestinal cases decreased during the first four months of 2020: 108, 112, 82, and 77, respectively. Comparing April of 2020 with previous years, there was a lower than expected number of cases during the social distancing period (P=0.002). CONCLUSION This study reports a pronounced decrease in consultations for severe gastrointestinal emergencies during the pandemic. Governments and society should be aware that health crises do not halt the natural occurrence of noninfectious diseases; otherwise, an increase in mortality from these morbidities may arise.","Leite, Carine; Trindade, Eduardo Neubarth; Grillo, Leonardo Wagner; Trindade, Manoel Roberto Maciel",Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira,https://doi.org/10.1590/1806-9282.66.9.1187; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33027443/,850
112744,[Experts consensus on diagnosis and treatment of vocal fold paralysis].,2021-03-07,"OBJECTIVE To examine the effect of an alternative wound closure method after tumor arthroplasty of the hip compared to routine wound closure with skin staples. METHOD Single center, frequency matched cohort study. We reviewed all patients who underwent tumor resection and endoprosthetic reconstruction of the proximal femur for pathologic fracture due to metastatic bone disease or malignant hematologic bone disease at our center between 2010 and 2014. All patients treated with occlusive wound closure (OWC), a combination of intradermal suture, Steri-Strips™, and an occlusive skin adhesive, during this period ( n = 35), were compared to an equally sized frequency matched group of patients having undergone routine wound closure with conventional skin staples. RESULTS Patients with OWC were significantly faster to achieve dry wound status and consequently had significantly shorter administration of antibiotics and hospital stay. Compared to the patients with conventional wound closure with staples, their wounds were already dry after a mean 3.4 days (vs. 6.7 days [95%CI: 3-3.8 vs. 5.5-7.9], p < 0.0001), they received antibiotics for a mean 4.2 days (vs. 6.8 days [95%CI: 3.7-4.8 vs. 5.5-8.0], p < 0.0003) and their mean hospital stay was 6.3 days (vs. 8.0 days [95%CI: 5.5-7 vs. 6.8-9.3], p < 0.015). Prolonged wound discharge (PWD) for 7 days or more was observed in 34% of patients ( n = 12) in the conventional group, whereas this complication was completely absent ( n = 0) in the investigational group. For every three patients treated with OWC, one complication of PWD over 7 days is avoided (number needed to treat = 3). CONCLUSION Compared to conventional staples, OWC appears to significantly reduce wound complications, use of antibiotics, and hospital stay in patients undergoing tumor arthroplasty procedures of the hip. As such, it may also contribute to a reduction of the substantially increased risk for prosthetic joint infection in this patient population.","Hettwer, Werner H; Horstmann, Peter F; Wu, Chunsen; Petersen, Michael M",Journal of orthopaedic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/2309499018792436; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30131011/,850
115407,[Treatment of spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea in children after cochlear implant with inner ear malformation: a case report].,2020-09-07,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The goal of this study is to combine temporary endovascular bypass (TEB) with a novel shear-activated nanotherapeutic (SA-NT) that releases recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (r-tPA) when exposed to high levels of hemodynamic stress and to determine if this approach can be used to concentrate r-tPA at occlusion sites based on high shear stresses created by stent placement. METHODS A rabbit model of carotid vessel occlusion was used to test the hypothesis that SA-NT treatment coupled with TEB provides high recanalization rates while reducing vascular injury. We evaluated angiographic recanalization with TEB alone, intra-arterial delivery of soluble r-tPA alone, or TEB combined with 2 doses of intra-arterial infusion of either the SA-NT or soluble r-tPA. Vascular injury was compared against stent-retriever thrombectomy. RESULTS Shear-targeted delivery of r-tPA using the SA-NT resulted in the highest rate of complete recanalization when compared with controls (P=0.0011). SA-NT (20 mg) had a higher likelihood of obtaining complete recanalization as compared with TEB alone (odds ratio 65.019, 95% confidence interval 1.77, >1000; P=0.0231), intra-arterial r-tPA alone (odds ratio 65.019, 95% confidence interval 1.77, >1000; P=0.0231), or TEB with soluble r-tPA (2 mg; odds ratio 18.78, 95% confidence interval 1.28, 275.05; P=0.0322). Histological analysis showed circumferential loss of endothelium restricted to the area where the TEB was deployed; however, there was significantly less vascular injury using a TEB as compared with stent-retriever procedure (odds ratio 12.97, 95% confidence interval 8.01, 21.02; P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS A novel intra-arterial, nanoparticle-based thrombolytic therapy combined with TEB achieves high rates of complete recanalization. Moreover, this approach reduces vascular trauma as compared with stent-retriever thrombectomy.","Marosfoi, Miklos G; Korin, Netanel; Gounis, Matthew J; Uzun, Oktay; Vedantham, Srinivasan; Langan, Erin T; Papa, Anne-Laure; Brooks, Olivia W; Johnson, Chris; Puri, Ajit S; Bhatta, Deen; Kanapathipillai, Mathumai; Bronstein, Ben R; Chueh, Ju-Yu; Ingber, Donald E; Wakhloo, Ajay K",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.115.011063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26493676/,850
116289,[Attach importance to COVID-19 infection on maternal and infant outcomes].,2020-03-25,"RATIONALE Conspiracy theories about COVID-19 pose a serious threat to public health by providing false information and undermining official health recommendations. However, existing studies rarely employed longitudinal designs, precluding the determination of the directionality between endorsement of conspiracy theories and its societal consequences. Also, relatively little research examined whether the association between protective health behaviour and the endorsement of conspiracy theories is affected by the content of a given theory. METHODS A four-wave longitudinal panel survey on the association between belief in a wide range of conspiracy theories about COVID-19 and protective behaviour was carried out on a representative sample of Polish citizens (T1 = 1130, T2 = 971, T3 = 818, T4 = 688). Analyses were performed using Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Models. RESULTS The results showed a reciprocal, bidirectional association between conspiracy mentality and protective behaviour. The same effect was also observed between protective behaviour and threat of authoritarianism. We did not find evidence that specific COVID-19 related conspiracy theories directly (and differently) predict within-person changes in protective behaviour over time. CONCLUSIONS Our results showed that the association between various conspiracy-related variables and anti-pandemic COVID-19 variables differs at within- and between-person levels. Changes in the adherence to pro-health measures were negatively predicted by conspiracy mentality and a feeling of threat that the solutions introduced by the government may limit civil rights. Specific conspiracy beliefs were significantly related to protective behaviour only at the between-person level.","Oleksy, Tomasz; Wnuk, Anna; Gambin, Małgorzata; Łyś, Agnieszka",Social science & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34023709/,850

In this study, an individual preceptor site investigated the usefulness of a targeted curriculum in improving students' EHR confidence and clinical reasoning skills. Methods Family medicine clerkship students assigned to one community health center were invited to participate in this prospective, survey-based study. In their first week, students observed a preceptor performing EHR tasks. For the remainder of the 4-week clerkship, students utilized decision support tools, assigned a working diagnosis, entered unsigned orders in the EHR, proposed an assessment, and discussed a plan with a preceptor. Students completed weekly questionnaires to self-report confidence across several EHR domains while preceptors synchronously evaluated students' accuracy with entering orders correctly. Results From February 2017 to March 2020, all 49 eligible students completed the study. One hundred percent of students reported that placing EHR orders was beneficial to their medical education. The difference over time in learner confidence with placing EHR orders was statistically significant across every domain (eg, writing prescriptions, ordering labs and imaging). Preceptors' evaluations of students' accuracy with placing orders also showed significant improvement between each week. Conclusion Clerkship-wide EHR training may be limited by multiple sites with multiple EHR products. This pilot study suggests that committed faculty at an individual preceptor site can offer a targeted curriculum to help students develop EHR confidence. We propose other preceptors similarly offer students this opportunity to maximize clerkship education.","Sarkar, Arindam; Aggarwal, Anjali; Grigoryan, Larissa; Nash, Susan G; Mehrotra, Nidhi; Zoorob, Roger J; Huang, William Y",PRiMER,https://doi.org/10.22454/primer.2021.619838; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34286226/,850

Wear and corrosion of these implants can lead to local and systemic transport of metal debris. This prospective longitudinal study examined the serum chromium and cobalt levels in 24 patients with cobalt-chromium alloy metal-on-metal lumbar disc replacements. METHODS Serum was assayed for chromium (Cr) and cobalt (Co) using high-resolution inductively-coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Detection limits were 0.015 ng/mL for Cr and 0.04 ng/mL for Co. RESULTS Median serum Co levels at pre-op, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36-months post-op were 0.10, 1.03, 0.96, 0.98, 0.67, and 0.52 ng/mL, respectively. Median serum Cr levels were 0.06, 0.49, 0.65, 0.43, 0.52, and 0.50 ng/mL, respectively. CONCLUSION In general, these results indicated that serum Co and Cr levels are elevated at all postoperative time points and are of the same order of magnitude as those observed in well-functioning metal-on-metal surface replacements of the hip and in metal-on-metal total hip replacements at similar postoperative time points.","Gornet, Matthew F; Burkus, J K; Harper, M L; Chan, F W; Skipor, A K; Jacobs, J J","European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the European Spinal Deformity Society, and the European Section of the Cervical Spine Research Society",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00586-012-2581-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23179981/,850

Yet, little is known regarding international variation in critical care services. We sought to understand differences in critical care delivery by comparing data on the distribution of services in eight countries. DESIGN Retrospective review of existing national administrative data. We identified sources of data in each country to provide information on acute care hospitals and beds, intensive care units and beds, intensive care admissions, and definitions of intensive care beds. Data were all referenced and from as close to 2005 as possible. SETTING United States, France, United Kingdom, Canada, Belgium, Germany, The Netherlands, and Spain. PATIENTS Not available. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS No standard definition existed for acute care hospital or intensive care unit beds across countries. Hospital beds varied three-fold from 221/100,000 population in the United States to 593/100,000 in Germany. Adult intensive care unit beds also ranged seven-fold from 3.3/100,000 population in the United Kingdom to 24.0/100,000 in Germany. Volume of intensive care unit admissions per year varied ten-fold from 216/100,000 population in the United Kingdom to 2353/100,000 in Germany. The ratio of intensive care unit beds to hospital beds was highly correlated across all countries except the United States (r = .90). There was minimal correlation between the number of intensive care unit beds per capita and health care spending per capita (r = .45), but high inverse correlation between intensive care unit beds and hospital mortality for intensive care unit patients across countries (r = -.82). CONCLUSIONS Absolute critical care services vary dramatically between countries with wide differences in both numbers of beds and volume of admissions. The number of intensive care unit beds per capita is not strongly correlated with overall health expenditure, but does correlate strongly with mortality. These findings demonstrate the need for critical care data from all countries, as they are essential for interpretation of studies, and policy decisions regarding critical care services.","Wunsch, Hannah; Angus, Derek C; Harrison, David A; Collange, Olivier; Fowler, Robert; Hoste, Eric A J; de Keizer, Nicolette F; Kersten, Alexander; Linde-Zwirble, Walter T; Sandiumenge, Alberto; Rowan, Kathryn M",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0b013e318186aec8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18766102/,850

Seroma formation is a common complication of LVHR. The aim of this study is to review the current evidence on seroma prevention strategies following LVHR. METHODS A systematic search of PubMed, Embase (1946-13 February 2019) and Medline (1946-13 February 2019) databases was conducted using terms which include ""seroma"", ""hernia, ventral"" and ""laparoscopy"". All studies are comparative retrospective or prospective human adult studies in peer-reviewed journals describing at least one intra-operative intervention designed to decrease the rate of seroma formation in laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. RESULTS The database searches identified 3762 citations, and 21 studies were included for final analysis. Five studies compared the different methods of mesh fixation, nine studies compared primary defect closure (PFC) and bridged repair, two studies compared the effect of different types of meshes, two studies looked into the use of electrical cauterization, one study compared single- site laparoscopy with conventional laparoscopy, one study looked into the use of fibrin sealant and one study compared transabdominal preperitoneal placement of mesh with conventional repair. PFC appears to be the most promising with large studies showing a low rate of seroma formation with additional benefits of decreasing wound infection and recurrence rate. Cauterisation of hernia sac and injection of fibrin sealant also show promising results but are mainly derived from small studies. Other strategies did not demonstrate benefit. CONCLUSION Currently, primary fascial closure appears to be the most promising strategy available to decrease seroma formation after LVHR based on the results of large studies. Other promising strategies that decrease dead space such as cauterisation of the sac and fibrin sealant injection will require further multicentre trials to confirm benefit before an increase in operative time and cost can be justified for their routine use.","He, C; Lu, J; Ong, M W; Lee, D J K; Tan, K Y; Chia, C L K",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-019-02098-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31784913/,850

Previous studies on biomarkers in the ED setting has focused on identification of high risk patients, and and the ability to use biomarkers to identify low-risk patients has only been sparsely examined. The broader aims of the TRIAGE study are to develop methods to identify low-risk patients appropriate for early ED discharge by combining information from a wide range of new inflammatory biomarkers and vital signs, the present baseline article aims to describe the formation of the TRIAGE database and characteristize the included patients. METHODS We included consecutive patients ≥ 17 years admitted to hospital after triage staging in the ED. Blood samples for a biobank were collected and plasma stored in a freezer (-80 °C). Triage was done by a trained nurse using the Danish Emergency Proces Triage (DEPT) which categorizes patients as green (not urgent), yellow (urgent), orange (emergent) or red (rescusitation). Presenting complaints, admission diagnoses, comorbidities, length of stay, and 'events' during admission (any of 20 predefined definitive treatments that necessitates in-hospital care), vital signs and routine laboratory tests taken in the ED were aslo included in the database. RESULTS Between September 5(th) 2013 and December 6(th) 2013, 6005 patients were included in the database and the biobank (94.1 % of all admissions). Of these, 1978 (32.9 %) were categorized as green, 2386 (39.7 %) yellow, 1616 (26.9 %) orange and 25 (0.4 %) red. Median age was 62 years (IQR 46-76), 49.8 % were male and median length of stay was 1 day (IQR 0-4). No events were found in 2658 (44.2 %) and 158 (2.6 %) were admitted to intensive or intermediate-intensive care unit and 219 (3.6 %) died within 30 days. A higher triage acuity level was associated with numerous events, including acute surgery, endovascular intervention, i.v. treatment, cardiac arrest, stroke, admission to intensive care, hospital transfer, and mortality within 30 days (p < 0.001).

Although Pwani region is among the predicted risk areas for the DF, there is insufficient data about people's knowledge, attitude and practices towards prevention of DF in their settings. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess knowledge, attitude and practices about DF among adults in Pwani region in Tanzania. Methods The cross-sectional study conducted in Mkuranga District, Pwani region in Tanzania. We used face-to-face interviews to collect data. The main analytical procedure was descriptive using frequencies. Results The majority, 97.7%, were aware of DF. Nevertheless, almost 80% had a low knowledge on symptoms, transmission and vector control measures. Furthermore, less than 20% had positive attitude towards dengue fever prevention, severity of the illness and health seeking behavior. Conclusion Lack of enough knowledge and positive attitude about disease transmission, symptoms and preventive measures put the population at high risk of contracting the disease.

Previously, a 1,470 nm IR laser sealed and cut ex vivo porcine renal arteries of 1-8 mm diameter in 2 seconds, yielding burst pressures greater than 1,200 mmHg and thermal coagulation zones less than 3 mm. This preliminary study describes in vivo testing of a handheld laser probe in a porcine model. METHODS A handheld prototype with vessel/tissue clasping mechanism was tested on 73 blood vessels less than 6 mm diameter using 1,470 nm laser power of 35 W for 1-5 seconds. Device power settings, irradiation time, tissue type, vessel diameter, and histology sample number were recorded for each procedure. The probe was evaluated for hemostasis after sealing isolated and bundled arteriole/venous (A/V) vasculature of porcine abdomen and hind leg. Sealed vessel samples were collected for histological analysis of lateral thermal damage. RESULTS Hemostasis was achieved in 57 of 73 seals (78%). The probe consistently sealed vasculature in small bowel mesentery, mesometrium, and gastrosplenic and epiploic regions. Seal performance was less consistent on hind leg vasculature including saphenous arteries/bundles and femoral and iliac arteries. Collagen denaturation averaged 1.6 ± 0.9 mm in eight samples excised for histologic examination. CONCLUSIONS A handheld laser probe sealed porcine vessels, in vivo. Further probe development and laser parameter optimization is necessary before infrared lasers may be evaluated as an alternative to RF and US vessel sealing devices. Lasers Surg.

METHODS: We prospectively collected data from all adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosed at the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain. All the patients were diagnosed through nasopharyngeal swab PCR. The first surge spanned from 1st March to 13th August 2020, while surge two spanned from 14th August to 8th December 2020. RESULTS: There were 2479 and 852 patients with microbiologically proven SARS-CoV-2 infection in surges one and two, respectively. Patients from surge two were significantly younger (median age 52 (IQR 35) versus 59 (40) years, respectively, p < 0.001), had fewer comorbidities (379/852, 44.5% versus 1237/2479, 49.9%, p 0.007), and there was a shorter interval between onset of symptoms and diagnosis (median 3 (5) versus 4 (5) days, p < 0.001). All-cause in-hospital mortality significantly decreased for both the whole population (24/852, 2.8% versus 218/2479, 8.8%, p < 0.001) and hospitalized patients (20/302, 6.6% versus 206/1570, 13.1%, p 0.012). At adjusted logistic regression analysis, predictors of in-hospital mortality were older age (per year, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.079, 95%CI 1.063-1.094), male sex (aOR 1.476, 95%CI 1.079-2.018), having comorbidities (aOR 1.414, 95%CI 0.934-2.141), ICU admission (aOR 3.812, 95%CI 1.875-7.751), mechanical ventilation (aOR 2.076, 95%CI 0.968-4.454), and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during surge one (with respect to surge two) (aOR 2.176, 95%CI 1.286-3.680).

In this study, we describe a modified protocol of this assay for sensitive detection of functional antigen-specific CD4+ T cells using a monoclonal antibody (clone m24 Ab) specific for the open, high-affinity conformation of the ß2-integrin. The kinetics of ß2-integrin activation was different on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (several hours vs. few minutes, respectively); however, m24 Ab readily stained both cell types 4-6 h after antigen stimulation. With this protocol, we were able to monitor ex vivo effector and memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells specific for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) in whole blood or cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of infected or vaccinated individuals. By costaining ß2-integrin with m24 and CD154 Abs, we assessed extremely low frequencies of polyfunctional CD4+ T cell responses.

267756,Contraceptive advice during COVID-19 pandemic and the overlapping threat of venous thromboembolism,2021,"BACKGROUND: An increasing number of patients achieve a pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemoradiation for locally advanced rectal cancer. Consensus guidelines continue to recommend oncologic resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy in these patients. We hypothesize that there is significant variability in compliance with this recommendation. METHODS: The National Cancer Database was queried from 2006 to 2015 for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by oncologic resection with a pCR (ypT0N0). Hierarchical logistic regression models were used to generate risk and reliability-adjusted rates of adjuvant chemotherapy utilization in patients with pCR at each hospital. RESULTS: In total, 2421 pCR patients were identified. Five-year overall survival was improved in pCR patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy compared with those who did not (92 vs. 85%, p < 0.01). Multivariate analysis indicated that improvement in overall survival remained associated with adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.44-0.82, p < 0.01). The mean adjuvant chemotherapy utilization rate among hospitals was 32%. There was an upward trend in use over the past decade, but two-thirds still do not receive the recommended therapy. High chemotherapy utilizer hospitals were more likely to be academic centers (54.9 vs. 45.9%, p < 0.01) when compared with low chemotherapy utilizers. CONCLUSION: Adjuvant chemotherapy is associated with improved survival in rectal cancer patients with pCR following neoadjuvant chemoradiation and oncologic resection. However, utilization among centers in the USA was only 32% with significant variability across centers. National efforts are needed to standardize treatment patterns according to national guidelines.","Morris, Mackenzie C; Winer, Leah K; Lee, Tiffany C; Shah, Shimul A; Rafferty, Janice F; Paquette, Ian M",J. gastrointest. surg,,850

We also use Hs and Fs to rank the COVID-19 lethality in these countries based on the complexity hierarchy. Our results suggest that the most proactive countries implemented measures such as facemasks, social distancing, quarantine, massive population testing, and hygienic (sanitary) orientations to limit the impacts of COVID-19, which implied lower entropy (higher predictability) to the COVID-19 lethality. In contrast, the most reactive countries implementing these measures depicted higher entropy (lower predictability) to the COVID-19 lethality. Given this, our findings shed light that these preventive measures are efficient to combat the COVID-19 lethality.","Fernandes, Leonardo H S; Araujo, Fernando H A; Silva, Maria A R; Acioli-Santos, Bartolomeu",Results Phys,,850

Bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression examined associations between sociodemographic characteristics and perceived risk of infection and quitting smoking during the initial COVID-19 period. Current smoking was reported by 437 (66.2%) of the 660 participants, 46 (7%) quit during the initial restriction period, and 177 (26.8%) were ex-smokers. Nearly half (44.4%) of current smokers intensified their smoking, and 16% attempted to quit. Quitting during the COVID-19 period was significantly associated with higher education (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.97, 95% CI: 1.0-3.8), not living with a smoker (aOR: 2.18, 95% CI: 1.0-4.4), and having an underlying chronic condition that increases risk for COVID-19 complications (aOR: 2.32, 95% CI: 1.1-4.6).

319133,"[To promote the spirit of combating COVID-19, do our best in pathology]",2021,"Introduction: As of March 11th, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Articles published after the SARS-CoV-1 (2002) epidemic suggest that the use of an herbal-drug integrative medical approach could have contributed to a lower fatality rate and a more rapid response in controlling the outbreak. Methods: Pubmed was searched for articles that investigated the antiviral properties and mechanisms of action of herbs or natural compounds against the SARS-coronavirus (CoV). Results: Forty-three (43) relevant papers were located. A general count rendered 450+ herbs and natural compounds with antiviral properties against the SARS-CoV and related viruses. From the 43 articles, thirty-one (31) uncovered the mechanisms of action of the natural substances able to oppose the coronavirus. Discussion: A series of herbs and natural compounds demonstrated moderate to strong antiviral activity. Research on many herbs-natural compounds also showed potent and significant inhibition of CoV-host protein pathways responsible for different phases of viral replication specifically targeting 3CL PRO, PL PRO, RdRp, helicase protein, S protein, N protein, 3a protein, Cathepsin L, Nsp1, Nsp3c, and ORF7a, and the S protein/ACE-2 interaction. Conclusion: The herbs-natural compounds with antiviral activity and that caused inhibition/blockade of the CoV-host protein pathways are potential therapeutic candidates. The homology between the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 is around 80%. Thus, effective herbs-compounds for the former would likely be beneficial for the latter also depending on target protein similarities between the viruses. Here we provide the mechanistic bases supporting an integrative approach that includes natural compounds to fight coronavirus infections.","Fuzimoto, Andréa D.; Isidoro, Ciro",J. Tradit. Complement.

319341,[Interpretation on the expert consensus of diagnosis and treatment of vocal fold paralysis],2021,"Trypophobia is induced by viewing multiple clustered objects. To date, several studies have investigated why certain people experience discomfort when looking at clustered patterns. Recently, ""involuntary protection against dermatosis"" (IPAD) hypothesis was proposed to explain the causes of trypophobia. The IPAD hypothesis suggests that involuntary aversive responses to skin diseases cause discomfort in response to image clusters. However, this idea has not been fully investigated empirically. Therefore, the present study used a modified version of the priming procedure and tested whether the activation of the concept of skin-related diseases affected the evaluation of trypophobic images. In Experiment 1, participants engaged in a lexical decision task in which words related to skin problems, negative events, or neutral events were presented. Then, they evaluated the discomfort of trypophobic, negative, and neutral images. The results indicated that participants evaluated trypophobic images as more discomforting after they were exposed to skin-problem-related words, whereas the exposure to words related to skin-problems did not enhance the discomfort of negative images. These findings demonstrate that the association with skin-related problems increases the discomfort of trypophobic images. In Experiment 2, we further tested the reproducibility of the priming effect observed in Experiment 1 and investigated the effect of priming with words related to COVID-19 in the context of a spreading infection. Contrary to predictions, no priming effect was produced by either skin-related words or COVID-19-related words. Future studies should further explore the causal relationship of the association between skin disease and trypophobia.","Shirai, Risako; Ogawa, Hirokazu",Sci Rep,,850

Objetivou-se relatar a ocorrência de um surto de esporotricose felina na Região Metropolitana do Recife. Foram coletados suabes de úlceras cutâneas de felinos atendidos no Hospital Veterinário da Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco e em Clínicas Veterinárias particulares. O diagnóstico foi realizado por meio de exame citológico e cultura fúngica. Dos 115 casos suspeitos, 59 casos foram confirmados, número nunca registrado anteriormente no estado de Pernambuco. Os casos de esporotricose felina registrados têm demonstrado aspectos clínicos e epidemiológicos semelhantes aos ocorridos em outras regiões do país, caracterizando-se como uma doença predominantemente de machos jovens em idade reprodutiva e semi-domiciliados, de difícil tratamento e de rápida disseminação.(AU)","Silva, Grasiene M; Howes, Julio Cesar F; Leal, Carlos Adriano S; Mesquita, Emanuela P; Pedrosa, Camila M; Oliveira, Andréia Alice F; Silva, Leonildo Bento G; Mota, Rinaldo A",Pesqui. vet. bras,,850
410486,Higher expression of monocyte chemotactic protein 1 in mild COVID-19 patients might be correlated with inhibition of Type I IFN signaling,2021,"PURPOSE: The emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2 pathogen and lethal COVID-19 disease pandemic poses major diagnostic challenges. The study aims to describe the spectrum and prevalence of thoracic and extrathoracic incidental findings in patients who have undergone 18F-FDG PET/CT during the first 3 weeks of the COVID-19 UK lockdown. METHODS: This is a single-centre retrospective controlled observational study. 18F-FDG PET/CT scans (n = 160) acquired from 23/3/2020 to 9/4/2020 were retrospectively reviewed for incidental findings in the lungs and extrapulmonary sites (heart, nasal sinuses, parotid and salivary glands, colon, large vessels, renal cortex, brain, spleen and testes). A date-matched control group (n = 205) of patients from 2019 was used for comparison. RESULTS: The total prevalence of suspicious findings was 26/160 (16.25%). Fifteen patients presented with incidental findings in the lungs, while eleven patients had only non-pulmonary incidental findings. There was a significant increase in the appearance of incidental 18F-FDG PET/CT findings during the 2nd week (OR = 3.8) and 3rd week (OR = 7.6) in relation to the 1st week. There was a significant increase in the average maximum standardised uptake values (SUVmax) in the parotid/salivary glands of patients scanned during week 2 in relation to week 1 (p = 0.036). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of incidental findings compared to the control group, but the number of pulmonary vs. extrathoracic findings was different between the two populations. CONCLUSION: The study provides a novel base of evidence to identify asymptomatic patients and those without symptoms strongly associated with COVID-19 with incidental 18F-FDG PET/CT findings suspicious of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the initial stages of the pandemic.","Halsey, Richard; Priftakis, Dimitrios; Mackenzie, Strachan; Wan, Simon; Davis, Laura M; Lilburn, David; Thornton, Andrew; Papathanasiou, Nikolaos; Gnanasegaran, Gopinath; Bomanji, Jamshed",Eur. j. nucl. med. mol. imaging,,850

420489,[Expression and pathological role of galectin-10 in different types of nasal polyps],2020,"White clover (Trifolium repens L.) is a widely cultivated cool-season perennial forage legume in temperate grassland systems. Many studies have analyzed the gene expression in this grass species using quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). The selection of stable reference genes for qRT-PCR is crucial. However, there was no detailed study on reference genes in different tissues of white clover under various abiotic stress conditions. Herein, 14 candidate reference genes (ACT7, ACT101, TUA1109, TUB, CYP, 60SrRNA, UBQ, E3, GAPDH1, GAPDH2, PP2A, BAM3, SAMDC, and ABC) were selected and analyzed by four programs (GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder). Samples were taken from two tissues (leaves and roots) under five different abiotic stresses (drought, salt, heat, cold, and heavy metal stress). Our results showed that 60SrRNA and ACT101 were the two top-ranked genes for all samples. Under various experimental conditions, the most stable gene was different; however, SAMDC, UBQ, 60SrRNA, and ACT101 were always top ranked. The most suitable reference genes should be selected according to different plant tissues and growth conditions. Validation of these reference genes by expression analysis of Cyt-Cu/Zn SOD and CAT confirmed their reliability. Our study will benefit the subsequent research of gene function in this species.","Pu, Qi; Li, Zhou; Nie, Gang; Zhou, Jiqiong; Liu, Lin; Peng, Yan",,,850

From the environmental perspective, the obtained road traffic reduction of 20–50% could be regarded as an undesired traffic regulation experiment. Air quality impacts within Hungary were evaluated based on data from 52 monitoring sites measuring concentrations of pollutants NOx, O3, and PM10. Air pollution during the lockdown was compared to the same period (February–June) in the reference years 2014–2019. The large spatial heterogeneity of the air quality response was explored. The emission reduction coincided with the extreme weather of 2020, characterized by unusually warm pre-lockdown February and spring drought. The anomalously low pre-lockdown air pollution was further reduced (NOx) or increased (PM10) during the restrictions. Compared to the previous years, NOx concentrations during the curfew were found to differ between −4.1 and +0.2 standard deviations (median −1.55 SD), or −45% and +3% (median −18%) among different monitoring locations. Ozone concentrations were unusually high due to both weather and chemical reasons (median +11% or +0.8 SD), while the PM10 response was modest and largely weather-driven (median +7% or +0.4 SD).","Varga-Balogh, Adrienn Leelőssy Ádám Mészáros Róbert",Atmosphere,,850

459481,[Discussion on the autopsy and pathological sampling procedure for coronavirus pneumonia(COVID-19) victims],2021,"BACKGROUND: Murder is one of the public health problems. According to the WHO reports, murder is fourth leading cause of death among young people. The aim of this study was applying joint point regression model to study trend of homicide mortality in Iran, 2006-2016. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional panel (pseudo-panel) study. METHODS: Homicide data during 2006 to 2016 were extracted from Iranian legal medicine organization. Trends of homicide incidence were summarized by annual percent change (APC) and average annual percent change (AAPC) using non-linear segmented regression model. RESULTS: Totally, 26918 homicide cases occurred during the period from 2006 to 2016. The highest and lowest frequency was related to the 15-29 yr (46.5%) and 0-4 yr (1.5%) age groups, respectively. The homicide incidence rate of the country in 2016 was 2.81 per 100,000. The four provinces of Sistan & Baluchistan, Khuzestan, Kerman and Ilam had the highest incidence rate in 2016, respectively. During the study period, the incidence rate of homicide in Iran and men have been significantly decreased (APC: -2.8% (95% CI: -3.9, -1.7) and -3.2% (95% CI: - 4.5, -1.8) respectively (P<0.001)). CONCLUSION: The pattern of homicide rate has a downward trend in the country. Moreover, the varying observed trends in some provinces can be due to the variability in mental, geographical, socio-economic and cultural conditions in each region.","Nazari Kangavari, Hajar; Barzegar, Abdolrazagh; Mirtorabi, Seyed Davood; Ghadirzadeh, Mohammad Reza; Forouzesh, Mehdi; Taherpour, Niloufar; Shahbazi, Fatemeh; Hashemi Nazari, Seyed Saeed",J Res Health Sci,,850

476290,[Clinical cure strategy for hepatitis B: immunomodulatory therapy],2020,"The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) outbreak that is caused by a highly contagious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a zoonotic pandemic, with approximately 24.5 million positive cases and 8.3 lakhs deaths globally. The lack of effective drugs or vaccine provoked the research for drug candidates that can disrupt the spread and progression of the virus. The identification of drug molecules through experimental studies is time-consuming and expensive, so there is a need for developing alternative strategies like in silico approaches which can yield better outcomes in less time. Herein, we selected transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) enzyme, a potential pharmacological target against SARS-CoV-2, involved in the spread and pathogenesis of the virus. Since 3D structure is not available for this protein, the present study aims at homology modelling and validation of TMPRSS2 using Swiss-model server. Validation of the modelled TMPRSS2 using various online tools confirmed model accuracy, topology and stereochemical plausibility. The catalytic triad consisting of Serine-441, Histidine-296 and Aspartic acid-345 was identified as active binding site of TMPRSS2 using existing ligands. Molecular docking studies of various drugs and phytochemicals against the modelled TMPRSS2 were performed using camostat as a standard drug. The results revealed eight potential drug candidates, namely nafamostat, meloxicam, ganodermanontriol, columbin, myricetin, proanthocyanidin A2, jatrorrhizine and baicalein, which were further studied for ADME/T properties. In conclusion, the study unravelled eight high affinity binding compounds, which may serve as potent antagonists against TMPRSS2 to impact COVID-19 drug therapy.","M, Pooja; Reddy, Gangavaram Jyothi; Hema, Kanipakam; Dodoala, Sujatha; Koganti, Bharathi",Eur J Pharmacol,,850
643374,Fibrotic lung disease: A molecular glimpse into severe Covid-19?,2021-07-03,"A large amount of evidence has supported a clinical link between diabetes and inflammatory diseases, e.g., cancer, dementia, and hypertension. In addition, it is also suggested that dysregulations related to Ca(2+ )signaling could link these diseases, in addition to 3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathways. Thus, revealing this interplay between diabetes and inflammatory diseases may provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of these diseases. Publications involving signaling pathways related to Ca(2+) and cAMP, inflammation, diabetes, dementia, cancer, and hypertension (alone or combined) were collected by searching PubMed and EMBASE. Both signaling pathways, Ca(2+) and cAMP signaling, control the release of neurotransmitters and hormones, in addition to neurodegeneration, and tumor growth. Furthermore, there is a clear relationship between Ca(2+) signaling, e.g., increased Ca(2+) signals, and inflammatory responses. cAMP also regulates pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. Due to the experience of our group in this field, this article discusses the role of Ca(2+) and cAMP signaling in the correlation between diabetes and inflammatory diseases, including its pharmacological implications. As a novelty, this article also includes: (1) A timeline of the major events in Ca(2+)/cAMP signaling; and (2) As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging and rapidly evolving situation, this article also discusses recent reports on the role of Ca(2+) channel blockers for preventing Ca(2+) signaling disruption due to COVID-19, including the correlation between COVID-19 and diabetes.","Bergantin, Leandro Bueno",World J Diabetes,https://doi.org/10.4239/wjd.v12.i6.767; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34168726/,850
