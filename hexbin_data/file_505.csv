To increase our understanding of hvKP at the genome level, genome sequencing and comparative genome analysis were performed on 6 hvKPs. The whole genome DNA from 6 hvKPs with different capsular serotypes isolated in China was extracted. The genome sequencing and assembly results showed the genome size of the six hvKPs and GC content. Comparative analyses of the genomes revealed the gene homology and genome rearrangement in the 6 hvKPs compared with Klebsiella pneumonia NTUH-K2044. The phylogenetic tree based on full-genome SNPs of the 7 hvKPs showed that NTUH-K2044 formed a single clade, showing distant evolutionary distances with the other six strains, and the non-K1 hvKP strains had a relatively closer phylogenetic relationship. BLAST comparison analysis found that some selected virulence genes had different degrees of deletion in the non-K1 hvKPs. SNP-based virulence gene mutation analysis showed that some virulence genes had different degrees of SNP mutations. The whole-genome sequencing and comparative genome analysis of six hvKP strains with NTUH-K2044 provide us with a basic understanding of the genome composition, genetic polymorphism, evolution and virulence genes of hvKP and a basis for further research on these genes and the pathogenesis of hvKP.

Transverse and longitudinal cephalometric images of 832 patients were used for training and testing of CNNs (365 males and 467 females). Labeling was performed such that the jawbone was sufficiently masked, while the parts other than the jawbone were minimally masked. DenseNet was used as the feature extractor. Five random sampling crossvalidations were performed for two datasets. The average and maximum accuracy of the five crossvalidations were 90.43% and 92.54% for test 1 (evaluation of the entire posterior–anterior (PA) and lateral cephalometric images) and 88.17% and 88.70% for test 2 (evaluation of the PA and lateral cephalometric images obscuring the mandible). In this study, we found that even when jawbones of class I (normal mandible), class II (retrognathism), and class III (prognathism) are masked, their identification is possible through deep learning applied only in the cranio-spinal area. This suggests that cranio-spinal differences between each class exist.","Jeong, Seung Hyun; Yun, Jong Pil; Yeom, Han-Gyeol; Kim, Hwi Kang; Kim, Bong Chul",Diagnostics (Basel),505,22

Artificial intelligence applications could assist in achieving the above. The World Health Organization and global healthcare systems have already recognized the use of artificial intelligence technologies to address ‘system gaps’ and automate some of the more cumbersome tasks to optimize clinical services and reduce health inequalities. Currently, both mental health and obstetric and gynaecological services independently use artificial intelligence applications. Thus, suitable solutions are shared between mental health and obstetric and gynaecological clinical practices, independent of one another. Although, to address complexities with some patients who may have often interchanging sequelae with mental health and obstetric and gynaecological illnesses, ‘holistically’ developed artificial intelligence applications could be useful. Therefore, we present a rapid review to understand the currently available artificial intelligence applications and research into multi-morbid conditions, including clinical trial-based validations. Most artificial intelligence applications are intrinsically data-driven tools, and their validation in healthcare can be challenging as they require large-scale clinical trials. Furthermore, most artificial intelligence applications use rate-limiting mock data sets, which restrict their applicability to a clinical population. Some researchers may fail to recognize the randomness in the data generating processes in clinical care from a statistical perspective with a potentially minimal representation of a population, limiting their applicability within a real-world setting. However, novel, innovative trial designs could pave the way to generate better data sets that are generalizable to the entire global population. A collaboration between artificial intelligence and statistical models could be developed and deployed with algorithmic and domain interpretability to achieve this. In addition, acquiring big data sets is vital to ensure these artificial intelligence applications provide the highest accuracy within a real-world setting, especially when used as part of a clinical diagnosis or treatment.","Delanerolle, Gayathri; Yang, Xuzhi; Shetty, Suchith; Raymont, Vanessa; Shetty, Ashish; Phiri, Peter; Hapangama, Dharani K; Tempest, Nicola; Majumder, Kingshuk; Shi, Jian Qing",Womens Health (Lond),505,1
17920,17920,17920,One year on: Are we ready for COVID?(),16.547935,2.25846,2021-05-29,"BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of Takotsubo syndrome is made based on clinical presentation, ECG, biomarker, imaging and coronary angiography. There is a lack of diagnostic biomarkers that can discriminate patients with Takotsubo syndrome from those with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and provide clinical monitoring and prognostic information in the long-term. METHODS: A literature search of published Takotsubo syndrome biomarkers from PubMed was performed. All studies that included numerical biomarker data on Takotsubo syndrome was included. Exclusion criteria was any study without an AMI cohort for comparison in the acute phase biomarkers or due to the absence of numerical values. The results were tabulated in table form with results expressed as either mean ± SD or median (interquartile range). RESULTS: The literature search produced 14 relevant studies that met search criteria. The results showed; high sensitivity Troponin I (3.21 ± 4.4 vs 34.4 ± 37 ng/ml), BNP [972 (578.5–1671.0) pg/L vs 358 (50.5–688.0) pg/L in NSTEMI and vs 381 (106.0–934.0) pg/L in STEMI] and BNP/Troponin I ratio [642 (331.8–1226.5) vs 184.5 (50.5–372.3) pg/ug in NSTEMI and 7.5 (2.0–29.6) pg/ug in STEMI] patients. DISCUSSION: This study is limited by many studies being retrospective cohort studies. This data shows that acutely troponin is raised in Takotsubo syndrome but not enough to be discriminating from AMI. BNP level is significantly raised in Takotsubo syndrome compared to AMI. CONCLUSION: Current specificity of acute and chronic biomarkers for Takotsubo syndrome is lacking and further work is needed to address the gap in knowledge.","Khan, Hilal; Gamble, David; Mezincescu, Alice; Abbas, Hassan; Rudd, Amelia; Dawson, Dana",Int J Cardiol Heart Vasc,505,1

Mobile health (mHealth) technologies (SMS text messaging– or app-based) have the potential to provide patients with educational, emotional, and motivational support for opioid tapering beyond what is offered by their health care provider. However, it is not known whether patients with chronic pain who are tapering opioids would be willing or able to engage with technology-based support. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine patients’ use of mobile technologies in health care, interest in using mHealth support, preferences for the form and content of mHealth support, and potential barriers to and facilitators of engagement with mHealth support for opioid tapering. METHODS: A total of 21 patients (11 women and 10 men; age range 29-83 years) with chronic noncancer pain on long-term opioid therapy who had recently initiated a voluntary opioid taper were recruited from primary and tertiary care clinics in metropolitan and regional Australia for a larger study of patients’ experiences of opioid tapering. Participants had been taking prescription opioids for a mean duration of 13 (SD 9.6; range 0.25-30) years at the time of the study. Survey items characterized participants’ typical mobile phone use and level of interest in mobile technology–based support for opioid tapering. Semistructured interviews further explored patients’ use of mobile technologies and their interest in, preferences for, and perspectives on potential barriers to and facilitators of engagement with mHealth support for opioid tapering. Two researchers collaborated to conduct a thematic analysis of the interview data. RESULTS: All participants reported owning and using a mobile phone, and most (17/21, 81%) participants reported using mobile apps. The majority of participants expressed interest in SMS text messaging–based (17/21, 81%) and app-based (15/21, 71%) support for opioid tapering. Participants expected that messages delivering both informational and socioemotional support would be helpful. Participants expected that access to technology, mobile reception, internet connectivity, vision impairment, and low self-efficacy for using apps may be barriers to user engagement. Patients expected that continuity of care from their health care provider, flexible message dosing, responsivity, and familiarity with pain self-management strategies would increase user engagement. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that patients with chronic noncancer pain may be willing to engage with SMS text messaging–based and app-based mHealth interventions to support opioid tapering. However, the feasibility and acceptability of these interventions may depend on how patients’ preferences for functionality, content, and design are addressed.","Magee, Michael Reece; McNeilage, Amy Gray; Avery, Nicholas; Glare, Paul; Ashton-James, Claire Elizabeth",JMIR Form Res,505,1

However, transgene expression in certain cell types is sometimes not desirable, either because of toxicity, cell transformation, or induction of transgene-specific immune responses. In other cases, specific targeting of only cancerous cells within a tumor is sought after for the delivery of suicide genes. Consequently, great effort has been invested in developing strategies to control transgene delivery/expression in a cell/tissue-specific manner. These strategies can broadly be divided in three; particle pseudotyping (surface targeting), which entails modification of the envelope glycoprotein (ENV); transcriptional targeting, which utilizes cell-specific promoters and/or inducible promoters; and posttranscriptional targeting, recently applied in lentivectors by introducing sequence targets for cell-specific microRNAs. In this chapter we describe each of these strategies providing some illustrative examples.","Escors, David; Kochan, Grazyna; Stephenson, Holly; Breckpot, Karine",Lentiviral Vectors and Gene Therapy,505,30

They are known to reside within endo-lysosomes where they acquire optimal conditions for proteolytic activity and substrate cleavage. However, cathepsins have been detected in locations other than the canonical compartments of the endocytotic pathway. They are often secreted from cells in either proteolytically inactive proform or as mature and active enzyme; this may happen in both physiological and pathological conditions. Moreover, cytosolic and nuclear forms of cathepsins have been described and are currently an emerging field of research aiming at understanding their functions in such unexpected cellular locations. This chapter summarizes the canonical pathways of biosynthesis and transport of cathepsins in healthy cells. We further describe how cathepsins can reach unexpected locations such as the extracellular space or the cytosol and the nuclear matrix. No matter where viruses and cathepsins encounter, several outcomes can be perceived. Thus, scenarios are discussed on how cathepsins may support virus entry into host cells, involve in viral fusion factor and polyprotein processing in different host cell compartments, or help in packaging of viral particles during maturation. It is of note to mention that this review is not meant to comprehensively cover the present literature on viruses encountering cathepsins but rather illustrates, on some representative examples, the possible roles of cathepsins in replication of viruses and in the course of disease.","Brix, Klaudia",Activation of Viruses by Host Proteases,505,5

Since the introduction of GLPs, regulatory agencies worldwide have increasingly required additional types of safety studies, such as viral clearance studies for plasma‐derived and biotechnology products, to be performed in accordance with the principles of the GLP regulations. Establishment of a GLP compliance program for non‐toxicology safety studies, however, has many challenges. In a viral validation study, a bench‐scale model of a manufacturing step is developed and is used to evaluate virus clearance, and so, many GLP elements such as the definitions for test article and test system, are not directly applicable. In spite of these difficulties, GLP concepts can be implemented as much as possible to ensure the integrity of the study. A GLP compliance program, with application to a number of disciplines, including viral validation, was established at Bayer HealthCare Biological Products Division. Integral to the effort was a multi‐functional team comprised of members from the quality Assurance Unit (QAU) and different departments within Research and Development (R&D). The team is primarily responsible for preparing, reviewing, and harmonizing the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) used in all regulated non‐clinical laboratory studies. Through the effective interactions between R&D and QAU, study participants gain essential knowledge and experience in GLPs. In addition to performing audits, the QAU plays an important role in the implementation of strategies for GLP compliance. As a result, significant progress has been made toward meeting the challenges of establishing a GLP compliance program for non‐toxicology safety studies.

The seller announces a price and the buyer can decide to buy the item at the announced price or the buyer can decide not to buy the item. In this paper we study the problem from the perspective of the buyer who only gets to observe a stochastic measurement of the valuation of the item after he buys the item. Furthermore, in our model the buyer uses fuzzy sets to describe his satisfaction with the observed valuations and he uses fuzzy sets to describe his dissatisfaction with the observed price. In our problem, the buyer makes decisions based on the probability of a fuzzy event. His decision to buy or not depends on whether the satisfaction from having a high enough valuation for the item out weights the dissatisfaction of the quoted price.

In this paper we investigate multiple multivariate time series, because we assume a higher information value than regarding only one time series at a time. There are several approaches which make use of the granger causality or the cross correlation in order to analyze the influence of time series on each other. In this paper we extend the idea of mutual influence and present FCSETS (Fuzzy Clustering Stability Evaluation of Time Series), a new approach which makes use of the membership degree produced by the fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm. We first cluster time series per timestamp and then compare the relative assignment agreement (introduced by Eyke Hüllermeier and Maria Rifqi) of all subsequences. This leads us to a stability score for every time series which itself can be used to evaluate single time series in the data set. It is then used to rate the stability of the entire clustering. The stability score of a time series is higher the more the time series sticks to its peers over time. This not only reveals a new idea of mutual time series impact but also enables the identification of an optimal amount of clusters per timestamp. We applied our model on different data, such as financial, country related economy and generated data, and present the results.","Klassen, Gerhard; Tatusch, Martha; Himmelspach, Ludmila; Conrad, Stefan",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,505,1

High fidelity is gained thanks to the spatial resolution of the computational grids and a key enabler to have a proper exchange of information between the structural solver and the fluid one is the management of the interfaces. A class of applications consists in problems where the complex movement of the walls is known in advance or can be computed by FEM and has to be transferred to the CFD solver. The aforementioned approach, known also as one-way FSI, requires effective methods for the time marching adaption of the computation grid of the CFD model. A versatile and well established approach consists in a continuum update of the mesh that is regenerated so to fit the evolution of the moving walls. In this study, an innovative method based on Radial Basis Functions (RBF) mesh morphing is proposed, allowing to keep the same mesh topology suitable for a continuum update of the shape.

The Experience of Syrian Refugees in Lethbridge in Alberta, Canada",16.15991,2.3116407,2020-07-04,"Modern parallel SAT solvers rely heavily on effective clause sharing policies for their performance. The core problem being addressed by these policies can be succinctly stated as “the problem of identifying high-quality learnt clauses”. These clauses, when shared between the worker nodes of parallel solvers, should lead to better performance. The term “high-quality clauses” is often defined in terms of metrics that solver designers have identified over years of empirical study. Some of the more well-known metrics to identify high-quality clauses for sharing include clause length, literal block distance (LBD), and clause usage in propagation. In this paper, we propose a new metric aimed at identifying high-quality learnt clauses and a concomitant clause-sharing policy based on a combination of LBD and community structure of Boolean formulas. The concept of community structure has been proposed as a possible explanation for the extraordinary performance of SAT solvers in industrial instances. Hence, it is a natural candidate as a basis for a metric to identify high-quality clauses. To be more precise, our metric identifies clauses that have low LBD and low community number as ones that are high-quality for applications such as verification and testing. The community number of a clause C measures the number of different communities of a formula that the variables in C span. We perform extensive empirical analysis of our metric and clause-sharing policy, and show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on the benchmark from the parallel track of the last four SAT competitions.","Vallade, Vincent; Le Frioux, Ludovic; Baarir, Souheib; Sopena, Julien; Ganesh, Vijay; Kordon, Fabrice",Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing - SAT 2020,505,1

METHODS: Selected samples collected from abortion outbreaks due to toxoplasmosis (n = 31) and from chronically infected adult sheep at slaughterhouses (n = 50) in different Spanish regions were bioassayed in mice, aiming at parasite isolation. In addition, all original clinical samples and the resulting isolates were genotyped by multi-nested PCR-RFLP analysis of 11 molecular markers and by PCR-DNA sequencing of portions of the SAG3, GRA6 and GRA7 genes. RESULTS: As a result, 30 isolates were obtained from 9 Spanish regions: 10 isolates from abortion-derived samples and 20 isolates from adult myocardial tissues. Overall, 3 genotypes were found: ToxoDB#3 (type II PRU variant) in 90% (27/30) of isolates, ToxoDB#2 (clonal type III) in 6.7% (2/30), and ToxoDB#1 (clonal type II) in 3.3% (1/30). When T. gondii-positive tissue samples (n = 151) were directly subjected to RFLP genotyping, complete restriction profiles were obtained for 33% of samples, and up to 98% of the specimens belonged to the type II PRU variant. A foetal brain showed a clonal type II pattern, and four specimens showed unexpected type I alleles at the SAG3 marker, including two foetal brains that showed I + II alleles as co-infection events. Amplicons of SAG3, GRA6 and GRA7 obtained from isolates and clinical samples were subjected to sequencing, allowing us to confirm RFLP results and to detect different single-nucleotide polymorphisms. CONCLUSIONS: The present study informed the existence of a predominant type II PRU variant genotype (ToxoDB#3) infecting domestic sheep in Spain, in both abortion cases and chronic infections in adults, coexisting with other clonal (ToxoDB#1 and ToxoDB#2), much less frequent genotypes, as well as polymorphic strains as revealed by clinical sample genotyping. The use of multilocus sequence typing aided in accurately estimating T. gondii intragenotype diversity.

Therefore, we sought to determine the risk for mortality in PTPs receiving an MT of ≥ 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) within 24 h. We compared PRBC: plasma ratio of > 2:1 (Unbalanced Ratios, UR) versus ≤ 2:1 (Balanced Ratios, BR), hypothesizing decreased risk of mortality with BR. METHODS: The Trauma Quality Improvement Program was queried (2014–2016) for PTPs receiving a MT. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to determine risk of mortality. RESULTS: From 239 PTPs receiving an MT, 98 (41%) received an UR, whereas 141 (59%) received a BR. The median ratios, respectively, were 2.7:1 and 1.2:1. Compared to BR patients, UR patients had no differences in injury severity score (ISS), hypotension on admission, and intensive care unit stay (all p > 0.05). The mortality rates for BR and UR were similar (46.1% vs. 52.0%, p = 0.366). Controlling for age, ISS, and severe head injury, UR demonstrated similar risk of mortality compared to BR (p = 0.276). Additionally, ≥ 4:1 ratio versus ≤ 2:1 showed no difference in associated risk of mortality (p = 0.489). CONCLUSION: In contrast to adult studies, this study demonstrated that MT ratios of > 2:1 and even ≥ 4:1 were associated with similar mortality compared to BR for PTPs. These results suggest pediatric MT resuscitation may not require strict BR as has been shown beneficial in adult trauma patients. Future prospective studies are needed to evaluate the optimal ratio for PTP MT resuscitation.

METHODS: An SH3PXD2A-AS1 expression dataset was retrieved and analyzed from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, and SH3PXD2A-AS1 expression was determined in our cohort of 134 ESCC patients by using quantitative PCR. The clinical significance of SH3PXD2A-AS1 expression was investigated by the Chi square test and its prognostic value was determined by Kaplan–Meier survival curve analysis and Cox proportional hazards analysis. RNA interference and in vitro functional experiments, including cell viability, migration, and invasion, were used to investigate effects of SH3PXD2A-AS1 on cell malignant phenotype. RESULTS: SH3PXD2A-AS1 expression was increased in ESCC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. A high level of SH3PXD2A-AS1 expression was associated with poor tumor differentiation and advanced T, N, and TNM stages, indicating its oncogenic role in ESCC. Moreover, its high expression predicted poor overall survival in patients with ESCC. Inhibition of SH3PXD2A-AS1 expression significantly suppressed cell viability, migration, and invasion of ESCC cells. CONCLUSION: High SH3PXD2A-AS1 expression is a poor prognostic factor for patients with ESCC. SH3PXD2A-AS1 might function as an oncogene that can promote malignant biological characteristics of ESCC cells.","Luo, Qiuli; Wang, Shanshan; Han, Haibo; Xie, Fei; Chen, Jinfeng",J Int Med Res,505,17

As a direct result, ideas, which would otherwise have never been considered, are being presented as golden solutions. One such case is that of the 'immunity passport', i.e. determining the movement of people within countries and across borders on the basis of their immunity status. The argument being made is that such a passport would allow people with immunity to help on the front line, as for example to alleviate pressure in hospitals safeguarding the health of many. Similar argumentation is used across sectors, with tremendous burden being placed on low-paid and seasonal workers, who may attempt to try and get infected to be 'able' to work or cross a border to seek work. Additionally, legislative provisions on testing for immunity expose individuals to enforced 'solutions' infringing upon their rights and privacy, and even stigmatising them. Thus, COVID19 represents a threat to human rights, individual freedoms and, ultimately, social cohesion, mostly impacting adversely vulnerable people already at a disadvantage. The legal nature of this measure raises questions on whether this is necessary and in accordance to a legitimate aim in a democratic society. Is there a difference between healthcare settings and the broader society? Who would manage 'immunity registries'? Could data safe and privacy safeguarded? Would human rights be infringed upon and with what implication for democracy? Vaccines are destined to become a catalyst in this debate. Currently, we do not know whether antibody presence translates to protection from subsequent infection, with uncertainty on antibody testing, response durability, and on the role of antibodies in conferring immunity. The same concerns are applicable to a future vaccine. Would it be acceptable to revisit the immunity passports in the advent of a vaccine? Where do we stand in terms of having a s! afe and effective vaccine? What is the role science can play to elucidate such dilemmas and inform policy? What role can patient summaries play were we to transition to recording immunity vs vaccination status? Immunity passports represent a Trojan horse to compromise democratic societies and exacerbate inequalities, also representing an impediment to empowerment. Safe care can be ensured by saying no to immunity passports and yes to citizen empowerment, with patient summaries associated with provenance and including immunization information for safe care. The principal objectives of the workshop are to a. examine assumptions and implications on immunity passports in a comprehensive manner, and b. inform on the need of evidence-informed dialogue to safeguard human rights, as well as global public health. Following four 10-min presentations, the Panel and the Chairs will enter a 20-min discussion. The audience will be able to respond to key propositions and ask questions through an interactive element. KEY MESSAGES: Interdisciplinary scientific dialogue is key to assess proposed solutions and the implications thereof for evidence-informed policymaking safeguarding human rights and global public health alike.

A large number of neurosurgical patients with less than emergency conditions had their surgery postponed indefinitely. METHODS: The Delphi method was used to obtain consensus. Twenty-two neurosurgeons actively practicing in two separate geographic regions of the United States where “black level” COVID-19 surges occurred (New York Metropolitan Area and Detroit, Michigan) participated. A total of 86 neurosurgical case scenarios were categorized into six tiers of priority: emergent or within 24 hours, within 48 hours, within 1 week, within 2 weeks, within one month, or post hospital crisis/more than 4 weeks. Consensus was defined as 75% of participants reaching an agreement. Majority opinion (>50% agreement) was also reported. RESULTS: 67 of the 86 surgical scenarios (78%) reached a consensus agreement with 85 out of 86 scenarios reaching at least a majority opinion. Only one scenario (central cord syndrome) did not reach any agreement. CONCLUSION: The NNPI developed in this study can assist neurosurgical departments in prioritizing the timing of surgery, whether it be due to a pandemic, or any other scenario where the normal work flow has been severely disrupted and resources are limited.","Thomas, Justin G; Gandhi, Shashank V; White, Timothy G; Jocelyn, Christian; Soo, Teck M; Eisenberg, Mark B; Schulder, Michael; Narayan, Raj K",Neurosurgery,505,24

Although greater age is a risk factor for greater COVID-19 disease severity, we know little about the association between age and perceived and experienced COVID-19 threats and their association to well-being. These associations were examined in an ongoing 3-wave investigation of over 1,700 U.S. adults (age 18-89; 53.1% female). Wave 1 analyses indicate no significant age variation in perceived threat of COVID-19 infection, with older and younger individuals reporting similar levels of COVID-19 infection threat. However, greater age was associated with lower perceived negative impact on financial and needed resources (r=-.10**), lower perceptions of COVID-19 induced harm to mental well-being (r=-.17**), and more favorable well-being profiles. Greater perceived COVID-19 threat and negative impact on resources and well-being were linked to greater feelings of stress (β’s=.45 to .68***), loneliness (β’s=.24 to .49***), social well-being (β’s=-.19 to -.36***), and poor sleep quality (β’s=.34 to .51***). These associations did not vary with age with the exception that older individuals showed stronger links between COVID-19 threat and impacts and poorer sleep quality. Ongoing analyses are examining whether these associations persist over time.

Objectives: Our study aimed to develop and validate machine-learning models to dynamically predict the risk of SIC in critically ill patients with sepsis. Methods: Machine-learning models were developed and validated based on two public databases named Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV and the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD). Dynamic prediction of SIC involved an evaluation of the risk of SIC each day after the diagnosis of sepsis using 15 predictive models. The best model was selected based on its accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), followed by fine-grained hyperparameter adjustment using the Bayesian Optimization Algorithm. A compact model was developed, based on 15 features selected according to their importance and clinical availability. These two models were compared with Logistic Regression and SIC scores in terms of SIC prediction. Results: Of 11,362 patients in MIMIC-IV included in the final cohort, a total of 6,744 (59%) patients developed SIC during sepsis. The model named Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) had the greatest AUC in our study (0.869; 95% CI: 0.850–0.886). Coagulation profile and renal function indicators were the most important features for predicting SIC. A compact model was developed with an AUC of 0.854 (95% CI: 0.832–0.872), while the AUCs of Logistic Regression and SIC scores were 0.746 (95% CI: 0.735–0.755) and 0.709 (95% CI: 0.687–0.733), respectively.

Du Bois-Reymond and López Blasco suggested almost 20 years ago that ‘youth is now […] a life condition that is marked by unpredictability, vulnerability and reversibility’ (2003, p. 20). This situation has only accelerated since then. This paper draws on the authors’ research in the UK, France and Australia to consider how university students imagine a future that is essentially unknowable. At the time of the authors’ interviews, this future included conditions of vulnerability within the living social present that extended into the anticipated future and that ranged from the local to the global in their origins and impact. These conditions have since been even further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the global recession accompanying it.

The aim of the paper is to determine challenges related to criticality and environmental impacts of battery electric vehicles and internal combustion engine vehicles, focusing not only on a global but also the Chinese perspective, applying the ESSENZ method, which covers a unique approach to determine criticality aspects as well as integrating life cycle assessment results. Real industry data for vehicles and batteries produced in China was collected. Further, for the criticality assessment, Chinese import patterns are analyzed. The results show that the battery electric vehicle has similar and partly increased environmental impacts compared with the internal combustion engine vehicle. For both, the vehicle cycle contributes to a large proportion in all the environmental impact categories except for global warming. Further, battery electric vehicles show a higher criticality than internal combustion engine vehicles, with tantalum, lithium, and cobalt playing essential roles. In addition, the Chinese-specific results show a lower criticality compared to the global assessment for the considered categories trade barriers and political stability, while again tantalum crude oil and cobalt have high potential supply disruptions. Concluding, battery electric vehicles still face challenges regarding their environmental as well as criticality performance from the whole supply chain both in China and worldwide. One reason is the replacement of the lithium-ion power battery. By enhancing its quality and establishing battery recycling, the impacts of battery electric vehicle would decrease.

The data analysed in this paper specifically refer to the cities of Helsinki (Finland), Tallinn (Estonia), Kongsberg (Norway), and Gdańsk (Poland). Across all cities, passengers provided remarkably positive feedback regarding personal security and safety onboard. The overall feedback, which was very positive in general, showed statistically significant differences across the groups of cities (Kongsberg, Helsinki, Tallinn and Gdansk), partially explicable by the differences in the route design. In addition, across all cities and feedback topics, males gave a lower score compared to females. The overall rating suggests that there is a demand for future last-mile automated services that could be integrated with the MaaS concept, although demand changes according to socio-economic and location-based conditions across different countries.

Therefore, thirty-three scientific articles were selected to answer the three research questions posed on this study. In addition to the results, it was determined that the use of predetermined time systems are instruments that allow the quantification of a job before executing its production. Indeed, it allows the combination of techniques to develop predetermined systems that are linked to a specific activity.

In this way, the implementation of good practices for sustainable soil management are essential to reverse their tendency to degradation as preventive measures and so, guarantee food security and protect the provision of different ecosystem services associated with the soil. The advent of the Sentinel and Landsat satellite programs provide free data sets with good spatial and temporal resolution that can be a valuable source of information for monitoring pasture resources. In order to evaluate this type of techniques, a time series (TS) was generated with images of the Landsat 8 (L8) OLI (Operational Land Imager) sensor and a time series with images of the Sentinel-2 (S2), MSI (Multispectral Imager) sensor to determine the best results in the quantification of changes in the coverage of pastures at the Santa Mónica farm. In this study, pastures were analyzed using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series obtained from median quarterly mosaics obtained in 2019. Different samples were drawn that represent the change trend throughout the time series and were classified according to their degree of change and persistence in the series. The results indicate that the densification of the time series allows to provide better results in the quantification of the changes and dynamics of the coverage. The established methodology represents a great advance on the generation of images and the monitoring and detection of changes in coverage through time series [22]. Hence, it is one the first studies carried out in the country that incorporate this type of process. It was concluded that the determination of spectral signatures with the index used together with the near infrared (NIR) and short wave infrared (SWIR 1) spectral bands, allow to extract values and intervals where the change produced by pastures is identified with an acceptable level of accuracy.","Fernando, Garrido; Víctor, Caranqui",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,505,24

Why compare them? First of all, to distance ourselves from the supposed exceptionality of the French prefect’s Napoleonic model. Indeed, the prefectoral institution has been widely exported beyond historical and political configurations (nineteenth–twenty-first centuries) and various types of State (centralised, decentralised, regionalised, federal, federated). Our inventory of meso-level governments and centre-periphery relations in Europe shows that there are chief territorial administrators in most European countries, bearing various titles: prefects, governors, delegates of the government, commissioners. To conceptually capture what they have in common despite their differences, we propose a Weberian ideal-type of the ‘prefectoral figure’, as a stylised portrait of the actual territorial representatives of the State, with three variants: the ‘career prefect’, ‘functional prefect’ and ‘dignified prefect’. Comparing these officials helps to better comprehend—in discussion with policy transfer studies—how administrative models circulate between countries. Refuting the oversimplified ‘institutional mimetism’ thesis, we show how the prefectoral institution/role has been circulating in Europe through a complex intertwining of transplantations, transpositions, propagations, dialogue, adaptations and acclimatisations.","Tanguy, Gildas; Eymeri-Douzans, Jean-Michel","Prefects, Governors and Commissioners",505,16

However, the exact timing constraints of the system are often uncertain during the design phase. Consequently, the designer is able to build a TA with a correct structure, however, the timing constraints need to be tuned to make the TA comply with the specification. In this work, we assume that we are given a TA together with an existential property, such as reachability, that is not satisfied by the TA. We propose a novel concept of a minimal sufficient reduction (MSR) that allows us to identify the minimal set S of timing constraints of the TA that needs to be tuned to meet the specification. Moreover, we employ mixed-integer linear programming to actually find a tuning of S that leads to meeting the specification.","Bendík, Jaroslav; Sencan, Ahmet; Gol, Ebru Aydin; Černá, Ivana",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,505,1

We take a language-theoretic perspective and show general decidability and undecidability results for asynchronous programs that capture all known results as well as show decidability of new and important classes. As a main consequence, we show decidability of safety, termination and boundedness verification for higher-order asynchronous programs—such as OCaml programs using Lwt—and undecidability of liveness verification already for order-2 asynchronous programs. We show that under mild assumptions, surprisingly, safety and termination verification of asynchronous programs with handlers from a language class are decidable iff emptiness is decidable for the underlying language class. Moreover, we show that configuration reachability and liveness (fair termination) verification are equivalent, and decidability of these problems implies decidability of the well-known “equal-letters” problem on languages.

Data analysis assumes a key role, as does arithmetic, which, together with data science, permits us to have a top to bottom comprehension of the subtleties of nature and how things are made. As in the previous years, the pioneers of data science have had a mind-blowing effect on the reality where information and examination have been utilized to drive critical change throughout the spread of the sickness. One of the primary recorded uses of information examination was in 1852, during a cholera episode in London. John Snow, one of the primary information-driven disease transmission specialists, had the option to geospatially examine the passing that happened in London and in this manner segregate the wellspring of the infection. Depending on his investigation, specialists had the option to focus on their interventions to quickly check the spread of the pandemic.

It is very important to understand where an organization is located and what level of maturity in lean management it has reached so far. Setting up football tables or expanding break rooms in creative leisure zones will not ensure overnight or even years that a hierarchical company with traditional leadership will become a modern flagship company for agility, self-organization or new work. In addition to managers, employees must also be open to changes as the lean management cultures empower employees with freedom and choice within a set environment. Coupling the meaning and the exchange on an equal footing is crucial to promote acceptance and identification, otherwise there will be a lack of understanding and lack of interest among managers, employees and stakeholders (Helmold, 2020). Lean management is therefore a modern concept for new work and process optimization in the own organization and the entire the value chain (Helmold & Samara, 2019). Lean management is focusing on making inefficiencies (waste) transparent and on altering these into value-adding activities (Helmold & Terry 2016; Ohno, 1990). The value chain reaches in this context from the upstream (Suppliers) over the own operations to the downstream side (Customers) (Slack, 1995). Inefficiencies are everything, e.g. an activity, a process, a product, which is considered as something for which the customers are not willing to pay for or to spend financial means. The customer is the central point in the lean management concept. The primary objectives in the lean management philosophy are to create value for the customer through the optimization of resources and create a steady workflow based on real customer demands (Ohno, 1990). It seeks to eliminate any waste of time, effort or money by identifying each step in a business process and then revising or cutting out steps that do not create value (Bertagnolli, 2018).

Each patient will also have predictable morbidity associated with their underlying pathological process, and for this reason they are cared for by specialist transplant teams. Extensive investigation is important in patients presenting for transplantation and where possible optimization of conditions such as anaemia can be made preoperatively. Heart Transplantation: Increasing numbers of patents are in-patients in critical care areas and are receiving inotrope infusions pre-operatively. Internationally, 43% of patients receive Mechanical Circulatory Support (MCS) at the time of transplant. The most commonly used method is Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) support. The principles of anesthesia for other types of cardiac surgery apply and many different anesthetic agents and techniques have been used. The technique of choice varies according to individual transplant centers. There is no evidence that any one technique leads to a better outcome than any other. Lung Transplantation: Lung transplantation is, in fact, a group of operative procedures comprising single-lung transplant, bilateral sequential lung transplant, lobar transplant and en-block heart-lung transplantation. Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is the commonest cause of post-operative mortality and occurs in 10–57% of patients. Its presentation is analogous to ARDS, and the principles of management are similar. Liver Transplantation: Liver transplantation is the sole definitive treatment for end-stage liver disease. There are many systemic changes associated with liver disease that make the management of patients with ESLD challenging peri-operatively. Cardiopulmonary events are the leading cause of non-graft related deaths in liver transplant. Renal Transplantation: Renal transplants are the treatment of choice for end stage renal failure (ESRF). The procedure is carried out in many centres and are predominantly cadaveric renal transplants. However, Live donor Transplants numbers are increasing. Patients receiving renal transplants show an almost immediate improvement in quality of life, morbidity, and mortality compared with dialysis. Patients are usually dialysed prior to theatre, causing hypovolemia which may be exaggerated by general anesthesia. Pancreatic Transplantation: Successful pancreatic transplant provides durable glycemic control and improves survival for patients with diabetes. Diabetic patients are more at risk of peri-operative complications including infection and poor wound healing. In the USA there has been a decline in pancreas transplants over the last decade. Postoperative Care: Postoperative care is vital to ensure the viability of the newly transplanted graft. Continued optimization of hemodynamic stability and oxygen delivery means the patient must be cared for in the appropriate environment, which usually mandates level 2 or 3 critical care depending on the level of organ support required. Conclusion: The anesthetic management of patients presenting for organ transplantation is challenging yet rewarding.","Milligan, Amanda; Nath, Andrew; Pace, Nick; Logan, Neil",Transplantation Surgery,505,7

Purdie-Irvine alkylation, using silver oxide, produces with 90% yield the esters of the NBA building block for iso-butyl ether electrets. It warrants additional ester hydrolysis for obtaining the desired NBA precursor. Conversely, Williamson etherification selectively produces the same free-acid ether derivative in one-pot reaction, but a 40% yield. The high yields of Purdie-Irvine alkylation and the selectivity of the Williamson etherification provide important guidelines for synthesizing building blocks for bioinspired molecular electrets and a wide range of other complex ether conjugates.","Derr, James Bennett; Rybicka-Jasińska, Katarzyna; Espinoza, Eli Misael; Morales, Maryann; Billones, Mimi Karen; Clark, John Anthony; Vullev, Valentine Ivanov",Biomolecules,505,24

Rarely, macroprolactinomas may invade the sphenoid sinus and pose a therapeutic challenge, as treatment with dopamine agonists and subsequent tumor shrinkage can lead to a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. Clinical Case: A 32-year-old female with no prior medical history presented to the emergency room of an outside hospital for headaches and visual changes. MRI demonstrated a 4.3 x 4.0 x 3.0 cm sellar mass with extension into the right cavernous sinus and sphenoid sinus, and prolactin was elevated to 1,859 ng/ml (3.4 - 21.4). Cabergoline was initiated at a dose of 0.25 mg twice a week with a decrease in her prolactin to 646 ng/ml one month later. Six months after initiation of therapy she transferred her care to our institution and presented for a routine endocrinology visit. She complained of rhinorrhea worse when upright that had begun two weeks prior to this encounter. Urgent MRI of the sella revealed an interval decrease in the size of the sellar mass to 2.1 x 2.7 x 1.5 cm and a fluid collection extending from the sella turcica to the left sphenoid sinus consistent with a CSF leak, and labs showed a prolactin level of 169 ng/ml. Cabergoline was discontinued and the patient was admitted to the hospital for treatment with antibiotics and acetazolamide. She underwent lumbar drain placement while awaiting definitive surgical management, which was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While off cabergoline, the sellar mass increased in size and her prolactin rose to 1,449 ng/ml, with no effect on the optic chiasm and visual fields. Three months later, she underwent transsphenoidal debulking of the pituitary mass with repair of the sellar floor and removal of lumbar drain. Her postoperative course was uncomplicated and she resumed cabergoline 0.25 mg twice weekly. A prolactin measured two weeks postoperatively was 337 ng/ml. Tumor histopathology revealed a 1.3 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm pituitary adenoma. Immunohistochemistry stained positive for chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and prolactin only. An MRI of the sella and prolactin level will be repeated at her next endocrinology visit. Conclusions: CSF leak is a rare but serious complication from tumor shrinkage after medical management of large invasive prolactinomas, and patients with such tumors should be monitored closely for its development. CSF leaks can increase a patient’s risk for meningitis and subsequent morbidity and mortality. The management of patients with large prolactinomas with local invasion should involve a multidisciplinary approach for decision making, extensive patient education, and close follow up in order to identify and treat a CSF leak should it develop.","Pechman, Amanda; Manavalan, Anjali; Kishore, Preeti",J Endocr Soc,505,10

In addition to being a communication disorder, stuttering is often accompanied by a reduction in the quality of life and has impacts on social status, mental well-being, self-acceptance, and the chances of integration into the labor market. The Inquiry Based Stress Reduction (IBSR) program, developed in the United States by Byron Katie in 1986, is the clinical application of “The Work” method (Thework.com) and represents an emerging mindfulness and cognitive-reframing method. IBSR has been demonstrated to improve mental health and well-being in adults and may alleviate psychological and psychosocial symptoms of stuttering. The purpose of this trial was to examine the effect of a 12-week IBSR intervention on the overall stuttering experience and indicators of anxiety, psychological flexibility, and well-being among adults who stutter (AWS). This study was a randomized controlled clinical trial. Participants were randomized to IBSR (n = 28) and control (n = 28) groups. Validated questionnaires of overall stuttering experience (OASES-A), anxiety (STAI), psychological flexibility (PFQ), and satisfaction with life (SWLS) were completed before, after, and one month after the intervention. An intention-to-treat approach was implemented for analysis. Our results show that participants in the IBSR intervention group exhibited a greater improvement in their overall stuttering experience as compared to the control group, as well as in general information on stuttering awareness and perception, reactions to stuttering, communication in daily situations, and quality of life. In addition, we found a greater reduction in anxiety levels and an increase in satisfaction-with-life scores in the IBSR group. These results indicate that IBSR can improve the overall stuttering experience.","Feldman, Omrit; Goldstien, Eran; Rolnik, Benjamin; Ganz, Ariel B.; Lev-Ari, Shahar",J Clin Med,505,1

Although the massive prophylactic vaccination campaign is the best global solution that may bring an end to the pandemic, a certain proportion of the population seems to remain reluctant to it. No specific data for IBD patients is yet available. We aimed to assess prevalence and characteristics of IBD patients with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. METHODS: Adult IBD patients treated in our centre were invited to fulfil anonymous online survey from January 17(th) to February 25(th), 2021. Participants’ characteristics were assessed using descriptive statistics. Normal distribution was assessed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests. Continuous variables were compared with independent t-test and Mann–Whitney test when appropriate. Categorical variables were analyzed using the Chi-square test. RESULTS: A total of 120 subjects (43.3% female, mean age 34.5±12.3 years, 56.7% Crohn’s disease) completed the survey with a response rate of 96%. Median of disease duration was 8 years (IQR 3–12 years) and 65.8% of participants were on biologics. Overall, only 51.7% were willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Mean age of subjects who were inclined to vaccination was higher compared to those who are not (38.1 vs 30.4 years), t(118)=3.43, p=.001. There wasn’t statistically significant difference in median of disease duration between these two groups U=1551, N1=58, N2=62, p=.194, two-tailed. Mean BMI was higher in group of patients who were willing to get vaccinated (25.4 vs 23.2 kg/m(2)) t(111.67)=2.94, p=.004. There was no difference in vaccine acceptance between IBD patients who identified themselves as a high-risk group and the other which didn’t. Also, acceptability of a COVID-19 vaccine in IBD patients with or without comorbidities didn’t differ significantly (χ (2) (1, N = 120) = .52, p < .47). Connection between biologic use and willingness to vaccination wasn’t observed (χ (2) (1, N = 120) = 2.06, p < .15). Reported reasons for COVID-19 vaccine unacceptability were belief that vaccine can’t be safe because of its rapid development (55%), fear from possible interaction between IBD therapy and vaccine (44%), and fear that vaccine may lead to disease flare (36%). CONCLUSION: A high proportion of Croatian IBD patients are unwilling to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Further patient education, motivation strategies and positive vaccination campaign by gastroenterologists are warranted. Those could be the most significant factors in driving the compliance to COVID-19 vaccination and in reducing IBD patient’s hesitancy to get vaccinated.","Tomasic, V; Bišćanin, A; Ćaćić, P; Kralj, D; Dorosulić, Z; Ogresta, D; Hrabar, D",J Crohns Colitis,505,1

This deficit takes up a heuristic of media use, which among other things considers the deep structure of media use. In this article first indications for such didactic potential of media are presented. By comparing different exemplary media between biology, chemistry, and physics, earlier results, e.g for hardware, are extended. The availability and use of models and digital media are examined.

Findings from a qualitative study are presented to explore how recipients of food assistance benefits, enrolled in community college make decisions about voting. Data collected provides rich and contextual insight into how the decision to vote or not vote corresponds with an academic understanding of political empowerment and suggests that choosing not to vote may represent a type of political empowerment. Social work interventions related to voting for this population could include reducing stigma around government assistance, voter engagement, and work with systems to recognize the political power of those who are often left out of the process.","Sandler, Adelaide K.; Lane, Shannon R.",J of Pol Practice & Research,505,1

The redesign of both consumer commodity goods and advanced products may not only require engineering feats in terms of advanced structures but also the implementation of safer and more facile to recycle materials. Although such endeavours include the engineering of goods generated from clever components assemblies, easier to dismantle and separate, new avenues to move beyond planned obsolescence towards triggered obsolescence, whereby materials may degrade on command, is required. Circular Materials must be designed to enable complete recycling of materials and novel synthesis strategies free from toxic precursors or by-products to regenerate raw materials. Circular materials shall therefore be processed first at the local level for local needs. Key supply-chain challenges arising from the COVID-19 lockdowns have further stressed the relevance of this issue and the need to have develop well dispatched geographically manufacturing hubs. Changes towards Circular Materials considerations will depend on the development of repurposing and recycling platforms as well as from the rebirth of delocalized manufacturing capabilities.

Eliminating cervical cancer in China is a huge challenge, with application of the HPV vaccine, which is an important part. METHODS: There are currently four HPV vaccines available in China: E-coli bv-HPV (Wantai, China), bv-HPV, qv-HPV (GSK, UK), and 9v-HPV (MSD, USA). To observe the immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety of these four vaccines in China, we formed the ""Chinese Expert Consensus on the Clinical Application of HPV Vaccine."" RESULTS: At 7 months after vaccination, all vaccinated subjects had the same immunogenic response to either HPV16 or HPV18, ranging from 96 to 100%, and antibody production in girls aged 9–14 years was 2–3 times higher than that in adult women. Efficacy of the four vaccines against CIN2 + ranged from 87.3% to 100%, with prevention of HPV-associated infection reaching 96% ~ 97% at 12 months. Clinical trials showed bv-HPV and qv-HPV vaccine were also safe in women aged 18–45 years. Clinical trials of the 9v-HPV vaccine are underway. HPV vaccination is currently voluntary and self-paid in China. The ""Chinese Expert Consensus on the Clinical Application of HPV Vaccine"" will work to promote the application of HPV vaccine in China. CONCLUSIONS: In clinical studies, the available HPV vaccines showed excellent efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity in Chinese women. We will continue strengthening screening and encouraging HPV vaccination.","Wei, Lihui; Xie, Xing; Liu, Jihong; Qiao, Youlin; Zhao, Fanghui; Wu, Ting; Zhang, Jun; Ma, Ding; Kong, Beihua; Chen, Wen; Zhao, Chao; Zhao, Yun; Li, Jingran; Li, Mingzhu; Xia, Ningshao",Indian J Gynecol Oncol,505,24

This transformation included changes in students’ contact hours, the use of technologies in classroom and laboratories, and the implementation of active self‐directed learning. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of these pedagogical changes on students’ academic and mental states. To achieve this goal, we proposed two questions: First question was to examine whether there was a difference between male and female students’ exam grades in the brain and behavior module during the COVID‐19 lockdown. In the second question, we examined whether there was a difference between students’ stress level in all age groups (22‐24), (25‐28) and 29 and above during the pandemic lockdown. This study employed a between‐subject design and utilized convenience sampling technique to include 79 first‐year medical students. The present study included the following variables: students module final exam grades, students’ perception about their stress levels during COVID‐19 and their age groups (22‐24), (25‐28) and 29 and above. We first used a comparison design between male and female students’ academic performance during COVID‐19. Further, we used a comparison design to compare between students’ stress level in all age groups (22‐24), (25‐28) and 29 and above during the pandemic lockdown. In the first question, the result of the one‐way between subject's ANOVA found that there was no statistically significant difference between male and female student’ grades in the brain and behavior module during the pandemic lockdown. These findings suggest that both male and female students were able to overcome many of the challenges triggered by the COVID‐19 in the learning environment and succeed in this module. In the second question, the one‐way between subject's ANOVA found that there was no statistically significant difference between students’ stress level in all age groups (22‐24), (25‐28) and 29 and above during the pandemic lockdown. These findings suggest that students in all ages felt the same level of stress during the COVID‐19 lockdown. We concluded that there was no difference in students’ final grades during pandemic, regardless of their gender, where all students maintained a high level of academic success. Additionally, students in all age groups were subjected to the same level of stress during COVID‐19. With the faculty help and guidance, students were able to adjust and counterbalance the missing elements of the face‐to‐face instruction during COVID‐19.","Syed, Mohsin; Akhter, Noor; Ibrahim, Mohamed; Stanley, Laura",FASEB J,505,16

The Rohingya refugee crisis, resulting from systematic state atrocities towards a stateless community, has resulted in a massive wave of forced migration to neighbouring Bangladesh. Subsequently, the large number of refugees is exerting enormous pressure on the economy of this developing nation. The crisis can be understood from the perspectives of both human concerns and Bangladesh’s traditional security concerns. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic is bringing additional challenges. This study investigates and examines the nature of the dilemma faced by the Bangladesh government in its foreign policy strategy over the Rohingya refugee crisis. It is argued that Bangladesh is facing dual challenges from the national and human security perspectives, and that the regional interests of major players, such as India, China, Russia and Japan, are determining the country’s policy stance. It is also argued that the plight of the Rohingya people through their statelessness has become less decisive in the major powers’ diplomatic calculations. The findings suggest that Bangladesh should accentuate its efforts to internationalise the issue and engage in a vigilant balancing between the major players for the repatriation of refugees, while, at the same time, exerting bilateral pressure on Myanmar.","Rahman, Mohammad Sajedur; Sakib, Nurul Huda",SN Soc Sci,505,24

Immune and non-immune cells produce the IL-37 precursor upon pro-inflammatory stimuli. Intracellularly, caspase-1 cleaves and activates IL-37, and its mature form binds to Smad3; this complex translocates into the nucleus where it suppresses cytokine production, consequently reducing inflammation. Extracellularly, IL-37 forms a complex with IL-18Rα and IL-1R8 (formerly TIR8 or SIGIRR) that transduces anti-inflammatory signals by the suppression of NF-κB and MAPK and the activation of Mer-PTEN-DOK pathways. During inflammation, IL-37 suppresses the expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokine in favor to the expression of the anti-inflammatory ones by the regulation of macrophage polarization, lipid metabolism, inflammasome function, TSLP synthesis and miRNAs function. Moreover, IL-37 not only regulates the innate and acquired immunity, but also improves aging-associated immunosenescence. Furthermore, IL-37 exerts an inhibitory effect on tumor angiogenesis and metastasis, and progression. Finally, IL-37 may have a potential ability to reduce excessive inflammation since it is aberrantly expressed in patients with inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, and cancer, thus, it may be used as a marker for different types of diseases. Therefore, this review provides an updated view of the role of IL-37 in human health and disease, and discusses the potential of IL-37 as a therapeutic target and biomarker in inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.","Su, Zhangci; Tao, Xiaoan",Front Immunol,505,22

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review with telephone interview. SETTING: Single tertiary care center. METHODS: Patients with a sporadic vestibular schwannoma and started on observational surveillance management between January 2005 and December 2010 were included. Demographic data, tumor size, hearing and vestibular changes, and follow-up length were recorded. Patient factors were analyzed for association with being lost to follow-up. RESULTS: In total, 122 patients were included with a median length of follow-up of 5 months (range, 0-146). After initial surveillance, 22.1% (n = 27) of patients had a change in management to either microsurgery or radiosurgery. Of the remaining 77.9% (n = 95), nearly half (44.2%, n = 42) never returned for a second visit, and all but 3 were eventually lost to follow-up. There was no association between sex, race, age at diagnosis, initial tumor size, insurance status, household income, or driving distance to hospital and being lost to follow-up. Of 26 interviewed patients initially lost to follow-up, 11 (42.3%) sought care at another institution, 5 (19.2%) chose to no longer receive care, 1 (3.8%) had transportation difficulties, and 9 (36.4%) had poor understanding of their diagnosis or instructions. CONCLUSIONS: The length of follow-up for patients undergoing surveillance of sporadic vestibular schwannoma varies widely, and patients are commonly lost to follow-up.

This paper settles on this pause and uncertainty to seek new approaches to prepare social work students for changing conditions. Long-standing questions re-surface in relation to social, economic, political and environmental structures and conditions that are located in a neoliberal framework. The paper explores challenges and opportunities facing educators and social work students through a core set of principles—critical, relational and connected—that underpin our community development pedagogy. Within these themes, we explore teaching practices which seek to create a ‘Community of Learners’, generate a process of collaborative critical inquiry, engage students in reflective praxis enriched by contemporary theory and research, and foster a deep, connected and adaptive perspective on global and local issues. This stimulates creativity and meets the need for critical and adaptable practitioners capable of practical action through this period of disruption and crises of governance, climate and technologies of the future.","Lynch, Deborah; Lathouras, Athena; Forde, Catherine",Community Dev J,505,0

Rates of minor, ""nuisance"" bleeding in these patients remain unknown. We sought to evaluate the frequency and factors associated with this bleeding and its effect on DAPT compliance. METHODS We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study on consecutive cases of intracranial aneurysms treated with PED. Patient characteristics, aneurysm characteristics, and bleeding complications were analyzed. Severity of bleeding was defined according to a previously published classification defining nuisance bleeding as easy bruising, bleeding from small cuts, petechia, and ecchymosis. RESULTS 245 PED aneurysm procedures on 243 patients were retrospectively collected from three academic centers over a 4.25-year period. Sixty-seven patients (27%) had nuisance bleeds. Patients with a higher risk of nuisance bleeding were older (59.1±3.4 vs . 54.7±2.2, P=0.032). Patients with nuisance bleeds were more likely to have their DAPT regimen changed or dose lowered (29% vs 8.3%, P<0.001), were on DAPT for less time (10.0 months±2.60 vs. 14.6 months±1.95, P=0.005) and were more likely to have aneurysm occlusion at 6 months (P<0.001). Stepwise logistic regression found age predictive of a nuisance bleed (OR=1.033) CONCLUSIONS: Nuisance bleeding was a common complaint of PED-treated aneurysm patients maintained on DAPT. Increasing age and aneurysmal occlusion at 6 months were the only factors predictive of nuisance bleeds. Clinicians were more likely to adjust antiplatelet regimens or stop DAPT early given a nuisance bleed.","Pressman, Elliot; De la Garza, Carlos A; Chin, Felix; Fishbein, Jacob; Waqas, Muhammad; Siddiqui, Adnan; Snyder, Kenneth; Davies, Jason M; Levy, Elad; Kan, Peter; Ren, Zeguang; Mokin, Maxim",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,505,31

Failed PIVC insertion are an under-recognized clinical phenomenon. OBJECTIVE To provide a scoping review of decision aids for PIVC insertion including tools, clinical prediction rules, and algorithms (TRAs) and their findings on factors associated with insertion success. METHODS In June 2016, a systematic literature search was performed using the medical subject heading of peripheral catheterization and tool* or rule* or algorithm*. Data extraction included clinician, patient, and/or product variables associated with PIVC insertion success. Information about TRA reliability, validity, responsiveness, and utility was also extracted. RESULTS We screened 36 studies, and included 13 for review. Seven papers reported insertion success ranging from 61%-90% (4030 insertion attempts), 6 on validity, and 5 on reliability, with none reporting on responsiveness and utility. Failed insertions were associated with obesity (odds ratio [OR], 0.71-1.7; 2 studies) and smaller gauge PIVCs (OR, 6.4; 95% Confidence Interval [CI}, 3.4-11.9). Successful inser tions were associated with visible veins (OR, 0.87-3.63; 3 studies) or palpable veins (OR, 0.79-5.05; 3 studies) and inserters with greater procedural volume (OR, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.6-12.1) or who predicted that insertion would be successful (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.04-1.07). Definitions of insertion difficulty are heterogeneous such as time to insert to a number of failed attempts. CONCLUSIONS Few well-validated reliable TRAs exist for PIVC insertion. Patients would benefit from a validated, clinically pragmatic TRA that matches insertion difficulty with clinician competency.","Carr, Peter J; Higgins, Niall S; Cooke, Marie L; Rippey, James; Rickard, Claire M",Journal of hospital medicine,505,7

Dumping syndrome is an expected and desired part of the behavior modification caused by gastric bypass surgery; it can deter patients from consuming energy-dense food. In this study we assessed the role dumping has in weight loss and its relationship with the patient's eating behavior. METHODS Fifty patients who underwent gastric bypass between January 2008 and June 2008 were enrolled. Two questionnaires, the dumping syndrome questionnaire and the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ), were used to record the patients' responses. The diagnosis of dumping syndrome was based on the Sigstad scoring system, where a score of 7 and above was considered positive. TFEQ evaluated the patients' eating behavior under three scales: cognitive restraint, uncontrolled eating, and emotional eating. The results were analyzed with descriptive and parametric statistics where applicable. RESULTS The prevalence of dumping syndrome was 42 %, with 66.7 % of the subjects being women. The nondumpers were observed to have a greater mean decrease in body mass index than the dumpers at 1 and 2 years (18.5 and 17.8 vs. 14.4 and 13.7 respectively). There was no definite relationship between the presence of dumping syndrome and the eating behavior of the patient. However, the cognitive restraint scores, greater than 80 %, were associated with an average decrease in BMI of 19 and 20.8 at 1 and 2 years compared with 14.6 and 12.4 in those with scores less than 80 % (p = 0.01 and p = 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSION The presence of dumping syndrome after gastric bypass does not influence weight loss, though eating behaviors may directly influence it.","Banerjee, Ambar; Ding, Yi; Mikami, Dean J; Needleman, Bradley J",Surgical endoscopy,505,16

During cellular entry, the virus is internalized by macropinocytosis and trafficked through endosomes until fusion between the viral and an endosomal membrane is triggered, releasing the RNA genome into the cytoplasm. We found that while macropinocytotic uptake of filamentous EBOV viruslike particles (VLPs) expressing the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) occurs relatively quickly, VLPs only begin to enter the cytoplasm after a 30-min lag, considerably later than particles bearing the influenza hemagglutinin or GP from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, which enter through late endosomes (LE). For EBOV, the long lag is not due to the large size or unusual shape of EBOV filaments, the need to prime EBOV GP to the 19-kDa receptor-binding species, or a need for unusually low endosomal pH. In contrast, since we observed that EBOV entry occurs upon arrival in Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1)-positive endolysosomes (LE/Lys), we propose that trafficking to LE/Lys is a key rate-defining step. Additional experiments revealed, unexpectedly, that severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) S-mediated entry also begins only after a 30-min lag. Furthermore, although SARS does not require NPC1 for entry, SARS entry also begins after colocalization with NPC1. Since the only endosomal requirement for SARS entry is cathepsin L activity, we tested and provide evidence that NPC1(+) LE/Lys have higher cathepsin L activity than LE, with no detectable activity in earlier endosomes. Our findings suggest that both EBOV and SARS traffic deep into the endocytic pathway for entry and that they do so to access higher cathepsin activity. IMPORTANCE Ebola virus is a hemorrhagic fever virus that causes high fatality rates when it spreads from zoonotic vectors into the human population. Infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) causes severe respiratory distress in infected patients. A devastating outbreak of EBOV occurred in West Africa in 2014, and there was a significant outbreak of SARS in 2003. No effective vaccine or treatment has yet been approved for either virus. We present evidence that both viruses traffic late into the endocytic pathway, to NPC1(+) LE/Lys, in order to enter host cells, and that they do so to access high levels of cathepsin activity, which both viruses use in their fusion-triggering mechanisms. This unexpected similarity suggests an unexplored vulnerability, trafficking to NPC1(+) LE/Lys, as a therapeutic target for SARS and EBOV.","Mingo, Rebecca M; Simmons, James A; Shoemaker, Charles J; Nelson, Elizabeth A; Schornberg, Kathryn L; D'Souza, Ryan S; Casanova, James E; White, Judith M",Journal of virology,505,1

This study compared properties of fat grafts produced by differing methods and assessed volume retention of the grafted tissue in a nude mouse model. METHODS In phase I, fat was harvested by either suction-assisted lipoaspiration or ultrasound-assisted lipoaspiration and then filtered using two different pore sizes. Graft material was analyzed for average parcel size; relative oil, fat, and aqueous fractions; and stromal vascular fraction yield. Filtrands and filtrates were injected into athymic nude mice. In phase II, lipoaspirate harvested by suction-assisted lipoaspiration only was processed by centrifugation, cotton gauze rolling, or filtration, and then studied in a similar manner. RESULTS Fat harvested by ultrasound- and suction-assisted lipoaspiration had comparable stromal vascular fraction counts and graft retention in vivo. Ultrasound-assisted lipoaspiration released only slightly more oil than suction-assisted lipoaspiration; filtering with either 500- or 800-µm pore size effectively removed fluid and oil. Centrifugation, cotton-gauze rolling, and filtration also effectively removed fluid and oil. In vivo graft retention and stromal vascular fraction yield was highest with the cotton gauze method. Histologic analysis of all explants showed intact adipose tissue. CONCLUSIONS Ultrasound- and suction-assisted lipoaspiration yielded similar retention of fat grafts in a xenograft model. Processing with cotton gauze rolling may be best suited for grafting cosmetically sensitive areas of the body in which optimal retention is critical and lower total graft volumes are needed. Filtration and centrifugation both effectively removed fluid fractions and resulted in comparable graft retention, and are more feasible when larger volumes are required.","Fisher, Christine; Grahovac, Tara L; Schafer, Mark E; Shippert, Ron D; Marra, Kacey G; Rubin, J Peter",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,505,16

The PANI/ZnO nanocomposite has exhibited the enhanced photocatalytic activity which is ~9 fold higher in comparison to pristine ZnO nanoflowers and enhanced photocurrent density which is ~16 fold higher than the ZnO photoanode. Importantly, ~4 fold increment in the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) is exhibited by PANI/ZnO, than that of ZnO photoanode. The remarkably enhanced photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical performance of PANI/ZnO nanocomposite is attributed to the availability of more interfacial sites facilitated by the hierarchical ZnO nanoflowers, improved overall photoresponse due to its photosensitization with PANI and the resulting type-II heterojunction between them, which helps in the efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers at the interface.

METHODS This retrospective study evaluated 484 nonfocal renal biopsies performed with 18-gauge side-notch biopsy needles. Number of biopsy passes, serum creatinine, body mass index, needle type, transplant age, kidney size, diabetic status, and operator were evaluated as predictors of the number of biopsy passes. RESULTS Four hundred seventy-four biopsies (338 transplant, 136 native) were included with mean number of passes 2.87 (3.1 native vs 2.78 transplant; P = 0.002). Mean number of glomeruli yielded per pass was 6.9 (7.2 transplant vs 6.1 native; P = 0.0002) with 3 passes adequate for histological diagnosis in 84% of biopsies. Native kidney, increasing serum creatinine level, trainee biopsy operator, and use of a Temno needle were found to be independent predictors of having more than 3 biopsy passes on multivariate analysis. Age, sex, body mass index, diabetic status, and kidney size were not associated with the number of biopsy passes. CONCLUSIONS The success of a nonfocal renal biopsy has many influencing variables, and in the absence of an on-site electron microscopy technologist to immediately evaluate biopsy samples, 3 passes with an 18-gauge needle would be adequate in 84% of kidneys to achieve a histological diagnosis, with 2 passes needed for transplant kidneys to meet the Banff 97 criteria.","Goldstein, Mark A; Atri, Mostafa; O'Malley, Martin; Jacks, Lindsay; John, Rohan; Herzenberg, Andrew; Reich, Heather; Ghai, Sangeet",Journal of computer assisted tomography,505,30

Clinical suspicion is fundamental since it is an unusual entity with a progressive and often asymptomatic installation over a long period. The authors report a 70-year-old man with diabetic nephropathy who underwent a kidney transplant (KT) in August 2014 with good clinical evolution. No previous CMV infection or episodes of acute rejection were reported. Five years after transplant, he was admitted due to a reduced visual acuity of the left eye with seven days of evolution with associated hyperemia, without exudate. The ophthalmologic evaluation was compatible with acute necrosis of the retina and presumed associated with CMV infection. He had a progressive improvement after ganciclovir initiation. CMV retinitis is one of the most serious ocular complications in immune-suppressed individuals and can lead to irreversible blindness, and because of that, early diagnosis and treatment remains crucial in obtaining the best visual prognosis in affected patients. Secondary prophylaxis with ganciclovir is not consensual, neither is the safety of reintroducing the antimetabolite in these cases.","Silva, Filipa; Ficher, Klaus Nunes; Viana, Laila; Coelho, Inês; Rezende, Juliana Toniato; Wagner, Daniel; Vaz, Maria Lúcia; Foresto, Renato; Silva Junior, Helio Tedesco; Pestana, José Medina",Jornal brasileiro de nefrologia : 'orgao oficial de Sociedades Brasileira e Latino-Americana de Nefrologia,505,22

Several authors have highlighted the temporal consequence between SARS-CoV-2 and autoimmune diseases. In this case report we described a patient admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia with completely negative autoimmunity at admission who developed major pulmonary interstitial disease. During the hospitalization the weaning difficulties from oxygen led us to the repetition of autoimmunity pattern which became positive (both during hospitalization then after two months from dismission) with marked positivity for specific antibodies for myositis even after the patient's infectious healing. In the follow-up, the patient continued to have asthenia and muscle weakness despite steroid therapy. She is still in follow-up and will be further evaluated over time.

The rivers of the Great Basin (USA) have been particularly imperiled by nonnative species introductions and represent a valuable location to study the dietary trends of native and nonnative fishes in isolated, endorheic systems. We collected fish from 23 sites, spanning three Great Basin watersheds (Carson, Humboldt, and Bear Rivers) and two elevation categories (upland and lowland). Only a single species (speckled dace Rhinichthys osculus) occurred in both elevation zones. Diet item analyses of over 500 fish stomachs indicated significant dietary overlaps between native and nonnative fishes and detailed dietary selectivity for all species. This finding, along with the low species diversity observed in the region, suggests low dietary niche diversity, which could have the potential to amplify the competitive impacts of nonnatives on native species. In upland sites, nonnative trouts were the dominant invaders, while in lowland sites warm-water nonnatives were prevalent. The management implications we recommend based on our results urge for continued monitoring of water temperature and species occurrences to predict if dietary overlaps observed in this study are likely to change in the future.

This study aims to examine the histopathological changes in reproductive organs of goats immunized with killed vaccine of C. pseudotuberculosis. In this study, twenty four (24) clinically healthy bucks and does were divided into four groups A, B, C and D. Animals in groups A and B were immunized with 0.5 and 1% formalin killed vaccine, respectively; followed by a booster dose. After the booster dose of immunization, groups A, B and C were challenged with C. pseudotuberculosis at 106 cfu/ml. Goats in group D were immunize and unchallenged and left as control group. All C. pseudotuberculosis infected animals were euthanized humanely 12 weeks post-challenged. Tissue samples such as testes, epididymis, spermatic cord, penis, pituitary gland, mammary gland, vulva, vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tube and ovaries were collected for histopathology study. Microscopic examination of all tissues (testes, seminiferous tubules, spermatic cord, penile tissues and the pituitary gland) in the male reproductive organs of the bucks that were inoculated with 2 ml of 0.5% and 1.0% of C. pseudotuberculosis killed vaccine showed normal (animals inoculated with 1.0%) to mild (animals inoculated with 0.5%) histopathological changes when compared with those from group C which showed varying degrees of histopathological changes (p < 0.01) in their various tissues.

This study investigated whether MGIB is associated with the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), low-dose aspirin (LDA), thienopyridines, anticoagulants, and proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), and whether PPI use affects the interactions between MGIB and antithrombotic drugs. METHODS In this multicenter, hospital-based, case-control study, 400 patients underwent upper and lower endoscopy, 80 had acute overt MGIB and 320 had no bleeding and were matched for age and sex as controls (1:4). MGIB was additionally evaluated by capsule and/or double-balloon endoscopy, after excluding upper and lower GI bleeding. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) for MGIB risk were calculated using conditional logistic regression. To estimate the propensity score, we employed a logistic regression model for PPI use. RESULTS In patients with MGIB, mean hemoglobin level was 9.4 g/dL, and 28 patients (35%) received blood transfusions. Factors significantly associated with MGIB were chronic kidney disease (p<0.001), liver cirrhosis (p = 0.034), NSAIDs (p<0.001), thienopyridines (p<0.001), anticoagulants (p = 0.002), and PPIs (p<0.001). After adjusting for these factors, NSAIDs (AOR, 2.5; p = 0.018), thienopyridines (AOR, 3.2; p = 0.015), anticoagulants (AOR, 4.3; p = 0.028), and PPIs (AOR; 2.0; p = 0.021) were independently associated with MGIB. After adjusting for propensity score, the use of PPIs remained an independent risk factors for MGIB (AOR, 1.94; p = 0.034). No significant interactions were observed between PPIs and NSAIDs (AOR, 0.7; p = 0.637), LDA (AOR, 0.3; p = 0.112), thienopyridine (AOR, 0.7, p = 0.671), or anticoagulants (AOR, 0.5; p = 0.545). CONCLUSIONS One-third of patients with acute small intestinal bleeding required blood transfusion.

The consequences may be fatal, or result in lasting downstream organ damage. Therefore, assessment of endogenous fibrinolytic status in an individual may identify those at risk of occlusive thrombus formation and provide prognostic information. Arterial thrombi are more platelet-rich and more resistant to fibrinolysis than venous thrombi. Several recent studies using global tests of fibrinolysis in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) have shown that despite dual antiplatelet therapy, patients with impaired fibrinolytic status have an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events, compared to those with effective fibrinolytic function. Such data add significantly to the predictive value of established cardiovascular risk factors and conventional biomarkers. Most data reported have been obtained with the Global Thrombosis Test and the turbidimetric plasma clot lysis assay. A few small studies in patients with ischaemic stroke suggest a similar predictive role of fibrinolytic status assessment in these patients. Studies reporting an association between impaired fibrinolysis and future venous thrombotic events are limited, and in the form of case-control studies. Viscoelastic assays may have a role in the prediction of venous thromboembolic risk. Assays of fibrinolytic function should be used to obtain a more accurate risk of future thrombotic events, particularly in the setting of ACS. The availability of point-of-care tests helps facilitate this and should encourage future studies to assess personalised antithrombotic treatment combinations to optimise fibrinolytic status and reduce thrombosis risk.","Kanji, Rahim; Kubica, Jacek; Navarese, Eliano P; Gorog, Diana A",European journal of clinical investigation,505,1

Thus, the current study is an endeavor to prove our hypothesis that regulation of arsenate (AsV: 50, 100, and 150 mM) and arsenite (AsIII: 50, 100, and 150 μM) toxicity is time dependent (48-96 h) due to modulation in bio-accumulation pattern, AsA-GSH cycle, and non-enzymatic antioxidants in two paddy field cyanobacteria Nostoc muscorum ATCC27893 and Anabaena sp. PCC7120. After 48 h, reduction in growth associated with increased sensitivity index, As bio-accumulation, and oxidative stress was observed which further intensified after 96 h but the degree of damage was lesser than 48 h. It denotes a significant recovery in growth after 96 h which is correlated with decreased As bio-accumulation and oxidative stress due to increased efficiency of AsA-GSH cycle and non-enzymatic antioxidants. Both the species of As caused significant rise in oxidative biomarkers as evident by in -vitro analysis of O2·-, H2O2, and MDA equivalent contents despite appreciable rise in the activity antioxidative enzymes APX, DHAR, and GR. The study concludes that among both forms of arsenic, AsIII induced more toxic effect on growth by over-accumulating the ROS as evident by weak induction of AsA-GSH cycle to overcome the stress as compared to AsV. Further, with increasing the time exposure, apparent recovery was noticed with the lower doses of AsV, i.e., 50 and 100 mM and AsIII, i.e., 50 and 100 μM; however, the toxicity further aggravated with higher dose of both AsV and AsIII. Study proposes the deleterious impact of AsV and AsIII on cyanobacteria N. muscorum and Anabaena sp. but the toxicity was overcome by time-dependent recovery.","Patel, Anuradha; Tiwari, Sanjesh; Prasad, Sheo Mohan",Environmental science and pollution research international,505,5

This post-hoc analysis of data from the pivotal phase 3, prospective, open-label study of valrubicin evaluated the effects of patient characteristics and past treatments on the response to valrubicin. METHODS Enrolled patients had non-muscle-invasive CIS with or without concurrent papillary disease stage Ta and/or T1 for which papillary tumors had been resected before treatment, and had previously received ≥ 2 courses of IVe therapy (≥ 1 BCG course). Patients received a course of valrubicin, which consisted of 6 weekly IVe treatments of valrubicin (800 mg). Complete response was defined as no evidence of disease by urine cytology, cystoscopy, and biopsy at 3 and 6 months posttreatment. Patient characteristics, baseline urinary symptoms, and number and type of previous treatment courses and instillations were compared for complete versus nonresponders (including partial responders) to valrubicin. RESULTS Ninety patients enrolled; 87 patients with positive biopsy at initiation completed a valrubicin course and underwent the 3-month assessment. Five had missing data at 6 months. Of the remaining 82 patients, 18 demonstrated a complete response; 64 demonstrated partial or no response. For complete responders versus partial or nonresponders, differences in patient characteristics, baseline urinary symptoms, and number of previous courses or instillations of BCG or other types of treatment were not significant (P > 0.05). More complete responders had evidence of inflammation before or during valrubicin treatment (P = 0.005 vs nonresponders). CONCLUSIONS In these patients with BCG-refractory CIS, complete responders to valrubicin did not differ significantly from partial or nonresponders in the number of prior courses or instillations. The results suggest that therapy with valrubicin may be considered in appropriate candidates who have not responded to prior therapies. Cystectomy should be reconsidered when valrubicin treatment fails.","Steinberg, Gary D; Smith, Norm D; Ryder, Kevin; Strangman, Nicole M; Slater, Simon J",Postgraduate medicine,505,27

An initial rigid image-to-patient registration may not be optimal for the entire lung volume, as the lung tissue anatomy is likely to have shifted since the time of computer tomography (CT) acquisition. The accuracy of the initial rigid registration will also be affected throughout the procedure by breathing, coughing, patient movement and tissue displacements due to pressure from bronchoscopy tools. A method to minimize the negative impact from these factors by updating the registration locally during the procedure is needed and suggested in this paper. METHODS The intraoperative local registration method updates the initial registration by optimization in an area of special interest, for example, close to a biopsy position. The local registration was developed through an adaptation of a previously published registration method used for the initial registration of CT to the patient anatomy. The method was tested in an experimental breathing phantom setup, where respiratory movements were induced by a robotic arm. Deformations were also applied to the phantom to see if the local registration could compensate for these. RESULTS The local registration was successfully applied in all 15 repetitions, five in each of the three parts of the airway phantom. The mean registration accuracy was improved from 11.8-19.4 mm to 4.0-6.7 mm, varying to some degree in the different segments of the airway model. CONCLUSIONS A local registration method, to update and improve the initial image-to patient registration during navigated bronchoscopy, was developed. The method was successfully tested in a breathing phantom setup. Further development is needed to make the method more automatic. It must also be verified in human studies.","Hofstad, Erlend Fagertun; Sorger, Hanne; Bakeng, Janne Beate Lervik; Gruionu, Lucian; Leira, Håkon Olav; Amundsen, Tore; Langø, Thomas",Medical physics,505,1

The expression of miR-1225 was investigated in breast cancer tissues and cells by quantitative real-time PCR. The role of miR-1225 in the cell process of OS was analyzed by CCK-8 assay and Transwell assay. The prognostic value of miR-1225 was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression analysis. miR-1225 was significantly upregulated in breast cancer tissues, which was associated with the TNM stage of breast cancer patients. The prognosis of patients with high miR-1225 expression was worse than that of patients with low miR-1225 expression, which indicated that miR-1225 acted as an independent factor for the prognosis of breast cancer. Additionally, the upregulation of miR-1225 promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of breast cancer, which suggested miR-1225 might be involved in the progression of breast cancer. JAK1 was identified as the direct target of miR-1225, which was also involved in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of breast cancer. The overexpression of miR-1225 in breast cancer indicates a poor prognosis of patients and promotes the progression of breast cancer by targeting JAK1. miR-1225 may be a biomarker and therapeutic target for the treatment of breast cancer.","Gao, Shangfa; Shi, Peng; Tian, Zhishuai; Yang, Xingwang; Liu, Ning",Clinical and experimental medicine,505,11

METHODS A cross-sectional study design was used to estimate the point seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a rapid immunoglobulin (Ig)M-IgG combined point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay among frontline firefighters/paramedics collected over a 2-day period, 16-17 April 2020. Fire department personnel were emailed a survey link assessing COVID-19 symptoms and work exposures the day prior to the scheduled drive-through antibody testing at a designated fire station. Off-duty and on-duty firefighter/paramedic personnel drove through the fire station/training facility in their personal vehicles or on-duty engine/rescue trucks for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. RESULTS Among the 203 firefighters/paramedics that make up the fire department workforce, 18 firefighters/paramedics (8.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, of which 8 firefighters/paramedics (3.9%) were IgG positive only, 8 (3.9%) were IgM positive only and 2 (0.1%) were IgG/IgM positive. The positive predictive value (PPV) of the serological test is estimated to be 33.2% and the negative predictive value is 99.3%. The average number of COVID-19 case contacts (ie, within 6 feet of an infected person (laboratory-confirmed or probable COVID-19 patient) for ≥15 min) experienced by firefighters/paramedics was higher for those with positive serology compared with those with negative (13.3 cases vs 7.31 cases; p=0.022). None of the antibody positive firefighters/paramedics reported receipt of the annual influenza vaccine compared with firefighters/paramedics who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (0.0% vs 21.0%; p=0.027). CONCLUSION Rapid SARS-CoV-2 IgM-IgG antibody testing documented early-stage and late-stage infection in a firefighter workforce providing insight to a broader medical surveillance project on return to work for firefighters/paramedics. Given the relatively low PPV of the serological test used in this study back in April 2020, caution should be used in interpreting test results.","Caban-Martinez, Alberto J; Schaefer-Solle, Natasha; Santiago, Katerina; Louzado-Feliciano, Paola; Brotons, Angel; Gonzalez, Marco; Issenberg, S Barry; Kobetz, Erin",Occupational and environmental medicine,505,28

Twenty subjects without laparoscopic experience were allotted into 2 groups. Group 1 was trained under the optimal ergonomic simulation setting according to current ergonomic guidelines (Condition A). Group 2 was trained under non-optimal ergonomic simulation setting that can often be observed during training in a skills lab (Condition B). Posture analysis showed that the subjects held a much more neutral posture under Condition A than under Condition B (p<0.001). The subjects had less joint excursion and experienced less discomfort in their neck, shoulders, and arms under Condition A. Significant difference in task performance between Conditions A and B (p<0.05) was found. This study shows that the optimal ergonomic simulation setting leads to better task performance. In addition, no significant differences of task performance, for Groups 1 and 2 using the same test setting were found. However, better performance was observed for Group 1. It can be concluded that the optimal and non-optimal training setting have different learning effects on trainees' skill learning.","Xiao, D J; Jakimowicz, Jack J; Albayrak, A; Goossens, R H M",Applied ergonomics,505,28

Endorectal advancement flap is a surgical option for the management of complex fistulae where, a tension-free, well vascularized mucosal flap is created and mobilized to cover the internal opening of the fistula. Open transanal endorectal repair has an estimated success rate of 60 to 93%. 6 These repairs, however, have been limited by the confinement of the rectal lumen.7 Transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) has evolved to overcome these challenges and to obtain better exposure while reducing injury to the sphincter and preventing stool incontinence. Studies show an approximate success rate of 75% with TAMIS.8-9 Robotic transanal surgery is one of the newest developments which has arisen from the natural evolution of minimally invasive surgery. Robotic assisted endorectal advancement flap provides excellent exposure at the anorectal junction. Robotic instruments have multiple degrees of freedom minimizing collision of instruments when compared to TAMIS. The robot provides improved ergonomics when compared to other approaches allowing for better dissection, mobilization of the flap, and intraluminal suturing.10 This video shows the technique and benefits of robotic assisted advancement flap.

These noncompliance behaviors partly reflect people's concerns for the inherent costs of social distancing while discounting its public health benefits. We propose that this oversight may be associated with the limitation in one's mental capacity to simultaneously retain multiple pieces of information in working memory (WM) for rational decision making that leads to social-distancing compliance. We tested this hypothesis in 850 United States residents during the first 2 wk following the presidential declaration of national emergency because of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that participants' social-distancing compliance at this initial stage could be predicted by individual differences in WM capacity, partly due to increased awareness of benefits over costs of social distancing among higher WM capacity individuals. Critically, the unique contribution of WM capacity to the individual differences in social-distancing compliance could not be explained by other psychological and socioeconomic factors (e.g., moods, personality, education, and income levels). Furthermore, the critical role of WM capacity in social-distancing compliance can be generalized to the compliance with another set of rules for social interactions, namely the fairness norm, in Western cultures. Collectively, our data reveal contributions of a core cognitive process underlying social-distancing compliance during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting a potential cognitive venue for developing strategies to mitigate a public health crisis.","Xie, Weizhen; Campbell, Stephen; Zhang, Weiwei",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,505,1

METHODS Six recent ICU ventilators were evaluated. Technical performances were assessed under two FIO2 levels (100%, 50%), three respiratory mechanics combinations (Normal: compliance [C] = 70 mL cmH2O-1/resistance [R] = 5 cmH2O L-1 s-1; Restrictive: C = 30/R = 10; Obstructive: C = 120/R = 20), four exponential levels of leaks (from 0 to 12.5 L min-1) and three levels of inspiratory effort (P0.1 = 2, 4 and 8 cmH2O), using an automated test lung. Ergonomics were evaluated by 20 ICU physicians using a global and comprehensive model involving physiological response to stress measurements (heart rate, respiratory rate, tidal volume variability and eye tracking), psycho-cognitive scales (SUS and NASA-TLX) and objective tasks completion. RESULTS Few differences in terms of technical performance were observed between devices. Non-invasive ventilation modes had a huge influence on asynchrony occurrence. Using our global model, either objective tasks completion, psycho-cognitive scales and/or physiological measurements were able to depict significant differences in terms of devices' usability. The level of failure that was observed with some devices depicted the lack of adaptation of device's development to end users' requests.

All six outbreaks detected in Hungary were secondary outbreaks and seem to be the tail end of the HPAI A(H5N8) epidemic that wasobserved in poultry over the winter and spring in central Europe from December 2019 (n=334).Genetic analysis of the HPAI A(H5N8) viruses isolated during this reporting period from Bulgaria and Hungary did not identify any major changes compared tothe viruses collected in the respective countries during the first months of 2020. This suggests a persistence of the virus in the two countries rather than new introductions via infectedwild birds. HPAI A(H5N8) virus has been detected in poultry and wild birds in western Russia within the reporting period, and as of the middle of September also in Kazakhstan. The presence of HPAI virus in western Russiaand in north Kazakhstan,spatially associated with autumnmigration routes of wild waterbirds, is of concern due to the possible spread of the virus via wild birds migrating to the EU.It is highly recommended thatMember States take appropriate measures to promptly detect suspected cases of HPAI, including increasing biosecurity measures.

Methods We searched Medline (via PubMed), Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang and Chinese Biomedical Literature (CBM) as well as websites of guideline organizations for CPGs on breast cancer published between 2018 and 2020. We used the RIGHT checklist to evaluate the reporting quality of the included guidelines by assessing whether the CPGs adhered to each item of the checklist and calculated the proportions of appropriately reported RIGHT checklist items. We also presented the adherence reporting rates for each guideline and the mean rates for each of the seven domains of the RIGHT checklist. Results A total of 45 guidelines were included. Eighteen (40.0%) guidelines had an overall reporting rate below 50% and only three (6.7%) reported more than 80% of the items.

Cat meat also has potential for contamination with of severe acute respiratory syndrome, anthrax and hepatitis, and its consumption might lead to an allergic reaction. We developed a very short-amplicon-length (69 bp) PCR assay, authenticated the amplified PCR products by AluI-restriction digestion followed by its separation and detection on a lab-on-a-chip-based automated electrophoretic system, and proved its superiority over the existing long-amplicon-based assays. Although it has been assumed that longer DNA targets are susceptible to breakdown under compromised states, scientific evidence for this hypothesis has been rarely documented. Strong evidence showed that shorter targets are more stable than the longer ones. We confirmed feline-specificity by cross-challenging the primers against 10 different species of terrestrial, aquatic and plant origins in the presence of a 141-bp site of an 18S rRNA gene as a universal eukaryotic control. RFLP analysis separated 43- and 26-bp fragments of AluI-digest in both the gel-image and electropherograms, confirming the original products.

METHODS A retrospective review of the local institutional AIS interventional databases of three tertiary academic centers was performed and the use of TRA identified. RESULTS TRA was attempted in 15 (1.5%) of 1001 patients; it was used in 12 cases due to transfemoral access (TFA) failure and in 3 as the primary strategy. The mean age was 72.3±8.6 and 46% were male. Baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 19.5±8.7, two patients (14%) received intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, and mean time from last known normal to intra-arterial therapy was 17.0±20.1 h. Five patients had anterior circulation occlusive disease and 10 had vertebrobasilar occlusions. TRA was effective in allowing clot engagement in 13 of 15 cases: one patient had a hypoplastic radial artery that precluded sheath advancement and one had chronic innominate artery occlusion that could not be crossed. Mean time to switch from TFA to TRA was 1.9±1.3 h and the mean time from radial puncture to reperfusion was 2.2±1.0 h. Modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction 2b-3 reperfusion via TRA was achieved in 9 of 15 patients (60%). No radial puncture site complications were noted. At 90 days, two patients (13%) had a good clinical outcome and seven (50%) had died.

Public involvement must be diverse and inclusive to enable research that has the potential to reach those that stand to benefit from it the most, and thus address issues of health equity. Several recent reports, however, indicate that public involvement is exclusive, including in its interactions with ethnic groups. This paper outlines a novel community-led methodology - a community sandpit - to address the inclusion of ethnic groups in public involvement in research, reports on its evaluation, findings, legacy and impact. METHODS Through detailed planning - thinking through and taking into account all stakeholders perspectives in the planning and design of the sandpit, relationship-building, co-design and co-delivery between the Public Programmes team based at Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust and the Greater Manchester Black and Minority Ethnic Network - the community sandpit was held in July 2018. RESULTS Fifteen community organisations took part in the two-day event, as well as six researchers, and six creative practitioners. Six community-based partnership projects were seed-funded; four of these received additional funding from other sources also. CONCLUSIONS Evaluation of the sandpit showed the format to be well-received by all: it levelled power relationships between community organisations, health researchers and research infrastructure; it developed capacity amongst researchers about the accessibility, role and potential of community organisations. Described as ""not another community seed fund"" by community partners, the sandpit offered community partners, equitable avenues for collaboration within Greater Manchester translational research and led to the formation of the Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic Research Advisory Group (BRAG Vocal Website information, - https://www.wearevocal.org/opportunities/black-asian-and-minority-ethnic-research-advisory-group-brag/ , 2021).

The symptoms of over ischemia/heart failure may be challenging to distinguish as dyspnoea and chest discomfort overlap with those due to COVID-19. Therefore, beside close monitoring with ECG, biomarkes and, in case of demonstrated cardiac involvement, echocardiography, strategies to improve myocardial oxygen delivery should be promptly applied. The cytokine release with complement and iNO dysregulation are established mechanisms potentially leading to sepsis-related cardiomyopathy, making sepsis per se one of the potential mechanism leading to acute cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, the hyper-inflammation with endothelial dysfunction is likely be responsible of both pulmonary in-situ platelet aggregation and deep thrombosis potentially leading to severe pulmonary embolism and right ventricular failure. Besides the customary antithrombotic prophylaxis for critical patients, D-dimer levels and tighter coagulation monitoring are recommended and should guide the choice for anticoagulation treatment.

Twitter and Instagram accounts were identified by accessing program/department websites as well as social media platform and internet searches. Year of creation, number of followers, and number of posts (July 1, 2018-December 31, 2020) were collected. Trends in usage were compared across years stratified by platform and by account owner (department vs. residency). RESULTS Instagram accounts are more than five-times greater for residencies compared to departments (42% vs 8%, p < 0.001). There was not a significant difference between the number of department and residency Twitter accounts (26% vs 23%, p = 0.37). Significantly more residency Instagram and Twitter accounts were created or first posted in 2020 compared to department accounts (Instagram: 100 vs 7, p < 0.001; Twitter: 31 vs 6, p = 0.001). Over 18% of residency programs had both Twitter and Instagram accounts compared to only 6% of departments (p < 0.001). However, department Twitter and Instagram accounts had significantly higher median total posts from 7/1/2018-12/31/2020 (Twitter: p = 0.0001, Instagram p = 0.004). While the number of Instagram followers and accounts being followed were similar between residencies and departments, department Twitter accounts had a larger median number of followers (1141 vs. 430, p=0.003) and account followings (308 vs. 192, p = 0.001) compared to residency accounts. CONCLUSIONS The number of residency social media accounts has significantly increased in 2020 compared to account creation of departments, with Instagram account creation exceeding that of Twitter and of departments. The opposite pattern in usage was seen related to number of posts, and with Twitter, followers, and number of followings, with departments outpacing residencies. This significant increase in account creation may have been influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic and the change to a virtual interview season, suggesting an unprecedented need for online engagement with applicants. As the increased social media presence will likely persist in future application cycles, further study about the impact of residency social media use on recruitment and applicant decision-making as well as effective strategies, is needed.","Bludevich, Bryce M; Fryer, Madeline; Scott, Erin M; Buettner, Hannah; Davids, Jennifer S; LaFemina, Jennifer",Journal of surgical education,505,1

A chest roentgenogram and computed tomography showed a giant mass in his right thorax. A CT-guided biopsy demonstrated a solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura (SFTP). Because of the large size of the tumor and the substantial pleural effusion in the right hemithorax, the patient was referred to our institution for radiofrequency ablation. After one month, we performed an exploratory thoracotomy to dissect the giant mass with the right, middle, and lower lobes. The measurement of the tumor was 20 cm × 18 cm × 13 cm and it weighed 3250 g. The histopathology of the resected specimen confirmed SFTP.

Design A living, systematic review. Database We conducted searches in the centralized repository L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). L·OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from the Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L·OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customized to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. Today it is maintained through regular searches in 39 databases. Methods We included randomized trials evaluating the effect of macrolides as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Randomized trials evaluating macrolides in infections caused by other coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomized studies in COVID-19 were searched in case we found no direct evidence from randomized trials. Two reviewers independently screened each study for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Measures included all-cause mortality; the need for invasive mechanical ventilation; extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, length of hospital stay, respiratory failure, serious adverse events, time to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negativity. We applied the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit it every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates. Results The search in the L·OVE platform retrieved 424 references. We considered 260 as potentially eligible and were reviewed in full texts. We included one randomized clinical trial that evaluated the use of azithromycin in combination with hydroxychloroquine compared to hydroxychloroquine alone in hospitalized patients with COVID 19. The estimates for all outcomes evaluated resulted in insufficient power to draw conclusions. The quality of the evidence for the main outcomes was low to very low. Conclusions Macrolides in the management of patients with COVID 19 showed no beneficial effects compared to standard of care. The evidence for all outcomes is inconclusive. Larger trials are needed to determine the effects of macrolides on pulmonary and other outcomes in COVID-19 patients.

To reduce the incidence of anastomotic leakage at the colorectal anastomoses, a diverting ileostomy has been recommended in these patients. METHODS Stripping of mesorectal fat from the rectum up to the peritoneal reflection allows transection of the rectum at the junction of the upper and middle rectum. A suture pulls in the lateral aspects of the rectal staple line so that this staple line is included within the barrel of the stapler. After the circular-stapled anastomoses is complete, a second layer of silk sutures is used to invert the staple line. RESULTS In 31 stapled colorectal anastomoses, three rectal transections were so low that a layer of sutures was not possible. In the 29 two-layer colorectal anastomoses, no anastomotic leakages were observed. The incidence of diverting ileostomy was reduced from 50 to 7 %. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that preservation of a 10-15 cm length of rectum allows a second layer of sutures to be placed over the stapled colorectal anastomoses. This is a safe alternative to a diverting ileostomy in selected patients.","Sugarbaker, Paul H",Annals of surgical oncology,505,1

DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING Data from the Jamaica Health and Lifestyle Survey 2008 (JHLS II), a nationally representative population-based survey that recruited persons at their homes over a 4-month period from all 14 parishes and 113 neighbourhoods defined as enumeration districts. PARTICIPANTS A subsample of 2529 participants aged 18-74 years from the JHLS II who completed interviewer-administered surveys, provided anthropometric measurements and whose addresses were geocoded. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE Mean BMI, calculated as weight divided by height squared (kg/m2). RESULTS There was significant clustering across neighbourhoods for mean BMI (intraclass correlation coefficients=4.16%). Fully adjusted models revealed higher mean BMI among women, with further distance away from supermarkets (β=0.12; 95% CI 8.20×10-3, 0.24; p=0.036) and the absence of supermarkets within a 1 km buffer zone (β=1.36; 95% CI 0.20 to 2.52; p=0.022). A 10 km increase in the distance from a supermarket was associated with a 1.7 kg/m2 higher mean BMI (95% CI 0.03 to 0.32; p=0.020) in the middle class. No associations were detected with fast-food outlets or interaction by urbanicity. CONCLUSIONS Higher mean BMI in Jamaicans may be partially explained by the presence of supermarkets and markets and differ by sex and social class. National efforts to curtail obesity in middle-income countries should consider interventions focused at the neighbourhood level that target the location and density of supermarkets and markets and consider sex and social class-specific factors that may be influencing the associations.","Cunningham-Myrie, Colette Andrea; Younger, Novie O; Theall, Katherine P; Greene, Lisa-Gaye; Lyew-Ayee, Parris; Wilks, Rainford",BMJ open,505,1

This paper aims to remove fog or smoke on endoscopic video sequences to augment and maintain a direct and clear visualization of the operating field. A new visibility-driven fusion defogging framework is proposed for surgical endoscopic video processing. This framework first recovers the visibility and enhances the contrast of hazy images. To address the color infidelity problem introduced by the visibility recovery, the luminances of the recovered and enhanced images are fused in the gradient domain, and the fused luminance is reconstructed by solving the Poisson equation in the frequency domain. The proposed method is evaluated on clinical videos that were collected from prostate cancer surgery. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework defogs endoscopic images more robustly than currently available methods. Additionally, our method also provides an effective way to improve the visual quality of medical or high-dynamic range images.","Luo, Xiongbiao; McLeod, A Jonathan; Pautler, Stephen E; Schlachta, Christopher M; Peters, Terry M",IEEE transactions on medical imaging,505,31

SARS-CoV-2 mainly involves the respiratory system, however, with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), neurological and special senses clinical manifestations have been reported rarely. The present study aims to investigate the MRI findings, clinical manifestations of neurological and special senses involvement in SARS-CoV-2 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS In this study, 284 articles from the databases ""Pub-Med, Web of Science-Clarivate Analytics, Embase and Google Scholar"" were identified. The keywords, coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 pandemic, MRI, brain, special senses, neurological involvement were entered into the search engines and the concerned documents were selected and reviewed. The descriptive information was recorded from the particular studies; finally, we included 48 publications. RESULTS The common neurological manifestations in SARS-CoV-2 patients were headache, impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovascular disease, ataxia, tremors, meningitis, encephalitis, cerebral bleeding, subarachnoid hemorrhage, frontal lobe, temporal lobe and intracerebral hematoma, hemiparesis and seizures. However, common special senses manifestations in SARS-CoV-2 patients were olfactory, auditory and gustatory disorders including red eyes, painless monocular visual disturbance, anosmia, ageusia, dysgeusia, dysosmia and hypoacusis. Moreover, the MRI findings identified in SARS-CoV-2 patients were isolated oval-shaped lesion in the corpus callosum, bilateral basal ganglia hemorrhage, ischemic lesions involving the corpus callosum, basal ganglia, cerebellum and vasogenic edema extending to the cerebral peduncles, pons and ventricles. CONCLUSIONS The neurologic manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 patients are highly variable. The SARS-COV-2 exerts its damaging effects on the nervous system and special senses by developing determinant numerous neurological and special senses' clinical manifestations. Physicians with the help of MRI must rule out the neurological and special senses manifestations among SARS-CoV-2 patients.","Meo, S A; Abukhalaf, A A; Alomar, A A; Al-Hussain, F",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,505,32

DESIGN Prospective, observational study. SETTING Six medical and surgical ICUs of a university hospital. PATIENTS Three hundred thirty-five patients with ICU-acquired pneumonia. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Development of predictors of adverse outcomes was defined when at least one of the following criteria was present at an evaluation made 72-96 hours after starting treatment: no improvement of PaO2/FIO2, need for intubation due to pneumonia, persistence of fever or hypothermia with purulent respiratory secretions, greater than or equal to 50% increase in radiographic infiltrates, or occurrence of septic shock or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. We also assessed the inflammatory response by different serum biomarkers. The presence of predictors of adverse outcomes was related to mortality and ventilator-free days at day 28. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was evaluated and related to mortality at day 28.One hundred eighty-four (55%) patients had at least one predictor of adverse outcomes. The 28-day mortality was higher for those with versus those without predictors of adverse outcomes (45% vs 19%, p<0.001), and ventilator-free days were lower (median [interquartile range], 0 [0-17] vs 22 [0-28]) for patients with versus patients without predictors of adverse outcomes (p<0.001). The lack of improvement of PaO2/FIO2 and lack of improvement in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score from day 1 to day 5 were independently associated with 28-day mortality and fewer ventilator-free days. The marginal structural analysis showed an odds ratio of death 2.042 (95% CI, 1.01-4.13; p=0.047) in patients with predictors of adverse outcomes. Patients with predictors of adverse outcomes had higher serum inflammatory response accordingly to biomarkers evaluated. CONCLUSIONS The presence of any predictors of adverse outcomes was associated with mortality and decreased ventilator-free days at day 28. The lack of improvement in the PaO2/FIO2 and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was independently associated with mortality in the multivariate analysis.","Esperatti, Mariano; Ferrer, Miquel; Giunta, Valeria; Ranzani, Otavio Tavares; Saucedo, Lina Maria; Li Bassi, Gianluigi; Blasi, Francesco; Rello, Jordi; Niederman, Michael S; Torres, Antoni",Critical care medicine,505,28

This study examines neurosurgical trauma patients' dispositions through two neighboring trauma centers to inform resource allocation. We conducted a retrospective review of the trauma registries for two Level 1 Trauma Centers in Santa Clara County, one academic and one community center, between February 1st and April 15th, 2018-2020. Events before a quarantine, implemented on March 16th, 2020, and events from 2018 to 19 were used for reference. Encounters were characterized by injuries, services, procedures, and disposition. Categorical variables were analyzed by the χ2 test, proportions of variables by z-score test, and non-parametric variables by Fisher's exact test. A total of 1,336 traumas were identified, with 31% from the academic center and 69% from the community center. During the post-policy period, relative to matching periods in years prior, there was a decrease in number of TBI and spinal fractures (24% versus 41%, p < 0.001) and neurosurgical consults (27% versus 39%, p < 0.003), but not in number of neurosurgical admissions or procedures. There were no changes in frequency of neurosurgery consults among total traumas, patients triaged to critical care services, or patients discharged to temporary rehabilitation services. Neurosurgical services were similarly rendered between the academic and community hospitals. This study describes neurosurgical trauma management in a suburban healthcare network immediately following restrictive quarantine during a moderate COVID-19 outbreak. Our data shows that neurosurgery remains a resource-intensive subspeciality, even during restrictive periods when overall trauma volume is decreased.","Zhang, Michael; Zhou, James; Dirlikov, Ben; Cage, Tene; Lee, Marco; Singh, Harminder",Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,505,33

Little is known about HMPV in children who are at high risk for lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). METHODS To determine the prevalence of HMPV in high-risk children and to identify HMPV risk factors, children ≤24 months with prematurity, chronic lung disease, and/or congenital cardiac disease who were hospitalized with LRTI were prospectively enrolled. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested for HMPV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B, and parainfluenza types 1-3. Demographics, medical history, and outcomes for those with HMPV and RSV were compared. A multivariate analysis was performed to determine HMPV risk factors. RESULTS Over 4 years, 1126 eligible children were enrolled. Pathogens were identified in 61% of subjects. HMPV was identified in 9.0%, second to RSV (45%). Coinfection with HMPV and RSV occurred in <1% of subjects. Subjects infected with HMPV were older (8.2 vs 4.0 months, P < .001), were born more prematurely (27 vs 33 weeks, P < .001), and more commonly had chronic lung disease (59.3% vs 21.8%, P < .001) compared with subjects infected with RSV. In a multivariate analysis that compared children infected with HMPV to all others, increasing age and household exposure to children ages 6-12 were associated with an increased risk, whereas birth at older gestational age and exposure to children age >12 were associated with a decreased risk. CONCLUSIONS HMPV was detected in 9% of high-risk children who were hospitalized with lower respiratory tract disease, representing the second most common virus in this population. Compared with all other subjects (including RSV-infected), subjects infected with HMPV were older but were born more prematurely.","Anderson, Evan J; Simões, Eric A F; Buttery, Jim P; Dennehy, Penelope H; Domachowske, Joseph B; Jensen, Kathryn; Lieberman, Jay M; Losonsky, Genevieve A; Yogev, Ram",Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society,505,1

The aim of the present study was to review nutritional factors influencing primary dysmenorrhea. METHODS Academic databases including Web of Science, EMBASE, Scopus, and PubMed (including Medline) were searched using keywords of nutrition, diet, and primary dysmenorrhea. In this study, observational studies that were published in English from 1990 to April 2018, which focused on nutritional factors affecting primary dysmenorrhea, were selected. The evaluation of studies was performed using a modified STROBE checklist with 10 items. RESULTS Out of 5,814 retrieved studies, 38 articles met inclusion criteria and were included for final data synthesis. The increased consumption of fruits and vegetables as the sources of vitamins and minerals, as well as fish and milk and dairy products have positive associations with less menstrual pain. Inconsistent results were reported on the consumption of other nutritional groups. Studies showed negative associations of meal skipping and following diet to lose weight with severity of dysmenorrhea. CONCLUSION A few studies showed inconclusive findings due to methodological heterogeneities for assessing nutritional habits and different methods of measuring dysmenorrhea pain. Therefore, further analysis and future interventional studies with stronger methodologies are required.","Bajalan, Zahra; Alimoradi, Zainab; Moafi, Farnoosh",Gynecologic and obstetric investigation,505,10

The above underlying diseases and ages of patients are the susceptibility factors of corona virus disease 2019 released by National Health Commission of China. It is an unavoidable fact that patients with chronic wounds have to go to the hospital for treatment prescribed by the physician. At the same time, we found that there were not a few patients who go far afield because of various reasons when go to the hospital for treatment. During the period of epidemic prevention and control, this kind of ""go far afield"" style of seeking medical treatment may increase the exposure risk during transportation. Accordingly, we convened 36 wound care clinics in different regions in Shanghai to implement the ""Five Measures"" to encourage patients with chronic wounds to seek medical treatment proximately. The principle of this operation is that when seeking medical treatment, trying our best to reduce as much as possible the transportation distance for patients with chronic wounds to minimize the exposure risk during the epidemic period and eventually support the epidemic prevention and control campaign.","Zhou, J Q; Dong, W; Xu, H L; Cai, Y M; Sheng, D H; Wu, F Y; Liu, Y K; Tang, J J; Lin, W D; Huang, L F; Lu, S L",Zhonghua shao shang za zhi = Zhonghua shaoshang zazhi = Chinese journal of burns,505,19

Low dose-rate (LDR) prostate brachytherapy offers excellent tumor control rates and has equivalent rates of rectal toxicity when compared with external beam radiotherapy. Owing to its proximity to the anterior rectal wall, a small portion of the rectum is often exposed to high doses of ionizing radiation from this procedure. Although rare, some patients develop transfusion-dependent rectal bleeding, ulcers or fistulas. These complications occasionally require permanent colostomy and thus can significantly impact a patient's quality of life. Aside from proper technique, a promising strategy has emerged that can help avoid these complications. By injecting biodegradable materials behind Denonviller's fascia, brachytherpists can increase the distance between the rectum and the radioactive sources to significantly decrease the rectal dose. This review summarizes the progress in this area and its applicability for use in combination with permanent LDR brachytherapy.","Schutzer, M E; Orio, P F; Biagioli, M C; Asher, D A; Lomas, H; Moghanaki, D",Prostate cancer and prostatic diseases,505,19

Dietary habits and the consumption of certain nutrients have been shown to influence inflammation. In this narrative review, we discuss currently developed tools to assess the inflammatory potential of diets and compare them with established tools. RECENT FINDINGS Four new indices were recently developed. The Inflammatory Score of the Diet is a modified version of the established Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII). The novel Empirical DII works without previous dietary intake assessment and the Anti-Inflammatory Diet Index was specifically developed in a northern European population. The Dietary and Lifestyle Inflammation Score addresses additional confounders. The informative value of dietary indices relies on the accuracy and completeness of dietary intake assessment. SUMMARY Dietary inflammatory indices are important tools to assess, compare and validate the inflammatory potential of diets across populations without the need for biomarker assessments. They allow to investigate associations between an (anti)-inflammatory diet with disease risk and course. Although the DII remains the most used index worldwide, currently developed indices allow more flexibility, have a different focus or simplify assessment. Additional foods, that were recently shown to modulate inflammation, but are not (fully) considered yet, may deserve more attention in the future.","Bahr, Lina Samira; Franz, Kristina; Mähler, Anja",Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,505,16

In December 2019, cases of unknown pneumonia first appeared in Wuhan, China. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between occupation and COVID-19 in the Ardabil Imam Khomeini hospital. METHODS This research was conducted as a cross-sectional and descriptive study. The questionnaires used in this study included demographic information to obtain the required information such as age, sex, clinical symptoms, underlying disease, type of drug used, smoking, occupation, hours of work, number of daily clients, use of mask or shield, type of working hours, weight and height and body mass index, number Family, place of residence, role in the family, presence of an infected person in the family, communication with the suspect, observance or non-observance of health protocols. Our sample size consisted of 774 subjects, all patients at the Ardabil Imam Khomeini Hospital. The subjects were selected randomly. RESULTS The results of this study showed that the mean age of patients was 56.70 years, with a standard deviation of 18.20 years. Three hundred and sixty participants (46.5%) were female, and 414 (53.5%) were male. In terms of occupation distribution, 317 patients (41%) were housewives. In addition, 57 people (7.4%) were farmers or ranchers. CONCLUSION In general, it can be concluded that due to severity of infection and threat posed by Coronavirus and the risk of infections between different occupations like the taxi driver and medical staff, it is very important to find out what jobs are in the big threat.","Sarailoo, Mehdi; Matin, Somaieh; Vosoughi, Mehdi; Dargahi, Abdollah; Gholizadeh, Helia; Rajabi Damavandi, Marzie; Abbasi-Ghahramanloo, Abbas; Kamran, Aziz",Work,505,1

Methods We conducted a systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42019129645). The search strategy incorporated keywords describing physical disabilities, employer-approved job accommodations, and employment retention or return to work approaches. We searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and ProQuest Theses and dissertations. Reviewers independently selected studies for inclusion. We used Hawker et al.'s method to assess study quality. Results We identified 2203 articles, of which 52 met inclusion criteria, developed a table of job accommodations commonly used by persons with physical disabilities, summarized the percentages of job accommodations used by persons with disabilities, synthesized evidence of the effectiveness of job accommodations, and identified the factors that influence job accommodation use. The most frequently reported accommodations were as follows: modification of job responsibilities, change of workplace policy, supportive personnel provision, flexible scheduling, and assistive technology. We summarized four types of facilitators and barriers that affect job accommodation use: employee-related factors, accommodation-related factors, job-related factors, and social workplace-related factors. Conclusion The absence of randomized controlled trials and prevalence of cross-sectional surveys provides inconclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of specific job accommodations for people with particular functional limitations. Our system of categorizing job accommodations provides a guide to investigators seeking to evaluate the effectiveness of job accommodations using experimental methods.","Wong, Jasin; Kallish, Natasha; Crown, Deborah; Capraro, Pamela; Trierweiler, Robert; Wafford, Q Eileen; Tiema-Benson, Laurine; Hassan, Shahzeb; Engel, Edeth; Tamayo, Christina; Heinemann, Allen W",Journal of occupational rehabilitation,505,16

The secondary aim was to identify factors associated with an increased risk of a VTE event in this low-risk group. PATIENTS AND METHODS Retrospective review of a consecutive cohort of patients undergoing THR during a 63-month period. Patient demographics, socio-economic status, ASA grade, type of anaesthetic, length of surgery and BMI were recorded. A diagnosis of VTE was assigned to symptomatic patients with positive imaging for a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or a pulmonary embolism (PE) within 8 weeks of surgery. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to identify factors associated with VTE after THR. RESULTS 3880 patients underwent THR during the study period, of which 2740 (71%) were low risk and prescribed aspirin for VTE prophylaxis. There were 34 VTE events, of which 15 were DVTs and 18 were PEs, with 1 patient diagnosed with both. The incidence of VTE was 1.2%, with no VTE-related deaths. Patients incurring a VTE postoperatively were more likely to be male (odds ratio [OR] 2.06, p = 0.022), of older age (OR 0.43, p = 0.047) and were more likely to be socially deprived (OR 0.32, p = 0.006). There was no significant difference with patients given low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) as an inpatient prior to discharge on aspirin (p = 0.806), nor any difference with the type of anaesthetic used during surgery (p = 0.719). CONCLUSIONS Aspirin is a relatively safe and effective choice for VTE prophylaxis in low-risk patients undergoing THR. Male sex and age >70 years were twice as likely to sustain a VTE and patients from the most deprived socio-economic background are 3 times as likely.","Howard, Thomas A; Judd, Caitlin S; Snowden, Gordon T; Lambert, Robert J; Clement, Nick D",Hip international : the journal of clinical and experimental research on hip pathology and therapy,505,1

In Madin-Darby canine kidney cells infected with influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, or B virus, SA-19 displayed a 50% antivirally effective concentration of 0.60 μM and a selectivity index (ratio of cytotoxic versus antiviral concentration) of 112. SA-19 was 11-fold more potent than unsubstituted aglycoristocetin and was active in human and nonhuman cell lines. Virus yield at 72 h p.i. was reduced by 3.6 logs at 0.8 μM SA-19. In contrast to amantadine and oseltamivir, SA-19 did not select for resistance upon prolonged virus exposure. SA-19 was shown to inhibit an early postbinding step in virus replication. The compound had no effect on hemagglutinin (HA)-mediated membrane fusion in an HA-polykaryon assay and did not inhibit the low-pH-induced refolding of the HA in a tryptic digestion assay. However, a marked inhibitory effect on the transduction exerted by retroviral pseudoparticles carrying an HA or vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) fusion protein was noted, suggesting that SA-19 targets a cellular factor with a role in influenza virus and VSV entry. Using confocal microscopy with antinucleoprotein staining, SA-19 was proven to completely prevent the influenza virus nuclear entry. This virus arrest was characterized by the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates. SA-19 appeared to disturb the endocytic uptake and trap the influenza virus in vesicles distinct from early, late, or recycling endosomes. The aglycoristocetin derivative SA-19 represents a new class of potent and broad-acting influenza virus inhibitors with potential clinical relevance.","Vanderlinden, Evelien; Vanstreels, Els; Boons, Eline; ter Veer, Wouter; Huckriede, Anke; Daelemans, Dirk; Van Lommel, Alfons; Rőth, Erzsébet; Sztaricskai, Ferenc; Herczegh, Pàl; Naesens, Lieve",Journal of virology,505,1

To review the vaginal cuff complications from a large series of total laparoscopic hysterectomies in which the laparoscopic culdotomy closure was highly standardized. Methods. Retrospective cohort study (Canadian Task Force Classification II-3) of consecutive total and radical laparoscopic hysterectomy patients with all culdotomy closures performed laparoscopically was conducted using three guidelines: placement of all sutures 5 mm deep from the vaginal edge with a 5 mm interval, incorporation of the uterosacral ligaments with the pubocervical fascia at each angle, and, whenever possible, suturing the bladder peritoneum over the vaginal cuff edge utilizing two suture types of comparable tensile strength. Four outcomes are reviewed: dehiscence, bleeding, infection, and adhesions. Results. Of 1924 patients undergoing total laparoscopic hysterectomy, 44 patients (2.29%) experienced a vaginal cuff complication, with 19 (0.99%) requiring reoperation. Five patients (0.26%) had dehiscence after sexual penetration on days 30-83, with 3 requiring reoperation. Thirteen patients (0.68%) developed bleeding, with 9 (0.47%) requiring reoperation. Twenty-three (1.20%) patients developed infections, with 4 (0.21%) requiring reoperation. Three patients (0.16%) developed obstructive small bowel adhesions to the cuff requiring laparoscopic lysis. Conclusion. A running 5 mm deep × 5 mm apart culdotomy closure that incorporates the uterosacral ligaments with the pubocervical fascia, with reperitonealization when possible, appears to be associated with few postoperative vaginal cuff complications.","O'Hanlan, Katherine A; Emeney, Pamela L; Peters, Alfred; Sten, Margaret S; McCutcheon, Stacey P; Struck, Danielle M; Hoang, Joseph K",Minimally invasive surgery,505,1

In SARS-CoV/macaque models, we determined that anti-spike IgG (S-IgG), in productively infected lungs, causes severe ALI by skewing inflammation-resolving response. Alveolar macrophages underwent functional polarization in acutely infected macaques, demonstrating simultaneously both proinflammatory and wound-healing characteristics. The presence of S-IgG prior to viral clearance, however, abrogated wound-healing responses and promoted MCP1 and IL-8 production and proinflammatory monocyte/macrophage recruitment and accumulation. Critically, patients who eventually died of SARS (hereafter referred to as deceased patients) displayed similarly accumulated pulmonary proinflammatory, absence of wound-healing macrophages, and faster neutralizing antibody responses. Their sera enhanced SARS-CoV-induced MCP1 and IL-8 production by human monocyte-derived wound-healing macrophages, whereas blockade of FcγR reduced such effects. Our findings reveal a mechanism responsible for virus-mediated ALI, define a pathological consequence of viral specific antibody response, and provide a potential target for treatment of SARS-CoV or other virus-mediated lung injury.","Liu, Li; Wei, Qiang; Lin, Qingqing; Fang, Jun; Wang, Haibo; Kwok, Hauyee; Tang, Hangying; Nishiura, Kenji; Peng, Jie; Tan, Zhiwu; Wu, Tongjin; Cheung, Ka-Wai; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Alvarez, Xavier; Qin, Chuan; Lackner, Andrew; Perlman, Stanley; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Chen, Zhiwei",JCI insight,505,16

Recurrent and non-recurrent congestion phenomena are increasingly affecting densely connected transit networks. In particular, the measures adopted to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic affect significantly public transport capacity. Therefore, transit operators require a tool that can quickly forecast real-time capacity issues in the transit system to perform service recovery (e.g. introducing new runs) and to inform passengers about crowding at stops (e.g. through real-time information panels or trip planners). This research proposes an innovative congested run-based macroscopic dynamic assignment model, which simulates service degradation for passengers mingling at stops and strict capacity constraints. Fail-to-board probabilities are introduced at the diversion nodes of a diachronic hypergraph to represent service performances and passenger volumes on each run, in the framework of an implicit route enumeration model.

Prospective applicants rely on websites and social media (SOME) to guide their decisions of applying or ranking a FP. We aim to evaluate HO FP's digital footprint in order to identify informational gaps. Methods: The AMA Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database (FREIDA) was queried for all HO programs. We searched Google, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube for HO FP pages. Content was evaluated using published criteria. Qualitative content analysis of SOME posts is planned. Results: Our analysis includes 176 FP that actively recruited during the 2020 match season. Over half (57%, n = 100) were universitybased and the median number of fellow positions per year was 4 per FP (range 0-16). Most FP had websites (95%, n = 167) with varying information (Table) for prospective applicants. Twenty percent (n = 33) included a diversity statement. While 63% (n = 106) of FP provided application information, only 51% discussed visa requirements. Few FP websites included key information such as why fellows chose a particular FP (7%, n = 12), accolades of fellows (3%, n = 5), or employment location of alumni (25%, n = 44). Only 42% (n = 69) provided city, and 5% (n = 8) showed fellows socializing. Thirty-four FP (19%) have informational videos (range 1-10) in YouTube (length range: 1:37-18:15min). Most (82%;n = 28) were published since May 2020 in alignment with the FP recruitment season. Twitter was the second most common SOME platform, used by 19% (n = 32) of FP. 56% (n = 18) joined Twitter since May 2020 correlating with the current recruitment season. The number of Twitter followers (median 119, range: 0-1408) and posts (median 47, range: 0- 687) varied across FP. Only 4% used Facebook and 6% Instagram. Conclusions: Our analysis of FP's digital footprint revealed that applicants participating in the 1st virtual HO recruitment season were provided limited online information. Programs can use online content to provide information on resources, research opportunities, and achievements of faculty and fellows that can guide applicant decision making.

Hand-designing such strategies is not trivial because of the number of possible interventions and the difficulty to predict long-term effects. This task can be cast as an optimization problem where state-of-the-art machine learning methods such as deep reinforcement learning might bring significant value. However, the specificity of each domain—epidemic modeling or solving optimization problems—requires strong collaborations between researchers from different fields of expertise. This is why we introduce EpidemiOptim, a Python toolbox that facilitates collaborations between researchers in epidemiology and optimization. EpidemiOptim turns epidemiological models and cost functions into optimization problems via a standard interface commonly used by optimization practitioners (OpenAI Gym). Reinforcement learning algorithms based on Q-Learning with deep neural networks (dqn) and evolutionary algorithms (nsga-ii) are already implemented. We illustrate the use of EpidemiOptim to find optimal policies for dynamical on-off lockdown control under the optimization of the death toll and economic recess using a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (seir) model for COVID-19. Using EpidemiOptim and its interactive visualization platform in Jupyter notebooks, epidemiologists, optimization practitioners and others (e.g. economists) can easily compare epidemiological models, costs functions and optimization algorithms to address important choices to be made by health decision-makers. Trained models can be explored by experts and non-experts via a web interface. ©2021 AI Access Foundation. All rights reserved.","Colas, C.; Hejblum, B.; Rouillon, S.; Thiebaut, R.; Oudeyer, P.

Objectives: To determine the clinical and laboratory factors involved in the mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: This descriptive-analytic study was performed in Kowsar Hospital of Semnan, Iran, using medical files of 107 patients hospitalized during February-April 2020 with COVID-19 diagnosis with the presence of chest CT findings. The patients’ demographic information, vital signs, clinical symptoms, lab test results, the prescribed medicines during hospitalization, past medical history, and outcomes were analyzed. The relationship between each of the explanatory variables with death outcome was examined using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models, reporting crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR & Adj. OR). Results: The mean age of the patients was 63.36 ± 16.43 years, 67 (62.6%) patients were male, and 85 (79.4%) patients were discharged. Low level of consciousness (Glasgow coma scale < 14) (discharged: 8.2% vs. expired: 40.2%, Adj. OR [95% confidence interval] = 17.9 [3.1, 102.7]), higher body temperature (37.1°C vs. 37.74°C, 3.62 [1.55, 8.43]), and higher blood alkaline phosphatase (177.6 vs. 247.6, 1.01 [1.00, 1.01]) at the time of hospitalization were associated with increased mortality. Also, having the symptom of fatigue or weakness at the time of hospitalization (61.2 vs. 36.4%, 0.06 [0.01, 0.46]), higher red blood cells count (4.67 vs. 4.15, 0.21 [0.08, .55]), and higher blood oxygen saturation levels (89 vs. 82%, 0.92 [0.85, 0.99]) were associated with a lower risk of mortality. Conclusions: Decreased level of consciousness at the time of admission was shown to be a critical and independent predictor of mortality. Several factors are associated with death in patients with COVID-19, which due to the complexity of the relationship between each of them, it is not practical and plausible to make a definite prediction of patients’ prognosis only by noting few factors without considering all the clinical symptoms and laboratory findings.

Methods: Eligible HCV viraemic adults from two clinics in Kyiv were treated with LDV/SOF +/- weight-based ribavirin for 12 weeks. Clinical assessments were performed at screening and week 24 and as needed; treatment was dispensed every 4 weeks. The primary outcome was sustained virologic response (SVR)12 weeks after treatment. Program costs in 2018 USD were estimated per patient treated using observed resource utilization, local unit, and antiretroviral therapy (ART) costs over the 24-week period. Results: 868 participants initiated on treatment, 87% (755) were PWID and 55.5% (482) were HIV co-infected. The common genotypes were 1 (74.1%) and 3 (22%) and SVR was achieved in 831/868 (95.7%) by intention-to-treat analysis. The average cost per patient treated was $680, assuming generic LDV/SOF and ribavirin pricing and standard quantitative HCV viral load testing. Medications comprised 38% of the average cost/patient, laboratory tests 26%, events (clinic visits, counselling) 10%, and indirect costs 26%. ART accounted for 60% of all drug costs, with HCV medications just 40%. Conclusion: Generic LDV/SOF +/- ribavirin provided produced exceptionally good outcomes including amongst patients with genotype 3 HCV and PWID at an average cost of <$700/patient year, including ART for those with HIV. Under the assumptions of generic drug pricing but higher laboratory costs, an average cost of $750/patient is likely a reasonable estimate for this intervention in Ukraine, excluding costs for scaling or maintaining the treatment program.","Antoniak, S.; Chasela, C.; Morgan Freiman, J.; Stopolianska, Y.; Barnard, T.; Gandhi, M.; Liulchuk, M.; Tsenilova, Z.; Dible, J.; Wose Kinge, C.; Minior, T.; Mohamed, S.; Barralon, M.; Marange, F.; Cavanaugh, C.; Ackpan, F.; van der Horst, C.; Antonyak, S.; Xulu, T.; Sigwebela, N.; Chew, K.

Very recently, the problem has been addressed with a crowdsourcing-based approach to scale up labeling efforts: to assess the truthfulness of a statement, instead of relying on a few experts, a crowd of (non-expert) judges is exploited. We follow the same approach to study whether crowdsourcing is an effective and reliable method to assess statements truthfulness during a pandemic. We specifically target statements related to the COVID-19 health emergency, that is still ongoing at the time of the study and has arguably caused an increase of the amount of misinformation that is spreading online (a phenomenon for which the term""infodemic""has been used).

The molecular mechanisms underlying these disparate outcomes are currently unknown. Glycosylation within the human host plays a critical role in influenza virus biology. However, the impact these modifications have on the severity of influenza disease has not been examined. Herein, we profile the glycomic host responses to influenza virus infection as a function of disease severity using a ferret model and our lectin microarray technology. We identify the glycan epitope high mannose as a marker of influenza virus-induced pathogenesis and severity of disease outcome. Induction of high mannose is dependent upon the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, a pathway previously shown to associate with lung damage and severity of influenza virus infection. Also, the mannan-binding lectin (MBL2), an innate immune lectin that negatively impacts influenza outcomes, recognizes influenza virus-infected cells in a high mannose dependent manner. Together, our data argue that the high mannose motif is an infection-associated molecular pattern on host cells that may guide immune responses leading to the concomitant damage associated with severity. SIGNIFICANCE Influenza virus infection causes a range of outcomes from mild illness to death. The molecular mechanisms leading to these differential host responses are currently unknown. Herein, we identify the induction of high mannose, a glycan epitope, as a key mediator of severe disease outcome. We propose a mechanism in which activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) upon influenza virus infection turns on expression of high mannose, which is then recognized by the innate immune lectin MBL2, activating the complement cascade and leading to subsequent inflammation. This work is the first to systematically study host glycomic changes in response to influenza virus infection, identifying high mannose as a key feature of differential host response.","Heindel, Daniel W.; Koppolu, Sujeethraj; Zhang, Yue; Kasper, Brian; Meche, Lawrence; Vaiana, Christopher; Bissel, Stephanie J.; Carter, Chalise E.; Kelvin, Alyson A.; Zhang, Bin; Zhou, Bin; Chou, Tsui-Wen; Lashua, Lauren; Ross, Ted M.; Ghedin, Elodie; Mahal, Lara K.",bioRxiv,505,10

Graphs of this type are usually large-scale but only a small subset of vertices are related in downstream tasks. Current methods are too expensive to this setting as the complexity is at best linear-dependent on both the number of nodes and edges. In this paper, we propose a new method, namely Dynamic Personalized PageRank Embedding (DynamicPPE) for learning a target subset of node representations over large-scale dynamic networks. Based on recent advances in local node embedding and a novel computation of dynamic personalized PageRank vector (PPV), DynamicPPE has two key ingredients: 1) the per-PPV complexity is O (m d / ϵ) where m, d, and ϵ are the number of edges received, average degree, global precision error respectively. Thus, the per-edge event update of a single node is only dependent on d in average;and 2) by using these high quality PPVs and hash kernels, the learned embeddings have properties of both locality and global consistency. These two make it possible to capture the evolution of graph structure effectively. Experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method over large-scale dynamic networks. We apply DynamicPPE to capture the embedding change of Chinese cities in the Wikipedia graph during this ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic.

However, how cortical microstructure develops during infancy remains unknown. We measured the longitudinal development of cortex from newborns to six-months-old infants using multimodal quantitative imaging of cortical microstructure. Here we show that infants’ cortex undergoes profound microstructural tissue growth during the first six months of human life. Comparison of postnatal to prenatal transcriptomic gene expression data demonstrates that myelination and synaptic processes are dominant contributors to this postnatal microstructural tissue growth. Using visual cortex as a model system, we find hierarchical microstructural growth: higher-level visual areas have less mature tissue at birth than earlier visual areas but grow at faster rates. This overturns the prevailing view that visual areas that are most mature at birth develop fastest. Together, in vivo, longitudinal, and quantitative measurements, which we validated with ex vivo transcriptomic data, shed new light on the rate, sequence, and specific biological mechanisms of developing cortical systems. Importantly, our findings propose a new hypothesis that cortical myelination is a key factor in cortical development during early infancy, which has significant implications for diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders and delays in infants.","Natu, Vaidehi S.; Rosenke, Mona; Wu, Hua; Querdasi, Francesca R.; Kular, Holly; Lopez-Alvarez, Nancy; Grotheer, Mareike; Berman, Shai; Mezer, Aviv A.; Grill-Spector, Kalanit",bioRxiv,505,1

Methods We surveyed Australian health professionals (HPs) who discuss genetic testing with patients, to assess knowledge of the moratorium; reported patient experiences since its commencement; and HP views regarding regulation of genetic discrimination (GD) in Australia. Results Between April-June 2020, 166 eligible HPs responded to the online survey. Of these, 86% were aware of the moratorium, but <50% had attended related training/information sessions. Only 16% answered all knowledge questions correctly, yet 69% believed they had sufficient knowledge to advise patients. Genetics HPs' awareness and knowledge were better than non-genetics HPs' (p<0.05). There was some reported decrease in patients delaying/declining testing after the moratorium's introduction, however 42% of HPs disagreed that patients were more willing to have testing post-moratorium. Although many (76%) felt the moratorium resolved some GD concerns, most (88%) still have concerns, primarily around self-regulation, financial limits and the moratorium's temporary nature. Almost half (49%) of HPs reported being dissatisfied with the moratorium as a solution to GD. The majority (95%) felt government oversight is required, and 93% felt specific Australian legislation regarding GD is required. Conclusion While the current Australian moratorium is considered a step forward, most HPs believe it falls short of an adequate long-term regulatory solution to GD in life insurance.","Tiller, J.

The limited sensitivity of a negative CT brain scan has historically mandated hospital admission and a lumbar puncture to look for evidence of blood in the cerebrospinal fluid. However, emerging evidence has suggested the sensitivity of clinical decision rules and modern CT imaging protocols within early onset of symptoms, may be sufficient to exclude the diagnosis. Methods A prospective, multi-centre, observational study of consecutive adult patients with acute severe non-traumatic headache presenting to emergency departments. We plan to recruit 9000 patients from over a hundred sites across the UK. The primary outcome is adjudicated SAH as defined by neuroimaging or cerebrospinal fluid findings consistent with the diagnosis. Data will be collected on clinical history, examination findings, phlebotomy and imaging results. All participants will be followed for 28-days to identify SAH and other clinically relevant outcomes using case note review, and later Hospital Episode Statistics. A proportionate opt-out model of consent will be used to maximise patient recruitment and study generalisability. Discussion Whilst there is increasing evidence that early neuroimaging strategies for the diagnosis of SAH are very sensitive, there have been no large studies to confirm this in the UK population. Furthermore, the test characteristics of CT brain beyond 6 hours from onset are not well understood and there is limited biological plausibility for this defined time cutpoint. Finally, the performance of the Ottawa clinical decision rule has shown promise in the Canadian population. However, its performance in the UK has not been studied and there are concerns that due to the low specificity it may result in increased, rather than decreased rate of investigations. This study will therefore aim to assess the test characteristics of both a CT brain up to 24h from presentation and the Ottawa SAH clinical decision rule.","Roberts, T.; Hirst, R.; Hulme, W.; Horner, D.",,505,1

Adults hospitalized between 3/5/20 and 12/1/20 in a Connecticut health care system were included if they had prior DM diagnosis, an in-hospital A1c, and a positive RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2. A1c was stratified into <7%, 7-<9%, and ≥9%. Both bivariate and multi-variable adjusted logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the association of A1c categories and admission glucose >200 mg/dL with mortality (in-hospital death or transition to hospice) and with intensive care unit (ICU) use. Models were adjusted for demographics and 8 relevant comorbidities. Among 733 patients (median age 67 years [interquartile range, 56-77], 48.3% female, 43.11% White, 35.47% Black, 24.97% Hispanic, 1.64% Asian), 31.7% had A1c <7%, 40.5% 7-<9%, 27.8% ≥9%, and 38.1% admission glucose >200 mg/dL. During hospitalization, 111 (15.1%) patients died or transitioned to hospice and 230 (31.4%) required ICU care. In 2 multi-variable adjusted analyses, neither A1c category nor high admission glucose were significantly associated with mortality (A1c 7-<9%: OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.53-1.49;A1c >9% OR 1.3, CI 0.72-2.35 compared with A1c <7%;glucose >200 OR 1.34, CI 0.72-2.35) or ICU care (A1c 7-<9% OR 1.30, 95% CI 0.88-1.93;A1c ≥9% OR 1.35, CI 0.86-2.1 compared with A1c <7%;glucose >200 OR 1.26, CI 0.9-1.78).

We review background methodologies, systematically collect data for EU countries, and develop a sound and ready-to-use procedure for computing indirect and total economic impacts. The routine is then applied to selected destinations for which a minimum standard in the quality of data from Tourism Satellite Accounts and Input–Output tables is met. Methodologically, the article provides a tool for estimating the total contribution of tourism to output, gross value added, and employment. Empirically, the comparison of results across EU economies shows a high degree of heterogeneity in the tourism share to GDP, which is critically discussed. Our procedure delivers a key tool to researchers, industry leaders, and policy makers willing to investigate income and employment consequences of scenarios differing in the evolution of tourism demand, something of high relevance in the COVID-19 era.

Patients with comorbidities have been identified as risk groups for severe COVID-19, also having a higher death risk. Previous reports have conflicting results regarding if solid organ transplant recipients present an increased risk for COVID-19. Nevertheless, previous investigations failed to distinguish between different organs received or made a longitudinal investigation on those patients. We recruited 39 solid organ transplant recipients: 25 kidney transplant recipients, 7 heart transplant recipients, and 7 liver transplant recipients and 25 age-matched non-transplant COVID-19 patients without comorbidities (control group) and compared daily laboratory data in addition to performing survival analysis. Heart and kidney transplant recipients presented an increase in several COVID-19 severity-associated biomarkers, such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and thrombocytopenia, in comparison to the control group and liver transplant recipients. Heart and kidney transplant recipients also presented an increase in the need for intensive care and invasive mechanical ventilation during the disease’s course. Importantly, heart and kidney transplant recipients presented a higher mortality rate in comparison to liver transplant recipients and non-transplant recipients. In our cohort, heart and kidney transplant recipients presented a difference in clinical characteristics and survival rate in comparison to liver transplant recipients. Further investigation involving immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in solid organ recipients should consider and separate patients according to the organ grafted.","Alberca, Ricardo Wesley Alberca Gabriela Gama Freire Netto Lucas Chaves Orfali Raquel Leão Gozzi-Silva Sarah Cristina da Silva Duarte Alberto José Aoki Valeria Sato Maria Notomi Benard Gil",Transplantology,505,25

Our key assumption was that the disease will change the active odour signature of the individuals just like other diseases (TBC, malaria, tumours, etc.). The pilot study was conducted in two places, based on the same protocolar methods, and it included four specially trained detection dogs in total. For the first phase of the project, we obtained 156 positive and 72 negative odour samples primarily from a hospital. Each detection dog involved in the study was imprinted with the smell samples of Covid-positive people. The first experiment only involved two dogs. With the other two dogs, the phase of imprinting a specific smell was longer, possibly because these dogs were burdened with previous training. During a presentation of 100 randomised positive samples, the experimental dogs showed a 95% reliability rate. Data from this pilot study show that specially trained dogs are able to detect and identify the odour samples of people infected with the SARS CoV-2 coronavirus.","Vlachova, L.; Hotovy, G.; Slechta, J.; Vana, R.; Vokralova, M.; Zeman, J.",,505,16

In this work, the temporal and spatial variations of shipping sound are calculated for the years before and during the pandemic in selected shallow water test areas from the Southern North Sea and the Adriatic Sea. First, the monthly sound pressure level maps of ships and wind between 2017 and 2020 are calculated for frequencies between 100 Hz to 10 kHz. Next, the monthly changes in these maps are compared. The asymptotic approximation of the hybrid flux-mode propagation model reduces the computational requirements for sound mapping simulations and facilitates the production of a large number of sound maps for different months, depths, frequencies, and ship categories. After the strictest COVID-19 measures were applied in April 2020, the largest decline was observed for the fishing, passenger and recreational ships. Although the changes in the number of fishing vessels are large, their contribution to the soundscape is minor due to their low source level. In both test areas, the spatial exceedance levels and acoustic energies were decreased in 2020 compared to the average of the previous three years.","Sertlek, Hüseyin Özkan",Journal of Marine Science and Engineering,505,1

On the other hand, large cities provide a large amount of data obtained daily thanks to the sensorisation resulting from the concept of 'smart cities', which makes it possible to display information from the sensorised areas and to alert the institutions of the problems and, for citizens, to know the situation of noise pollution based on data in order to be able to make the relevant complaints and denunciations to the institutions. A universally understandable way of displaying the information contained in the captured data is the generation of linguistic descriptions that synthesise the information residing in the data. This paper presents a method for generating linguistic descriptions based on the noise pollution data captured by noise measurement stations. A method for generating descriptions of a day will be presented that considers the daily periods in which the data taken from the stations are structured (daytime, evening, night-time and full day). In order to test the proposed method, available data from the city of Madrid have been used to generate descriptions that allow the influence of Covid-19 on noise pollution to be analysed. © 2021 IEEE.","Moreno-Garcia, J.; Jimenez-Linares, L.; Liu, J.; Rodriguez-Benitez, L.","2021 IEEE CIS International Conference on Fuzzy Systems, FUZZ 2021",505,1

Yet, their clinical use is limited, and comparative effectiveness is unknown. Methods: We present the first results of an ongoing, learning health system adaptive platform trial to expand mAb treatment to all eligible patients and evaluate the comparative effectiveness of available mAbs. The trial launched March 10, 2021. Results are reported as of June 25, 2021 due to the U.S. federal decision to pause distribution of bamlanivimab etesevimab; patient follow-up concluded on July 23, 2021. Patients referred for mAb who met Emergency Use Authorization criteria were provided a random mAb allocation of bamlanivimab, bamlanivimab etesevimab, or casirivimab imdevimab with a therapeutic interchange policy. The primary outcome was hospital-free days (days alive and free of hospital) within 28 days, where patients who died were assigned -1 day. The primary analysis was a Bayesian cumulative logistic model of all patients treated at an infusion center or emergency department, adjusting for treatment location, age, sex, and time. Inferiority was defined as a 99% posterior probability of an odds ratio < 1. Equivalence was defined as a 95% posterior probability that the odds ratio is within a given bound. Results: Prior to trial launch, 3.1% (502) of 16,345 patients who were potentially eligible by an automated electronic health record (EHR) screen received mAb. During the trial period, 23.2% (1,201) of 5,173 EHR-screen eligible patients were treated, a 7.5-fold increase. After including additional referred patients from outside the health system, a total of 1,935 study patients received mAb therapy (128 bamlanivimab, 885 bamlanivimab etesevimab, 922 casirivimab imdevimab). Mean age ranged from 55 to 57 years, half were female (range, 53% to 54%), and 17% were Black (range, 12% to 19%). Median hospital free days were 28 (IQR, 28 to 28) for each mAb group. Hospitalization varied between groups (bamlanivimab, 12.5%; bamlanivimab etesevimab, 14.7%, casirivimab imdevimab, 14.3%). Relative to casirivimab-imdevimab, the median adjusted odds ratios were 0.58 (95% credible interval (CI), 0.30 to 1.16) and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.24) for the bamlanivimab and bamlanivimab-etesevimab groups, respectively. These odds ratios yielded 91% and 94% probabilities of inferiority of bamlanivimab versus bamlanivimab etesevimab and casirivimab imdevimab respectively, and an 86% probability of equivalence between bamlanivimab etesevimab and casirivimab imdevimab, at the prespecified odds ratio bound of 0.25. Twenty one infusion related adverse events occurred in 0% (0/128), 1.4% (12/885), and 1.0% (9/922) of patients treated with bamlanivimab, bamlanivimab etesevimab, and casirivimab imdevimab, respectively. Conclusion: In non-hospitalized patients with mild to moderate Covid-19, bamlanivimab, compared to bamlanivimab etesevimab and casirivimab imdevimab, resulted in 91% and 94% probabilities of inferiority with regards to odds of improvement in hospital free days within 28 days. There was an 86% probability of equivalence between bamlanivimab etesevimab and casirivimab imdevimab at an odds ratio bound of 0.25. However, the trial was unblinded early due to federal distribution decisions, and no mAb met prespecified criteria for statistical inferiority or equivalence.

This study aims to investigate the level of depression and hopelessness during the COVID-19 outbreak, in women with primary and secondary infertility. Methods: A 16-item online questionnaire was applied to a total of 220 women with primary and secondary infertility in June 2020. Participants' knowledge and concerns about COVID-19 pandemic stop of treatments and follow-up preferences were evaluated. In addition, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) were adapted to Turkish and applied to each participant. Total scores of inventories between women were calculated. The correlation between depression and hopelessness levels of the groups was evaluated. Results: The BDI and BHS mean scores of 220 infertile women who completed our questionnaire were 14.63 ± 9.123 and 5.43 ± 5.026 and Cronbach'sa-values were 0.853 and 0.904, respectively. It was found that 142 women with secondary infertility had higher mean depression and hopelessness scores (15.92±9.758, 11.81±6.501;P = 0.001) VS 78 women with primary infertility (6.51±5.262, 3.78±3.670;P = 0.000).

The morphogenesis of C. albicans is closely related to pathogenicity (1). Ras1 in C. albicans is an important switch in the MAPK pathway for morphogenesis (2, 3). The MAPK pathway is important for the virulence, such as cell growth, morphogenesis, and biofilm formation (4, 5). Ume6 is a well-known transcriptional factor for hyphal-specific genes (6). Despite numerous studies, as a recent issue, it is necessary to develop a new drug that uses a different pathway mechanism to inhibit resistant C. albicans strains caused by chronic prescription of azole or echinocandin drugs, which are mainly used. Here, we show that the small carbazole derivatives attenuated the pathogenicity of C. albicans through inhibition of the Ras1/MAPK pathway. We found that the small molecules inhibit morphogenesis through repressing protein and RNA levels in Ras/MAPK related genes including UME6 and NRG1. Furthermore, we found the antifungal effect of the small molecules in vivo using a candidiasis murine model. We anticipate our findings are that the small molecules are the promising compounds for the development of new antifungal agents for the treatment of systemic candidiasis and possibly for other fungal diseases. Author summary The infection by the opportunistic human fungal pathogen Candida albicans occurs mainly in immunocompetent and immunocompromised humans, such as AIDS patients, immunosuppressant-treated organ transplant patients, and recent COVID-19 patients. Morphogenesis which the ability to switch between yeast and hyphal growth forms is one of the representative virulence factors of C. albicans. Here, we describe novel small molecules that show antifungal effects such as the inhibition of the morphogenesis and the biofilm formation, and maintenance of biofilm. Moreover, we found that these small molecules had antifungal activity in mouse experiments, and confirmed that they were also effective in drug-resistant C. albicans strains. Studies of some small molecules with structures similar to ours have already been reported to exhibit growth inhibitory activity against bacteria and Candida species. However, the mechanism of action of these molecules has not been elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated, for the first time, the mechanism by which these two small molecules inhibit C. albicans pathogenicity through inhibition of specific pathways. Our study, through the research of the mechanism of action of novel small molecules, provides new insights into the development of drug candidates not only for wild-type C. albicans, but also for strains resistant to existing drugs.","Park, Young Kwang; Shin, Jisoo; Lee, Hee-Yoon; Kim, Hag Dong; Kim, Joon",bioRxiv,505,1

Despite a profound interest in interactive methods, theoretical and practical issues of simulation still need examination, especially in the context of competence-based education. In present research pedagogical, psychological and linguistic issues of simulation are studied. Though, simulation is often referred to as a method or a game, we consider it to be an educational technology. Contrary to entertaining simulation, educational simulation used as technology usually is more than a case, because it has a structured scenario with a system of rules and prohibitions, which are created with a certain idea of forming specific competences.

Here we develop CRISPR-Cas13a-based (SHERLOCK) diagnostics targeting Ebola virus (EBOV) and Lassa virus (LASV), with both fluorescent and lateral flow readouts. We demonstrate on laboratory and clinical samples the sensitivity of these assays and the capacity of the SHERLOCK platform to handle virus-specific diagnostic challenges. Our EBOV diagnostic detects both the L and NP genes, thereby eliminating the potential for false positive results caused by the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP live attenuated vaccine. Our two LASV diagnostics together capture 90% of known viral diversity and demonstrate that CRISPR-RNAs (crRNAs) can be effectively multiplexed to provide greater coverage of known viral diversity. We performed safety testing to demonstrate the efficacy of our HUDSON protocol in heat-inactivating and chemically treating VHF viruses before SHERLOCK testing, eliminating the need for an extraction. We developed a user-friendly field protocol and mobile application (HandLens) to report results, facilitating SHERLOCK’s use in endemic regions.

Despite this, many athletes are reluctant to get the COVID-19 vaccine due to concerns that symptoms of vaccinosis may impair athletic performance. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of COVID-19 vaccination on the physiological responses to graded exercise. METHODS: Healthy participants completed a 20-minute bout of graded cycling exercise before and ~21 days after COVID-19 vaccination (2 dose Pfizer mRNA or 1 dose Johnson & Johnson). RESULTS: Oxygen uptake, CO2 production, respiratory exchange ratio, ventilation, heart rate, serum noradrenaline, and rating of perceived exertion were significantly elevated in the post vaccine trial. However, vaccination did not affect serum lactate, adrenaline, cortisol, predicted [V]O2max, and ventilatory threshold. Post-vaccine effects on heart rate and noradrenaline remained significant in non-infected participants that received the Pfizer vaccine. No significant effects in respiratory gas exchange parameters were found after vaccination in those previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2, but exercise adrenaline levels were significantly lower and serum lactate levels trending (p= 0.10) lower after vaccination. No changes in any physiological responses to exercise were found in control participants who completed two bouts of exercise separated by ~5 weeks without vaccination. CONCLUSION: Recent COVID-19 vaccination is associated with modest increases in the physiological demands to graded exercise in non-infected healthy people but may actually improve metabolic responses to exercise in those previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Whether or not these small effects could impact athletic performance at the elite level warrants investigation.","Pereira Batatinha, H. A.; Baker, F. L.; Smith, K. A.; Zuniga, T. M.; Pedlar, C.

Such combinations explain their widespread use in many applications, including in the domain of personal protective equipment (PPE). Indeed, foams are the materials of choice to fulfill a series of essential protective functions, including: (i) insulation, (ii) dissipation, (iii) adsorption, (iv) filtration, (v) flotation and, of course, (vi) cushioning. Historically, foams were developed by iterative formulation works aiming at nucleating and stabilizing bubbles of gas in a polymer matrix. The foaming of polyurethanes is among the earliest – and today most mature – methodologies. Indeed, polyurethanes are obtained from isocyanate precursors that have the ability to partially decompose in gaseous CO2 in the presence of water. The gas, also referred to as the blowing agent (BA), is released concomitantly with the polymerization reaction to initiate the expansion of the growing polymer. Because the BA is primarily embedded in the molecular structure of the precursors of the polymer, this system is usually labelled as self-foaming. With the growing health and environmental awareness regarding the toxicity of isocyanates, a burgeoning number of self-foaming polymers and their precursors that circumvent the use of isocyanates are reported in the literature. They combine an interesting range of assets – from the typical ease of use of one-pack systems to the relative innocuity of their blowing gas (e.g., CO2, H2O, halogen-free alkanes) – that are very well suited to the large-scale production of foams in compliance with strict safety and environmental specifications. In this context, the present review is showcasing both historical and emerging self-foaming (pre)polymers that represent opportunities for the production of the next generation of safer and environmentally benign PPE. A special attention is dedicated to the self-foaming mechanisms – i.e., the chemical transformations of the (pre)polymers that result in the release of the blowing agent – and its interplay with the physicochemical processes resulting in the hardening of the (pre)polymers (e.g., sol-gel or rubber-glass transitions). A classification of those mechanisms – (i) thermolysis and (ii) condensation – is proposed for the first time. The properties of the resulting foams are also briefly discussed in terms of densities, cell morphology and mechanical response with the intention to guide the reader in selecting the best foaming process for the targeted polymer matrix and with a special emphasize on the PPE application domains.","Monie, Florent Vidil Thomas Grignard Bruno Cramail Henri Detrembleur Christophe",Materials Science and Engineering: R: Reports,505,1

To fight against the virus, compulsory maintenance of nutritional status is very important. Age, sex, health status, medications and lifestyles are the important factors affecting individuals regarding their nutritional status. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the nutritional status of individuals is destabilized. To survive the current situation, a sustainable nutritional dietary should be maintained for strengthening the immune system. One of the most important ways to maintain the immune system is to supplement enough vitamin C. A spectrum of viruses that belongs to the coronavirus in humans usually causes the common cold, which is recently severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). SARS considered a major threat to public health, which is an emerging infectious disease. According to WHO, COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus, in which most people probably have low immunity. Eighty-five per cent of the immune system has been made by plant-based food supplements, which increase beneficial intestinal bacteria.

Leafy greens and vegetables play a very important role in food and nutritional safety. Green leafy vegetables are an excellent source of vitamins, phenolic compounds and minerals. Calcium and iron are rich in leafy vegetables than that of staple food grains. Folic acid is also present in leafy vegetables. Different leafy greens, especially Moringa oleifera leaves, contain a high amount of folic acid compared to other leafy and non-leafy vegetable plants. This review paper aims to explore the nutritional and antinutritional factors of some important leafy vegetables. The content of nutritional and antinutritional factors varies among the genera and species of most of the edible leafy vegetables. Antinutritional factors are considered the important compound in the plant, in which they determine the absorption capacity of nutrients in human beings. Important dietary factors such as phytates, oxalates, nitrates, glycosides and cyanogenic are fruitful in many health-related problems. This article mainly explores the significance of nutrition and the use of leafy vegetables to boost up the immunity system in human beings and provide reliable dietary strategies about food safety and nutrition to survive COVID-19 pandemic around the world, especially in India.","Abdussalam, A.

Collation of recent data after World War II by the Human Mortality Database allowed analyses, previously unattainable, of modal death-ages for sufficient numbers of selected European cohorts. The aim was to track modes, medians and means (>60 years old (y)) of all-cause mortality for both sexes. Methods The only highest-quality, large-number Lexis data available were analyzed: from nine countries: Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland; raw-data modes (and means/medians >60y, plus thin-plate-spline averages), were analyzed, plus pooled data. Results Here we show that for cohorts 1880-∼1900 dramatic sex differences existed between death-age changes with all countries except Iceland showing male modal negative trends lasting ∼10-20 years and medians in all countries near-constant or negative lasting ∼10-20 years; whereas females from all countries showed fairly constant positive trends (except Finnish modes and Norwegian medians). For cohorts ∼1900-1919 male and female modal trends were positive (except Dutch and Icelandic cohorts and Finnish females). The net results were that male mortality modes for Danish, Icelandic, Italian, Dutch, Swedish and Norwegian 1919 cohorts were roughly the same as for 1880 cohorts, whereas female death-age modes increased. Conclusion Results clarify previously knowledge concerning sex differences during this period. Despite improved environment in late adulthood over this period, this did not translate into increased male longevity and earlier events might have sealed their fate, especially in Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, aand Sweden (and, later, Iceland).","Clark, Jeremy; Rydzewska, Kamila; Podsiadło, Konrad; van de Wetering, Thierry; Ciechanowicz, Andrzej",bioRxiv,505,25

Prior work demonstrated that an ensemble of multiple BERT-based ranking models can not only boost the performance, but also reduce the performance variance. However, an ensemble of models is more costly because it needs computing resource and/or inference time proportional to the number of models. In this paper, we study how to retain the performance of an ensemble of models at the inference cost of a single model by distilling the ensemble into a single BERT-based student ranking model. Specifically, we study different designs of teacher labels, various distillation strategies, as well as multiple distillation losses tailored for ranking problems. We conduct experiments on the MS MARCO passage ranking and the TREC-COVID data set. Our results show that even with these simple distillation techniques, the distilled model can effectively retain the performance gain of the ensemble of multiple models. More interestingly, the performances of distilled models are also more stable than models fine-tuned on original labeled data. The results reveal a promising direction to capitalize on the gains achieved by an ensemble of BERT-based ranking models. © 2021 Owner/Author.","Zhuang, H.; Qin, Z.; Han, S.; Wang, X.; Bendersky, M.; Najork, M.","11th ACM SIGIR International Conference on Theory of Information Retrieval, ICTIR 2021",505,4

Insights from Quantile Regression Approach,16.551346,2.46322,2021,"Job erosion is a major concern globally, especially given the COVID-19 pandemic. Unemployment and low wages remain pressing societal challenges in the wake of increased automation, more so for traditionally disadvantaged groups in the labor market, such as women, minorities, and the elderly. However, workers who possess relevant information technology (IT) skills might have an edge in an increasingly digital economy. In this study, we examine the role of IT skills in labor market outcomes for workers. We leverage a household IT use survey from an emerging economy that captures detailed, individual-level data on IT skills and IT use, which are also integrated with household labor force survey data on workers' wages, occupations, and industries between 2007 and 2015. We find that basic IT skills increase employment probability, and these employment effects can be explained by both increased labor force participation and a higher probability of transitioning from unemployment to employment, after accounting for the decision to participate in the workforce. Advanced IT skills are not significantly associated with higher employment, conditioning on basic IT skills. However, having advanced IT skills helps workers to earn higher wages and incrementally increases the probability that they are employed in higher-paid jobs. Interestingly, the effects of basic IT skills on employment are significantly larger for the female and older workforce that typically has a higher preference for flexible work options. Additionally, IT skills complement occupations that have a higher share of nonroutine tasks that cannot be performed by predefined rules. These results emphasize the importance of providing necessary IT access and basic IT training to traditionally socially disadvantaged groups to reduce the IT skills gap and close the digital divide. We contribute to the literature by providing evidence on the role of different IT skills in the entire labor force across multiple occupations and demographics, going beyond IT professionals and employed workers who have predominantly been studied in the information systems literature. We discuss implications for the future of work and education and public policy for designing IT training policies for workers, students, and organizations to stimulate employment for workers with higher wages, particularly in developing economies and for traditionally disadvantaged segments of the workforce, such as women and the elderly, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Atasoy, Hilal Banker Rajiv D.; Pavlou, Paul A.",Information Systems Research,505,16

Its operation is supported by a smartphone application, via easy wireless Bluetooth connectivity and a platform for remote monitoring. The proposed device computes the mass flow by measuring the differential pressure in a venturi tube using a factory calibrated and temperature compensated differential pressure sensor. The latter is directly connected via a two-wire digital interface to the main control electronic board, and the obtained data are linearized. The venturi tube was preferred over a laminar flow restrictor, due to its simplicity and smooth easy to swipe surfaces despite its higher non-linear response characteristics. It is detachable from the whole device allowing easy disinfection or replacement, thus providing enhanced infection protection. The blood oxygenation and pulse rate are measured by an extremely sensitive and stable factory calibrated module, which includes internal LEDs, photodetectors, optical elements, and low-noise electronics with ambient light rejection. The device is entirely controlled by the smartphone and has no moving mechanical parts, displays, or buttons, thus offering high reliability and low production cost. The preliminary results showed that the proposed design solution is robust, user friendly and can deliver accurate and consistent respiratory and oximetry test results at the point of care, without the need for calibration. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Valchinov, E.; Rotas, K.; Antoniou, A.; Dermitzakis, A.; Pallikarakis, N.","International Conference on Medical and Biological Engineering in Bosnia and Herzegovina, CMBEBIH 2021",505,16

However, our patient underwent permanent pacemaker implantation due to the underlying conduction tissue disease and intermittent 2:1 AV block during the hospital stay. Clinical discussion It is likely that patients with an already diseased conduction system are at an increased risk of worsening of AV block following inoculation of the vaccine. Vaccine associated AV blocks are likely to be reversible. Presence of prior coronary artery disease and electrical abnormalities are important considerations.

Secondly, we adopt the stacked autoencoder (SAE) to reduce the dimensionality of Google search queries data. Thirdly, we adopt a signal decomposition method named variational mode decomposition (VMD) to decompose the influenza data into modes with different frequencies, which can extract the characteristic. Fourthly, we use artificial neural networks (ANN) to forecast these modes of influenza epidemics extracted by VMD respectively, then these forecasts of each mode are added to generate the final forecasting results.

An online survey was conducted with 590 Americans during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic (April 2020). Results indicated that while mainstream media were associated with fear, anxiety, and anger, social media were not. In turn, fear and anxiety were positively associated with risk perception, which increased intentions to wear face masks. Anger was negatively associated with risk perception, which reduced intentions to wear face masks. Mediation analyses revealed that these negative emotions and risk perception mediated the association between mainstream media exposure and intentions to wear face masks. Results provided support for the utility of integrating of the ATF and PMT to predict mask wearing behavior in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak.

In this paper, we propose a new memory-efficient method to identify Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) in metagenomic DNA streams. Our method is based on finding connected components in overlap graphs constructed over a real-time stream of long DNA reads as produced by MinION platform. We propose an efficient algorithm to maintain connected components when an overlap graph is streamed, and show how redundant information can be removed from the stream by transitive closures. Through experiments on simulated and real-world metagenomic data, we demonstrate that the resulting solution is able to recover OTUs with high precision while remaining suitable for mobile computing devices.","Zheng, Vicky; Sariyuce, Ahmet Erdem; Zola, Jaroslaw",bioRxiv,505,1

To separate the radar echoes of multiple people, conventional techniques cluster the radar echoes in the time, frequency, or spatial domain. Focusing on the measurement of the respiratory signals of multiple people, we propose a method called respiratory-space clustering, in which individual differences in the respiratory rate are effectively exploited to accurately resolve the echoes from human bodies. The proposed respiratory-space clustering can separate echoes, even when people are located close to each other. In addition, the proposed method can be applied when the number of targets is unknown and can accurately estimate the number and positions of people. We perform multiple experiments involving five or seven participants to verify the performance of the proposed method, and quantitatively evaluate the estimation accuracy for the number of people and the respiratory intervals. The experimental results show that the average root-mean-square error in estimating the respiratory interval is 196 ms using the proposed method.

If pathogen transmission within the human population is self-sustaining, or rapidly evolves to be self sustaining, novel human pathogens can emerge. Although many factors influence the likelihood of spillover and emergence, the rate of contact between humans and wildlife is critical. Thus, for those pathogens inhabiting wildlife reservoirs with pronounced seasonal fluctuations in population density, it is broadly recognized that spillover risk also varies with season. What remains unknown, however, is the extent to which seasonal fluctuations in reservoir populations influence the evolutionary dynamics of pathogens in ways that affect the likelihood of emergence. Here, we use mathematical models and stochastic simulations to show that seasonal fluctuations in reservoir population densities lead to seasonal increases in genetic variation within pathogen populations and thus influence the waiting time for mutations capable of sustained human-to-human transmission. These seasonal increases in genetic variation also lead to elevated risk of emergence at predictable times of year.","Remien, C. H.; Nuismer, S. L.",,505,11

Methods: Publicly available data as of August 26, 2021, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were used to calculate presumed population immunity by state. Seroprevalence data were used to estimate the percentage of the population previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, with adjustments for underreporting.

Finally, we estimated the percentage of the total population in each state with presumed immunity to SARS-CoV-2, with a sensitivity analysis to account for waning immunity, and compared these estimates to a range of population immunity thresholds. Results: Presumed population immunity varied among states (43.1% to 70.6%), with 19 states with 60% or less of their population having been infected or vaccinated. Four states have presumed immunity greater than thresholds estimated to be sufficient to disrupt transmission of less infectious variants (67%), and none were greater than the threshold estimated for more infectious variants (78% or higher). Conclusions: The US remains a distance below the threshold sufficient to disrupt viral transmission, with some states remarkably low.

Referral completion was 67% (1,408/2,104) in DRC, 48% (287/600) in Nigeria and 58% (2,170/3,745) in Uganda. In DRC and Uganda, RAS users were less likely to complete referral than RAS non-users in the pre-roll-out phase (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.48, 95% CI 0.30-0.77 and aOR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.58-0.88, respectively). Among children seeking care from a primary health centre in Nigeria, RAS users were less likely to complete referral compared to RAS non-users in the post-roll-out phase (aOR = 0.18, 95% CI 0.05-0.71). In Uganda, among children who completed referral, RAS users were significantly more likely to complete referral on time than RAS non-users enrolled in the pre-roll-out phase (aOR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.17-2.79). Conclusions: The findings of this study raise legitimate concerns that the roll-out of RAS may lead to lower referral completion in children who were administered pre-referral RAS. To ensure that community-based programmes are effectively implemented, barriers to referral completion need to be addressed at all levels. Alternative effective treatment options should be provided to children unable to complete referral.","Brunner, N.

We perform a patient-specific performance evaluation for a broad range of denoising algorithms (including the most popular Deep Learning denoising approaches, wavelets-based methods, methods based on Mumford-Shah denoising etc.), focusing both on accessing the capability to reduce the patient-specific CT-induced LAR and on computational cost scalability. We introduce a parallel probabilistic Mumford-Shah denoising model (PMS), showing that it markedly-outperforms the compared common denoising methods in denoising quality and cost scaling. In particular, we show that it allows an approximately 22-fold robust patient-specific LAR reduction for infants and a 10-fold LAR reduction for adults. Using a normal laptop the proposed algorithm for PMS allows a cheap and robust (with the Multiscale Structural Similartity index > 90%) denoising of very large 2D videos and 3D images (with over 107 voxels) that are subject to ultra-strong Gaussian and various non-Gaussian noises, also for Signal-to-Noise Ratios much below 1.0.

Results are in conflict as to whether hematologic malignancy (heme) patients or solid tumor (solid) patients are at particular risk. We compared COVID-19 infection outcomes in these cohorts at our institution. Methods: Retrospective chart review of COVID19 patients diagnosed from February 2020 to January 2021 who had a heme or solid diagnosis. We used Chi square analyses and ttests for statistical correlations. Results: We analyzed outcomes of 146 COVID-19 episodes. Median age was 64 (25-97), 49% were female, and 24% were minorities. 49 (34%) had heme malignancy. Age, race, BMI, Karnofsky, and Charlson index (CCI) were similar for heme and solid cohorts. All-cause mortality (37 vs 15%) and COVID-induced mortality (33 vs 10%) were higher in heme vs solid, Table 1. Need for hospitalization (73 vs 46%, p = 0.009) and ICU care (31 vs 14%, p = 0.02) were worse for heme. Mean length of stay was 14.6 days and did not statistically differ for both groups. Overall risk of thrombosis was 11%. Severity of hypoxemia correlated with mortality. Compared with patients not requiring oxygen, relative risk (RR) of mortality was 3.06 (p = 0.06) for nasal cannula, 3.82 (p = 0.03) for high-flow oxygen, and 11.9 (p = 0.0008) for ventilation. Heme patients trended towards increased need of high-flow oxygen or ventilation vs solid patients, RR = 1.65 (p = 0.06). Additional mortality predictors were chemo within 6 months of COVID-19, age &gt; 65, nursing home residency, CCI &gt; 5, ICU care, max CRP &gt; 100, ferritin &gt; 1000, abs lymph count &lt; 500, platelet count &lt; 100, and bacteremia or C. difficile coinfection (Table). Race, gender, Appalachian status, and BMI did not predict mortality. Among the above factors, recent chemo (p=0.0001) and bacteremia (p = 0.03) were more common in heme vs solid patients. A higher proportion of heme patients received treatment for COVID-19 (51 vs 32%, p = 0.03). The most frequent therapies across the whole group were steroids (n=43), remdesivir (n=29), and azithromycin (n = 17). Conclusions: COVID-19 poses elevated mortality and morbidity risk for hematologic malignancy vs other cancer patients despite similar preinfection demographics. Not surprisingly, need for ICU care, age, recent chemotherapy, and comorbidities elevate mortality risk in both heme and solid patients. Elevated inflammatory markers and severe lymphopenia appear to identify those patients who have immune dysregulation and greatest mortality risk. Mortality predictors.","Krem, M.

In Southwark, 40% of children live in poverty and 30–40% of GP visits were mental health related. Yet, there is a shortage of mental health support services for their population even before the surge in demand triggered by Covid-19. Given this backdrop, support for parental mental health should be more distributed in the wider society, utilising preventative community approaches for mental well-being, particularly for disadvantaged parents.Leadership interventionCombining principles of design thinking and co-production, the root causes of the problem of maternal and more broadly, parental distress, were investigated through focus group, individual interviews, clinical observations and preliminary data from primary care database. People considered to be important in the parents’ network of influence were then invited to ‘parent champions’ co-production sessions over zoom where champions were asked to co-design and co-deliver ways to better meet these needs. A total of 4 sessions were held to date with 60 champions from 13 sectors.OutputsInterventions co-produced from the multi-sector parent champions events include expanding a computer bank for the digitally deprived, developing culturally sensitive GP video briefings to address parents’ concern about Covid-19, and building a buddy system between parent champions and social prescribers.Process outcomes85% of the parent champions said they would do one thing differently to support self or other parents as as result of conversations during co-production. 60% said they feel more connected and less alone in coping with the crisis through the co-production process.Leadership learningWhen diverse and relevant people are involved in co-production, synergy happens, creating a higher point of leverage for wider impact.","Ip, Lindsay Casey Joseph Edginton Mark",BMJ Leader,505,1

While long-term studies on the correlates of protection, vaccine effectiveness, and enhanced surveillance are awaited, studies on breakthrough infections help us understand the nature and course of this illness among vaccinated individuals and guide in public health preparedness. Methods: This observational cohort study aimed at comparing the differences in clinical, biochemical parameters and the hospitalization outcomes of 53 fully vaccinated individuals with those of unvaccinated (1,464) and partially vaccinated (231) individuals, among a cohort of 2,080 individuals hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: Completing the course of vaccination protected individuals from developing severe COVID-19 as evidence by lower proportions of those with hypoxia, abnormal levels of inflammatory markers, requiring ventilatory support and death compared to unvaccinated and partially vaccinated individuals. There were no differences in these outcomes among patients who received either vaccine type approved in India. Conclusion: With a current rate of only 9.5% of the Indian population being fully vaccinated, efforts should be made to improve the vaccination rates as a timely measure to prepare for the upcoming waves of this highly transmissible pandemic.

The authors also explore the moderating effect of religiosity in an emerging nation marked by the dominance of the Islamic doctrine. Design/methodology/approach: Survey data from a sample of 561 consumers from Morocco were analyzed to test the hypotheses using structural equation modeling. Findings: First, attitude toward COVID-19 cause-related campaigns has a significant effect on consumer purchase intention;at the same time, it is influenced by identification with the cause, donation size, emotional arousal and subjective norms. Second, the results confirm the mediating effect of attitude toward COVID-19 cause-related campaigns, e.g. higher emotional arousal triggers positive attitude towards COVID-19 cause campaigns, which shapes consumer purchase intention. Third, Islamic religiosity acts as a moderator, e.g. individuals who feel themselves as highly religious are more likely to develop favorable attitude towards cause brands and therefore form stronger purchase intentions when exposed to COVID-19 cause campaigns. Practical implications: The findings of this research suggest a number of practical and social implications for both academics and practitioners. Successful cause-related marketing (CrM) campaigns should include facets inducing emotional arousal, superior donation size, identification with the cause and subjective norms, which, in turn, enhances consumers’ attitude toward the campaign, their attitude towards the brand and purchase intentions. Practitioners interested in expanding into majority-Muslim markets should also consider the use of faith-based messages and religious morals when planning CrM campaigns. Originality/value: While preliminary studies have already attempted to provide knowledge about the impact of COVID-19 on individuals’ health and well-being, potential effects on consumers’ decisions and behavior have not been considered much and are yet to be empirically investigated. This original research is among the first to provide insights about the potential use of COVID-19 cause to shape consumer purchase intention and behavior.

Methods: Data were used from the PROSpective Cohort with Incident Stroke-Berlin (PROSCIS-B;NCT01363856). NMDAR1-abs (IgM/IgA/IgG) were measured with cell-based assays from serum obtained within seven days after first-ever stroke. Seropositivity was defined as titers >1:10, low titers as <1:100 and high titers as >1:100. We assessed cognitive status annually up to three years after stroke with the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status - modified (TICS-m) and used crude and adjusted linear mixed models to estimate the impact of NMDAR1-abs exposure on TICS-m over time. Results: Data on NMDAR1-abs (median day of sampling=4[IQR=2-5]) were available in 583 of 621 PROSCIS-B patients (39% female; median NIHSS=2[IQR=1-4]; median MMSE=28[IQR:26-30]; median mRS=2[IQR=1-3]) of whom 76(13%) were seropositive (IgM:n=48/IgA:n=43/IgG:n=2).

We make the tool available as an open-source and also provide executable GUI-based applications. Preliminary tests revealed that the proposed method consistently provides compensatory responses with about 100 ms latency, representing involuntary control.

Therefore, comparison of surgical, ablative, and second-line external beam therapies will help clinicians, as management of NSCLC changes. We will conduct a meta-analysis, reviewing literature investigating these therapies in adult patients diagnosed with Stage I NSCLC (tumor ranging from 0-5 cm, with no hilar nor mediastinal nodal involvement, confirmed either through cytology or histology regardless of type). Methods and Analysis: We will search electronic databases from their inception to January 2021 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs, and cohort studies comparing the survival and clinical outcomes between any two interventions (lobectomy, wedge resection, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA), cryoablation and consolidated radiation therapies (EBRT, SBRT and 3D-CRT). The primary outcomes will include: cancer-specific survival (CSS), lung disease free survival, locoregional recurrence, death, toxicity, and non-target organ injury. In addition to the electronic databases, we will search for published and unpublished studies in trial registries and will review the references of included studies for possible inclusion in this review. Risk of bias will be assess using tools developed by the Cochrane collaboration.

Two prominent approaches to modeling the contagion process include (i) simulating the spread in contact networks through Monte-Carlo processes and (ii) tracking the disease dynamics using meta-population models. In both cases, the individuals are explicitly (contact networks) or implicitly (meta-population) assumed to belong to exactly one disease state (e.g., susceptible, infected, etc.). In reality, the disease states of individuals are rarely so cleanly compartmentalized. A particular agent can exist in multiple disease states (such as infected and exposed) concurrently with varying probability. To model this stochasticity, we present a new method, that we term as the Probabilistic Infection Model (PIM). Unlike traditional models that assign exactly one state to each agent at each time step, the PIM computes the probability of each agent being in each of the infectious states. Our proposed PIM provides a more layered understanding of the dynamics of the outbreak at individual levels, by allowing the users to (i) estimate the value of R0 at individual vertices and (ii) instead of an all or none value, provides the probability of each infected state of an agent. Additionally, using our probabilistic approach the overall trajectories of the outbreaks can be computed in one simulation, as opposed to the numerous (order of hundreds) repeated simulations required for the Monte Carlo process. We demonstrate the efficacy of PIM by comparing the results of the PIM simulations with those obtained by simulating stochastic SEIR models, as well as the time required for the simulations. We present results at the system and at the individual levels for three diseases;measles and two strains of influenza.

Thousands of pathway diagrams are published each year as figures in papers. But as static images the pathway knowledge represented in figures is not accessible to researchers for computational queries and analyses. In this study, we aimed to identify pathway figures published in the past 25 years, to characterize the human gene content in figures by optical character recognition, and to describe their utility as a resource for pathway knowledge. Approach To identify pathway figures representing 25 years of published research, we trained a ma-chine learning service on manually-classified figures and applied it to 235,081 image query results from PubMed Central. Our previously described pipeline 1 was utilized to extract hu-man genes from the pathway figure images. These figures were characterized in terms of their parent papers, human gene content and enriched disease terms. Diverse use cases were explored for this newly accessible pathway resource. Results We identified 64,643 pathway figures published between 1995 and 2019, depicting 1,112,551 instances of human genes (13,464 unique NCBI Genes) in various interactions and contexts. This represents more genes than found in the text of the same papers, as well as genes not found in any pathway database. We developed an interactive web tool to explore the results from the 65k set of figures, and used this tool to explore the history of scientific discovery of the Hippo Signaling pathway. We also defined a filtered set of 32k pathway figures useful for enrichment analysis.","Hanspers, Kristina; Riutta, Anders; Kutmon, Martina; Pico, Alexander R.",bioRxiv,505,1

When the academic research or market survey needs to fill in the questionnaire, it is a safe and necessary choice to use the network electronic form. In order to prevent the spread of virus, it is necessary to keep a safe distance between people. The demand for electronic forms is more diverse and vigorous. To prevent the spread of virus through interviews and questionnaires, we can change the way of filling in electronic forms to achieve the purpose of maintaining a safe distance. As a result, the demand for electronic forms has increased, and the electronic forms can be more convenient. At the same time, the anti-counterfeiting function of electronic signature is used. The undeniable characteristics of personal signature can be customized and diversified. At present, the system development and technology of web forms are various and mature. In order to increase the employability of college students, the implementation course of online spreadsheet is added to the professional courses of University, which has gradually become a popular option of software engineering for students' graduation design. From the system analysis and system design, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 and other technologies are selected. Through the programming framework on the server, through the browser, it is convenient to use the web spreadsheet. The system functions are successfully implemented, and the graduation design of university professional courses is completed, which is a reference for successful cases of course practice. This model is a successful example of system development. Combined with the theory of university courses and the practice of project design, the system development, design and system testing are completed successfully within the effective time limit.","Huang, M.

While SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the respiratory tract, clinical evidence indicates that cells from sensory organs, brain, and heart are also susceptible to infection. An understanding of factors critical for viral infection in these tissues may help identify novel therapeutics. To discover host factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 viral entry, we performed CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) screens targeting all 6000+ human membrane proteins in cells with and without overexpression of ACE2 using Spike-pseudotyped lentiviruses. We identified both novel as well as previously validated host factors. Notably, we used replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 to validate new viral-entry promoting genes, including potassium channel KCNA6, protease LGMN, and MHC-II component HLA-DPB1. We found that the overexpression of KCNA6 led to a marked increase in infection even in cells with undetectable levels of ACE2 expression. Our analysis of human olfactory neuroepithelium scRNA-seq data revealed that OLIG2+ cells--previously identified as sites of infection in COVID-19 autopsy studies--have high KCNA6 expression and minimal levels of ACE2, suggesting that the presence of KCNA6 may explain sensory/neuronal aspects of COVID-19 symptoms. Further, we demonstrate that FDA-approved compound dalfampridine, an inhibitor of KCNA-family potassium channels, suppresses viral entry in a dosage-dependent manner. Finally, we identified common prescription drugs likely to modulate the top screen hits. We then performed a retrospective analysis of insurance claims of ∼8 million patients and found a clinical association between screen-identified drug classes, particularly those targeting potassium channels, and COVID-19 severity. We have thus identified the potassium channel KCNA6 as a SARS-CoV-2 host factor, expanded our understanding of potential viral tropism, and identified promising targets for drug repurposing and development.","Wang, Chengkun; Dinesh, Ravi K.; Qu, Yuanhao; Rustagi, Arjun; Cousins, Henry; Zengel, James; Guo, Yinglong; Hall, Taryn; Beck, Aimee; Tso, Luke; Erdemic, Elif Tokar; Tanudtanud, Kae; Ren, Sheng; Tzeng, Kathy Tzy-Hwa; Wilk, Aaron; Wang, Mengdi; Carette, Jan; Altman, Russ; Blish, Catherine A.; Cong, Le",bioRxiv,505,23

To address this question, we leverage the most recent developments of the theory of the commons as learning systems. According to this theory, people are strongly responsive to perceived threats to the commons they (may) benefit from, and strive to learn and respond accordingly. Through this theoretical lens, we analyze thick qualitative data (January-April 2020) from the Covid-19 crisis, which resulted in unprecedented visibility of commons-related knowledge behaviors. The contribution of this inductive study is fourfold. First, we identify a new emerging taxonomy of knowledge behaviors, including knowledge unleashing and knowledge curbing behaviors. Second, we identify a new emerging taxonomy of commons-related postures, that is, specific cognitive and behavioral attitudes that an individual may display about a certain commons. Third, we identify interesting emerging regularities in the relationships between specific commons-related postures and specific knowledge behaviors. Fourth, we show that the empirical data, analyzed in the light of the theory of the commons, strongly suggest disentangling knowledge behaviors from their consequences: for example, knowledge withholding proved far from being ""intrinsically"" counter-productive. We argue that these results open up promising research paths and opportunities for new knowledge management approaches in a wide range of organized and self-organizing contexts, such as innovation ecosystems, sustainability transitions, open innovation, or crisis management.","Ricciardi, F.; Bertello, A.; Forliano, C.; De Bernardi, P.; Ieee,","2020 Ieee International Conference on Technology Management, Operations and Decisions",505,26

Such patients are at greater risk of severe SARS-CoV infection. Our purpose was to assess the parameters of cellular immunity in patients with lymphomas with a history of multi-course chemotherapy, therapy with anti-CD20+ antibodies and PCRconfirmed COVID19. Methods: The study included 12 adult patients with lymphoproliferative diseases (non-Hodgkin's large B-cell lymphomas (NHL) -7, Hodgkin's lymphomas (HL) -5) with a history of PCRconfirmed COVID-19. All patients underwent 4 to 6 chemotherapy cycles. The relative numbers of the main populations of leukocytes, T-and Blymphocytes, as well as subpopulations of Tlymphocytes, were assessed in the whole blood collected in K2EDTA anticoagulant using the BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer with a panel of antibodies according to the manufacturer's instructions (Becton Dickinson, USA). Results: Patients with HL showed a number of changes in the parameters of cellular immunity. The content of total lymphocytes and monocytes was reduced in comparison with patients with NHL by 34% and 56%, respectively: 14.3 (11;17) vs. 21.7 (15.2;32), and 6.0 (4.8;7.1) vs. 13.5 (12.9;13.7), respectively. An increase in granulocytes by 30% was revealed in patients with HL. No differences were found in the content of both general and main populations (CD3+, CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+, central and effector memory cells). However, the content of naive CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ lymphocytes in patients with HL increased by 43% and 62%, respectively. While the number of CD3+CD4-CD8-lymphocytes was 47% lower, the number of CD3+CD4+CD8+, on the contrary, exceeded the values in patients with NHL by 4.6 times. Patients with HL also showed a tendency towards a decrease in the number of NK and NKT-lymphocytes. Conclusions: The increased levels of naive lymphocytes and both populations of memory cells and a sharp increase in double-negative T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes in patients with HL could indicate certain characteristics of the disease course affected by COVID-19. The data require additional research and can be used to assess the condition of patients and to predict the therapy efficacy.","Kamaeva, I. A.; Lysenko, I. B.; Sagakyants, A. B.; Bondarenko, E.

However, information is lacking on symptoms that persist after recovery from COVID-19. In this study we assessed symptoms that persisted in patients even after their recovery and discharged from the hospital after one month from COVID-19. Methods: This study is an observational cohort study. Participants in this study were enrolled between 30 to 40 days after recovery from COVID-19 of the age 18 years or higher, who were hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed RT-PCR COVID-19 disease. Outcomes from post COVID-19 participants were elicited through questionnaire that consisted of three main parts beginning from subjects demographical data, depicting about the status of COVID-19 and other co-morbidities of the subject, and about post-COVID-19 symptoms and manifestations. Results: All subjects have reported some manifestation after recovery from COVID-19 whereas numerous symptoms and diseases were experienced by a great percentage of participants. Fatigue (56.25%), dyspnea (74.3%) and disturbed sleep (64.3%) were among the most common symptoms. However, more critical manifestations like renal failure and pulmonary fibrosis were reported by only a few percent of the subjects. Rating of worse physical and mental health after post-COVID recovery was also reported by subjects. There was a strong relationship found in between the presence of other co-morbidities before infection like diabetes, hypertension and in disease severity after infection. A total of 280 patients were enrolled and 160 completed the survey. Conclusions: Post COVID-19 sufferers often experience symptoms that cause a disturbance in their physical health, mental health and their respiratory status for several weeks even after recovery from COVID-19. Therefore, all subjects after recovering from COVID-19 should undergo long-term monitoring programme for their symptoms and condition improvement.","Fatima, G.; Bhatt, D.; Idrees, J.; Khalid, B.; Mahdi, F.",,505,20

Some of the most striking distortions concern the notion of success. At the same time, in conditions of uncertainty (for example, during the COVID-19 pandemic), these changes began to be of a special nature, which can be reflected not only in the features of psychocorrectional measures, but also on the quality of life of the codependent individual as a whole. The empirical object of the study was 167 women, aged 29-35 years, in relationships (in two study periods: before the pandemic and during the pandemic). Based on the test Scale for measuring codependency in relationships (L. Spann-D. Fisher, adapted by V. D. Moskalenko), the sample was divided into 2 subgroups of 47 people: women with a normal level of codependency, women with pronounced codependency. The article shows that the level of codependency of women during the period during a pandemic is associated with the fear of not having enough time devoted to the family, with the fear of saving the family and with the fear of a leadership position. We found a relationship between the manifestation of codependency in women during a pandemic and an orientation toward failure. There is a relationship between pre-pandemic level of codependency in women and women's perceptions of success. The level of manifestation of codependency in women in the period before the pandemic has an inverse relationship associated with the fear of a lack of time devoted to the family, with the fear of a leadership position.

Furthermore, recently available vaccination options might not be amenable or effective for all patients of this heterogeneous population. Therefore, these patients often rely on passive immunization with plasma-derived, intravenous or subcutaneous immunoglobulin (IVIG/SCIG). Whether the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and/or the progress in vaccination programs lead to increased and potentially protective titers in plasma-derived immunoglobulins (Ig) indicated, e.g., for humoral immunodeficiency remains a pressing question for this patient population. Purpose We investigated SARS-CoV-2 reactivity of US plasma-derived IVIG/SCIG products from the end of 2020 until 06/2021 as well as in convalescent plasma (CP) from 05/2020 to 08/2020 to determine whether potentially neutralizing antibody titers may be present. Methods Final containers of IVIG/SCIG and CP donations were analyzed by commercial ELISA for anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG as well as microneutralization assay using a patient-derived SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) isolate. Neutralization capacities of 313 plasma single donations and 119 plasma-derived IVIG/SCIG lots were determined. Results obtained from both analytical methods were normalized against the WHO International Standard. Finally, based on dense pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of an IVIG preparation from previously published investigations, possible steady-state plasma levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization capacities were approximated based on currently measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 potencies in IVIG/SCIG preparations. Results CP donations presented with a high variability with regards to anti-SARS-CoV-2 reactivity in ELISA as well as in neutralization testing. While approximately 50% of convalescent donations were none/low neutralizing, approximately 10% were at or above 1000 IU/mL. IVIG/SCIG lots derived from pre-pandemic plasma donations did not show neutralizing capacities of SARS-CoV-2. Lots produced between 12/2020 and 06/2021, entailing plasma donations after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 showed a rapid and constant increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2 reactivity and neutralization capacity over time. While lot-to-lot variability was substantial, neutralization capacity increased from a mean of 20 IU/mL in 12/2020 to 505 IU/mL in 06/2021 with a maximum of 864 IU/mL for the most recent lots. Pharmacokinetic extrapolations, based on non-compartmental superposition principles using steady-state reference profiles from previously published PK investigations on IVIG in PID, yielded potential steady-state trough plasma levels of 16 IU/mL of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 IgG based on the average final container concentration from 05/2021 of 216 IU/mL. Maximum extrapolated trough levels could reach 64 IU/mL based on the latest maximal final container potency tested in 06/2021. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 reactivity and neutralization capacity in IVIG/SCIG produced from US plasma rapidly and in part exponentially increased in the first half of 2021. The observed increase of final container potencies is likely trailing the serological status of the US donor population in terms of COVID-19 convalescence and vaccination by at least 5 months due to production lead times and should in principle continue at least until fall 2021. In summary, the data support rapidly increasing levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in IVIG/SCIG products implicating that a certain level of protection could be possible against COVID-19 for regularly substituted PID/SID patients. Nevertheless, more research is still needed to confirm which plasma levels are needed to provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in immune-compromised patients. Plain Language Summary People with deficiencies in their immune system often have an insufficient antibody response to antigens, e.g., bacteria, viruses, or vaccines. These patients therefore often receive antibodies from healthy people to replace the missing antibodies and build a first line of defense against infections. These antibodies (also called immunoglobulins (Ig)) are prepared from plasma of healthy donors, the liquid fraction of the blood without cells. This plasma is then split up in pharmaceutical production into its protein components. One of these is immunoglobulin G (IgG), which is the protein family that neutralizes/inactivates infectious agents as well as marks these infectious agents so they can be recognized by other parts of the immune system. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the severe to fatal outcomes for certain patient groups, especially people with impaired immunity, these patients and their physicians are interested in whether their antibody replacement therapy also confers protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. We analyzed the capability of plasma-derived Ig lots to (i) recognize SARS-CoV-2 protein by ELISA method as well as (ii) neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by neutralization studies using the actual virus under biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) conditions. Here we show increasing anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity over time of manufactured Ig lots produced between 12/2020 and 06/2021. The most recent lots had a neutralizing activity of up to 864 IU/mL. Considering that the USA represents Octapharma’s main plasma source, the progress in vaccination levels together with the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in this country suggests that the IVIG/SCIG neutralization capacities against SARS-CoV-2 might still increase and could potentially meet a level where antibody plasma concentrations in the patient confer immune protection. Key Points Patients with humoral immunodeficiency rely on plasma-derived immunoglobulin for passive immunization against numerous pathogens. SARS-CoV-2 neutralization capacities of plasma-derived immunoglobulins have increased over time with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination campaigns. Plasma-derived immunoglobulin in prophylactic use for immunodeficient patients could potentially protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the future.","Volk, Andreas; Covini-Souris, Caroline; Kuehnel, Denis; De Mey, Christian; Römisch, Jürgen; Schmidt, Torben",bioRxiv,505,1

The data revealed for the first-time that capsaicin can impede nocifensive response of C. elegans to noxious heat (32°C – 35°C) following a sustained exposition. The effect was reversed 6h post capsaicin exposition. Additionally, we identified the capsaicin target, the C. elegans transient receptor potential channel OCR-2.

As various forms of technology such as gaming can be potentially used as platforms for online teaching and learning, the study aims to investigate the use of vocabulary learning strategies (VLS) in a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) among Malaysian English as a second language (ESL) players. Data were obtained via a 12-hour online game-play recorded sessions of Guild Wars 2 involving four Malaysian ESL players. The participants consisted of experienced online gamers aged between 24 and 25 years. The game-play sessions were also observed to provide supporting details on how the players utilised strategies when learning English vocabulary. The outcome of the study revealed that the ESL players employed different VLS during their game-play sessions. Gu and Johnson’s (1996) categorisation of VLS, which are metacognitive, cognitive, memory, and activation strategies, was subsequently modified to accommodate the MMORPG context. The results showed that the top five strategies used by the players were meaning-making, consultation, using online dictionary, word comparison, and incorporating words with real-world contexts. © 2021, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak.

How Web-based consumer health information fails to support information seeking in the pursuit of informed consent for screening test decisions.",16.28151,2.5016768,2005,"Minus-strand RNA is the first RNA species made by plus-strand RNA viruses, such as mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and serves as a template for subsequent RNA replication and transcription. The regulation of minus-strand RNA synthesis has been difficult to study because of the paucity of minus-strand RNA. We have optimized a ribonuclease (RNase) protection assay which enabled the detection of minus-strand RNA synthesis from nonreplicating RNAs, thus clearly separating minus-strand from plus-strand RNA synthesis. We used an MHV defective interfering (DI) RNA containing a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene as a reporter to determine the cis-acting signal for MHV minus-strand RNA synthesis. It was found that minus-strand RNAs existed in double-stranded RNA form in the cell. By using various deletion clones, we demonstrated that the cis-acting signal for minus-strand RNA synthesis resides in the 55 nucleotides from the 3' end plus poly(A) tail of the MHV genome. This is much shorter than the 436 nucleotides previously reported for the 3'-end replication signal. No specific upstream MHV sequence was required for the initiation of minus-strand RNA synthesis. This finding suggests that the requirement for minus-strand RNA synthesis is much less stringent than that for genomic and subgenomic plus-strand RNA synthesis and that some of the minus-strand RNAs made may not be functional since they may lack the recognition signals for RNA replication or transcription. We further showed that the DI clones which actively transcribed a subgenomic mRNA from an internal intergenic sequence synthesized much less minus-strand RNA than those clones which did not transcribe subgenomic mRNAs, indicating that minus-strand RNA synthesis was inhibited by transcription from an internal promoter of the same DI RNA. This result also suggests that the regulation of the quantities of subgenomic mRNAs is not at the point of minus-strand RNA synthesis but rather at plus-strand RNA synthesis. Furthermore, the finding that the leader sequence was not required for minus-strand RNA synthesis suggests that the leader RNA regulates mRNA transcription during plus-strand RNA synthesis.","Lin, Y J; Liao, C L; Lai, M M",Journal of virology,505,1

Results showed that aqueous extract of HC exhibited a different magnitude of antioxidant activities in all model systems tested. Although HC showed weaker free radical scavenging and xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity than vitamin E, its anti-lipid peroxidation activity in rat liver homogenate was close to that of vitamin E. In animal studies, HC significantly decreased the levels of superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, hydroxyproline, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. However, an increase in the concentration of catalase was noted in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. HC also remarkably improved the morphological appearance of the lung of bleomycin-treated rats. These results suggest that HC possesses a protective effect against bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Interestingly, this protective effect was more pronounced than that of vitamin E. In conclusion, the protective effect of HC on pulmonary fibrosis could be partly associated with the reduction of oxidative damage caused by bleomycin.","Ng, Lean-Teik; Yen, Feng-Lin; Liao, Chia-Wen; Lin, Chun-Ching",The American journal of Chinese medicine,505,1

RNA interference (RNAi) is a robust method of post-transcriptional silencing of genes using double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) with sequence homology driven specificity. The dsRNA can be between 21 and 23 nucleotides long: this is converted to small interfering RNA (siRNA), which then mediates gene silencing by degradation/blocking of translation of the target mRNA. 2. RNA interference provides a simple, fast and cost-effective alternative to existing gene targeting approaches both in vitro and in vivo. The discovery of siRNAs that cause RNAi in mammalian cells opened the door to the therapeutic use of siRNAs. Highly intense research efforts are now aimed at developing siRNAs for therapeutic purposes. 3. Recent advances in the design and delivery of targeting molecules now allow efficient and highly specific gene silencing in mammalian systems. Synthetic siRNA libraries targeting thousands of mammalian genes are publicly available for high-throughput genetic screens for target discovery and validation. Recent studies have demonstrated the clinical potential of aptly designed siRNAs in various types of viral infections, cancer and renal and neurodegenerative disorders. 4. The present review provides insight into the novel therapeutic strategies of siRNA technology, which is the latest development in nucleic acid-based tools for knocking down gene expression, and its potential for silencing genes associated with various human diseases.","Pushparaj, Peter N; Melendez, Alirio J",Clinical and experimental pharmacology & physiology,505,16

Forty-four pigs were divided into four groups: non-infected control pigs, pigs that received a vaccine adjuvant, pigs inoculated with PCV2, and pigs inoculated with PCV2 together with the vaccine adjuvant. Infection was monitored until 69 days post-inoculation (PI). Some PCV2 inoculated pigs had hyperthermia, but no other clinical signs were recorded. No characteristic PMWS gross or microscopic lesions were observed in any of the pigs. PCV2 DNA was detected in lymphoid tissues by in situ hybridisation in 6 PCV2 inoculated pigs on day 69 PI. All PCV2 inoculated pigs seroconverted between days 21 and 49 PI, shortly after viremia detection. Moreover, viremia was detected between days 7 and 69 PI using PCR. A peak of the virus load was detected by real-time quantitative PCR between days 14 and 21 PI. There were no significant differences in the proportion of PCV2 positive serum and in the viral load between PCV2 and PCV2 + adjuvant inoculated pigs. Although PMWS was not reproduced in neither PCV2 nor PCV2 + adjuvant inoculated pigs, viremia detection and seroconversion indicated that all PCV2 inoculated pigs developed a chronic long-term asymptomatic infection. An increase of PCV2 replication was not observed in pigs inoculated with the adjuvant. These results indicate that the principle of immunostimulation may not be applicable under the experimental conditions used, suggesting that not all adjuvants used in commercial vaccines are capable of triggering mechanisms for PMWS development.","Resendes, Ana; Segalés, Joaquim; Balasch, Mònica; Calsamiglia, Maria; Sibila, Marina; Ellerbrok, Heinz; Mateu, Enric; Plana-Durán, Joan; Mankertz, Annette; Domingo, Mariano",Veterinary research,505,10

There is no evidence of benefit from such a strategy, while the dangers of inappropriate antibiotics are well described. OBJECTIVES To investigate the frequency, profile and related outcomes of infections by bacterial pathogens in patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS This was a prospective, descriptive study in a dedicated COVID-19 ICU in Cape Town, South Africa, involving all adult patients admitted to the ICU with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia between 26 March and 31 August 2020. We collected data on patient comorbidities, laboratory results, antibiotic treatment, duration of admission and in-hospital outcome. RESULTS We included 363 patients, who collectively had 1 199 blood cultures, 308 tracheal aspirates and 317 urine cultures performed. We found positive cultures for pathogens in 20 patients (5.5%) within the first 48 hours of ICU admission, while 73 additional patients (20.1%) had positive cultures later during their stay. The most frequently isolated pathogens at all sites were Acinetobacter baumannii (n=54), Klebsiella species (n=13) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (n=9). Length of ICU stay (p<0.001) and intubation (p<0.001) were associated with positive cultures on multivariate analysis. Disease severity (p=0.5), early antibiotic use (p=0.5), diabetes mellitus (p=0.1) and HIV (p=0.9) were not associated with positive cultures. Positive cultures, particularly for tracheal aspirates (p<0.05), were associated with longer ICU length of stay and mortality. Early empirical antibiotic use was not associated with mortality (odds ratio 2.5; 95% confidence interval 0.95 - 6.81). CONCLUSIONS Bacterial coinfection was uncommon in patients at the time of admission to the ICU with severe COVID-19. Avoiding early empirical antibiotic therapy is therefore reasonable. Strategies to avoid coinfection and outbreaks in hospital, such as infection prevention and control, as well as the strict use of personal protective equipment, are important to improve outcomes.","Moolla, M S; Reddy, K; Fwemba, I; Nyasulu, P S; Taljaard, J J; Parker, A; Louw, E H; Nortje, A; Parker, M A; Lalla, U; Koegelenberg, C F N; Allwood, B W",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,505,16

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused an international outbreak of a respiratory illness termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and rapidly spread to cause the worst pandemic since 1918. Recent clinical reports highlight an atypical presentation of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients characterized by severe hypoxemia, an imbalance of the renin-angiotensin system, an increase in thrombogenic processes, and a cytokine release storm. These processes not only exacerbate lung injury but can also promote pulmonary vascular remodeling and vasoconstriction, which are hallmarks of pulmonary hypertension (PH). PH is a complication of ARDS that has received little attention; thus, we hypothesize that PH in COVID-19-induced ARDS represents an important target for disease amelioration. The mechanisms that can promote PH following SARS-CoV-2 infection are described. In this review article, we outline emerging mechanisms of pulmonary vascular dysfunction and outline potential treatment options that have been clinically tested.","Karmouty-Quintana, Harry; Thandavarayan, Rajarajan A; Keller, Steven P; Sahay, Sandeep; Pandit, Lavannya M; Akkanti, Bindu",Int. j. mol. sci.

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY: In September 2020, a nationwide cross-sectional survey study among Dutch intensive care nurses was carried out to measure prevalence rates of symptoms of anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and need for recovery (NFR), objectified by the HADS-A, HADS-D, IES-6 and NFR questionnaires, respectively. Associated risk factors were determined using multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Symptoms of anxiety, depression, and post traumatic stress disorder were reported by 27.0%, 18.6% and 22.2% of the 726 respondents, respectively. The NFR was positive, meaning not being recovered from work, in 41.7%. Working in an academic hospital, being afraid of infecting relatives and experiencing insufficient numbers of colleagues were associated with more mental symptoms, while having been on holiday was associated with reduced depression symptoms and need for recovery. CONCLUSION: The first COVID-19 surge had a high impact on the mental well-being of intensive care nurses, increasing the risk for drop out and jeopardising the continuity of care.

METHODS: The neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and antibodies targeting nucleocapsid (N), spike protein (S), and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in longitudinal plasma samples from the LOTUS China trial were measured by microneutralization assay and ELISA. Viral load was determined by real-time RT-PCR. A total of 576 plasma and 576 throat swabs were collected from 191 COVID-19 patients. Antibody titers related to adverse outcome and clinical improvement were analysed. Multivariable adjusted generalized linear mixed model for random effects were developed. RESULTS: After day 28 post symptoms onset, the rate of antibody positivity reached 100% for RBD-IgM, 97.8% for S-IgM, 100% for N-IgG, 100% for RBD-IgG, 91.1% for N-IgM and 91.1% for NAbs. The NAbs titers increased over time in both survivors and non-survivors and correlated to IgG antibodies against N, S and RBD, while its presence showed no statistical correlation with death.

SETTING: We conducted a survey in Wuhan, China, to characterize the status of coinfected PLWH, their time to clinical improvement, and clinical prognoses. METHODS: Using a Wuhan shipping service for antiretroviral medications, the Wuhan LGBT Center screened 2900 PLWH shipping addresses and cross-referenced 36 of them to quarantine sites or hospitals, suggesting possible COVID-19 cases. Through telephone calls and WeChat (social media) messaging, we conducted a survey after obtaining online informed consent. RESULTS: We had 12 HIV-infected respondents (10 men and 2 women) who also reported COVID-19. The median age was 36 years (interquartile range: 33.0-56.3), mean age 42.4 years, and range 25-66 years of age. Nine of 10 persons on antiretroviral therapy (ART) presented with only mild COVID-19 symptoms. The 10th person on ART was a 56-year-old man who died at home early in the outbreak when health care services were overwhelmed. Two additional cases who had been in intensive care with acute COVID-19 were both men, aged 25 and 37 years; both were ART-naive until this hospitalization. Excluding the deceased man, 6 of 11 coinfected persons reported feeling depressed even after clinical improvements. CONCLUSION: Twelve coinfected persons were identified in Wuhan; 9 of 10 were on long-term ART and had favorable outcomes. Two men identified as having started ART only recently were found to have severe symptoms. Our case series suggests the value of ART for potential mitigation of COVID-19 coinfection.","Hu, Yifei; Ma, Juntao; Huang, Haojie; Vermund, Sten H",J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,505,16

The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of the pandemic on neurofibromatosis (NF) care and research. METHODS: Sixty-three United States NF clinics were surveyed to identify the impact of the pandemic on clinician role, patient volume, continuity of guideline-driven surveillance, research protocols, and use of (and satisfaction with) telehealth for the delivery of NF care. RESULTS: Fifty-two clinic directors or their representatives completed the survey (83% response rate). About 2/3 of the clinics reported a greater than 50% decrease in the number of available patient appointments, and modified clinical surveillance and research protocols. Fifty-one clinics (98%) newly instituted telehealth during the pandemic. Barriers to telehealth prior to the pandemic were insurance reimbursement concerns and lack of infrastructure. Since telehealth was initiated, high provider satisfaction was reported with ease of use. The most common area of concern was related to inability to perform a physical examination. CONCLUSION: Results show marked impacts on NF care and research since the beginning of the pandemic, with potential long-term changes related to the introduction (or adoption) of telehealth for clinical care.","Radtke, Heather B; Klein-Tasman, Bonita P; Merker, Vanessa L; Knight, Pamela; Ullrich, Nicole J; Jordan, Justin T; Korf, Bruce; Plotkin, Scott R",Orphanet J Rare Dis,505,16

The spike protein of the virus and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) lead to the presence of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the cells and, subsequently,decreased ACE2 expression. The therapeutic possibilities of ACE2 antibody, ACE2-derived peptides, and small molecule blockers of ACE2 include a receptor-binding domain blocking approach. Hence,future studies of ACE2 may be very helpful in discovering a therapy for SARS-CoV-2.

CICOs are high-acuity situations with rare opportunities for safe practice. In COVID-19 airway management guidelines, bougie-assisted surgical cricothyrotomy is the recommended emergency strategy for CICO situations. Methods: We designed a 4-hour procedural simulation workshop on surgical cricothyrotomy to train 16 medical residents. We provided prerequisite readings, a lecture, and a videotaped demonstration. Two clinical scenarios introduced deliberate practice on partial-task neck simulators and fresh human cadavers. We segmented an evidence-based procedure and asked participants to verbalize the five steps of the procedure on multiple occasions. Results: Thirty-two residents who participated in the workshops were surveyed, with a 97% response rate (16 of 16 from anesthesiology, 15 of 16 from emergency medicine). Participants commented positively on the workshop's authenticity, its structure, the quality of the feedback provided, and its perceived impact on improving skills in surgical cricothyrotomy. We analyzed narrative comments related to three domains: preparation for the procedure, performing the procedure, and maintaining the skills. Participants highlighted the importance of performing the procedure many times and mentioned the representativeness of fresh cadavers. Discussion: We developed a surgical cricothyrotomy simulation workshop for anesthesiology and emergency medicine residents. Residents in the two specialities uniformly appreciated its format and content. We identified common pitfalls when executing the procedure and provided practical tips and material to facilitate implementation, in particular to face the COVID-19 pandemic.","Asselin, Mathieu; Lafleur, Alexandre; Labrecque, Pascal; Pellerin, Hélène; Tremblay, Marie-Hélène; Chiniara, Gilles",MedEdPORTAL,505,32

While there is a spectrum of disease severity and presenting symptoms in infected patients, hypoxemic respiratory failure is the leading cause of mortality. Decision to intubate in rapidly deteriorating patients plays a significant role in determining patient outcome. In most patients, COVID-19 pneumonia initially causes worsening hypoxemia but minimal impairment of lung compliance which determines the work of breathing (WOB). Once adequate arterial oxygenation is established, a tool to determine WOB independent of oxygen needs can guide the decision to intubate for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). We monitored oxygen requirements and WOB in 14 patients admitted to our ICU with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. All patients had radiographic evidence of extensive lung disease, significant hypoxemia and multiple comorbidities. Hypoxemia was managed through non-invasive means, predominantly using highflow nasal cannula. To assess WOB, we used a scale developed by us assigning points to the respiratory rate and use of respiratory accessory muscles (range, 1 to 7) (Figure 1a). This was used at the time of initial evaluation and throughout the ICU stay. Out of 14 patients, 10 did not require intubation and recovered while 4 were intubated. We compared the maximum and average WOB of the non-intubated patients throughout their ICU stay with the WOB of intubated patients measured within 24 hours before intubation (Figure 1b). The maximal and the average WOB were higher in patients requiring intubation (mean ± SD, maximal 4.3 ± 0.9 vs 5.5 ± 1.0 pts, p = 0.028 and average 2.7 ± 0.6 vs 3.9 ± 0.5 pts, p = 0.002). Breakdown of the various WOB components demonstrated a statistically significantly higher maximal and average use of respiratory accessory muscles (assessed as their aggregate sum) and higher average respiratory rate in intubated patients. However, the maximal respiratory rate was not significantly higher. Our data illustrates the initial response to COVID-19 lung injury is tachypnea which can be sustained with adequate oxygenation. As lung injury progresses with more recruitment of respiratory accessory muscles, intubation for IMV becomes necessary. Our WOB scale becomes a useful tool to assist in the decision of when to intubate. It is simple to teach, apply and incorporate into routine patient assessment. We recommend routine and systematic WOB assessment to plan for orderly nonemergent intubations for IMV. Further refinement on the interventions recommended based on specific WOB level and other modifying factors is awaited.","Shahid, A.; Nadeem, A.; Fanapour, P.; Apigo, M.; Kim, S.; Khan, M.; Patel, C.; Carnate, R.; Gazmuri, R.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,505,24

Methods: To capture the impact of COVID-19 on its members, the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons (AAHKS) sent 6 surveys over a span of seven months from late March until September of 2020 querying its members regarding the effects of COVID on the health and wellbeing of their personal, financial and clinical practice. Results: 92% of surgeons reported a cessation of elective inpatient cases during the height of the crisis. The reduction was greatest for surgeries performed in hospital-based sites of care. 91% reported a drop in clinic volume. At the final surveys, these numbers where 7% and 59%, respectively. In addition, there was a widespread increase in the use of telemedicine during this period. Only a small number of orthopaedic practices permanently closed due to COVID-19; 68% of surgeons, however, sought federal funding to offset their loss of revenue due to the restrictions placed on elective surgeries. Lastly, once elective surgeries were re-instated, the majority of surgeons reported no restrictions with surgical cases and that they believed they were adapting to the challenges of COVID successfully. Discussion: The impact of COVID-19 in 2020 on the practice of arthroplasty resulted in nearly universal loss of volume and significant financial stress. Recovery has been consistent, but incomplete for most practices. Continued monitoring of the members of AAHKS will be needed in 2021 to measure the strength of the demonstrated adaptive recovery of 2020.","Stambough, Jeffrey B; Deen, Justin T; Walton, Sharon L; Kerr, Joshua M; Zarski, Michael J; Yates, Adolph J; Andrawis, John P",,505,22

The placenta serves as a gatekeeper between mother and fetus. Knowledge regarding the barrier capacity of the placenta for nanoparticles is limited, mostly due to technical obstacles and ethical issues. We systematically summarize and discuss the current evidence and define knowledge gaps concerning the maternal-fetal transport and fetoplacental accumulation of (ultra)fine particles and nanoparticles. We included 73 studies on placental translocation of particles, of which 21 in vitro/ex vivo studies, 50 animal studies, and 2 human studies on transplacental particle transfer. This systematic review shows that (i) (ultra)fine particles and engineered nanoparticles can bypass the placenta and reach fetal units as observed for all the applied models irrespective of the species origin (i.e., rodent, rabbit, or human) or the complexity (i.e., in vitro, ex vivo, or in vivo), (ii) particle size, particle material, dose, particle dissolution, gestational stage of the model, and surface composition influence maternal-fetal translocation, and (iii) no simple, standardized method for nanoparticle detection and/or quantification in biological matrices is available to date.

In Catalonia, the use of eConsulta, an asynchronous teleconsultation service between primary care professionals and citizens in the public health care system, has already reached 1 million cases. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of eConsulta was growing at a monthly rate of 7%, and the growth has been exponential from March 15, 2020 to the present day. Despite its widespread usage, there is little qualitative evidence describing how this tool is used. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to annotate a random sample of teleconsultations from eConsulta, and to evaluate the level of agreement between health care professionals with respect to the annotation. METHODS: Twenty general practitioners retrospectively annotated a random sample of 5382 cases managed by eConsulta according to three aspects: the type of interaction according to 6 author-proposed categories, whether the practitioners believed a face-to-face visit was avoided, and whether they believed the patient would have requested a face-to-face visit had eConsulta not been available. A total of 1217 cases were classified three times by three different professionals to assess the degree of consensus among them. RESULTS: The general practitioners considered that 79.60% (4284/5382) of the teleconsultations resulted in avoiding a face-to-face visit, and considered that 64.96% (3496/5382) of the time, the patient would have made a face-to-face visit in the absence of a service like eConsulta. The most frequent uses were for management of test results (26.77%, 1433/5354), management of repeat prescriptions (24.30%, 1301/5354), and medical enquiries (14.23%, 762/5354). The degree of agreement among professionals as to the annotations was mixed, with the highest consensus demonstrated for the question ""Has the online consultation avoided a face-to-face visit?"" (3/3 professionals agreed 67.95% of the time, 827/1217), and the lowest consensus for the type of use of the teleconsultation (3/3 professionals agreed 57.60% of the time, 701/1217). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the ability of eConsulta to reduce the number of face-to-face visits for 55% (79% × 65%) to 79% of cases. In comparison to previous research, these results are slightly more pessimistic, although the rates are still high and in line with administrative data proxies, showing that 84% of patients using teleconsultations do not make an in-person appointment in the following 3 months. With respect to the type of consultation performed, our results are similar to the existing literature, thus providing robust support for eConsulta's usage.

Experts in the field reported major actions conducted by the FMMS during the COVID-19 pandemic in France. In just few weeks, the FMMS developed ad hoc medical capabilities to support national health authorities. It additionally developed adaptive, collective en route care via aeromedical and naval units and deployed a military intensive care field hospital. A COVID-19 crisis cell coordinated the French Armed Forces health management. The French Military Centre for Epidemiology and Public Health provided all information needed to guide the decision-making process. Medical centres of the French Armed Forces organised the primary care for military patients, with the widespread use of telemedicine. The Paris Fire Brigade and the Marseille Navy Fire Battalion emergency departments ensured prehospital management of patients with COVID-19. The eight French military training hospitals cooperated with civilian regional health agencies. The French military medical supply chain supported all military medical treatment facilities in France as well as overseas, coping with a growing shortage of medical equipment. The French Armed Forces Biomedical Research Institute performed diagnostics, engaged in multiple research projects, updated the review of the scientific literature on COVID-19 daily and provided expert recommendations on biosafety. Finally, even students of the French military medical academy volunteered to participate in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

The effects of lymphatic drainage dysfunction on periodontitis have not been well-studied. Here we show that lymphatic vessel endothelial receptor 1 (LYVE1)+ /podoplanin (PDPN)+ lymphatic vessels (LVs) are increased in the periodontal tissues, with accumulation close to the alveolar bone surface, in two murine periodontitis models: rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-associated periodontitis and ligature-induced periodontitis. Further, PDPN+ / alpha-smooth muscle actin (&#945;SMA)- lymphatic capillaries are increased, whereas PDPN+ / &#945;SMA+ collecting LVs are decreased significantly in the inflamed periodontal tissues. Both mouse models of periodontitis have delayed lymph flow in periodontal tissues, increased TRAP-positive osteoclasts, and significant alveolar bone loss. Importantly, the local administration of adeno-associated virus for vascular endothelial growth factor C, the major growth factor that promotes lymphangiogenesis, increases the area and number of PDPN+ / &#945;SMA+ collecting LVs, promotes local lymphatic drainage, and reduces alveolar bone loss in both models of periodontitis. Lastly, LYVE1+ / &#945;SMA- lymphatic capillaries are increased, whereas LYVE1+ / &#945;SMA+ collecting LVs are decreased significantly in gingival tissues of patients with chronic periodontitis compared with those of clinically healthy controls. Thus, our findings reveal an important role of local lymphatic drainage in periodontal inflammation-mediated alveolar bone loss. This article is protected by copyright.

This multicenter retrospective study describes the rate and severity of hemostatic and thrombotic complications of 400 hospital-admitted COVID-19 patients (144 critically ill) primarily receiving standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation. Coagulation and inflammatory parameters were compared between patients with and without coagulation-associated complications. Multivariable logistic models examined the utility of these markers in predicting coagulation-associated complications, critical illness, and death. The radiographically confirmed VTE rate was 4.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9-7.3), and the overall thrombotic complication rate was 9.5% (95% CI, 6.8-12.8). The overall and major bleeding rates were 4.8% (95% CI, 2.9-7.3) and 2.3% (95% CI, 1.0-4.2), respectively.

METHODS: We described all adults with COVID-19 or influenza discharged from inpatient medical services and medical-surgical intensive care units (ICUs) between Nov. 1, 2019, and June 30, 2020, at 7 hospitals in Toronto and Mississauga, Ontario. We compared patient outcomes using multivariable regression models, controlling for patient sociodemographic factors and comorbidity level. We validated the accuracy of 7 externally developed risk scores to predict mortality among patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: There were 1027 hospital admissions with COVID-19 (median age 65 yr, 59.1% male) and 783 with influenza (median age 68 yr, 50.8% male). Patients younger than 50 years accounted for 21.2% of all admissions for COVID-19 and 24.0% of ICU admissions. Compared with influenza, patients with COVID-19 had significantly greater in-hospital mortality (unadjusted 19.9% v. 6.1%, adjusted relative risk [RR] 3.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.56-4.68), ICU use (unadjusted 26.4% v. 18.0%, adjusted RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.25-1.80) and hospital length of stay (unadjusted median 8.7 d v. 4.8 d, adjusted rate ratio 1.45, 95% CI 1.25-1.69). Thirty-day readmission was not significantly different (unadjusted 9.3% v. 9.6%, adjusted RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.70-1.39). Three points-based risk scores for predicting in-hospital mortality showed good discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] ranging from 0.72 to 0.81) and calibration. INTERPRETATION: During the first wave of the pandemic, admission to hospital for COVID-19 was associated with significantly greater mortality, ICU use and hospital length of stay than influenza. Simple risk scores can predict in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 with good accuracy.","Verma, Amol A; Hora, Tejasvi; Jung, Hae Young; Fralick, Michael; Malecki, Sarah L; Lapointe-Shaw, Lauren; Weinerman, Adina; Tang, Terence; Kwan, Janice L; Liu, Jessica J; Rawal, Shail; Chan, Timothy C Y; Cheung, Angela M; Rosella, Laura C; Ghassemi, Marzyeh; Herridge, Margaret; Mamdani, Muhammad; Razak, Fahad",CMAJ,505,24

We aimed to investigate the association between baseline sarcopenia and clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: All hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 who had baseline chest computed tomography (CT) scans at a Korean university hospital from February 2020 to May 2020 were included. The main outcome was time from hospital admission to discharge. Death was considered as a competing risk for discharge. Baseline skeletal muscle cross-sectional area at the level of the 12th thoracic vertebra was measured from chest CT scans. The lowest quartile of skeletal muscle index (skeletal muscle cross-sectional area divided by height-squared) was defined as sarcopenia. RESULTS: Of 121 patients (median age, 62 years; 44 men; 29 sarcopenic), 7 patients died and 86 patients were discharged during the 60-day follow-up. Patients with sarcopenia showed a longer time to discharge (median, 55 vs 28 days; p < .001) and a higher incidence of death (17.2% vs 2.2%; p = .004) than those without sarcopenia. Baseline sarcopenia was an independent predictor of delayed hospital discharge (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.47; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.23-0.96), but was not independently associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19 (aHR, 3.80; 95% CI, 0.48-30.26). The association between baseline sarcopenia and delayed hospital discharge was consistent in subgroups stratified by age, sex, comorbidities, and severity of COVID-19.

The PHQ-9, GAD-7, and CPDI scales were used to assess the emotional impact. A multinomial logistic regression was performed to measure differences between groups, considering potential confounding factors. RESULTS: Regarding CPDI values, all other groups showed reduced values compared to COVID-19 frontline personnel. However, the general population, preclinical and clinical medical students showed increased PHQ-9 values compared to COVID-19 frontline personnel. Finally, confounding factors, gender and age correlated negatively with higher CPDI and PHQ-9 scores. CONCLUSIONS: Being frontline personnel is associated with increased COVID-19-related stress.

Methods This questionnaire was development based on the COVID-19 relevant guidelines, official documents issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China, and published studies. The development group performed repeated discussions and drafted the first questionnaire, then performed expert consultation and revised the draft according to their suggestions. Eventually, some frontline medical staffs were invited to carry out pre-test investigation of the questionnaire and test its reliability. Results The first draft included 48 items; 18 experts were invited in the first round questionnaire and 10 experts in the second round questionnaire. The positive coefficient of experts in these two rounds was both greater than 75%, and the authority coefficient of experts' opinions was greater than 0.70. The variation coefficient of these items was between 0.00 and 0.35, the coordination coefficient of experts was 0.193 (P&lt;0.05). The experts of above two rounds put forward 14 suggestions for text modification or adjustment options of some items; after the development group held repeatedly discussions, a total of 8 items were performed secondary consultation and finally reached consensus. The final questionnaire included two domains of questionnaire before and after confirmed diagnosis. The domain ""before confirmed diagnosis"" covered 4 sections and 29 items involving infectious cause, plan and knowledge of prevention and control, and psychological symptoms. The domain ""after confirmed diagnosis"" covered 5 sections and 21 items, included symptoms, treatment, and psychological status after diagnosis; impact on the surrounding environment and people, and awareness of protection after infection. The pre-test results showed that the total items were considerably numerous, some items were difficult to understand, some laboratory results and treatment conditions were ambiguous, etc. After modification and re-testing, the test-re-test reliability of each domain was between 0.74 and 0.93, and the overall re-test reliability of the questionnaire content was 0.82.

The Energy Engineering Laboratory Module pedagogy, described elsewhere, provides an underpinning theoretical framework and examples to achieve these features. In addition, instructional lab kits must demonstrate foundational engineering phenomena while maintaining measurement accuracy and fidelity at reasonable cost. In the energy-thermal-fluid sciences, achieving these conditions presents challenges as kits require energy and matter transport and conversion in real time at scales large enough to reveal measurable phenomena but not so large as to become hazardous to users.

Understanding the health consequences of these impacts will be increasingly important in the 'recovery' phase. This article contributes to this understanding by exploring the relationship between unemployment and cardiovascular disease (CVD)-a major contributor to health loss in Aotearoa New Zealand. We reviewed the literature about the impact of unemployment on CVD. The totality of the evidence suggested that increased unemployment arising from economic shocks is associated with increased CVD incidence, particularly for middle-aged men. Continued monitoring and active policy responses are required to prevent increases in CVD (and other health outcomes) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic response. For example, quantifying the CVD-related health loss from pandemic-associated unemployment, along with the health costs and impact on health inequalities, could help with government decision-making to reduce CVD burdens. This could be via intensifying tobacco control, regulating the food supply (eg, to reduce salt/sodium levels), and improving uptake of CVD preventive medications such as statins and anti-hypertensives.","Nghiem, Nhung; Mizdrak, Anja; Wilson, Nick",N Z Med J,505,20

The difficulties lie in computational complexity and how to learn the high-level ideas behind reward functions. We study the graph-based Markov Decision Process (MDP) where the dynamics of neighboring agents are coupled. We use a reward machine (RM) to encode each agent's task and expose reward function internal structures. RM has the capacity to describe high-level knowledge and encode non-Markovian reward functions. We propose a decentralized learning algorithm to tackle computational complexity, called decentralized graph-based reinforcement learning using reward machines (DGRM), that equips each agent with a localized policy, allowing agents to make decisions independently, based on the information available to the agents. DGRM uses the actor-critic structure, and we introduce the tabular Q-function for discrete state problems. We show that the dependency of Q-function on other agents decreases exponentially as the distance between them increases. Furthermore, the complexity of DGRM is related to the local information size of the largest $\kappa$-hop neighborhood, and DGRM can find an $O(\rho^{\kappa+1})$-approximation of a stationary point of the objective function. To further improve efficiency, we also propose the deep DGRM algorithm, using deep neural networks to approximate the Q-function and policy function to solve large-scale or continuous state problems. The effectiveness of the proposed DGRM algorithm is evaluated by two case studies, UAV package delivery and COVID-19 pandemic mitigation. Experimental results show that local information is sufficient for DGRM and agents can accomplish complex tasks with the help of RM. DGRM improves the global accumulated reward by 119% compared to the baseline in the case of COVID-19 pandemic mitigation.","Hu, Jueming; Xu, Zhe; Wang, Weichang; Qu, Guannan; Pang, Yutian; Liu, Yongming",,505,10

The aim of our study is to assess the association of an increased FIB-4 score with COVID-19 disease prognosis. Methods: We performed a prospective study on hospitalized patients with known type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and confirmed COVID-19, with imaging evidence of liver steatosis within the last year or known diagnosis of MAFLD. All individuals were screened for liver fibrosis with a FIB-4 index. We evaluated the link between FIB-4 and disease prognosis. Results: Of 138 participants, 91.3% had MAFLD and 21.5% patients had a high risk of fibrosis. In the latter group of patients, the number of severe forms of disease, the hospital stay length, the rate of ICU admissions and the number of deaths reported registered a statistically significant increase. The independent predictors for developing severe forms of COVID-19 were obesity (odds ratio (OR), 3.24; 95% confidence interval (CI), p = 0.003), higher values of ferritin (OR-1.9; 95% CI, 1.17-8.29, p = 0.031) and of FIB-4 &#8805; 3.25 (OR-4.89; 95% CI, 1.34-12.3, p = 0.02). Conclusions: Patients with high scores of FIB-4 have poor clinical outcomes and liver fibrosis may have a relevant prognostic role. Although the link between liver fibrosis and the prognosis of COVD-19 needs to be evaluated in further studies, screening for liver fibrosis with FIB-4 index, particularly in patients at risk, such as those with T2DM, will make a huge contribution to patient risk stratification.","Calapod, Ovidiu P; Marin, Andreea M; Onisai, Minodora; Tribus, Laura C; Pop, Corina S; Fierbinteanu-Braticevici, Carmen",Medicina (Kaunas),505,24

During times of uncertainty and unexpected change, people have turned to social media platforms as communication tools and primary information sources. Platforms such as Twitter and Sina Weibo have allowed communities to share discussion and emotional support; they also play important roles for individuals, governments, and organizations in exchanging information and expressing opinions. However, research that studies the main concerns expressed by social media users during the pandemic is limited. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the main concerns raised and discussed by citizens on Sina Weibo, the largest social media platform in China, during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We used a web crawler tool and a set of predefined search terms (New Coronavirus Pneumonia, New Coronavirus, and COVID-19) to investigate concerns raised by Sina Weibo users. Textual information and metadata (number of likes, comments, retweets, publishing time, and publishing location) of microblog posts published between December 1, 2019, and July 32, 2020, were collected. After segmenting the words of the collected text, we used a topic modeling technique, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), to identify the most common topics posted by users. We analyzed the emotional tendencies of the topics, calculated the proportional distribution of the topics, performed user behavior analysis on the topics using data collected from the number of likes, comments, and retweets, and studied the changes in user concerns and differences in participation between citizens living in different regions of mainland China. RESULTS: Based on the 203,191 eligible microblog posts collected, we identified 17 topics and grouped them into 8 themes. These topics were pandemic statistics, domestic epidemic, epidemics in other countries worldwide, COVID-19 treatments, medical resources, economic shock, quarantine and investigation, patients' outcry for help, work and production resumption, psychological influence, joint prevention and control, material donation, epidemics in neighboring countries, vaccine development, fueling and saluting antiepidemic action, detection, and study resumption. The mean sentiment was positive for 11 topics and negative for 6 topics. The topic with the highest mean of retweets was domestic epidemic, while the topic with the highest mean of likes was quarantine and investigation. CONCLUSIONS: Concerns expressed by social media users are highly correlated with the evolution of the global pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, social media has provided a platform for Chinese government departments and organizations to better understand public concerns and demands. Similarly, social media has provided channels to disseminate information about epidemic prevention and has influenced public attitudes and behaviors. Government departments, especially those related to health, can create appropriate policies in a timely manner through monitoring social media platforms to guide public opinion and behavior during epidemics.","Wang, Junze; Zhou, Ying; Zhang, Wei; Evans, Richard; Zhu, Chengyan",J Med Internet Res,505,9

Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a multivariate analysis method to determine the structural relationship between measured variables. This observational study aimed to use SEM to determine the effects of social support on sleep quality and function of medical staff who treated patients with COVID-19 in January and February 2020 in Wuhan, China. MATERIAL AND METHODS A one-month cross-sectional observational study included 180 medical staff who treated patients with COVID-19 infection. Levels of anxiety, self-efficacy, stress, sleep quality, and social support were measured using the and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction (SASR) questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Social Support Rate Scale (SSRS), respectively. Pearson's correlation analysis and SEM identified the interactions between these factors. RESULTS Levels of social support for medical staff were significantly associated with self-efficacy and sleep quality and negatively associated with the degree of anxiety and stress. Levels of anxiety were significantly associated with the levels of stress, which negatively impacted self-efficacy and sleep quality. Anxiety, stress, and self-efficacy were mediating variables associated with social support and sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS SEM showed that medical staff in China who were treating patients with COVID-19 infection during January and February 2020 had levels of anxiety, stress, and self-efficacy that were dependent on sleep quality and social support.","Xiao, Han; Zhang, Yan; Kong, Desheng; Li, Shiyue; Yang, Ningxi",Med Sci Monit,505,13

METHODS: Non-critically ill individuals with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests admitted between 7 February and 12 February 2020 to Dongxihu Fangcang Hospital, which was promptly constructed because of the rapid, exponential increase in COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, were included; clinical course through to 22 February was recorded. RESULTS: A total of 1012 non-critically ill individuals with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests were included in the study. Thirty (of 1012, 3.0%) individuals were asymptomatic on admission. During hospitalization, 16 of 30 (53.3%) asymptomatic individuals developed different symptoms. Fourteen of 1012 patients (1.4%) remained asymptomatic from exposure to the end of follow up, with a median duration of 24 days (interquartile range 22-27). Fever (761 of 1012, 75.2%) and cough (531 of 1012, 52.4%) were the most common symptoms.

In addition, in recent decades considering their immunomodulatory effects, high tolerably, and low cost, they are evaluated for various viral infections from HIV to COVID-19. AREAS COVERED: In this review, we tried to summarize all available studies on HCQ and CQ efficacy for management of viral infections and the probable mechanisms of action. The data were collected by searching 'Hydroxychloroquine,' 'Chloroquine,' 'Viral infection,' and names of various viral infections in PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases from commencement to June 2020. Out of 95 search results, 74 most relevant works were gathered. EXPERT OPINION: HCQ/CQ showed acceptable efficacy in HIV especially as an adjuvant treatment beside routine HAART. However, for some viral infections such as ZIKA, EBOLA, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, human studies are lacking. In the COVID-19 pandemic, in vitro and preliminary human studies showed encouraging findings. However, later well-designed trials and retrospective studies with large sample size not only reported non-significant efficacy but also showed more cardiac adverse reactions. Alkalinization of acid vesicles is the most important mechanism of action.","Naghipour, Sara; Ghodousi, Mahsa; Rahsepar, Sara; Elyasi, Sepideh",Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,505,1

Public safety net healthcare systems play a critical role in facilitating access to care for refugees and informing coordinated public health prevention and mitigation efforts during a pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence ratios of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection between refugee women and nonrefugee parturient patients admitted to the hospital for delivery. Here, we suspected that the burden of infection was disproportionately distributed across refugee communities that may act as sentinels for community outbreaks. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted examining parturient women admitted to the maternity unit between May 6, 2020, and July 22, 2020, when universal testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was first employed. Risk factors for severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 positivity were ascertained, disaggregated by refugee status, and other clinical and sociodemographic variables examined. Prevalence ratios were calculated and comparisons made to county-level community prevalence over the same period. RESULTS: The positive test percentage at the county-level during this study period was 21.6%. Of 350 women admitted to the hospital for delivery, 33 (9.4%) tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome 2. When refugee status was determined, 45 women (12.8%) were identified as refugees. Of the 45 refugee women, 8 (17.8%) tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 compared with 25 nonrefugee patients (8.19%) who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (prevalence ratio, 2.16;95% confidence interval, 1.04-4.51). In addition, 7 of the refugee women who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were from Central Africa. CONCLUSION: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 outbreak has disproportionately affected refugee populations. This study highlighted the utility of universal screening in mounting a rapid response to an evolving pandemic and how we can better serve refugee communities. Focused response may help achieve more equitable care related to severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 among vulnerable communities. The identification of such populations may help mitigate the spread of the disease and facilitate a timely, culturally, and linguistically enhanced public health response.","Johnson-Agbakwu, C.

To further clarify the factors influencing their behaviours, this study used a questionnaire to survey a sample of 556 individuals in China and used multiple linear regression and analysis of variance to explore influencing factors during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We found that, first, in the COVID-19 pandemic, middle-aged and elderly adults' willingness to re-spread rumours is positively related to their degree of believing rumours and to personal anxiety and is negatively related to their rumour-discrimination ability and to their perception of serious consequences to rumour spreading. Second, the degree of believing rumours plays an intermediary role in the willingness to re-spread rumours. It plays a partial mediating role in the path of anxiety's influence on behaviour, suggesting that an anxious person will spread a rumour even if he or she does not have a strong belief in the rumour. Third, interpersonal communication has a greater credibility and a greater willingness to re-spread than does mass communication. This suggests the importance of increasing public knowledge expertise and of reducing public panic. This also has important implications for the future design of public health policies.","Sun, Zhonggen; Cheng, Xin; Zhang, Ruilian; Yang, Bingqing",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),505,29

Few, if any, CABs comprised of youth participants exist. In 2019, a Midwest medical center recruited a diverse group of 18 11–17-year-old community members to a Pediatric Advisory Board (PAB) to provide feedback on the recruitment and involvement of minors in research.Methods:Semi-structured interviews with n = 12 PAB members were conducted to understand their experiences and views on participating in the PAB. Parents (n = 7) were interviewed separately to assess the congruence of views on PAB membership between parents and their children. Interview transcripts were qualitatively analyzed to identify iterative themes.Results:PAB members thought the PAB addressed an unmet need of soliciting feedback from youth to develop age-appropriate study materials and to understand potential concerns of young participants. While PAB members expressed interest in the research topics presented by researchers, a few members indicated barriers to full participation, including lack of self-confidence, anxiety, and discomfort sharing opinions in a group setting. Parents supported their child’s PAB participation and hoped it would help them build confidence in developing and sharing their opinions in ways that were meaningful for them, which PAB members largely reported occurring over their period of involvement.Conclusion:Findings from a novel Midwest PAB indicated benefits to PAB members. While contributing to pediatric research planning by providing feedback on recruiting youth and improving study protocols, they gained confidence in providing opinions on biomedical research and developed their scientific literacy.","Dsouza, Karen N.; Orellana, Minerva Riggan Kirsten A.; Valdez-Soto, Miguel Brockman Tabetha A.; Zavala Rocha, Maria Guadalupe Balls-Berry Joyce E.; Young, Juhn Patten Christi A.; Allyse, Megan A.",Journal of Clinical and Translational Science,505,14

The early detection of infected patients is effective in fighting COVID19. Using radiology (X-Ray) images is, perhaps, the fastest way to diagnose the patients. Thereby, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be considered as applicable tools to diagnose COVID19 positive cases. Due to the complicated architecture of a deep CNN, its real-time training and testing become a challenging problem. This paper proposes using the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) instead of the last fully connected layer to address this deficiency. However, the parameters' stochastic tuning of ELM's supervised section causes the final model unreliability. Therefore, to cope with this problem and maintain network reliability, the sine-cosine algorithm was utilized to tune the ELM's parameters. The designed network is then benchmarked on the COVID-Xray-5k dataset, and the results are verified by a comparative study with canonical deep CNN, ELM optimized by cuckoo search, ELM optimized by genetic algorithm, and ELM optimized by whale optimization algorithm. The proposed approach outperforms comparative benchmarks with a final accuracy of 98.83% on the COVID-Xray-5k dataset, leading to a relative error reduction of 2.33% compared to a canonical deep CNN. Even more critical, the designed network's training time is only 0.9421 ms and the overall detection test time for 3100 images is 2.721 s.","Wu, Chao; Khishe, Mohammad; Mohammadi, Mokhtar; Taher Karim, Sarkhel H; Rashid, Tarik A",Soft comput,505,3

However, the pathogenesis underlying COVID-19 are barely understood. METHODS: In this study, we performed proteomic analyses of airway mucus obtained by bronchoscopy from severe COVID-19 patients. In total, 2351 and 2073 proteins were identified and quantified in COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, respectively. RESULTS: Among them, 92 differentiated expressed proteins (DEPs) (46 up-regulated and 46 down-regulated) were found with a fold change >1.5 or <0.67 and a p-value <0.05, and 375 proteins were uniquely present in airway mucus from COVID-19 patients. Pathway and network enrichment analyses revealed that the 92 DEPs were mostly associated with metabolic, complement and coagulation cascades, lysosome, and cholesterol metabolism pathways, and the 375 COVID-19 only proteins were mainly enriched in amino acid degradation (Valine, Leucine and Isoleucine degradation), amino acid metabolism (beta-Alanine, Tryptophan, Cysteine and Methionine metabolism), oxidative phosphorylation, phagosome, and cholesterol metabolism pathways.

This question could be critical especially if many people rush to single occupancy vehicles. To this end, we estimate how congestion will increases as the number of cars increase on the road, and identify the most sensitive cites to drop in transit usage. Travel time and mode share data from the American Community Survey of the US Census Bureau, for metro areas across the US. A BPR model is used to relate average travel times to the estimated number of commuters traveling by car. We then evaluate increased vehicle volumes on the road if different portions of transit and car pool users switch to single-occupancy vehicles, and report the resulting travel time from the BPR model. The scenarios predict that cities with large transit ridership are at risk for extreme traffic unless transit systems can resume safe, high throughput operations quickly.","Hu, Yue; Barbour, William; Samaranayake, Samitha; Work, Dan",,505,16

Austerity is presented through the notions of retrenchment, decentralisation and shifts in governance. The analysis shows that retrenchment and decentralisation eroded the capacity of public institutions to protect the provision of vital public services. This is revealed through the reduced provision of non-statutory services and the reinforcement of inequalities in service provision. Shifts in governance have led to mixed outcomes in the quality of services. This article also addresses how austerity influenced many of the problems observed in service provision during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Understanding risk of deterioration will assist in admission and discharge decisions, and help selection for clinical studies to indicate where risk of therapy-related complications is justified. METHODS: An observational cohort of patients acutely admitted to two London hospitals with COVID-19 and positive SARS-CoV-2 swab results was assessed. Demographic details, clinical data, comorbidities, blood parameters and chest radiograph severity scores were collected from electronic health records. Endpoints assessed were critical care admission and death. A risk score was developed to predict outcomes. FINDINGS: Analyses included 1,157 patients. Older age, male sex, comorbidities, respiratory rate, oxygenation, radiographic severity, higher neutrophils, higher CRP and lower albumin at presentation predicted critical care admission and mortality. Non-white ethnicity predicted critical care admission but not death. Social deprivation was not predictive of outcome. A risk score was developed incorporating twelve characteristics: age>40, male, non-white ethnicity, oxygen saturations<93%, radiological severity score>3, neutrophil count>8.0 x109/L, CRP>40â¯mg/L, albumin<34â¯g/L, creatinine>100â¯µmol/L, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and chronic lung disease. Risk scores of 4 or higher corresponded to a 28-day cumulative incidence of critical care admission or death of 40.7% (95% CI: 37.1 to 44.4), versus 12.4% (95% CI: 8.2 to 16.7) for scores less than 4. INTERPRETATION: Our study identified predictors of critical care admission and death in people admitted to hospital with COVID-19. These predictors were incorporated into a risk score that will inform clinical care and stratify patients for clinical trials.","Galloway, James B; Norton, Sam; Barker, Richard D; Brookes, Andrew; Carey, Ivana; Clarke, Benjamin D; Jina, Raeesa; Reid, Carole; Russell, Mark D; Sneep, Ruth; Sugarman, Leah; Williams, Sarah; Yates, Mark; Teo, James; Shah, Ajay M; Cantle, Fleur",J Infect,505,1

Here we explore the idea that an exacerbated inflammatory response, in particular that mediated by IL-6, may drive the deleterious consequences of the infection. Data shows that other RNA viruses, such as influenza virus, can display enhanced replication efficiency in senescent cells, suggesting that the accumulation of senescent cells with aging and age-related diseases may play a role in this phenomenon. However, at present, we are completely unaware of the response to SARS-CoV and SARS-COV-2 occurring in senescent cells. We deem that this is a priority area of research because it could lead to the development of several therapeutic strategies based on senotherapeutics or prevent unsuccessful attempts. Two of these senotherapeutics, azithromycin and ruxolitinib, are currently undergoing testing for their efficacy in treating COVID-19. The potential of these strategies is not only for ameliorating the consequences of the current emergence of SARS-CoV-2, but also for the future emergence of new viruses or mutated ones for which we are completely unprepared and for which no vaccines are available.","Malavolta, Marco; Giacconi, Robertina; Brunetti, Dario; Provinciali, Mauro; Maggi, Fabrizio",,505,13

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify the symptoms, comorbidities present, radiological features and outcomes for adults testing positive for COVID-19 admitted to hospital. The results across multiple studies were numerically pooled to yield total estimated. RESULTS: A total of 45 studies were included in this review with 14,358 adult participants (average age 51 years, male 51%). The pooled findings suggest that the most common symptom among patients was fever (81.2%) followed by cough (62.9%), fatigue (38.0%) and anorexia/loss of appetite (33.7%). The comorbidities that were most prevalent among patients with the virus were hypertension (19.1%), cardiovascular disease (17.9%), endocrine disorder (9.3%) and diabetes (9.2%). Abnormal chest X-ray findings were present in 27.7% of patients and ground-glass opacity was demonstrated on chest CT in 63.0% of patients. The most frequent adverse outcomes were acute respiratory distress syndrome (27.4%), acute cardiac injury (16.2%) and acute kidney injury (12.6%). Death occurred in 8.2% of patients and 16.3% required intensive care admission and 11.7% had mechanical ventilation. Bacterial or secondary infections affected 8.5% of patients and 6.9% developed shock. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 most commonly presents with fever, cough, fatigue and anorexia among patients with existing hypertension and cardiovascular disease. It is important as serious adverse outcomes can develop such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury and death.","Bennett, Sadie; Tafuro, Jaco; Mayer, Joseph; Darlington, Dan; Wai Wong, Chun; Muntean, Elena-Andra; Wong, Nicholas; Mallen, Christian; Shing Kwok, Chun",Int J Clin Pract,505,24

We present the impact of different dissemination strategies to collect data from a non-probabilistic convenience sample and outline post-stratification weighting schemes, to provide guidance for future multi-country survey studies. METHODS: Description and comparison of dissemination strategies for five exemplary countries (Czechia, Germany, Lithuania, Norway, Spain) participating in the Alcohol Use and COVID-19 Survey. Comparison of the sample distribution with the country's actual population distribution according to sociodemographics, and development of weighting schemes. RESULTS: The dissemination of online surveys through national newspapers, paid social media adverts and dissemination with the support of national health ministries turned out to be the most effective strategies. Monitoring the responses and adapting dissemination strategies to reach under-represented groups, and the application of sample weights were helpful to achieve an analytic sample matching the respective general population profiles. CONCLUSION: Reaching a large pan-European convenience sample, including most European countries, in a short time was feasible, with the support of a broad scientific network.","Kilian, Carolin; Rehm, Jürgen; Allebeck, Peter; Barták, Miroslav; Braddick, Fleur; Gual, Antoni; Matrai, Silvia; Petruzelka, Benjamin; Rogalewicz, Vladimir; Rossow, Ingeborg; Schulte, Bernd; Stelemekas, Mindaugas; Manthey, Jakob",Int. j. methods psychiatr. res.

Predisposing risk factors could include poor dietary quality and at-risk alcohol use. Increased survival and aging of people living with HIV (PLWH) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) is complicated by comorbidities including at-risk alcohol use, metabolic dysregulation, diabetes, and chronic renal disease, with obesity and metabolic syndrome highest in southern states. We hypothesize that poor dietary quality in combination with at-risk alcohol use may increase risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection in PLWH. To test this hypothesis, biospecimen obtained from a longitudinal study in female rhesus macaques (macaca mulatta) were used to determine whether high-fat high-sucrose diet (HFD;protein/fat/carbohydrates 16/42/42% of total kcal and 27% sucrose by weight) and chronic binge alcohol administration (CBA) increased expression of the machinery required for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Female macaques (n=10) were assigned to HFD or standard chow diet (SD;protein/fat/carbohydrates 29/14/57% of total kcal) and CBA (50-60 mM peak blood alcohol, 5 days/week) or isovolumetric water (VEH) beginning 3 months before SIVmac251 infection. ART was initiated at 2.5 months of SIV infection. Tissue samples including lung, pancreas, and kidney were collected at study endpoint (~12 months post-SIV infection). Immunohistochemistry was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded samples to determine protein expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). Images were obtained at 20x magnification and fluorescence intensity was used for quantification. RNA was extracted from frozen samples and mRNA expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was measured by qPCR and quantified relative to ribosomal protein S13. Normality of data was verified and outliers identified using Grubbs test. Data were then analyzed using a 2 (alcohol) ? 2 (diet) ANOVA. Protein expression of ACE2 in the lung (p&lt;0.01, ?2=0.59), whole pancreas (p&lt;0.05, ?2=0.64), and pancreatic islets (p&lt;0.05, ?2=0.44) was greater in HFD- than SD-fed macaques and was not significantly altered by CBA. No alcohol- or diet-mediated differences in ACE2 protein expression were observed for whole kidney or proximal tubules. No alcohol- or diet-mediated differences in protein expression of TMPRSS2 or relative mRNA expression of ACE2 or TMPRSS2 were observed. Results indicate that a high-fat, high-sucrose diet increases expression of the ACE2 receptor in SIV-infected female macaques. Because the ACE2 receptor is required for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, this diet-mediated increase in expression may increase risk for greater vulnerability to COVID-19 disease and associated complications. These data provide direct evidence for a link between dietary quality and risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the context of SIV/HIV infection, urging diet counseling and increased access to higher-quality foods in this population.","Levitt, Danielle Delery Elizabeth Simon Liz Molina Patricia",The FASEB Journal,505,24

Methods: This cross-sectional study used data obtained from an online survey administered to 120 women who were pregnant and gave birth during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. The psychological condition of pregnant women was measured using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 questionnaire which was modified for conditions experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. We classified pregnant women into 2 groups according to their psychological condition: pregnant women who experienced anxiety and pregnant women who did not experience anxiety or felt normal. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was undertaken for the 2 groups. This study also used univariate analysis and bivariate analysis. Results: The results of the ROC analysis resulted in a cutoff score of 3.56. The proportion of respondents who felt anxious was 53.3% and the proportion of respondents who did not feel anxious or felt normal was 46.7%. Anxiety was most common among pregnant women with high education levels, gestational age &lt;19 weeks, and working pregnant women. Conclusion: Maternal health services need to be performed with strict health protocols, complemented by pregnancy counseling services.

Participants answered four instruments in addition to sociodemographic questions: Gendered Racial Microaggression Scale, Goldberg General Health Questionnaire, Group Identification Scale, and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. The results indicate that the high frequency of gendered racial microaggressions predicts worse levels of mental health and self-esteem. Self-esteem mediates the relationship between microaggressions and general health. It is a protective factor of mental health. Identity moderates this relationship, so that a high identification as a black woman is related to lower levels of mental health when faced with a high frequency of discriminatory events. Despite some limitations, the objectives were achieved. Future studies should contribute with explanations of the relationship between gendered racial microaggressions and mental health.","Martins, Tafnes Varela; Lima, Tiago Jessé Souza de; Santos, Walberto Silva",Cien Saude Colet,505,16

Carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa was more frequently isolated from patients admitted in non-COVID-19 ICUs. Several conditions favor the increased frequency of these infections by antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. Among all, the severity of the respiratory tracts was definitely decisive, which required assisted ventilation with invasive procedures. The turnover in the ICU of a large number of patients in a very short time requiring urgent invasive interventions has favored the not always suitable execution of assistance procedures. No less important is the increased exposure to infectious risk from bacteria and fungi in patients with severe impairment due to ventilation.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic demands a response to prevent a peak in the prevalence of mental health problems and to avoid the collapse of mental health services, which are scarce and inaccessible due to the pandemic. Thus, this study aimed to review articles on the effectiveness of bibliotherapy on different mental health problems. Methods: A systematic review was conducted to examine relevant studies that assess the effectiveness of bibliotherapy in different clinical settings as a treatment capable of enhancing a sense of purpose and its surrounding values. To achieve this, a systematic review, including a bioethical meta-analysis, was performed. A variant of the PICO (Participants, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) model was used for the search strategy, and the systematic review was conducted in three databases: PubMed, Bireme, and OVID. Inclusion criteria were relevant studies that included the keywords, excluding documents with irrelevant topics, studies on subjects 15 years or younger, and in languages besides Spanish or English. Starting with 707 studies, after three rounds of different quality criteria, 13 articles were selected for analysis, including a hermeneutic analysis, which was followed by a fourth and final recovery round assessing bibliotherapy articles concerning healthcare workers. Results: Our findings showed that through bibliotherapy, patients developed several capacities, including the re-signification of their own activities through a new outlook of their moral horizon. There are no research road maps serving as guides to conduct research on the use of bibliotherapy to enhance mental health. Additionally, values such as autonomy and justice were closely linked with positive results in bibliotherapy. This implies that bibliotherapy has the potential to have a positive impact in different settings. Conclusions: Our contribution is to offer a road map that presents state-of-the-art bibliotherapy research, which will assist institutions and healthcare professionals to plan clinical and specific interventions with positive outcomes.","Monroy-Fraustro, Daniela; Maldonado-Castellanos, Isaac; Aboites-Molina, Mónica; Rodríguez, Susana; Sueiras, Perla; Altamirano-Bustamante, Nelly F; de Hoyos-Bermea, Adalberto; Altamirano-Bustamante, Myriam M",Front Public Health,505,5

METHODS: Data from COVID-19 cases were collected from daily notifications given to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China and Tianjin Health Committee. All of the data were analyzed with SPSS, version 24.0 software (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). RESULTS: As of February 24, 2020, there have been 135 confirmed cases, 3 deaths, and 87 recoveries in Tianjin, China. The incidence of COVID-19 was 8.65/1 000 000 with a 2.22% case fatality rate. Regarding geographic distribution, the incidence was 8.82 per 1 000 000 in urban areas and 8.00 per 1 000 000 in suburbs. During the early stage of the epidemic, most cases came from urban areas and in patients with a history of sojourning in Hubei Province. The majority of patients were 31-70 years old (75.97%).

In March 2020, stringent national restrictions were enforced in the UK to protect public health and slow the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Restrictions were likely to have resulted in collateral consequences for the health and welfare of horses and ponies, especially those at risk of obesity and laminitis and this issue warranted more detailed exploration. The current study utilised qualitative methodology to investigate the implications of COVID-19 related policies upon equine management and welfare with a focus on horses and ponies at risk of laminitis and obesity. Twenty-four interviews with five sub-groups of key equestrian welfare stakeholders in the UK were conducted between May and July of 2020 to understand the challenges facing equine welfare in the context of laminitis and obesity susceptible animals. Thematic analysis revealed lockdown-associated factors with the potential to compromise welfare of horses and ponies at risk of obesity and laminitis. These included: disparate information and guidance, difficulties enacting public health measures in yard environments, and horses having reduced exercise during the pandemic. Positive examples of clear and consistent information sharing by farriers were reported to have improved horse owner understanding of routine hoof care during lockdown.

It is only public health measures, such as social distancing (and these included school closures), that have prevented millions of infections and deaths. School closures followed a precautionary principle in that many previous epidemics (e.g. influenza) were mainly transmitted by children. This is supported by few studies and yet, these closures have significantly impacted parents and children. We are now in September 2020, with public health restrictions being lifted in an attempt to attenuate the negative economic impact of the pandemic. The easing of restrictions has led to a resurgence of COVID-19 in a second wave of infections. In the meantime, summer school holidays are coming to an end in the northern hemisphere and it is salutary to review the effects on viral surges due to school openings thus far. This review shows that as schools open, outbreaks that affect both pupils and staff occur probably due to failure to adhere to public health principles: hand washing, distancing etc. Reopenings should clearly be done slowly and cautiously so as to control potential COVID-19 outbreaks before they get out of hand. Reopenings may also require targeted closure of other establishments/facilities (such as restaurants and shops) so as to keep the locality's COVID-19 reproduction rate below 1.","Grech, Victor; Grech, Elizabeth; Borg Myatt, Jeremy",Early Hum Dev,505,27

Purpose: To explore the risk factors for nosocomial bacterial infection of patients with COVID-19, and further to provide a theoretical basis for scientific prevention and control of nosocomial bacterial infection. Methods: Between 10 January 2020 and 9 March 2020, we collected data of 212 patients with COVID-19 and then explored the influence of age, gender, length of stay, use of ventilator, urinary catheterization, central venous catheterization, white blood cell (WBC) count and procalcitonin on the nosocomial bacterial infection of patients with COVID-19 by a retrospective study. Results: There were 212 confirmed cases of COVID-19, of which 31 cases had nosocomial bacterial infections, with an incidence of 14.62%. The most common types of nosocomial bacterial infections were lower respiratory tract (12 cases, 38.71%), which was the most frequent site, followed by urinary tract (10 cases, 32.26%), blood stream (7 cases, 22.58%), upper respiratory tract (1 case, 3.23%) and gastrointestinal tract infection (1 case, 3.23%). The incidence of nosocomial bacterial infection was significantly correlated with age, arteriovenous catheterization, urinary catheterization, WBC count and procalcitonin. Moreover, multivariate analysis confirmed that WBC (OR 8.38, 95% CI 1.07 to 65.55), procalcitonin (OR 4.92, 95% CI 1.39 to 17.33) and urinary catheterization (OR 25.38, 95% CI 5.09 to 126.53) were independent risk factors for the nosocomial bacterial infection of patients with COVID-19. Conclusion: Understanding the risk factors for nosocomial bacterial infection of patients with COVID-19 and strengthening the monitoring of various susceptible factors are helpful to control the occurrence of nosocomial bacterial infection in the COVID-19 isolation wards.","Cheng, Keping; He, Miao; Shu, Qin; Wu, Ming; Chen, Cuifang; Xue, Yulei",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,505,10

Purpose To investigate the diagnostic value and consistency of chest CT as compared with comparison to RT-PCR assay in COVID-19. Methods From January 6 to February 6, 2020, 1014 patients in Wuhan, China who underwent both chest CT and RT-PCR tests were included. With RT-PCR as reference standard, the performance of chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19 was assessed. Besides, for patients with multiple RT-PCR assays, the dynamic conversion of RT-PCR results (negative to positive, positive to negative, respectively) was analyzed as compared with serial chest CT scans for those with time-interval of 4 days or more. Results Of 1014 patients, 59% (601/1014) had positive RT-PCR results, and 88% (888/1014) had positive chest CT scans. The sensitivity of chest CT in suggesting COVID-19 was 97% (95%CI, 95-98%, 580/601 patients) based on positive RT-PCR results. In patients with negative RT-PCR results, 75% (308/413) had positive chest CT findings; of 308, 48% were considered as highly likely cases, with 33% as probable cases. By analysis of serial RT-PCR assays and CT scans, the mean interval time between the initial negative to positive RT-PCR results was 5.1 ± 1.5 days; the initial positive to subsequent negative RT-PCR result was 6.9 ± 2.3 days). 60% to 93% of cases had initial positive CT consistent with COVID-19 prior (or parallel) to the initial positive RT-PCR results. 42% (24/57) cases showed improvement in follow-up chest CT scans before the RT-PCR results turning negative. Conclusion Chest CT has a high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19. Chest CT may be considered as a primary tool for the current COVID-19 detection in epidemic areas.","Ai, Tao; Yang, Zhenlu; Hou, Hongyan; Zhan, Chenao; Chen, Chong; Lv, Wenzhi; Tao, Qian; Sun, Ziyong; Xia, Liming",Radiology,505,30

Postoperative apathy cannot always be related to a dose reduction of dopaminergic medication and stimulation itself may play a role. OBJECTIVE: We studied whether apathy in DBS-treated PD patients could be a stimulation effect. METHODS: In 26 PD patients we acquired apathy scores before and >6 months after DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Magnetoencephalography recordings (ON and OFF stimulation) were performed >6 months after DBS placement. Change in apathy severity was correlated with (i) improvement in motor function and dose reduction of dopaminergic medication, (ii) stimulation location (merged MRI and CT-scans) and (iii) stimulation-related changes in functional connectivity of brain regions that have an alleged role in apathy. RESULTS: Average apathy severity significantly increased after DBS (p<0.001) and the number of patients considered apathetic increased from two to nine. Change in apathy severity did not correlate with improvement in motor function or dose reduction of dopaminergic medication. For the left hemisphere, increase in apathy was associated with a more dorsolateral stimulation location (p=0.010). The increase in apathy severity correlated with a decrease in alpha1 functional connectivity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (p=0.006), but not with changes of the medial orbitofrontal or the anterior cingulate cortex. CONCLUSIONS: The present observations suggest that apathy after STN-DBS is not necessarily related to dose reductions of dopaminergic medication, but may be an effect of the stimulation itself. This highlights the importance of determining optimal DBS settings based on both motor and non-motor symptoms.","Boon, Lennard I; Potters, Wouter V; Zoon, Thomas J C; van den Heuvel, Odile A; Prent, Naomi; Bie, Rob M A de; Bot, Maarten; Schuurman, P Richard; van den Munckhof, Pepijn; Geurtsen, Gert J; Hillebrand, Arjan; Stam, Cornelis J; Rootselaar, Anne-Fleur van; Berendse, Henk W",Brain stimul,505,30

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ophthalmic examination, optical coherence tomography, fundus autofluorescence and microperimetry were performed at baseline and every 6-12 months. Baseline and annual change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), microperimetry mean sensitivity (MS) and number of scotoma loci, residual ellipsoid zone (EZ) span and hyperautofluorescent ring (HAR) area were reported. Next-generation and Sanger sequencing were performed in available members. RESULTS: 12 affected members from three generations were examined. Mean (SD, range) age at onset of symptoms was 11 (4.5, 4-19) years. MS declined steadily from the third decade and EZ span and HAR area declined rapidly during the second decade. Serial microperimetry showed negligible change in MS over 2-3 years.

We performed a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis to determine the range of liver stiffness in healthy children and evaluate the influence of important biological parameters. METHODS: We pooled data from 10 studies that examined healthy children using transient elastography. We divided 1702 children into two groups: &#8805; 3 years (older group) and < 3 years of age (younger group). Univariate and multivariate linear regression models predicting liver stiffness were conducted. RESULTS: After excluding children with obesity, diabetes, or abnormal liver tests, 652 children were analyzed. Among older children, mean liver stiffness was 4.45 kPa (95% confidence interval 4.34-4.56), and increased liver stiffness was associated with age, sedation status, and S probe use. In the younger group, the mean liver stiffness was 4.79 kPa (95% confidence interval 4.46-5.12), and increased liver stiffness was associated with sedation status and Caucasian race. In a subgroup analysis, hepatic steatosis on ultrasound was significantly associated with increased liver stiffness. We define a reference range for normal liver stiffness in healthy children as 2.45-5.56 kPa. CONCLUSIONS: We have established transient elastography-derived liver stiffness ranges for healthy children and propose an upper limit of liver stiffness in healthy children to be 5.56 kPa. We have identified increasing age, use of sedation, probe size and presence of steatosis on ultrasound as factors that can significantly increase liver stiffness.","Li, Darrick K; Rehan Khan, Muhammad; Wang, Zhen; Chongsrisawat, Voranush; Swangsak, Panida; Teufel-Schäfer, Ulrike; Engelmann, Guido; Goldschmidt, Imeke; Baumann, Ulrich; Tokuhara, Daisuke; Cho, Yuki; Rowland, Marion; Mjelle, Anders B; Ramm, Grant A; Lewindon, Peter J; Witters, Peter; Cassiman, David; Ciuca, Ioana M; Prokop, Larry D; Haffar, Samir; Corey, Kathleen E; Hassan Murad, M; Furuya, Katryn N; Bazerbachi, Fateh",Liver int,505,17

OBJECTIVE: In this context, we decided to study certain consequences of the abundant cytokine release over the innate and adaptive immune systems, inflammation, and hemostasis, comparing mild and severe forms of COVID-19. METHODS: To accomplish these aims, we will analyze demographic characteristics, biochemical tests, immune biomarkers, leukocyte phenotyping, immunoglobulin profile, hormonal release (cortisol and prolactin), gene expression, thromboelastometry, neutralizing antibodies, metabolic profile, and neutrophil function (reactive oxygen species production, neutrophil extracellular trap production, phagocytosis, migration, gene expression, and proteomics). A total of 200 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-confirmed patients will be enrolled and divided into two groups: mild/moderate or severe/critical forms of COVID-19. Blood samples will be collected at different times: at inclusion and after 9 and 18 days, with an additional 3-day sample for severe patients. We believe that this information will provide more knowledge for future studies that will provide more robust and useful clinical information that may allow for better decisions at the front lines of health care. RESULTS: The recruitment began in June 2020 and is still in progress. It is expected to continue until February 2021. Data analysis is scheduled to start after all data have been collected.

In general, 15% to 22% of the general population are estimated to have low olfactory function, and their prevalence rate has increased during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, raising global awareness as to how olfactory disorders can affect our quality of life. Notably, the most frequent issues reported by individuals with olfactory disorders are observed in food-related experiences. Because previous studies have advanced conflicting results in this regard, this review deals with current perspectives on the impacts of olfactory disorders on food perception, food enjoyment, food-evoked emotions, and dietary patterns. The strategies suggested in this review will provide a better understanding of how to improve eating-related quality of life among individuals with olfactory disorders.","Seo, Han-Seok Pramudya Ragita C.; Singh, Asmita Hummel Thomas",Current Opinion in Food Science,505,24

In October 2020, the Japanese law on immunization was revised, which resulted in a few laudable achievements. First, rotavirus vaccines were added to the NIP, 10 years after their introduction, and noteworthy studies of vaccine effectiveness and the incidence of intussusception in Japanese children were published. Second, rules on vaccine intervals-which had been a longstanding concern-were withdrawn. In addition to this revision of the law, the Japanese version of the Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) was released by the Japan Pediatric Society in 2018. The VIS provides useful caregiver information on general immunization concepts and individual vaccines. Further challenges for the Japanese immunization program include (1) administering a booster dose of pertussis-containing vaccine to preschool children or teenagers, (2) reestablishing the active recommendation for human papilloma virus vaccines, (3) adding the mumps and influenza vaccines to the NIP, and (4) ensuring optimal dosing of seasonal influenza vaccines. During the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, vaccination rates among children have been decreasing in many countries. In Japan, vaccination rates have been stable in infants, but declining among toddlers and school-aged children, despite public awareness of the need for timely administration of vaccines during the pandemic. Clearly, further action is needed if we are to adequately protect children living in Japan from vaccine-preventable diseases.","Saitoh, Akihiko; Okabe, Nobuhiko",Vaccine,505,9

The analysis is divided into three parts and addresses problematic issues associated with different stages of the pandemic. In the first part of the paper, the author outlines the asylum practices of EU Member States in the initial stage of the Covid-19 pandemic during which the pandemic was perceived as a state of emergency. By exploring the legal possibilities to derogate both from the EU asylum rules and international human rights standards, the author offers conclusions as regards limits of derogations and the legality of Member States' practices, especially their failure to differentiate between rules that are susceptive of being derogated in emergency situations and those that are not. The second part of the paper analyses the current phase of the pandemic in which it is perceived as a 'new normal' and focuses on making the EU asylum system immune to Covid-19 influence to the greatest extent possible and in line with relevant EU and human rights rules. The author insists on the vulnerability as an inherent feature of persons in need of international protection and researches upon the relationship between the two competing interests involved - protection of asylum seekers and ensuring public health as a legitimate reason for restricting certain asylum seekers' rights. The final part of the paper analyses the prospects of the future EU asylum system, as announced by the New Pact on Migration and Asylum in September 2020, to adapt to the exigencies of both the current Covid-19 crisis and pandemics that are yet to come. With an exclusive focus on referral to Covid-19 and provisions relevant for the current and future pandemics, the author criticizes several solutions included in the instruments that make up the Pact. It is concluded that the Pact failed to offer solutions for problems experienced during the Covid-19 pandemic and that, under the pretext of public health, it prioritizes the interests of Member States over the interests of applicants for international protection.","Cuckovic, B.",Eu 2021 - the Future of the Eu in and after the Pandemic,505,8

We found a significant positive correlation between general PSI and depression as well as severity of illness. General PSI differed significantly depending on social contact. Neither general PSI nor psychopathology changed significantly between T1 and T2. At T1, patients' psychosocial support systems were reduced as compared to six months before. Patients reported an increase in psychosocial support between T1 and T2 and high demand for additional support (sports, arts/occupational therapy, physiotherapy, psychotherapy).

Removal of these cytokines by therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) prior to end-organ damage may improve clinical outcomes. This manuscript is intended to serve as a preliminary guidance document for application of TPE in patients with severe COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The available literature pertaining to the role of TPE for treatment of COVID-19 patients was reviewed to guide optimal management. It included indication, contraindication, optimal timing of initiation and termination of TPE, vascular access and anticoagulants, numbers and mode of procedures, outcome measures and adverse events. RESULTS: Out of a total of 78 articles, only 65 were directly related to the topic. From these 65, only 32 were acceptable as primary source, while 33 were used as supporting references. TPE in critically ill COVID-19 patients may be classified under ASFA category III grade 2B. The early initiation of TPE for 1-1·5 patient's plasma volume with fresh frozen plasma, or 4-5% albumin or COVID-19 convalescent plasma as replacement fluids before multiorgan failure, has better chances of recovery. The number of procedures can vary from three to nine depending on patient response. CONCLUSION: TPE in COVID-19 patients may help by removing toxic cytokines, viral particles and/or by correcting coagulopathy or restoring endothelial membrane. Severity score (SOFA & APACHE II) and cytokine levels (IL-6, C-reactive protein) can be used to execute TPE therapy and to monitor response in COVID-19 patients.","Patidar, Gopal K; Land, Kevin J; Vrielink, Hans; Rahimi-Levene, Naomi; Dann, Eldad J; Al-Humaidan, Hind; Spitalnik, Steven L; Dhiman, Yashaswi; So-Osman, Cynthia; Hindawi, Salwa I",Vox sang,505,13

A fellowship in physician wellness provides structured opportunity for the development of expertise in the science and administration of physician wellness through a tailored curriculum and academic scholarship. Background Currently, limited opportunities exist to pursue formal wellness training in graduate medical education. This lack of specific training may make the path to expertise and leadership in physician wellness difficult. Objective Our objective was to design and implement a physician wellness fellowship in a Department of Emergency Medicine. Completion of this fellowship, with ongoing professional development, will give physicians the skills to fill various leadership roles within the house of medicine, such as chief wellness officer, department, organization, or national wellness leader, or wellness consultant. Development Process The fellowship curriculum was developed according to Kern?s six-step approach with expert consultation. The Stanford WellMD?Model of Professional?Fulfillment was used as a framework to define the core content. The curriculum has five principal components developed utilizing competency-based education in medicine: dissemination of knowledge (teaching), clinical, educational foundation, implementation (administrative), and critical investigation (research). Implementation Phase The physician wellness fellowship was implemented for the academic year 2019-2020. The fellow completed all the required fellowship activities. In addition, the fellow completed the American College of Emergency Physician?s teaching fellowship program. The fellowship is budget neutral as the fellow?s halftime clinical revenue is sufficient to cover the fellow?s salary and education, and support for fellowship direction. Reflective Discussion Outcomes of this novel program will be measured over time. Although the format of this fellowship is designed for Emergency Medicine, the skills and content are relevant to and may be adopted in other medical specialties at other institutions.","Singh, Jessica Poffenberger Cori Smith-Coggins Rebecca",AEM Education and Training,505,29

This analysis also reveals that humans infected with SARS-CoV-2 have infected mink populations in the Netherlands, Denmark, United States, and Canada. In these animals, a small set of mutations in the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), often occurring in specific combinations, has transferred back into humans. The viral genomic mutations in minks observed in the Netherlands and Denmark show the potential for new mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD to be introduced into humans by zoonotic transfer.

Contextually, the corresponding multi-faceted chain of healthcare events is likely to be severely disturbed or even temporarily broken under the force majeure conditions such as global pandemics. Consequently, the chronic liver disease is highly representative for the management of any severe chronic disorder under lasting pandemics with unprecedented numbers of acutely diseased persons who, together with the chronically sick patient cohorts, have to be treated using the given capacity of healthcare systems with their limited resources. Current study aimed at exploring potentially negative impacts of the SARS CoV-2 outbreak on the quality of the advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) management considering two well-classified parameters, namely, (1) the continuity of the patient registrations and (2) the level of mortality rates, comparing pre-COVID-19 statistics with these under the current pandemic in Slovak Republic. Altogether 1091 registrations to cirrhosis registry (with 60.8% versus 39.2% males to females ratio) were included with a median age of 57 years for patients under consideration. Already within the very first 3 months of the pandemic outbreak in Slovakia (lockdown declared from March 16, 2020, until May 20, 2020), the continuity of the patient registrations has been broken followed by significantly increased ACLD-related death rates. During this period of time, the total number of new registrations decreased by about 60% (15 registrations in 2020 versus 38 in 2018 and 38 in 2019). Corresponding mortality increased by about 52% (23 deaths in 2020 versus 10 in 2018 and 12 in 2019). Based on these results and in line with the framework of 3PM guidelines, the pandemic priority pathways (PPP) are strongly recommended for maintaining tertiary care uninterrupted. For the evidence-based implementation of PPP, creation of predictive algorithms and individualized care strategy tailored to the patient is essential. Resulting classification of measures is summarized as follows:The Green PPP Line is reserved for prioritized (urgent and comprehensive) treatment of patients at highest risk to die from ACLD (tertiary care) as compared to the risk from possible COVID-19 infection.The Orange PPP Line considers patients at middle risk of adverse outcomes from ACLD with re-addressing them to the secondary care. As further deterioration of ACLD is still probable, pro-active management is ascertained with tertiary center serving as the 24/7 telemedicine consultation hub for a secondary facility (on a physician-physician level).The Red PPP Line is related to the patients at low risk to die from ACLD, re-addressing them to the primary care. Since patients with stable chronic liver diseases without advanced fibrosis are at trivial inherent risk, they should be kept out of the healthcare setting as far as possible by the telemedical (patient-nurse or patient- physician) measurements. The assigned priority has to be monitored and re-evaluated individually-in intervals based on the baseline prognostic score such as MELD. The approach is conform with principles of predictive, preventive and personalized medicine (PPPM / 3PM) and demonstrates a potential of great clinical utility for an optimal management of any severe chronic disorder (cardiovascular, neurological and cancer) under lasting pandemics.","Skladany, Lubomir; Koller, Tomas; Adamcova Selcanova, Svetlana; Vnencakova, Janka; Jancekova, Daniela; Durajova, Viktoria; Laffers, Lukas; Svac, Juraj; Janickova, Katarina; Palkovic, Michal; Kohout, Pavel; Golubnitschaja, Olga",EPMA J,505,29

Since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, infection and mortality rates have been rising steadily worldwide. The lack of a vaccine, as well as preventive and therapeutic strategies, emphasize the need to develop new strategies to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission and pathogenesis. Since mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2 share a common genus, lessons learnt from MHV and SARS-CoV could offer mechanistic insights into SARS-CoV-2. This review provides a comprehensive review of MHV in mice and SARS-CoV-2 in humans, thereby highlighting further translational avenues in the development of innovative strategies in controlling the detrimental course of SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, we have focused on various aspects, including host species, organotropism, transmission, clinical disease, pathogenesis, control and therapy, MHV as a model for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 as well as mouse models for infection with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. While MHV in mice and SARS-CoV-2 in humans share various similarities, there are also differences that need to be addressed when studying murine models. Translational approaches, such as humanized mouse models are pivotal in studying the clinical course and pathology observed in COVID-19 patients. Lessons from prior murine studies on coronavirus, coupled with novel murine models could offer new promising avenues for treatment of COVID-19.","Körner, Robert W; Majjouti, Mohamed; Alcazar, Miguel A Alejandre; Mahabir, Esther",Viruses,505,29

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore the role of internet hospitals during the prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. METHODS: Online epidemic-related consultations from multicenter internet hospitals in China during the COVID-19 epidemic were collected. The counselees were described and classified into seven type groups. Symptoms were recorded and compared with reported patients with COVID-19. Hypochondriacal suspicion and offline visit motivation were detected within each counselees' group to evaluate the social panic of the epidemic along with the consequent medical-seeking behaviors. The counselees' motivation and the doctors' recommendation for an offline visit were compared. Risk factors affecting the counselees' tendency of hypochondriacal suspicion and offline visit motivation were explored by logistic regression models. The epidemic prevention and control measures based on internet hospitals were listed, and the corresponding effects were discussed. RESULTS: A total of 4913 consultations were enrolled for analysis with the median age of the counselees at 28 years (IQR 22-33 years). There were 104 (2.12%) healthy counselees, 147 (2.99%) hypochondriacal counselees, 34 (0.69%) exposed counselees, 853 (17.36%) mildly suspicious counselees, 42 (0.85%) moderately suspicious counselees, 3550 (72.26%) highly suspicious counselees, and 183 (3.72%) severely suspicious counselees. A total of 94.20% (n=4628) of counselees had epidemic-related symptoms with a distribution similar to those of COVID-19. The hypochondriacal suspicion (n=2167, 44.11%) was common. The counselees' motivation and the doctors' recommendation for offline visits were inconsistent (P<.001) with a Cohen kappa score of 0.039, indicating improper medical-seeking behaviors. Adult counselees (odds ratio [OR]=1.816, P<.001) with epidemiological exposure (OR 7.568, P<.001), shortness of breath (OR 1.440, P=.001), diarrhea (OR 1.272, P=.04), and unrelated symptoms (OR 1.509, P<.001) were more likely to have hypochondriacal suspicion. Counselees with severe illnesses (OR 2.303, P<.001), fever (OR 1.660, P<.001), epidemiological exposure history (OR 1.440, P=.01), and hypochondriacal suspicion (OR 4.826, P<.001) were more likely to attempt an offline visit. Reattending counselees (OR 0.545, P=.002) were less motivated to go to the offline clinic. CONCLUSIONS: Internet hospitals can serve different types of epidemic counselees, offer essential medical supports to the public during the COVID-19 outbreak, reduce the social panic, promote social distancing, enhance the public's ability of self-protection, correct improper medical-seeking behaviors, reduce the chance of nosocomial cross-infection, and facilitate epidemiological screening, thus, playing an important role on preventing and controlling COVID-19.","Gong, Kai; Xu, Zhong; Cai, Zhefeng; Chen, Yuxiu; Wang, Zhanxiang",J Med Internet Res,505,16

OBJECTIVES: To study the risk of COVID-19 infection in the presence of preexisting CV diseases and to describe new CV manifestations during COVID-19. METHODS: A ""scoping review"" was carried out via PubMed, to synthesize the results of research currently published on this subject. RESULTS: Patients with cardiovascular disease were at greater risk of developing COVID-19, especially in its severe form. These patients were five to ten times more at risk of death. Cardiac manifestations, de novo, were dominated by acute myocardial damage, defined by a significant elevation of cardiac troponins. These occurred in 7 to 17% of hospitalized patients. The presence of a new heart lesion in patients with COVID-19 was consistently associated with a poor prognosis. CONCLUSION: Given the enormous cardiovascular challenge posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the prognostic impact of heart damage, additional research at a high level of evidence will be necessary.","Yahia, Faten; Zakhama, Lilia; Ben Abdelaziz, Ahmed",Tunis Med,505,20

In recent years, rumors on social networks has caused grave problems and considerable damages. We attempted to create a method to verify information from numerous social media messages. We propose a general architecture that integrates machine learning and open data with a Chatbot and is based cloud computing (MLODCCC), which can assist users in evaluating information authenticity on social platforms. The proposed MLODCCC architecture consists of six integrated modules: cloud computing, machine learning, data preparation, open data, chatbot, and intelligent social application modules. Food safety has garnered worldwide attention. Consequently, we used the proposed MLODCCC architecture to develop a Food Safety Information Platform (FSIP) that provides a friendly hyperlink and chatbot interface on Facebook to identify credible food safety information. The performance and accuracy of three binary classification algorithms, namely the decision tree, logistic regression, and support vector machine algorithms, operating in different cloud computing environments were compared.

Methods In this cohort study, COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital in Wuhan between January 15 and April 1, 2020, were enrolled. Patients were categorized into PLWH and HIV-naive group. All patients were followed up regularly (every fifteen days) until November 30, 2020, and the immune response towards SARS-CoV-2 was observed. Results Totally, 18 PLWH and 185 HIV-naive individuals with COVID-19 were enrolled. The positive conversion rates of IgG were 56% in PLWH and 88% in HIV-naive patients respectively, and the peak was on the 45th day after COVID-19 onset. However, the positive rate of IgG dropped to 12% in PLWH and 33% among HIV-naive individuals by the end of the study. The positive conversion rate of IgG among asymptomatic carriers is significantly lower than that among moderate patients (AOR = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.05-0.65) and PLWH had a lower IgG seroconversion rate compared to the HIV-naive group (AOR = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.05-0.90). Patients with lower lymphocyte counts at onset had a higher positive conversion rate (AOR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.09-0.90) and longer duration for IgG (AHR = 4.01, 95% CI: 1.78-9.02). Conclusions The positive conversion rate of IgG for SARS-CoV-2 was relatively lower and quickly lost in PLWH, which meant PLWH was in a disadvantaged situation when affected with COVID-19.","Liu, Y.; Xiao, Y.; Wu, S.; Marly, G.; Ming, F.; Wang, X.; Wu, M.; Feng, L.; Tang, W.; Liang, K.",,505,16

The persistence and clearance of viral RNA from different specimens of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remain unclear. This study analyzed the clearance time and factors influencing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA in different samples from patients with COVID-19, providing further evidence to improve the management of patients during convalescence. METHODS: The clinical data and laboratory test results of convalescent patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were collected retrospectively. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for patients' oropharyngeal swab, stool, urine, and serum samples were collected and analyzed. Convalescent patients refer to recovered non-febrile patients without respiratory symptoms who had two successive (minimum 24 h sampling interval) negative RT-PCR results for viral RNA from oropharyngeal swabs. The effects of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T lymphocytes, inflammatory indicators, and glucocorticoid treatment on viral nucleic acid clearance were analyzed. RESULTS: In the 292 confirmed cases, 66 patients recovered after treatment and were included in our study. In total, 28 (42.4%) women and 38 men (57.6%) with a median age of 44.0 (34.0-62.0) years were analyzed. After in-hospital treatment, patients' inflammatory indicators decreased with improved clinical condition. The median time from the onset of symptoms to first negative RT-PCR results for oropharyngeal swabs in convalescent patients was 9.5 (6.0-11.0) days. By February 10, 2020, 11 convalescent patients (16.7%) still tested positive for viral RNA from stool specimens and the other 55 patients' stool specimens were negative for 2019-nCoV following a median duration of 11.0 (9.0-16.0) days after symptom onset. Among these 55 patients, 43 had a longer duration until stool specimens were negative for viral RNA than for throat swabs, with a median delay of 2.0 (1.0-4.0) days. Results for only four (6.9%) urine samples were positive for viral nucleic acid out of 58 cases; viral RNA was still present in three patients' urine specimens after throat swabs were negative. Using a multiple linear regression model (Fâ=â2.669, Pâ=â0.044, and adjusted Râ=â0.122), the analysis showed that the CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patients' stools (tâ=â-2.699, Pâ=â0.010). The duration of viral RNA detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs. 8.0 days, respectively; tâ=â2.550, Pâ=â0.013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs. 11 days, respectively; tâ=â4.631, Pâ<â0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those with negative results (Pâ>â0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In brief, as the clearance of viral RNA in patients' stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to identify viral RNA in feces during convalescence. Because of the delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for mild disease. The duration of RNA detection may relate to host cell immunity.","Ling, Yun; Xu, Shui-Bao; Lin, Yi-Xiao; Tian, Di; Zhu, Zhao-Qin; Dai, Fa-Hui; Wu, Fan; Song, Zhi-Gang; Huang, Wei; Chen, Jun; Hu, Bi-Jie; Wang, Sheng; Mao, En-Qiang; Zhu, Lei; Zhang, Wen-Hong; Lu, Hong-Zhou",Chin Med J (Engl),505,20

The determination of their phase diagrams proved challenging, and indeed, those of hard disks, hard regular polygons, and inverse power-law potentials have only recently been clarified. In this context, the role of attractive forces is currently speculative, despite their prevalence at both the molecular and colloidal scale. Here, we demonstrate, via numerical simulations, that attraction promotes a discontinuous melting scenario with no hexatic phase. At high-temperature, Lennard-Jones particles and attractive polygons follow the shape-dominated melting scenario observed in hard disks and hard polygons, respectively. Conversely, all systems melt via a first-order transition with no hexatic phase at low temperature, where attractive forces dominate. The intermediate temperature melting scenario is shape dependent. Our results suggest that, in colloidal experiments, the tunability of the strength of the attractive forces allows for the observation of different melting scenarios in the same system.","Li, Yan-Wei; Ciamarra, Massimo Pica",Phys Rev Lett,505,15

In recent times, there has been an emphasis on safe school re-opening. This concept is likely to differ between developed and developing country settings. There are however no published studies on barriers hindering safe school re-opening within developing country contexts. This study evaluates aspects of the school health program (SHP) in some selected Nigerian schools that might relate to the pandemic control during school re-opening. METHODS: In 2017, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of the SHP of 146 registered primary schools in Gwagwalada Area Council in Abuja, Nigeria. These schools provided services to about 54,562 students. We used direct observational methods and interviewer-administered questionnaires to assess the SHP of each school. We compare SHP characteristics that might relate to COVID-19 control in schools across government-owned (public) and privately-owned (private) schools using a pre-defined framework. RESULTS: Public school to pupil ratios was more than six times that of private schools. Only 6.9% of all surveyed schools employed qualified health personnel. Although 8 in every 10 schools conducted health talks for communicable disease control, the use of temporary isolation and school-based immunization were low at 1.4 and 2.7% respectively. Pipe-borne water access was present in 4 of 10 schools, with public schools having more limited access than private schools (p = 0.009). Similarly, less proportion of public schools had access to soap for handwashing (p < 0.001). Adequate classroom ventilation was present in 63% of surveyed schools, with private schools having more limited ventilation (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Overcrowding and infrastructural deficits within developing country contexts represent barriers to safe school re-opening during the COVID-19 pandemic. In these settings, there needs to be tailored and innovative strategies which consider local practical realities when designing the COVID-19 control programs during school re-opening.","Sanni, Usman A; Offiong, Uduak M; Anigilaje, Emmanuel A; Airede, Kareem I; Imam, Abdulazeez",BMC Public Health,505,24

There are no population-based studies from the United States (U.S.) analyzing this association. The aim of the study is to analyze the trends, predictors of mortality, and outcomes of VTE in AML patients. Methods We analyzed the publicly available Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) for years 2010-2014. Hospitalizations due to AML were identified by previously validated International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes as the primary diagnosis. VTE was identified by ICD-9-CM codes as secondary diagnosis. Hospitalizations with age less than 18 years of age were excluded. The trends and outcomes were determined using Chi-squared (&#967;2) test and multivariate regression models. Results From 2010 to 2014, there were 313,282 hospitalizations with a primary diagnosis of AML and 1,633 hospitalizations (0.1%) had VTE as a concurrent diagnosis. There was a significant increase in the proportion of AML hospitalizations with VTE from 0.47% in 2010 to 0.56% in 2014 (P = 0.014). Multivariable regression analysis showed that the odds of in-hospital mortality were not higher in AML hospitalizations with VTE (odds ratio [OR] 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.81 - 1.52; P = 0.5) than those without VTE. Age group above 84 years carried the highest risk of mortality (OR 3.20; 95% CI 2.77 - 3.70; P <0.0001) in AML-VTE patients. Black (OR 1.23; 95% CI 1.13 - 1.35; P <0.0001) and uninsured patients (OR 1.50; 95% CI 1.31 - 1.73; P <0.0001) were at significantly higher odds of in-hospital mortality amongst the AML-VTE hospitalizations. Conclusion The proportion of AML hospitalizations with VTE continues to rise in the U.S. After adjusting for confounders, increasing age, Black race, and lack of insurance were found to have higher risk of in-hospital mortality in the AML-VTE cohort. The odds of in-hospital mortality in AML hospitalizations with VTE are not higher than those without VTE.","Khadka, Sushmita; Solanki, Dhanshree; Singh, Jagmeet; Kichloo, Asim; Patel, Neil R; Sharma, Purnima; Chugh, Savneek; Solanki, Shantanu",Postgrad. med,505,26

Since COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, several drug regimens have rapidly undergone clinical trials for the management of COVID-19. However, one of the major issues is drug-induced organ injury, which is a prominent clinical challenge. Unfortunately, most drugs used against COVID-19 are associated with adverse effects in different organs, such as the kidney, heart, and liver. These side effects are dangerous and, in some cases, they can be lethal. More importantly, organ injury is also a clinical manifestation of COVID-19 infection. These adverse reactions are increasingly recognized as outcomes of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, the differential diagnosis of drug-induced adverse effects from COVID-19-induced organ injury is a clinical complication. This review highlights the importance of drug-induced organ injury, its known mechanisms, and the potential therapeutic strategies in COVID-19 pharmacotherapy.

Astragali Radix (AR) and Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma (AMR) are widely used as traditional tonic and promising edible immunomodulatory herbal medicine, but the systemic mechanism is not well understood. Therefore, a strategy based on network pharmacology and molecular docking was designed to explore the systemic mechanism of AR-AMR acting on pneumonia. After a series of bioinformatics assays, seven kernel targets were obtained, including TNF, IL6, IFNG, IL1B, IL10, IL4, and TLR9. And seven key compounds were identified as the synergy components of AR-AMR acting on pneumonia, the four key compounds belonging to AR were (3R)-3-(2-hydroxy-3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-7-chromanol, formononetin, quercetin, and kaempferol, the three key compounds belonging to AMR were atractylone, 14-acetyl-12-senecioyl-2E, 8E, 10E-atractylentriol, and &#945;-Amyrin. The crucial pathways were mainly related to three modules, including immune diseases, infectious disease, and organismal systems. Collectively, these observations strongly suggest that the molecular mechanisms of AR-AMR regulating pneumonia were closely related to the correlation between inflammation and immune response. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Astragali radix and Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma can be used as ""medicine-food homology"" for dietary supplement. AR and AMR are widely used as a traditional tonic and promising edible immunomodulatory herbal medicine.

Traditionally, telemedicine has been used for acute events (e.g., stroke, used to relay essential information to the emergency department) and chronic disease management (e.g., diabetes and chronic kidney disease management). Though the utilization of telemedicine in gastroenterology and hepatology has been modest at best, especially for inflammatory bowel diseases and chronic liver disease management, since the onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, utilization of telemedicine in gastroenterology increased by 4000% in the first two weeks, equivalent to the last six years of growth before the pandemic. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) relaxed rules for the use of telemedicine with easing restrictions on reimbursements, location, licensing requirements (across state lines), and the need for a prior provider-patient relationship. These changes increased the use of telemedicine in inpatient and outpatient settings for gastroenterology-related referrals. The use of inpatient telephonic or video consults helps provide timely care during the pandemic while conserving personal protective equipment and decreasing provider and patient exposure. Nevertheless, telehealth use comes at the cost of no direct patient contact and lesser reimbursements. The appropriate use of technology and equipment, training of healthcare providers, use of platforms that can be integrated into the electronic health record while protecting the privacy and the flow of information are essential components of telemedicine. Furthermore, encouraging patients to seek medical care remotely with the proper equipment and improving digital literacy without the need for physical examinations is a challenge, further compounded in elderly or hard-of-hearing patients and in patients who are more comfortable with in-person visits. The authors will systematically review and discuss how telemedicine can be integrated into the practice of gastroenterology and hepatology, with emphasis placed on discussing barriers to success and the ways they can be mitigated.","Perisetti, Abhilash; Goyal, Hemant",Dig Dis Sci,505,16

METHODS: Adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were recruited. The primary endpoint was maximum COVID-19 severity within 30 days of index ED visit. RESULTS: A total of 52 COVID-19 patients were enrolled. IL-10 and IL-10/lymphocyte count were significantly higher in patients with severe disease (p<0.05), as well as in those who developed severe acute kidney injury (AKI) and new positive bacterial cultures (all p&#8804;0.01). In multivariable analysis, a one-unit increase in IL-10 and IL-10/lymphocyte count were associated with 42% (p=0.031) and 32% (p=0.013) increased odds, respectively, of severe COVID-19. When standardized to a one-unit standard deviations scale, an increase in the IL-10 was a stronger predictor of maximum 30-day severity and severe AKI than increases in IL-6 or IL-8. CONCLUSIONS: The hyperinflammatory response to COVID-19 is accompanied by a simultaneous anti-inflammatory response, which is associated with poor outcomes and may increase the risk of new positive bacterial cultures. IL-10 and IL-10/lymphocyte count at ED presentation were independent predictors of COVID-19 severity. Moreover, elevated IL-10 was more strongly associated with outcomes than pro-inflammatory IL-6 or IL-8. The anti-inflammatory response in COVID-19 requires further investigation to enable more precise immunomodulatory therapy against SARS-CoV-2.","Henry, Brandon Michael; Benoit, Stefanie W; Vikse, Jens; Berger, Brandon A; Pulvino, Christina; Hoehn, Jonathan; Rose, James; Santos de Oliveira, Maria Helena; Lippi, Giuseppe; Benoit, Justin L",Clin Chem Lab Med,505,24

METHODS: Retrospective audit of respiratory viruses at a tertiary paediatric hospital in Melbourne from January 2015 up to week 47, 2020 in children under 18 years of age. The proportion of positive cases in weeks 1-47 in 2015-2019 (period 1) were compared to weeks 1-47, 2020 (period 2), and reviewed in the context of public health restrictions in Victoria. RESULTS: An annual average of 4636 tests were performed in period 1 compared to 3659 tests in period 2. Proportions of positive influenza A virus, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human parainfluenza virus were significantly reduced in period 2 compared to period 1: 77.3, 89.4, 68.6 and 66.9% reductions, respectively (all P < 0.001). From week 12-47, 2020, 28 893 SARS-CoV-2 tests were performed with a 0.64% positivity rate. Influenza viruses were not detected after week 17, RSV was not detected after week 35. CONCLUSIONS: Strict public health measures and border closures were successful in eliminating community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Melbourne. This was associated with a significant reduction in other respiratory virus infections in children. Identifying sustainable and effective ongoing public health interventions to reduce transmission of RSV and influenza could result in reduced morbidity and mortality in children and requires further research.","Abo, Yara-Natalie; Clifford, Vanessa; Lee, Lai-Yang; Costa, Anna-Maria; Crawford, Nigel; Wurzel, Danielle; Daley, Andrew J",J. paediatr. child health,505,13

This has led to widespread testing that interrupted the supply chain for testing materials around the world. A prospective study was conducted to compare inexpensive and easily sourced 3-dimensionally (3D)-printed polylactic acid and polyester nasopharyngeal swabs to commercially manufactured swabs for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). During the study period, 287 laboratory-confirmed hospitalized COVID-19 patients, at multiple stages of their illness, were enrolled. The median age for the study population was 47.6 years (interquartile range [IQR], 34.4 to 56.6 years), and two-thirds (67.6%) of the subjects were male. The median duration of hospitalization, at the time of sampling, was 13 days (IQR, 10 to 16 days). Overall concordance between the prototype and control swabs was 80.8% (Cohen's kappa coefficient, 0.61). Most discrepant results were due to prototype-positive control-negative results. When considering all positive results to be true positives, the prototype swab had a higher sensitivity (90.6% versus 80.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 85.7% to 94.0% and 74.7% to 85.7%, respectively; P < 0.015). The cost to produce the prototype swab was estimated to be $0.05 per swab. Polylactic acid 3D-printed polyester-tipped swabs were shown to be effective for nasopharyngeal sample collection. We believe that this design can easily be adopted in countries where commercial swabs are not readily available and can play a vital role in public health efforts for disease control in low-income countries.","Alghounaim, Mohammad; Almazeedi, Sulaiman; Al Youha, Sarah; Papenburg, Jesse; Alowaish, Osama; AbdulHussain, Ghadeer; Al-Shemali, Rawan; Albuloushi, Ahmad; Alzabin, Saud; Al-Wogayan, Khaled; Al-Mutawa, Yousef; Al-Sabah, Salman",J. clin. microbiol,505,15

A better understanding of the pathophysiology associated with COVID-19 is crucial to improve treatment modalities and to develop effective prevention strategies. Transcriptomic and proteomic data on the host response against SARS-CoV-2 still have anecdotic character; currently available data from other coronavirus infections are therefore a key source of information. METHODS: We investigated selected molecular aspects of three human coronavirus (HCoV) infections, namely SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E, through a network based-approach. A functional analysis of HCoV-host interactome was carried out in order to provide a theoretic host-pathogen interaction model for HCoV infections and in order to translate the results in prediction for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. The 3D model of S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was compared to the structure of the corresponding SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV S-glycoprotein. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E and the host interactome were inferred through published protein-protein interactions (PPI) as well as gene co-expression, triggered by HCoV S-glycoprotein in host cells. RESULTS: Although the amino acid sequences of the S-glycoprotein were found to be different between the various HCoV, the structures showed high similarity, but the best 3D structural overlap shared by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, consistent with the shared ACE2 predicted receptor. The host interactome, linked to the S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, mainly highlighted innate immunity pathway components, such as Toll Like receptors, cytokines and chemokines. CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we developed a network-based model with the aim to define molecular aspects of pathogenic phenotypes in HCoV infections. The resulting pattern may facilitate the process of structure-guided pharmaceutical and diagnostic research with the prospect to identify potential new biological targets.","Messina, Francesco; Giombini, Emanuela; Agrati, Chiara; Vairo, Francesco; Ascoli Bartoli, Tommaso; Al Moghazi, Samir; Piacentini, Mauro; Locatelli, Franco; Kobinger, Gary; Maeurer, Markus; Zumla, Alimuddin; Capobianchi, Maria R; Lauria, Francesco Nicola; Ippolito, Giuseppe",J Transl Med,505,1

Yet, because not all regions are affected equally, this research aims to understand whether the relative growth rate of the initial outbreak in early 2020 varied significantly between the US states and counties. STUDY DESIGN: Based on publicly available case data from across the USA, the initial outbreak is statistically modeled as an exponential curve. METHODS: Regional differences are visually compared using geo maps and spaghetti lines. In addition, they are statistically analyzed as an unconditional model (one-way random effects analysis of variance estimated with HLM 7.03); the bias between state- and county-level models is evidenced with distribution tests and Bland-Altman plots (using SPSS 26). RESULTS: At the state level, the outbreak rate follows a normal distribution with an average relative growth rate of 0.197 (doubling time 3.518 days). But there is a low degree of reliability between state-wide and county-specific data reported (Intraclass correlation coefficient ICC = 0.169, P < 0.001), with a bias of 0.070 (standard deviation 0.062) as shown with a Bland-Altman plot. Hence, there is a significant variation in the outbreak between the US states and counties.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty bovine teeth cut to a length of 18 mm (crown 8 mm, root 10 mm) were randomly assigned to 10 groups (n = 8), receiving orthograde apical plug treatment (APT). Apical plugs were 4 mm in length and made of ProRoot MTA (Dentsply), Medcem MTA (Medcem), TotalFill BC RRM Fast Set Putty (Brasseler), or Medcem Medical Portland Cement (Medcem) plus bismuth oxide (Bi2O3) with and without bovine blood. Further, orthograde (with or without preoperative adhesive coronal dentin sealing) and retrograde APT were compared. Teeth were obturated with gutta-percha and sealer, sealed with composite and stored in distilled water. Tooth color was measured on apical plug, gutta-percha/sealer, and crown surface before treatment versus 24 h, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after treatment by spectrophotometry. Color difference (&#916;E) values were calculated and analyzed by Shapiro-Wilk test, ANOVA with post hoc tests, Friedman test, t test, and post hoc tests with Bonferroni correction (&#945; = .05). RESULTS: Tooth discoloration occurred in all groups with no significant differences between HCSCs (p > .05). After 24 months, color changes were prominent on roots but insignificant on crowns. Blood contamination induced a significantly decreased luminescence (p < .05). Blood had a stronger impact on tooth color than Bi2O3. No relevant effects of retrograde placement (p > .05) or preoperative dentin sealing (p > .05) were detected.

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study conducted between June to August of 2020, we invited HCWs through social channels to complete a questionnaire. The questionnaire inquired about demographics, factors related to burnout, and used the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory scale to indicate burnout. A total of 646 HCWs participated. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of participants was 34.1 (9.5) years. Sixty-one percent were female. The prevalence of burnout among HCWs was 75%. Significant factors associated with burnout were age, job title, years of experience, increased working hours during the pandemic, average hours of sleep per day, exposure to patients with COVID-19, number of times tested for COVID-19, and perception of being pushed to deal with COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Health care workers as frontline workers, face great challenges during this pandemic, because of the nature of their work.

METHODS: We reviewed a total of 307 VFs performed with a face mask (FPP2/KN95 or surgical masks) and compared them with prior VFs, performed before the pandemic. VFs with suspected pseudoprogression due to mask artefacts (VF test 1) were repeated with a surgical mask and an adhesive tape on its superior border (VF test 2) to distinguish from true VF loss. Several parameters including reliability indices, test duration, VF index (VFI), mean defect (MD) and pattern deviation probability plots were compared among last pre-COVID VFs, VF tests 1 and VF tests 2, using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: We identified 18 VFs with suspected progression artefact due to masks (5.8%). In all of them, the median VFI and MD significantly improved after fitting the superior border of the mask, showing no significant differences with pre-COVID tests. The median fixation losses were significantly higher when wearing the unfitted mask (13% vs 6%,p=0.047). The inferior hemifield was the most affected, either as a new scotoma or as an enlargement of a prior defect. CONCLUSION: Unfitted masks can simulate VF progression in around 6% of cases, mainly in the inferior hemifield, and increase significantly the rate of fixation losses. A similar rate of artefacts was observed using FPP2/KN95 or surgical masks. The use of a surgical mask with an adhesive tape covering the superior border may reduce mask-related artefacts, although concomitant progression cannot be ruled out in all cases.","Gómez Mariscal, Marta; Muñoz-Negrete, Francisco José; Muñoz-Ramón, Pablo Vicente; Aguado Casanova, Victor; Jaumandreu, Laia; Rebolleda, Gema",Br. j. ophthalmol,505,22

However, data about factors associated with vaccine hesitancy and the impact of mental health and/or substance use (MHSU) issues on vaccine uptake are currently not available. The goal of this study was to explore factors, particularly MHSU factors, that impact COVID-19 vaccination intentions in Ontario, Canada. MethodsA community-based cross-sectional survey with recruitment based on age, gender, and geographical location (to ensure a representative population of Ontario), was conducted in February 2021. Multinomial logistic regression was used to test the relationship between COVID-19 vaccination status and plans and sociodemographic background, social support, anxiety about contracting COVID-19, and MHSU concerns. ResultsOf the total sample of 2528 respondents, 1932 (76.4%) were vaccine ready, 381 (15.1%) were hesitant, and 181 (7.1%) were resistant. Significant independent predictors of vaccine hesitancy compared with vaccine readiness included younger age (OR=2.11, 95%CI=1.62-2.74), female gender (OR=1.36, 95%CI=1.06-1.74), Black ethnicity (OR=2.11, 95%CI=1.19-3.75), lower education (OR=1.69, 95%CI=1.30-2.20), lower SES status (OR=.88, 95%CI=.84-.93), lower anxiety about self or someone close contracting COVID-19 (OR=2.06, 95%CI=1.50-2.82), and lower depression score (OR=.90, 95%CI=.82-.98).

This is in silico comparison study of ten phenolic antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2, as well as isolation of the most active metabolite from natural sources. Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) were also then prepared using these metabolite as a reducing agent. All tested compounds showed predicted anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Hesperidin showed the highest docking score, this leads us to isolate it from the orange peels and we confirmed its structure by conventenional spectroscopic analysis. In addition, synthesis of hesperidin zinc oxide nanoparticles was characterized by UV, IR, XRD and TEM. In vitro antiviral activity of hesperidin and ZnO NPs was evaluated against hepatitis A virus as an example of RNA viruses. However, ZnO NPs and hesperidin showed antiviral activity against HAV but ZnO NPs showed higher activity than hesperidin. Thus, hesperidin and its mediated ZnO nanoparticles are willing antiviral agents and further studies against SARS-CoV-2 are required to be used as a potential treatment.","Attia, Gouda H; Moemen, Yasmine S; Youns, Mahmoud; Ibrahim, Ammar M; Abdou, Randa; El Raey, Mohamed A",Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces,505,26

METHODS: We performed a disproportionality analysis of the World Health Organization pharmacovigilance database between January 1, 2020, and June 10, 2020. The frequency of COVID-19 reports for all DMARD classes identified was compared with that for all other reports for all other drugs and quoted as the reporting odds ratio (ROR) (95% confidence interval [CI]). RESULTS: Among 980,446 individual case-safety reports voluntarily recorded in the database, 398 identified COVID-19 in DMARD-treated patients with IRDs. There were 177 (44.5%) patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 120 (30.1%) with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), 93 (23.4%) with psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and 8 (2.0%) with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Most of the cases of COVID-19 occurred in patients taking anti-TNF agents (84.2%), resulting in a significant disproportionality signal (ROR [95% CI]: 8.31 [7.48-9.23]) - particularly in patients with RA, AS or PsA. A significant inverse disproportionality was found for the anti-IL-6 agent tocilizumab (ROR [95% CI]: 0.12 [0.02-0.88]) and JAK inhibitors (ROR [95% CI]: 0.33 [0.19-0.58]) in patients with RA - suggesting that these two drug classes are safer in the context of RA. CONCLUSION: Our results are in line with the literature on a potentially better safety profile for anti-IL-6 agents and JAK inhibitors. The WHO pharmacovigilance data suggest that COVID-19 is significantly more frequent in patients with IRDs treated with TNF inhibitors.","Dernoncourt, Amandine; Schmidt, Jean; Duhaut, Pierre; Liabeuf, Sophie; Gras-Champel, Valérie; Masmoudi, Kamel; Bennis, Youssef; Batteux, Benjamin",Fundam. clin. pharmacol,505,0

In this study, a 3D inversion recovery-prepared ultrashort echo time cones (IR-UTE-Cones) sequence was used for both morphological and quantitative imaging of myelin on a clinical 3 T scanner. Myelin powder phantoms with different myelin concentrations were imaged with the 3D UTE-Cones sequence and it showed a strong correlation between concentrations and UTE-Cones signals, demonstrating the ability of the UTE-Cones sequence to directly image myelin in the brain. Quantitative myelin imaging with multi-echo IR-UTE-Cones sequences show similar T2 * values for a D2 O-exchanged myelin phantom (T2 * = 0.33 ± 0.04 ms), ex vivo brain specimens (T2 * = 0.20 ± 0.04 ms) and in vivo healthy volunteers (T2 * = 0.254 ± 0.023 ms), further confirming the feasibility of 3D IR-UTE-Cones sequences for direct myelin imaging in vivo. In ex vivo MS brain study, signal loss is observed in MS lesions, which was confirmed with histology. For the in vivo study, the lesions in MS patients also show myelin signal loss using the proposed direct myelin imaging method, demonstrating the clinical potential for MS diagnosis. Furthermore, the measured IR-UTE-Cones signal intensities show a significant difference between normal-appearing white matter in MS patients and normal white matter in volunteers, which cannot be found in clinical used T2 -FLAIR sequences. Thus, the proposed 3D IR-UTE-Cones sequence showed clinical potential for MS diagnosis with the capability of direct myelin detection of the whole brain.","Ma, Ya-Jun; Searleman, Adam C; Jang, Hyungseok; Fan, Shu-Juan; Wong, Jonathan; Xue, Yanping; Cai, Zhenyu; Chang, Eric Y; Corey-Bloom, Jody; Du, Jiang",NMR Biomed,505,32

The rarity of these case poses therapeutic dilemmas about their further management. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 61 year old gentleman who had covid19 infection 2 months back, presented with new onset myasthenia gravis and an anterior mediastinal mass. He was diagnosed as a case of anti acetyl choline receptor antibody positive thymomatous myasthenia gravis. The patient was posted for video assisted thoracoscopic excision of thymoma. The procedure was uneventful and patient was discharged with improvement in myasthenic symptoms. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of WHO Type A Spindle cell thymoma. DISCUSSION: SARS CoV19 infection is associated with an array of autoimmune disorders due to various proposed phenomenon including molecular mimicry and loss of immune tolerance. Post infectious thymomatous myasthenia gravis is extremely uncommon, and can be managed with open, minimally invasive or robotic approach. CONCLUSION: This is the first documented case of post covid19 infection thymomatous myasthenia gravis to the best of our knowledge, managed with minimally invasive thoracoscopic surgery.

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is the most important medical challenge in decades. Previous research mainly focused on the exploration of lung changes. However, with development of the disease and deepening research, more and more patients showed cardiovascular diseases, even in those without respiratory symptoms, and some researchers have found that underlying cardiovascular diseases increase the risk of infection. Although the related mechanism is not thoroughly studied, based on existing research, we speculate that the interaction between the virus and its receptor, inflammatory factors, various forms of the stress response, hypoxic environment, and drug administration could all induce the development of cardiac adverse events. Interventions to control these pathogenic factors may effectively reduce the occurrence of cardiovascular complications.

Therefore, we monitored the time course of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in raw sewage in the Frankfurt metropolitan area, the European financial center. To determine the SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in sewage, we continuously collected 24 h composite samples twice a week from two wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influents (Niederrad and Sindlingen) serving the Frankfurt metropolitan area and performed RT-qPCR analysis targeting three genes (N gene, S gene, and ORF1ab gene). In August, a resurgence in the SARS-CoV-2 RNA load was observed, reaching 3 × 1013 copies/day, which represented similar levels compared to April with approx. 2 × 1014 copies/day. This corresponds to a continuous increase again in COVID-19 cases in Frankfurt since August, with an average of 28.6 incidences, compared to 28.7 incidences in April. Different temporal dynamics were observed between different sampling points, indicating local dynamics in COVID-19 cases within the Frankfurt metropolitan area.

This study aimed to illustrate the epidemic COVID-19 growth pattern in Italy by considering the regional differences in disease diffusion during the first 3 mo of the epidemic. METHODS: Official COVID-19 data were obtained from the Italian Civil Protection Department of the Council of Ministers Presidency. The mortality and ICU admission rates per 100,000 inhabitants were calculated at the regional level and summarized by means of a Bayesian multilevel meta-analysis. Data were retrieved until April 21, 2020. RESULTS: The highest cumulative mortality rates per 100 000 inhabitants were observed in northern Italy, particularly in Lombardia (85.3; 95% credibility intervals [CI], 75.7-94.7). The difference in the mortality rates between northern and southern Italy increased over time, reaching a difference of 67.72 (95% CI, 66-67) cases on April 2, 2020.

Objective: To assess whether helmet noninvasive ventilation can increase the days free of respiratory support in patients with COVID-19 compared with high-flow nasal oxygen alone. Design, Setting, and Participants: Multicenter randomized clinical trial in 4 intensive care units (ICUs) in Italy between October and December 2020, end of follow-up February 11, 2021, including 109 patients with COVID-19 and moderate to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure (ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen &#8804;200). Interventions: Participants were randomly assigned to receive continuous treatment with helmet noninvasive ventilation (positive end-expiratory pressure, 10-12 cm H2O; pressure support, 10-12 cm H2O) for at least 48 hours eventually followed by high-flow nasal oxygen (n = 54) or high-flow oxygen alone (60 L/min) (n = 55). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the number of days free of respiratory support within 28 days after enrollment. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients who required endotracheal intubation within 28 days from study enrollment, the number of days free of invasive mechanical ventilation at day 28, the number of days free of invasive mechanical ventilation at day 60, in-ICU mortality, in-hospital mortality, 28-day mortality, 60-day mortality, ICU length of stay, and hospital length of stay. Results: Among 110 patients who were randomized, 109 (99%) completed the trial (median age, 65 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 55-70]; 21 women [19%]). The median days free of respiratory support within 28 days after randomization were 20 (IQR, 0-25) in the helmet group and 18 (IQR, 0-22) in the high-flow nasal oxygen group, a difference that was not statistically significant (mean difference, 2 days [95% CI, -2 to 6]; P = .26). Of 9 prespecified secondary outcomes reported, 7 showed no significant difference. The rate of endotracheal intubation was significantly lower in the helmet group than in the high-flow nasal oxygen group (30% vs 51%; difference, -21% [95% CI, -38% to -3%]; P = .03). The median number of days free of invasive mechanical ventilation within 28 days was significantly higher in the helmet group than in the high-flow nasal oxygen group (28 [IQR, 13-28] vs 25 [IQR 4-28]; mean difference, 3 days [95% CI, 0-7]; P = .04). The rate of in-hospital mortality was 24% in the helmet group and 25% in the high-flow nasal oxygen group (absolute difference, -1% [95% CI, -17% to 15%]; P > .99). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with COVID-19 and moderate to severe hypoxemia, treatment with helmet noninvasive ventilation, compared with high-flow nasal oxygen, resulted in no significant difference in the number of days free of respiratory support within 28 days. Further research is warranted to determine effects on other outcomes, including the need for endotracheal intubation.

Currently, our facility uses the pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) bronchodilator with Venturi mask modified spacer (VMMS) in patients visiting the Emergency Department (ED) for mild to moderate exacerbation of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We sought to assess the outcomes and acceptance of pMDI-VMMS in the outpatient ED of a tertiary hospital in Malaysia. METHODS: We analysed the total visits and discharge rates during periods of using the nebulizer and current pMDI-VMMS methods. The acceptance of pMDI-VMMS by patients and assistant medical officers (AMOs) were assessed by questionnaire. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We analysed 3184 ED visits and responses from 103 patients and 32 AMOs. The direct discharge rate was similar for both nebulizer (n = 2162, 92.5%) and pMDI-VMMS method (n = 768, 90.7%) (p-value = 0.120). Twenty-eight patients (27.2%) favoured the pMDI-VMMS over the nebulizer, whereas 36 patients (35.0%) had no preference for either method. Sixty-four patients (62.1%) felt that the current pMDI-VMMS method was better or at least as effective in relieving their symptoms as a nebulizer. The current method was favoured over the nebulizer by twenty-seven AMOs (84.4%). Twenty-eight (87.5%) AMOs suggested that the current method was more effective than the nebulizer. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: The bronchodilator delivered via pMDI-VMMS appeared to be comparable to nebulizer in treating mild to moderate asthma and COPD exacerbations in the outpatient ED. Most patients and AMOs accepted the use of pMDI-VMMS in the outpatient ED during the current COVID-19 pandemic. The Venturi mask modified spacer can be a cheap and effective alternative to the commercial spacer in a resource-limited situation.","Koh, Hock Peng; Shamsudin, Nurul Shaliza; Tan, Marilyn May Yeen; Mohd Pauzi, Zulsairi",J. clin. pharm. ther,505,32

Here we consider these bidirectional links between host social behaviours and parasite infection, both those that occur from ecological vs evolutionary processes. First, we review how social behaviours of individuals and groups influence ecological patterns of parasite transmission. We then discuss how parasite infection, in turn, can alter host social interactions by changing the behaviour of both infected and uninfected individuals. Together, these ecological feedbacks between social behaviour and parasite infection can result in important epidemiological consequences. Next, we consider the ways in which host social behaviours evolve in response to parasites, highlighting constraints that arise from the need for hosts to maintain benefits of sociality while minimizing fitness costs of parasites. Finally, we consider how host social behaviours shape the population genetic structure of parasites and the evolution of key parasite traits, such as virulence. Overall, these bidirectional relationships between host social behaviours and parasites are an important yet often underappreciated component of population-level disease dynamics and host-parasite coevolution.","Hawley, Dana M; Gibson, Amanda K; Townsend, Andrea K; Craft, Meggan E; Stephenson, Jessica F",Parasitology,505,10

Loss of BLM activity leads to Bloom syndrome, which is characterized by extraordinary cancer risk and small stature. Here, we have analyzed the composition of the BLM complex during unperturbed S-phase and identified a direct physical interaction with the Mcm6 subunit of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex. Using distinct binding sites, BLM interacts with the N-terminal domain of Mcm6 in G1 phase and switches to the C-terminal Cdt1-binding domain of Mcm6 in S-phase, with a third site playing a role for Mcm6 binding after DNA damage. Disruption of Mcm6-binding to BLM in S-phase leads to supra-normal DNA replication speed in unperturbed cells, and the helicase activity of BLM is required for this increased replication speed. Upon disruption of BLM/Mcm6 interaction, repair of replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks is delayed and cells become hypersensitive to DNA damage and replication stress. Our findings reveal that BLM not only plays a role in the response to DNA damage and replication stress, but that its physical interaction with Mcm6 is required in unperturbed cells, most notably in S-phase as a negative regulator of replication speed.","Shastri, Vivek M; Subramanian, Veena; Schmidt, Kristina H",Nucleic acids res,505,1

It is urgent to study the environmental pathogenic factors and transmission route of it. We want to discuss the relationship between the urban living environment and the number of confirmed cases at the community scale, and examine the driving forces of community infection (e.g., environment, ecology, convenience, livability, and population density). Besides, we hope that our research will help make our cities more inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. 650 communities with confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan were selected as the research objects. We utilize deep learning semantic segmentation technology to calculate the Visible Green Index (VGI) and Sky View Factor (SVF) of street view and use Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to study the driving forces of pandemic situation. Temperature and humidity information recorded by sensors was also used for urban sensing. We find that the more SVF has a certain inhibitory effect on the virus transmission, but contrary to our intuitive perception, higher VGI has a certain promotion effect. Also, the structural equation model constructed in this paper can explain the variance of 28.9% of the number of confirmed cases, and results (path coef.) demonstrate that residential density of community (0.517) is a major influencing factor for pandemic cases, whereas convenience of community living (0.234) strongly influence it. Communities with good suitability of community human settlement (e.g., construction time, price) are safer in the face of pandemic events. Does the influence of SVF and VGI on the results of the pandemic situation mean that sunlight can effectively block the spread of the virus?

This study aimed to develop a model for predicting COVID-19 severity. METHODS: Overall, 690 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were recruited between 1 January and 18 March 2020 from hospitals in Honghu and Nanchang; finally, 442 patients were assessed. Data were categorised into the training and test sets to develop and validate the model, respectively. FINDINGS: A predictive HNC-LL (Hypertension, Neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, Lymphocyte count, Lactate dehydrogenase) score was established using multivariate logistic regression analysis. The HNC-LL score accurately predicted disease severity in the Honghu training cohort (area under the curve [AUC]=0.861, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.800-0.922; P<0.001); Honghu internal validation cohort (AUC=0.871, 95% CI: 0.769-0.972; P<0.001); and Nanchang external validation cohort (AUC=0.826, 95% CI: 0.746-0.907; P<0.001) and outperformed other models, including CURB-65 (confusion, uraemia, respiratory rate, BP, age &#8805;65 years) score model, MuLBSTA (multilobular infiltration, hypo-lymphocytosis, bacterial coinfection, smoking history, hypertension, and age) score model, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio model. The clinical significance of HNC-LL in accurately predicting the risk of future development of severe COVID-19 was confirmed. INTERPRETATION: We developed an accurate tool for predicting disease severity among COVID-19 patients. This model can potentially be used to identify patients at risks of developing severe disease in the early stage and therefore guide treatment decisions.

In addition, it aims to explore the value of social cognitive theory (SCT) in explaining these experiences. DESIGN: Exploratory, deductive approach. METHODS: Qualitative, audio-recorded, semi-structured interviews were conducted from eight women who were members of a private Facebook group'. Data were analysed using theoretical thematic analysis, and SCT was used as a theoretical lens through which the data were interrogated. RESULTS: A number of themes were identified from the women's experiences, with analysis uncovering the superordinate theme 'increased self-efficacy' which provided an understanding of how the group impacted women's experiences and aided them in breastfeeding success. The sub-themes of education, accessibility, online community, normalization, and extended goals provided a more detailed understanding of how self-efficacy was increased through group membership. CONCLUSION: The symbiotic relationship between members of a social media group facilitates greater breastfeeding success and a longer duration of breastfeeding through the central concept of the SCT: reciprocal determinism. Therefore, it is posited that the SCT is a suitable theory of behaviour change which can potentially be used to develop interventions aiming to increase breastfeeding rates and duration.","Black, Rachel; McLaughlin, Marian; Giles, Melanie",Br J Health Psychol,505,15

RESULTS: We find high-speed rail (HSR) and air connectivity with Wuhan resulted in 25.4% and 21.2% increases in the average number of daily new confirmed cases, respectively, while their suspension led to 18.6% and 13.3% decreases in that number.

It took approximately four weeks for this effect to fully materialize, roughly twice the maximum incubation period, and similar dynamic patterns were seen in both HSR and air models. Overall, HSR had a greater impact on COVID-19 development than air transport. CONCLUSIONS: Our research provides important evidence for implementing transportation-related policies in controlling future infectious diseases.","Zhu, Pengyu; Guo, Yuqing",Travel Med Infect Dis,505,20

First, we evaluated changes in tobacco use from pre to post campus closure focusing on smoking and electronic nicotine vaping frequency (days) and quantity (cigarettes/cartridges per day). Also, given the potential protective effects of pausing (temporarily or permanently discontinuing) smoking or vaping, we evaluated its predictors. We hypothesized that generalized anxiety and moving home would increase the odds of pausing. We also explored effects of COVID-related news exposure and seeking on tobacco use. We re-contacted young adults two years after they completed a study on alcohol and marijuana co-use. A subset (N = 83; 26.6% of the 312 respondents) were enrolled in college and reported use of cigarettes (n = 35) and/or e-cigarettes (n = 69) in the week prior to their campus closing (PC). Paired sample t-tests compared smoking and vaping frequency and quantity PC to past-week use since closing (SC). Multivariate logistic regression models were fit to examine predictors of pausing. Both smoking and vaping frequency decreased from PC to SC; however, decreased frequency did not correspond to reduced quantity. Twenty-four participants (28.9%) paused past-week use SC. Higher anxiety and moving home (versus living independently) were related to increased odds of pausing, whereas COVID-19 related news exposure and seeking were related to decreased odds of pausing. Characterizing COVID-19 related tobacco use change provides insights into how college students respond to novel health threats and informs potential interventions.","Sokolovsky, Alexander W; Hertel, Andrew W; Micalizzi, Lauren; White, Helene R; Hayes, Kerri L; Jackson, Kristina M",Addict Behav,505,8

We estimate H1N1 (1) hospitalization rates, (2) severity rates (length of stay, ventilation, pneumonia, and death) of those hospitalized, (3) mortality rates, and (4) time lags between infections and hospitalizations during the pandemic (June 2009 to March 2010) and post-pandemic influenza season (November 2010 to February 2011) in England. METHODS: Estimates of H1N1 infections from a dynamic transmission model are combined with hospitalizations and severity using time series econometric analyses of administrative patient-level hospital data. RESULTS: Hospitalization rates were 34% higher and severity rates of those hospitalized were 20%-90% higher in the post-pandemic period than the pandemic. Adults (45-64-years-old) had the highest ventilation and pneumonia hospitalization rates. Hospitalizations did not lag infection during the pandemic for the young (<24-years-old) but lagged by one or more weeks for all ages in the post-pandemic period. DISCUSSION: The post-pandemic flu season exhibited heightened H1N1 severity, long after the pandemic was declared over. Policymakers should remain vigilant even after pandemics seem to have subsided. Analysis of administrative hospital data and epidemiological modelling estimates can provide valuable insights to inform responses to COVID-19 and future influenza and other disease pandemics.","Lau, Krystal; Dorigatti, Ilaria; Miraldo, Marisa; Hauck, Katharina",Int J Infect Dis,505,16

An Analysis of the European Court of Human Rights' Practice in Light of the Ukrainian Experience,16.472927,2.04174,2020,"Cyber-defense systems are being developed to automatically ingest Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) that contains semi-structured data and/or text to populate knowledge graphs. A potential risk is that fake CTI can be generated and spread through Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) communities or on the Web to effect a data poisoning attack on these systems. Adversaries can use fake CTI examples as training input to subvert cyber defense systems, forcing the model to learn incorrect inputs to serve their malicious needs. In this paper, we automatically generate fake CTI text descriptions using transformers. We show that given an initial prompt sentence, a public language model like GPT-2 with fine-tuning, can generate plausible CTI text with the ability of corrupting cyber-defense systems. We utilize the generated fake CTI text to perform a data poisoning attack on a Cybersecurity Knowledge Graph (CKG) and a cybersecurity corpus. The poisoning attack introduced adverse impacts such as returning incorrect reasoning outputs, representation poisoning, and corruption of other dependent AI-based cyber defense systems. We evaluate with traditional approaches and conduct a human evaluation study with cybersecurity professionals and threat hunters. Based on the study, professional threat hunters were equally likely to consider our fake generated CTI as true.","Ranade, Priyanka; Piplai, Aritran; Mittal, Sudip; Joshi, Anupam; Finin, Tim",,505,11

Moreover, the impact of the disease on hemodialysis centers, the patients, and the health care workers is still not completely understood. Objective: We present the analysis of a COVID-19 outbreak in a hemodialysis center in Belgium and report the incidence, clinical course, and outcome of the disease. Design: A retrospective cross-sectional cohort study. Setting: A hemodialysis center during the COVID-19 outbreak. Patients: A total of 62 patients on maintenance hemodialysis at a tertiary care center in Belgium attended by 26 health care workers. Measurements: Baseline patients’ characteristics were retrieved. The incidence, clinical course, and outcome were reported. The differences between COVID-19 survivors and nonsurvivors were assessed along with the differences between COVID-19-hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients. The incidence of the disease and outcome of health care workers were also reported. Methods: Proportions for categorical variables were compared using the Fisher exact test and χ2. The Mann-Whitney rank sum test was used to compare continuous variables. Univariate analysis and a binomial logistic regression were used to explore variables as predictors of death. Results: Between March 6 and April 14, 2020, 40 of 62 (65%) patients tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome beta coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) along with 18 of 26 (69%) health care professionals. Twenty-five (63%) of the infected patients were hospitalized with a median time for hospitalization-to-discharge of 8 (interquartile range [IQR] = 4-12) days. Eleven (28%) COVID-19-related deaths were recorded with a median time for onset of symptoms-to-death of 9 (IQR = 5-14) days. Lymphocytopenia was prevalent among the cohort and was found in 9 of 11 (82%) reported deaths (P =.4). There was no influence of the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers on COVID-19-related deaths (P =.3). Advanced age, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome were all found to be significantly related to death. Of the 18 infected health care professionals, 13 (72%) were symptomatic and 2 (11%) were hospitalized. There was no reported death among the health care workers. Limitations: Limited follow-up time compared with the course of the disease along with a small sample size. Conclusions: Patients treated with KRT show a high mortality rate secondary to COVID-19. CVD and age are shown to impact survival. Proactive measures must be taken to prevent the spread of the virus in such facilities. Trial Registration: Not applicable as this is a retrospective study.","Mazzoleni, Lionel; Ghafari, Chadi; Mestrez, Fabienne; Sava, Roxana; Bivoleanu, Elena; Delmotte, Philippe; Laurent, France; Roland, Thomas; Rossi, Camelia; Carlier, Stéphane",Can.

We aimed at exploring the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in IBD patients during the two waves. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All IBD patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. They were sorted into two groups (those infected before September 2020, and those from September 2020 to January 2021) and compared by demographic and clinical data. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (out of about 600 with a follow-up visit) were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (4.1%). Sixteen were male and the mean age was 46.5 ± 14.3 years (range 24-74). Six were smokers and 11 had comorbidities; 2 were on steroids and 17 on immunosuppressants or biologics. Three patients (12%) needed hospitalization and other three patients were treated with azithromycin, steroids and LMWH, all of them during the second wave. No patient died or developed any sequelae. Two subjects were infected during the first wave (0.3 vs. 3.83, p<0.0001). Non-significant differences were found between the two groups.

Thus, if the anti-fibrosis modality is efficiently applied, the regeneration capacity of the liver should be reactivated even in such refractory hepatic diseases. METHODS: Rat liver fibrosis was induced by dimethyl-nitrosamine (DMN). Another liver fibrosis model was established in CCl4 treated Sox9CreERT2ROSA26: YFP mice. To resolve hepatic fibrosis, vitamin A coupled liposomes containing siRNA HSP47 (VA-liposome siHSP47) were employed. EpCAM+hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) from GFP rats were transplanted to DMN rat liver to examine their trans-differentiation into hepatic cells after resolution of liver fibrosis. RESULTS: Even under continuous exposure to such strong hepato-toxin as DMN, rats undergoing VA-liposome siHSP47 treatment showed an increment of DNA synthesis of hepatocytes with the concomitant restoration of impaired liver weight and normalization of albumin levels. These results were consistent with the observation that GFP+EpCAM HPCs transplanted to DMN rat liver, trans-differentiated into GFP+ mature hepatic cells after VA-liposome siHSP47 treatment. Another rodent model also proved regeneration potential of the fibrotic liver in CCl4 administered Sox9CreERT2ROSA26: YFP mice, VA-liposome siHSP47 treatment-induced restoration of liver weight and trans-differentiation of YEP+Sox9+cells into YFP+ hepatic cells, though because of relatively mild hepatotoxicity of CCl4, undamaged hepatocytes also proliferated. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated that regeneration of chronically damaged liver indeed occurs after anti-fibrosis treatment even under continuous exposure to hepatotoxin, which promises a significant benefit of the anti-fibrosis therapy for refractory liver diseases.","Sato, Yasushi; Yoneda, Akihiro; Shimizu, Fumiko; Nishimura, Miyuki; Shimoyama, Rai; Tashiro, Yasuyuki; Kurata, Wataru; Niitsu, Yoshiro",J. gastroenterol. hepatol,505,0

The Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist was introduced to address the limited guidance for reporting trial interventions. OBJECTIVES: We will apply the TIDieR checklist to evaluate the completeness of intervention reporting of RCTs in plastic surgery, compare the quality of intervention reporting before and after the guideline was published and evaluate characteristics associated with TIDieR compliance. METHODS: A PubMed search identified one cohort published prior to the release of TIDieR and another published after its release. From the final sample, the TIDieR checklist was applied to intervention descriptions and relevant study characteristics were extracted in a duplicate, blinded manner. RESULTS: 130 trials were included for analysis. The mean TIDieR score was 6.4 out of 12. Five items were reported 90% of the time, while 4 items were reported fewer than 10% of the time. We found that TIDieR publication did not affect intervention reporting (p=.22). CONCLUSION: Our study identified areas in which intervention reporting could be improved. The extent of TIDieR adoption by trialists appears to be limited, and greater efforts are needed to disseminate this reporting guideline if widespread uptake is to be expected. Alternately, it may be beneficial to incorporate TIDieR into the more widely recognized CONSORT statement.","Evans, Sheridan; Rauh, Shelby; Jellison, Samuel; Diener, Brian; Agha, Riaz; Vassar, Matt",,505,29

The pandemic also caused delayed detection of new-onset diabetes in children; this increased the risk and severity of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). We therefore investigated the frequency of new-onset pediatric T1DM and DKA in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic and compared it to the same period in 2019. Methods: We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study, including patients aged 1-14 years admitted with new-onset T1DM or DKA during the COVID-19 pandemic (March-June 2020) and the same period in 2019. We assessed factors including age, sex, anthropometric measures, nationality, duration of diabetes, diabetes management, HbA1c levels, glycemic control, cause of admission, blood gas levels, etiology of DKA, DKA complications, length of hospital stay, and COVID-19 test status. Result: During the lockdown, 106 children, compared with 154 in 2019, were admitted to 6 pediatric diabetes centers. Among the admissions, DKA was higher in 2020 than in 2019 (83% vs. 73%; P=0.05; risk ratio=1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.26), after adjusting for age and sex. DKA frequency among new-onset T1DM and HbA1c levels at diagnosis were higher in 2020 than in 2019 (26% vs. 13.4% [P=<0.001] and 12.1 ± 0.2 vs. 10.8 ± 0.25 [P<0.001], respectively). Females and older patients had a higher risk of DKA. Conclusion: The lockdown implemented in Saudi Arabia has significantly impacted children with T1DM and led to an increased DKA frequency, including children with new-onset T1DM, potentially owing to delayed presentation.","Alaqeel, Aqeel; Aljuraibah, Fahad; Alsuhaibani, Mohammed; Huneif, Mohammed; Alsaheel, Abdulhameed; Dubayee, Mohammad Al; Alsaedi, Abdulaziz; Bakkar, Ayman; Alnahari, Ahmed; Taha, Areej; Alharbi, Khulood; Alanazi, Yousef; Almadhi, Samia; Khalifah, Reem Al",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),505,16

The main challenge of this disease is the primary diagnosis to prevent secondary infections and its spread from one person to another. Therefore, it is essential to use an automatic diagnosis system along with clinical procedures for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 to prevent its spread. Artificial intelligence techniques using computed tomography (CT) images of the lungs and chest radiography have the potential to obtain high diagnostic performance for Covid-19 diagnosis. In this study, a fusion of convolutional neural network (CNN), support vector machine (SVM), and Sobel filter is proposed to detect COVID-19 using X-ray images. A new X-ray image dataset was collected and subjected to high pass filter using a Sobel filter to obtain the edges of the images. Then these images are fed to CNN deep learning model followed by SVM classifier with ten-fold cross validation strategy. This method is designed so that it can learn with not many data. Our results show that the proposed CNN-SVM with Sobel filter (CNN-SVM + Sobel) achieved the highest classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 99.02%, 100% and 95.23%, respectively in automated detection of COVID-19. It showed that using Sobel filter can improve the performance of CNN. Unlike most of the other researches, this method does not use a pre-trained network.

We studied immune responses of 54 COVID-19 patients, 28 of whom had SRF. All patients with SRF displayed either macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) or very low human leukocyte antigen D related (HLA-DR) expression accompanied by profound depletion of CD4 lymphocytes, CD19 lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells.

SARS-CoV-2 patient plasma inhibited HLA-DR expression, and this was partially restored by the IL-6 blocker Tocilizumab; off-label Tocilizumab treatment of patients was accompanied by increase in circulating lymphocytes. Thus, the unique pattern of immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19 is characterized by IL-6-mediated low HLA-DR expression and lymphopenia, associated with sustained cytokine production and hyper-inflammation.","Giamarellos-Bourboulis, Evangelos J; Netea, Mihai G; Rovina, Nikoletta; Akinosoglou, Karolina; Antoniadou, Anastasia; Antonakos, Nikolaos; Damoraki, Georgia; Gkavogianni, Theologia; Adami, Maria-Evangelia; Katsaounou, Paraskevi; Ntaganou, Maria; Kyriakopoulou, Magdalini; Dimopoulos, George; Koutsodimitropoulos, Ioannis; Velissaris, Dimitrios; Koufargyris, Panagiotis; Karageorgos, Athanassios; Katrini, Konstantina; Lekakis, Vasileios; Lupse, Mihaela; Kotsaki, Antigone; Renieris, George; Theodoulou, Danai; Panou, Vassiliki; Koukaki, Evangelia; Koulouris, Nikolaos; Gogos, Charalambos; Koutsoukou, Antonia",,505,10

Minimizing Salmonella colonization of commercial turkeys could decrease the incidence of Salmonella-associated human foodborne illness. Understanding host responses to these bacteria is critical in developing strategies to minimize colonization and reduce food safety risk. In this study, we evaluated bacterial load and blood leukocyte transcriptomic responses of 3-week-old turkeys challenged with the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) UK1 strain. Turkeys (n = 8/dose) were inoculated by oral gavage with 108 or 1010 colony forming units (CFU) of S. Typhimurium UK1, and fecal shedding and tissue colonization were measured across multiple days post-inoculation (dpi). Fecal shedding was 1-2 log10 higher in the 1010 CFU group than the 108 CFU group, but both doses effectively colonized the crop, spleen, ileum, cecum, colon, bursa of Fabricius and cloaca without causing any detectable clinical signs in either group of birds. Blood leukocytes were isolated from a subset of the birds (n = 3-4/dpi) both pre-inoculation (0 dpi) and 2 dpi with 1010 CFU and their transcriptomic responses assayed by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). At 2 dpi, 647 genes had significant differential expression (DE), including large increases in expression of immune genes such as CCAH221, IL4I1, LYZ, IL13RA2, IL22RA2, and ACOD1. IL1ß was predicted as a major regulator of DE in the leukocytes, which was predicted to activate cell migration, phagocytosis and proliferation, and to impact the STAT3 and toll-like receptor pathways. These analyses revealed genes and pathways by which turkey blood leukocytes responded to the pathogen and can provide potential targets for developing intervention strategies or diagnostic assays to mitigate S. Typhimurium colonization in turkeys.","Monson, Melissa S; Bearson, Bradley L; Sylte, Matthew J; Looft, Torey; Lamont, Susan J; Bearson, Shawn M D",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,505,20

This has affected the management of many long-term conditions including osteoporosis as resources are diverted to cover urgent care. Osteoporosis is a public health concern worldwide and treatment is required for the prevention of further bone loss, deterioration of skeletal micro-architecture, and fragility fractures. This review provides information on how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis. We also provide clinical recommendations on the adaptation of care pathways based on experience from five referral centres to ensure that patients with osteoporosis are still treated and to reduce the risk of fractures both for the individual patient and on a societal basis. We address the use of the FRAX tool for risk stratification and initiation of osteoporosis treatment and discuss the potential adaptations to treatment pathways in view of limitations on the availability of DXA. We focus on the issues surrounding initiation and maintenance of treatment for patients on parenteral therapies such as zoledronate, denosumab, teriparatide, and romosozumab during the pandemic. The design of these innovative care pathways for the management of patients with osteoporosis may also provide a platform for future improvement to osteoporosis services when routine clinical care resumes.","Hampson, G; Stone, M; Lindsay, J R; Crowley, R K; Ralston, S H",Calcif. tissue int,505,24

This prospective study aimed to define headache characteristics, associated clinical and laboratory factors, and treatment response in COVID-19. METHODS: Cross-sectional study enrolled 287 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and hospitalized on a regular ward during the pandemic. All patients were examined face to face and followed by a neurologist during their stay in the hospital. The characteristics, concomitant symptoms, treatment responses, and laboratory findings of COVID-19-associated headaches were recorded. RESULTS: Eighty-three COVID-19 patients reported headache (28.9%), in which 85.5% had no prior headaches. Mean age was 48.40 ± 15.90 and 58% was men. Compared to COVID-19 patients without headache (n = 204), patients with headache showed significantly higher frequency of pulmonary involvement (76%) and increased D-dimer levels. Fifty-nine percent of headaches responded iv paracetamol 1000 mg, and 85% of the paracetamol unresponsive headaches were relieved by greater occipital nerve (GON) blocks. Latent class cluster analysis identified 2 distinct class of bilateral, frontal, throbbing headaches: severe (VAS > 84), longer (> 14 h), frequent (> 7 headache days), paracetamol unresponsive-GON responsive headaches (85%), with pulmonary involvement (100%), and higher IL-6 levels (> 90 pg/mL) were classified in cluster 1. Cluster 2 included moderately affected patients (VAS > 54, > 6 h, > 4 days, 60% pulmonary involvement, > 20 pg/mL IL-6) and paracetamol responsive headaches (96%). VAS scores showed positive linear correlation with IL-6 levels (p < 0.001; r = 0.567). CONCLUSION: The intensity, duration, frequency, bilateral frontal location, and treatment response of COVID-19 headache was related to pulmonary involvement and IL-6 levels, which indicated a role of inflammation in determining the headache manifestations in moderately affected hospitalized patients. ROC curve cutoff values pointed that VAS > 70 severity, > 9 h duration, > 5 headache days, and IL-6 > 43 pg/mL levels can be diagnostic for COVID-19 headache. GON blocks can effectively abort headache when patients are unresponsive to paracetamol, and other NSAIDs are avoided during the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Karadas, Ömer; Öztürk, Bilgin; Sonkaya, Ali Riza; Tasdelen, Bahar; Özge, Aynur; Bolay, Hayrunnisa",Neurol Sci,505,9

DESIGN: Online survey using a snowball sampling approach. SETTING: Practitioners working in hospitals, hospices, care homes and community settings across the UK and Ireland. PARTICIPANTS: Health and social care professionals involved in bereavement support. INTERVENTIONS: Brief online survey distributed widely across health and social care organisations. RESULTS: 805 respondents working in hospice, community, and hospital settings across the UK and Ireland completed the survey between 3 August and 4 September 2020. Changes to bereavement care practice were reported in: the use of telephone, video and other forms of remote support (90%); supporting people bereaved from non-COVID conditions (76%), from COVID-19 (65%) and people bereaved before the pandemic (61%); funeral arrangements (61%); identifying bereaved people who might need support (56%); managing complex forms of grief (48%) and access to specialist services (41%). Free-text responses demonstrated the complexities and scale of the impact on health and social care services, practitioners and their relationships with bereaved families, and on bereaved people. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has created major challenges for the support of bereaved people: increased needs for bereavement care, transition to remote forms of support and the stresses experienced by practitioners, among others. The extent to which services are able to adapt, meet the escalating level of need and help to prevent a 'tsunami of grief' remains to be seen. The pandemic has highlighted the need for bereavement care to be considered an integral part of health and social care provision.","Pearce, Caroline; Honey, Jonathan R; Lovick, Roberta; Zapiain Creamer, Nicola; Henry, Claire; Langford, Andy; Stobert, Mark; Barclay, Stephen",BMJ Open,505,16

Evidence has shown increased mortality rates associated with COVID-19 infection. However, little is known about the outcomes of COVID-19 negative patients in a pandemic environment. In addition, the impact of vitamin D levels on mortality in COVID-19 hip fracture patients has yet to be determined. METHODS: This multicentre observational study included 1,633 patients who sustained a hip fracture across nine hospital trusts in North West England. Data were collected for three months from March 2020 and for the same period in 2019. Patients were matched by Nottingham Hip Fracture Score (NHFS), hospital, and fracture type. We looked at the mortality outcomes of COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative patients sustaining a hip fracture. We also looked to see if vitamin D levels had an impact on mortality. RESULTS: The demographics of the 2019 and 2020 groups were similar, with a slight increase in proportion of male patients in the 2020 group. The 30-day mortality was 35.6% in COVID-19 positive patients and 7.8% in the COVID-19 negative patients. There was a potential association of decreasing vitamin D levels and increasing mortality rates for COVID-19 positive patients although our findings did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: In 2020 there was a significant increase in 30-day mortality rates of patients who were COVID-19 positive but not of patients who were COVID-19 negative. Low levels of vitamin D may be associated with high mortality rates in COVID-19 positive patients.

The implementation's timing considered both the chronological date and the epidemiological timing, based on the time since the 10th case or 1st death from COVID-19 in each state. All the states implemented distancing measures, mostly during the latter half of March 2020. Economic lockdown was implemented early, prior to the 10th case by 67% of the states and prior to the 1st death from COVID-19 by 89% of the states. Early social distancing measures were widely implemented in Brazil, before or in the initial phase of the exponential growth curve of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the great majority of states.","Silva, Lara Lívia Santos da; Lima, Alex Felipe Rodrigues; Polli, Démerson André; Razia, Paulo Fellipe Silvério; Pavão, Luis Felipe Alvim; Cavalcanti, Marco Antônio Freitas de Hollanda; Toscano, Cristiana Maria",Cad Saude Publica,505,30

This paper investigates how differences in sunlight, as measured over several years across states and during the same calendar week, affect influenza incidence. We find that sunlight strongly protects against getting influenza. This relationship is driven almost entirely by the severe H1N1 epidemic in fall 2009. A 10% increase in relative sunlight decreases the influenza index in September or October by 1.1 points on a 10-point scale.

Currently, research groups around the globe are trying to figure out such transmission dynamics under special conditions such as separation policies enforced by governments. Mathematical and computational models, like the compartmental model or the agent-based model, are being used for this purpose. This paper proposes an agent-based model, called INFEKTA, for simulating the transmission of infectious diseases, not only the COVID-19, under social distancing policies. INFEKTA combines the transmission dynamic of a specific disease, (according to parameters found in the literature) with demographic information (population density, age, and genre of individuals) of geopolitical regions of the real town or city under study. Agents (virtual persons) can move, according to its mobility routines and the enforced social distancing policy, on a complex network of accessible places defined over an Euclidean space representing the town or city. The transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 under different social distancing policies in Bogotá city, the capital of Colombia, is simulated using INFEKTA with one million virtual persons. A sensitivity analysis of the impact of social distancing policies indicates that it is possible to establish a 'medium' (i.e., close 40% of the places) social distancing policy to achieve a significant reduction in the disease transmission.","Gomez, Jonatan; Prieto, Jeisson; Leon, Elizabeth; Rodríguez, Arles",PLoS One,505,24

Despite frenzied efforts in therapeutic development, there are currently no effective drugs for treatment, nor are there vaccines for its prevention. Drug repurposing, representing as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, is one of the most practical treatment options against the outbreak. In this study, we present a novel strategy for in-silico molecular modeling screening for potential drugs that may interact with multiple main proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Targeting multiple viral proteins is a novel drug discovery concept in that it enables the potential drugs to act on different stages of the virus' life cycle, thereby potentially maximizing the drug potency. We screened 2,631 FDA-approved small molecules against four key proteins of SARS-CoV-2 that are known as attractive targets for anti-viral drug development. In total, we identified 29 drugs that could actively interact with two or more target proteins, with 5 drugs (Avapritinib, Bictegravir, Ziprasidone, Capmatinib and Pexidartinib) being common candidates for all four key host proteins and 3 of them possessing the desirable molecular properties. By overlaying docked positions of drug candidates onto individual host proteins, it has been further confirmed that the binding site conformations are conserved. The drugs identified in our screening provide potential guidance for experimental confirmation such as in vitro molecular assays, in vivo animal testing as well as incorporation into ongoing clinical studies.","Liang, Hualou; Zhao, Liang; Gong, Xiajing; Hu, Meng; Wang, Hongbin",Clinical and translational science (Online),505,30

However, there is not much information available on the toxicity of nanoparticles in neuronal disorders. The toxic effect of nanoparticles on brain disorders and their regulatory issues is the primary concern of the healthcare industry. METHODS: A strategical literature search was performed on a various bibliographic database such as Scopus, PubMed, SciFinder, Google Scholar, Medline, Google patent, Derwent Innovation, and Orbit Intelligence for retrieval of peerreviewed articles and patents on regulatory issues and toxicity of nanoparticles in neuronal disorders over the past four decades or so. The relevant hits of articles and patents were analyzed and citation search for the relevant documents was carried out. RESULTS: The literature documents have been summarized regarding the existing regulatory issues and toxicity of nanoparticles on neuronal disorders with a focus on the detailed mechanism of developmental toxicity of nanoparticles. The focus of this report is to emphasize the negative effects of nanoparticle on neuronal disorders which may partially contribute to management of toxicity of nanoparticles. CONCLUSION: Although nanoparticles have unique physical and chemical properties that explain the broad range of application for the central nervous system, they can also manifest neurotoxic effects due to cell necrosis, a generation of free radicals, immune responses and neuroinflammation. Thus, this review highlights on risk assessment, safety regulations and regulatory guidelines of nanoparticles which may reduce adverse reactions in humans and animals.","Muheem, Abdul; Jahangir, Mohammed Asadullah; Jaiswal, Chandra Prakash; Jafar, Mohammed; Ahmad, Mohammad Zaki; Ahmad, Javed; Warsi, Musarrat Husain",,505,1

We developed a flexible framework that integrates uncertainty from test characteristics, sample size, and heterogeneity in seroprevalence across subpopulations to compare estimates from sampling schemes. Using the same framework and making the assumption that seropositivity indicates immune protection, we propagated estimates and uncertainty through dynamical models to assess uncertainty in the epidemiological parameters needed to evaluate public health interventions and found that sampling schemes informed by demographics and contact networks outperform uniform sampling.

METHODS: In this prospective, observational study, an electronic thermohygrometer was used to obtain the required measurements. A mechanical ventilator was used as a source for high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy. For active humidification, the following equipment was used: a HH with standard disposable water trap circuit, 3 servo-controlled HH, and 7 circuits with a heated wire. Data on environmental conditions (ie, temperature, RH, AH) were collected from the laboratory during each measurement; the temperature, RH, and AH resulting from the application of 8 flows (30-100 L/min) were also recorded. Variables were compared with analysis of variance for repeated measurements with Tukey post hoc tests. A value of P < .05 was assumed to be significant. RESULTS: During the study, a statistically significant difference was found in the average AH for each flow for the different devices (P < .005). The highest AH values were recorded with the Fisher & Paykel MR850 and the Medtronic-DAR circuit (AH = 40.8 mg/L with flow of 50 L/min, P < .005), and the lowest AH values were recorded with the Flexicare FL9000 HH and the Flexicare circuit (AH = 11.4 mg/L with 100 L/min flow, P < .005). For flows > 50 L/min, the best performance for all flows in terms of AH was found with the Fisher & Paykel MR850 HH, regardless of the circuit used. CONCLUSIONS: During oxygen therapy with very high gas flows, HH devices behave differently and in many cases are inefficient in delivering adequate humidification, even at conventional flows. Caution is therefore recommended when selecting the device and flow settings for the implementation of high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy.","Plotnikow, Gustavo A; Villalba, Darío; Gogniat, Emiliano; Quiroga, Corina; Pérez Calvo, Eliana; Scapellato, José Luis",Respir. care,505,16

In this critical commentary, we analyze the effects of these practices on our leisure as two single, professional, childless women who live alone. Women face societal expectations that they will play large roles in caregiving. We argue that in the current pandemic, women who are not responsible for the provision of care may face amplified resentment or belittlement for engaging in regular leisure activities. Further, many people have been limited in interacting with those outside of their household. For those who live alone, this is particularly isolating and has a huge effect on the types of leisure in which they can engage and removes them from their established networks of support and safety. We show that removal from our social and care networks can result in feelings of selfishness, shame, and fear during leisure participation.","Giles, Audrey R.; Oncescu, Jacquelyn",Leis. Sci.,505,16

METHODS: A multidisciplinary team created a guideline providing criteria for establishing initial sensor-meter agreement within each individual patient followed by hybrid use of CGM and POC. POC measures were obtained hourly during initial validation, then every 6 hours. We conducted a focus group among MICU nurses to evaluate initial implementation efforts with content areas focused on initial assessment of evidence, context, and facilitation to identify barriers and facilitators. The focus group was analyzed using a qualitative descriptive approach. RESULTS: The protocol was integrated through a rapid cycle review process and ultimately disseminated nationally. The Diabetes Consult Service performed device set-up and nurses received just-in-time training. The majority of barriers centered on contextual factors, including limitations of the physical environment, complex device set-up, hospital firewalls, need for training, and CGM documentation. Nurses' perceived device accuracy and utility were exceptionally high. Solutions were devised to maximize facilitation and sustainability for nurses while maintaining patient safety. CONCLUSION: Outpatient CGM systems can be implemented in the MICU using a hybrid protocol implementation science approach. These efforts hold tremendous potential to reduce healthcare worker exposure while maintaining glucose control during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Faulds, Eileen R; Jones, Laureen; McNett, Molly; Smetana, Keaton S; May, Casey C; Sumner, Lyndsey; Buschur, Elizabeth; Exline, Matthew; Ringel, Matthew D; Dungan, Kathleen",Endocr. pract,505,1

DESIGN: Rapid response online survey. Participants completed the six-item US Household Food Security Survey Module, a brief measure of food insufficiency, and measures of food behaviours, neighbourhood safety and discrimination. Open-ended questions were used to assess changes in eating behaviours during COVID-19 and needed resources. SETTING: C-EAT (COVID-19 Eating and Activity over Time) study invitations were sent by email and text message to a longitudinal cohort. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 218 emerging adults (mean age = 24·6 (sd 2·0) years, 70·2 % female) completed a survey in April-May 2020 during a stay-at-home order in Minnesota. RESULTS: The past year prevalence of food insecurity was 28·4 %. Among food-insecure respondents, 41·0 % reported both eating less and experiencing hunger due to lack of money in the past month. Food-insecure respondents were less likely than those who were food secure to have fruits/vegetables at home and more likely to have frequent fast-food restaurant meals, feel unsafe in their neighbourhood and experience discrimination during the stay-at-home order. Food-insecure adults reported changes including eating more food prepared at home, eating more take-out restaurant meals and purchasing more energy-dense snacks as a result of events related to COVID-19. Resources most needed to support their health included eligibility for more food assistance and relief funds. CONCLUSIONS: Food-insecure emerging adults experience many barriers to maintaining healthful eating patterns during COVID-19.","Larson, Nicole; Slaughter-Acey, Jaime; Alexander, Tricia; Berge, Jerica; Harnack, Lisa; Neumark-Sztainer, Dianne",Public Health Nutr,505,1

The addition of one or multiple PEG moieties, in either linear or branched form, is known to carry the risk of potentially inducing an immunogenic response against PEG. The importance of accurately quantifying anti-PEG antibodies during a clinical study is well recognized and stems from the fact that anti-PEG antibodies have been shown to negatively impact the efficacy of the biotherapeutic that the PEG is coupled to. As a consequence, sponsors are encouraged to develop immunogenicity assays to assess appropriately the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) against the protein component as well as the PEG. However, detection of anti-PEG antibodies is complicated by a number of technical challenges, including the availability of appropriate positive control material. In addition, the fact that some anti-PEG antibodies are known to circulate as low-affinity IgM, drives the need for an assay able to detect low affinity anti-PEG ADA even in the presence of high concentrations of the biotherapeutic. To address this need, we developed and validated an Affinity Capture Elution (ACE)-AGL assay to detect anti-drug and anti-PEG antibodies. In this assay, which we call ACE-AGL, ADA are captured by biotin-PEG-drug, acid eluted and re-captured on a second plate coated with protein AGL. ADA are then detected using Ruthenium-PEG-drug. The new assay format described is highly sensitive to both anti-drug and anti-PEG antibodies and very drug-tolerant. The ACE-AGL assay is easy to perform and has been successfully validated at two separate CROs. We propose the ACE-AGL format as a valid and effective alternative to the currently available assay methods.","Bivi, Nicoletta; Swearingen, Craig A; Shockley, Travis; Sloan, John H; Pottanat, Thomas G; Carter, Quincy; Hodsdon, Michael; Siegel, Robert; Konrad, Robert J",J Immunol Methods,505,30

When UV light shines on the titanium dioxide, electrons (negatively charged particles inside atoms) are released at its surface. The electrons interact with water molecules (H2O) in the air, breaking them up into hydroxyl radicals (OH·), 9which are highly reactive, short-lived, uncharged forms of hydroxide ions (OH-). These small, agile hydroxyl radicals then attack bigger organic (carbon-based like virus) pollutant molecules, breaking apart their chemical bonds and turning them into harmless substances such as carbon dioxide and water. Current investigation uses the above principle to kill living organic germs, bacteria;pathogen, etc. from the cabin air in recirculation mode. A HVAC system has been developed by using a filter impregnated by titanium di-oxide (TiO2) with UV lights to improve and maintain cabin air quality.

We apply principal component analysis to a similarity matrix that compares all pairs of these SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequences at all loci simultaneously, using the Jaccard index. Our analysis results of the SARS-CoV-2 genome data illustrates the geographic and chronological progression of the virus, starting from the first cases that were observed in China to the current wave of cases in Europe and North America. This is in line with a phylogenetic analysis which we use to contrast our results. We also observe that, based on their sequence data, the SARS-CoV-2 viruses cluster in distinct genetic subgroups. It is the subject of ongoing research to examine whether the genetic subgroup could be related to diseases outcome and its potential implications for vaccine development.","Hahn, Georg; Lee, Sanghun; Weiss, Scott T; Lange, Christoph",Genet Epidemiol,505,1

These psychological problems have been seen in either normal people during the lockdown (who are waiting to get infected with COVID-19) and patients with COVID-19 (who are waiting for death). These psychological problems adversely affect immune functions causing more increase in the severity of COVID-19 associated disorders and death rates. Increasing the aerobic capacity is one of the effective methods that could be used to decrease stress, anxiety, and depression. Besides, increasing the aerobic capacity increases immune functions through autonomic regulation. Thus, this review was developed to summarize the effect of increasing the aerobic capacity on psycho-immune hormones commonly disturbed in people during the lockdown or patients with COVID-19 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This review was carried out by searching through Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO, Medline databases. The search was conducted over clinical trials, literature reviews, and systematic reviews. The search included the possible effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on the functions of psycho-immune hormones. RESULTS: This review found that increasing the aerobic capacity can decrease psychological problems commonly seen in people with COVID-19 and increase immune functions by modulating the levels of glucocorticoid, oxytocin, insulin, thyroid hormones. CONCLUSIONS: This review demonstrated that increasing the aerobic capacity is a recommended treatment for decreasing the psychological problems commonly seen in people with COVID-19 because it has the potential for decreasing psychological problems and improving immune functions which would help counter COVID-19.","Amro, M; Mohamed, A; Alawna, M",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,505,22

The present study aimed to investigate the clinical value and functional role of CELSR3 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and determine the underlying molecular mechanism in patients with HCC. CELSR3 expression in tumor and paracancerous HCC tissues was obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Differential expression analysis was performed using the edgeR package. Pearson correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between methylation and mRNA levels of CELSR3. Pathways affected by aberrant CELSR3 expression were identified through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. The results demonstrated that CELSR3 was highly expressed in the early stage of cancer and was present throughout the entire cancer process, which suggested that CELSR3 may serve a key role in the carcinogenesis of HCC. In addition, upregulation of CELSR3 was associated with its methylation level; high CELSR3 expression indicated a shorter overall survival time. Multiple candidate genes were screened by integrating differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs and target genes of DE microRNAs (miRs). Subsequent pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that the upregulated genes were predominantly enriched in the 'Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction' and 'Cell cycle' pathways, whereas the downregulated genes were primarily enriched in 'Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction' and 'Metabolic pathways'. CELSR3 and its connected nodes and edges were initially removed from the miRNA-mRNA regulatory network in order to prevent bias and compared with the network containing CELSR3 alone. The frequently dysregulated miRNAs were identified as miR-181 family members, and the results suggested that miR-181 and the Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway influenced CELSR3 expression.","Ouyang, Xiwu; Wang, Zhiming; Yao, Lei; Zhang, Gewen",Oncol Lett,505,1

OBJECTIVES: This review summarizes the underlying principles and performance of COVID-19 serological and immunological testing. SOURCES: Selected peer-reviewed publications on COVID-19 related serology and immunology published between December 2019 and March 2021. CONTENT: Serological tests are highly specific but heterogeneous in their sensitivity for the diagnosis of COVID-19. For certain indications, including delayed disease presentations, serological tests can have added value. The presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 may indicate a recent or past COVID-19 infection. Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) antibody tests have the advantages of being easy and fast to perform, but many have a low sensitivity in acute settings. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIAs) have higher sensitivities. Besides humoral immunity, cellular immunity is also essential for successful host defences against viruses. Enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assays can be used to measure T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2. The presence of cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in never exposed patients suggests the possibility of cellular immunity induced by other circulating coronaviruses. T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 have also been detected in recovered COVID-19 patients with no detectable antibodies. IMPLICATIONS: Serological and immunological tests are primarily applied for population-based seroprevalence studies to evaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 control measures and increase our understanding of the immunology behind COVID-19. Combining molecular diagnostics with serological tests may optimize the detection of COVID-19. As not all infected patients will develop antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, assessment of cellular immunity may provide complementary information on whether a patient has been previously infected with COVID-19. More studies are needed to understand the correlations of these serological and immunological parameters with protective immunity, taking into account the different circulating virus variants.","Ong, David S Y; Fragkou, Paraskevi C; Schweitzer, Valentijn A; Chemaly, Roy F; Moschopoulos, Charalampos D; Skevaki, Chrysanthi",Clin Microbiol Infect,505,1

Many are faced with increased stress, and other negative effects on their mental health. They are also faced with the possibility of infection and death from COVID-19. Before the pandemic there was a global shortage of nurses, but this is likely to be exacerbated by the increased demands of caring during COVID-19 as well as the usual care of non-COVID patients. One serious concern is that the pandemic and multitudinous effects on the nursing profession will exacerbate nursing attrition and their poor mental health into the future. Another serious concern is whether the profession will be able to attract sufficient numbers of nurses to care for populations into the future. Governments and health policymakers everywhere need to invest in nursing and health care and pay attention to the needs of health systems to ensure a healthy population. It is argued that without this, economies will not recover and prosper, and health systems will not be able to provide quality care.","Turale, Sue; Nantsupawat, Apiradee",Int Nurs Rev,505,16

We have engineered a vitreous substitute comprised of a novel hyaluronan-oxime crosslinked hydrogel. Hyaluronan, which is naturally abundant in the vitreous of the eye, is chemically modified to crosslink with poly(ethylene glycol)-tetraoxyamine via oxime chemistry to produce a vitreous substitute that has similar physical properties to the native vitreous including refractive index, density and transparency. The oxime hydrogel is cytocompatible in vitro with photoreceptors from mouse retinal explants and biocompatible in rabbit eyes as determined by histology of the inner nuclear layer and photoreceptors in the outer nuclear layer. The ocular pressure in the rabbit eyes was consistent over 56 d, demonstrating limited to no swelling. Our vitreous substitute was stable in vivo over 28 d after which it began to degrade, with approximately 50% loss by day 56. We confirmed that the implanted hydrogel did not impact retina function using electroretinography over 90 days versus eyes injected with balanced saline solution.

Materials and Methods: In this survey study, an online questionnaire consisting of 40 questions was directed to actively working ophthalmologists. The questions asked about demographic characteristics, working conditions and schedule, follow-up of ophthalmology patients, and levels of knowledge and anxiety about the pandemic. Results: This study included 161 ophthalmologists (78 women and 83 men). They were predominantly consultant ophthalmologists (71%), with 128 living in metropolitan areas. More than half (54.4%) reported decreased weekly working hours, 52.5% were attending routine outpatient clinics, 52.8% were working in COVID-19-related units, 67.1% were performing only emergency operations, and 52% reported disrupted follow-up of chronic eye patients. Sixty-four percent thought that ophthalmologists were in the high-risk group, and nearly all participants used masks while working (99%). Additionally, 91% expressed high anxiety regarding the pandemic, most commonly due to the risk of transmitting the disease to family (83%), and 12.5% considered their level of knowledge about the pandemic to be insufficient. Forty-six percent of the participants thought that daily life conditions would normalize in 2 to 5 months. Conclusion: Close proximity during patient examination causes ophthalmologists concern about their risk. The increasing number of COVID-19 cases resulted in a proportional decrease in the number of patients and surgeries in ophthalmology clinics in our country. As a result, ophthalmologists are unwillingly appointed to high-risk units.

Previously, we reported that cardenolides impart anti-transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (anti-TGEV) activity through the targeting of Na+/K+-ATPase and its associated PI3K_PDK1_RSK2 signaling. Swine testis cells with Na+/K+-ATPase &#945;1 knocked down exhibited decreased susceptibility to TGEV infectivity and attenuated PI3K_PDK1_RSK2 signaling. Herein, we further explored a Na+/K+-ATPase-independent signaling axis induced by natural cardenolides that also afforded significant anti-coronaviral activity for porcine TGEV and human HCoV-OC43. Using pharmacological inhibition and gene silencing techniques, we found that this anti-TGEV or anti-HCoV-OC43 activity was caused by JAK1 proteolysis and mediated through upstream activation of Ndfip1/2 and its effector NEDD4. This study provides novel insights into the pharmacological effects of natural cardenolides, and is expected to inform their future development as antiviral agents.","Yang, Cheng-Wei; Hsu, Hsing-Yu; Chang, Hsin-Yu; Lee, Yue-Zhi; Lee, Shiow-Ju",Biochem Pharmacol,505,16

We evaluated the impact of two aerosol boxes (an early-generation box and a latest-generation box) on intubations in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 with an in-situ simulation crossover study. The simulated process complied with the Safe Airway Society coronavirus disease 2019 airway management guidelines. The primary outcome was intubation time; secondary outcomes included first-pass success and breaches to personal protective equipment. All intubations were performed by specialist (consultant) anaesthetists and video recorded. Twelve anaesthetists performed 36 intubations. Intubation time with no aerosol box was significantly shorter than with the early-generation box (median (IQR [range]) 42.9 (32.9-46.9 [30.9-57.6])s vs. 82.1 (45.1-98.3 [30.8-180.0])s p = 0.002) and the latest-generation box (52.4 (43.1-70.3 [35.7-169.2])s, p = 0.008). No intubations without a box took more than 1 min, whereas 14 (58%) intubations with a box took over 1 min and 4 (17%) took over 2 min (including one failure). Without an aerosol box, all anaesthetists obtained first-pass success. With the early-generation and latest-generation boxes, 9 (75%) and 10 (83%) participants obtained first-pass success, respectively. One breach of personal protective equipment occurred using the early-generation box and seven breaches occurred using the latest-generation box. Aerosol boxes may increase intubation times and therefore expose patients to the risk of hypoxia. They may cause damage to conventional personal protective equipment and therefore place clinicians at risk of infection. Further research is required before these devices can be considered safe for clinical use.","Begley, J L; Lavery, K E; Nickson, C P; Brewster, D J",Anaesthesia,505,6

Chronic hemodialysis makes social distancing difficult to achieve. Alternatively, kidney transplantation could increase the severity of COVID-19 due to therapeutic immunosuppression and contribute to saturation of intensive care units. For these reasons, kidney transplantation was suspended in France during the first epidemic wave. Here, we retrospectively evaluated this strategy by comparing the overall and COVID-19 related mortality in kidney transplant recipients and candidates over the last three years. Cross-interrogation of two national registries for the period 1 March and 1 June 2020, identified 275 deaths among the 42812 kidney transplant recipients and 144 deaths among the 16210 candidates. This represents an excess of deaths for both populations, as compared with the same period the two previous years (mean of two previous years: 253 in recipients and 112 in candidates). This difference was integrally explained by COVID-19, which accounted for 44% (122) and 42% (60) of the deaths in recipients and candidates, respectively. Taking into account the size of the two populations and the geographical heterogeneity of virus circulation, we found that the excess of risk of death due to COVID-19 was similar for recipients and candidates in high viral risk area but four-fold higher for candidates in the low viral risk area. Thus, in case of a second epidemic wave, kidney transplantation should be suspended in high viral risk areas but maintained outside those areas, both to reduce the excess of deaths of candidates and avoid wasting precious resources.","Thaunat, Olivier; Legeai, Camille; Anglicheau, Dany; Couzi, Lionel; Blancho, Gilles; Hazzan, Marc; Pastural, Myriam; Savoye, Emilie; Bayer, Florian; Morelon, Emmanuel; Le Meur, Yann; Bastien, Olivier; Caillard, Sophie",Kidney Int,505,20

AIMS: To summarize evidence from human clinical studies for using HCQ or CQ as antiviral agents for any viral infection. SOURCES: PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science for published studies without time or language restrictions; Cochrane Clinical Trial Registry and Chinese Clinical Trials Registry for trials registered after 2015; MedRxiv for preprints within the last 12 months. CONTENT: Study eligibility criteria were interventional and prospective observational studies (with or without a control group). Participants were adults and children with a confirmed viral infection. Interventions included the use of CQ or HCQ as antiviral agent in one or more groups of the study. Two authors independently screened abstracts, and all authors agreed on eligible studies. A meta-analysis was planned if studies were available which were similar in terms of participants, intervention, comparator and outcomes. Nineteen studies (including two preprints) were eligible (HIV 8, HCV 2, dengue 2, chikungunya 1, COVID-19 6). Nine and ten studies assessed CQ and HCQ respectively. Benefits of either drug for viral load suppression in HIV are inconsistent. CQ is ineffective in curing dengue (high-certainty evidence) and may have little or no benefit in curing chikungunya (low-certainty evidence). The evidence for COVID-19 infection is rapidly evolving but at this stage we are unsure whether either CQ or HCQ has any benefit in clearing viraemia (very-low-certainty evidence). IMPLICATIONS: Using HCQ or CQ for HIV/HCV infections is now clinically irrelevant as other effective antivirals are available for viral load suppression (HIV) and cure (HCV). There is no benefit of CQ in dengue, and the same conclusion is likely for chikungunya. More evidence is needed to confirm whether either HCQ or CQ is beneficial in COVID-19 infection.","Rodrigo, C; Fernando, S D; Rajapakse, S",Clin Microbiol Infect,505,6

Particularly, coronaviruses are mentioned among the viruses implicated in autoimmunity. Today, the world's greatest threat derives from the pandemic of a new human coronavirus, called ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"" (SARS-CoV-2), the responsible agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, China in December 2019 and, to date, has spread to at least 187 countries. This review focuses on autoimmune manifestations described during COVID-19, including pro-thrombothic state associated to antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), acute interstitial pneumonia, macrophage activation syndrome, lymphocytopenia, systemic vasculitis, and autoimmune skin lesions. This offers the opportunity to highlight the pathogenetic mechanisms common to COVID19 and several autoimmune diseases, in order to identify new therapeutic targets. In a supposed preliminary pathogenetic model, SARS-CoV-2 plays a direct role in triggering widespread microthrombosis and microvascular inflammation, because it is able to induce transient aPL, endothelial damage and complement activation at the same time. Hence, endothelium might represent the common pathway in which autoimmunity and infection converge. In addition, autoimmune phenomena in COVID-19 can be explained by regulatory T cells impairment and cytokines cascade.","Fatone, Maria Celeste",Current rheumatology reviews (Online),505,33

Just-in-time training has been an efficient solution for rapidly equipping health care workers with new knowledge, skills, and attitudes during emergencies; thus, it could also be an effective training technique in the context of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of the unexpected magnitude of this health crisis, the health care workforce must be trained in two areas: (1) basic infection prevention and control, including public health skills that are the core of population-based health management and (2) disaster medicine principles, such as surge capacity, allocation of scarce resources, triage, and the ethical dilemmas of rationing medical care.

Moreover, this training was intended to address the basic principles of disaster medicine applied to the COVID-19 pandemic. Such training was essential in enabling staff to rapidly attain competencies that most of them lacked because disaster medicine and global health are not included in the curricula of Italian medical and nursing schools.

To estimate whether test positivity may assist in policy-making, it was explored in the first 60 to 90 epidemic days in six Latin American countries that reported their first COVID-19 case between February and March, 2020: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Cuba, Mexico, and Uruguay. Test positivity (TP) is the percentage of test-positive individuals recorded on a given day out of all individuals tested on the same day. The epidemic data of the country infected last (Uruguay) was first analyzed to evaluate TP as well as: (i) the daily ratio of secondary over primary infections (apparent reproductive ratio or ARR); (ii) tests conducted per million inhabitants (TPMI), (iii) the temporal data on the number of active cases (all test-positive cases minus deaths and recovered patients), and (iv) that of recovered patients. Later, significant patterns identified in the first step were assessed in the six countries. The Uruguayan data indicated that (i) TP was positively correlated with the ARR (r=.92, p<0.01); (ii) TP informed more than the ARR: while major data departures revealed by the ARR were also detected by TP, TP exhibited patterns not shown by ARR; and (iii) three temporal stages were observed, which differed from one another in both TP and TPMI medians (P<0.01) and, together, revealed a negative relationships between TPMI and TP. The six Latin American countries showed that TP was positively correlated with deaths/million inhabitants or DMI (r=.62, p<0.01). The temporal analysis of policies revealed four patterns: (1) low testing and high DMI, (2) high testing and low DMI; (3) an intermediate pattern, and (4) high testing and high DMI (where isolation was not pursued). Findings support the hypothesis that test positivity may inform as much as, if not more than classic metrics, such as the TPMI.

Decreases in heart rate variability (HRV) correlate with worsening of disease states. This observational study tracks changes in HRV relative to changes in CRP in COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In accordance with an Institutional Review Board-approved study, 17 patients were followed using the wearable, noninvasive Tiger Tech Warfighter Monitor (WFM) that records HRV from a single limb electrocardiogram. Intermittent, daily short-segment data sets of 5 to 7 minutes over a minimum of 7 days were analyzed. Changes in HRV were compared to changes in CRP. RESULTS: Decreases in HRV of greater than 40% preceded a 50% increase in CRP during the ensuing 72 hours in 10 of the 12 patients who experienced a dramatic rise in CRP. The effectiveness of HRV as a leading indicator of a rise in CRP was evaluated; the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for 40% decreases in HRV preceding 50% increases in CRP were 83.3%, 75%, 90.9%, and 60%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Substantial decreases in HRV preceded elevations in CRP in the ensuing 72 hours with a 90.9% positive predictive value. Early detection of increasing inflammation may prove vital in mitigating the deleterious effects of an abnormal inflammatory response, particularly in COVID-19 patients. This capability could have a major impact in triage and care of moderate to severe COVID-19 patients in major medical centers as well as field hospitals. This study demonstrates the potential value of short-segment, intermittent HRV analysis in COVID-19 patients.","Hasty, Frederick; García, Guillermo; Dávila, Col Héctor; Wittels, S Howard; Hendricks, Stephanie; Chong, Stephanie",Mil. med,505,24

Viral RNAs (vRNAs) are central to infection. They carry all the necessary information for a virus to synthesize its proteins, replicate and spread and could also play essential non-coding roles. Regardless of its origin or tropism, vRNA has by definition evolved in the presence of host RNA Binding Proteins (RBPs), which resulted in intricate and complicated interactions with these factors. While on one hand some host RBPs recognize vRNA as non-self and mobilize host antiviral defenses, vRNA must also co-opt other host RBPs to promote viral infection. Focusing on pathogenic RNA viruses, we will review important scenarios of RBP-vRNA interactions during which host RBPs recognize, modify or degrade vRNAs. We will then focus on how vRNA hijacks the largest ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) in the cell, the ribosome, to selectively promote the synthesis of its proteins. We will finally reflect on how novel technologies are helping in deepening our understanding of vRNA-host RBPs interactions, which can be ultimately leveraged to combat everlasting viral threats.","Girardi, Erika; Pfeffer, Sebastien; Baumert, Thomas F; Majzoub, Karim",Semin. cell dev. biol,505,5

Currently, no specific medicine is available to treat infection with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to summarize the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 175 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were hospitalized in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1 to January 31, 2020, and to establish a tool to identify potential critical patients with COVID-19 and help clinical physicians prevent progression of this disease. METHODS: In this retrospective study, clinical characteristics of 175 confirmed COVID-19 cases were collected and analyzed. Univariate analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression were used to select variables. Multivariate analysis was applied to identify independent risk factors in COVID-19 progression. We established a nomogram to evaluate the probability of progression of the condition of a patient with COVID-19 to severe within three weeks of disease onset. The nomogram was verified using calibration curves and receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS: A total of 18 variables were considered to be risk factors after the univariate regression analysis of the laboratory parameters (P<.05), and LASSO regression analysis screened out 10 risk factors for further study. The six independent risk factors revealed by multivariate Cox regression were age (OR 1.035, 95% CI 1.017-1.054; P<.001), CK level (OR 1.002, 95% CI 1.0003-1.0039; P=.02), CD4 count (OR 0.995, 95% CI 0.992-0.998; P=.002), CD8 % (OR 1.007, 95% CI 1.004-1.012, P<.001), CD8 count (OR 0.881, 95% CI 0.835-0.931; P<.001), and C3 count (OR 6.93, 95% CI 1.945-24.691; P=.003). The areas under the curve of the prediction model for 0.5-week, 1-week, 2-week and 3-week nonsevere probability were 0.721, 0.742, 0.87, and 0.832, respectively. The calibration curves showed that the model had good prediction ability within three weeks of disease onset. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a predictive nomogram of critical patients with COVID-19 based on LASSO and Cox regression analysis. Clinical use of the nomogram may enable timely detection of potential critical patients with COVID-19 and instruct clinicians to administer early intervention to these patients to prevent the disease from worsening.","Fan, Tao; Hao, Bo; Yang, Shuo; Shen, Bo; Huang, Zhixin; Lu, Zilong; Xiong, Rui; Shen, Xiaokang; Jiang, Wenyang; Zhang, Lin; Li, Donghang; He, Ruyuan; Meng, Heng; Lin, Weichen; Feng, Haojie; Geng, Qing",JMIR Med Inform,505,16

OBJECTIVE: We compared risk of cardiac adverse events between combinations of chloroquine and azithromycin and chloroquine and amoxicillin. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Medicare Supplemental Databases, 2005-2018. We included autoimmune disease patients aged &#8805;18 years initiating azithromycin or amoxicillin for &#8805;5 days during chloroquine treatment. Patients had continuous insurance coverage &#8805;6 months before combination use until 5 days thereafter or inpatient death. Two outcomes were sudden cardiac arrest/ventricular arrhythmias (SCA/VA) and cardiac symptoms. We followed patients for up to 5 days to estimate hazard ratios (HR). Covariates were adjusted using stabilized inverse probability treatment weighting. RESULTS: We identified two SVC/VA events among >145,000 combination users. The adjusted incidence of cardiac symptoms among azithromycin and amoxicillin users was 276 vs 254 per 10,000 person-years with an adjusted HR of 1.10 (95%CI, 0.62-1.95).

METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and Lilacs databases were used to identify articles published before June 2019 that met specific inclusion criteria. The search strategy was developed using both controlled and uncontrolled vocabulary related to the following domains: ""drug interactions,"" ""clinically relevant,"" and ""hospital."" In this review, we discuss original observational studies that detected DDIs in the hospital setting, studies that provided enough data to allow us to calculate the prevalence of clinically manifested DDIs, and studies that described the drugs prescribed or provided DDI adverse reaction reports, published in either English, Portuguese, or Spanish. RESULTS: From the initial 5,999 articles identified, 10 met the inclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of clinically manifested DDIs was 9.2% (CI 95% 4.0-19.7). The mean number of medications per patient reported in six studies ranged from 4.0 to 9.0, with an overall average of 5.47 ± 1.77 drugs per patient. The quality of the included studies was moderate. The main methods used to identify clinically manifested DDIs were evaluating medical records and ward visits (n = 7). Micromedex® (27.7%) and Lexi-Comp® (27.7%) online reference databases were commonly used to detect DDIs and none of the studies evaluated used more than one database for this purpose. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review showed that, despite the significant prevalence of potential DDIs reported in the literature, less than one in ten patients were exposed to a clinically manifested drug interaction. The use of causality tools to identify clinically manifested DDIs as well as clinical adoption of DDI lists based on actual adverse outcomes that can be identified through the implementation of real DDI notification systems is recommended to reduce the incidence of alert fatigue, enhance decision-making for DDI prevention or resolution, and, consequently, contribute to patient safety.","Gonzaga de Andrade Santos, Tâmara Natasha; Mendonça da Cruz Macieira, Givalda; Cardoso Sodré Alves, Bárbara Manuella; Onozato, Thelma; Cunha Cardoso, Geovanna; Ferreira Nascimento, Mônica Thaís; Saquete Martins-Filho, Paulo Ricardo; Pereira de Lyra, Divaldo; Oliveira Filho, Alfredo Dias de",PLoS One,505,24

Old-World nonhuman primates recapitulate mild to moderate cases of COVID-19, thereby serving as important pathogenesis models. We compared African green monkeys inoculated with infectious SARS-CoV-2 or irradiated, inactivated virus to study the dynamics of virus replication throughout the respiratory tract. Genomic RNA from the animals inoculated with the irradiated virus was found to be highly stable, whereas subgenomic RNA, an indicator of viral replication, was found to degrade quickly. We combined this information with single-cell RNA sequencing of cells isolated from the lung and lung-draining mediastinal lymph nodes and developed new analysis methods for unbiased targeting of important cells in the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Through detection of reads to the viral genome, we were able to determine that replication of the virus in the lungs appeared to occur mainly in pneumocytes, whereas macrophages drove the inflammatory response. Monocyte-derived macrophages recruited to the lungs, rather than tissue-resident alveolar macrophages, were most likely to be responsible for phagocytosis of infected cells and cellular debris early in infection, with their roles switching during clearance of infection. Together, our dataset provides a detailed view of the dynamics of virus replication and host responses over the course of mild COVID-19 and serves as a valuable resource to identify therapeutic targets.","Speranza, Emily; Williamson, Brandi N; Feldmann, Friederike; Sturdevant, Gail L; Pérez-Pérez, Lizzette; Meade-White, Kimberly; Smith, Brian J; Lovaglio, Jamie; Martens, Craig; Munster, Vincent J; Okumura, Atsushi; Shaia, Carl; Feldmann, Heinz; Best, Sonja M; de Wit, Emmie",Sci. transl. med,505,1

Our hypothesis was that, a significant change in the number of pediatric injuries has happened in trauma centers. In the current study, we intend to identify the possible epidemiological shift in pediatric fracture patterns, by comparing the data from 'COVID-19 era' and the mean data from the past 2 years. To the best of our knowledge there are only few reports on epidemiology of pediatric fractures during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Data are reported in two sections. In the descriptive section, epidemiological data regarding pediatric fractures referred to Taleghani tertiary trauma center, including demographics, distribution curves, etiologies and fracture types are presented during the 'COVID era', from 1 March 2020 to 15 April 2020. In the comparative section, the aforementioned data are compared with mean data from the past 2 years, the 'non-COVID era'. RESULTS: Altogether 117 of the 288 trauma children (40.62%) had a fractured bone (145 fractures). Patients were mostly boys, with a mean age of 9.87 years (SD=5.27). The three most common fracture types in children included distal radius, mid-forearm and humeral supracondylar fractures. Compared to non-COVID era, the number of pediatric trauma admissions dropped from 589 to 288. No significant change happened in the mean age, male/female ratio and percentage of motor vehicle accidents. Proportion of proximal humeral, proximal forearm, carpal, and hand fractures declined. The number of open fractures significantly dropped (from 12 to 2). CONCLUSIONS: In Iran, overall trend of pediatric trauma has been decreasing during the outbreak; but the lack of reduction in proportion of accidents may pose an alarm that an effective lock-down has not been imposed.

Hence, the tracking of viral evolutionary trajectories is clearly of great importance. Little is known about SARS-CoV-2 evolution in nonhuman primate models used to test vaccines and therapies and to model human disease. Viral RNA was sequenced from rectal swabs from Chlorocebus aethiops (African green monkeys) after experimental respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two distinct patterns of viral evolution were identified that were shared between all collected samples. First, mutations in the furin cleavage site that were initially present in the virus as a consequence of VeroE6 cell culture adaptation were subsequently lost in virus recovered in rectal swabs, confirming the necessity of this motif for viral infection in vivo. Three amino acid changes were also identified; ORF 1a S2103F, and spike D215G and H655Y, that were detected in rectal swabs from all sampled animals. These findings are demonstrative of intra-host SARS-CoV-2 evolution unique to this nonhuman primate species and may identify a host-adapted variant of SARS-CoV-2 that would be useful in future development of primate disease models.","Rowe, Lori A; Beddingfield, Brandon J; Goff, Kelly; Killeen, Stephanie Z; Chirichella, Nicole R; Melton, Alexandra; ROY, CHAD J; Maness, Nicholas J",,505,5

In March 2020, the WHO declared SARS-CoV-2 a pandemic. The primary diagnostic test is reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, but chest X-ray and computed tomography have become the typical diagnostic tools used to detect abnormal lung changes. Within the framework of the SENTAD COVID Study clinical trial, an observational and analytical study was conducted, where the patients received nebulization therapy with the use of autologous stem cells (group A) compared to the control arm (group B). Both groups received the UAE SARS-CoV-2 standard management. Radiological images of each patient were collected within 24 h of inclusion in the trial and during follow-up. Herein, we describe and evaluate the radiological findings and outcomes. Results: A total of 139 subjects were included in our analysis, 69 in group A and 70 in group B. The most common finding was ground glass opacifications, followed by patchy consolidations, with 20% normal radiological images scored 3 from admission until discharge (p &lt; 0.0001). Our results suggest a significant improvement in radiological images after treatment secondary to the stem cell effect of reducing inflammation and stimulating the pneumological healing process. Conclusions: The use of novel therapies, such as stem cells, shows efficacy not only in terms of the control of clinical and paraclinical signs but also in the radiological changes described in the disease.

This study compared the functional diversity of sessile and mobile invertebrate assemblages that settle over three months on floating vs. non-floating artificial habitats, in two Chilean ports. Using morphological, trophic, behavioral, and life history traits, we found differences between mobile and sessile assemblages regarding the effect of the type of habitat on the functional diversity. Compared to sessile assemblages, a greater functional similarity was observed for mobile assemblages, which suggests that their dispersal capacity enables them to balance the reduced connectivity between settlement structures. No traits, prevailing or selected in one or the other habitat type, was however clearly identified; a result warranting for further studies focusing on more advanced stages of community development.","Figueroa, Naily Nashira; Brante, Antonio; Viard, Frédérique; Leclerc, Jean-Charles",Mar Pollut Bull,505,1

363056,363056,363056,PROMISE: PROMoting youth Involvement and Social Engagement,16.309298,2.052307,2020,"Background: Facing the global COVID-19 pandemic University teaching has been digitalized and German medical faculties took great effort to offer curricular contents online as they agreed that semesters during pandemic should not be suspended. Skill training is an essential part of medical education and cannot be fully digitalized nor should it be omitted. The pandemic demonstrates that skills like ultrasound are essential when treating critical ill patients. Medical faculties use peer assisted learning (PAL) concepts to teach skills, like ultrasound through specially trained student tutors. Aim: Here, we would like to share our experiences and elaborate how ultrasound teaching can be safely performed during the pandemic with an emphasis on adjustment of an existing PAL teaching concept. Method: At the hospital of Saarland University, we implemented a PAL teaching concept for abdominal, including emergency, ultrasound, and echocardiography, called ""sonoBYstudents"" to teach sonography to undergraduate medical students. Students are generally taught in small groups of 5 people in 90min sessions over a time of 8 weeks with an objective structured clinical exam (OSCE) at the end of the course program. Each semester nearly 50 students are taught in abdominal and emergency ultrasound and 30 students in echocardiography. Over five years, more than 600 students have been taught with at least 30 students being trained as student tutors. Given the pandemic, course size, course interval and total course time and total course time were adapted to the hygienic precautions. Results: 45 and 30 students were taught in abdominal ultrasound and echocardiography respectively achieving their learning goals measured via OSCE at the end of the courses. OSCE results were the same when compared to previous semesters. Conclusion: PAL as a teaching concept lives out of sustained educational strategies like practical and didactical trainings and an ongoing recruitment of new student tutors. Suspending PAL and its skill teaching would require starting from the beginning which is a time and cost consuming process. With sonoBYstudents we were able to demonstrate that an existing PAL concept can, with some effort, be adjusted to changing teaching circumstances. Apart from this ultrasound is a non-omittable part of medical skill training with easily appliable hygienic precautions during teaching sessions.","Nourkami-Tutdibi, Nasenien; Hofer, M; Zemlin, M; Abdul-Khaliq, H; Tutdibi, E",GMS J Med Educ,505,16

However, little is known about what factors drive employees' daily decisions to work from home versus office during the pandemic. Taking a social ecological perspective, we conceptualize employees' daily choice of work location (home vs. office) as a way to cope with stressors they have encountered on the previous day, and conducted a daily diary study to examine how five categories of work-related and COVID-related stressors during the pandemic (identified through a pilot interview study) may jointly predict employees' next-day work location. We collected data over five workdays from 127 participants working in a Chinese IT company which allowed employees to choose their work location on a daily basis amid the pandemic. We found that experiencing more work-family boundary stressors and work coordination stressors on a certain day were associated with a greater likelihood of working in the office (vs. at home) on the next day, while experiencing more workload stressors prompted employees to work at home (vs. in the office) on the next day. Furthermore, we found that COVID-19 infection-related stressors moderated the effects of technology stressors and workload stressors on next-day work location. Our research findings offer implications for understanding the driving factors of daily work location choices during and beyond the pandemic.

This study aims at understanding the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 patients with pleural effusion. METHODS: COVID-19 patients were retrospectively enrolled from the Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Pharyngeal swabs from patients were tested using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Patients with COVID-19 were divided into two groups based on their computed tomography (CT) scans for the presence of pleural effusion at admission. We compared the clinical features, laboratory findings, scans and clinical outcomes between the two groups. RESULTS: Pleural effusion was observed in 9.19% of the patients. Patients with pleural effusion were more likely to be severe or critical cases. Moreover, patients with pleural effusion were associated with increased mortality. Of the 799 discharged patients, patients with pleural effusion had longer hospital stays and duration of viral shedding since the onset of symptoms as compared with that for patients without pleural effusion. After discharge, 217 patients visited for a follow-up CT re-examination at the Union Hospital. The CT scans showed that patients with pleural effusion required a longer time to resolve the lung inflammation after the onset of COVID-19 as compared with the time required by patients without pleural effusion. CONCLUSION: This population of patients requires special attention and pleural effusion may be an indicator of poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients.","Wei, Xiao-Shan; Wang, Xu; Ye, Lin-Lin; Niu, Yi-Ran; Peng, Wen-Bei; Wang, Zi-Hao; Zhang, Jian-Chu; Zhou, Qiong",Int J Clin Pract,505,32

At the heart of this was the redeployment of the orthopaedic trainees to support ""frontline specialties"". This paper sheds light on the experience of orthopaedic trainees in redeployment. Methods - In this retrospective study, we asked orthopaedic trainees in the KSS (Kent, Surrey, Sussex) and London Deaneries to complete a survey regarding their experience in redeployment during the COVID-19 outbreak. The study took place in the Kent, Surrey, Sussex, and London regions of the United Kingdom over a period of 8 weeks from 15th of March 2020 until 15th of May 2020. The study was based at East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust and participants were recruited from a number of secondary and tertiary care centres across the region. 120 orthopaedic trainees were contacted, working in 21 teaching hospitals. Of these, 40 trainees (30%) from 13 hospitals responded and completed the survey. Results - 50% of the surveyed trainees were redeployed to other specialties. Trainees spent varying amounts of time in the redeployed speciality and gave differing views on how comfortable they felt and how useful they felt the experience was.

This phenomenon has yet to be directly explored in episodic memory, nor explored for physiological correlates or reaction times. We designed a novel method to elicit the DKE via a test of item recognition while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Throughout the task, participants were asked to estimate the percentile in which they performed compared to others. Results revealed participants in the bottom 25th percentile over-estimated their percentile, while participants in the top 75th percentile under-estimated their percentile, exhibiting the classic DKE. Reaction time measures revealed a condition-by-group interaction whereby over-estimators responded faster than under-estimators when estimating being in the top percentile and responded slower when estimating being in the bottom percentile. Between-group EEG differences were evident between over-estimators and under-estimators during Dunning-Kruger responses, which revealed FN400-like effects of familiarity supporting differences for over-estimators, whereas ""old-new"" memory event-related potential effects revealed a late parietal component associated with recollection-based processing for under-estimators that was not evident for over-estimators. Findings suggest over- and under-estimators use differing cognitive processes when assessing their performance, such that under-estimators may rely on recollection during memory while over-estimators may draw upon excess familiarity when over-estimating their performance. Episodic memory thus appears to play a contributory role in metacognitive judgements of illusory superiority.","Muller, Alana; Sirianni, Lindsey A; Addante, Richard J",Eur. j. neurosci,505,17

However, the kinetics of the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 remains poorly described and relies on the performance of the different serological tests. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the performance of six CE-marked point-of-care tests (POC) and three ELISA assays for the diagnosis of COVID-19 by exploring seroconversions in hospitalized patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS: Both the ELISA and POC tests were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in at least half of the samples collected seven days or more after the onset of symptoms. After 15 days, the rate of detection rose to over 80% but without reaching 100%, irrespective of the test used. More than 90% of the samples collected after 15 days tested positive using the iSIA and Accu-Tell® POC tests and the ID.Vet IgG ELISA assay. Seroconversion was observed 5 to 12 days after the onset of symptoms. Three assays suffer from a specificity below 90% (EUROIMMUN IgG and IgA, UNscience, Zhuhai Livzon). CONCLUSIONS: The second week of COVID-19 seems to be the best period for assessing the sensitivity of commercial serological assays.

The resulting surface showed outstanding photoactivity (combined photocatalytic and photothermal properties) for antimicrobial action, conferring reusability and self-sterilizing ability to the masks. Under solar illumination, the temperature of this photoactive antiviral mask (PAM) rapidly increased to >70 °C, generating a high level of free radicals that disrupted the membrane of nanosized (â¼100 nm) virus-like particles and made the masks self-cleaning and reusable.

Element $z_n$ represents a state of the environment in moment $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and determines three different parameters of the model in that moment. In order to use $RrNGINAR(\mathcal{M,A,P})$ model, one first needs to estimate $\{z_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$, which was so far done by K-means data clustering. We argue that this approach ignores some information and performs poorly in certain situations. We propose a new method for estimating $\{z_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$, which includes the data transformation preceding the clustering, in order to reduce the information loss.

The role of protection motives and religiosity,16.348356,2.582419,2021,"Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) protocol recommends treatment of chest indrawing in 2-59 months old children with oral amoxicillin by trained health facility workers. Whereas, the WHO/UNICEF integrated community case management (iCCM) protocol recommends referral by community level health workers (CLHWs) to a health facility. This study aims to evaluate whether CLHWs can treat chest indrawing pneumonia effectively and safely. Methods: This multi-centre cluster randomized controlled open label, non-inferiority trial will be conducted in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India and Malawi. All sites will use a common protocol with the same study design, participants, intervention, control and outcomes. CLHWs will identify 2-59 months old children with chest indrawing. Study supervisors, trained in the iCCM protocol, will confirm CLHWs' findings. Pulse oximetry will be used to identify hypoxaemic children. In the intervention group, enrolled children will be treated with oral amoxicillin for 5 days, and in the control group they will be referred to a health facility, after providing first dose of oral amoxicillin. An independent outcome assessor will visit each enrolled child on days 6 and 14 of enrolment, to assess study outcomes. Conclusions: If CLHWs can effectively and safely treat chest indrawing pneumonia in 2-59 months old children, it will increase access to pneumonia treatment substantially, as in many settings, health facilities and trained health workers are not easily accessible. Moreover, this evidence will contribute towards the review of the current iCCM protocol and its harmonization with the IMCI protocol.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to sheltering-in-place and telework. While necessary, these strategies may lead to negative consequences such as social isolation and worse performance. However, nature environments have been shown to have a variety of positive effects in several different settings, including improved attention, positive affect, and increased job satisfaction, and these may be translated to the home workspace setting. METHOD: This provides a narrative review of the environmental psychology literature, describing articles involving nature in a task performance or stress context and how it has been applied. It then moves on to discuss how these findings could possibly be applied in the context of workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Although beneficial results are mixed, the review found a variety of relatively simple and cost-effective methods that could assist workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, including taking a break in nature and implementing nature in the workspace. APPLICATION: The application of restorative environment research could be an efficient way of mitigating the negative psychological effects due to at-home sheltering and telework in order to combat COVID-19.","Craig, Curtis M; Neilson, Brittany N; Altman, George C; Travis, Alexandra T; Vance, Joseph A",Hum Factors,505,17

Pregnant women are a group requiring special attention in medicine given the anatomical and physiological changes that occur during pregnancy. Skin rash is commonly associated with pregnancy, with the most common form of an erythematous maculopapular rash being pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy. Skin rash is also an increasingly reported initial presentation in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), due to infection with SARS-CoV-2. CASE REPORT A 34-year-old woman with a diamniotic dichorionic twin pregnancy presented with clinical picture characterized by dermatological manifestations, namely an erythematous and papular skin rash associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. A real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (GeneFinder) test was positive for SARS-CoV-2 detection. CONCLUSIONS Ten months after the onset of this pandemic, there is no conclusive evidence indicating that pregnant women represent a sector more or less vulnerable to severe forms of COVID-19 than the general population.

Confinement as a preventive measure is itself a threat that produces a social impact. Pandemic and confinement have become a psychosocial adversity factor that affects families and their children. During the pandemic, children and adolescents with a psychiatric disorder may experience exacerbation of their symptoms. However, little is known about this, since studies on this population during the pandemic are scarce. Objective: To review the data available in the current literature on the effect of the pandemic on children and adolescents with a previous psychiatric disorder. Methods: A literature search was carried out using PubMed, Scielo and, due to the exceptional conditions of the pandemic situation, directly using internet search engines. Both English and Spanish papers were included. Results: The information found is presented in the following sections: family and children during the pandemic, evaluation of mental disorders in children and young people during the pandemic, pre-existing psychiatric disorders during the pandemic, and telepsychiatric care. Specific information is presented on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The current pandemic due to COVID-19 and confinement are a psychosocial adversity that threatens the stability of the family. Such a stressor can cause exacerbation of symptoms of a previous mental disorder. Children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders are a vulnerable population and require specialised care. Telepsychiatry is becoming a modality with multiple advantages.","Palacio-Ortiz, Juan David; Londoño-Herrera, Juan Pablo; Nanclares-Márquez, Alejandro; Robledo-Rengifo, Paula; Quintero-Cadavid, Claudia Patricia",Rev.

The real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is the most used technique in virus detection. However, possible false-negative and false-positive results produce misleading consequences, making it necessary to improve existing methods. Here, we developed a multiplex rRT-PCR diagnostic method, which targets two viral genes (RdRP and E) and one human gene (RP) simultaneously. The reaction was tested by using pseudoviral RNA and human target mRNA sequences as a template. Also, the protocol was validated by using 14 clinical SARS-CoV-2 positive samples. The results are in good agreement with the CDC authorized Cepheid`s Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic system (100%). Unlike single gene targeting strategies, the current method provides the amplification of two viral regions in the same PCR reaction. Therefore, an accurate SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assay was provided, which allows testing of 91 samples in 96-well plates in per run. Thanks to this strategy, fast, reliable, and easy-to-use rRT-PCR method is obtained to diagnose SARS-CoV-2.","Tombuloglu, Huseyin; Sabit, Hussein; Al-Suhaimi, Ebtesam; Al Jindan, Reem; Alkharsah, Khaled R",PLoS One,505,32

The main 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLPro ) enzyme of SARS-CoV-2, which operates its replication, could be used as a medication discovery point. We therefore theoretically studied and docked the effects of 19 hydrolysable tannins on SARS-CoV-2 by assembling with the catalytic dyad residues of its 3CLpro using molecular operating environment (MOE 09). Results discovered that pedunculagin, tercatain, and castalin intensely interacted with the receptor binding site and catalytic dyad (Cys145 and His41) of SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses estimated that the top three hits might serve as potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 leading molecules for additional optimization and drug development process to combat COVID-19. This study unleashed that tannins with specific structure could be utilized as natural inhibitors against COVID-19. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The 3CLPro controls SARS-CoV-2 copying and manages its life series, which was targeted in case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV coronavirus. About 19 hydrolysable tannins were computed against 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2. Pedunculagin, tercatain, and castalin interacted with Cys145 and His41 of SARS-CoV-2-3CLpro . Pedunculagin-SARS-CoV-2-3CLpro remain stable, with no obvious fluctuations. We predicted that the understandings gained in the current research may evidence valued for discovering and unindustrialized innovative natural inhibitors for COVID-19 in the nearby future.","Khalifa, Ibrahim; Zhu, Wei; Mohammed, Hammad Hamed Hammad; Dutta, Kunal; Li, Chunmei",J Food Biochem,505,24

Although trial staff have expertise in describing barriers to and facilitators of recruitment, a specific focus on understanding recruitment from the point of view of trial staff is rare, and because trial staff are responsible for meeting recruitment targets, a lack of research on their point of view is a key limitation. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to understand recruitment from the point of view of trial staff and discover what they consider important. METHODS: We applied pluralistic ethnographic methods, including analysis of trial documents, observation, and focus groups, and explored the recruitment processes of the EMPOWER (Early Signs Monitoring to Prevent Relapse in Psychosis and Promote Well-being, Engagement, and Recovery) feasibility trial, which is a digital app-based intervention for people diagnosed with schizophrenia. RESULTS: Recruitment barriers were categorized into 2 main themes: service characteristics (lack of time available for mental health staff to support recruitment, staff turnover, patient turnover [within Australia only], management styles of community mental health teams, and physical environment) and clinician expectations (filtering effects and resistance to research participation). Trial staff negotiated these barriers through strategies such as emotional labor (trial staff managing feelings and expressions to successfully recruit participants) and trying to build relationships with clinical staff working within community mental health teams. CONCLUSIONS: Researchers in clinical trials for digital psychosis interventions face numerous recruitment barriers and do their best to work flexibly and to negotiate these barriers and meet recruitment targets. The recruitment process appeared to be enhanced by trial staff supporting each other throughout the recruitment stage of the trial.","Allan, Stephanie; Mcleod, Hamish; Bradstreet, Simon; Bell, Imogen; Whitehill, Helen; Wilson-Kay, Alison; Clark, Andrea; Matrunola, Claire; Morton, Emma; Farhall, John; Gleeson, John; Gumley, Andrew",JMIR Hum Factors,505,7

High age, several comorbidities as well as poor physical fitness can negatively influence the outcome within COVID-19 infection. We investigated whether the ratio of fat to muscle area, measured in initial LDCT, can predict severe progression of COVID-19 in the follow-up period. METHOD: We analyzed 58 individuals with confirmed COVID-19 infection that underwent an initial LDCT in one of two included centers due to COVID-19 infection. Using the ratio of waist circumference per paravertebral muscle circumference (FMR), the body composition was estimated. Patient outcomes were rated on an ordinal scale with higher numbers representing more severe progression or disease associated complications (hospitalization/ intensive care unit (ICU)/ tracheal intubation/ death) within a follow-up period of 22 days after initial LDCT. RESULTS: In the initial LDCT a significantly higher FMR was found in patients requiring intensive care treatment within the follow-up period. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, FMR (pâ¯<â¯.001) in addition to age (pâ¯<â¯.01), was found to be a significant predictor of the necessity for ICU treatment of COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: FMR as potential surrogate of body composition and obesity can be easily determined in initial LDCT of COVID-19 patients. Within the multivariate analysis, in addition to patient age, low muscle area in proportion to high fat area represents an additional prognostic information for the patient outcome and the need of an ICU treatment during the follow-up period within the next 22 days. This multicentric pilot study presents a method using an initial LDCT to screen opportunistically for obese patients who have an increased risk for the need of ICU treatment. While clinical capacities, such as ICU beds and ventilators, are more crucial than ever to help manage the current global corona pandemic, this work introduces an approach that can be used for a cost-effective way to help determine the amount of these rare clinical resources required in the near future.","Kottlors, Jonathan; Zopfs, David; Fervers, Philipp; Bremm, Johannes; Abdullayev, Nuran; Maintz, David; Tritt, Stephanie; Persigehl, Thorsten",Eur J Radiol,505,2

Since the early phase of the pandemic, the ""cytokine-storm"" appeared a peculiar aspect of SARS-COV-2 infection which, at least in the severe cases, is responsible for respiratory treat damage and subsequent multi-organ failure. The efforts made in the last few months elucidated that the cytokine-storm results from a complex network involving cytokines/chemokines/infiltrating-immune-cells which orchestrate the aberrant immune response in COVID-19. Clinical and experimental studies aimed at depicting a potential ""immune signature"" of SARS-COV-2, identified three main ""actors,"" namely the cytokine IL-6, the chemokine CXCL10 and the infiltrating immune cell type macrophages. Although other cytokines, chemokines and infiltrating immune cells are deeply involved and their role should not be neglected, based on currently available data, IL-6, CXCL10, and infiltrating macrophages could be considered prototype factors representing each component of the immune system. It rapidly became clear that a strong and continuous interplay among the three components of the immune response is mandatory in order to produce a severe clinical course of the disease. Indeed, while IL-6, CXCL10 and macrophages alone would not be able to fully drive the onset and maintenance of the cytokine-storm, the establishment of a IL-6/CXCL10/macrophages axis is crucial in driving the sequence of events characterizing this condition. The present review is specifically aimed at overviewing current evidences provided by both in vitro and in vivo studies addressing the issue of the interplay among IL-6, CXCL10 and macrophages in the onset and progression of cytokine storm.

METHODS: We analyzed the expression of MRGs using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data to screen differentially expressed MRGs (DE-MRGs) significantly correlated with EC patient prognosis. Functional pathway enrichment analysis of the DE-MRGs was performed. LASSO and Cox regression analyses were performed to select MRGs closely related to EC patient outcomes. A prognostic signature was developed, and the efficacy was validated in part of and the entire TCGA EC cohort. Moreover, we developed a comprehensive nomogram including the risk model and clinical features to predict EC patients' survival probability. RESULTS: Forty-seven DE-MRGs were significantly correlated with EC patient prognosis. Functional enrichment analysis showed that these MRGs were highly enriched in amino acid, glycolysis, and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Nine MRGs were found to be closely related to EC patient outcomes: CYP4F3, CEL, GPAT3, LYPLA2, HNMT, PHGDH, CKM, UCK2 and ACACB. Based on these nine DE-MRGs, we developed a prognostic signature, and its efficacy in part of and the entire TCGA EC cohort was validated. The nine-MRG signature was independent of other clinical features, and could effectively distinguish high- and low-risk EC patients and predict patient OS. The nomogram showed excellent consistency between the predictions and actual survival observations.

We investigated the clinical-epidemiological findings of 1641 autoimmune systemic disease Italian patients during the Covid-19 pandemic. METHOD: This observational multicenter study included 1641 unselected patients with autoimmune systemic diseases from three Italian geographical areas with different prevalence of Covid-19 [high in north (Emilia Romagna), medium in central (Tuscany), and low in south (Calabria)] by means of telephone 6-week survey. Covid-19 was classified as (1) definite diagnosis of Covid-19 disease: presence of symptomatic Covid-19 infection, confirmed by positive oral/nasopharyngeal swabs; (2) highly suspected Covid-19 disease: presence of highly suggestive symptoms, in absence of a swab test. RESULTS: A significantly higher prevalence of patients with definite diagnosis of Covid-19 disease, or with highly suspected Covid-19 disease, or both the conditions together, was observed in the whole autoimmune systemic disease series, compared to ""Italian general population"" (p = .030, p = .001, p = .000, respectively); and for definite + highly suspected diagnosis of Covid-19 disease, in patients with autoimmune systemic diseases of the three regions (p = .000, for all comparisons with the respective regional general population). Moreover, significantly higher prevalence of definite + highly suspected diagnosis of Covid-19 disease was found either in patients with various ""connective tissue diseases"" compared to ""inflammatory arthritis group"" (p < .000), or in patients without ongoing conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs treatments (p = .011). CONCLUSIONS: The finding of a higher prevalence of Covid-19 in patients with autoimmune systemic diseases is particularly important, suggesting the need to develop valuable prevention/management strategies, and stimulates in-depth investigations to verify the possible interactions between Covid-19 infection and impaired immune-system of autoimmune systemic diseases. Key Points â¢ Significantly higher prevalence of Covid-19 is observed in a large series of patients with autoimmune systemic diseases compared to the Italian general population, mainly due to patients' increased susceptibility to infections and favored by the high exposure to the virus at medical facilities before the restriction measures on individual movement. â¢ The actual prevalence of Covid-19 in autoimmune systemic diseases may be underestimated, possibly due to the wide clinical overlapping between the two conditions, the generally mild Covid-19 disease manifestations, and the limited availability of virological testing. â¢ Patients with ""connective tissue diseases"" show a significantly higher prevalence of Covid-19, possibly due to deeper immune-system impairment, with respect to ""inflammatory arthritis group"". â¢ Covid-19 is more frequent in the subgroup of autoimmune systemic diseases patients without ongoing conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, mainly hydroxyl-chloroquine and methotrexate, which might play some protective role against the most harmful manifestations of Covid-19.","Ferri, Clodoveo; Giuggioli, Dilia; Raimondo, Vincenzo; L039,; Andolina, Massimo; Tavoni, Antonio; Cecchetti, Riccardo; Guiducci, Serena; Ursini, Francesco; Caminiti, Maurizio; Varcasia, Giuseppe; Gigliotti, Pietro; Pellegrini, Roberta; Olivo, Domenico; Colaci, Michele; Murdaca, Giuseppe; Brittelli, Raffaele; Mariano, Giuseppa Pagano; Spinella, Amelia; Bellando-Randone, Silvia; Aiello, Vincenzo; Bilia, Silvia; Giannini, Daiana; Ferrari, Tommaso; Caminiti, Rodolfo; Brusi, Veronica; Meliconi, Riccardo; Fallahi, Poupak; Antonelli, Alessandro",Clin Rheumatol,505,5

Prediction models may assist in triaging patients. We aimed to assess the value of several prediction models in COVID-19 patients in the emergency department (ED). METHODS: In this retrospective study, ED patients with COVID-19 were included. Prediction models were selected based on their feasibility. Primary outcome was 30-day mortality, secondary outcomes were 14-day mortality and a composite outcome of 30-day mortality and admission to medium care unit (MCU) or intensive care unit (ICU). The discriminatory performance of the prediction models was assessed using an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: We included 403 patients. Thirty-day mortality was 23.6%, 14-day mortality was 19.1%, 66 patients (16.4%) were admitted to ICU, 48 patients (11.9%) to MCU, and 152 patients (37.7%) met the composite endpoint.

As positive cases continued to rise in Malaysia, public health laboratories experienced an overwhelming demand for COVID-19 screening. The confirmation of positive cases of COVID-19 has solely been based on the detection of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In efforts to increase the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of COVID-19 screening, we evaluated the feasibility of pooling clinical Nasopharyngeal/Oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swab specimens during nucleic acid extraction without a reduction in sensitivity of qRT-PCR. Pools of 10 specimens were extracted and subsequently tested by qRT-PCR according to the WHO-Charité protocol. We demonstrated that the sample pooling method showed no loss of sensitivity. The effectiveness of the pooled testing strategy was evaluated on both retrospective and prospective samples, and the results showed a similar detection sensitivity compared to testing individual sample alone. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using a pooled testing strategy to increase testing capacity and conserve resources, especially when there is a high demand for disease testing.","Lim, Khai Lone; Johari, Nur Alia; Wong, Siew Tung; Khaw, Loke Tim; Tan, Boon Keat; Chan, Kok Keong; Wong, Shew Fung; Chan, Wan Ling Elaine; Ramzi, Nurul Hanis; Lim, Patricia Kim Chooi; Hakim, Sulaiman Lokman; Voon, Kenny",PLoS One,505,24

Early reports proposed that anosmia could be the first or even the only symptom of COVID-19 infection, prompting calls for self-isolation in affected patients. METHODS: In the present article, we review the COVID-19 anosmia literature and try to answer the following two questions: first, why is COVID-19 infection responsible for such a high incidence of anosmia? Second, in patients with more severe forms is anosmia really less prevalent and why? RESULTS: In terms of the etiology of olfactory dysfunction, several hypotheses were proposed at the outset of the pandemic; that olfactory cleft inflammation and obstruction caused a localized conductive loss, that there was injury to the sustentacular supporting cells in the olfactory epithelium or, given the known neurotropic potential of coronavirus, that the virus could invade and damage the olfactory bulb. Olfactory cleft obstruction may contribute to the olfactory dysfunction in some patients, perhaps most likely in those that show very early resolution, it cannot account for the loss in all patients. Moreover, disordered regrowth and a predominance of immature neurons have been shown to be associated with parosmia, which is a common finding amongst patients with Covid-related anosmia. A central mechanism therefore certainly seems to be consistent with the group of patients with more prolonged olfactory deficits. Sustentacular cells showing ACE-2 immunohistochemical expression 200 to 700 times greater than nasal or tracheal epithelia seem to be the main SARS-CoV-2 gateway. As the pathophysiology of COVID-19 anosmia seems to be better understood, the question of why patients with a moderate to severe form of COVID-19 infection have less olfactory involvement remains unresolved. Different potential explanations are discussed in this review. CONCLUSIONS: The last 5 months have benefited from great international collaborative research, first highlighting and then proving the value of loss of smell and taste as a symptom of COVID-19. Adoption of loss of smell into the case definition by international public health bodies will facilitate control of disease transmission.","Saussez, Sven; Lechien, Jerome R; Hopkins, Claire",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,505,21

In arthropods, they are generally viewed as parasites while in nematodes they appear to be mutualists although this demarcation is not absolute. Their presence in arthropods generally leads to reproductive anomalies, while in nematodes, they are generally required for worm development and reproduction. In mosquitos, Wolbachia inhibit RNA viral infections, leading to populational reductions in human RNA virus pathogens, whereas in filarial nematodes, their requirement for worm fertility and survival has been channeled into their use as drug targets for filariasis control. While much more research on these ubiquitous symbionts is needed, they are viewed as playing significant roles in biological processes, ranging from arthropod speciation to human health.","Lefoulon, Emilie; Foster, Jeremy M; Truchon, Alex; Carlow, C K S; Slatko, Barton E",Results Probl Cell Differ,505,22

METHODS: Rapid review, drawing on the World Health Organization's (WHO) methodology for developing interim guidelines during health emergencies. PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central and Campbell Collaboration searched up to mid-April 2020. Searches were supplemented by reference-searching and expert recommendations. Searches were designed to identify: (1) systematic reviews (<10 years), or (2) primary intervention studies (no date limit) reporting evidence on anti-stigma interventions (in relation to COVID-19 or other infectious/stigmatised conditions) or (3) additional relevant materials. Data were extracted on population, intervention, outcome and results. These data were compiled into evidence summary tables and narrative overviews. Recommendations on strategies for COVID-19 stigma-reduction were developed using the WHO 'Evidence to Decision' framework approach. The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (registration ID: CRD42020177677). RESULTS: The searches identified a total of 4150 potentially relevant records, from which 12 systematic reviews and 29 additional articles were included. Overarching considerations and specific recommendations focus on: (1) language/words used in relation to COVID-19 and affected people; (2) media/journalistic practices; (3) public health interventions; (4) targeted public health interventions for key groups and (5) involving communities and key stakeholders. CONCLUSIONS: These recommendations represent the first consolidated evidence-based guidance on stigma and discrimination reduction in relation to COVID-19. Mitigating the impact of stigma is critical in reducing distress and negative experiences, and strengthening communities' resolve to work together during exceptional circumstances. Ultimately, reducing stigma helps addressing structural inequalities that drive marginalisation and exacerbate both health risks and the impact of stigma. Administrations and decision makers are urged to consider integrating these recommendations into the ongoing COVID-19 response.","Gronholm, P C; Nosé, M; van Brakel, W H; Eaton, J; Ebenso, B; Fiekert, K; Milenova, M; Sunkel, C; Barbui, C; Thornicroft, G",Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci,505,24

The Internet Gaming Disorder Scale-Short Form, Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale, and Smartphone Application-Based Addiction Scale were used to assess problematic gaming, social media use, and smartphone use. The Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale-21 was used to assess distress, and an item rated on a 0-10 scale was included to assess fear of being infected by COVID-19. Fear of being infected by COVID-19 was assessed because this could be a confounding variable in the association between psychological distress and screen time use. Increased time spent on gaming, social media, and smartphones was associated with greater problematic gaming, problematic social media use, problematic smartphone use, and psychological distress, but was not associated with fear of COVID-19 infection. Mediation analyses showed that problematic gaming, problematic social media use, and problematic smartphone use were significant mediators in the association between psychological distress and increased time spent on Internet-related activities during the COVID-19 outbreak period. Children who had psychological distress during COVID-19 outbreak might have spent longer time on Internet-related activities due to the school hiatus and problematic use of Internet-related activities.

The present study was conducted to evaluate quality of life (QOL) and perceived financial implications in otorhinolaryngologists during the COVID-19 pandemic across India. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out among otorhinolaryngology specialists across India using WHOQOL-BREF and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Financial Well-Being Scale questionnaires on Google Forms, which was kept open for the latter half of July 2020. Results: A total of 358 responses were obtained; the response rate was 26.64%. Twenty-four percent of respondents worked exclusively in academic settings; 40.22% of specialists had over 10 years of work experience. Average monthly income in 2019 was between 1-3 lakhs Indian Rupees (INR) in 43.85%, while in 2020, 62.57% of the specialists had an average monthly income of below one lakh INR; this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001).

It has been speculated that renin angiotensin system (RAS) blockers may promote COVID-19 by increasing ACE2, which SARS-CoV-2 uses to enter host cells, along with the host protease TMPRSS2. Taking a reverse translational approach and by combining in situ hybridization, primary cell isolation, immunoblotting, qRT-PCR and LC-MS/MS we studied lung and kidney ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in diabetic mice mimicking host factors linked to severe COVID-19. In healthy young mice, neither the ACE inhibitor ramipril nor the AT1 receptor blocker telmisartan affected lung or kidney ACE2 or TMPRSS2, except for a small increase in kidney ACE2 protein with ramipril. In contrast, mice with comorbid diabetes (aging, high fat diet and streptozotocin-induced diabetes) had heightened lung ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein levels and increased lung ACE2 activity. None of these parameters were affected by RAS blockade. ACE2 was similarly upregulated in the kidneys of mice with comorbid diabetes compared to aged controls, whereas TMPRSS2 (primarily distal nephron) was highest in telmisartan-treated animals. Upregulation of lung ACE2 activity in comorbid diabetes may contribute to increased risk of severe COVID-19. This upregulation is driven by comorbidity and not by RAS blockade.","Batchu, Sri Nagarjun; Kaur, Harmandeep; Yerra, Veera Ganesh; Advani, Suzanne L; Kabir, Md Golam; Liu, Youan; Klein, Thomas; Advani, Andrew",Diabetes,505,17

On March 12, a 76-year-old man having a travel history to Saudi Arabia was the first reported fatality in India due to Covid 19. Then for the prevention of the propagation of Covid, the Indian government declared a state of health emergency and strict counter measures were taken, including locking down of cities, prohibiting almost all avoidable activities and restricting population's mobility. From March 24, 2020 due to the complete lockdown in the country, human activities were heavily restricted in the whole geographical regions of India.

To understand the effect of lockdown in PM 2.5 emission in India, which will give us an idea about the background concentration, PDFs (probability density functions) have also been generated for the whole year from 2015 to 2019. The ""goodness-of-fit"" of the probability density functions, to the data, was assessed, using various statistical indices (Chi-square test). Results show that the PM 2.5 reduction during the lockdown period of 2020 as compared to the same period of 2019 is sufficiently large. This study will give a certain degree of idea to the regulatory bodies on planning and implementation of strict air quality control plans.","Mishra, Gaurav; Ghosh, Kunal; Dwivedi, Anubhav Kumar; Kumar, Manish; Kumar, Sidyant; Chintalapati, Sudheer; Tripathi, S N",Sci Total Environ,505,24

A Chinese version of the Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (C-NDDI-E), a self-reporting depression inventory, was applied for rapid detection of major depression. Assessment was carried out online during three different periods (prior to, during, and after the outbreak of COVID-19), with the aim of identifying changes in prevalence of depression and associated risk factors. A total of 158 PWE were recruited into the study (48.7% female). The questionnaire completion rates were 94.3% and 70.9% during and after the outbreak, respectively. The prevalence of depression prior to the epidemic, as the baseline, was 34.8% and increased to 42.3% during the period of the epidemic. Towards the end of the outbreak, the prevalence declined towards the baseline (36.6%). Factors such as living alone (OR = 4.022, 95% CI: 1.158-13.971, P = 0.028) and active seizures before the epidemic (OR = 2.993, 95% CI: 1.197-7.486, P = 0.019) were associated with depression during the epidemic. Monotherapy appeared to be protective against depression (OR = 0. 105, 95% CI: 0.047-0.235, P <0.001). Our results suggest that the pandemic exerts negative influence on PWE's mental health. Depression is one of the common psychological disorders that needs greater attention during this extraordinary period.","Sun, Lingqi; Mo, Qianning; Sun, Hongbin; Niu, Yulong; Si, Yang",Epileptic Disord,505,1

MethodsWe collected data on NPIs, using government notifications and news reports, in six major Indian states from March to August 2020, and we matched these with district-level data on COVID related deaths and Google Mobility reports. We used a district fixed effect regression approach to measure the extent to which district-level lockdowns and mobility restrictions helped reduce deaths in 2020. ResultsIn most states, COVID deaths grew most rapidly only after the initial lockdown was lifted. District-level NPIs were associated with a statistically significantly lower COVID death count in three out of five sample states (district analysis was not possible in Delhi) and in the aggregate. Interventions that were most associated with slowing fatalities were temple closures, retail closures, and curfews. DiscussionOutside of Maharashtra (the first state struck) the first fatality wave appears to have been delayed by the national lockdown. Indias NPIs, however incomplete, were successful in delaying or limiting COVID-19 deaths. Even with incomplete compliance, limiting mass gatherings in face of incipient viral waves may save lives.","Kalra, Aarushi; Novosad, Paul",,505,23

This study aimed to describe the demographic, clinical, and functional status after the discharge of COVID-19 survivors who underwent intensive multidisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation at the Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine Institute of the University of Sao Paulo Medical School General Hospital and Lucy Montoro Rehabilitation Institute. We determined the most important factors related to the length of inpatient rehabilitation treatment and present the functional outcomes. METHODS: This was a retrospective study based on electronic medical records. In addition to the severity of COVID-19 and length of hospital stay for the management of COVID-19 and comorbidities, we collected sociodemographic data including age, sex, height, and weight. Functional assessments were performed using the Functional Independence Measure (FIM); Short Physical Performance Battery; Montreal Cognitive Assessment; Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale; Revised Impact of Events Scale; bioelectrical impedance; Functional Oral Intake Scale; oropharyngeal dysphagia classification; and nutritional assessment. RESULTS: There was a significant improvement in FIM before and after inpatient rehabilitation treatment (p&lt;0.0001). Muscle strength and walking capacity were significantly improved (p&lt;0.01). The most important factors related to the length of inpatient rehabilitation treatment were improvement in FIM scores (Spearman's r=0.71) and gain in lean mass (Spearman's r=0.79). CONCLUSIONS: Rehabilitation of patients after COVID-19 recovery improves their functional status and should be considered in the post-acute phase for selected patients with COVID-19.","Imamura, Marta; Mirisola, Aline Rossetti; Ribeiro, Fernando de Quadros; De Pretto, Lucas Ramos; Alfieri, Fábio Marcon; Delgado, Vinicius Ramos; Battistella, Linamara Rizzo",Clinics,505,1

The COVID-19 rapidly spread across the nations with high mortality rate even as very little is known to contain the virus at present. In the current study, we report novel natural metabolites namely, ursolic acid, carvacrol and oleanolic acid as the potential inhibitors against main protease (Mpro) of COVID-19 by using integrated molecular modeling approaches. From a combination of molecular docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, we found three ligands bound to protease during 50 ns of MD simulations. Furthermore, the molecular mechanic/generalized/Born/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/G/P/BSA) free energy calculations showed that these chemical molecules have stable and favourable energies causing strong binding with binding site of Mpro protein. All these three molecules, namely, ursolic acid, carvacrol and oleanolic acid, have passed the ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion) property as well as Lipinski's rule of five. The study provides a basic foundation and suggests that the three phytochemicals, viz. ursolic acid, carvacrol and oleanolic acid could serve as potential inhibitors in regulating the Mpro protein's function and controlling viral replication.

In this unprecedented situation, the intimate relationship, sexual behavior, and family functions of partners have also undergone unique changes. There are few reports on whether sexual behavior and family function affect intimate relationships between partners, especially among people aged 18 to 44 years. AIM: To analyze the influence of sociodemographic characteristics, family function, and changes in sexual behavior on male-female intimacy, the independent contributions of the aforementioned factors in this population group are required to be further investigated. METHODS: In the present study, 284 Chinese citizens aged 18-44 years completed the online questionnaire. The univariate analysis and cluster multiple linear regression were used to analyze the associations between sociodemographic factors, sexual-behavior changes, family function, and male-female intimacy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Family adaptation, partnership, growth, affection, resolve (APGAR) Scale and Relationship Assessment Scale were used to evaluate participants' family function and their intimacy. Details of the participants (sociodemographic and sexual factors) were obtained. RESULTS: The summary scores, with Relationship Assessment Scale and APGAR scales, were 27.19 ± 4.49 and 6.76 ± 2.28, respectively. About 43.3% of participants reported a decrease in sexual frequency. There were considerable differences among age, education level, sexual desire, sexual satisfaction, quality of sexual life, family function with male-female intimacy (P < .05). The sexual satisfaction and intimacy demonstrated a significant positive correlation (P < .05) by cluster multiple linear regression analysis. Compared with those who had a sexual life of mediocre quality, respondents who experienced a good quality sexual life had relatively higher scores in intimacy. The independent contributions of sociodemographic factors, sexual behavior factors, and family function in male-female intimacy were 13.0%, 38.2%, and 48.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Sexual behavior factors and family function were important independent determinants of partner intimacy among people aged 18-44 years. It can provide supportive information for health care to develop intervention plans and services to promote the harmonious development of intimate relationship. Y-J Feng, Y-J Fan, Z-Z Su, et al.

Methodologically, we introduced TPL (Taylor power law) to characterize their spatiotemporal heterogeneity/stability and Hubbell (2001) unified neutral theory of biodiversity (UNTB) [specifically Harris et al. (2015) HDP-MSN model (hierarchical Dirichlet process multi-site neutral model)] to approximate the metapopulation of coronavirus infections. First, TPL analysis suggested that the coronaviruses appear to have a specific heterogeneity/stability scaling parameter (TPL-b) slightly exceeding 2 for cumulative infections or exceeding 1 for daily incremental infections, suggesting their potentially chaotic, unstable outbreaks. Another TPL parameter (M0) (i.e., infection critical threshold) depends on virus kinds (COVID-19/SARS), time (disease-stages), space (regions) and public-health interventions (e.g., quarantines and mobility control). M0 measures the infection level, at which infections are random (Poisson distribution) and below which infections follow uniform distribution and may die off if M0 coincides or below the level of Allee effects. It was found that COVID-19 outbreak seems nearly twice more risky than SARS, and the lower infection threshold may be due to its lower lethality than SARS since lower fatality rates can facilitate the survival and spread of pathogen. Second, metacommunity UNTB neutrality testing seems appropriate for approximating metapopulation of coronavirus infections. Specifically, two parameters {\theta} and M, borrowed from neutral theory, may be used to assess the relative significance of infection through local contagion vs. infection through migration, both of which may depend on time, space, virus kinds, and particularly public-health interventions.","Ma, Zhanshan",,505,32

Epidemiological parameters such as contagiousness (virus transmission rate), initial number of infected people, and probability of being tested depend on the region's demographic and geographical features, the containment measures introduced; they are calibrated to data about COVID-19 spread in the region of interest. At the first stage of our study, epidemiological data (numbers of people tested, diagnoses, critical cases, hospitalizations, and deaths) for each of the mentioned regions were analyzed. The data were characterized in terms of seasonality, stationarity, and dependency spaces, and were extrapolated using machine learning techniques to specify unknown epidemiological parameters of the model. At the second stage, the Optuna optimizer based on the tree Parzen estimation method for objective function minimization was applied to determine the model's unknown parameters. The model was validated with the historical data of 2020. The modeled results of COVID-19 spread in New York State, the UK and the Novosibirsk region have demonstrated that if the level of testing and containment measures is preserved, the number of positive cases in New York State and the Novosibirsk region will remain the same during March of 2021, while in the UK it will reduce. Due to the features of the data for the Novosibirsk region (two datasets are characterized as stationary series with probability of 1), the forecast precision is relatively high for the number of hospitalizations, but is lower for new cases of COVID-19.","Krivorotko, Olga; Sosnovskaia, Mariia; Vashchenko, Ivan; Kerr, Cliff; Lesnic, Daniel",,505,16

Therefore, this meta-analysis endeavors to present collective evidence discussing the psychological impact of COVID-19 among college students. Bibliographical library databases, including Embase, Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, and PsycINFO, were systematically searched for relevant studies. Titles, abstracts, and full articles were screened, and two reviewers extracted data. Heterogeneity was assessed by I2 statistic. The random-effects model was utilized to obtain the pooled estimates of psychological indicators among college students. Location, gender, level of severity, and quality scores were used as moderator variables for subgroup analyses. Funnel plot and Egger linear regression test was used to assess publication bias. Twenty-seven studies constituting 90,879 college students met the inclusion criteria.

The most frequent complaint related to the COVID-19 vaccination was the fear of side effects. Within the Spanish and European legislative framework, both compulsory vaccination and government regulation of FN (Fake News) appear to be feasible options, counting on sufficient legal support, which could be reinforced by additional amendment. However, following current trends of good governance, policymakers must have public legitimation. Rather than compulsory COVID-19 vaccination, an approach based on education and truthful information, persuading the population of the benefits of a vaccine on a voluntary basis, is recommended. Disagreements between health professionals are positive, but they should be resolved following good practice and the procedures of the code of ethics. Furthermore, citizens do not support the involvement of government authorities in the direct control of news. Collaboration with the media and other organizations should be used instead.","Marco-Franco, Julio Emilio; Pita-Barros, Pedro; Vivas-Orts, David; González-de-Julián, Silvia; Vivas-Consuelo, David",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),505,12

However, no systematic evaluation of these policies in their alleviation of the pandemic has been done. We investigate the impact of five indices derived from 12 policies in the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker dataset and the Korean government's index, which is the social distancing level implemented by the Korean government in response to the changing pandemic situation. We employed segmented Poisson model for this analysis. In conclusion, health and the Korean government indices are most consistently effective (with negative coefficients), while the restriction and stringency indexes are mainly effective with lagging (1~10 days), as intuitively daily confirmed cases of a given day is affected by the policies implemented days before, which shows that a period of time is required before the impact of some policies can be observed. The health index demonstrates the importance of public information campaign, testing policy and contact tracing, while the government index shows the importance of social distancing guidelines in mitigating the spread of the virus. These results imply the important roles of these polices in mitigation of the spread of COVID-19 disease.","Heo, Gyujin; Apio, Catherine; Han, Kyulhee; Goo, Taewan; Chung, Hye Won; Kim, Taehyun; Kim, Hakyong; Ko, Yeonghyeon; Lee, Doeun; Lim, Jisun; Park, Taesung",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),505,13

The study of therapeutic itineraries (TI) for treatment of snakebites would support strategies to provide timely access to users. A TI is the set of processes by which individuals adhere to certain forms of treatment, and includes the path traveled in the search for healthcare, and practices to solve their health problems. This study aims to describe TIs of snakebite patients in the Brazilian Amazon. This study was carried out at the Fundação de Medicina Tropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado, in Manaus, state of Amazonas, Brazil. The itinerary from the moment of the bite to the patient’s admission to the reference unit was analyzed. Sample size was defined by saturation. After an exploratory survey to collect epidemiological variables, in-depth interviews were conducted following a semi-structured guide. Patients originated from rural areas of 11 different municipalities, including ones located &gt;500 kilometers from Manaus. A great fragmentation was observed in the itineraries, marked by several changes of means of transport along the route. Four themes emerged from the analysis: exposure to snakebite during day-to-day activities, use of traditional therapeutic practices, and personal perception of the severity, as well as the route taken and its contingencies. Access to healthcare requires considerable effort on the part of snakebite patients. Major barriers were identified, such as the low number of hospitals that offer antivenom treatment, poor access to healthcare due to long distances and geographic barriers, low acceptability of healthcare offered in countryside, lack of use of personal protective equipment, common use of ineffective or deleterious self-care practices, late recognition of serious clinical signs and resistance to seeking medical assistance. Health education, promotion of immediate transport to health centers and decentralization of antivenom from reference hospitals to community healthcare centers in the Brazilian Amazon are more effective strategies that would to maximize access to antivenom treatment.","Cristino, Joseir Saturnino; Salazar, Guilherme Maciel; Machado, Vinícius Azevedo; Honorato, Eduardo; Farias, Altair Seabra; Vissoci, João Ricardo Nickenig; Silva Neto, Alexandre Vilhena; Lacerda, Marcus; Fan, Hui Wen; Monteiro, Wuelton Marcelo; Sachett, Jacqueline Almeida Gonçalves",Plos Negl.

The recent coronavirus pandemic created urgent demand to deal with the problem using nonconventional venues such as telehealth and teledentistry. This study aimed to investigate teledentistry knowledge, attitudes, and practices, and barriers to its use among dental students and teaching staff in Makkah province, Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods: A total of 314 dental students participated in this cross-sectional study. Data were collected using a validated self-reported questionnaire to measure teledentistry awareness, attitude, practices, and barriers to teledentistry. The study was approved by Umm Al-Qura University, Saudi Arabia. Results: Only 17.2% were aware of the term 'teledentistry.' However, after it was explained, participants were able to correctly answer 25.16%-62.42% of items about teledentistry. A total of 67.83% would practice teledentistry, and 70.7% support using teledentistry on a national scale for Vision 2030. Only 25.16% used teledentistry before, but 56.05% did dental consultations via smartphone. The most common barriers were patient satisfaction requiring a dentist's physical presence, violation of patient privacy, and low levels of population education.

Initially, the binding site of COVID-19 main protease was predicted which located between regions 2 and 3. Structure-based virtual screening was performed through a hierarchal mode of elimination technique after generating a grid box. This led to the identification of five top hit molecules that were selected on the basis of docking score and visualization of non-bonding interactions. The docking results revealed that the hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions are the major contributing factors in the stabilization of complexes. The docking scores were found between -7.524 and -6.711 kcal/mol indicating strong ligand-protein interactions. Amino acid residues Phe140, Leu141, Gly143, Asn142, Thr26, Glu166 and Thr190 (hydrogen bonding interactions) and Phe140, Cys145, Cys44, Met49, Leu167, Pro168, Met165, Val42, Leu27 and Ala191 (hydrophobic interactions) formed the binding pocket of COVID-19 main protease. From identified hits, ZINC13144609 and ZINC01581128 were selected for atomistic MD simulation and density functional theory calculations. MD simulation results confirm that the protein interacting with both hit molecules is stabilized in the chosen POPC lipid bilayer membrane. The presence of lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) in the hydrophobic region of the hit molecules leads to favorable ligand-protein contacts. The calculated pharmacokinetic descriptors were found to be in their acceptable range and therefore confirming their drug-like properties. Hence, the present investigation can serve as the basis for designing and developing COVID-19 inhibitors. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Although several genes are responsible for resistant starch (RS) and slowly digestible starch (SDS), gaps persist concerning the molecular basis of RS and SDS formation due to the complex genetic mechanisms of starch digestibility. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to identify new genes for starch digestibility in rice and interprete the genetic mechanisms of RS and SDS by GWAS. METHODS: Genome-wide association studies were conducted by associating the RS and SDS phenotypes of 104 re-sequenced rice lines to an SNP dataset of 2,288,867 sites using a compressed mixed linear model. Candidate genes were identified according to the position of the SNPs based on data from the MSU Rice Genome Annotation Project. RESULTS: Seven quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were detected to be associated with the RS content, among which the SNP 6 m1765761 was located on Waxy. Starch branching enzymes IIa (BEIIa) close to QTL qRS-I4 was detected and further identified as a specific candidate gene for RS in INDICA. Two QTLs were associated with SDS, and the LOC_Os09g09360 encoding lipase was identified as a causal gene for SDS. CONCLUSIONS: GWAS is a valid strategy to genetically dissect the formation of starch digestion properties in rice. RS formation in grains is dependent on the rice type; lipid might also contribute to starch digestibility and should be an alternative factor to improve rice starch digestibility.","Zhang, Ning; Wang, Maike; Fu, Ji; Shen, Yi; Ding, Yi; Wu, Dianxing; Shu, Xiaoli; Song, Wenjian",Genes &amp; genomics (Online),505,31

This study estimates excess all-cause, pneumonia and influenza mortality during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic using the 11 September 2020 release of weekly mortality data from the United States (U.S.) Mortality Surveillance System (MSS) from 27 September 2015 to 9 May 2020, using semiparametric and conventional time-series models in 13 states with high reported COVID-19 deaths and apparently complete mortality data: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington. We estimated greater excess mortality than official COVID-19 mortality in the U.S. (excess mortality 95% confidence interval (CI) 100 013-127 501 vs. 78 834 COVID-19 deaths) and 9 states: California (excess mortality 95% CI 3338-6344) vs. 2849 COVID-19 deaths); Connecticut (excess mortality 95% CI 3095-3952) vs. 2932 COVID-19 deaths); Illinois (95% CI 4646-6111) vs. 3525 COVID-19 deaths); Louisiana (excess mortality 95% CI 2341-3183 vs. 2267 COVID-19 deaths); Massachusetts (95% CI 5562-7201 vs. 5050 COVID-19 deaths); New Jersey (95% CI 13 170-16 058 vs. 10 465 COVID-19 deaths); New York (95% CI 32 538-39 960 vs. 26 584 COVID-19 deaths); and Pennsylvania (95% CI 5125-6560 vs. 3793 COVID-19 deaths). Conventional model results were consistent with semiparametric results but less precise. Significant excess pneumonia deaths were also found for all locations and we estimated hundreds of excess influenza deaths in New York. We find that official COVID-19 mortality substantially understates actual mortality, excess deaths cannot be explained entirely by official COVID-19 death counts. Mortality reporting lags appeared to worsen during the pandemic, when timeliness in surveillance systems was most crucial for improving pandemic response.","Rivera, R; Rosenbaum, J E; Quispe, W",Epidemiol Infect,505,1

The association with severe radiological pulmonary changes, prophylactic anticoagulation and ICU care was assessed. METHODS: From 1 March until 31 May 2020, all in-hospital patients with a positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2-RNA and PE diagnosed with computed tomography pulmonary angiography were identified through diagnostic codes in medical charts. PE was characterised as central/peripheral and unilateral/bilateral. Covid-19 related lung changes were evaluated scoring the proportion of affected lung (max-score score 25) for all five lobes in both lungs. ICU and non-ICU patients were included and anticoagulant regimens were assessed. RESULTS: Of 1162 patients with Covid-19, 41 were diagnosed with PE (cumulative incidence 3.5%), and of these 63.4% (=overall 2.2%) had central PE. PE on admission was present in 46.3%. No differences were seen in the distribution of central vs. peripheral PE in relation to prophylactic anticoagulation (p=.317). Of ICU patients 82.4% were diagnosed with central PE compared to 50.0% among non-ICU patients (p=.05). No association was observed between the presence of central PE and the extent of radiological Covid-19 changes (p=.451). Mild (0-12 p) and severe (13-25 p) pulmonary changes were seen in 63.4% and 36.6% of patients respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, and especially in ICU-patients, a high proportion of central PE was seen and many were diagnosed at admission. No association between central PE and prophylactic anticoagulation, or the extent of pulmonary Covid-19 changes was observed.","Nordberg, Martin; Bankler, Sara; Everhov, Åsa H; Saraste, Deborah",Infect Dis (Lond),505,20

In type 2 diabetes, there is a change in immune system cells, which shift from an anti-inflammatory to a predominantly pro-inflammatory pattern. This altered immune profile may induce important clinical consequences, including increased susceptibility to lung infections; and enhanced local inflammatory response. Furthermore, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) enzyme is highly expressed in the lung, and that it may have additional actions besides its effects on glucose metabolism, which might exert profound pro-inflammatory effects. We briefly review the impact on the inflammatory system of DPP4 for its possible detrimental effect on COVID-19 syndrome, and of DPP4 inhibitors (gliptins), currently used as glucose lowering agents, which may have the potential to exert positive pleiotropic effect on inflammatory diseases, in addition to their effects on glucose metabolism. Thanks to these ancillary effects, gliptins could potentially be ""repurposed"" as salutary drugs against COVID-19 syndrome, even in non-diabetic subjects. Clinical studies should be designed to investigate this possibility.","Pantanetti, Paola; Cangelosi, Giovanni; Ambrosio, Giuseppe",Intern. emerg. med,505,32

This disruption in individuals' daily routines transformed food consumption habits. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on food consumption, diet and food shopping behaviors in Lebanon. Design/methodology/approach: The paper draws upon an online survey in Lebanon administered in Arabic and English through the Survey Monkey platform in the period of July 15—August 5, 2020, with 201 adults. The survey findings were analyzed using descriptive statistics, a paired sample t-test and a Phi correlation test. Findings: The research underlined numerous key consumer tendencies that are currently affecting diet and food behavior in Lebanon. Indeed, the study outcomes suggested (1) a move toward healthier diets;(2) a rise in the consumption of domestic products due to food safety concerns;(3) a change in the grocery shopping behaviors (with a rise in online shopping);(4) a surge of food stockpiling;and (5) a decrease in household food wastage. Surprisingly, COVID-19 seems to generate several positive changes toward more sustainable and healthier consumption patterns in Lebanon. Research limitations/implications: These findings contribute to the clarification and critical analysis of the impacts of COVID-19 on food behaviors in Lebanon, which would have several policy implications.

In case of the unavailability of soap and water, ""instant"" hand sanitizers are recommended because their application can be considered easy, versatile, quick and often less aggressive for the skin. For these reasons, alcoholic and alcohol-free hand rub gels can be considered the best performing formulations on the market. Together with disinfectants and antiseptic agents, hydrogels play a fundamental role in obtaining stable formulations and are easy to disperse, with a pleasant skin feel and an overall good performance. Several compounds commonly used in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industry are available for this purpose, in particular, cellulose derivatives and synthetic polymers derivatives. Each of them is available in several grades, presenting different thickening behavior, rheological properties and compatibility with other ingredients, alcohols in particular. For all these reasons, it is important to explore hydrogel properties and behaviors in different contexts (i.e., hydroalcoholic and aqueous media) in order to develop new and performing hand rub gels, always taking into account the different international legal frameworks regarding disinfectant and sanitizing formulations.","Villa, Carla; Russo, Eleonora",,505,3

Methods To resume our endoscopic activity after the first wave of C19 infection, a protection protocol depending on C19reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result and clinical triage before endoscopy was established. Twoprotection levels were defined: Low (negative PCR and triage), requiring basic protection (hat, gloves, permeable coat, surgical mask in lower and fpp2 in upper endoscopy);and high (positive PCR or symptoms), requiring advanced protection(hat, ocular protection, fpp2 mask, gloves and waterpro of coat). Non urgent endoscopies where cancelled if PCR waspositive. A prospective research evaluating the efficacy of this protocol was completed from april 27th to june 24th. Patientswhere contacted 2 weeks later to exclude a possible C19 infection. Results 2304 patients, 46.1 % women, were included with mean age of 59.88 ±15,547. 987 gastroscopies, 1084colonoscopies, 113 ERCP, 101 ecoendoscopies, 9 enteroscopies and 173 rectosigmoidoscopies were performed. PreviousPCR was made to 2302 patients and was positive in 10 (7 endoscopies were cancelled). We classiffied 2291 (99.7 %)patients as low risk and 13 as high. The PE used by the endoscopist was considered appropriate in 42.2 %, excessive in 41 % and insufficient in 16.7 % according to the protection protocol. This was influenced by the endoscopist (p &lt; 0,01) and thetype of endoscopy: in 43.1 % of the colonoscopies the PE was excessive (p &lt; 0,001). None of the endoscopists were infectedby C19 during the research period. We contacted 1744 patients (75.9 %) with no suspicion of C19 in any.

A rapid description based on the NIR technology is implemented to assess black tea tenderness and rankings. First, 700 standard samples from dianhong black tea of seven quality classes are scanned using a NIR system. The raw spectra acquired are preprocessed by Savitzky-Golay (SG) filtering coupled with standard normal variate transformation (SNV). Then, the multi-variable selection algorithm (IGA-PSO) is applied to compare with the single method (the IGA and PSO) and search the optimal characteristic wavelengths. Finally, the identification models are developed using a decision tree (DT), partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and support vector machine (SVM) based on different kernel functions combined with the effective features from the above variables screening paths for the discrimination of black tea quality. The results show that the IGA-PSO-SVM model with a radial basis function achieves the best predictive results with the correct discriminant rate (CDR) of 95.28% based on selected four characteristic variables in the prediction process. The overall results demonstrate that NIR combined with a multi-variable selection method can constitute a potential tool to understand the most important features involved in the evaluation of dianhong black tea quality helping the instrument manufacturers to achieve the development of low-cost and handheld NIR sensors.","Ren, Guangxin; Ning, Jingming; Zhang, Zhengzhu",Spectrochim Acta A Mol Biomol Spectrosc,505,22

We describe a case of COVID-19 with hemorrhagic complication in the post-acute phase of the disease. The patient was a 93-year-old woman admitted to a post-acute care unit for COVID-19 patients in northern Italy. The patient's medical history included moderate cognitive impairment, atrial fibrillation under oral anticoagulation (warfarin 2.5 mg and 3.75 mg on alternate days, showing stable PT-INR values since October 2018), and arterial hypertension. The patient was affected by COVID-19, treated with supportive therapy. In the post-acute phase of the disease, the patient presented with melena and showed a marked elevation of PT-INR of 25.1. She was treated with venous infusion of three-factor prothrombin complex concentrate and vitamin K until PT-INR reduction. After 5 days, blood analyses revealed normal hemoglobin, PT-INR 2.15, and a slight alteration of liver function. This case supports a strong impact of the infection on the coagulative pattern not only pro-thrombotically but also by increasing hemorrhagic risk. Special attention should therefore be paid to COVID-19 patients under anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonist and a shift to heparin treatment until illness resolution may be a safe option in these individuals.","Trevisan, Caterina; Miconi, Lorella; Barbierato, Emanuele; Marinaro, Giuseppe; Targhetta, Stefano; D039,; agata, Mario; Rinaldi, Daniela",SN Compr Clin Med,505,16

Most individuals are asymptomatic or display mild symptoms, which raises an inherent question as to how does the immune response differs from patients manifesting severe disease? During the initial phase of infection, dysregulated effector immune cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, monocytes, megakaryocytes, basophils, eosinophils, erythroid progenitor cells, and Th17 cells can alter the trajectory of an infected patient to severe disease. On the other hand, properly functioning CD4+, CD8+ cells, NK cells, and DCs reduce the disease severity. Detailed understanding of the immune response of convalescent individuals transitioning from the effector phase to the immunogenic memory phase can provide vital clues to understanding essential variables to assess vaccine-induced protection. Although neutralizing antibodies can wane over time, long-lasting B and T memory cells can persist in recovered individuals. The natural immunological memory captures the diverse repertoire of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes after natural infection whereas, currently approved vaccines are based on a single epitope, spike protein. It is essential to understand the nature of the immune response to natural infection to better identify 'correlates of protection' against this disease. This article discusses recent findings regarding immune response against natural infection to SARS-CoV-2 and the nature of immunogenic memory. More precise knowledge of the acute phase of immune response and its transition to immunological memory will contribute to the future design of vaccines and the identification of variables essential to maintain immune protection across diverse populations.","Ahluwalia, Pankaj; Vaibhav, Kumar; Ahluwalia, Meenakshi; Mondal, Ashis K; Sahajpal, Nikhil; Rojiani, Amyn M; Kolhe, Ravindra",Front Immunol,505,15

Considering the gravity of its impact there is an immediate need to develop a detection technique that is sensitive, specific, fast, and affordable for the clinical diagnosis of the disease. Real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)-based detection platforms are contemplated to be the gold standard to detect viral RNA. However, that may be susceptible to errors, and there is a risk of obtaining false results, which ultimately compromises the strategy of efficient disease management. Several modern techniques exhibiting assured results with enhanced sensitivity and specificity against the SARS-CoV-2 associated viral components or immune response against it have been developed and may be implemented. The review deals with the conventional RT-PCR detection techniques and compares them to other detection platforms viz., biosensor based detection of antigens, fluorescent or colorimetric detection systems including CRISPR-Cas 13 based SHERLOCK kit, CRISPR Cas-9 based FELUDA test kit, CRISPR DETECTR kit, Next Generation Sequencing or microarray-based kits. These modern techniques are great as a point of care detection methods but should be followed by RT PCR based detection for the confirmation of COVID-19 status.","Das Mukhopadhyay, Chitrangada; Sharma, Pramita; Sinha, Koel; Rajarshi, Keshav",Biophys Chem,505,24

Cross-sectional studies have provided variable rates of seroprevalence in HCWs. Longitudinal assessments of the serological response to Covid-19 among HCWs are crucial to understanding the risk of infection and changes in antibody titers over time. We aimed to investigate seroprevalence and risk factors associated with seroconversion in a prospective cohort of HCWs during the peak of the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal study among 446 front-line HCWsin a tertiary-care hospital in Chile from April to July 2020. IgG was determined monthly using two different ELISAs in serum samples of HCWs, during the three-month period. In each visit, demographic data, symptoms, risk factors, and exposure risks were also assessed. RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence at the end of the study period was 24% (95% CI20.2-28.3), with 43% of seropositive HCWs reporting no prior symptoms. Seroconversion rates significantly differed over the study period, from 2.1% to as high as 8.8% at the peak of the epidemic. There were no statistically significant differences observed between HCWs in direct clinical care of patients with Covid-19 and those working in low risk areas. Antibody titers appeared to wane over time. CONCLUSIONS: HCWs were severely affected with a high rate of seroconversion that appeared to mirror the local epidemiological situation. A significant amount of participants underwent an asymptomatic infection, highlighting the need for improved surveillance policies. Antibody titers appear to wane over time; further studies to understand this finding's impact on the risk of reinfection are warranted.","Iruretagoyena, Mirentxu; Vial, Macarena R; Spencer-Sandino, Maria; Gaete, Pablo; Peters, Anne; Delgado, Iris; Perez, Inia; Calderon, Claudia; Porte, Lorena; Legarraga, Paulette; Anderson, Alicia; Aguilera, Ximena; Vial, Pablo; Weitzel, Thomas; Munita, Jose M",BMC Infect Dis,505,23

Mainly based on results obtained by autopsies, the seminal features of fatal COVID-19 have been described by many groups worldwide. Early changes encompass edema, epithelial damage, and capillaritis/endothelialitis, frequently combined with microthrombosis. Subsequently, patients with manifest respiratory insufficiency exhibit exudative diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with hyaline membrane formation and pneumocyte type 2 hyperplasia, variably complicated by superinfection, which may progress to organizing/fibrotic stage DAD.

Rats were assigned to five equal groups; Control, CoQ10 (10 mg/kg, orally), PM (7 mg/kg, i.p.), CoQ + PM L, and CoQ + PM H group. After 28 days, PM provoked severe gastric ulceration and marked liver and kidney damage indicated by an elevated gastric ulcer index and considerable alteration in liver and kidney biochemical tests. The toxic effects might be attributed to mitochondrial dysfunction and excess generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as indicated by enhanced malondialdehyde (MDA) levels along with decreased reduced-glutathione (GSH) levels and catalase (CAT) activity. Apoptotic cell death also was demonstrated by increased regulation of activated caspase-3 in the stomach, liver, and kidney tissues. Interestingly, external supplementation of CoQ10 attenuated the PM-inflicted deleterious oxidative harm and apoptosis.

Knowledge about the clinical profile, imaging findings, and outcomes is still evolving. Here we describe the characteristics of a cohort of 62 COVID-19-related stroke patients from 13 hospitals, from Bangalore city, south India. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical profile, neuroimaging findings, interventions, and outcomes in COVID-19-related stroke patients. METHODS: This is a multicenter retrospective study of all COVID-19-related stroke patients from 13 hospitals from south India; 1st June 2020-31st August 2020. The demographic, clinical, laboratory, and neuroimaging data were collected along with treatment administered and outcomes. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in all cases by RT-PCR testing. The data obtained from the case records were entered in SPSS 25 for statistical analysis. RESULTS: During the three-month period, we had 62 COVID-19-related stroke patients, across 13 centers; 60 (97%) had ischemic strokes, while 2 (3%) had hemorrhagic strokes. The mean age of patients was 55.66 ± 13.20 years, with 34 (77.4%) males. Twenty-six percent (16/62) of patients did not have any conventional risk factors for stroke. Diabetes mellitus was seen in 54.8%, hypertension was present in 61.3%, coronary artery disease in 8%, and atrial fibrillation in 4.8%. Baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 12.7 ± 6.44. Stroke severity was moderate (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 5-15) in 27 (61.3%) patients, moderate to severe (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 16-20) in 13 (20.9%) patients and severe (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 21-42) in 11 (17.7%) patients. According to TOAST classification, 48.3% was stroke of undetermined etiology, 36.6% had large artery atherosclerosis, 10% had small vessel occlusion, and 5% had cardioembolic strokes. Three (5%) received intravenous thrombolysis with tenecteplase 0.2 mg/kg and 3 (5%) underwent mechanical thrombectomy, two endovascular and one surgical. Duration of hospital stay was 16.16 ± 6.39 days; 21% (13/62) died in hospital, while 37 (59.7%) had a modified Rankin score of 3-5 at discharge. Hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and higher baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores were associated with increased mortality. A comparison to 111 historical controls during the non-COVID period showed a higher proportion of strokes of undetermined etiology, higher mortality, and higher morbidity in COVID-19-related stroke patients. CONCLUSION: COVID-19-related strokes are increasingly being recognized in developing countries, like India. Stroke of undetermined etiology appears to be the most common TOAST subtype of COVID-19-related strokes. COVID-19-related strokes were more severe in nature and resulted in higher mortality and morbidity. Hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and higher baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores were associated with increased mortality.","Mathew, Thomas; John, Saji K; Sarma, Grk; Nadig, Raghunandan; Kumar R, Shiva; Murgod, Uday; Mahadevappa, Manjunath; Javali, Mahendra; Acharya, Purushottam Thammaya; Hosurkar, Guruprasad; Krishnan, Pramod; Kamath, Vikram; Badachi, Sagar; Souza, Delon D; Iyer, Rajesh B; Nagarajaiah, Rajesh Karalumangala; Anand, Bawani; Kumar, Sujit; Kodapala, Suresh; Shivde, Sonia; Avati, Amrutha; Baddala, Rohit; Potharlanka, Prasanth Babu; Pavuluri, Sravanthi; Varidireddy, Abhinaya; Awatare, Poonam; Shobha, Nandavar; Renukaradhya, Umashankar; Kumar, S Praveen; Ramachandran, Jayachandran; Arumugam, Ramesh; Deepalam, Saikanth; Kumar, Sharath; Huded, Vikram",Int J Stroke,505,1

A growing body of literature recognizes the importance of building a rural ecological livability (REL) system. It is urgent that we clarify the status quo and spatial-temporal differences in and distributional characteristics of rural ecological livability and that we carry out targeted and differentiated construction to promote rural ecological livability in post-epidemic China. This study proposes a conceptual model that incorporates various economic, social and environmental factors and develops a comprehensive multifactor (production-living-ecology) evaluation system. Using Fujian Province as an example, the entropy weight method is used to measure the REL level of 55 counties and cities, which are comprehensively evaluated from 2015 to 2019. Moran's I and Getis-Ord Gi* are used to analyze the spatial and distributional characteristics of the REL level in Fujian. The results show that the level of REL in Fujian Province has been relatively flat over the past five years, with a slight downward trend. The overall value of the rural ecological livability index in 2015 was 0.345, and its overall value in 2019 was 0.334, with an average value of 0.343. The REL of Fujian Province is spatially correlated, with high levels of livability in the southeast and low levels in the northeast. The autocorrelation in the level of ecological livability in Fujian's counties and cities continues to increase.","Jiang, Xiaoli; Wang, Lingyu; Su, Xiaofeng; Zeng, Weipeng; Xu, Anxin; Zheng, Qiujin; Xu, Wenxing",PLoS One,505,15

METHODS: Observational study was conducted at a tertiary hospital in Amman, Jordan. Demographic data, clinical presentation and smoking status were collected. Sinonasal symptoms, using Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) Questionnaire, were evaluated. Smell/taste dysfunction was followed for three months. RESULTS: Ninety-Seven patients had satisfactory responses. Eighty-six patients were symptomatic (41 at presentation, and 45 during admission). Among those patients, 59.3% had cough, 52.3% sore throat and 48.8% fever. The most common initial symptom was sore throat. Shortness of breath and smell/taste dysfunction were significantly higher in females. Surprisingly, shortness of breath was more common in non-smokers. Smell/taste dysfunction affected 25.6% of patients, but was the first symptom in only one patient. Fourteen of 22 symptoms in SNOT-22 had significant increase. The overall average of symptoms scores increased from 0.472 to 1.034, with smell/taste dysfunction to have the most increment. The latter symptom recovered completely in 81% and dysgeusia developed in 9.5% at three months, and it recovered completely in all patients at six months. CONCLUSION: Although COVID-19 may produce severe lower airways disease, it has modest effect on nose and paranasal sinuses. Moreover, smell/taste dysfunction is a prominent symptom, but it usually recovers dramatically.","Tarifi, Amjed; Al Shdaifat, Amjad A; Al-Shudifat, Abdel-Ellah M; Azab, Mohammed; Ismail, Ja039; far,; Bashir, Rand; Amro, Aous; Altarifi, Ahmad; Khader, Yousef",Int J Clin Pract,505,8

Currently there is no accepted chemoprophylaxis but hydroxychloroquine (HDQ) is known to inhibit the coronavirus in vitro. Our hypothesis is that oral administration of hydroxychloroquine to healthcare professionals can reduce the incidence and prevalence of infection as well as its severity in this group. METHODS: Design: Prospective, single center, double blind, randomised, controlled trial (RCT). PARTICIPANTS: Adult health-care professionals (18-65 years) working in areas of high exposure and high risk of transmission of SARS-COV-2 (COVID areas, Intensive Care Unit -ICUs-, Emergency, Anesthesia and all those performing aerosol-generating procedures) will be included. Exclusion criteria include previous infection with SARS CoV2 (positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or IgG serology), pregnancy or lactation, any contraindication to hydroxychloroquine or evidence of unstable or clinically significant systemic disease. INTERVENTIONS: Patients will be randomized (1:1) to receive once-daily oral Hydroxychloroquine 200mg for two months (HC group) or placebo (P group) in addition to the protective measures appropriate to the level of exposure established by the hospital. A serological evaluation will be carried out every 15 days with PCR in case of seroconversion, symptoms or risk exposure. Primary outcome is the percentage of subjects presenting infection (seroconversion and/or PCR +ve) by the SARS-Cov-2 virus during the observation period. Additionally, both the percentage of subjects in each group presenting Pneumonia with severity criteria (Curb 65 &#8805;2) and that of subjects requiring admission to ICU will be determined. DISCUSSION: While awaiting a vaccine, hygiene measures, social distancing and personal protective equipment are the only primary prophylaxis measures against SARS-CoV-2, but they have not been sufficient to protect our healthcare professionals. Some evidence of the in vitro efficacy of hydroxychloroquine against this virus is known, along with some clinical data that would support the study of this drug in the chemoprophylaxis of infection. However, there are still no data from controlled clinical trials in this regard. If our hypothesis is confirmed, hydroxychloroquine can help professionals fight this infection with more guarantees. PARTICIPANTS: This is a single-center study that will be carried out at the Marqués de Valdecilla University Hospital. 450 health professionals working at the Hospital Universitario Marqués de Valdecilla in areas of high exposure and high risk of transmission of SARS COV2 (COVID hospital areas, Intensive Care Unit, Emergency, Anesthesia and all those performing aerosol-generating procedures) will be included. INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1) Health professionals aged between 18 and 65 years (inclusive) at the time of the first screening visit; 2) They must provide signed written informed consent and agree to comply with the study protocol; 3) Active work in high exposure areas during the last two weeks and during the following weeks. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: 1) Previous infection with SARS CoV2 (positive coronavirus PCR or positive serology with SARS Cov2 negative PCR and absence of symptoms); 2) Current treatment with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine; 3) Hypersensitivity, allergy or any contraindication for taking hydroxychloroquine, in the technical sheet; 4) Previous or current treatment with tamoxifen or raloxifene; 5) Previous eye disease, especially maculopathy; 6) Known heart failure (Grade III to IV of the New York Heart Association classification) or prolonged QTc; 7) Any type of cancer (except basal cell) in the last 5 years; 6) Refusal to give informed consent; 8) Evidence of any other unstable or clinically significant untreated immune, endocrine, hematological, gastrointestinal, neurological, neoplastic or psychiatric illness; 9) Antibodies positive for the human immunodeficiency virus; 10) Significant kidney or liver disease; 11) Pregnancy or lactation. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Two groups will be analyzed with a 1: 1 randomization rate. 1)Intervention: (n = 225): One 200 mg hydroxychloroquine sulfate coated tablet once daily for two months.2)Comparator (control group) (n = 225): One hydroxychloroquine placebo tablet (identical to that of the drug) once daily for two months MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome of this study will be to evaluate: number and percentage of healthcare personnel presenting symptomatic and asymptomatic infection (see ""Diagnosis of SARS CoV2 infection"" below) by the SARS-Cov2 virus during the study observation period (8 weeks) in both treatment arms;number and percentage of healthcare personnel in each group presenting with Pneumonia with severity criteria (Curb 65 &#8805;2) and number and percentage of healthcare personnel requiring admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in both treatment arms. DIAGNOSIS OF SARS COV2 INFECTION: Determination of IgA, IgM and IgG type antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 using the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA kit (EUROIMMUN Medizinische Labordiagnostika AG, Germany) every two weeks. In cases of seroconversion, a SARS-CoV-2 PCR will be performed to rule out / confirm an active infection (RT-PCR in One Step: RT performed with mastermix (Takara) and IDT probes, following protocol published and validated by the CDC Evaluation of COVID-19 in case of SARS-CoV-2 infection RANDOMISATION: Participants will be allocated to intervention and comparator groups according to a balanced randomization scheme (1: 1). The assignment will be made through a computer-generated numeric sequence for all participants BLINDING (MASKING): Both participants and investigators responsible for recruiting and monitoring participants will be blind to the assigned arm. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): Taking into account the current high prevalence of infection in healthcare personnel in Spain (up to 15%), to detect a difference equal to or greater than 8% in the percentage estimates through a two-tailed 95% CI, with a statistical power of 80% and a dropout rate of 5%, a total of 450 participants will need to be included (250 in each arm).

One approach has been the distance learning problem-based learning (PBL) tutorial utilising the online peer-to-peer platform. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of students using distance learning PBL tutorials using with that of students utilising the conventional face-to-face approach. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in a single academic institution. We compared two groups of fourth-year medical students from the same class: one group used distance learning (DL); the other, the face-to-face (FF) method. We used students' baseline performance at the preceding block for one-to-one propensity score matching. Students utilising the PBL tutorial were given grades by their tutors according to a standardised scoring system encompassing five key areas (score range: 0-10). The main outcome was a student's total score (i.e., the sum of the scores from the five key areas, ranging from 0 to 50). RESULT: We matched 62 students in each group. With four tutorials, there were 490 observations, with 245 in each group. The mean total score for the DL group was 37.5 ± 4.6, which was significantly lower than that of the FF group (39.0 ± 4.4, p < 0.001). We noted that students in the DL group had a significantly lower scores for all five areas of proficiency: participation, communication, preparation, critical thinking and group skills. CONCLUSION: Findings of this study revealed that the performance of students utilising the DL PBL tutorials was lower than that of students participating in the conventional FF approach. Further studies are needed to ascertain the underlying cause.","Foo, Chi-Chung; Cheung, Billy; Chu, Kent-Man",BMC Med Educ,505,16

Updated data on COVID-19 prevalence are needed for their relevance in public health and for infection control policies. In this single-centre cross-sectional study we aimed to assess prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection through IgG antibodies detection in an Italian pediatric cohort. METHODS: The study was conducted in January 2021 among both inpatients and outpatients referring to Research Institute for Maternal and Child Health ""Burlo Garofolo"" in Trieste, Friuli Venezia-Giulia, Italy, who needed for blood test for any reason. Collected samples were sent to Italian National Institute of Health for analysis through chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA). RESULTS: One hundred sixty-nine patients were included in the study, with a median age of 10.5 ± 4.1 years, an equal distribution for sex (49.7% female patients), and a 55.6% prevalence of comorbidities. Prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 trimeric Spike protein IgG antibodies was 9.5% (n = 16), with a medium titre of 482.3 ± 387.1 BAU/mL. Having an infected cohabitant strongly correlated with IgG positivity (OR 23.83, 95% CI 7.19-78.98, p < 0.0001), while a cohabitant healthcare worker wasn't associated with a higher risk (OR 1.53, 95% CI 0.4-5.86, p 0.46). All of the 5 patients who had previously tested positive to a nasopharyngeal swab belonged to the IgG positive group, with a 3-month interval from the infection at most. CONCLUSION: We assessed a 9.5% SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in a pediatric cohort from Friuli Venezia-Giulia region in January 2021, showing a substantial increase after the second peak of the pandemic occurred starting from October 2020, compared to 1% prevalence observed by National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) in July 2020.","Comar, Manola; Benvenuto, Simone; Lazzerini, Marzia; Fedele, Giorgio; Barbi, Egidio; Amaddeo, Alessandro; Risso, Francesco Maria; Strajn, Tamara; Di Rocco, Paola; Stefanelli, Paola; Rezza, Giovanni",Ital J Pediatr,505,20

Using the Maximum-Hasting (MH) parameter estimation method and the modified Susceptible Exposed Infectious Recovered (SEIR) model, the spread of the epidemic under three intervention scenarios (suppression, mitigation, mildness) is simulated and predicted in South Africa, Egypt, and Algeria, where the epidemic situations are severe. The studies are also conducted in Nigeria, Senegal and Kenya, where the epidemic situations are growing rapidly and the socio-economic are relatively under-developed, resulting in more difficulties in preventing the epidemic. Results indicated that the epidemic can be basically controlled in late April with strict control of scenario one, manifested by the circumstance in the South Africa and Senegal. Under moderate control of scenario two, the number of infected people will increase by 1.43-1.55 times of that in scenario one, the date of the epidemic being controlled will be delayed by about 10 days, and Algeria, Nigeria, and Kenya are in accordance with this situation. In the third scenario of weak control, the epidemic will be controlled by late May, the total number of infected cases will double that in scenario two, and Egypt is in line with this prediction.

Progesterone has been speculated to be involved in the mediation of pathogen disgust in women, though with mixed experimental support. Here we considered the effects of acute progesterone on the disgust-like avoidance responses of female mice to pathogen threat. Estrous female mice discriminated and avoided the urinary and associated odors of males subclinically infected with the murine nematode parasite, Heligmosomoides polygyrus. These avoidance responses were not significantly affected by pre-treatment with progesterone. Likewise, brief (1â¯min) exposure to the odors of infected males attenuated the subsequent responses of females to the odors of the normally preferred unfamiliar males and enhanced their preferences for familiar males. Neither progesterone nor allopregnanolone, a central neurosteroid metabolite of progesterone, had any significant effects on the avoidance of unfamiliar males elicited by pre-exposure to a parasitized male. Progesterone and allopregnanolone, did, however, significantly attenuate the typical preferences of estrous females for unfamiliar uninfected males, suggestive of effects on social recognition. These findings with mice indicate that progesterone may have minimal effects on the responses to specific parasite threat and the expression of pathogen disgust but may influence more general social recognition and preferences.","Kavaliers, Martin; Bishnoi, Indra R; Ossenkopp, Klaus-Peter; Choleris, Elena",Horm Behav,505,16

Currently, the world is suffering from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a virus that uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to enter the host cells. In COVID-19, neurological manifestations have been reported to occur. The present study demonstrates that the protein expression level of ACE2 is upregulated in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease. The increased ACE2 expression is not age-dependent, suggesting the direct relationship between Alzheimer's disease and ACE2 expression. Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, and brains with the disease examined in this study also exhibited higher carbonylated proteins, as well as an increased thiol oxidation state of peroxiredoxin 6 (Prx6). A moderate positive correlation was found between the increased ACE2 protein expression and oxidative stress in brains with Alzheimer's disease. In summary, the present study reveals the relationships between Alzheimer's disease and ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. These results suggest the importance of carefully monitoring patients with both Alzheimer's disease and COVID-19 in order to identify higher viral loads in the brain and long-term adverse neurological consequences.","Ding, Qiyue; Shults, Nataliia V; Gychka, Sergiy G; Harris, Brent T; Suzuki, Yuichiro J",Int. j. mol. sci.

The program was a collaboration between a government-managed national hospital, an infectious disease research institute, and a blood banking organization. Each party assumed different responsibilities: recruitment, SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiling, and plasmapheresis; conduction of screening tests; and SARS-CoV-2 blood testing, respectively. METHODS: We adopted a two-point screening approach before the collected CCP was labeled as a CCP product for investigational use, for which we mainly tested anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody eligibility and blood product eligibility. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein titer was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the IC50 value was denoted as the neutralizing activity. Blood donor eligibility was extended beyond the normal blood donation guidelines to include a broader range of participants. After both eligibility criteria were confirmed, participants were asked to revisit the hospital for blood donation, which is a unique aspect of the Japanese CCP program, as most donations are taking place in normal blood donation venues in other countries. Some donors were re-scheduled for repeat plasma donations. As public interest in anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies increased, test results were given to the participants. RESULTS: As of September 17, 2020, our collection of CCP products was sufficient to treat more than 100 patients. As a result, projects for administration and distribution are also being conducted. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully implemented a CCP procurement scheme with the goal to expand to other parts of the country to improve treatment options for COVID-19.","Terada, Mari; Kutsuna, Satoshi; Togano, Tomiteru; Saito, Sho; Kinoshita, Noriko; Shimanishi, Yumiko; Suzuki, Tetsuya; Miyazato, Yusuke; Inada, Makoto; Nakamoto, Takahito; Nomoto, Hidetoshi; Ide, Satoshi; Sato, Mitsuhiro; Maeda, Kenji; Matsunaga, Akihiro; Satake, Masahiro; Matsubayashi, Keiji; Tsuno, Hirokazu; Kojima, Makiko; Kuramistu, Madoka; Tezuka, Kenta; Ikebe, Emi; Okuma, Kazu; Hamaguchi, Isao; Shiratori, Katsuyuki; Sato, Motohiko; Kawakami, Yuiko; Inaba, Kumi; Igarashi, Saori; Yamauchi, Reina; Matsumura, Mina; Ishimaru, Keiko; Zhang, Bijuan; Kuge, Chika; Ishihara, Maiko; Gouda, Miho; Tanaka, Keiko; Ishizaka, Yukihito; Ohmagari, Norio",Transfusion,505,33

METHODS: We analyzed a single-center case series of pediatric patients with rheumatic diseases and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Demographic, baseline and COVID-19 associated clinical features were compared between ambulatory and hospitalized patients using univariate analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-five cases were identified: 45 (81.8%) in the ambulatory group and 10 (18.2%) hospitalized. African American race (OR 7.78; 95% CI [1.46-55.38]; p = 0.006) and cardiovascular disease (OR 19.40; 95% CI 2.45-254.14; p = 0.001) predominated in hospitalized patients.

BTK inhibition was shown to protect against lethal influenza-induced acute lung injury in mice. Inhibiting BTK has been hypothesized to ameliorate lung injury in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Objective To evaluate the use of BTK inhibitors (BTKinibs) during COVID-19 and assess how they may affect patient outcomes.Evidence ReviewWe searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science: Core on December 30, 2020. Clinical studies with at least 5 COVID-19 patients treated with BTKinibs were included. Case reports and reviews were excluded.Findings One hundred twenty-five articles were identified, 6 of which met inclusion criteria. Sample size ranged from 6 to 126 patients. Patient populations included subjects hospitalized with COVID-19 (6/6) and admitted to the intensive care unit (5/6). Patient age ranged between 35 and 98 years. Four studies included patients already receiving BTKinibs for their lymphoproliferative disease, 1 for Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and 3 for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The most common clinical outcomes measured were oxygen requirements (4/6) and hospitalization rate or duration (3/6). Differences in standard-of-care reflected the date of study and pre-existing conditions in the various patient cohorts. Full-dose acalabrutinib was evaluated in 2 studies, one study evaluated full-dose ibrutinib, and another study evaluated both ibrutinib and acalabrutinib. The remainder 2 studies described outcomes in CLL patients on multiple BTKinibs and other CLL-targeted treatments. Three studies showed decreased oxygen requirements in patients who started or continued BTKinibs. All three studies that evaluated hospitalization rate or duration found favorable outcomes in those on BTKinibs. Conclusions and Relevance BTKinib use was associated with decreased oxygen requirements and decreased hospitalization rates and duration. However, randomized clinical trials are needed to validate the beneficial effects of BTKinibs for acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Stack, M.; Sacco, K.; Castagnoli, R.; Livinski, A. A.; Notarangelo, L.

The secondary objectives were 1) to compare the MLUS and National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2), as well as the combination of both scores, as predictors of severity according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement;and 2) to compare severity assessed by ultrasound scoring to severity assessed by lung computed tomography (CT). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Multicenter prospective observational cohort study conducted from March 30 to April 30, 2020, in 2 university hospitals. Adult patients with dyspnea due to COVID-19 were included. An initial lung ultrasound was performed, and the results of MLUS, NEW2, and lung CT evaluations were recorded. Patients were classified by risk according to the WHO scale at 48 hours, as follows: low risk (score less than 5) or high risk (score of 5 or more). RESULTS: A total of 100 patients were included: 35 (35%) were classified as low risk and 65 (65%) as high risk. The correlation between the MLUS and WHO assessments was positive and very high (Spearman rank correlation ? = 0.832;P .001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the MLUS, NEW2 and combined ultrasound scores, in relation to prediction of risk classification were, respectively, 0.96 (0.93-0.99), 0.89 (0.82-0.95) and 0.98 (0.96-1.0).

One alarming concern during the pandemic is the rise of racism against Asians all over the world. However, little explored behind media reports are the legacies, tensions and challenges left by imperial domination inherited from the past, especially within the postcolonial regimes in Asia, such as Hong Kong and China. Drawing upon postcolonialism as a critical lens, this article makes perceptible the intractable issues of health politics. Postcolonial challenges shown by COVID-19 include immigration, changing politico-juridical definitions of identity, the legacy left by the Soviet era which poses an obstacle to modernising China's healthcare system, and the boom of birth tourism welcomed by the marketised turn of health and tourism policy in Hong Kong in the post-SARS era.

While the most severe of these cases require renal replacement therapy (RRT), little is known about their clinical course. METHODS: We describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in the ICU with AKI requiring RRT at an academic medical center in New York City and followed patients for outcomes of death and renal recovery using time-to-event analyses. RESULTS: Our cohort of 115 patients represented 23% of all ICU admissions at our center, with a peak prevalence of 29%. Patients were followed for a median of 29 days (2542 total patient-RRT-days; median 54 days for survivors). Mechanical ventilation and vasopressor use were common (99% and 84%, respectively), and the median Sequential Organ Function Assessment (SOFA) score was 14. By the end of follow-up 51% died, 41% recovered kidney function (84% of survivors), and 8% still needed RRT (survival probability at 60 days: 0.46 [95% CI: 0.36-0.56])). In an adjusted Cox model, coronary artery disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were associated with increased mortality (HRs: 3.99 [95% CI 1.46-10.90] and 3.10 [95% CI 1.25-7.66]) as were angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (HR 2.33 [95% CI 1.21-4.47]) and a SOFA score >15 (HR 3.46 [95% CI 1.65-7.25). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our analysis demonstrates the high prevalence of AKI requiring RRT among critically ill patients with COVID-19 and is associated with a high mortality, however, the rate of renal recovery is high among survivors and should inform shared-decision making.","Stevens, Jacob S; King, Kristen L; Robbins-Juarez, Shelief Y; Khairallah, Pascale; Toma, Katherine; Alvarado Verduzco, Hector; Daniel, Emily; Douglas, Denzil; Moses, Andrew A; Peleg, Yonatan; Starakiewicz, Piotr; Li, Miah T; Kim, Daniel W; Yu, Kathleen; Qian, Long; Shah, Vaqar H; O039,; Donnell, Max R; Cummings, Matthew J; Zucker, Jason; Natarajan, Karthik; Perotte, Adler; Tsapepas, Demetra; Krzysztof, Kiryluk; Dube, Geoffrey; Siddall, Eric; Shirazian, Shayan; Nickolas, Thomas L; Rao, Maya K; Barasch, Jonathan M; Valeri, Anthony M; Radhakrishnan, Jai; Gharavi, Ali G; Husain, S Ali; Mohan, Sumit",PLoS One,505,1

The initial response can be crucial to outcomes, all the while recognising that changes may be needed as the emergency progresses. The recent coronavirus pandemic demonstrated how the course of action taken by authorities endorsing these protective behaviours early on can save thousands of lives. Factors that determine response success include public compliance with authorities' recommendations and cooperation between experts and rescuers. In particular, the way rescuers perceive the risks of ionising radiation hazards will influence their preparedness to respond in case of a radiological or nuclear emergency. Having found no previous studies on radiological hazard and risk perception amongst rescuers in Portugal, mental models were used as a descriptive approach. The target groups were firefighters and the military formally trained to deal with radiation hazard emergencies. Their representations of radiological hazards and risks were analysed in the light of an expert model built ad hoc. The results show several overlays between experts and rescuers on the understanding of radiation hazards and potential risks. We conclude that the main gap between radiation risk perceptions by rescuers and experts involves the concepts and mechanisms of radiation contamination and its spread among individuals, in particular, if persons exposed to radioactive sources may also become a radioactive source themselves. This gap can have practical implications for an emergency response.","Melo, Ana Rita; Silva, Rui M C; Palma-Oliveira, José Manuel; Martins, Décio Ruivo",J Radiol Prot,505,16

It is obvious that SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is needed to control the global COVID-19 public health crisis. Since obvious advantages including fast manufacturing speed, potent immunogenicity and good safety profile, six mRNA vaccines have been used to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections in clinic with lipid nanoparticles (LNP) formulation via intramuscular injection. In this work, we first constructed RBD-encoding mRNA (RBD-mRNA) formulated in liposomes (LPX/RBD-mRNA) and investigated the influence of administration routes on the immunogenicity. LPX/RBD-mRNA can express RBD in vivo and successfully induced SARS-CoV-2 RBD specific antibodies in the vaccinated mice, which efficiently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus. Moreover, the administration routes were found to affect the virus neutralizing capacity of sera derived from the immunized mice and the types (Th1-type and Th2-type) of cellular immune responses. This study indicated that liposome-based RBD-mRNA vaccine with optimal administration route might be a potential candidate against SARS-CoV-2 infection with good efficacy and safety.","Huang, Hai; Zhang, Caili; Yang, Shuping; Xiao, Wen; Zheng, Qian; Song, Xiangrong",J. control. release,505,16

studies, mental distress increased substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic In this period, citizens were asked to exercise a high degree of self-control with regard to personal and social health behavior At the same time, we witnessed an increase of prosocial acts and shared creative expressions, which are known to serve as sources of meaning Meaning in life and self-control are acknowledged psychological resources Especially in times of crisis, meaning in life has been shown to be a crucial factor for resilience and coping However, threatening and stressful situations can also jeopardize existential security and trigger crises of meaning The present study aimed to document levels of acute COVID-19 stress and general mental distress in Germany and Austria during the lockdown and in the weeks thereafter In order to identify potential risk factors related to demographics and living conditions, their associations with COVID-19 stress were analyzed exploratively The primary objective of the study, however, was to investigate the buffering effect of two psychological resources—meaningfulness and self-control—with regard to the relation between acute COVID-19 stress and general mental distress Finally, a potential aggravation of mental distress due to the occurrence of crises of meaning was examined Method: A cross-sectional survey was conducted online during lockdown (survey group 1) and the subsequent weeks characterized by eased restrictions (survey group 2) A total of N = 1,538 German-speaking participants completed a questionnaire battery including a novel measure of acute COVID-19 stress, meaningfulness and crisis of meaning (SoMe), self-control (SCS-KD), and a screening of general mental distress, measured by core symptoms of depression and anxiety (PHQ-4) In a first step, associations between living conditions, demographics, and COVID-19 stress were explored Second, a moderation and a mediation model were tested Meaningfulness, a measure of presence of meaning in life, as well as self-control were proposed to serve as buffers in a time of crisis, thus moderating the relation between acute COVID-19 stress and general mental distress (double moderation) Crisis of meaning, operationalizing an experienced lack of meaning in life, was proposed to mediate the relationship between acute COVID-19 stress and general mental distress, with an assumed moderation of the association between COVID-19 stress and crisis of meaning by survey group (lockdown versus eased restrictions after lockdown), and a hypothesized moderation of the link between crisis of meaning and general mental distress by self-control (dual moderated mediation) Results: COVID-19 stress was slightly right-skewed Scores were higher during lockdown than in the weeks thereafter The rate of clinically significant general mental distress was high, exceeding prevalence rates from both the general population and clinical samples of the time before the pandemic In the weeks following the lockdown (group 2), general mental distress and crisis of meaning were significantly higher than during lockdown (group 1), whereas meaningfulness and self-control were significantly lower Demographically, age had the strongest association with COVID-19 stress, with older participants perceiving less acute stress (r = − 21) People who were partnered or married suffered less from COVID-19 stress (η2 = 01) Living alone (η2 = 006), living in a room versus a flat or house (η2 = 008), and being unemployed due to the pandemic (η2 = 008) were related to higher experience of COVID-19 stress COVID-19 stress and general mental distress were strongly related (r = 53) Both meaningfulness and self-control were negatively associated with general mental distress (r = − 40 and − 36, respectively) They also moderated the relationship between COVID-19 stress and general mental distress: When meaningfulness was high, high COVID-19 stress was related to substantially lower PHQ-4 scores than when meaningfulness was low The s me held for self-control: High scores of self-control were associated with lower PHQ-4 scores especially when COVID-19 stress was high Crisis of meaning mediated the relationship between COVID-19 stress and PHQ-4 There was a higher likelihood of crises of meaning occurring when COVID-19 stress was high;crisis of meaning, in turn, was associated with general mental distress Survey group moderated the first path of this mediation, i e , the relationship between COVID-19 stress and crisis of meaning: High scores of COVID-19 stress were associated more strongly with crisis of meaning in the second survey group (after the lockdown) Self-control moderated the second path, i e , the relationship between crisis of meaning and PHQ-4: When a crisis of meaning was present, self-control could buffer its effect on general mental distress Conclusions: Also in the present study among German-speaking participants, general mental distress was high Scores were higher after than during the lockdown, indicating an ongoing destabilization for a significant part of the population People who saw a meaning in their lives and who were capable of self-control reported substantially less mental distress Meaningfulness and self-control also served as buffers between COVID-19 stress and general mental distress: When COVID-19 stress was high, the presence of meaningfulness and self-control accounted for lower general mental distress Moreover, people who suffered strongly from COVID-19 stress were more likely to develop a crisis of meaning which, in turn, was associated with higher general mental distress This suggests that ongoing anxiety and depression might (also) be based on existential struggles Again here, self-control buffered the impact of crisis of meaning on general mental health We conclude from these findings that public health policies can support citizens in coping with large-scale crises by enabling experiences of meaningfulness, e g , through transparent and reliable modes of communicating goals and necessary intermediate steps Moreover, health professionals are well advised to invite individuals to confront existential questions and struggles, and to encourage them to exercise self-control The latter can be boosted by keeping higher-order goals salient—which again is inherently linked to an understanding of their meaning","Schnell, T.; Krampe, H.",Frontiers in Psychiatry,505,24

Few studies have reported hospital mortality data among older adults in sub-Saharan Africa. The objective of this study was to assess the mortality and associated factors among hospitalized older adults in Togo. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study from February 2018 to September 2019 among patients &#8805;50 years admitted in medical and surgical services of six hospitals in Togo. Data were recorded during hospitalization and through telephone follow-up survey within 90 days after admission. The main outcome was all-cause mortality at 3 months. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analyses were performed to assess predictors of mortality. RESULTS: The median age of the 650 older adults included in the study period was 61 years, IQR: [55-70] and at least one comorbidity was identified in 59.7% of them. The all-cause mortality rate of 17.2% (95%CI: 14.4-20.4) and the majority of death (93.7%) occurred in hospital. Overall survival rate was 85.5 and 82.8% after 30 and 90 days of follow-up, respectively. Factors associated with 3-month mortality were the hospital level in the health pyramid, hospitalization service, length of stay, functional impairment, depression and malignant diseases. CONCLUSION: Togolese health system needs to adjust its response to an aging population in order to provide the most effective care.","Gbeasor-Komlanvi, Fifonsi Adjidossi; Tchankoni, Martin Kouame; Bakoubayi, Akila Wimima; Lokossou, Matthieu Yaovi; Sadio, Arnold; Zida-Compaore, Wendpouiré Ida Carine; Djibril, Mohaman; Belo, Mofou; Agbonon, Amegnona; Ekouevi, Didier Koumavi",BMC Geriatr,505,22

There is a major bottleneck screening the vast number of potential small molecules to shortlist lead compounds for antiviral drug development. New opportunities to accelerate drug discovery lie at the interface between machine learning methods, in this case developed for linear accelerators, and physics-based methods. The two in silico methods, each have their own advantages and limitations which, interestingly, complement each other. Here, we present an innovative infrastructural development that combines both approaches to accelerate drug discovery. The scale of the potential resulting workflow is such that it is dependent on supercomputing to achieve extremely high throughput. We have demonstrated the viability of this workflow for the study of inhibitors for four COVID-19 target proteins and our ability to perform the required large-scale calculations to identify lead antiviral compounds through repurposing on a variety of supercomputers.","Bhati, Agastya P.; Wan, Shunzhou; Alfe, Dario; Clyde, Austin R.; Bode, Mathis; Tan, Li; Titov, Mikhail; Merzky, Andre; Turilli, Matteo; Jha, Shantenu; Highfield, Roger R.; Rocchia, Walter; Scafuri, Nicola; Succi, Sauro; Kranzlmuller, Dieter; Mathias, Gerald; Wifling, David; Donon, Yann; Meglio, Alberto Di; Vallecorsa, Sofia; Ma, Heng; Trifan, Anda; Ramanathan, Arvind; Brettin, Tom; Partin, Alexander; Xia, Fangfang; Duan, Xiaotan; Stevens, Rick; Coveney, Peter V.",,505,1

We focused on assessing the significant changes of pollutant concentrations during March-May for the years 2019 and 2020 utilizing the satellite datasets observed from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) reanalysis data. Low pollution levels were observed throughout the COVID-19 (March 25-May 31, 2020) compared to a similar period in 2019. The association of meteorology with air pollutants found that the periods of enhanced temperature and relative humidity likely contributed to a cleaner environment over the Indus Basin Region (IBR) and Balochistan Plateau (BP). The decrease in the mean planetary boundary layer Sulphur dioxide (SO2) during the lockdown period of 2020 (DLP-2020) was evident by -36% in BP, -34% in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), and -15.15% in IBR when compared to before the lockdown period of 2019 (BLP-2019). This is attributed to the limited transportation and control action plans of industrial activities including combustion sources taken by the Government of Pakistan for the DLP-2020 phase. During DLP-2020, a variable and least significant decline in surface particulate matter of size 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) concentration was observed in the urban regions of KPK (-19.17%) followed by IBR (-0.82%) and BP (-0.26%). Overall, a considerable reductions in Carbon monoxide (CO) and black carbon (BC) concentrations were smaller in rural and suburban areas of BP (-3.61%, -8.57%) followed by KPK (-0.79%, -11.39%) and IBR (-3.30%, -11.39%), respectively. This is due to the reduction in local emissions related to the lockdown measures taken in the control of pandemic. However, the ozone (O-3) concentrations witnessed an increase to a lower extent as 11.39%, 5.78%, and 4.74% in KPK, BP, and IBR, respectively attributed to rising in solar radiation intensity and temperature in hot summers, and decrease in NOx levels during the study period.","Khan, R.; Kumar, K.

This study conducted two experiments to explore this question during the COVID-19 epidemic. Experiment 1 (Nâ¯=â¯92, M ageâ¯=â¯22.52, 48.91% was male) manipulated the focus regarding the COVID-19 epidemic to investigate the impact of this focus on participants' emotions. The results showed that compared with the nonepidemic focus group, the epidemic focus group had higher negative emotions and lower positive emotions. Experiment 2 (Nâ¯=â¯200, M ageâ¯=â¯23.91, 49% was male) manipulated the epidemic focus and GBJW to investigate their effects on the participants' emotions. The results showed that high levels of GBJW reduced negative emotions and increased positive emotions regardless of whether the participants were focused on the epidemic. This study expands the influence of the GBJW on individual emotions and finds that the GBJW can protect individuals' emotions when they face a major social disaster. These findings imply that controlling people's intake of information on the epidemic can avoid their suffering from the vicarious traumatization caused by epidemic-related information overload and that improving the public's GBJW protects their mental health during an epidemic.","Wang, Jin; Wang, Zhuo; Liu, Xiaojin; Yang, Xiaofan; Zheng, Meilin; Bai, Xuejun",Pers Individ Dif,505,20

Professional societies have recommended insulin therapy as the cornerstone of inpatient pharmacological management. Intravenous insulin therapy is the treatment of choice in the critical care setting. In non-intensive care settings, several insulin protocols have been proposed to manage patients with hyperglycaemia; however, meta-analyses comparing different treatment regimens have not clearly endorsed the benefits of any particular strategy. Clinical guidelines recommend stopping oral antidiabetes drugs during hospitalisation; however, in some countries continuation of oral antidiabetes drugs is commonplace in some patients with type 2 diabetes admitted to hospital, and findings from clinical trials have suggested that non-insulin drugs, alone or in combination with basal insulin, can be used to achieve appropriate glycaemic control in selected populations. Advances in diabetes technology are revolutionising day-to-day diabetes care and work is ongoing to implement these technologies (ie, continuous glucose monitoring, automated insulin delivery) for inpatient care.

Disadvantaged groups are impacted more directly and in disproportionately higher numbers due to existing poor health, and the disruption of services central to securing an income and an education will have lasting consequences for their futures. The unintended effect of exclusionary government policies is that privileged citizens and healthcare systems are also at greater risk.

Patients vulnerable to severe COVID-19 are at risk of hydroxychloroquine interactions with co-morbidities and co-medications contributing to detrimental, including fatal, adverse treatment effects. METHODS: A retrospective survey was undertaken of health conditions and co-medications of patients with COVID-19 who were pre-screened for enrolment in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled hydroxychloroquine multi-centre trial. RESULTS: The survey involved 305 patients [median age 71 (interquartile range 59-81) years]. The majority of patients (n = 279, 92%) considered for inclusion in the clinical trial were not eligible, mainly due to safety concerns caused by health conditions or co-medications. The most common were QT-prolonging drugs (n = 188, 62%) and haematologic/haemato-oncologic diseases (n = 39, 13%) which prohibited the administration of hydroxychloroquine. In addition, 165 (54%) patients had health conditions and 167 (55%) patients were on co-medications that did not prohibit the use of hydroxychloroquine but had a risk of adverse interactions with hydroxychloroquine. The most common were diabetes (n = 86, 28%), renal insufficiency (n = 69, 23%) and heart failure (n = 58, 19%). CONCLUSION: The majority of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 had health conditions or took co-medications precluding safe treatment with hydroxychloroquine.

We use the daily electricity consumption data of nearly 20 thousand firms in Shanghai from 2018 to 2020 to construct the ECU indexes. Results show that all ECU indexes, no matter at sectoral level or regional level, successfully captured the negative impacts of COVID-19 on Shanghai's economic conditions. Besides, the ECU indexes also presented the heterogeneities in different districts as well as in different sectors. This reflects the facts that changes in uncertainties of economic conditions are mainly related to regional economic structures and targeted regulation policies faced by sectors.

While PCR is rapid and highly accurate, it requires costly laboratory equipment and healthcare professionals that limit its use for large-scale screening of mild or asymptomatic patients. Self-collection kits for use in the home could remedy this and have consequently received great attention. In April, 2020, a self-collection kit from LapCorp was the first such kit to be approved by the FDA. In the following month, May 2020, another kit developed by Everlywell received FDA approval, and more kits are evidently on their way to the market in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. Because these home-based, self-collection kits are easy to use and may be more acceptable for patients, they provide a superior screening option for mild or asymptomatic patients under self-quarantine. These kits conserve personal protective equipment and healthcare manpower already in short supply. The primary issues affecting the efficacy of this approach are the potential for inappropriate sampling and insufficient clinical examination. A detailed review of the commercially available kits currently available is provided and their prospective impact is noted during the current pandemic.","Liao, Wan-Ting; Hsu, Min-Yen; Shen, Ching-Fen; Hung, Kai-Feng; Cheng, Chao-Min",Adv Biosyst,505,1

OBJECTIVE: To describe typical imaging findings in children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, imaging studies and clinical data from children treated for multisystem inflammatory syndrome were collected from multiple centres. Standardised case templates including demographic, biochemical and imaging information were completed by participating centres and reviewed by paediatric radiologists and paediatricians. RESULTS: We included 37 children (21 boys; median age 8.0 years). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 15/37 (41%) children and immunoglobulins in 13/19 children (68%). Common clinical presentations were fever (100%), abdominal pain (68%), rash (54%), conjunctivitis (38%) and cough (32%). Thirty-three children (89%) showed laboratory or imaging findings of cardiac involvement. Thirty of the 37 children (81%) required admission to the intensive care unit, with good recovery in all cases. Chest radiographs demonstrated cardiomegaly in 54% and signs of pulmonary venous hypertension/congestion in 73%. The most common chest CT abnormalities were ground-glass and interstitial opacities (83%), airspace consolidation (58%), pleural effusion (58%) and bronchial wall thickening (42%). Echocardiography revealed impaired cardiac function in half of cases (51%) and coronary artery abnormalities in 14%. Cardiac MRI showed myocardial oedema in 58%, pericardial effusion in 42% and decreased left ventricular function in 25%. Twenty children required imaging for abdominal symptoms, the commonest abnormalities being free fluid (71%) and terminal ileum wall thickening (57%). Twelve children underwent brain imaging, showing abnormalities in two cases. CONCLUSION: Children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome showed pulmonary, cardiac, abdominal and brain imaging findings, reflecting the multisystem inflammatory disease. Awareness of the imaging features of this disease is important for early diagnosis and treatment.","Caro-Domínguez, Pablo; Navallas, María; Riaza-Martin, Lucia; Ghadimi Mahani, Maryam; Ugas Charcape, Carlos F; Valverde, Israel; D039,; Arco, Felice; Toso, Seema; Shelmerdine, Susan Cheng; van Schuppen, Joost; Secinaro, Aurelio; Gräfe, Daniel; Camacho, Marisol; Neth, Olaf; Goo, Hyun Woo; Kellenberger, Christian J",Pediatr. radiol,505,18

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the impact of WFH policy on said health aspects in Indonesia. Methods: We conducted an observational study with a cross-sectional approach using an online survey among premenopausal married women in Indonesia. The survey included the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) for psychological distress, average sexual intercourse frequency (SIF) per week, contraception use, change of menstrual pattern, and desire for having children. To analyze the effect of WFH, the participants were divided into groups based on their WFH compliance: (1) Both couples (her and her spouse) work from home, (2) Only the wife works from home, (3) Only the husband works from home, and (4) Neither works from home. Results: 348 women were included in this study. Psychological distress occurred in 48.0% (n = 167) participants. No significant difference was found between the WFH groups (χ 2[3, N = 348] = 2.077, p = .56)). The average weekly SIF was found to be significantly fewer during WFH (T = 5014, z = −5.598, p &lt; .001). However, only 22.7% (n = 79) participants reported the use of contraception and 52.9% (n = 196) participants still wanted to have children. Change of menstrual pattern occurred in 31.6% (n = 110) participants and were significantly correlated to psychological distress (rs = .126, p = .018). Conclusions: WFH does not aggravate the effect of the pandemic on women's mental and reproductive health in Indonesia. A significant number of them still desire to have children and contraceptive prevalence is low.

The immediate actions from both academia and industry have led to the development of many COVID-19 diagnostic systems that have secured fast-track regulatory approvals and have been serving our healthcare frontlines since the early stage of the pandemic. On diagnostic technologies, many of these clinically validated systems have significantly benefited from the recent advances in micro- and nanotechnologies in terms of platform design, analytical method, and system integration and miniaturization. The continued development of new diagnostic platforms integrating micro- and nanocomponents will address some of the shortcomings we have witnessed in the existing COVID-19 diagnostic systems. This Perspective reviews the previous and ongoing research efforts on developing integrated micro- and nanosystems for nucleic acid-based virus detection, and highlights promising technologies that could provide better solutions for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and other viral infectious diseases. With the summary and outlook of this rapidly evolving research field, we hope to inspire more research and development activities to better prepare our society for future public health crises. The development of integrated molecular diagnostic platforms based on state-of-the-art micro- and nanotechnologies has greatly improved both laboratory-based and point-of-care testing of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

This paper proposes a generalized Markov-Switching approach, the SUIHR model, designed to study border control policies and contact tracing against COVID-19 in a period where countries start to re-open. We offer the following contributions. First, the SUIHR model can include multiple entities, reflecting different government bodies with different containment measures. Second, constraints as, for example, new case targets and medical resource limits can be imposed in a linear programming framework. Third, in contrast to most SIR models, we focus on the spreading of infectious people without symptoms instead of the spreading of people who are already showing symptoms. We find that even if a country has closed its borders completely, domestic contact tracing is not enough to go back to normal life. Countries having successfully controlled the virus can keep it under check as long as imported risk is not growing, meaning they can lift travel restrictions with similar countries. However, opening borders towards countries with less controlled infection dynamics would require a mandatory quarantine or a strict test on arrival.","Zhu, Zhen; Weber, Enzo; Strohsal, Till; Serhan, Duaa",,505,24

We present the first analysis of COVID-19 misinformation networks and determine few of its implications. Firstly, we analyze the spread trends of COVID-19 misinformation and discover that the COVID-19 misinformation statistics are well fitted by a log-normal distribution. Secondly, we form misinformation networks by taking individual misinformation as a node and similarity between misinformation nodes as links, and we decipher the laws of COVID-19 misinformation network evolution: (1) We discover that misinformation evolves to optimize the network information transfer over time with the sacrifice of robustness. (2) We demonstrate the co-existence of fit get richer and rich get richer phenomena in misinformation networks. (3) We show that a misinformation network evolution with node deletion mechanism captures well the public attention shift on social media. Lastly, we present a network science inspired deep learning framework to accurately predict which Twitter posts are likely to become central nodes (i.e., high centrality) in a misinformation network from only one sentence without the need to know the whole network topology. With the network analysis and the central node prediction, we propose that if we correctly suppress certain central nodes in the misinformation network, the information transfer of network would be severely impacted.","Cheng, Mingxi; Yin, Chenzhong; Nazarian, Shahin; Bogdan, Paul",Sci Rep,505,16

Although many tools have been proposed for this task, they are mainly focused on the query and visualization of a single protein with its neighborhood. The global exploration of the entire network and the interpretation of its underlying structure still remains difficult, mainly due to the excessively large size of the biomolecular networks. In this paper we propose a novel multi-resolution representation and exploration approach that exploits hierarchical community detection algorithms for the identification of communities occurring in biomolecular networks. The proposed graphical rendering combines two types of nodes (protein and communities) and three types of edges (protein-protein, community-community, protein-community), and displays communities at different resolutions, allowing the user to interactively zoom in and out from different levels of the hierarchy. Links among communities are shown in terms of relationships and functional correlations among the biomolecules they contain. This form of navigation can be also combined by the user with a vertex centric visualization for identifying the communities holding a target biomolecule. Since communities gather limited-size groups of correlated proteins, the visualization and exploration of complex and large networks becomes feasible on off-the-shelf computer machines. The proposed graphical exploration strategies have been implemented and integrated in UNIPred-Web, a web application that we recently introduced for combining the UNIPred algorithm, able to address both integration and protein function prediction in an imbalance-aware fashion, with an easy to use vertex-centric exploration of the integrated network. The tool has been deeply amended from different standpoints, including the prediction core algorithm. Several tests on networks of different size and connectivity have been conducted to show off the vast potential of our methodology; moreover, enrichment analyses have been performed to assess the biological meaningfulness of detected communities. Finally, a CoV-human network has been embedded in the system, and a corresponding case study presented, including the visualization and the prediction of human host proteins that potentially interact with SARS-CoV2 proteins.","Perlasca, Paolo; Frasca, Marco; Ba, Cheick Tidiane; Gliozzo, Jessica; Notaro, Marco; Pennacchioni, Mario; Valentini, Giorgio; Mesiti, Marco",PLoS One,505,32

METHODS: Retrospective cohort analysis from 2007 to 2017 using medical and prescription claims from an administrative database (IQVIA&#8482; Health Plan Claims Database) among adult patients with a diagnosis of gout. Primary endpoint was the proportion of patients receiving AGP among all patients newly initiated on XOI therapy. Secondary endpoints included incidence proportions of acute flare and of XOI discontinuation among patients who received AGP compared to those who did not. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used in univariate analysis of proportions between treatment groups. RESULTS: A total of 7414 patients were included for analysis. There were 697 patients (9.4%) who received AGP with XOI initiation and colchicine alone was the most common medication used among patients who received prophylaxis (n = 303, 43.4%). The incidence proportion of patients with an acute gout flare within 3 months of index was 21.5% in the AGP cohort and 12.7% in the no prophylaxis cohort (p < 0.001). The proportion of patients who discontinued XOI within 12 months of initiation was 38.7% in the AGP cohort and 46.2% in the no prophylaxis cohort (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In the real world, the proportion of patients who receive AGP with initiation of XOI therapy is low and discontinuation of XOI within 12 months of initiation is significant.

Our purpose was to evaluate the anxiety and depression in spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) patients during the pandemic and to analyse the influencing factors. We conducted an online questionnaire survey among 307 SCA patients from China and selected 319 healthy people matched by sex and age as the control group. The questionnaire included general information, the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), and the self-rating depression scale (SDS). The relevant factors included COVID-19 risk factors, age, sex, body mass index (BMI), educational background, disease course, score on the scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA), Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) and International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS). The proportion of SCA patients with anxiety was 34.9%, and the proportion with depression was 56.7%. The SAS and SDS scores of the SCA patients were significantly higher than those of the control group (SAS: 45.8 ± 10.1 vs. 40.6 ± 8.9, P < 0.01; SDS: 55.1 ± 12.2 vs. 43.6 ± 11.9, P < 0.01).

AIM: This study investigated operating room nurses' anxiety levels and related factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The research was conducted between July and September 2020. The sample consisted of 192 operating room nurses. Data were collected using a descriptive questionnaire and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). RESULTS: Participants had moderate levels of anxiety. The risk factors associated with high levels of anxiety included having chronic diseases, working with patients causing worry, fear of contracting COVID-19 and transmitting it to loved ones, incompetence of hospitals in managing the pandemic, lack of support from hospital managers, taking few breaks and working long shifts due to preventive measures at the workplace. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS OF NURSING MANAGEMENT: The results show that operating room nurses have had moderate anxiety levels since the onset of the pandemic. Therefore, it is critical to regularly identify and meet their mental and emotional needs to implement early preventive interventions. Identifying risk factors will help recognize anxiety in operating room nurses and take measures to protect their mental health while working with high-risk patients in different clinics during the pandemic. What is more, managers should draw up action plans for extraordinary conditions, such as a pandemic.","Gül, Senay; Kiliç, Sevcan Toptas",J. nurs. manag,505,22

METHODS: Twenty-three participants took part in this trial with crossover design and performed two experimental sessions in a random order: Body-weight resistance exercise session (BWR) and a control session without exercise. BWR was composed of four exercises: inverted row, squat, , and sit-ups. The participants performed 3 sets of 30 s, in which they were instructed to perform as much repetitions as possible and as fast as possible. After each session, BP and glycemia were measured continuously for 60 min. RESULTS: Systolic BP decreased after BWR when compared with control at post 45': -7 (95%CI:-11 to -2) mmHg, p = .003 and post60': -7 (95%CI:-12 to -3) mmHg, p = .003. Diastolic BP decreased after BWR when compared with control at post 15': -6 (95%CI:-9 to -3) mmHg, p < .001; post 30': -6 (95%CI:-9 to -2) mmHg, p = .001; post45': -5 (95%CI:-9 to -2) mmHg, p = .005; and post60': -6 (95%CI: -8 to -3) mmHg, p < .001. No significant difference was found in glycemia between BWR and control sessions. CONCLUSION: BWR acutely reduces BP in middle-aged adults with hypertension without effects on usual glycemia responses. This alternative form of resistance training could facilitate access, adherence, and reduce health costs related to exercise programs.","Ferrari, Rodrigo; Cadore, Eduardo Lusa; Périco, Bibiana; Kothe, Gabriela Bartholomay",Clin Exp Hypertens,505,21

Background: The COVID-19-pandemic is an unprecedented, exceptional situation and necessitates numerous adaptations of structures and processes in the acute inpatient setting. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore how acute inpatient care was influenced by the pandemic and which implications may result for the future from nursing managers' and hygiene specialists' point of view. METHODS: Qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews with five nursing managers and three hygiene specialists in four German acute care hospitals. Interviews were interpreted by using content analysis. RESULTS: Interviewees described how everyday routines in their hospitals were adapted to the prioritized care for COVID-19 patients. Main challenges were uncertainty and anxiety among staff, relative scarcity of equipment and workforce resources and rapid implementation of new requirements for treatment capacities. This was addressed by targeted communication and information, large efforts to ensure resources and coordinated control of all processes by cross-department, interprofessional task forces. CONCLUSIONS: Adaptations made to the structures and procedures of care delivery during the pandemic hold potential for future improvements of routine care, e. g. new workplace and skill mix models. To identify detailed practical implications, a renewed and deepened data analysis is needed at a later point of time, with a larger distance to the period of the pandemic.","Silies, Katharina; Schley, Angelika; Sill, Janna; Fleischer, Steffen; Müller, Martin; Balzer, Katrin",Pflege,505,18

Drug repurposing is an efficient and cost-effective strategy with minimum risk for identifying novel potential treatment options by repositioning therapies that were previously approved for other clinical outcomes. Here, we used an integrated network-based pharmacologic and transcriptomic approach to screen drug candidates novel for COVID-19 treatment. Network-based proximity scores were calculated to identify the drug-disease pharmacological effect between drug-target relationship modules and COVID-19 related genes. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was then performed to determine whether drug candidates influence the expression of COVID-19 related genes and examine the sensitivity of the repurposing drug treatment to peripheral immune cell types. Moreover, we used the complementary exposure model to recommend potential synergistic drug combinations. We identified 18 individual drug candidates including nicardipine, orantinib, tipifarnib and promethazine which have not previously been proposed as possible treatments for COVID-19. Additionally, 30 synergistic drug pairs were ultimately recommended including fostamatinib plus tretinoin and orantinib plus valproic acid.

Data on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a hospital is rare and outbreaks among health care professionals are complex to control. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Over the course of 6 consecutive weeks we recorded data on an exponential outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 within our department. We reconstructed the assumed route of the spread of infection, and the employees' acute and late symptoms. Increasing preventive measures (mandatory face masks, intense training in hygiene, physical distancing whenever possible, and termination of visits from outside the hospital) were implemented. RESULTS: Within 6 weeks, 13 employees were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. All individuals had a moderate course, not resulting in hospitalization. The majority of infections was discovered after testing contacts of known cases, prior to their onset of symptoms and was predominantly related to removal of face masks during breaks. Increasing preventive measures resulted in a decline and finally containment of transmission rates amongst the staff, confirmed by mass testing at week 6, with no further SARS-CoV-2 infection. Three individuals, all in their late 40s or older, have lasting or newly onset neurological symptoms 8 months after their infection. CONCLUSIONS: Outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 are particularly difficult to contain in a medical setting, where employees work in close physical proximity. Adherence to preventive measures, particularly face masks, seem to be effective.","Brandt, Maximilian Peter; Jäger, Wolfgang; Epple, Stefan; Haferkamp, Axel; Schröder, Annette",Am. j. infect. control,505,16

The response to this pandemic has in many cases led to a significant change in the daily work of caring for cancer patients, the good results of which depend largely on time-adjusted protocols and multidisciplinary treatments. We present a review of local, surgical and radiotherapy treatment together with authors’ recommendations made from personal experience on ways to act in the diagnosis and surgical treatment of breast cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. The multidisciplinary Breast Committees must continue to meet weekly in videoconference format. All surgical actions and irradiations must be carried out with maximum safety for both the patients and the participating teams. Hypofractionation in radiation therapy should be the standard treatment. Sometimes it is recommended to apply a primary systemic treatment or even a primary irradiation.

Due to the complex pathogenesis and susceptibility of COVID-19, many commonly used drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 have not shown excellent clinical effects. Traditional Chinese medicine has a long clinical history of preventing and treating this respiratory infectious disease. Maxingshigan Decoction (MXSG) is widely used in China to treat COVID-19. However, there is no comprehensive and systematic evidence on the effectiveness and safety of Maxingshigan Decoction. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Clinical Trials, the Cochrane Library, Sino Med, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure up to September 2020. This study only screens clinical randomized controlled trials on MXSG for COVID-19 to evaluate its efficacy and safety. Data were extracted by 1 investigator and checked by an independent investigator. Review Manager 5.3 software was used for the data analysis. The dichotomous data is represented by relative risk, and the continuous is expressed by mean difference or standard mean difference, eventually the data is synthesized using a fixed effect model or a random effect model depending on whether or not heterogeneity exists. RESULTS: The time from a positive diagnosis to a negative result of 2 consecutive nucleic acid tests (not on the same day), cure rate.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the emergence of spatial inequities in COVID-19 testing, positivity, confirmed cases, and mortality in New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago during the first 6 months of the pandemic. DESIGN: Ecological, observational study at the ZIP code tabulation area (ZCTA) level from March to September 2020. SETTING: Chicago, New York, and Philadelphia. PARTICIPANTS: All populated ZCTAs in the 3 cities. MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes were ZCTA-level COVID-19 testing, positivity, confirmed cases, and mortality cumulatively through the end of September 2020. Predictors were the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Social Vulnerability Index and its 4 domains, obtained from the 2014-2018 American Community Survey. The spatial autocorrelation of COVID-19 outcomes was examined by using global and local Moran I statistics, and estimated associations were examined by using spatial conditional autoregressive negative binomial models. RESULTS: Spatial clusters of high and low positivity, confirmed cases, and mortality were found, co-located with clusters of low and high social vulnerability in the 3 cities. Evidence was also found for spatial inequities in testing, positivity, confirmed cases, and mortality. Specifically, neighborhoods with higher social vulnerability had lower testing rates and higher positivity ratios, confirmed case rates, and mortality rates. LIMITATIONS: The ZCTAs are imperfect and heterogeneous geographic units of analysis. Surveillance data were used, which may be incomplete.

Under this situation, the firm, as a member of the society, should also undertake social responsibilities to jointly respond to the COVID-19. The employee, as a principal part of firm, plays an important role in informatization management which may affects the level of corporate social responsibility. Their ability of informatization management will inevitably affect their access to the information of corporate social responsibility, thus affecting the level of corporate social responsibility. This paper takes A-share listed companies from 2011 to 2018 collected in CSMAR as samples to explore the relations between employees' ability of informatization and corporate social responsibility. This study, as an interdisciplinary research related to computer and management, adopts OLS, IV method and other mathematics methods to build models. Using the employee education level as a proxy for employees' ability of informatization management, this paper finds that firms with a high-quality workforce exhibit higher level of corporate social responsibility, especially in the areas with lower degree of marketization. According to the further analysis using the model of Sobel test, the internal control plays a mediating role between employees' ability of informatization management and corporate social responsibility. This study suggests that employee quality plays an important role in performing corporate social responsibility.

Recently, the impact of COVID-19 has relegated bats from biomedical darkness to the frontline of public health as bats are the natural reservoir of many viruses, including SARS-Cov-2. Many bat genomes have been sequenced recently, and sequences coding for antimicrobial peptides are available in the public databases. Here we provide a structural analysis of genome-predicted bat cathelicidins as components of their innate immunity. A total of 32 unique protein sequences were retrieved from the NCBI database. Interestingly, some bat species contained more than one cathelicidin. We examined the conserved cysteines within the cathelin-like domain and the peptide portion of each sequence and revealed phylogenetic relationships and structural dissimilarities. The antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activity of peptides was examined using bioinformatic tools. The peptides were modeled and subjected to docking analysis with the region binding domain (RBD) region of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The appearance of multiple forms of cathelicidins verifies the complex microbial challenges encountered by these species. Learning more about antiviral defenses of bats and how they drive virus evolution will help scientists to investigate the function of antimicrobial peptides in these species.","Pérez de la Lastra, José Manuel; Asensio-Calavia, Patricia; González-Acosta, Sergio; Baca-González, Victoria; Morales-delaNuez, Antonio",Molecules (Basel),505,26

However, massive testing could have helped to respond more effectively to Covid-19 crisis. In this paper, we study the trade-off between infection control, lockdown and testing. The aim is to understand how these policies can be effectively combined to contain Covid-19 without damaging the economy. An extended SIR epidemic model is developed to identify the set of testing and lockdown levels that lead to a reproduction number below one, thus to infection control and saving lives. Depending on whether the testing policy is static or dynamic, the model suggests that testing 4% to 7% of the population is the way to safely reopen the economy and the society.","Taamouti, Abderrahim",Oxf. bull. econ. stat,505,1

METHODS: This was a retrospective study of COVID-19 patients who underwent an HbA1c test. Their demographic data, medical history, signs and symptoms of COVID-19, laboratory test results, and final outcomes of COVID-19 treatment were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 132 patients were included and divided into three groups based on their blood glucose status. There were significant differences in SaO2, serum ferritin level, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), fibrinogen (Fbg) level, and IL6 level among the three groups. A pairwise comparison of the groups showed that groups B and C were significantly different from group A in terms of CRP, ESR, and Fbg, IL6, and serum ferritin levels (P < 0.05). Correlation analysis showed that there was a linear negative correlation between SaO2 and HbA1c (r = -0.22, P = 0.01), while there was a linear positive correlation between serum ferritin, CRP, Fbg, and ESR levels and HbA1c (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: High HbA1c level is associated with inflammation, hypercoagulability, and low SaO2 in COVID-19 patients, and the mortality rate (27.7%) is higher in patients with diabetes. Determining HbA1c level after hospital admission is thus helpful assessing inflammation, hypercoagulability, and prognosis of COVID-19 patients.","Wang, Zhenzhou; Du, Zhe; Zhu, Fengxue",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,505,22

Three scenarios were estimated: Scenario 1 with official MINSAL data; scenario 2 with official MINSAL data and recovery criteria proposed by international organizations of health; and scenario 3 with official MINSAL data, recovery criteria proposed by international organizations of health, and without considering deaths in the total recovered. There are considerable differences between scenario 1 compared to 2 and 3 in the number of deaths, active patients, and duration of the disease. Scenario 3, considered the most adverse, estimates a total of 11,000 infected people, 1,151 deaths, and that the peak of the disease will occur in the first days of May.

These measures aim to limit the COVID-19 infection rate and reduce the mortality rate of COVID-19. Given we are likely to see local lockdowns until a treatment or vaccine for COVID-19 is available, and their effectiveness depends on public acceptability, it is important to understand public preference for government responses. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Using a discrete choice experiment (DCE), this study will investigate the public's preferences for pandemic responses in the UK. Attributes (and levels) are based on: (1) lockdown measures described in policy documents; (2) literature on preferences for lockdown measures and (3) a social media analysis. Attributes include: lockdown type; lockdown length; postponement of usual non-urgent medical care; number of excess deaths; number of infections; impact on household spending and job losses. We will prepilot the DCE using virtual think aloud interviews with respondents recruited via Facebook. We will collect preference data using an online survey of 4000 individuals from across the four UK countries (1000 per country). We will estimate the relative importance of the attributes, and the trade-offs individuals are willing to make between attributes. We will test if respondents' preferences differ based on moral attitudes (using the Moral Foundation Questionnaire), socioeconomic circumstances (age, education, economic insecurity, health status), country of residence and experience of COVID-19. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The University of Aberdeen's College Ethics Research Board (CERB) has approved the study (reference: CERB/2020/6/1974). We will seek CERB approval for major changes from the developmental and pilot work. Peer-reviewed papers will be submitted, and results will be presented at public health and health economic conferences nationally and internationally. A lay summary will be published on the Health Economics Research Unit blog.","Genie, Mesfin G; Loría-Rebolledo, Luis Enrique; Paranjothy, Shantini; Powell, Daniel; Ryan, Mandy; Sakowsky, Ruben Andreas; Watson, Verity",BMJ Open,505,1

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted. Data were collected 6 April to 19 April 2020 using online-based, self-administered questionnaires. SETTING: 19 hospitals and health centres in Vietnam. PARTICIPANTS: 7 124 HCWs aged 21-60 years. RESULTS: The COVID-19 response-involved HCWs had higher anxiety likelihood (OR (95% CI)=4.41 (3.53 to 5.51)), higher depression likelihood (OR(95% CI)=3.31 (2.71 to 4.05)) and lower HRQoL score (coefficient, b(95% CI)=-2.14 (-2.89 to -1.38)), compared with uninvolved HCWs. Overall, HCWs who smoked or drank at unchanged/increased levels had higher likelihood of anxiety, depression and lower HRQoL scores; those with unchanged/healthier eating, unchanged/more physical activity and higher HL scores had lower likelihood of anxiety, depression and higher HRQoL scores. In comparison to uninvolved HCWs who smoked or drank at never/stopped/reduced levels, involved HCWs with unchanged/increased smoking or drinking had lower anxiety likelihood (OR(95% CI)=0.34 (0.14 to 0.83)) or (OR(95% CI)=0.26 (0.11 to 0.60)), and lower depression likelihood (OR(95% CI)=0.33 (0.15 to 0.74)) or (OR(95% CI)=0.24 (0.11 to 0.53)), respectively. In comparison with uninvolved HCWs who exercised at never/stopped/reduced levels, or with those in the lowest HL quartile, involved HCWs with unchanged/increased exercise or with one-quartile HL increment reported lower anxiety likelihood (OR(95% CI)=0.50 (0.31 to 0.81)) or (OR(95% CI)=0.57 (0.45 to 0.71)), lower depression likelihood (OR(95% CI)=0.40 (0.27 to 0.61)) or (OR(95% CI)=0.63 (0.52 to 0.76)), and higher HRQoL scores (b(95% CI)=2.08 (0.58 to 3.58)), or (b(95% CI)=1.10 (0.42 to 1.78)), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity and higher HL were found to protect against anxiety and depression and were associated with higher HRQoL. Unexpectedly, smoking and drinking were also found to be coping behaviours.

The deployment of mobile laboratories can help to detect pathogens, monitor the presence in a population, and inform public health authorities to take measures aimed at reducing pathogen spread. Materials and Methods: Available layouts and operational descriptions of mobile laboratories were analyzed for their suitability for the envisioned purpose and to assure high standards of biosafety and biosecurity. Recent media coverage on creative solutions for the diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2 (drive-through test centers, self-swab, inverse gloveboxes to protect health care workers) from various countries were considered. Results: A minimalistic and optimized design to construct a multifunctional laboratory on the chassis of a regular-sized box truck is proposed and can serve as a blueprint to rapidly develop additional diagnostic capacities. Discussion: For acute health threats including the current COVID-19 outbreak, rapid diagnosis of infection is key to recommend measures aimed at preventing the spread of the pathogen. Laboratory layouts that are similar to the one proposed here are used in stationary setups, and mobile laboratories have been built on varying platforms (trailers, shipping containers, etc).","Linster, Martin; Ng, Benson; Vijayan, Viji",Appl.

Patients with worse outcomes have exhibited higher blood plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Activation of the vitamin D receptor expressed on immune cells has been shown to directly reduce the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6, and indirectly affect C-reactive protein. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: The significance of the vitamin D pathway in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. THERAPEUTIC INNOVATION: Vitamin D supplementation in patients after diagnosis of COVID-19. PATIENTS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: We report 4 vitamin D deficient patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in April 2020 who were provided with either cholecalciferol of 1000 IU daily (standard dose) or ergocalciferol 50,000 IU daily for 5 days (high dose) as part of supplementation. CLINICAL OUTCOMES: Patients that received a high dose of vitamin D supplementation achieved normalization of vitamin D levels and improved clinical recovery evidenced by shorter lengths of stay, lower oxygen requirements, and a reduction in inflammatory marker status. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplementation may serve as a viable alternative for curtailing acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients in underserved communities where resources to expensive and sought-after medications may be scarce.

Endoscopic mucosal biopsy results are often negative, making diagnosis difficult. In these cases, endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) biopsy is a useful diagnostic method. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 78-year-old female was admitted to hospital due to dysphagia, and gastroscopy showed a concentric narrowing of the esophageal lumen with a smooth and undamaged esophageal mucosa. DIAGNOSES: Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) revealed that the esophageal mucosa was thickened with a low echo, and the layers of the esophageal wall could not be clearly distinguished. Cytologic and pathologic diagnoses were obtained through EUS-FNA, which suggested ESCC. INTERVENTIONS: According to the pathologic diagnosis obtained by EUS-FNA, surgery or radiotherapy were recommended for this patient. Eventually, this patient elected to seek treatment at another medical institution. OUTCOMES: This type of disease cannot be diagnosed according to gastroscopic biopsy alone, and the diagnosis was eventually confirmed through EUS-FNA. LESSONS: When an imaging examination suggests a possible malignant lesion of the oesophagus, EUS-FNA may be considered if the surface mucosa contains no endoscopic damage.

This review examines the current state of knowledge regarding the two principal diagnostic testing strategies for SARS-CoV-2 infection, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based testing and serology, and discusses COVID-19 diagnostic implications for solid organ transplantation. Recent Findings: The interpretation of diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 infection can present several challenges and raises questions regarding optimal donor and candidate screening as well as infection prevention practices in solid organ transplant recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Guidance from several societies regarding donor and recipient suitability for transplantation during the COVID-19 pandemic is reviewed. Prolonged positive testing by polymerase chain reaction has been described in transplant recipients which may impact infection prevention practices. Summary: The COVID-19 pandemic has put multiple aspects of solid organ transplantation at risk, with impacts on donor and recipient suitability, and mitigation of infection and transmission after transplantation. Accumulating evidence regarding diagnostic fidelity and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in immunocompromised patients will continue to inform optimal practices surrounding solid organ transplantation during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Trubin, Paul A; Azar, Marwan M; Malinis, Maricar",Curr Transplant Rep,505,16

Of 331 participants, 87% experienced shortage and higher cost of food and 14.8% lost their jobs. Symptoms increased in 29% and 36.6% failed to obtain medical help. Although 52.3% increased food preparation at home and purchased alternative foodstuffs, 53.8% had consumed gluten-containing foods. The Health Eating Index was intermediate/""needs improvement"" (mean 65.6 ± 13.3 points); in 49.9% (perception) and 44.4% (questionnaire), adherence was ""bad"". Anxiety and depression scores were above the cutoff in 28% and 40.4%, respectively. Adherence and mental health were strongly related. The likelihood of poor adherence was 2.3 times higher (p < 0.004) in participants declaring that pandemic altered GFD. Those suffering depressive symptoms were 1.3 times more likely to have poor adherence (p < 0.000). Depression and faulty GFD (mandatory for treatment) appear, affecting a high proportion of participants, suggesting that support measures aimed at these aspects would help improve the health condition of people that maintain GFD.

This debilitating viral pandemic not only paralyzed the normal daily life of the global community but also spread rapidly via global travel. To date there are no effective vaccines or specific treatments against this highly contagious virus; therefore, there is an urgent need to advocate novel prophylactic or therapeutic interventions for COVID-19. This brief opinion critically discusses the potential of Silymarin, a flavonolignan with diverse pharmacological activity having antiinflammatory, antioxidant, antiplatelet, and antiviral properties, with versatile immune-cytokine regulatory functions, that able to bind with transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and induce endogenous antiviral cytokine interferon-stimulated gene 15, for the management of COVID-19. Silymarin inhibits the expression of host cell surface receptor TMPRSS2 with a docking binding energy corresponding to -1,350.61 kcal/mol and a full fitness score of -8.11. The binding affinity of silymarin with an impressive virtual score exhibits significant potential to interfere with SARS-CoV-2 replication. We propose in-depth pre-clinical and clinical review studies of silymarin for the development of anti-COVID-19 lead, based on its clinical manifestations of COVID-19 and multifaceted bioactivities.","Palit, Partha; Mukhopadhyay, Aparna; Chattopadhyay, Debprasad",Phytother. res,505,21

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare the impact of initial government policies on this vulnerable older population between the UK and Australia during the first wave of attack. METHODS: We searched websites of governments in the UK and Australia and media outlets. We examined the key policies including the national lockdown dates and the distribution of some important resources (personal protective equipment and testing) and the effects of these initial policies on the mortality rates in the aged care homes during the first wave of attack of COVID-19. RESULTS: We found that both countries had prioritized resources to hospitals over aged care homes during the first wave of attack. Both countries had lower priority for aged care residents in hospitals (e.g. discharging without testing for COVID-19 or discouraging admissions). However, deaths in aged care homes were 270 times higher in the UK than in Australia as on 7 May 2020 (despite UK having a population only 2.5 times larger than Australia). The lower fatality rate in Australia may have been due to the earlier lockdown strategy when the total daily cases were low in Australia (118) compared to the UK (over 1000), as well as the better community viral testing regime in Australia. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the public health policy in Australia aimed towards earlier intervention with earlier national lockdown and more viral testing to prevent new cases. This primary prevention could have resulted in more lives being saved. In contrast, the initial policy in the UK focussed mainly on protecting resources for hospitals, and there was a delay in national lockdown intervention and lower viral testing rate, resulting in more lives lost in the aged care sector.","Chan, Daniel Kam Yin; Mclaws, Mary-Louise; Forsyth, Duncan Ronald",Int. j. qual. health care,505,28

Poland introduced extensive anti-epidemic measures relatively early, in order to slow down the spread of the disease. OBJECTIVES: The study aims at presenting recent data on COVID-19 hospitalization cases during the first months of this outbreak in Poland. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study is a retrospective, population-based study conducted using hospital discharge records that included a COVID-19 diagnosis. Data were obtained from the National Institute of Public Health, where they had been collected in a Polish hospital morbidity study. Data covered 8840 hospitalization records between February 2020 and September 2020. RESULTS: In the study group, we analyzed 8252 records of COVID-19 patients first-time hospitalizations, which accounted for 93 % of all hospitalization cases. The study group consisted of 4161 males (50.4% of all patients) and 4091 females (49.6% of all patients). Significantly more patients from urban than rural regions were hospitalized (21.8 per 100,000 vs 20.5 per 100,000; P<0.02). In the period subject to analysis, 1073 in-hospital deaths were observed (13% of all patients), 965 of which occurred during the first-time hospitalizations (11.7% of all patients). In the study group patients with fatal hospitalizations in comparison to patients with non-fatal hospitalizations were significantly older, more frequently from urban areas, and they had more comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings, especially differences in patients with fatal and non-fatal hospitalizations, may be helpful in recognizing patients requiring special medical care and preventive measures during hospitalization.","Kanecki, Krzysztof; Nitsch-Osuch, Aneta; Gorynski, Pawel; Wojtyniak, Bogdan; Juszczyk, Grzegorz; Magdalena, Bogdan; Kosinska, Irena; Tyszko, Piotr",Pol.

METHODS: This multi-center, retrospective cohort study included patients with COVID-19 admitted to four hospitals in Hubei Province, China, from 31 December, 2019 to 31 March, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups according to their exposure to RBV/IFN-&#945; therapy within 48 hours of admission. Mixed-effect Cox model and Logistic regression were used to explore the association between early treatments of RBV/IFN-&#945; with primary outcomes. RESULTS: Of 2037 patients eventually included, 1281 patients received RBV/IFN-&#945; (RBV alone/IFN-&#945; alone/RBV combined with IFN-&#945;) treatments and 756 patients received none of these treatments. In mixed effect model, RBV/IFN-&#945; therapy was not associated with progression from non-severe into severe type (aHR = 1.09, 95%CI: 0.88-1.36) or with reduction in 30-day mortality (aHR = 0.89, 95%CI: 0.61-1.30). However, it was associated with a higher probability of length of hospital stay over 15 days (aOR = 2.11, 95%CI: 1.68-2.64) compared with No RBV/IFN-&#945; therapy. Moreover, the propensity score-matched cohort and subgroup analysis displayed similar results. CONCLUSION: RBV/IFN-&#945; therapy was not observed to any benefit in improving clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19, suggesting that RBV/IFN-&#945; therapy should be avoided in COVID-19 patients.","Li, Hui; Xiong, Nian; Li, Changjun; Gong, Yanhong; Liu, Li; Yang, Heping; Tan, Xiangping; Jiang, Nan; Zong, Qiao; Wang, Jing; Lu, Zuxun; Yin, Xiaoxv",Int. j. infect. dis,505,20

For over 10 years, the National AIDS Program (NAP) has offered HIV voluntary counselling and testing through a partnership with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). In 2018, implementation of HIV self-tests (HIVST) was introduced, and this self-care intervention has been further scaled up during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This paper (1) describes the effectiveness of implementing HIVST in Lebanon, and (2) discusses how the success of HIVST implementation has been reflected during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The NAP conducted a series of workshops (July-November 2018) to introduce HIVST services for healthcare workers working at different NGOs. The workshops highlighted that HIVST would be distributed for free, that it would be confidential and voluntary, and that participants were encouraged to notify the NGOs of their results, which would be kept strictly confidential. NGOs collected data anonymously and confidentially from beneficiaries (age, consistency of condom use and HIV testing history), who were asked to call back with the results of their HIVST. At the NAP, data were combined, aggregated and analysed. RESULTS: In 2019, the NGOs distributed 1103/1380 (79.9%) HIVST kits to their beneficiaries. The NGOs collected feedback on 111 kit results, of which two were HIV-positive. Feedback about HIVST results from beneficiaries was low (111/1103) due to noncompliance of beneficiaries and the lack of human and financial resources in the NGOs. From January through May 2020, a total of 625/780 HIVST kits (80.1%) were distributed. This period was divided into pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19. The follow-up with the beneficiaries during COVID-19 was much improved because of the absence of on-site activities, shifting more efforts towards HIVST (449/625). There have been no reports of social harm related to HIVST. CONCLUSION: HIVST implementation in Lebanon serves as an example of introducing a self-care intervention as part of a community-led effort. In order to maintain HIVST services at the same improved level, reorganization of care is needed within each NGO following the adaptation process due to COVID-19, along with continuous monitoring and evaluation of HIVST reported data.","Maatouk, Ismael; Nakib, Mostafa El; Assi, Moubadda; Farah, Patrick; Makso, Bertho; Nakib, Clara El; Rady, Alissar",Health Res Policy Syst,505,16

Both the livestreams and the newly created coronavirus disease (COVID) verses reflect critical improvisatory approaches to the pandemic in música huasteca. The interactive livestreams signaled an ad hoc community infrastructure facilitated by social media and an emerging community space fostered by Do-It-Yourself (DIY) activists. Improvised COVID-related verses presented resonant local and regional themes as a community response to a global crisis. Digital ethnography conducted since March 2020 revealed a regional burst of musical creativity coupled with DIY intentionality, a leveling of access to virtual community spaces, and enhanced digital intimacies established across a wide cultural diaspora in Mexico and the USA. These responses were musically, poetically, and organizationally improvisational, as was the overall outpouring of the son huasteco music inspired by the coronavirus outbreak. Son huasteco is a folk music tradition from the Huasteca, a geo-cultural region spanning the intersection of six states in central Mexico. This study examines a selection of musical responses by discussing improvisational examples in both Spanish and the indigenous language Nahuatl, and in the virtual musical communities of the Huasteca migrant diaspora in digital events such as ""Encuentro Virtual de Tríos Huastecos,"" the ""Huapangos Sin Fronteras"" festival and competition, and in the nightly gatherings on social media platforms developed during the pandemic to sustain the Huastecan cultural expression. These phenomena have served as vibrant points of transnational connection and identity in a time where physical gatherings were untenable.","Margolies, D. S.; Strub, J. A.",Front Psychol,505,32

Despite obese person mesh fitting being an important problem with numerous applications (e.g., healthcare), much recent progress in mesh recovery has been restricted to images of non-obese people. In this work, we identify this crucial gap in the current literature by presenting and discussing limitations of existing algorithms. Next, we present a simple baseline to address this problem that is scalable and can be easily used in conjunction with existing algorithms to improve their performance. Finally, we present a generalized human mesh optimization algorithm that substantially improves the performance of existing methods on both obese person images as well as community-standard benchmark datasets. A key innovation of this technique is that it does not rely on supervision from expensive-to-create mesh parameters. Instead, starting from widely and cheaply available 2D keypoints annotations, our method automatically generates mesh parameters that can in turn be used to re-train and fine-tune any existing mesh estimation algorithm. This way, we show our method acts as a drop-in to improve the performance of a wide variety of contemporary mesh estimation methods. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets comprising both standard and obese person images and demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed techniques.","Li, Ren; Zheng, Meng; Karanam, Srikrishna; Chen, Terrence; Wu, Ziyan",,505,1

The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was the etiologic agent of this disease, and responsible of the current pandemic of COVID-19. Accumulated evidence on placental features is based most on case-reports and small case-series, with differing results. METHODS: We gathered a cohort of 29 infected pregnant mothers who delivered 32 newborns, and had placentas available for pathologic examination. Placentas were compared with a control group. RESULTS: Of the 29 mothers, clinical and radiological features were similar to what was already described in COVID-19. Pregnancy modified some analytical parameters. One of the mothers succumbed to the disease. Of the 32 newborns, 1 developed an early infection, with positive reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at 48 h of life, with an initial RT-PCR negative. SARS-CoV-2 presence was assessed on placental tissue with immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR, both were negative. All newborns had good clinical outcomes. No differences in morphological placental findings were found among both groups. CONCLUSION: Lack of statistically significant differences among case and control groups suggest that placentas from SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers represent a cohort of normal placentas only submitted because of maternal SARS-CoV-2 status. To the best of our knowledge, no irrefutable cases of vertical transmission have been yet described. Other authors have failed to demonstrate presence of viral RNA in placental tissue. Accumulated knowledge suggests that if vertical transmission is possible, it is a rare event.","Blasco Santana, Luis; Miraval Wong, Eduardo; Álvarez-Troncoso, Jorge; Sánchez García, Laura; Bartha, José L; Regojo-Zapata, Rita M",J Obstet Gynaecol Res,505,17

A server instance protected by shibboleth authentication enabled students and academic staff access remotely even copyright-protected works for the period of the lockdown. Through brief observation of user behaviour in this server instance, the paper explores accessed titles, especially with focus on their copyright status. Design/methodology/approach: Library usage was observed in a branch of a DL, which enabled remote access to copyright-protected documents. Data were obtained from Google Analytics and access logs enriched with metadata. Findings: Academic DL users overwhelmingly preferred titles that are copyright protected, monographs in particular. Their spectrum of interests was wide, and thus, mass digitisation is essential. Originality/value: The paper presents a solution to provide free remote access to library users during closure on a national level. The case study reveals the needs and interests of DL users via a brief analysis of accessed titles and gives grounds for further changes towards a more open remote access DL model, which would be possible within the current copyright restrictions.","Pokorná, Lenka; Indrák, Michal; Grman, Maroš; Stepanovsky, Frantisek; Smetánková, Martina",Digit.

The Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (ECOHIS) measures oral health-related quality of life (OHRQL). The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is an association between ECOHIS scores and surgery wait times for children undergoing dental treatment for S-ECC under general anesthesia (GA). METHODS: The hypothesis was that there is no present association between wait times and ECOHIS score. Children under 72 months of age with S-ECC were recruited on the day of their slated dental surgery under GA. Parents/caregivers completed a questionnaire that included the ECOHIS. Data were merged with other ECOHIS scores from a previous study. Wait times were acquired from the Patient Access Registry Tool (PART) database. Data analysis included descriptive statistics and bivariate analyses. A p-value of &#8804;0.05 was considered statistically significant; 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported for each correlation coefficient. This study was approved by the University of Manitoba's Health Research Ethics Board. RESULTS: Overall, 200 children participated, the majority of whom were Indigenous (63%) and resided in Winnipeg (52.5%). The mean age was 47.6 ± 13.8 months and 50.5% were female. Analyses showed ECOHIS scores were not significantly correlated with children's wait times. Observed correlations between ECOHIS and children's wait times were low and not statistically significant, ranging from &#961; = 0.11 for wait times and child impact section (CIS) scores (95% CI: - 0.04, 0.26; p = 0.14), &#961; = - 0.08 for family impact section (FIS) scores (95% CI: - 0.23, 0.07; p = 0.28), and &#961; = 0.04 for total ECOHIS scores (95% CI: - 0.11, 0.19; p = 0.56). CONCLUSION: No significant associations were observed between ECOHIS scores and wait times. In fact, those with worse OHRQL appeared to wait longer for surgery. ECOHIS scores could, however, still be used to help prioritize children for dental surgery to ensure that they receive timely access to dental care under GA. This is essential given the challenges posed by COVID-19 on timely access to surgical care.","Lee, Victor H K; Grant, Cameron G; Mittermuller, Betty-Anne; Singh, Sarbjeet; Weiss, Brenda; Edwards, Jeanette M; Schroth, Robert J",BMC Oral Health,505,21

In light of COVID-19, it is predicted that as many as 75,000 more people will die from alcohol and other substance use and suicide as a result of isolation, new mental health concerns, and various other stressors related to the pandemic. Public awareness campaigns that aim to destigmatize substance use and help individuals have meaningful conversations with friends, coworkers, or family members to address substance use concerns are a timely and cost-effective means of augmenting existing behavioral health efforts related to substance use. These types of interventions can supplement the work being done by existing public health initiatives. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study examines the impact of the One Degree: Shift the Influence role play simulation, designed to teach family, friends, and coworkers to effectively manage problem-solving conversations with individuals that they are concerned about regarding substance use. METHODS: Participants recruited for this mixed methods study completed a presurvey, the simulation, and a postsurvey, and were sent a 6-week follow-up survey. The simulation involves practicing a role play conversation with a virtual human coded with emotions, a memory, and a personality. A virtual coach provides feedback in using evidence-based communication strategies such as motivational interviewing. RESULTS: A matched sample analysis of variance revealed significant increases at follow-up in composite attitudinal constructs of preparedness (P<.001) and self-efficacy (P=.01), including starting a conversation with someone regarding substance use, avoiding upsetting someone while bringing up concerns, focusing on observable facts, and problem solving. Qualitative data provided further evidence of the simulation's positive impact on the ability to have meaningful conversations about substance use. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence that conversation-based simulations like One Degree: Shift the Influence that use role play practice can teach individuals to use evidence-based communication strategies and can cost-effectively reach geographically dispersed populations to support public health initiatives for primary prevention.","Albright, Glenn; Khalid, Nikita; Shockley, Kristen; Robinson, Kelsey; Hughes, Kevin; Pace-Danley, Bethany",JMIR Form Res,505,26

Herculean efforts to rapidly design and produce vaccines and other antiviral interventions are ongoing. However, newly evolving viral mutations, the prospect of only temporary immunity, and a long path to regulatory approval pose significant challenges and call for a common, readily available, and inexpensive treatment. Strategic drug repurposing combined with rapid testing of established molecular targets could provide a pause in disease progression. SARS-CoV-2 shares extensive structural and functional conservation with SARS-CoV-1, including engagement of the same host cell receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) localized in cholesterol-rich microdomains. These lipid-enveloped viruses encounter the endosomal/lysosomal host compartment in a critical step of infection and maturation. Niemann-Pick type C (NP-C) disease is a rare monogenic neurodegenerative disease caused by deficient efflux of lipids from the late endosome/lysosome (LE/L). The NP-C disease-causing gene (NPC1) has been strongly associated with viral infection, both as a filovirus receptor (e.g., Ebola) and through LE/L lipid trafficking. This suggests that NPC1 inhibitors or NP-C disease mimetics could serve as anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. Fortunately, there are such clinically approved molecules that elicit antiviral activity in preclinical studies, without causing NP-C disease. Inhibition of NPC1 may impair viral SARS-CoV-2 infectivity via several lipid-dependent mechanisms, which disturb the microenvironment optimum for viral infectivity. We suggest that known mechanistic information on NPC1 could be utilized to identify existing and future drugs to treat COVID-19.","Sturley, Stephen L; Rajakumar, Tamayanthi; Hammond, Natalie; Higaki, Katsumi; Márka, Zsuzsa; Márka, Szabolcs; Munkacsi, Andrew B",J Lipid Res,505,20

Months into the pandemic, countries are still scrambling to enact policies that mitigate the outbreak and minimize the strain on their health-care infrastructures and economies. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees continues to work with member states to provide guidance and assistance to those populations protected under their mandate. However, there is great concern regarding the ability to appropriately provide for displaced populations, as they tend to be hosted in areas that lack access to health care and proper hygiene materials. The situation has been exacerbated by the temporary suspension of refugee resettlement across the globe. In the United States, the Trump Administration has responded to the crisis by further eroding refugee and asylum resettlement programs and failing to properly protect the asylum seekers currently being detained. At the local level, resettled refugees and asylees have responded to the unique challenges posed by coronavirus by using their skillsets to provide assistance and services to community members in need. The coronavirus, and the Trump Administration's response, are likely to have long-term negative impacts on refugee resettlement and asylum programs.","Grant, Aubrey",,505,24

None of the studies have reported the outcomes of in-hospital cardiac arrest in coronavirus disease 2019 patients in the United States. We describe the characteristics and outcomes of in-hospital cardiac arrest in coronavirus disease 2019 patients in rural Southwest Georgia. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Single-center, multihospital. PATIENTS: Consecutive coronavirus disease 2019 patients who experienced in-hospital cardiac arrest with attempted resuscitation. INTERVENTIONS: Attempted resuscitation with advanced cardiac life support. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: Out of 1,094 patients hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 during the study period, 63 patients suffered from in-hospital cardiac arrest with attempted resuscitation and were included in this study. The median age was 66 years, and 49.2% were males. The majority of patients were African Americans (90.5%). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (88.9%), obesity (69.8%), diabetes (60.3%), and chronic kidney disease (33.3%). Eighteen patients (28.9%) had a Charlson Comorbidity Index of 0-2. The most common presenting symptoms were shortness of breath (63.5%), fever (52.4%), and cough (46%). The median duration of symptoms prior to admission was 14 days. During hospital course, 66.7% patients developed septic shock, and 84.1% had acute respiratory distress syndrome. Prior to in-hospital cardiac arrest, 81% were on ventilator, 60.3% were on vasopressors, and 39.7% were on dialysis. The majority of in-hospital cardiac arrest (84.1%) occurred in the ICU. Time to initiation of advanced cardiac life support protocol was less than 1 minute for all in-hospital cardiac arrest in the ICU and less than 2 minutes for the remaining patients. The most common initial rhythms were pulseless electrical activity (58.7%) and asystole (33.3%). Although return of spontaneous circulation was achieved in 29% patients, it was brief in all of them. The in-hospital mortality was 100%. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, coronavirus disease 2019 patients suffering from in-hospital cardiac arrest had 100% in-hospital mortality regardless of the baseline comorbidities, presenting illness severity, and location of arrest.","Shah, Priyank; Smith, Hallie; Olarewaju, Ayodeji; Jani, Yash; Cobb, Abigail; Owens, Jack; Moore, Justin; Chenna, Avantika; Hess, David",Crit. care med,505,16

OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the analytical performance of two rapid nucleic acid tests, Cepheid Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 and Mobidiag Novodiag® Covid-19, in comparison to a combination reference of three large-scale PCR tests. Moreover, utility of the Novodiag® test in tertiary care emergency departments was assessed. RESULTS: In the preliminary evaluation, analysis of 90 respiratory samples resulted in 100% specificity and sensitivity for Xpert®, whereas analysis of 107 samples resulted in 93.4% sensitivity and 100% specificity for Novodiag®. Rapid SARS-CoV-2 testing with Novodiag® was made available for four tertiary care emergency departments in Helsinki, Finland between 18 and 31 May, coinciding with a rapidly declining epidemic phase. Altogether 361 respiratory specimens, together with relevant clinical data, were analyzed with Novodiag® and reference tests: 355/361 of the specimens were negative with both methods, and 1/361 was positive in Novodiag® and negative by the reference method. Of the 5 remaining specimens, two were negative with Novodiag®, but positive with the reference method with late Ct values. On average, a test result using Novodiag® was available nearly 8â¯hours earlier than that obtained with the large-scale PCR tests. CONCLUSIONS: While the performance of novel sample-to-answer PCR tests need to be carefully evaluated, they may provide timely and reliable results in detection of SARS-CoV-2 and thus facilitate patient management including effective cohorting.","Jokela, Pia; Jääskeläinen, Anu E; Jarva, Hanna; Holma, Tanja; Ahava, Maarit J; Mannonen, Laura; Lappalainen, Maija; Kurkela, Satu; Loginov, Raisa",J Clin Virol,505,13

In the absence of pharmaceutical interventions such as a vaccine or treatment, non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g. physical or social distancing) are essential to mitigate the pandemic. We develop an original approach to identify the optimal age-stratified control strategy to implement as a function of the time since the onset of the epidemic. This is based on a model with a double continuous structure in terms of host age and time since infection. By applying optimal control theory to this model, we identify a solution that minimizes deaths and costs associated with the implementation of the control strategy itself. We also implement this strategy for three countries with contrasted age distributions (Burkina-Faso, France, and Vietnam). Overall, the optimal strategy varies throughout the epidemic, with a more intense control early on, and depending on host age, with a stronger control for the older population, except in the scenario where the cost associated with the control is low. In the latter scenario, we find strong differences across countries because the control extends to the younger population for France and Vietnam 2 to 3 months after the onset of the epidemic, but not for Burkina Faso.

Furthermore, widespread depression, anxiety, and panic related to SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2) infection affected treatment compliance and recovery. Here we report the successful treatment of a 57-year-old male with severe COVID-19, schizophrenia, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. The patient's negative emotions (such as tension, panic, and anxiety), particularly his aggression and paranoia, seriously hindered treatment, leading to a deteriorating condition. Psychological counseling and supportive psychotherapy were given but the effect was weak. To improve adherence, risperidone and quetiapine fumarate were replaced by olanzapine for anti-schizophrenic treatment to reduce insomnia and anxiety side effects, associated with sedative-hypnotic drugs as well as psychological counseling. The treatment compliance of the patient improved significantly. The patient's serum alanine aminotransferase increased abnormally in the late stage of hospitalization, suggesting potential liver damage after complex medication strategies. We also monitored the changes of lymphocyte subsets and retrospectively analyzed the virus-specific antibody response. The results suggested that dynamic monitoring of lymphocyte subsets and virus-specific antibody response could facilitate disease progression evaluation and timely treatment plan adjustments. An effective psychotropic drug intervention associated with psychological counselling and psychotherapy are essential for the successful adherence, treatment, and rehabilitation of psychiatric disorders in COVID-19 patients.","Zeng, Lizhu; Zhang, Huagen; He, Yongjun; Lai, Bifa; Huang, Zhen; Lin, Li; Zhong, Zhixiong; Guo, Xuemin",Braz J Med Biol Res,505,20

OBJECTIVE: We investigated online search behavior related to the COVID-19 outbreak and the attitudes of ""infodemic monikers"" (ie, erroneous information that gives rise to interpretative mistakes, fake news, episodes of racism, etc) circulating in Italy. METHODS: By using Google Trends to explore the internet search activity related to COVID-19 from January to March 2020, article titles from the most read newspapers and government websites were mined to investigate the attitudes of infodemic monikers circulating across various regions and cities in Italy. Search volume values and average peak comparison (APC) values were used to analyze the results. RESULTS: Keywords such as ""novel coronavirus,"" ""China coronavirus,"" ""COVID-19,"" ""2019-nCOV,"" and ""SARS-COV-2"" were the top infodemic and scientific COVID-19 terms trending in Italy. The top five searches related to health were ""face masks,"" ""amuchina"" (disinfectant), ""symptoms of the novel coronavirus,"" ""health bulletin,"" and ""vaccines for coronavirus."" The regions of Umbria and Basilicata recorded a high number of infodemic monikers (APC weighted total >140). Misinformation was widely circulated in the Campania region, and racism-related information was widespread in Umbria and Basilicata.

Nucleocapsid (N) protein, which is the major structural component of the virion and is involved in viral replication, assembly and immune regulation, plays key roles in the viral life cycle. Here, we solved the crystal structures of the N- and C-terminal domains (N-NTD and N-CTD) of SARS-CoV-2 N protein, at 1.8 and 1.5 Å resolution, respectively. Both structures show conserved features from other CoV N proteins. The binding sites targeted by small molecules against HCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV, which inhibit viral infection by blocking the RNA-binding activity or normal oligomerization of N protein, are relatively conserved in our structure, indicating N protein is a promising drug target. In addition, certain areas of N-NTD and N-CTD display distinct charge distribution patterns in SARS-CoV-2, which may alter the RNA-binding modes. The specific antigenic characteristics are critical for developing specific immune-based rapid diagnostic tests. Our structural information can aid in the discovery and development of antiviral inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 in the future.","Peng, Ya; Du, Ning; Lei, Yuqing; Dorje, Sonam; Qi, Jianxun; Luo, Tingrong; Gao, George F; Song, Hao",EMBO J,505,24

As such, a framework to recommend vaccines and build robust platforms to deliver them to protect the rapidly expanding demographic of older adults is needed. Adult immunization as a strategy has the broad potential to preserve and improve medical, social, and economic outcomes, including maintaining functional ability that benefits older adults, their families, communities, and countries. While we will soon have multiple vaccines against COVID-19, we must recognize that we already have a variety of vaccines against other pathogens that can keep adults healthier. They can prevent simultaneous co-infection with COVID-19, and may favorably impact- the outcome of a COVID-19 illness. Further, administering a vaccine against COVID-19 requires planning now to determine delivery strategies impacting how older adults will be immunized in a timely manner. A group of international experts with various backgrounds from health and aging disciplines met to discuss the evidence case for adult immunization and crucial knowledge gaps that must be filled in order to implement effective policies and programs for older adult immunization. This group, coming together as the International Council on Adult Immunization (ICAI), outlined a high-level roadmap to catalyze action, provide policy guidance, and envision a global adult immunization platform that can be adapted by countries to fit their local contexts. Further meetings centered around the value of adult immunization, particularly in the context of COVID-19. There was agreement that programs to deliver existing influenza, pneumococcal, herpes zoster vaccines, and future COVID-19 vaccines to over a billion older adults who are at substantially higher risk of death and disability due to vaccine-preventable diseases are more urgent than ever before. Here we present a proposed framework for delivering routine and pandemic vaccines.

METHODS: A retrospective review and grading of CXRs in 161 COVID-19 positive patients was caried out in this single centre study. CXR changes primarily constituted that of presence or absence of ground glass opacification (GGO) or consolidation and their distribution across both lung fields. We used two grading systems normal/ mild/ moderate/ severe grading and a numeric 0−8 grading system. We defined mild severity as up to 25 % lung involvement, moderate as 25–62.5 % and severe as 62.5–100% lung involvement. RESULTS: Peripheral GGO in lower +/- mid zones of the lungs is the most common finding. Mid zone and perihilar GGO is associated with increased mortality. We additionally show that CXRs have a higher severity score in the non-survivor group and a CXR graded as severe has a relative risk ratio for mortality of 3.28. Finally, we describe the change in CXR severity with length of symptoms, finding 42.3 % of CXR were normal in the first 2 days of symptoms and 0% at 13 days. CONCLUSION: Using a systematic approach to reviewing and grading CXRs in Covid-19 positive patients we clearly demonstrate that grading, location of airspace abnormalities and rate of CXR changes are related to clinical outcome.","Colman, Jordan; Zamfir, Georgiana; Sheehan, Frances; Berrill, Max; Saikia, Sujoy; Saltissi, Felicity",Eur J Radiol Open,505,20

In Chiapas, Mexico’s southernmost state, the capacity of SAO care is unknown. This study aims to assess the surgical capacity in Chiapas, Mexico, as it relates to access, infrastructure, service delivery, surgical volume, quality, workforce and financial risk protection. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of Ministry of Health public hospitals and private hospitals in Chiapas was performed. The translated Surgical Assessment Tool (SAT) was implemented in sampled hospitals. Surgical volume was collected retrospectively from hospital logbooks. Fisher’s exact test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare public and private hospitals. Catastrophic expenditure from surgical care was calculated. RESULTS: Data were collected from 17 public hospitals and 20 private hospitals in Chiapas. Private hospitals were smaller than public hospitals and public hospitals performed more surgeries per operating room. Not all hospitals reported consistent electricity, running water or oxygen, but private hospitals were more likely to have these basic infrastructure components compared with public hospitals (84% vs 95%; 60% vs 100%; 94.1% vs 100%, respectively). Bellwether surgical procedures performed in private hospitals cost significantly more, and posed a higher risk of catastrophic expenditure, than those performed in public hospitals. CONCLUSION: Capacity limitations are greater in public hospitals compared with private hospitals. However, the cost of care in the private sector is significantly higher than the public sector and may result in catastrophic expenditures. Targeted interventions to improve the infrastructure, workforce availability and data collection are needed.","Roa, Lina; Moeller, Ellie; Fowler, Zachary; Carrillo, Fernando; Mohar, Sebastian; Williams, Wendy; Meara, John G; Riviello, Robert; Uribe-Leitz, Tarsicio; Macias, Valeria",BMJ Open,505,16

During this global health crisis, it is fundamentally crucial to find strategies to combat SARS-CoV-2. Despite several efforts in this direction and continuing clinical trials, no vaccine has been approved for it yet. METHODS: To find a preventive measure, we have computationally designed a multi-epitopic subunit vaccine using immuno-informatic approaches. RESULTS: The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 involved in its survival and pathogenicity were used to predict antigenic epitopes. The antigenic epitopes were capable of eliciting a strong humoral as well as cell-mediated immune response, our predictions suggest. The final vaccine was constructed by joining the all epitopes with specific linkers and to enhance their stability and immunogenicity. The physicochemical property of the vaccine was assessed. The vaccine 3D structure prediction and validation were done and docked with the human TLR-3 receptor. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations of the vaccine-TLR-3 receptor complex are employed to assess its dynamic motions and binding stability in-silico. CONCLUSION: Based on this study, we strongly suggest synthesizing this vaccine, which further can be tested in-vitro and in-vivo to check its potency in a cure for COVID-19.","Kumar, Amit; Kumar, Prateek; Saumya, Kumar Udit; Kapuganti, Shivani K.; Bhardwaj, Taniya; Giri, Rajanish",Expert review of vaccines,505,16

Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is known as the mechanism for severe forms of other coronavirus diseases. The clinical progression of COVID-19 before and after IgG antibody seroconversion was investigated. Methods: Fifty-three patients with reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCT)-confirmed COVID-19 viral pneumonia with or without respiratory failure were retrospectively investigated. The timing of the first IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2-positive date, as well as changes of C-reactive protein (CRP) as an inflammatory marker and blood lymphocyte numbers, was assessed using serial preserved blood samples. Findings: Ten patients recovered without oxygen therapy (mild/moderate group), 32 patients had hypoxemia and recovered with antiviral drugs (severe/non-ICU group), and 11 patients had severe respiratory failure and were treated in the ICU (6 of them died; critical/ICU group). The first IgG-positive date (day 0) was observed from 5 to 18 days from the onset of disease. At day 0, a CRP peak was observed in the severe and critical groups, whereas there was no synchronized CRP peak on day 0 in the mild/moderate group. In the severe/non-ICU group, the blood lymphocyte number increased (P=0.0007) and CRP decreased (P=0.0007) after day 0, whereas CRP did not decrease and the blood lymphocyte number further decreased (P=0.0370) in the critical/ICU group. Interpretation: The respiratory failure due to COVID-19 viral pneumonia observed in week 2 may be related to an antibody-related mechanism rather than uncontrolled viral replication.

The example may ideally regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy, where the epidemic started on February 25, but by no means attempts to perform a rigorous case study in view of the lack of suitable data and uncertainty of the different parameters, namely, the variation of the degree of home isolation and social distancing as a function of time, the number of initially exposed individuals and infected people, the incubation and infection periods and the fatality rate. First, we perform an analysis of the results of the model, by varying the parameters and initial conditions (in order the epidemic to start, there should be at least one exposed or one infected human). Then, we consider the Lombardy case and calibrate the model with the number of dead individuals to date (April 19, 2020) and constraint the parameters on the basis of values reported in the literature. The peak occurs at day 37 (April 1) approximately, when there is a rapid decrease, with a reproduction ratio R0 = 3 initially, 1.38 at day 22 and 0.64 after day 35, indicating different degrees of lockdown. The predicted death toll is almost 14000 casualties, with 2.4 million infected individuals at the end of the epidemic. The incubation period providing a better fit of the dead individuals is 4.25 days and the infection period is 4 days, with a fatality rate of 0.00144/day [values based on the reported (official) number of casualties]. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is 0.57 %, and 2.36 % if twice the reported number of casualties is assumed. However, these rates depend on the initially exposed individuals. If approximately nine times more individuals are exposed, there are three times more infected people at the end of the epidemic and IFR = 0.47 %. If we relax these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infection periods, we observe that a higher incubation period (13 versus 4.25 days) gives the same IFR (0.6 versus 0.57 %), but nine times more exposed individuals in the first case. Therefore, a precise determination of the fatality rate is subject to the knowledge of the characteristics of the epidemic. We plan to perform again these calculations and publish a short note when the epidemic is over and the complete and precise data is available. Besides the specific example, the analysis proposed in this work shows how isolation measures, social distancing and knowledge of the diffusion conditions help us to understand the dynamics of the epidemic. Hence, the importance to quantify the process to verify the effectiveness of the isolation.","Carcione, Jose' M",,505,12

Nevertheless, satisfactory asthma control still remains an unmet need worldwide. Identifying the major determinants of poor control in different asthma severity levels represents the first step towards the improvement of the overall patients’ management. The present review aims to provide an overview of the main unmet needs in asthma control and of the potential tools for overcoming the issue. Implementing a personalized medicine approach is essential, not only in terms of pharmacological treatments, biologic drugs or sophisticated biomarkers. In fact, exploring the complex profile of each patient, from his inflammation phenotype to his preferences and expectations, may help in filling the gap between the big potential of currently available treatments and the overall unsatisfactory asthma control. Telemedicine and e-health technologies may provide a strategy to both optimize disease assessment on a regular basis and enhance patients’ empowerment in managing their asthma. Increasing patients’ awareness as well as the physicians’ knowledge about asthma phenotypes and treatment options besides corticosteroid probably represent the key and more difficult goals of all the players involved in asthma management at every level.","Caminati, Marco; Vaia, Rachele; Furci, Fabiana; Guarnieri, Gabriella; Senna, Gianenrico",J Asthma Allergy,505,20

The study objective was to systematically review evidence on the relationship between health insurance literacy and health care utilization. METHODS: Medline, SCOPUS, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsychInfo, Cochrane Library, and reference lists of published literature were searched in August 2019. Quantitative, qualitative, and intervention studies that assessed the association of health insurance literacy as the exposure and health care utilization as the outcome were identified, without language or date restrictions. Outcomes were independently assessed by 2–3 reviewers. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies including a total of 62,416 subjects met inclusion criteria: three interventional trials, two mixed-methods studies, and sixteen cross-sectional studies. Ten of thirteen preventive care studies suggested that higher health insurance literacy was associated with greater utilization of primary care and other preventive services. Eight of nine studies of care avoidance demonstrated that individuals with lower health insurance literacy were more likely to delay or avoid care. A few studies had mixed results regarding the utilization of emergency department, inpatient, and surgical care. DISCUSSION: The emerging literature in this area suggests that health insurance literacy is an important factor that can enable effective utilization of health care, including primary care and preventive services. However, the literature is limited by a paucity of studies using validated tools that broadly measure health insurance literacy (rather than testing knowledge of specific covered services). Improving health insurance literacy of the general public and increasing plain language communication of health insurance plan features at the point of health care navigation may encourage more effective and cost-conscious utilization.

Examples are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and novel variants of influenza A virus, such as H5N1 and pandemic H1N1. Different animal models are used to develop therapeutic and preventive measures against such viruses, but it is not clear which are most suitable. Therefore, this review compares animal models of SARS and influenza, with an emphasis on non-human primates, ferrets and cats. Firstly, the pathology and pathogenesis of SARS and influenza are compared. Both diseases are similar in that they affect mainly the respiratory tract and cause inflammation and necrosis centred on the pulmonary alveoli and bronchioles. Important differences are the presence of multinucleated giant cells and intra-alveolar fibrosis in SARS and more fulminant necrotizing and haemorrhagic pneumonia in H5N1 influenza. Secondly, the pathology and pathogenesis of SARS and influenza in man and experimental animals are compared. Host species, host age, route of inoculation, location of sampling and timing of sampling are important to design an animal model that most closely mimics human disease. The design of appropriate animal models requires an accurate pathological description of human cases, as well as a good understanding of the effect of experimental variables on disease outcome.","van den Brand, J.M.A.; Haagmans, B.L.; van Riel, D.; Osterhaus, A.D.M.E.; Kuiken, T.",J Comp Pathol,505,21

Design: Publicly available UK government data and clinical evidence on the time between first positive PCR test and death are used to determine the relationships between reported cases and deaths, according to age groups and across regions in England. Main Outcome Measures: Estimates of case fatality rates and their variations over time. Results: Throughout October and November 2020, deaths in England can be broadly understood in terms of CFRs which are approximately constant over time. The same CFRs prove a poor predictor of deaths when applied back to September, when prevalence of the virus was comparatively low, suggesting that the potential effect of false positive tests needs to be taken into account. Similarly, increasing CFRs are needed to match cases to deaths when projecting the model forwards into December. The growth of the S gene dropout VOC in December occurs too late to explain this increase in CFR alone, but at 33% increased mortality, it can explain the peak in deaths in January. On our analysis, if there were other factors responsible for the higher CFRs in December and January, 33% would be an upper bound for the higher mortality of the VOC. From the second half of January, the CFRs for older age groups show a marked decline. Since the fraction of the VOC has not decreased, this decline is likely to be the result of the rollout of vaccination. However, due to the rapidly decreasing nature of the raw cases data (likely due to a combination of vaccination and lockdown), any imprecisions in the time-to-death distribution are greatly exacerbated in this time period, rendering estimates of vaccination effect imprecise. Conclusions: The relationship between cases and deaths, even when controlling for age, is not static through the second wave of coronavirus in England. An apparently anomalous low case-fatality ratio in September can be accounted for by a modest 0.4% false-positive fraction. The large jump in CFR in December can be understood in terms of a more deadly new variant B1.1.7, while a decline in January correlates with vaccine roll-out, suggesting that vaccine reduce the severity of infection, as well as the risk.","Ackland, J.

In addition, PLpro shows significant in vitro deubiquitinating and de-ISGylating activities. All these findings demonstrated the multifunctional nature of the PLpro. Here we report the sensitivity of PLpro to denaturant urea. An increase in urea concentration induced a reversible biphasic unfolding of the enzyme. Differently, the unfolding of the catalytic triad region located within the palm and thumb domains followed a monophasic unfolding curve. Further observations suggest that the zinc-binding domain may start to unfold during the first transition. An 80% lost of its enzymatic activity at a urea concentration lower than 1 M showed a close correlation with unfolding of the zinc-binding domain. The enzyme was also characterized in terms of hydrophobicity and size-and-shape distribution. We have demonstrated that PLpro displayed differential domain structure stability and molten globule state in its folding. These studies will not only assist in our understanding of the folding of this viral enzyme, but also that of other deubiquitinating enzymes with a similar scaffold.","Chou, Ya-Wen; Cheng, Shu-Chun; Lai, Hsing-Yi; Chou, Chi-Yuan",Arch Biochem Biophys,505,5

Thus, it’s pertinent to evaluate various diversified clinical specimens’ diagnostic utility in both diagnosis and follow-up of COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 924 initial specimens from 130 COVID-19 symptomatic cases before initiation of treatment and 665 follow up specimens from 15 randomly selected cases comprising of equal number of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), oropharyngeal swab (OPS), combined NPS and OPS (Combined swab), sputum, plasma, serum and urine were evaluated by rRT-PCR. RESULTS: Demographic analysis showed males (86) twice more affected by COVID-19 than females (44) (p = 0.00001). Combined swabs showed a positivity rate of 100% followed by NPS (91.5%), OPS (72.3%), sputum (63%), while nCoV was found undetected in urine, plasma and serum specimens. The lowest cycle threshold (Ct) values of targeted genes E, ORF1b and RdRP are 10.56, 10.14 and 12.26 respectively and their lowest average Ct values were found in combined swab which indicates high viral load in combined swab among all other specimen types. Analysis of 665 follow-up multi-varied specimens also showed combined swab as the last specimen among all specimen types to become negative, after an average 6.6 (range 4–10) days post-treatment, having lowest (15.48) and average (29.96) Ct values of ORF1b respectively indicating posterior nasopharyngeal tract as primary nCoV afflicted site with high viral load. CONCLUSION: The combined swab may be recommended as a more appropriate specimen for both diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19 treatment by rRT-PCR for assessing virus clearance to help physicians in taking evidence-based decision before discharging patients. Implementing combined swabs globally will definitely help in management and control of the pandemic, as it is the need of the hour.","Sharma, Kuldeep; Aggarwala, Pragya; Gandhi, Deepa; Mathias, Anuniti; Singh, Priyanka; Sharma, Somya; Negi, Sanjay Singh; Bhargava, Anudita; Das, Padma; Gaikwad, Ujjwala; Wankhede, Archana; Behra, Ajoy; Nagarkar, Nitin M.",PLoS One,505,10

This study aimed to determine whether the first prehospital REMS could predict emergency department and hospital dispositions for COVID‐19 patients transported by emergency medical services. METHODS: This retrospective study used linked prehospital and hospital records from the ESO Data Collaborative for all 911‐initiated transports of patients with hospital COVID‐19 diagnoses from July 1 to December 31, 2020. We calculated REMS with the first recorded prehospital values for each component. We calculated area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) for emergency department (ED) mortality, ED discharge, hospital mortality, and hospital length of stay (LOS). We determined optimal REMS cut‐points using test characteristic curves. RESULTS: Among 13,830 included COVID‐19 patients, median REMS was 6 (interquartile range [IQR]: 5‐9). ED mortality was <1% (n = 80). REMS ≥9 predicted ED death (AUROC 0.79). One‐quarter of patients (n = 3,419) were discharged from the ED with an optimal REMS cut‐point of ≤5 (AUROC 0.72). Eighteen percent (n = 1,742) of admitted patients died. REMS ≥8 optimally predicted hospital mortality (AUROC 0.72). Median hospital LOS was 8.3 days (IQR: 4.1‐14.8 days). REMS ≥7 predicted hospitalizations ≥3 days (AUROC 0.62). CONCLUSION: Initial prehospital REMS was modestly predictive of ED and hospital dispositions for patients with COVID‐19. Prediction was stronger for outcomes more proximate to the first set of emergency medical services (EMS) vital signs. These findings highlight the potential value of first prehospital REMS for risk stratification of individual patients and system surveillance for resource planning related to COVID‐19.","Bourn, Scott S.; Crowe, Remle P.; Fernandez, Antonio R.; Matt, Sarah E.; Brown, Andrew L.; Hawthorn, Andrew B.; Myers, J Brent",J Am Coll Emerg Physicians Open,505,20

While real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has performed as the main method for virus detection, other methods are becoming available, including transcription mediated amplification (TMA). The Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay utilizes TMA as a target amplification mechanism, and it has only recently received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). OBJECTIVES: We sought to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay to RTPCR as a means of SARS-CoV-2 detection in a diagnostic setting. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a limit-of-detection study (LoD) to assess the analytical sensitivity of TMA and RT-PCR. This preceded a comparison of the methods using previously evaluated clinical specimens (nasopharyngeal swabs) using 116 human specimens tested by both methodologies. Specimens included sixty-one (61) specimens found reactive by real-time PCR, fifty-one (51) found non-reactive, and four (4) deemed inconclusive. RESULTS: The Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assay showed a markedly higher analytical sensitivity than RT-PCR by LoD study. Evaluation of clinical specimens resulted in fewer inconclusive results by the SARS-CoV-2 assay, leading to potentially higher clinical sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: The higher analytical sensitivity may explain the assay’s ability to ascertain for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genome in human specimens deemed inconclusive by real-time PCR. TMA provides an effective, highly sensitive means of detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal specimens.","Gorzalski, Andrew J.; Tian, Honglin; Laverdure, Chris; Morzunov, Sergey; Verma, Subhash C.; VanHooser, Stephanie; Pandori, Mark W.",J Clin Virol,505,26

Different brief assessment instruments have been developed as efficacy measures of geriatric anxiety in order to overcome psychometric weaknesses of its long form. Among these, the 10-item Geriatric Anxiety Scale (GAS-10) showed strong psychometric properties in community-dwelling samples. However, its diagnostic accuracy is still unexplored, as well as its discriminative power in clinical samples. METHODS: In the present study, we explored the psychometric performance of the GAS-10 in the elderly through Item Response Theory in a sample of 1200 Italian community-dwelling middle-aged and elderly adults (53.8% males, mean age = 65.21 ± 9.19 years). Concurrent validity, as well as diagnostic accuracy, was examined in a non-clinical sample (N = 229; 46.72% males) and clinical sample composed of 35 elderly outpatients (74.28% females) with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). RESULTS: The GAS-10 displayed good internal construct validity, with unidimensional structure and no local dependency, good accuracy, and no signs of Differential Item Functioning (DIF) or measurement bias due to gender, but negligible due to the age. Differences in concurrent validity and diagnostic accuracy among the long form version of the GAS and the GAS-10 were not found significant. The GAS-10 may be more useful than the longer versions in many clinical and research applications, when time constraints or fatigue are issues. CONCLUSION: Using the ROC curve, the GAS-10 showed good discriminant validity in categorizing outpatients with GAD disorder, and high anxiety symptoms as measured by the GAS-SF cut-off. The stable cut-off point provided could enhance the clinical usefulness of the GAS-10, which seems to be a promising valid and reliable tool for maximize diagnostic accuracy of geriatric anxiety symptoms.","Carlucci, Leonardo; Balestrieri, Matteo; Maso, Elisa; Marini, Alessia; Conte, Nadia; Balsamo, Michela",BMC Geriatr,505,1

As previous studies were limited to mathematical modeling or testing on low throughput PCR instruments, this study aimed to assess pooling on high throughput analyzers. To assess the impact of pooling, SARS-CoV-2 dilutions were performed at varying pool depths (i.e. 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8) into test-negative nasopharyngeal or oropharynx/anterior nares swabs matrix. Testing was evaluated on the automated Roche Cobas 6800 system, or the Roche MagNApure LC 2.0 or MagNAPure 96 instruments paired with a laboratory-developed test using a 96-well PCR format. The frequency of detection in specimens with low viral loads was evaluated using archived specimens collected throughout the first pandemic wave. The proportion of detectable results per pool depths was used to estimate the potential impact. In addition, workflow at the analytical stage, and pre-and post-stages of testing were also considered. The current study estimated that pool depths of 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8 would have allowed the detection of 98.3%, 96.0%, and 92.6% of positive SARS-CoV-2 results identified in the first wave of the pandemic in Nova Scotia. Overall, this study demonstrated that pooling on high throughput instrumentation can dramatically increase the overall testing capacity to meet increased demands, with little compromising to sensitivity at low pool depths. However, the human resources required at the pre-analytical stage of testing is a particular challenging to achieve.","LeBlanc, J.

However, patient engagement in using e-SRS for voluntary symptom self-reporting is less optimal. Multiple factors can potentially affect patients’ acceptance and engagement in using home-based e-SRS. However, such factors have not been fully explored in cancer populations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to understand the acceptance and use of home-based e-SRS by patients with cancer and identify associated facilitators and barriers. METHODS: PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, and PsycINFO (January 2010 to March 2020) were searched using a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and keywords such as symptom self-reporting, electronic/technology, cancer, and their synonyms. Included studies focused on the use of home-based e-SRS by patients with cancer and their families. Studies on patients’ use of e-SRS in clinical settings only were excluded. Of the 3740 papers retrieved, 33 were included in the final review. Factors associated with patient acceptance and use of e-SRS were extracted and synthesized. RESULTS: Most e-SRS were web based (22/33, 66%) or mobile app based (9/33, 27%). The e-SRS initial acceptance, represented by patient enrollment rates, ranged from 40% (22/55) to 100% (100/100). High e-SRS acceptance was rated by 69% (59/85) to 77.6% (337/434) of the patients after they used the system. The e-SRS use, measured by patients’ response rates to questionnaires (ranging from 1596/3521, 45.33% to 92%) or system log-on rates (ranging from 4/12, 33% to 99/100, 99%), declined over time in general patterns. Few studies (n=7) reported e-SRS use beyond 6 months, with the response rates ranging from 62% (40/64) to 85.1% (541/636) and the log-on rates ranging from 63.6% (103/162) to 77% (49/64). The availability of compatible devices and technical support, interactive system features, information accessibility, privacy, questionnaire quality, patient physical/psychosocial status, and age were associated with patient acceptance and use of home-based e-SRS. CONCLUSIONS: Acceptance and use of home-based e-SRS by patients with cancer varied significantly across studies, as assessed by a variety of approaches. The lack of access to technology has remained a barrier to e-SRS adoption. Interactive system features and personalized questionnaires may increase patient engagement. More studies are needed to further understand patients’ long-term use of home-based e-SRS behavior patterns to develop personalized interventions to support symptom self-management and self-reporting of patients with cancer for optimal health outcomes.","Cho, Youmin; Zhang, Huiting; Harris, Marcelline Ruth; Gong, Yang; Smith, Ellen Lavoie; Jiang, Yun",J Med Internet Res,505,26

At the onset of the crisis, various interventions were introduced to promote resilience and offer mental support to these professionals. However, it is unknown whether the interventions will meet the needs of professionals as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. The goal of this exploratory study is to gain insight in factors that protect the vitality and resilience of Dutch hospital employees during the so-called ‘second wave’ of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper describes the study protocol. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This exploratory study applies a mixed-methods design, using both quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection and analysis. The first part of the study (substudy I) consists of surveys among doctors and nurses in COVID-19 departments and non-COVID-19 departments, and other professionals in the hospital (ie, managers and homeworkers) in 2020 and 2021. The second part of the study (substudy II) consists of focus groups and interviews among professionals of the intensive care unit, COVID-19 departments and infection prevention units.

However, current directives for safe laundering are limited to healthcare settings and not reflective of domestic conditions. We aimed to use quantitative microbial risk assessment to evaluate household laundering practices (e.g., detergent selection, washing and drying temperatures, and sanitizer use) relative to log10 reductions in pathogens and infection risks during the clothes sorting, washer/dryer loading, folding and storing steps. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using published data, we characterized laundry infection risks for respiratory and enteric pathogens relative to a single user contact scenario and a 1.0 × 10-6 acceptable risk threshold. For respiratory pathogens, risks following cold water wash temperatures (e.g. median 14.4â) and standard detergents ranged from 2.2 × 10-5 to 2.2 × 10-7 . Use of advanced, enzymatic detergents reduced risks to 8.6 × 10-8 and 2.2 × 10-11 respectively. For enteric pathogens, however, hot water, advanced detergents, sanitizing agents and drying are needed to reach risk targets. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Conclusions provide guidance for household laundry practices to achieve targeted risk reductions, given a single user contact scenario. A key finding was that hand hygiene implemented at critical control points in the laundering process was the most significant driver of infection prevention, additionally reducing infection risks by up to 6 log10 .","Reynolds, Kelly A; Verhougstraete, Marc P; Mena, Kristina D; Sattar, Syed A; Scott, Elizabeth A; Gerba, Charles P",J. appl. microbiol,505,18

Febrile patients are typically treated presumptively with antimalarials and/or antibiotics. Such over-prescription can lead to drug resistance and involves unnecessary costs to the health system. International funding for malaria is currently not sufficient to control malaria. Transition to domestic funding is challenged by UHC efforts and recent COVID-19 outbreak. Herewith we present a digital approach to improve efficiencies in diagnosis and treatment of malaria in endemic Kisumu, Kenya: Connected Diagnostics. The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, user experience and clinical performance of this approach in Kisumu. METHODS: Our intervention was performed Oct 2017–Dec 2018 across five private providers in Kisumu. Patients were enrolled on M-TIBA platform, diagnostic test results digitized, and only positive patients were digitally entitled to malaria treatment. Data on socio-demographics, healthcare transactions and medical outcomes were analysed using standard descriptive quantitative statistics. Provider perspectives were gathered by 19 semi-structured interviews. RESULTS: In total 11,689 febrile patients were digitally tested through five private providers. Malaria positivity ranged from 7.4 to 30.2% between providers, significantly more amongst the poor (p < 0.05). Prescription of antimalarials was substantially aberrant from National Guidelines, with 28% over-prescription (4.6–63.3% per provider) and prescription of branded versus generic antimalarials differing amongst facilities and correlating with the socioeconomic status of clients. Challenges were encountered transitioning from microscopy to RDT. CONCLUSION: We provide full proof-of-concept of innovative Connected Diagnostics to use digitized malaria diagnostics to earmark digital entitlements for correct malaria treatment of patients. This approach has large cost-saving and quality improvement potential.

Heating to temperatures above 65 degrees C has been shown to successfully inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus on various surfaces. Ovens or similar heating devices are likely already widely available in hospitals globally. We did a quantitative fit test on nine models of FFP2 and FFP3 respirators before and after heat treatment in an oven. These included both flat fold and moulded cup styles. All passed the initial fit test, and all but two passed the post-treatment fit test. This study demonstrates that FFP respirators can still retain both filtration efficiency and fit after wear and heat treatment, but that it is necessary to understand the probability for failure of fit after decontamination. Heat shows promise as a simple and effective way of treating FFP respirators. Further evaluation of longer-term wear and disinfection effectiveness of heat treatment should be done before widespread use.","Loh, Miranda; Clark, Ross; Cherrie, John W",,505,24

The CovidCalculatorUK is an open-source online tool (covidcalculatoruk.org) that estimates the probability that an individual patient, who presents to a UK hospital, will later test positive for SARS-CoV2. The objective is to aid cohorting decisions and minimise nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV2. MethodsThis n = 500 prospective, observational, multicentre, validation study compared the CovidCalculatorUKs estimated probability of Covid-19 with the first SARS-CoV2 oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal swab result for individual patients admitted to hospital during the study period (01.04.20 - 18.05.20). A comparison with senior clinicians estimates of the probability of Covid-19 was also made. ResultsPatients who were prospectively grouped, by the CovidCalculatorUK, into 0-30% estimated probability, 30-60% and 60-100% estimated probability went on to have first swab SARS-CoV2 positive results in: 15.7%, 30.5% and 61.9% of cases, respectively. CovidCalculatorUK performance demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.76 (95% CI 0.71 - 0.81) (p < 0.001). Senior clinician stratification of the estimated probability of Covid-19 performed similarly to the CovidCalculatorUK. ConclusionThe CovidCalculatorUK provides a reasonably accurate estimate of the probability of an individual testing positive on their first SARS-CoV2 nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab. The CovidCalculatorUK output performs similarly to a senior clinicians estimate. Further evolution of the calculator may improve performance.","Chapman, George A; Mundell, Lewis; Harrison, Charlotte H; Cargill, Tamsin; Keating, Odhran; Johnson, Mark; Smith, Andrew",,505,32

We analyzed the symptoms of SARS-CoV-2, a classification of the Chinese medicine dialectic and treatment regimen, and promptly enacted the recommendation of Korean medicine preparations in herbal medicine covered under domestic medical insurance benefits depending on the circumstances in our country. METHOD: The clinical practice guideline (CPG) for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 was developed based on consensus from a group of experts. RESULTS: Two kinds of herbal medicines (HM) were recommended for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2; Youngyopaedoc-san plus Bojungikgitang, and Youngyopaedoc-san plus Saengmaek-san. Two herbal preparations were recommended for people with a history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2; Youngyopaedoc-san plus Bulhwangeumjeonggi-san, and Youngyopaedoc-san plus Bojungikgi-tang. Three herbal preparations were recommended for mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients; Youngyopaedoc-san plus Galgunhaegui-tang was recommended for those without pneumonia with wind-warmth disease invading the lungs; Sosiho-tang plus Bulhwangeumjeonggi-san was recommended for those with dampness-heat disease in the lungs. For the recovery stage, Samchulkunbi-tang plus Saengmaek-san, or Samchulkunbi-tang plus Chungseuiki-tang was recommended. CONCLUSION: The CPG was developed to guide the use of Korean herbal medicine in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, and it is expected that this will be the basis for providing proper treatment of similar infectious diseases in the future.","Lee, Beom-Joon; Ah Lee, Ju; Kim, Kwan-Il; Choi, Jun-Yong; Jung, Hee-Jae",Integr Med Res,505,16

A total of 2,100 calves were enrolled in the study. Animals were transported for ~1,715 km, from dairies located in Minnesota to a calf raising facility located in New Mexico, where they were housed in individual hutches until weaning. Three days after arrival, calves were randomly allocated into three groups: (1) META1: single subcutaneous (SQ) injection of tildipirosin (Zuprevo™, Merck Animal Health) at enrollment at 4 mg/kg; (2) META2: SQ injection of tildipirosin at enrollment and 17 days later; (3) CON: untreated controls. The BRD incidence was 11.4, 10.8, and 9.4% for calves enrolled in the CON, META1, and META2, respectively (P = 0.44). Lung lesions diagnosed through ultrasonography was found in 21.0, 21.0, and 21.8% of calves enrolled in CON, META1, and META2, respectively (P = 0.99). Mortality tended to be greater for CON calves in comparison to META2 calves (1.5 vs. 0.6%, P = 0.06), but did not differ between calves enrolled in CON and META1 groups (1.5 vs. 1.2%, P = 0.55). Growth was not affected by metaphylaxis. The average daily gain for calves enrolled in CON, META1, and META2 was 517, 518 and 525 g, respectively (P = 0.25). Blood analysis revealed that some of the markers of inflammation assessed were influenced by metaphylaxis. At 27 days after enrollment, META2 calves had decreased concentrations of haptoglobin, serum amyloid A, and aspartate aminotransferase, compared to CON calves (P < 0.05). Additionally, CON calves had increased concentrations of globulins and lower albumin to globulin ratio than META2 calves at the end of the weaning period (P < 0.05). In conclusion, tildipirosin metaphylaxis did not decrease the incidence of BRD nor did it have an impact on weight gain. However, metaphylaxis with two injections of tildipirosin at enrollment and 17 days later tended to reduce mortality and improved the systemic inflammatory status of calves during the preweaning period.","Celestino, Maria Luiza; Fernandes, Leticia; Menta, Paulo Roberto; Paiva, Daniela; Ribeiro, Thiago Lauro; Silva, Thiago; Bilby, Todd R.; Neves, Rafael C.; Ballou, Michael A.; Machado, Vinicius S.",Front Vet Sci,505,20

To date, treatment using inhaled antifungal agents has been limited to repurposing available systemic medicines. PC945 is a novel triazole antifungal agent, a potent inhibitor of CYP51, purpose-designed to be administered via inhalation for high local lung concentrations and limited systemic exposure. In preclinical testing, PC945 is potent versus Aspergillus spp. and Candida spp. and showed two remarkable properties in preclinical studies, in vitro and in vivo. The antifungal effects against Aspergillus fumigatus accumulate on repeat dosing and improved efficacy has been demonstrated when PC945 is dosed in combination with systemic anti-fungal agents of multiple classes. Resistance to PC945 has been induced in Aspergillus fumigatus in vitro, resulting in a strain which remained susceptible to other antifungal triazoles. In healthy volunteers and asthmatics, nebulised PC945 was well tolerated, with limited systemic exposure and an apparently long lung residency time. In two lung transplant patients, PC945 treated an invasive pulmonary Aspergillus infection that had been unresponsive to multiple antifungal agents (systemic ± inhaled) without systemic side effects or detected drug–drug interactions.","Murray, Alison; Cass, Lindsey; Ito, Kazuhiro; Pagani, Nicole; Armstrong-James, Darius; Dalal, Paras; Reed, Anna; Strong, Pete",J Fungi (Basel),505,21

The therapeutic potential of plant-based natural compounds for control of HPV- associated cancers has been also widely explored. Genetic vaccines for HPV-associated tumors that include plant protein-encoding gene sequences, used alone or in combinations with plant metabolites, are being investigated but are still in their infancy. Main focus of this paper is to provide an overview of the current state of novel therapeutic strategies employing genetic vaccines along with plant-derived compounds and genes. We highlight the importance of multimodality treatment regimen such as combining immunotherapy with plant-derived agents. ABSTRACT: Antigen-specific immunotherapy and, in particular, DNA vaccination provides an established approach for tackling human papillomavirus (HPV) cancers at different stages. DNA vaccines are stable and have a cost-effective production. Their intrinsic low immunogenicity has been improved by several strategies with some success, including fusion of HPV antigens with plant gene sequences. Another approach for the control of HPV cancers is the use of natural immunomodulatory agents like those derived from plants, that are able to interfere in carcinogenesis by modulating many different cellular pathways and, in some instances, to reduce chemo- and radiotherapy resistance of tumors. Indeed, plant-derived compounds represent, in many cases, an abundantly available, cost-effective source of molecules that can be either harvested directly in nature or obtained from plant cell cultures. In this review, an overview of the most relevant data reported in literature on the use of plant natural compounds and genetic vaccines that include plant-derived sequences against HPV tumors is provided. The purpose is also to highlight the still under-explored potential of multimodal treatments implying DNA vaccination along with plant-derived agents.","Franconi, Rosella; Massa, Silvia; Paolini, Francesca; Vici, Patrizia; Venuti, Aldo",Cancers (Basel),505,30

Pooling is most advantageous in populations with low infection (positivity) rates, but is expected to remain better than non-pooled testing in populations with infection rates up to 30%. For populations with infection rates lower than 10%, additional testing efficiency may be realized by performing a second round of pooling to test all the samples in the positive first-round pools. The present predictions are validated by recent COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pooled testing and detection sensitivity measurements performed using non-optimal pool sizes, and quantify the additional improvement in testing efficiency that could have been obtained using optimal pooling. Although large pools are most advantageous for testing populations with very low infection rates, they are predicted to become highly non-optimal with increasing infection rate, while pool sizes smaller than 10 remain near-optimal over a broader range of infection rates.","Ben-Amotz, Dor",Epidemics,505,20

Previous research demonstrates that for-profit nursing homes deliver inferior care across a variety of outcome and process measures, raising the question of whether for-profit homes have had worse COVID-19 outcomes than non-profit homes. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all nursing homes in Ontario, Canada from March 29-May 20, 2020 using a COVID-19 outbreak database maintained by the Ontario Ministry of Long-Term Care. We used hierarchical logistic and count-based methods to model the associations between nursing home profit status (for-profit, non-profit or municipal) and nursing home COVID-19 outbreaks, COVID-19 outbreak sizes, and COVID-19 resident deaths. Results: The analysis included all 623 Ontario nursing homes, of which 360 (57.7%) were for-profit, 162 (26.0%) were non-profit, and 101 (16.2%) were municipal homes. There were 190 (30.5%) COVID-19 nursing home outbreaks involving 5218 residents (mean of 27.5 +/- 41.3 residents per home), resulting in 1452 deaths (mean of 7.6 +/- 12.7 residents per home) with an overall case fatality rate of 27.8%. The odds of a COVID-19 outbreak was associated with the incidence of COVID-19 in the health region surrounding a nursing home (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-3.09) and number of beds (aOR, 1.40; 95% CI 1.20-1.63), but not profit status. For-profit status was associated with both the size of a nursing home outbreak (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 1.96; 95% CI 1.26-3.05) and the number of resident deaths (aRR, 1.78; 95% CI 1.03-3.07), compared to non-profit homes. These associations were mediated by a higher prevalence of older nursing home design standards in for-profit homes. Interpretation: For-profit status is associated with the size of a COVID-19 nursing home outbreak and the number of resident deaths, but not the likelihood of outbreaks. Differences between for profit and non-profit homes are largely explained by older design standards, which should be a focus of infection control efforts and future policy.","Stall, N.

It has been used for the prevention and treatment of virus-related respiratory diseases such as influenza virus infection. BLG contains some antiviral compounds, but few evidence-based clinical studies have been conducted to assess its efficacy against influenza. We assessed the effects of BLG (including efficacy and safety) on the treatment of seasonal influenza in an evidence-based clinical trial. METHODS/DESIGN: We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, oseltamivir- and placebo-controlled, parallel-design clinical trial. A total of 177 subjects are going to be recruited after satisfying the criteria: (i) 18 to 65 years of age; (ii) illness onset within 36 h; (3) axillary temperature ≥38.0°C; and (iv) positive influenza (type A/B) virus test. Subjects will be assigned randomly into three groups in equal proportions: oseltamivir treatment, BLG granule treatment, and placebo treatment. Each group receives 5-day treatment and is followed up 1, 3, 5, 7 and 21 days later. Symptoms and patient compliance are recorded, and virus/serum viral antibodies tested. We will use the primary outcome, secondary outcome, and safety indicators to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BLG granules in the treatment of seasonal influenza. DISCUSSION: We have described the first clinical trial for treatment using a single herb against influenza A and B viruses in China. We will hold a large-scale clinical trial to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and safety of BLG against influenza infection based on the results of this pilot study.

Nucleic acid amplification testing or gene sequencing can serve as pathogenic evidence of COVID-19 diagnosing for clinically suspected cases, and dynamic monitoring of specific antibodies (IgM, IgA, and IgG) is an effective complement for false-negative detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. Antigen tests to identify SARS-CoV-2 are recommended in the first week of infection, which is associated with high viral loads. Additionally, many clinical laboratory indicators are abnormal as the disease evolves. For example, from moderate to severe and critical cases, leukocytes, neutrophils, and the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio increase; conversely, lymphocytes decrease progressively but are over activated. LDH, AST, ALT, CK, high-sensitivity troponin I, and urea also increase progressively, and increased D-dimer is an indicator of severe disease and an independent risk factor for death. Severe infection leads to aggravation of inflammation. Inflammatory biomarkers and cytokines, such as CRP, SAA, ferritin, IL-6, and TNF-α, increased gradually. High-risk COVID-19 patients with severe disease, such as the elderly and those with underlying diseases (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, obesity, and cancer), should be monitored dynamically, which will be helpful as an early warning of serious diseases.","Zhufeng, Chen; Wanju, Xu; Wanshan, Ma; Xiaohong, Shi; Shuomin, Li; Mingju, Hao; Yuanxun, Fang; Li, Zhang",Clin Chim Acta,505,2

Watchful waiting is an acceptable option in low-risk patients. Evidence is uncertain in postponing surgery, but conservative estimates suggest delays of over 5 months, 4 months, and 30 days for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients, respectively, can lead to worse survival outcomes. Neoadjuvant therapy can shrink the tumours prior to surgery and can be a useful adjunct in delaying surgery for, at the most, 3 months. ABSTRACT: External factors, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), can lead to cancellations and backlogs of cancer surgeries. The effects of these delays are unclear. This study summarised the evidence surrounding expectant management, delay radical prostatectomy (RP), and neoadjuvant hormone therapy (NHT) compared to immediate RP. MEDLINE and EMBASE was searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised controlled studies pertaining to the review question. Risks of biases (RoB) were evaluated using the RoB 2.0 tool and the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. A total of 57 studies were included. Meta-analysis of four RCTs found overall survival and cancer-specific survival were significantly worsened amongst intermediate-risk patients undergoing active monitoring, observation, or watchful waiting but not in low- and high-risk patients. Evidence from 33 observational studies comparing delayed RP and immediate RP is contradictory.

We previously demonstrated that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV S protein is a major target of neutralizing antibodies. This suggests that the RBD may serve as an ideal vaccine candidate. Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) has been proven to be an effective system for gene delivery and vaccine development. In this study, a novel vaccine against SARS-CoV was developed based on the rAAV delivery system. The gene encoding RBD was cloned into a pAAV-IRES-hrGFP plasmid. The immunogenicity induced by the resulting recombinant RBD-rAAV was evaluated in BALB/c mice. The results demonstrated that (1) a single dose of RBD-rAAV vaccination could induce sufficient neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV infection; (2) two more repeated doses of the vaccination boosted the neutralizing antibody to about 5 times of the level achieved by a single dose of the immunization and (3) the level of the antibody continued to increase for the entire duration of the experiment of 5.5 months. These results suggested that RBD-rAAV is a promising SARS candidate vaccine.","Du, Lanying; He, Yuxian; Wang, Yijia; Zhang, Haojie; Ma, Selene; Wong, Charlotte K.L.; Wu, Sharon H.W.; Ng, Fai; Huang, Jian-Dong; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Jiang, Shibo; Zhou, Yusen; Zheng, Bo-Jian",Virology,505,10

Prospective serologic studies may allow seroincidence analyses, where all infections are accurately identified. Because of this, we evaluated the incidence of and associated factors with SARS-CoV-2 infection in PLWH in Southern Spain. MethodsThis was a prospective cohort study including PLWH from a University Hospital in Southern Spain. Patients were enrolled if 1) they had attended as outpatients our Unit from August 1st, 2019 to February 8th, 2020; 2) had two subsequent evaluations from February 9th, 2020 to February 15th, 2021. Serum antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were determined in baseline and intra-pandemic samples. Results710 PLWH were included in the study. Of them, 46 [6.5%, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 4.8%-8.5%] patients developed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Between May 18th and November 29th, 2020, the rate of seroconversion was 5.3% (95% CI: 3.1%-9%) for the general population in the area of Seville and 2.3% (95% CI: 1.3%-3.6%) for PLWH in this study (p=0.001). After multivariate analysis, adjusted by age and sex, active tobacco smoking was the only factor independently associated with lower risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection (Incidence rate ratio 0.35, 95% CI: 0.18-0.68, p=0.002). ConclusionsThe incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among PLWH in Southern Spain during the ongoing pandemic was lower than that reported for the general population in the same area. Tobacco smoking was the only factor independently associated with a lower risk of incident SARS-CoV-2 infection. SummaryThe incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among people living with HIV is lower than that of general population in Southern Spain.

As fast as the virus spread, it became evident that COVID‐19 is a multi‐system disease, that may involve multiple organs, and has a high risk of thrombosis, associated with striking elevations in pro‐inflammatory cytokines, D‐dimer and fibrinogen, but without disseminated intravascular coagulation. Postmortem studies have confirmed the high incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), but also notably revealed diffuse microvascular thrombi with endothelial swelling, consistent with a thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), and inter‐alveolar endothelial deposits of complement activation fragments. The clinicopathologic presentation of COVID‐19 thus parallels that of other thrombotic diseases, such as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), that are caused by dysregulation of the complement system. This raises the specter that many of the thrombotic complications arising from SARS‐CoV‐2 infections may be triggered and/or exacerbated by excess complement activation. This is of major potential clinical relevance, as currently available anti‐complement therapies that are highly effective in protecting against thrombosis in aHUS, could be efficacious in COVID‐19. In this review, we provide mounting evidence for complement participating in the pathophysiology underlying the thrombotic diathesis associated with pathogenic coronaviruses, including SARS‐CoV‐2. Based on current knowledge of complement, coagulation and the virus, we suggest lines of study to identify novel therapeutic targets and the rationale for clinical trials with currently available anti‐complement agents for COVID‐19.","Conway, Edward M.; Pryzdial, Edward L.G.",J Thromb Haemost,505,16

Evidence from animal models shows that T cells can provide heterosubtypic protection and are crucial for immune control of influenza virus infections. This has provided hope for the design of a universal vaccine able to prime against diverse influenza virus strains and subtypes. However, multiple hurdles exist for the realisation of a universal T cell vaccine. Overall primary concerns are: extrapolating human clinical studies, seeding durable effective T cell resident memory (Trm), population human leucocyte antigen (HLA) coverage, and the potential for T cell-mediated immune escape. Further comprehensive human clinical data is needed during natural infection to validate the protective role T cells play during infection in the absence of antibodies. Furthermore, fundamental questions still exist regarding the site, longevity and duration, quantity, and phenotype of T cells needed for optimal protection. Standardised experimental methods, and eventually simplified commercial assays, to assess peripheral influenza-specific T cell responses are needed for larger-scale clinical studies of T cells as a correlate of protection against influenza infection. The design and implementation of a T cell-inducing vaccine will require a consensus on the level of protection acceptable in the community, which may not provide sterilizing immunity but could protect the individual from severe disease, reduce the length of infection, and potentially reduce transmission in the community. Therefore, increasing the standard of care potentially offered by T cell vaccines should be considered in the context of pandemic preparedness and zoonotic infections, and in combination with improved antibody vaccine targeting methods. Current pandemic vaccine preparedness measures and ongoing clinical trials under-utilise T cell-inducing vaccines, reflecting the myriad questions that remain about how, when, where, and which T cells are needed to fight influenza virus infection. This review aims to bring together basic fundamentals of T cell biology with human clinical data, which need to be considered for the implementation of a universal vaccine against influenza that harnesses the power of T cells.","Clemens, E.

Fifteen semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with outpatient caregivers working in Northern Germany in the period May–June 2020. Interviews were analyzed by using qualitative content analysis. Outpatient caregivers experienced daily mask obligation, lack of personal protection equipment (PPE) and stricter hygiene regulations as demanding during the pandemic. They also described a higher workload and emotional demands such as fear of infection or infecting others. They perceived team spirit and communication as important work-related resources. Depressive symptoms and feelings of stress were described as strain reactions.

This phase coincided with a transient change in systemic immune activation. Even after the alleged resolution of the infection, computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET)-CT revealed pulmonary lesions and activated tracheobronchial lymph nodes in all animals. Post-mortem histological examination of the lung tissue revealed mostly marginal or resolving minimal lesions that were indicative of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The present study aimed to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in a large cohort of cancer patients. Design, Setting, and Participants: Data of consecutive cancer patients admitted to 33 designated hospitals for COVID-19 in Hubei province, China from December 17, 2019 to March 18, 2020 were retrospectively collected. The follow-up cutoff date was April 02, 2020. The clinical course and survival status of the cancer patients with COVID-19 were measured, and the potential risk factors of severe events and death were assessed through univariable and multivariable analyses. Results: A total of 283 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients (50% male; median age, 63.0 years [IQR, 55.0 to 70.0]) with more than 20 cancer types were included. The overall mortality rate was 18% (50/283), and the median hospitalization stay for the survivors was 26 days. Amongst all, 76 (27%) were former cancer patients with curative resections for over five years without recurrence. The current cancer patients exhibited worse outcomes versus former cancer patients (overall survival, HR=2.45, 95%CI 1.10 to 5.44, log-rank p=0.02; mortality rate, 21% vs 9%). Of the 207 current cancer patients, 95 (46%) have received recent anti-tumor treatment, and the highest mortality rate was observed in the patients receiving recent chemotherapy (33%), followed by surgery (26%), other anti-tumor treatments (19%), and no anti-tumor treatment (15%). In addition, a higher mortality rate was observed in patients with lymphohematopoietic malignancies (LHM) (53%, 9/17), and all seven LHM patients with recent chemotherapy died. Multivariable analysis indicated that LHM (p=0.001) was one of the independent factors associating with critical illness or death. Conclusions: This is the first systematic study comprehensively depicting COVID-19 in a large cancer cohort. Patients with tumors, especially LHM, may have poorer prognosis of COVID-19.

In Part A, 1013 subjects were randomized into four treatment groups (5 μg, 15 μg, or 45 μg hemagglutinin [HA] VLP vaccine or placebo) and vaccinated 21 days apart, with sera collected on Days 1, 14 and 36 for hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) testing. After review of safety and immunogenicity data from Part A, additional subjects were immunized with a single dose of 15 μg VLP vaccine (N = 2537) or placebo (N = 1011) and assessed for safety in Part B. Results showed the H1N1 2009 VLP vaccine was safe and well-tolerated. Systemic solicited events were similar between placebo and VLP vaccinated groups with no vaccine-related serious adverse events. Dose response trends for solicited local adverse events were observed, with higher incidences of local pain, swelling, tenderness, and redness reported in the higher VLP dose groups (15 μg and 45 μg) compared to the placebo and 5 μg VLP groups following both vaccinations. Although the majority of local AEs were mild in severity, a dose trend in events of moderate or greater severity was also noted for these solicited events. The VLP vaccine groups demonstrated robust HAI immune responses after a single vaccination, with high rates of seroprotection (≥40 HAI titer) in 82–92% of all subjects and in 64–85% of subjects who were seronegative at the time of immunization. HAI geometric mean titers (GMTs), geometric mean ratios (GMRs) and seroconversion rates were also all statistically higher in the VLP groups compared to placebo for both post-baseline time points.

In COVID-19, pathogenic myeloid cell overactivation is found to be a vital mediator of damage to tissues, hypercoagulability, and the cytokine storm. These cytokines unselectively infiltrate various tissues, such as the lungs and heart, and nervous system. This cytokine storm can hence cause multi-organ dysfunction and life-threatening complications. Mavrilimumab is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that may be helpful in some cases with COVID-19. During an inflammation, Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) release is crucial to driving both innate and adaptive immune responses. The GM-CSF immune response is triggered when an antigen attaches to the host cell and induces the signaling pathway. Mavrilimumab antagonizes the action of GM-CSF and decreases the hyperinflammation associated with pneumonia in COVID-19, therefore strengthening the rationale that mavrilimumab when added to the standard protocol of treatment could improve the clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients, specifically those patients with pneumonia.

STUDY DESIGN: Respiratory virus proficiency panels were produced from diluted stocks of respiratory viruses provided and tested by four reference laboratories. The panels consisted of strong positive, positive, low positive and negative samples for influenza viruses A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses 1 and 3, adenovirus serotypes 4 and 7, human rhinovirus serotypes 16, 72 and 90, human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E. The panels were sent to 17 participants; results and information on methodology was collected. RESULTS: All laboratories returned results, of which five submitted complete data sets. So, for analysis all results were combined. Samples were correctly identified by participants in 93.75%, 76.75% and 47.03% for the high positive, positive and low positive samples, respectively. One false positive was reported for all data sets (1.1%). The overall score for all assays using different methodologies was 78.8%. Laboratory performance was not dependant on methodology as all in-house methodologies could achieve optimal results, but dependant on careful optimisation and procedures specific to the laboratory. CONCLUSIONS: The first proficiency panel showed that in general all participants performed well. Although, it also highlights areas for improvement for all participants in order to generate robust results for use in clinical diagnostics.","Templeton, K.E.; Forde, C.B.; Loon, A.M. van; Claas, E.C.J.; Niesters, H.G.M.; Wallace, P.; Carman, W.F.",J Clin Virol,505,24

The observed problems with the efficiency of the vaccination campaigns in numerous countries around the world, as well as the approach used at the initial stage of the National Immunization Program in Poland, prompted us to analyse the possibility of using GIS technology to optimize the distribution of vaccines to vaccination sites so as to minimize the period needed to vaccinate individual population groups. The research work was carried out on the example of Warsaw, the capital of Poland and the city with the largest population in the country. The analyses were carried out for the 60–70 and 50–60 age groups, in various approaches and for vaccines of different companies (Moderna, BioNTech, AstraZeneca), used to vaccinate people in Poland. The proposed approach to optimize vaccine distribution uses Thiessen’s tessellation to obtain information on the number of people in a given population group living in the area of each vaccination site, and then to estimate the time needed to vaccinate that group. Compared to the originally used vaccination scenario with limited availability of vaccines, the proposed approach allows practitioners to design fast and efficient distribution scenarios. With the developed methodology, we demonstrated ways to achieve uniform vaccination coverage throughout the city. We anticipate that the proposed approach can be easily automated and broadly applied to various urban settings.","Krzysztofowicz, Sylwia; Osińska-Skotak, Katarzyna",Int J Environ Res Public Health,505,20

Routine infection control practices augmented by airborne precautions are paramount when treating the COVID-19 positive patient. Best practices for PPE use in patients who have unknown COVID-19 status are a highly charged and emotional issue. The variables to be considered include protection of patients and healthcare providers, accuracy and availability of testing, and responsible use of PPE resources.

As an example of a proteolytic system, the complement system plays a significant role in glomerular inflammatory kidney disease and is currently under clinical investigation. Based on two glomerular kidney diseases, lupus nephritis, and membranous nephropathy, we portrait two proteolytic pathomechanisms and the role of the complement system. We discuss how profiling proteolytic activity in patient samples could be used to stratify patients for more targeted interventions in inflammatory kidney diseases. We also describe novel comprehensive, quantitative tools to investigate the entirety of proteolytic processes in a tissue sample. Emphasis is placed on mass spectrometric approaches that enable the comprehensive analysis of the complement system, as well as protease activities and regulation in general.","Demir, Fatih; Troldborg, Anne; Thiel, Steffen; Lassé, Moritz; Huesgen, Pitter F.; Tomas, Nicola M.; Wiech, Thorsten; Rinschen, Markus M.",Cell Tissue Res,505,10

It remains unknown how the immune response in children differs from that of adolescents and adults. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of age with the quantity and quality of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used 31 426 SARS-CoV-2 antibody test results from pediatric and adult patients. Data were collected from a New York City hospital from April 9 to August 31, 2020. The semiquantitative immunoglobin (Ig) G levels were compared between 85 pediatric and 3648 adult patients. Further analysis of SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiles was performed on sera from 126 patients aged 1 to 24 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity rates and IgG levels were evaluated in patients from a wide range of age groups (1-102 years). SARS-CoV-2 IgG level, total antibody (TAb) level, surrogate neutralizing antibody (SNAb) activity, and antibody binding avidity were compared between children (aged 1-10 years), adolescents (aged 11-18 years), and young adults (aged 19-24 years). RESULTS: Among 31 426 antibody test results (19 797 [63.0%] female patients), with 1194 pediatric patients (mean [SD] age, 11.0 [5.3] years) and 30 232 adult patients (mean [SD] age, 49.2 [17.1] years), the seroprevalence in the pediatric (197 [16.5%; 95% CI, 14.4%-18.7%]) and adult (5630 [18.6%; 95% CI, 18.2%-19.1%]) patient populations was similar. The SARS-CoV-2 IgG level showed a negative correlation with age in the pediatric population (r = −0.45, P < .001) and a moderate but positive correlation with age in adults (r = 0.24, P < .001). Patients aged 19 to 30 years exhibited the lowest IgG levels (eg, aged 25-30 years vs 1-10 years: 99 [44-180] relative fluorescence units [RFU] vs 443 [188-851] RFU). In the subset cohort aged 1 to 24 years, IgG, TAb, SNAb and avidity were negatively correlated with age (eg, IgG: r = −0.51; P < .001). Children exhibited higher median (IQR) IgG levels, TAb levels, and SNAb activity compared with adolescents (eg, IgG levels: 473 [233-656] RFU vs 191 [82-349] RFU; P < .001) and young adults (eg, IgG levels: 473 [233-656] RFU vs 85 [38-150] RFU; P < .001). Adolescents also exhibited higher median (IQR) TAb levels, IgG levels, and SNAb activity than young adults (eg, TAb levels: 961 [290-2074] RFU vs 370 [125-697]; P = .006). In addition, children had higher antibody binding avidity compared with young adults, but the difference was not significant. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this study suggest that SARS-CoV-2 viral specific antibody response profiles are distinct in different age groups. Age-targeted strategies for disease screening and management as well as vaccine development may be warranted.","Yang, He S.; Costa, Victoria; Racine-Brzostek, Sabrina E.; Acker, Karen P.; Yee, Jim; Chen, Zhengming; Karbaschi, Mohsen; Zuk, Robert; Rand, Sophie; Sukhu, Ashley; Klasse, P.

Anticoronavirus therapy is however challenging, as coronaviruses are biologically diverse and rapidly mutating. In this work, the antiviral activity of seven different carbon quantum dots (CQDs) for the treatment of human coronavirus HCoV-229E infections was investigated. The first generation of antiviral CQDs was derived from hydrothermal carbonization of ethylenediamine/citric acid as carbon precursors and postmodified with boronic acid ligands. These nanostructures showed a concentration-dependent virus inactivation with an estimated EC(50) of 52 ± 8 μg mL(–1). CQDs derived from 4-aminophenylboronic acid without any further modification resulted in the second-generation of anti-HCoV nanomaterials with an EC(50) lowered to 5.2 ± 0.7 μg mL(–1). The underlying mechanism of action of these CQDs was revealed to be inhibition of HCoV-229E entry that could be due to interaction of the functional groups of the CQDs with HCoV-229E entry receptors; surprisingly, an equally large inhibition activity was observed at the viral replication step.","Łoczechin, Aleksandra; Séron, Karin; Barras, Alexandre; Giovanelli, Emerson; Belouzard, Sandrine; Chen, Yen-Ting; Metzler-Nolte, Nils; Boukherroub, Rabah; Dubuisson, Jean; Szunerits, Sabine",ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces,505,10

Effective antiviral therapy is important for tackling these patients. We assessed the efficacy and safety of favipiravir for treating these patients. Methods This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial in SARS-CoV-2 RNA re-positive patients. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either favipiravir, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone. The primary outcome was time to achieve a consecutive twice (at intervals of more than 24 hours) negative RT-PCR result for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swab and sputum sample. Results Between March 27 and May 9 2020, 55 patients underwent randomization; 36 were assigned to the favipiravir group and 19 were assigned to the control group. Favipiravir group had a significantly shorter time from start of study treatment to negative nasopharyngeal swab and sputum than control group (median 17 vs. 26 days); hazard ratio 2.1 (95% CI [1.1 - 4.0], p=0.038). The proportion of virus shedding in favipiravir group was higher than control group (80.6% [29/36] vs. 52.6% [10/19], p=0.030, respectively). C-reactive protein decreased significantly after treatment in the favipiravir group (p=0.016). The adverse events were generally mild and self-limiting. Conclusion Favipiravir was safe and superior to control in shortening the duration of viral shedding in SARS-CoV-2 RNA recurrent positive after discharge.

The aim of the present study was to examine death certificates of persons who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to (a) quantify the number of deaths directly caused by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19); (b) estimate the most common complications leading to death; and (c) identify the most common comorbidities. Methods: Death certificates of persons who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 provided to the National Surveillance system were coded according to the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases. Deaths due to COVID-19 were defined as those in which COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death. Complications were defined as those conditions reported as originating from COVID-19, and comorbidities were conditions independent of COVID-19. Results: A total of 5311 death certificates of persons dying in March through May 2020 were analysed (16.7% of total deaths). COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death in 88% of cases. Pneumonia and respiratory failure were the most common complications, being identified in 78% and 54% of certificates, respectively. Other complications, including shock, respiratory distress and pulmonary oedema, and heart complications demonstrated a low prevalence, but they were more commonly observed in the 30–59 years age group. Comorbidities were reported in 72% of certificates, with little variation by age and gender. The most common comorbidities were hypertensive heart disease, diabetes, ischaemic heart disease, and neoplasms. Neoplasms and obesity were the main comorbidities among younger people. Discussion: In most persons dying after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 was the cause directly leading to death. In a large proportion of death certificates, no comorbidities were reported, suggesting that this condition can be fatal in healthy persons. Respiratory complications were common, but non-respiratory complications were also observed.","Grippo, Francesco; Navarra, Simone; Orsi, Chiara; Manno, Valerio; Grande, Enrico; Crialesi, Roberta; Frova, Luisa; Marchetti, Stefano; Pappagallo, Marilena; Simeoni, Silvia; Di Pasquale, Lucilla; Carinci, Annamaria; Donfrancesco, Chiara; Lo Noce, Cinzia; Palmieri, Luigi; Onder, Graziano; Minelli, Giada",J Clin Med,505,2

Here, we describe a single-cycle influenza virus-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine designated as scPR8-RBD-M2. The vaccine utilizes the chimeric gene encoding 2A peptide-based bicistronic protein cassette of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and influenza matrix 2 (M2) protein. The C-terminus of the RBD was designed to link with the cytoplasmic domain of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) to anchor the RBD on the surface of producing cells and virus envelope. The chimeric RBD-M2 gene was incorporated in place of the HA open-reading frame (ORF) between the 3′ and 5′ UTR of HA gene for the virus rescue in MDCK cells stably expressing HA. The virus was also constructed with the disrupted M2 ORF in segment seven to ensure that M2 from the RBD-M2 was utilized. The chimeric gene was intact and strongly expressed in infected cells upon several passages, suggesting that the antigen was stably maintained in the vaccine candidate. Mice inoculated with scPR8-RBD-M2 via two alternative prime-boost regimens (intranasal-intranasal or intranasal-intramuscular routes) elicited robust mucosal and systemic humoral immune responses and cell-mediated immunity. Notably, we demonstrated that immunized mouse sera exhibited neutralizing activity against pseudotyped viruses bearing SARS-CoV-2 spikes from various variants, albeit with varying potency.

Conceiving ethical responses to these challenges is a public health imperative but must take context into account. This is particularly important in sub‐Saharan Africa (SSA). In this paper, we examine how some of the ethical recommendations offered so far in high‐income countries might appear from a SSA perspective. We also reflect on some of the key ethical challenges raised by the COVID‐19 pandemic in low‐income countries suffering from chronic shortages in health care resources, and chronic high morbidity and mortality from non‐COVID‐19 causes. A parallel is drawn between the distribution of severity of COVID‐19 disease and the classic “Fortune at the bottom of the pyramid” model that is relevant in SSA. Focusing allocation of resources during COVID‐19 on the ‘thick’ part of the pyramid in Low‐to‐Middle Income Countries (LMICs) could be ethically justified on utilitarian and social justice grounds, since it prioritizes a large number of persons who have been economically and socially marginalized. During the pandemic, importing allocation frameworks focused on the apex of the pyramid from the global north may therefore not always be appropriate. In a post‐COVID‐19 world, we need to think strategically about how health care systems can be financed and structured to ensure broad access to adequate health care for all who need it. The root problems underlying health inequity, exposed by COVID‐19, must be addressed, not just to prepare for the next pandemic, but to care for people in resource poor settings in non‐pandemic times.","Moodley, Keymanthri; Rennie, Stuart; Behets, Frieda; Obasa, Adetayo Emmanuel; Yemesi, Robert; Ravez, Laurent; Kayembe, Patrick; Makindu, Darius; Mwinga, Alwyn; Jaoko, Walter",Dev World Bioeth,505,22

As a result, post-lockdown COVID-19 dynamics are heterogeneous and difficult to interpret. We describe a set of contact surveys performed in four Chinese cities (Wuhan, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Changsha) during the pre-pandemic, lockdown and post-lockdown periods to quantify changes in contact patterns. In the post-lockdown period, the mean number of contacts increased by 5 to 17% as compared to the lockdown period. However, it remains three to seven times lower than its pre-pandemic level sufficient to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Landscape epidemiology uses statistical associations between environmental variables and diseases to study and predict their spatial distributions. Phylogeography augments epidemiological knowledge by studying the evolution of viral genetics through space and time. Cluster detection and early warning systems assist surveillance and can permit timely interventions. Advanced statistical models can accommodate spatial dependence present in epidemiological datasets and can permit assessment of uncertainties in disease data and predictions. Mathematical models are particularly useful for testing and comparing alternative control strategies, whereas spatial decision-support systems integrate a variety of spatial epidemiological tools to facilitate widespread dissemination and interpretation of disease data.

Debts have been relatively understudied as a specific aspect of socioeconomic disadvantage contributing to poor mental health. This study examines the bidirectional association between debts and common mental disorders (CMDs) in the adult population of the Netherlands. Data were obtained from the second (‘baseline’) and third (3-year follow-up) wave of the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2, a representative cohort of adults. Questions were asked about debts and difficulty in repaying debts in the past 12 months. The answers were combined into one variable: no debts, easy, difficult, and very difficult to pay back debts. Twelve-month CMDs were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview version 3.0. Increasing levels of difficulty in repaying debts predicted onset of CMD at follow-up in those without 12-month CMD at baseline, and persistence of CMD at follow-up in those with 12-month CMD at baseline. Conversely, CMD was not linked to onset of debts at follow-up in those without 12-month debts at baseline, but was associated with persistence of difficulty to pay back debts at follow-up in those with 12-month debts at baseline. These associations remained significant after adjustment for baseline sociodemographic variables, negative life events and physical health. Health professionals and debt counsellors should pay more attention to patients’ debts and clients’ mental health respectively in order to refer those with financial or mental health problems to the appropriate services.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: No therapies exist for ARDS and treatment is purely supportive. Interleukin-22 (IL-22) plays an integral component in recovery of the lung from infection. IL-22:Fc is a recombinant protein with a human FC immunoglobulin that increases the half-life of IL-22. STUDY DESIGN: ARDS was induced in C57BL/6 mice with intra-tracheal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at a dose of 33.3 or 100 ug. In the low-dose LPS group (LDG), IL-22:FC was administered via tail vein injection at 30 minutes (n = 9) and compared to sham (n = 9). In the high-dose LPS group (HDG), IL-22:FC was administered (n = 11) then compared to sham (n = 8). Euthanasia occurred after bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) on post-injury day 4. RESULTS: In the LDG, IL-22:FC resulted in decreased protein leak (0.15 vs. 0.25 ug/uL, p = 0.02). BAL protein in animals receiving IL-22:Fc in the HDG was not different. For the HDG, animals receiving IL-22:Fc had lower BAL cell counts (539,636 vs 3,147,556 cells/uL, p = 0.02). For the HDG, IL-6 (110.6 vs. 527.1 pg/mL, p = 0.04), TNF-α (5.87 vs. 25.41 pg/mL, p = 0.04), and G-CSF (95.14 vs. 659.6, p = 0.01) levels were lower in the BAL fluid of IL-22:Fc treated animals compared to sham. CONCLUSIONS: IL-22:Fc decreases lung inflammation and lung capillary leak in ARDS. IL-22:Fc may be a novel therapy for ARDS.","Taghavi, Sharven; Jackson-Weaver, Olan; Abdullah, Sarah; Wanek, Alanna; Drury, Robert; Packer, Jacob; Cotton-Betteridge, Aaron; Duchesne, Juan; Pociask, Derek; Kolls, Jay",PLoS One,505,16

DESIGN: Serial cross-sectional design with four consecutive surveys. SETTING: Nationwide general population in South Korea. PARTICIPANTS: Overall 4010 respondents (aged 19 years and over) from the general population during the MERS-CoV epidemic were included. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were (1) affective risk perception, (2) cognitive risk perception, and (3) trust in the government. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify factors (demographic, socioeconomic, area and political orientation) associated with risk perceptions. RESULTS: Both affective and cognitive risk perceptions decreased as the MERS-CoV epidemic progressed. Proportions of affective risk perception were higher in all surveys and slowly decreased compared with cognitive risk perception over time. Females (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.72–2.00; 95% CI 1.14 to 2.86) and lower self-reported household economic status respondents were more likely to perceive the affective risk. The older the adults, the higher the affective risk perception, but the lower the cognitive risk perception compared with younger adults. The respondents who had low trust in the government had higher affective (aOR 2.19–3.11; 95 CI 1.44 to 4.67) and cognitive (aOR 3.55–5.41; 95 CI 1.44 to 9.01) risk perceptions. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that even if cognitive risk perception is dissolved, affective risk perception can continue during MERS-CoV epidemic. Risk perception associating factors (ie, gender, age and self-reported household economic status) appear to be noticeably different between affective and cognitive dimensions. It also indicates that trust in the government influences affective risk perception and cognitive risk perception. There is a need for further efforts to understand the mechanism regarding the general public’s risk perception for eﬀective risk communication.","Jang, Won Mo; Kim, Un-Na; Jang, Deok Hyun; Jung, Hyemin; Cho, Sanghyun; Eun, Sang Jun; Lee, Jin Yong",BMJ Open,505,5

The intent of this study is to report PED utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic in an urban pediatric referral center located close to the epicenter in the northeastern US. A retrospective analysis of medical records of patients visiting the PED at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) was performed. Data included: daily census, admission rate, Emergency Severity Index, and ICD-10 diagnosis codes for the period of February through July, 2018 to 2020. By the week of March 26th, visits had decreased by 70% compared to the average of the previous 2 years. This census nadir lasted for 6 weeks. At 5 weeks postnadir the average daily census recovered to levels 40% lower than prior year norms and remained at that level during subsequent months. The greatest decreases were seen in low-acuity visits. Visits for behavioral health and fractures decreased by approximately 50% and 70%, respectively, but recovered to prior year norms by June and July of 2020. Visits for asthma exacerbation decreased by as much as 87% and remained at record lows for the remainder of the study period. A substantial and persistent decrease in PED visitation was experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas visits for behavioral health and fractures have recovered to prior year norms, visits for asthma exacerbation remain at record lows. Further research is needed to ascertain the causes of these changes, including patient perceptions of the PED.","Pepper, Matthew Philip; Leva, Ernest; Trivedy, Prerna; Luckey, James; Baker, Mark Douglas",Medicine (Baltimore),505,30

This study aims to explore the effect of environmental pollution, particulate matter (PM 2.5 μm), carbon monoxide (CO) and Ozone (O(3)) on daily cases and daily deaths due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in a largest metropolitan city London, United Kingdom. METHODS: For this study, we selected London, one of the highly populated capitals, and markedly affected due to COVID-19 pandemic. The data on the SARS-CoV-2 daily new cases and deaths were recorded from UK-gov Web ""Coronavirus COVId-19 in the UK, 2020"". The daily environmental pollutants PM 2.5 μm, CO and O(3) were recorded from the metrological web ""(London Air Pollution, Air Quality Index- AQI, 2020)"". The daily cases, deaths, PM 2.5 μm, CO and O(3) were documented from the date of the occurrence of the first case of SARS-CoV-2 in London, February 24 to November 2, 2020. RESULTS: The SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths were positively related with environmental pollutants, PM2.5, O(3) and CO levels. Additionally, with 1 µm increase in PM2.5 the number of cases and deaths significantly increased by 1.1% and 2.3% respectively. A 1 unit increase in CO level significantly increased the number of cases and deaths by 21.3% and 21.8% respectively. A similar trend was observed in O(3), with 1-unit increase, the number of cases and deaths were significantly increased respectively by 0.8% and 4.4%.

The present study elucidated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the blood–testis barrier (BTB) in patients who died from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) complications. METHODS: In this study, lung and testis tissue was collected from autopsies of COVID-19 positive (n = 10) and negative men (n = 10) and was taken for stereology, immunocytochemistry, and RNA extraction. RESULTS: Evaluation of the lung tissue showed that the SARS-CoV-2 infection caused extensive damage to the lung tissue and also increases inflammation in testicular tissue and destruction of the testicular blood barrier. Autopsied testicular specimens of COVID-19 showed that COVID-19 infection significantly changes the spatial arrangement of testicular cells and notably decreased the number of Sertoli cells. Moreover, the immunohistochemistry results showed a significant reduction in the protein expression of occluding, claudin-11, and connexin-43 in the COVID-19 group. In addition, we also observed a remarkable enhancement in protein expression of CD68 in the testes of the COVID-19 group in comparison with the control group. Furthermore, the result showed that the expression of TNF-α, IL1β, and IL6 was significantly increased in COVID-19 cases as well as the expression of occludin, claudin-11, and connexin-43 was decreased in COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the present study demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 could induce the up-regulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine and down-regulation of junctional proteins of the BTB, which can disrupt BTB and ultimately impair spermatogenesis.","Peirouvi, Tahmineh; Aliaghaei, Abbas; Eslami Farsani, Bahram; Ziaeipour, Sanaz; Ebrahimi, Vahid; Forozesh, Mehdi; Ghadipasha, Masoud; Mahmoudiasl, Gholam-Reza; Aryan, Arefeh; Moghimi, Negin; Abdi, Shabnam; Raoofi, Amir; Kargar Godaneh, Mohammadhossein; Abdollahifar, Mohammad-Amin",Inflamm Res,505,27

MAIN BODY: In light of the higher vulnerability of men to COVID-19 than women, there is rising concerns on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on male fertility and possibilities of seminal contamination and transmission. The pandemic has attributed to the brief suspension of many fertility clinics and pathology laboratories, though many remained functional. Few reports reflect that SARS-CoV-2 can contaminate the semen of COVID-19 patients as well as that of recovering patients. The viral invasion into the testis may be due to the disrupted anatomical barriers of the testis by the inflammatory responses, and the persistence of the virus in the semen may be facilitated by the testicular immune privilege. Since SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped RNA virus, it is also theoretically possible that this virus can remain viable in the semen samples even after cryopreservation with liquid nitrogen. CONCLUSION: The present review emphasizes the possibilities of seminal dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 and thereby the chances of its sexual transmission. These perceptions and predictions are to facilitate immediate necessary actions to improvise the standard precautionary procedures for laboratory practices, including semen analysis or processing the semen sample for fertility treatments.","Bhattacharya, Koushik; Mukhopadhyay, Lipika Das; Goswami, Ratnadeep; Dutta, Sulagna; Sengupta, Pallav; Irez, Tulay; Hamid, Habibah Abdul; Syamal, Alak Kumar",Middle East Fertil Soc J,505,18

Several studies have demonstrated that APRV can improve oxygenation and lung recruitment in patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Although most patients with COVID-19 meet the Berlin criteria for ARDS, hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 may differ from traditional ARDS as patients often present with severe, refractory hypoxemia and significant variation in respiratory system compliance. To date, no studies investigating APRV in this patient population have been published. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of APRV as a rescue mode of ventilation in critically ill patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and refractory hypoxemia. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients admitted with COVID-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation who were treated with a trial of APRV for refractory hypoxemia. PaO(2)/FIO(2) (P/F ratio), ventilatory ratio and ventilation outputs before and during APRV were compared. RESULTS: APRV significantly improved the P/F ratio and decreased FIO(2) requirements. PaCO(2) and ventilatory ratio were also improved. There was an increase in tidal volume per predicted body weight during APRV and a decrease in total minute ventilation. On multivariate analysis, higher inspiratory to expiratory ratio (I: E) and airway pressure were associated with greater improvement in P/F ratio. CONCLUSIONS: APRV may improve oxygenation, alveolar ventilation and CO(2) clearance in patients with COVID-19 and refractory hypoxemia. These effects are more pronounced with higher airway pressure and inspiratory time.","Mahmoud, Omar; Patadia, Deep; Salonia, James",J Intensive Care Med,505,18

Aberrant regulation of these kinases is a major cause of human disease. We report here that the vertebrate nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src-related kinase lacking C-terminal regulatory tyrosine and N-terminal myristylation sites (SRMS) inhibits autophagy and promotes growth in a nutrient-responsive manner. Under nutrient-replete conditions, SRMS phosphorylates the PHLPP scaffold FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51), disrupts the FKBP51-PHLPP complex, and promotes FKBP51 degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This prevents PHLPP-mediated dephosphorylation of AKT, causing sustained AKT activation that promotes growth and inhibits autophagy. SRMS is amplified and overexpressed in human cancers where it drives unrestrained AKT signaling in a kinase-dependent manner. SRMS kinase inhibition activates autophagy, inhibits cancer growth, and can be accomplished using the FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib. This illuminates SRMS as a targetable vulnerability in human cancers and as a new target for pharmacological induction of autophagy in vertebrates.","Park, Jung Mi; Yang, Seung Wook; Zhuang, Wei; Bera, Asim K.; Liu, Yan; Gurbani, Deepak; von Hoyningen-Huene, Sergei J.; Sakurada, Sadie Miki; Gan, Haiyun; Pruett-Miller, Shondra M.; Westover, Kenneth D.; Potts, Malia B.",PLoS Biol,505,17

The objective was to assess the depressive and anxiety symptoms during lockdown in hemodialysis patients and their caregivers, to assess their coping strategies during this period and to assess the symptoms of depression, anxiety and post traumatic stress beyond confinement. METHOD: We sent, during lockdown period, between April and May 2020, self-questionnaires to voluntary subjects (patients and caregivers), treated by hemodialysis or who worked in hemodialysis in one of the 14 participating centers in France. We analyzed their perception of dialysis sessions (beneficial or worrying), their stress level (VAS rated from 0 to 10), their anxiety and depressive symptoms (HADS). Factors associated with stress, anxiety and depression were analyzed with multiple logistic regression models. We will look for associations between coping strategies, participant characteristics and symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression using chi-square tests. A second questionnaire was sent out in October to collect symptoms of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress beyond confinement. Symptoms will be described and factors associated with stress, anxiety and depression will be analyzed with multiple logistic regression models. RESULTS: 669 patients and 325 caregivers agreed to participate. 70% of participants found it beneficial to come to dialysis during confinement.

Age, gender, history of psychological disorders and perception of dialysis sessions were associated with levels of stress, anxiety and depression. 685 subjects participated in the second part of the study (68.9% of the participants of the first part). Analyzes of this data are in progress. CONCLUSION: During the lockdown period, in France, the majority of hemodialysis patients and caregivers found it beneficial to come to dialysis. One in 3 subjects had anxiety symptoms and one in 5 subjects had depressive symptoms. It will be interesting to investigate if there was an association between the coping strategies implemented by the participants and their level of stress, anxiety and depression during confinement and to analyze the evolution of the anxiety-depressive symptoms over time.","Prezelin-Reydit, Mathilde; Guerraoui, Abdallah; Dolley-Hitze, Thibault; Vendrely, Benoît; Chantrel, François; Kolko-Labadens, Anne; Azzouz, Lynda; Bouillier, Marc; Pelletier, Solenne; Fessi, Hafedh; Vigneau, Cécile; Combe, Christian; Caillette-Beaudoin, Agnes; Chauveau, Philippe; Lasseur, Catherine; Idier, Laetitia",Nephrol Dial Transplant,505,1

Herbs have been utilized for hundreds of years in traditional Chinese, African and Indian medicine and even in some Western countries, for the treatment of oral and dental conditions including but not limited to dental caries, gingivitis and toothaches, dental pulpitis, halitosis (bad breath), mucositis, sore throat, oral wound infections, and periodontal abscesses. Herbs have also been used as plaque removers (chew sticks), antimicrobials, analgesics, anti-inflammatory agents, and antiseptics. Cannabis sativa L. in particular has been utilized in traditional Asian medicine for tooth-pain management, prevention of dental caries and reduction in gum inflammation. The distribution of cannabinoid (CB) receptors in the mouth suggest that the endocannabinoid system may be a target for the treatment of oral and dental diseases. Most recently, interest has been geared toward the use of Cannabidiol (CBD), one of several secondary metabolites produced by C. sativa L. CBD is a known anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anxiolytic, anti-microbial and anti-cancer agent, and as a result, may have therapeutic potential against conditions such burning mouth syndrome, dental anxiety, gingivitis, and possible oral cancer. Other major secondary metabolites of C. sativa L. such as terpenes and flavonoids also share anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anxiolytic and anti-microbial properties and may also have dental and oral applications.

Because closures are costly and damaging, many jurisdictions have since reopened schools with control measures in place. Early evidence indicated that schools were low risk and children were unlikely to be very infectious, but it is becoming clear that children and youth can acquire and transmit COVID-19 in school settings and that transmission clusters and outbreaks can be large. We describe the contrasting literature on school transmission, and argue that the apparent discrepancy can be reconciled by heterogeneity, or “overdispersion” in transmission, with many exposures yielding little to no risk of onward transmission, but some unfortunate exposures causing sizeable onward transmission. In addition, respiratory viral loads are as high in children and youth as in adults, pre- and asymptomatic transmission occur, and the possibility of aerosol transmission has been established. We use a stochastic individual-based model to find the implications of these combined observations for cluster sizes and control measures. We consider both individual and environment/activity contributions to the transmission rate, as both are known to contribute to variability in transmission. We find that even small heterogeneities in these contributions result in highly variable transmission cluster sizes in the classroom setting, with clusters ranging from 1 to 20 individuals in a class of 25. None of the mitigation protocols we modeled, initiated by a positive test in a symptomatic individual, are able to prevent large transmission clusters unless the transmission rate is low (in which case large clusters do not occur in any case). Among the measures we modeled, only rapid universal monitoring (for example by regular, onsite, pooled testing) accomplished this prevention. We suggest approaches and the rationale for mitigating these larger clusters, even if they are expected to be rare.","Tupper, Paul; Colijn, Caroline",PLoS Comput Biol,505,15

We show that IFITM expression reduces HIV-1 viral protein synthesis by preferentially excluding viral mRNA transcripts from translation and thereby restricts viral production. Codon-optimization of proviral DNA rescues viral translation, implying that IFITM-mediated restriction requires recognition of viral RNA elements. In addition, we find that expression of the viral accessory protein Nef can help overcome the IFITM-mediated inhibition of virus production. Our studies identify a novel role for IFITMs in inhibiting HIV replication at the level of translation, but show that the effects can be overcome by the lentiviral protein Nef.","Lee, Wing-Yiu Jason; Liang, Chen; Sloan, Richard D",bioRxiv,505,22

As environmental exposures do not respect state borders, a globalist concept of global health response has developed, which requires transparency and cooperation for coordinated responses to disease outbreaks. Countries that avoid cooperation on health issues for social or political reasons can endanger the global community. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the rapid change in China's infectious disease policy between 2000 and 2013, from actively rejecting the assistance of international health experts during the HIV/AIDS and severe acute respiratory syndrome crises to following best-practice disease response policies and cooperating with international health actors during the 2013 avian influenza outbreak. METHODS: Using international relations theory, I examined whether international political factors had a major influence on this change. Using the case studies of international reputation, socialization with international organizations, and the securitization of infectious disease, this study examined the influence of international and domestic pressures on Chinese infectious disease policy. FINDINGS: Although international relations theory, especially theories popular in global health diplomacy literature, provide valuable insight into the role of international factors and foreign policy interests in China's changing approach to infectious disease control, it cannot provide viable explanations without considering the domestic interests of the Chinese government. CONCLUSION: Analysis of state responses to infectious disease using international relations theories must consider domestic political factors.","Goldizen, Fiona C.",Ann Glob Health,505,26

Its most severe manifestations are pneumonia, systemic and pulmonary thromboembolism, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and respiratory failure. A swab test is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19 despite the high number of false negatives. Radiologists play a crucial role in the rapid identification and early diagnosis of pulmonary involvement. Lung ultrasound (LUS) and computed tomography (CT) have a high sensitivity in detecting pulmonary interstitial involvement. LUS is a low-cost and radiation-free method, which allows a bedside approach and needs disinfection of only a small contact area, so it could be particularly useful during triage and in intensive care units (ICUs). High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is particularly useful in evaluating disease progression or resolution, being able to identify even the smallest changes.","Campagnano, Sarah; Angelini, Flavia; Fonsi, Giovanni Battista; Novelli, Simone; Drudi, Francesco Maria",J Ultrasound,505,22

To avoid the spreading of the virus, mathematical models predicting the course of infection spread1 become the basis to plan stringent countermeasures. We applied a published algorithm to real data up to September 27th, modeling two scenarios where predicted and real data were compared: a conservative scenario with a lockdown still ongoing and a scenario reflecting what actually happened in Italy, where the lockdown has been removed. Results revealed that the number of individuals in life-threatening condition is much lower than predicted, as well as the number of symptomatic individuals. Contrarily, the number of asymptomatic individuals is much higher than predicted.

The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety of patients who have undergone pulmonary resection for lung cancer as well as provider safety, using COVID-19 testing, symptoms and early patient outcomes. METHODS: Patients with confirmed or suspected pulmonary malignancy who underwent resection from 13 March to 4 May 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Between 13 March and 4 May 2020, 2087 COVID-19 patients were admitted, with a median daily census of 299, to one of our Manhattan campuses (80% of hospital capacity). During this time, 21 patients (median age 72 years) out of 45 eligible surgical candidates underwent pulmonary resection—13 lobectomies, 6 segmentectomies and 2 pneumonectomies were performed by the same providers who were caring for COVID-19 patients. None of the patients developed major complications, 5 had minor complications, and the median length of hospital stay was 2 days. No previously COVID-19-negative patient (n = 20/21) or healthcare provider (n = 9: 3 surgeons, 3 surgical assistants, 3 anaesthesiologists) developed symptoms of or tested positive for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary resection for lung cancer is safe in selected patients, even when performed by providers who care for COVID-19 patients in a hospital with a large COVID-19 census.

At prevalence rates ranging from 0–14.3%, the number of tests required to identify the infection status of all patients was reduced by 75.6% as compared to conventional testing in primary human SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swabs and a coronavirus model system. Additionally, our modified pooling and RNA extraction process minimized sample dilution which remained constant as pool sizes increased.

The aim of the study is to analyse psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. For this, a cross-sectional observational study with a sample of 4180 people over the age of 18 during quarantine was developed. Variables considered were sociodemographic variables, physical symptoms, health conditions, COVID-19 contact history and psychological adjustment. The data were collected through a self-developed questionnaire and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Bivariate analyses were performed, including Chi-Squared test and Student’s T-test. Predictive ability was calculated through logistic regression. Results obtained showed a high level of psychological distress (72.0%), with a higher percentage in women and people of lower middle age. Statistically significant differences were found in the variable working situation (χ² = 63.139, p ≤ 0.001, V = 0.123) and living with children under the age of 16 (χ² = 7.393, p = 0.007, V = 0.042).

This review endeavors to color the context into which methodology has to fit and underlines the importance of sampling and sample treatment. The context is that the highest risk of food contamination is through the animal and human fecal route with a majority of foodborne infections originating from sources in mass and domestic kitchens at the end of the food-chain. Containment requires easy-to-use, failsafe, single-use tests giving an overall risk score in situ. Conversely, progressive food-safety systems are relying increasingly on early assessment of batches and groups involving risk-based sampling, monitoring environment and herd/flock health status, and (historic) food-chain information. Accordingly, responsible field laboratories prefer specificity, multi-analyte, and high-throughput procedures. Under certain etiological and epidemiological circumstances, indirect antigen immunoaffinity assays outperform the diagnostic sensitivity and diagnostic specificity of e.g., nucleic acid sequence-based assays. The current bulk of testing involves therefore ante- and post-mortem probing of humoral response to several pathogens. In this review, the inclusion of immunoglobulins against additional invasive micro-organisms indicating the level of hygiene and ergo public health risks in tests is advocated. Immunomagnetic separation, immunochromatography, immunosensor, microsphere array, lab-on-a-chip/disc platforms increasingly in combination with nanotechnologies, are discussed. The heuristic development of portable and ambulant microfluidic devices is intriguing and promising. Tant pis, many new platforms seem unattainable as the industry standard. Comparability of results with those of reference methods hinders the implementation of new technologies.

Furthermore, RNAi represents a promising novel therapeutic option for treating human diseases, in particular cancer. Selective gene silencing by RNAi can be achieved essentially by two nucleic acid based methods: i) cytoplasmic delivery of short double-stranded (ds) interfering RNA oligonucleotides (siRNA), where the gene silencing effect is only transient in nature, and possibly not suitable for all applications; or ii) nuclear delivery of gene expression cassettes that express short hairpin RNA (shRNA), which are processed like endogenous interfering RNA and lead to stable gene down-regulation. Both processes involve the use of nucleic acid based drugs, which are highly charged and do not cross cell membranes by free diffusion. Therefore, in vivo delivery of RNAi therapeutics must use technology that enables the RNAi therapeutic to traverse biological membrane barriers in vivo. Viruses and the vectors derived from them carry out precisely this task and have become a major delivery system for shRNA. Here, we summarize and compare different currently used viral delivery systems, give examples of in vivo applications, and indicate trends for new developments, such as replicating viruses for shRNA delivery to cancer cells.","Sliva, Katja; Schnierle, Barbara S",Virol J,505,30

Reaching a swift, reliable diagnosis of COVID-19 in the emergency departments is imperative to direct patients to proper care and to prevent disease dissemination. COVID-19 diagnosis is based on the identification of viral RNA through RT-PCR from oral-nasopharyngeal swabs, which however presents suboptimal sensitivity and may require several hours in overstressed laboratories. These drawbacks have called for an additional, complementary first line approach. CT is the gold standard method for the detection of interstitial pneumonia, a hallmark feature of COVID-19, often present in the asymptomatic stage of the disease. Here, we show that CT scan presents a sensitivity of 95.48% (std.err=0.35%), vastly outperforming RT-PCR. Additionally, as diagnostic accuracy is influenced by disease prevalence, we argue that predictive values provide a more precise measure of CT reliability in the current pandemics. We generated a model showing that CT scan is endowed with a high negative predictive value (> 90%) and positive predictive value (69 - 84%), for the range of prevalence seen in countries with rampant dissemination. We conclude that CT is an expedite and reliable diagnostic tool to support first line triage of suspect COVID-19 patients in areas where the diffusion of the virus is widespread.","Esposito, A.; Palmisano, A.; Scotti, G.

Findings 7,406 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from 6,600 patients were identified, of which 1,167 (18.2%) were residents from 337 care homes. 30/71 (42.3%) care home residents tested at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (CUH) died. Genomes were available for 700/1,167 (60%) residents from 292 care homes, and 409 distinct viral clusters were defined. We identified several probable transmissions between care home residents and healthcare workers (HCW). Interpretation Care home residents had a significant burden of COVID-19 infections and high mortality. Larger viral clusters were consistent with within-care home transmission, while multiple clusters per care home suggested independent acquisitions.","Hamilton, W.

Morbidity and mortality after trauma mainly depend on the presence of HS and/or TBI. Rapid “repayment of the O(2) debt” and prevention of brain tissue hypoxia are cornerstones of the management of both HS and TBI. Restoring tissue perfusion, however, generates an ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury due to the formation of reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) species. Moreover, pre-existing-medical-conditions (PEMC’s) can aggravate the occurrence and severity of complications after trauma. In addition to the “classic” chronic diseases (of cardiovascular or metabolic origin), there is growing awareness of psychological PEMC’s, e.g., early life stress (ELS) increases the predisposition to develop post-traumatic-stress-disorder (PTSD) and trauma patients with TBI show a significantly higher incidence of PTSD than patients without TBI. In fact, ELS is known to contribute to the developmental origins of cardiovascular disease. The neurotransmitter H(2)S is not only essential for the neuroendocrine stress response, but is also a promising therapeutic target in the prevention of chronic diseases induced by ELS. The neuroendocrine hormone OT has fundamental importance for brain development and social behavior, and, thus, is implicated in resilience or vulnerability to traumatic events. OT and H(2)S have been shown to interact in physical and psychological trauma and could, thus, be therapeutic targets to mitigate the acute post-traumatic effects of chronic PEMC’s. OT and H(2)S both share anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and vasoactive properties; through the reperfusion injury salvage kinase (RISK) pathway, where their signaling mechanisms converge, they act via the regulation of nitric oxide (NO).","Merz, Tamara; McCook, Oscar; Denoix, Nicole; Radermacher, Peter; Waller, Christiane; Kapapa, Thomas",Int J Mol Sci,505,23
