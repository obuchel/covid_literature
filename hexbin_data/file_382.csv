It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the newborn, particularly in premature infants. Consistent risk factors are birth weight and prematurity. Polycythemia and hyperviscosity altering blood flow and infectious agents are also implicated. Clinical findings include abdominal distention and diarrhea, and systemic symptoms such as apnea, acidosis, and lethargy. Pneumatosis intestinalis can be demonstrated radiographically. Mucosal ulcerations, hemorrhage, and thrombosis occur early, followed by inflammatory changes. Later still necrosis develops. Ischemia, infection, and enteral feedings are suspected to be involved in the pathophysiology. Eicosanoids, especially thromboxane, platelet-activating factor, and leukotrienes are likely mediators.","Cheromcha, David P.; Hyman, Paul E.",Dig Dis Sci,382,19

METHODS: The clinical data for 92 patients with type III esophageal atresia in our hospital from January 2015 to December 2018 were analyzed retrospectively. There were 49 patients in group A who underwent thoracoscopic surgery and 43 patients in group B who underwent conventional surgery. RESULTS: The mechanical ventilation time (55.7 ± 11.4 h vs 75.6 ± 19.2 h), intensive care time (3.6 ± 1.8d vs 4.7 ± 2.0d), postoperative hospitalization time (13.1 ± 2.2d vs 16.8 ± 4.3d), thoracic drainage volume (62.7 ± 25.5 ml vs 125.4 ± 46.1 ml), blood transfusion volume (30.5 ± 10.4 ml vs 55.3 ± 22.7 ml) and surgical incision length (2.0 ± 0.5 cm vs 8.0 ± 1.8 cm) in group A were lower than those in group B, and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Among the postoperative complications, the incidences of postoperative severe pneumonia (8.2% vs 23.3%), poor wound healing (2.0% vs 14.0%) and chest wall deformity (0% vs 11.6%) in group A were significantly lower than those in group B (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of anastomotic stricture, tracheomalacia or gastroesophageal reflux between the two groups after surgery and early during follow-up (P > 0.05), and there were no complications such as achalasia signs and esophageal diverticulum in either group. CONCLUSION: Surgery for type III esophageal atresia via thoracoscopy has the same safety and clinical effectiveness as traditional surgery and has the advantages of smaller incision and chest wall deformity.","Zhang, Jianqin; Wu, Qiang; Chen, Liu; Wang, Yunjin; Cui, Xu; Huang, Wenhua; Zhou, Chaoming",J Cardiothorac Surg,382,17

The complexity of cellular regulation (regulatory, metabolic, and signaling interactions, and their coordinated action) can be tackled via the development of quantitative mathematical models. These models are useful to test biological hypotheses and observations, and to predict the possible behaviors of a synthetic network. Indeed, synthetic biology uses such models to design synthetic networks, prior to their construction in the cell, to perform specific tasks, or to change a biological process in a desired way. The synthetic network is built by assembling biological “parts” taken from different systems; therefore it is fundamental to identify, isolate, and test regulatory motifs which occur frequently in biological pathways. In this chapter, we describe how to model and predict the behavior of synthetic networks in two difference cases: (1) a synthetic network composed of five genes regulating each other through a variety of regulatory interactions in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2) a synthetic transcriptional positive feedback loop stably integrated in Human Embryonic Kidney 293 cells (HEK293).","di Bernardo, Diego; Marucci, Lucia; Menolascina, Filippo; Siciliano, Velia",Synthetic Gene Networks,382,11

Yet the cumulative influence of individual antenatal risk factors on emergent learning skills has not been sufficiently examined. We sought to determine whether antenatal complications, in aggregate, are a source of variability in preschoolers’ kindergarten readiness, and whether specific classes of antenatal risk play a prominent role. We recruited 160 preschoolers (85 girls; ages 3–4 years), born ≤33(6)/(7) weeks’ gestation, and reviewed their hospitalization records. Kindergarten readiness skills were assessed with standardized intellectual, oral-language, prewriting, and prenumeracy tasks. Cumulative antenatal risk was operationalized as the sum of complications identified out of nine common risks. These were also grouped into four classes in follow-up analyses: complications associated with intra-amniotic infection, placental insufficiency, endocrine dysfunction, and uteroplacental bleeding. Linear mixed model analyses, adjusting for sociodemographic and medical background characteristics (socioeconomic status, sex, gestational age, and sum of perinatal complications) revealed an inverse relationship between the sum of antenatal complications and performance in three domains: intelligence, language, and prenumeracy (p = 0.003, 0.002, 0.005, respectively). Each of the four classes of antenatal risk accounted for little variance, yet together they explained 10.5%, 9.8%, and 8.4% of the variance in the cognitive, literacy, and numeracy readiness domains, respectively. We conclude that an increase in the co-occurrence of antenatal complications is moderately linked to poorer kindergarten readiness skills even after statistical adjustment for perinatal risk.

Herein, electrospinning was applied to fabricate composite nanofibrous scaffolds by Poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) and Polyurethane (PU) with and without poly-phosphate (poly-P). Scaffolds were characterized morphologically by scanning electron microscope (SEM), and their biocompatibility was also investigated by SEM, protein adsorption, cell attachment and survival assays. The applicability of the scaffolds for bladder tissue engineering was also evaluated by culturing mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on the scaffolds and their differentiation into smooth muscle cell (SMC) was studied at the gene and protein levels. The results demonstrated that scaffold biocompatibility was increased significantly by loading poly-P. SMC related gene and protein expression level in MSCs cultured on poly-P-loaded scaffold was also increased significantly compared to those cells cultured on empty scaffold. It can be concluded that poly-P hasn’t also increased scaffold biocompatibility, but also SMC differentiation potential of MSCs was also increased while cultured on the poly-P containing scaffold compared to the empty scaffold. Taken together, our study showed that PLGA–PU–poly-P alone and in combination with MSCs has a promising potential for support urinary bladder smooth muscle tissue engineering.","Rezaei, Hossein; Rezaie, Zahra; Seifati, Seyed Morteza; Ardeshirylajimi, Abdolreza; Basiri, Abbas; Taheri, Mohammad; Omrani, Mir Davood",Cell Tissue Bank,382,1

These differences may be followed by differences in the duration of development. Accordingly, it is believed that insect sex may be used to increase the accuracy of insect age estimates in forensic entomology. Here, the sex-specific differences in the development of Creophilus maxillosus were studied at seven constant temperatures. We have also created separate developmental models for males and females of C. maxillosus and tested them in a validation study to answer a question whether sex-specific developmental models improve the accuracy of insect age estimates. Results demonstrate that males of C. maxillosus developed significantly longer than females. The sex-specific and general models for the total immature development had the same optimal temperature range and similar developmental threshold but different thermal constant K, which was the largest in the case of the male-specific model and the smallest in the case of the female-specific model. Despite these differences, validation study revealed just minimal and statistically insignificant differences in the accuracy of age estimates using sex-specific and general thermal summation models. This finding indicates that in spite of statistically significant differences in the duration of immature development between females and males of C. maxillosus, there is no increase in the accuracy of insect age estimates while using the sex-specific thermal summation models compared to the general model. Accordingly, this study does not support the use of sex-specific developmental data for the estimation of insect age in forensic entomology.

The purpose of this study was to examine elementary classroom teachers’ self-reported use of MI products and subsequent perceptions of the facilitators of and barriers to MI product use. This study utilized a mixed-methods design. Elementary classroom teachers (n = 40) at four schools each tested four of six common MI products in their classroom for one week. Teachers completed a daily diary, documenting duration and frequency of product use. Following each product test, focus groups were conducted with teachers to assess facilitators and barriers. MI product use lasted for 11.2 (Standard Deviation (SD) = 7.5) min/occasion and MI products were used 4.1 (SD = 3.5) times/week on average. Activity Bursts in the Classroom for Fitness, GoNoodle, and Physical Activity Across the Curriculum were most frequently used. Facilitators of and barriers to MI product use were identified within three central areas—logistics, alignment with teaching goals, and student needs and interests. Teachers were receptive to MI products and used them frequently throughout the week. When considering the adoption of MI products, teachers, administrators, and policy makers should consider products that are readily usable, align with teaching goals, and are consistent with student needs and interests.","Dugger, Roddrick; Rafferty, Aaron; Hunt, Ethan; Beets, Michael; Webster, Collin; Chen, Brian; Rehling, Jeff; Weaver, Robert Glenn",Children (Basel),382,25

They are negative-stranded RNA viruses with six known species identified to date. Ebola virus (EBOV) is a member of Zaire ebolavirus species and can cause the Ebola virus disease (EVD), an emerging zoonotic disease that results in homeostatic imbalance and multi-organ failure. There are three EBOV outbreaks documented in the last six years resulting in significant morbidity (>32,000 cases) and mortality (>13,500 deaths). The potential factors contributing to the high infectivity of this virus include multiple entry mechanisms, susceptibility of the host cells, employment of multiple immune evasion mechanisms and rapid person-to-person transmission. EBOV infection leads to cytokine storm, disseminated intravascular coagulation, host T cell apoptosis as well as cell mediated and humoral immune response. In this review, a concise recap of cell types targeted by EBOV and EVD symptoms followed by detailed run-through of host innate and adaptive immune responses, virus-driven regulation and their combined effects contributing to the disease pathogenesis has been presented.

The management of UTIs usually is conservative medical antibiotic treatment. However, recurrent UTIs in the SCI patient population warrant further investigation. The method of urinary drainage (intermittent or indwelling urinary catheters, urinary diversion) and untreated complications of NLUTD (vesicoureteral reflux, stone formation, chronic incomplete emptying of the bladder) are risk factors for recurrent UTIs (rUTIs). Removal of these UTI risk factors and improving urinary drainage are goals of urologic management; however, when conservative interventions do not succeed, surgery may be a viable solution in select cases of rUTIs. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of complicated persisting rUTIs and associated urethral discharge in a middle-aged SCI male who manages his bladder with intermittent catheterization (IC). We detail the evaluation and management approach that leads to an eventual transurethral prostatectomy (TURP) as a final solution for his rUTIs. Fortunately, the surgical intervention was successful, and the patient is free of UTIs after 4 years of follow-up. DISCUSSION: In SCI male patients with rUTIs and suspected chronic prostatitis, TURP may be a valuable treatment option once all predisposing factors have been remediated.","Konstantinidis, Charalampos; Karafotias, Achileas; Eleftheropoulos, Ioannis; Delakas, Dimitrios",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,382,1

The Argus II Retinal Prosthesis is a surgically implanted medical device that delivers electrical stimulation to the retina. It is intended to produce a form of artificial vision for blind people with severe-to-profound retinitis pigmentosa by stimulating the remaining viable retinal cells to induce visual perception. This study has been initiated by National Health Service England’s Commissioning through Evaluation program and funded through the National Institute of Health Research of the United Kingdom. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the Argus II device on patient’s daily activities and quality of life. METHODS: This protocol is a prospective, single-arm, open-label, mixed methods study on 10 consecutive participants receiving the Argus II device. The patient representatives played an integral role in the design of this study. Eligibility criteria include ultra-low vision in both eyes as a result of end-stage retinitis pigmentosa and a willingness and capacity to complete the postimplantation rehabilitation program. Participants will be interviewed by independent researchers at baseline and 12 months later by using a semistructured, in-depth approach, alongside validated questionnaires (Impact of Vision Impairment-Very Low Vision, 5-level EuroQoL-5 dimensions scale, EuroQoL-visual analog scale, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and a bespoke device-related questionnaire, which includes questions about users’ experiences with the procedure, the device, and rehabilitation. The effect of the device on patients’ functional vision and activities of daily living will be assessed by vision rehabilitation specialists using a set of tests measured on an ordinal scale (eg, ability to locate objects and avoid obstacles). Clinical outcomes include full-field stimulus light threshold, square localization, direction of motion, grating visual acuity, Landolt-C, procedural success, and adverse events. Qualitative and quantitative outcomes will be linked in a single database to enable individual participant measures to be considered in toto, comparing baseline to the final review. RESULTS: This study was approved by the local ethics committee on April 24, 2019 (London-Camberwell St. Giles Research Ethics Committee, reference 19/LO/0429). It has also been approved by the Health Research Authority and Health and Care Research Wales. At the time of protocol writing, Argus II was available for use in the United Kingdom; however, the manufacturer recently withdrew the Argus II device from sale in the United Kingdom. Therefore, the study is not going ahead at this time. CONCLUSIONS: The mixed methods approach provides a rich and in-depth assessment of the effect of the device on participants’ quality of life. Despite the work not going ahead, the publication of this publicly funded protocol is important for researchers planning similar work.

Reindeer husbandry is considered an extensive animal husbandry, where the animals are kept mostly on natural pastures, although sometimes kept in fenced areas for shorter periods. These reindeer may harbour a variety of parasites that may affect animal health and production. The relatively limited close contact between herds and owners gives limited opportunities for diagnosis and treatment of diseases in general. Furthermore, the effects of subclinical parasitism in livestock are commonly expressed as a reduction in productivity rather than clinical disease and mortality. Thus, specific knowledge of endoparasites and parasitic infections in these herds is scarce. This study investigated the occurrence of various endoparasites in reindeer by analysis of a total of 114 faecal samples from winter-slaughtered reindeer from two different grazing areas in Troms and Finnmark, Norway. RESULTS: Using a McMaster method, a Baermann technique, and a direct immunofluorescent antibody test, the following parasites were identified in the faecal samples with the occurrence data given as percentages: Strongylid eggs (62%), Nematodirinae spp. eggs (24%), Capillaria sp. eggs (42%) and Moniezia spp. eggs (17%), Dictyocaulus spp. larvae (14%) protostrongylid larvae (40%), Eimera spp. oocysts (23%), and Giardia duodenalis cysts (5%). Cryptosporidium oocysts were not detected. Parasite eggs, oocysts, and cysts were quantified. Molecular analysis revealed G. duodenalis sub-assemblage AI, a potentially zoonotic genotype not previously reported in reindeer from this region. Morphological analyses of Eimeria oocysts identified two species, Eimeria mayeri and Eimeria rangiferis, and molecular analyses of the cytochrome C oxidase I (coi) gene and 18 s rRNA (18SSU) gene of Eimeria confirmed the presence of Eimeria species that are specific to reindeer. CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence, but low burden, of endoparasites was detected in samples from these semi-domesticated reindeer. The samples were collected during winter, when adult gastrointestinal parasites usually produce only low numbers of transmission stages. Therefore, together with the low number of samples, detailed and definitive conclusions regarding parasite status of semi-domesticated reindeer are avoided. Nevertheless, these data provide a snapshot overview of parasite occurrence in a semi-domesticated animal group vulnerable to the various environmental changes to which they are exposed.","Idland, Lene; Juul, Amalie Moen; Solevåg, Ellen Karin; Tysnes, Kristoffer Relling; Robertson, Lucy Jane; Utaaker, Kjersti Selstad",Acta Vet Scand,382,17

The objective of this study was to describe the evolution of these vaccination programs. Methods: This was a targeted literature review of public HPV vaccination programs and vaccination coverage rates, based on information provided by jurisdictional public health authorities. Results: HPV vaccination of schoolgirls began in school years 2007/08 to 2010/11 with three doses of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine in all provinces except Quebec, which started with two doses. By 2018/19, all jurisdictions were vaccinating with two doses of the nonavalent vaccine in both girls and boys, except Quebec, which used a mixed vaccination schedule with one dose of the nonavalent and one dose of the bivalent vaccines. Public HPV vaccination programs in most provinces include after-school catch-up vaccination. Immunocompromised or other high-risk individuals are eligible for the HPV public vaccination program in most provinces, but policies vary by jurisdiction. In 2017/18, vaccination coverage rates in provincial HPV school-based programs varied from 62% in Ontario to 86% in Prince Edward Island in girls and from 58% in Ontario to 86% in Prince Edward Island in boys. Conclusions: Since their introduction, Canadian school-based HPV public vaccination programs have evolved from a three-dose to a two-dose schedule, from a quadrivalent to a nonavalent vaccine, and from a girls-only to a gender-neutral policy. Vaccination coverage rates have varied markedly and only Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland/Labrador have maintained rates exceeding 80%.","Goyette, Alexandra; Yen, Glorian P.; Racovitan, Voica; Bhangu, Parambir; Kothari, Smita; Franco, Eduardo L.",Curr Oncol,382,1

The general assumption is that codon biases reflect a balance between mutational biases and natural selection. Today we understand that the codon content is related and can affect all gene expression steps. Starting from the 1980s, codon-based indices have been used for answering different questions in all biomedical fields, including systems biology, agriculture, medicine, and biotechnology. In general, codon usage bias indices weigh each codon or a small set of codons to estimate the fitting of a certain coding sequence to a certain phenomenon (e.g., bias in codons, adaptation to the tRNA pool, frequencies of certain codons, transcription elongation speed, etc.) and are usually easy to implement. Today there are dozens of such indices; thus, this paper aims to review and compare the different codon usage bias indices, their applications, and advantages. In addition, we perform analysis that demonstrates that most indices tend to correlate even though they aim to capture different aspects. Due to the centrality of codon usage bias on different gene expression steps, it is important to keep developing new indices that can capture additional aspects that are not modeled with the current indices.","Bahiri-Elitzur, Shir; Tuller, Tamir",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,382,1

Therefore, it is important to establish methods for the rapid diagnosis and continuous surveillance of H9N2 subtype AIV. METHODS: In this study, an antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (AC-ELISA) and a colloidal gold immunochromatographic test (ICT) strip using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) 3G4 and 2G7 were established to detect H9N2 subtype AIV. RESULTS: The AC-ELISA method and ICT strip can detect H9N2 subtype AIV quickly, and do not cross-react with other subtype AIVs or other viruses. The detection limit of AC-ELISA was a hemagglutinin (HA) titer of 4 for H9N2 subtype AIV per 100 μl sample, and the limit of detection of the HA protein of AIV H9N2 was 31.5 ng/ml. The ICT strip detection limit was an HA titer of 4 for H9N2 subtype AIV per 100 μl sample. Moreover, both detection methods exhibited good reproducibility and repeatability, with coefficients of variation < 5%. For detection in 200 actual poultry samples, the sensitivities and specificities of AC-ELISA were determined as 93.2% and 98.1%, respectively. The sensitivities and specificities of the ICT strips were determined as 90.9% and 97.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The developed AC-ELISA and ICT strips displayed high specificity, sensitivity, and stability, making them suitable for rapid diagnosis and field investigation of H9N2 subtype AIV.","Xiao, Yixin; Yang, Fan; Liu, Fumin; Yao, Hangping; Wu, Nanping; Wu, Haibo",Virol J,382,1

A key challenge in working with simulated learners is evaluating the accuracy of the simulation compared to the behavior of real human students. One way this evaluation is done is by comparing the error-rate learning curves from a population of human learners and a corresponding set of simulated learners. In this paper, we argue that this approach misses an opportunity to more accurately capture nuances in learning by treating all errors as the same. We present a simulated learner system, the Apprentice Learner (AL) Architecture, and use this more nuanced evaluation to demonstrate ways in which it does and does not explain and accurately predict student learning in terms of the reduction of different kinds of errors over time as it learns, as human students do, from an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS).","Weitekamp, Daniel; Ye, Zihuiwen; Rachatasumrit, Napol; Harpstead, Erik; Koedinger, Kenneth",Artificial Intelligence in Education,382,2

Some individual differences, like self-compassion—the non-judgmental observation of one’s own pain and failure, while understanding that these are part of being human—can protect against burnout. METHODS: We administered the Maslach Burnout Inventory, the Self-Compassion Scale, and the Stressful Life Events Scale to a sample of healthcare professionals (medical residents, nurses, and physicians) in Lebanon (N = 93). RESULTS: The sample demonstrated a high degree of Emotional Exhaustion (M = 27, SD = 11.79), average levels of Depersonalization (M = 9.46, SD = 6.35), and Personal Accomplishment (M = 34.95, SD = 6.58), and moderate levels of Self-compassion (M = 3.25). All burnout components were significantly and inversely associated with self-compassion, with the strongest association found between Emotional Exhaustion and Self-compassion (r = −.37, p < .001). Self-compassion significantly explained burnout, above and beyond sociodemographic and occupational variables (Emotional Exhaustion: ΔR(2) = .11, F (1.85) = 12.71, p < .01; Depersonalization: ΔR(2) = .07, F (1.85) = 6.73, p = .01; Low Personal Accomplishment: ΔR(2) = .11, F (1.85) = 11.29, p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Burnout is prevalent in the sample, yet self-compassion may be a possible protective factor.

These include skin lesions, arthritis, ocular disease, CNS, GI, and vascular involvement. Arterial disease can affect medium and large sized arteries, leading to aneurysm development with the potential to rupture. We report a case of Behcet’s disease presenting in such a manner, with multiple aneurysms at imminent risk of arterial rupture. The presentation occurred at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, in April 2020 with the patient contracting the virus complicating cyclophosphamide immunosuppression therapy post operatively. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: A 54-year-old man had been under rheumatology follow up for numerous years. He reported recurrent oral ulcers, and episodic fevers. He previously had confirmed cerebral sinus thrombosis, aseptic endocarditis, multiple pulmonary emboli and was investigated for inflammatory bowel disease. He presented acutely to AE with a painful, tender left calf and a large pulsatile mass in the calf. He reported paraesthesia in his left leg/foot suggestive of nerve compression. CT angiogram performed, revealed a large 6.5cm x 4cm left tibioperoneal trunk (TPT) pseudoaneurysm (Fig.1), and 1.2cm right anterior tibial (ATA) pseudoaneurysm (Fig 2). There was also a 3.8cm infrarenal inflammatory abdominal aortic pseudoaneurysm (Fig 3), and finally a 2.3cm right lower lobe pulmonary artery aneurysm. Laboratory investigations revealed raised inflammatory markers, with ESR of 120 and CRP 73. A diagnosis of vascular Behcet’s was suspected. Urgent surgical intervention was deemed necessary to prevent limb and life-threatening complications of arterial rupture. He underwent open surgical decompression and graft repair of the left TPT aneurysm. Endovascular stenting of infrarenal AAA was performed and the right ATA aneurysm was ligated and excised. The pulmonary artery aneurysm was managed conservatively, but interval CT Imaging post immunosuppression treatment showed complete resolution. This undoubtedly was due to immunosuppression therapy. The first cyclophosphamide and methylprednisolone infusion were given day 1 post-op. The following day he developed a fever and a dry cough. He subsequently tested positive for SARS-COV-2. This was at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. He required supplementary oxygen, but his condition did not deteriorate further, and he made a complete recovery. A difficult dilemma was posed between immunosuppression and the risk of infection having been diagnosed with COVID-19. An MDT approach was adopted, and input was sought from the Birmingham Bechet’s centre of excellence. He continued immunosuppressive treatment once recovered from the virus. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: Bechet’s disease is considered a form of systemic vasculitis and is unique in its ability to involve blood vessels of all sizes from the arterial and venous systems. Vascular manifestations in Bechet’s disease are associated with increased mortality and morbidity with manifestations more common in men. Arterial rupture is the leading cause of sudden death in patients with Bechet’s disease. Endovascular and perivascular inflammation of large vessels can lead to haemorrhage, aneurysm formation with risk of rupture, stenosis, and thrombus development. To prevent potential life-threatening complications of vascular Bechet’s, a combination of surgical/radiological and medical management is often required. High dose corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide infusions are typically used, with aim to achieve disease remission. It is recommended that if surgical/radiological interventions are indicated, it should ideally be performed when the disease is quiescent. However, urgent intervention is required if the aneurysm is at high risk of rupture, rapidly enlarging or if there is organ threatening ischemia. This was the approach used in this patient. Potent immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide and high dose corticosteroids is indicated in arterial disease of Bechet’s. The inherent risk of infection with these agents, being used at the peak of a global pandemic created a challenging clinical dilemma. To complicate matters further, the patient developed fever and cough following the 1st cyclophosphamide/steroid treatment and tested positive for COVID-19. His condition was relatively mild however and made a full recovery from the virus. Behcet’s disease can be a difficult and challenging condition to diagnose. There is often a delay in diagnosis. Our patient was previously referred to a tertiary Bechet’s centre but felt there was insufficient clinical grounds to make the diagnosis at that stage. CASE REPORT - KEY LEARNING POINTS: This case provides a rare example of an immunosuppressed patient with rheumatic disease contracting COVID-19 after extensive vascular intervention. A poor outcome may have been expected but in contrary the patient’s disease course was mild. This perhaps supports the theory that immunosuppression may play a protective role during COVID-19. The role of immunosuppression in a hyperinflammatory COVID-19 state is an area of much research interest. Suppression of the cytokine storm with immune therapy has been hypothesised as a potential therapy target for some COVID-19 patients. However, this is still unproven. Corticosteroid treatment with dexamethasone has been shown to reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients in hospital, through the Recovery Trial. In addition, encouraging evidence continues to emerge for the role of IL1 and IL6 inhibitors in the cytokine storm. It is rare for a patient to present with such extensive aneurysmal disease. Vascular complications of Bechet’s although rare need to be considered. The management for vascular manifestations of Bechet’s disease requires co-ordination and collaborative work between Rheumatologists, Vascular surgery, and Radiologists. Guidance from expert centres is highly recommended. Prompt medical and surgical intervention is needed to prevent serious limb and life-threatening complications of arterial Bechet’s disease. Our case raises the clinical conundrum of immunosuppression therapy in serious organ threatening rheumatic disease with concomitant COVID-19 infection. A patient-centred approach with patient involvement in clinical decisions is required. Patients and clinicians alike should balance the risks associated with organ threatening rheumatic disease and infection risks. The current global coronavirus pandemic makes such decisions more difficult with an additional communicable disease prevalent in the community. With few clinically proven therapies and no vaccine available for COVID-19, Rheumatologists will have to grapple with this dilemma for the foreseeable future.","Arif, Rameez; Cardy, Caroline",Rheumatol Adv Pract,382,1

We address the challenge by simplifying the structure of the input program while preserving its semantics. For simplification, we leverage common compiler optimizations, which we get for free by using LLVM. Yet, there is a price to pay. Compiler optimizations may introduce bitwise operations, which require bit-precise reasoning. We evaluated an SMT encoding based on the theory of integers + bit conversions against one based on the theory of bit-vectors and found that the latter yields better performance.

Rodents are known to be reservoir hosts of T. gondii and therefore play a significant role in the dissemination of this parasite. We conducted seromonitoring for T. gondii in four sylvatic rodent species in Poland. We report an overall seroprevalence of 5.5% (3.6% for Myodes glareolus and 20% for other vole species). Seroprevalence in bank voles varied significantly between host age and sex. Our results, therefore, make a significant contribution to the understanding of the role of wild rodent populations in the maintenance and dissemination of T. gondii and identify key factors that affect the magnitude of seroprevalence in specific host populations. ABSTRACT: Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular Apicomplexan parasite with a broad range of intermediate hosts, including humans and rodents. Rodents are considered to be reservoirs of infection for their predators, including cats, felids, pigs, and wild boars. We conducted a multi-site, long-term study on T. gondii in northeastern Poland. The study aimed to monitor the seroprevalence of T. gondii in the four abundant vole species found in the region (Myodes glareolus, Microtus arvalis, Microtus agrestis, and Alexandromys oeconomus) and to assess the influence of both extrinsic (year of study and study site) and intrinsic (host sex and host age) factors on seroprevalence. A bespoke enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect antibodies against T. gondii. We examined 577 rodent individuals and detected T. gondii antibodies in the sera of all four rodent species with an overall seroprevalence of 5.5% [4.2–7.3] (3.6% [2.6–4.9] for M. glareolus and 20% [12–30.9] for M. arvalis, M. agrestis, and A. oeconomus). Seroprevalence in bank voles varied significantly between host age and sex. Seroprevalence increased with host age and was higher in females than males. These results contribute to our understanding of the distribution and abundance of T. gondii in voles in Poland and confirm that T. gondii also circulates in M. glareolus and M. arvalis, M. agrestis and A. oeconomus. Therefore, they may potentially play a role as reservoirs of this parasite in the sylvatic environment.","Grzybek, Maciej; Antolová, Daniela; Tołkacz, Katarzyna; Alsarraf, Mohammed; Behnke-Borowczyk, Jolanta; Nowicka, Joanna; Paleolog, Jerzy; Biernat, Beata; Behnke, Jerzy M.; Bajer, Anna",Animals (Basel),382,1

It is known that issues such as frustration and inattention, between others, affect student learning. In this fashion, robotics is an important resource that can be used towards helping to solve these issues, empowering our students in order to push their learning up. In this case, robotic tools are generally used considering two different paradigms: as the main focus and as a secondary focus. Actually, these paradigms define the way that Educational Robotics is implemented in schools. Most of the approaches have implemented it as the main focus, which is teaching Robotics. Nevertheless, there are quite a few works that implement robotics as a secondary focus, which is currently assisting the learning process in several disciplines. The main contribution of this work is a complete three steps methodology for Robotics in Education to guide projects in order to either use it alone or to teach robotics with others topics. Our experiments show the importance of devising a study plan and evaluation method because the process is iterative and could improve the final results. As a novelty, here we have joined and extended our previous works by proposing a new set of methods with guidelines and strategies for applying the educational robotics standard curriculum for kids, named EDUROSC-Kids. We propose several tools that have been developed to organize the learning topics of Robotics for children, including the desired outcomes during the learning process. As said our current approach is divided in three steps (or phases): setting up the environment, defining the project, and performing evaluation. The proposed curriculum organizes robotics contents into five disciplines: Robotics and Society, Mechanics, Electronics, Programming, and Control Theory. Also, it considers a set of topics for each discipline and defines the level of knowledge that is recommended to achieve each group of children based on Bloom’s Nomenclature. The contribution on this paper is a crucial step towards linking the general learning process with Educational Robotics approaches. Our methodology is validated by presenting practical experiences with application of EDUROSC-kids and the proposed method with a rubric guidelines into groups of children.","Patiño-Escarcina, Raquel E.; Barrios-Aranibar, Dennis; Bernedo-Flores, Liz S.; Alsina, Pablo Javier; Gonçalves, Luiz M.

In cardiology this selection is difficult and risky in every individual case. The current recommendations on pacemaker and defibrillator treatment as well as aftercare are presented with the aim of supporting the individual medical decisions with comprehensible and reliable arguments and to be able to justify these to the patients. In individual countries these considerations have led to a clear reduction in the implantation of pacemakers and defibrillators and also of ablation in cases of supraventricular arrhythmia. The impacts of the pandemic can be comprehended from the activity profiles of rhythmological implants. The necessity and opportunities for telemedical surveillance have become abundantly clear during this period as has the insufficient use and lack of structure of this technology. The current positive assessment by the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) for telemedical monitoring in cardiac insufficiency is a step in the right direction; however, the implementation and remuneration will lead to further discussions. A new algorithm, which is based on the recognition of heart sounds and is used in the first atrioventricular (AV) leadless cardiac pacemaker, is discussed. So far, the indications for a primarily prophylactic implantation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) have essentially been based on the left ventricular ejection fraction, especially in nonischemic cardiomyopathy.

Other uncommon aetiologies include tuberculosis, rheumatological diseases and post-viral pericarditis. Methods We present a case of an 80-year-old Caucasian man admitted with shortness of breath (NYHA III), skin rash, loss of weight and peripheral oedema. He had no other features of connective tissue disease (CTD) or vasculitis. His past medical history included atrial fibrillation, gout, hiatus hernia and he was on rivaroxaban, ramipril, digoxin, allopurinol, bumetanide, ranitidine and finasteride. Investigations showed NT pro BNP at 6473 ng/L, CRP at 78 mg/ dL and lymphopenia (0.42 10*9/L). He has persistent hyponatraemia at 117 mmol/L with normal kidney function. His liver function test showed alkaline phosphatase of 239 U/L and globulin at 41 g/L. His COVID-19 swab test was positive whereas mycobacterial culture and hepatitis screen were both negative. He had weakly positive ANA at 0.7 but otherwise normal autoimmune profile. The level of immunoglobulin G was 25 g/L and paraprotein of 2 g/L. His electrophoresis showed a monoclonal IgG; Kappa/Lambda ratio was 2.03. CT chest and cardiac MRI: shows constrictive pericarditis, pericardial effusion and thickening, moderate pleural effusion and ground-glass changes scattered throughout the right lung which suggested probably inflammatory origin. Thoracoscopic surgery (RVATS) was done for drainage of pleural effusion, excision of fat pad and anterior partial pericardectomy. The pericardial biopsy concluded chronic fibrous pericarditis with focal submesothelial mononuclear cell infiltrate with numerous plasma cells and lymphocytes .There was no amyloid or immunoglobulin deposition or malignancy. After the operation, there was both clinical and biochemical improvement (CRP- 28 mg/ dL). He did not need any immunomodulatory therapy. Results Cardiac involvement is rapidly emerging in COVID -19 diseases with case reports of myopericarditis, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, Kawasaki disease, thromboembolism, cardiogenic shock and aortitis. The mechanism remains unexplained but it could be related to direct endothelial inflammation or the cytokine storm sequelae. In our case, pericardial biopsy concluded features suggestive of autoimmune or immunoglobulin associated disease, although there was no clinical evidence of autoimmune disease. There were no lytic lesions and MGUS was diagnosed and scheduled for six monthly monitoring. Conclusion We report a case of constrictive pericarditis with COVID-19, although this remained a differential among the co-existed immunoglobulin and autoimmune syndrome. Appropriate imaging, biomarkers and histology investigations need to be considered for rapid evaluation and escalation of treatment. Cardiac manifestations are an important feature of COVID- 19. Further research is required to guide the management plans for similar cases. Disclosure Z. Alkutobi: None. G. Ansari: None. A.

This research explores the influence of COVID-19-related experiences on the emotional wellbeing and mental health of South African university students 3 months into the pandemic. Research data were obtained from an online survey completed by 5074 students. Students reported difficulties in coping with psychological challenges during the lockdown: 45.6% and 35.0% reported subjective experiences of anxiety and depression, respectively. Students scored low on the mental health continuum. Hierarchical stepwise multiple regression analyses showed that some different dimensions predicted emotional difficulties or wellbeing and mental health – confirming the two continuum theory of Keyes. Students’ serious discomfort during lockdown, difficulty adjusting academically and feeling socially isolated contributed most to emotional difficulties. Females, students in their early years of study and students residing in informal settlements were most at risk of experiencing emotional difficulties. Mental health was most predicted by students’ hopefulness. Social, academic, spiritual and physical wellbeing and positive coping strategies influenced both emotional difficulties and mental health. The research serves to alert university authorities to students’ emotional wellbeing, especially of first-year students and students with limited resources. The results could assist university psychological services to provide appropriate support services to enhance students’ adjustment and promote their mental health amid a public health crisis.","Visser, Maretha; Law-van Wyk, Eloise",S Afr J Psychol,382,16

(2) Assess the association between changes and restaurant type. METHODS: A random sample of HCRs (n = 89) offering Cuban, Dominican, Puerto Rican cuisine, were examined in Summer 2019 (T1) using the NEMS-HCR, an adapted version of the Nutrition Environment Measures Survey for Restaurants (NEMS-R) and reassessed after the onset of COVID-19 in January 2021 (T2, n = 76) using online menus. We examined menu changes between T1 and T2 data sets in the NEMS-HCR overall healthy food availability (HFA) score, and specific variables: the number of healthy main dish salads (HMDS) and the menu proportion of nonfried foods (NFF) on the menu. We then examined changes by restaurant type (sit-down vs. counter-style) using repeated measures ANOVA. RESULTS: Between T1 and T2, 7 HRCs permanently closed, 1 closed for the season, and 5 were excluded due to lack of online menus. Mean proportion of NFF significantly decreased from 71.7% ± 17.5 (T1) to 66.1% ± 17.8 (T2) (P = 0.002). Changes in HFA scores (4.5 ± 2.0 to 4.1 ± 2.2) and HMDS (1.7 ± 2.8 to 1.8 ± 3.0) were not statistically significant (P = 0.06 and P = 0.65, respectively). Repeated measures ANOVA indicated no correlation between the decrease in availability of NFF between T1 and T2 and restaurant type (P = 0.29). CONCLUSIONS: Restaurants can play a significant role in the mitigation of diet-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes by providing customers with healthy menu offerings. Our study showed a decrease in healthier menu options, particularly non-fried entrees, contributing to our understanding of how restaurants may need to adapt for their own survival in times of crisis such as a pandemic or disaster. Because unfavorable menu options can contribute to the rising incidence of diet-related chronic diseases within the community, more research is needed to understand how restaurants respond to crises in order to better support the preservation of HFA within their menu selections, and the effects of these changes in customers’ diets.

A disintegrin and metalloproteinase‐17 (ADAM17) is involved in the shedding of neprilysin and ACE2. We have reported the increase in renal angiotensin‐(1‐7) formation upon activation of angiotensin‐II type 2 receptor (AT(2)R). However, the modulation of expression and activity of these peptidases upon stimulation of AT(2)R in the kidney under the normal, obese, and high‐salt diet (HSD)‐fed condition is not known. Hence, we have treated, male, lean and obese Zucker rats (OZR) for 14 days without or with AT(2)R agonist C21 (1 mg/kg/day, via osmotic pumps) while fed HSD or normal diet. We have observed that the activity of neprilysin and ACE2 is decreased in the kidney of OZR fed either diet, however, only neprilysin activity has been found increased in the plasma (p<0.05). The C21‐treatment increased renal neprilysin expression and activity in the HSD‐fed OZR reflecting an increase in the urinary but decreased plasma activity (p<0.05). Likewise, The renal ACE2 expression is also increased upon C21‐treatment in HSD‐fed OZR and lean rats (p<0.05), but not the activity. These changes may be ascribed to ADAM17, as the renal expression of ADAM17 is paradoxically decreased upon HSD feeding in OZR (p<0.05) which is further reduced by C21‐treatment. Results indicate that AT(2)R activation differentially affects renal neprilysin and ACE2 which is critical in reference to current coronavirus pandemic.","Patel, Sanket; Hussain, Tahir",FASEB J,382,22

Methods: This study focused on methamphetamine addicts who were admitted to our hospital from January 2020 to December 2020 as the main research object, with a total of 89 cases. The patients were divided into a control group of 45 cases and a study group of 44 cases according to the treatment method. The control group was treated with electroacupuncture, and the study group was treated with paliperidone palmitate long-acting injection on the basis of electroacupuncture in the control group. After 6 months of continuous treatment, the treatment effect of methamphetamine withdrawal symptom score before and after treatment was used; Hamilton Anxiety Scale score and Hamilton Depression Scale were used to compare the anxiety and depression situation of the two groups; the brain wave α and θ wave situation of the two groups were compared. Result: The results showed that there was no significant difference in the scores of Ma withdrawal symptoms, Hamilton Anxiety and Hamilton Depression between the two groups before treatment (p < 0.05); after 3 and 6 months of treatment, the scores of Ma withdrawal symptoms, Hamilton Anxiety and Hamilton Depression in the study group were significantly lower than those in the control group and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05); 6 months after the completion of the treatment, the α wave amplitude and Fourier transformed α brain wave (FFT(α)) in the study group were significantly higher than those in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Paliperidone palmitate long-acting injection combined with electroacupuncture is better than electroacupuncture alone in the treatment of methamphetamine addicts, and can significantly improve anxiety, depression and brain waves, thereby preventing addicts from relapse.","Chen, Yu; Li, Mingchao; Ji, Qiuming; Su, Zou; Yang, Ziyu; Xu, Yin; Chen, Qian; Liao, Dan; Zeng, Jihua; Yang, Yuhong",Front Pharmacol,382,2

METHODS: A total of 120 patients with advanced-stage NSCLC were enrolled in this retrospective study and randomly assigned to a training dataset or validation dataset. Here, 462 radiomics features were extracted from region-of-interest (ROI) segmentation based on pretreatment CT images. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and logistic regression were applied to select radiomics features and develop combined models with clinical and morphological factors for PD-L1 expression and TMB status prediction. Ten-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the accuracy, and the predictive performance of these models was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC) analyses. RESULTS: The PD-L1-positive expression level correlated with differentiation degree (p = 0.005), tumor shape (p = 0.006), and vascular convergence (p = 0.007). Stage (p = 0.023), differentiation degree (p = 0.017), and vacuole sign (p = 0.016) were associated with TMB status. Radiomics signatures showed good performance for predicting PD-L1 and TMB with AUCs of 0.730 and 0.759, respectively. Predictive models that combined radiomics signatures with clinical and morphological factors dramatically improved the predictive efficacy for PD-L1 (AUC = 0.839) and TMB (p = 0.818). The results were verified in the validation datasets. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative CT-based radiomics features have potential value in the classification of PD-L1 expression levels and TMB status. The combined model further improved the predictive performance and provided sufficient information for the guiding of immunotherapy in clinical practice, and it deserves further analysis.","Wen, Qiang; Yang, Zhe; Dai, Honghai; Feng, Alei; Li, Qiang",Front Oncol,382,1

Several cases have been reported in children linking MIS-C with novel corona virus disease-2019 (COVID-19); however, few cases have been reported in adults [multi-system inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A)]. CASE SUMMARY: A case of a 20-year-old male patient with a history of COVID-19 infection 2 months before presentation who presented with fever and acute right lower quadrant pain. Workup revealed right-sided mesenteric lymphadenopathy and mild colitis that was non-responsive to antibiotics. The patient was found to have significantly elevated inflammatory markers. He also developed myocarditis resulting in acute systolic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The diagnosis of MIS-A was made by exclusion. The patient showed improvement with intravenous immunoglobulin and pulse steroids. Based on the available literature, MIS-C was defined till the age of 21; however, we think it is a misnomer for adults more than 18. Hence, we prefer to use MIS-A for our patient. CONCLUSION: It is essential to diagnose and treat patients with the multi-system inflammatory syndrome at an early stage; the management of these patients, especially with heart disease, should include immune-modulatory therapy as well as guideline-directed therapy.","Mittal, Nitish; Abohelwa, Mostafa; Brogan, Joshua; Nichols, Jacob",Eur Heart J Case Rep,382,1

This study was conducted to identify the current difficulties, worries regarding the next 2 months, and mental distress experienced by families with children on long-term KRT during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak and to deliver possible management approaches to ensure uninterrupted treatment for children on long-term KRT. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS A multicenter online survey was conducted between February 10 and 15, 2020, among the families with children on long-term KRT from five major pediatric dialysis centers in mainland China. The primary caregivers of children currently on long-term KRT were eligible and included. Demographic information, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection status, current difficulties, and worries regarding the next 2 months were surveyed using a self-developed questionnaire. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the General Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 were used to screen for depressive symptoms and anxiety, respectively. RESULTS Among the children in the 220 families included in data analysis, 113 (51%) children were on dialysis, and the other 107 (49%) had kidney transplants. No families reported confirmed or suspected cases of coronavirus disease 2019. Overall, 135 (61%) and 173 (79%) caregivers reported having difficulties now and having worries regarding the next 2 months, respectively.

The kinetics for M1 formation followed the Michaelis-Menten model in all species. Km , Vmax , and CLint values in humans were 602 µM, 466 pmol/min/mg protein, and 776 nL/min/mg protein in males, respectively, and 713 µM, 404 pmol/min/mg protein, and 567 nL/min/mg protein in females, respectively.

In our study, we observed that miR-105 was notably dysregulated in rat hearts with myocardial infarction (MI). Thus, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that miR-105 participates in the regulation of RIP3/p-MLKL- and BNIP3-dependent necroptosis/apoptosis in H9c2 cells and MI rat hearts. Our results show that the RIP3/p-MLKL necroptotic pathway and BNIP3-dependent apoptosis signaling are enhanced in H9c2 cells under hypoxic conditions, whereas, compared with these pathways in the controls, those in miR-105-treated H9c2 cells are suppressed. Mechanistically, we identified miR-105 as the miRNA directly suppressing the expression of RIP3 and BNIP3, two important mediators involved in cell necroptosis and apoptosis. Furthermore, MI rat hearts injected with miR-105 had decreased infarct sizes, indicating that miR-105 is among three miRNAs that function simultaneously to suppress necroptotic/apoptotic cell death pathways and to inhibit MI-induced cardiomyocyte cell death at multiple levels.

We demonstrated that super-lower concentrations of PAEs could be oxidized, which was due to their unique structure. POM molecules have been embedded onto graphene to form H5PMo10V2O40@surfactant(n)/Graphene(L wt%) (abbreviated as HPMoV@Surf(n)/GO(L wt%)) using surfactants with the carbon chain length n = 2, 4, 6 and 8 for the loading of HPMoV. The coexistence of the graphene and surfactant layer (on HPMoV@Surf(n)/GO(20 wt%)) adsorbed PAE molecules and transported them rapidly to HPMoV active sites. And n values determined the electron transfer ability between graphene and POMs that promoted PAEs oxidation. The loading of POMs on the surface of graphene permitted HPMoV@Surf(n)/GO(L wt%) act as interfacial catalyst which degraded various PAEs (i.e., diethyl phthalate (DEP), diallyl phthalate (DAP) and di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP)) while removed more than 70% of TOC and COD.

Barbed sutures help in avoiding this procedure, thus reducing intraoperative time and lowering blood loss and hospitalization time when compared to traditional sutures. Some cases of bowel occlusion following the use of barbed sutures have been described in literature. All of them are characterized by the entanglement of an intestinal loop in wire barbs with bowel occlusion symptoms. Case Presentation: We report two more cases which occurred in our Institute in 2020 and review those which have been reported in the literature by searching on Pubmed, Scopus, and Embase. We used the search terms: ""Barbed,"" ""Suture,"" ""Bowel,"" and ""Obstruction."" We examined in the literature the surgical procedures, the type of complications, the time to onset of the complications, and the type of barbed suture. Discussion: Twenty-two cases in total were reported in the literature from 2011 to 2020, and bowel complications were largely subsequent to interventions such as hernia surgical repair and myomectomy. In order to take advantage of barbed sutures while minimizing the risk of adverse events, such as intestinal occlusion, some precautions may be considered, such as the shortening of thread tails and use of antiadhesive barriers. Moreover, performing a few stitches backwards when ending the suture might be a useful suggestion. Further studies in this field may be useful in order to assess whether it might be better avoiding barbed suture application on serosal tissues to prevent bowel damage.","Stabile, Guglielmo; Romano, Federico; De Santo, Davide; Sorrentino, Felice; Nappi, Luigi; Cracco, Francesco; Ricci, Giuseppe",Frontiers in surgery,382,12

We also detected the level of interferon α (IFN-α) and interferon γ (IFN-γ) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results showed that IPEC-J2 cells exhibited a clear pathological change after PEDV infection at 24 h. In addition, TLR7, TLR9 and TLR10 expressions were significantly upregulated in PEDV-infected IPEC-J2 cells at 24 h. Interestingly, the expression patterns of TLR2 and TLR4 were consistent at different stages of PEDV infection. The expression level of TLR3 decreased significantly with the increase of infection time, but the expression levels of TLR5 and TLR8 genes at 6 h and 12 h were significantly lower than those in the control group (p⟨0.01). There were significant correlations among the expression levels of TLR genes (p⟨0.05). Cytokine detection showed that the secretion level of IFN-α in the PEDV-infected group was significantly higher than that in the control group (p⟨0.01), and IFN-γ at 6 h and 12 h after PEDV infection was significantly higher than that in control group (p⟨0.01). Therefore, our results suggest that PEDV infection can induce innate immune responses in intestinal porcine jejunum epithelial cells, leading to changes in the expression of Toll-like receptors, and can regulate the resistance to virus infection by affecting the release levels of downstream cytokines.","Wang, F; Wang, S Q; Wang, H F; Wu, Z C; Bao, W B; Wu, S L",Polish journal of veterinary sciences,382,11

METHODS Case report. CASE A 65-year-old woman taking chlorthalidone for hypertension presented to the emergency room with headache, pain, and blurry vision in both eyes and was found to be in bilateral acute angle closure. On laboratory investigation, she was severely hyponatremic and also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. B-scan ultrasound demonstrated an apparent supraciliary effusion in the right eye. Following stabilization of her intraocular pressures with medical management, she ultimately underwent cataract extraction with iridectomies and goniosynechiolysis in both eyes. CONCLUSIONS We report a rare case of bilateral acute angle closure glaucoma associated with hyponatremia. Chlorthalidone use and perhaps SARS-CoV-2 infection may have contributed to this electrolyte abnormality and unique clinical presentation. Additionally, we discuss the challenges of managing this complex patient with active SARS-CoV-2 infection during the pandemic.","Krawitz, Brian D; Sirinek, Portia; Doobin, David; Nanda, Tavish; Ghiassi, Maryam; Horowitz, Jason D; Liebmann, Jeffrey M; De Moraes, C Gustavo",Journal of glaucoma,382,24

The study of the genetic contribution to infectious diseases has undergone tremendous advances over the last decades. Here, focusing on genetic predisposition to fungal diseases, we provide an overview of the available approaches for studying human genetic susceptibility to infections, reviewing current methodological and practical limitations. We describe how the classical methods available, such as family-based studies and candidate-gene studies, have contributed to the discovery of crucial susceptibility factors for fungal infections. We will also discuss the contribution of novel unbiased approaches to the field, highlighting their success but also their limitations for the fungal immunology field. Finally, we show how a systems genomics approach can overcome those limitations and can lead to efficient prioritization and identification of genes and pathways with a critical role in susceptibility to fungal diseases. This knowledge will help stratify patients at risk groups and, subsequently, develop early appropriate prophylactic and treatment strategies.","Bruno, Mariolina; Matzaraki, Vasiliki; van de Veerdonk, Frank L; Kumar, Vinod; Netea, Mihai G",Infection and immunity,382,23

More than 60 VOCs were determined from 850 samples collected from four sites in and around the complexes through a 2-year monitoring campaign from 2005 to 2007. The VOCs of particular concern found in the area were benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, trichloroethylene, and formaldehyde, given their toxicity, concentration, and detection frequency. Toluene was the most abundant one. The VOC concentration rankings were consistent with their emission rankings. Most VOCs had higher concentrations at the industrial sites than at residential sites, indicating a significant impact of industrial emissions. The ambient levels of benzene and formaldehyde were additionally affected by vehicular emissions and secondary formation, respectively. Overall, the VOC levels increased in winter and at night, because of the local weather conditions. In contrast, the formaldehyde concentration increased in summer, owing to its secondary formation in the atmosphere. The ambient VOC levels in Sihwa-Banwol were higher than those in other parts of Korea. Additionally, the cumulative cancer risks posed by the toxic VOCs exceeded a tolerable risk level of 1 × 10-4 in not only the industrial areas but also the residential areas. The sum of the non-cancer risks in both areas significantly exceeded the threshold criterion of 1. The large amounts of aromatic compounds emitted from the industrial complexes are believed to play a crucial role in the elevated levels of surface ozone in the Seoul metropolitan area during the summer season. Therefore, comprehensive measures for controlling the VOC emissions in the Sihwa-Banwol area need to be prioritized to reduce the health risks for residents of not only this area but also the capital Seoul and its surrounding areas.","Kim, Min-Ji; Seo, Young-Kyo; Kim, Jong-Ho; Baek, Sung-Ok",Environmental science and pollution research international,382,1

However, the experiences of these women regarding access to care has been minimally described. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate and describe barriers to care for women with bleeding disorders. This study was a continuation of our previous work describing the lived experiences of these women. METHODS We undertook a qualitative descriptive study. Inclusion criteria for study enrollment were the following: age ≥ 18 years, English-speaking, and confirmed diagnosis of an inherited bleeding disorder. Women were recruited across Canada by treating healthcare providers and members of the Canadian Hemophilia Society. Telephone interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview style, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using descriptive thematic analysis. RESULTS A total of 15 participants were interviewed. Median age was 31 years (range 24-70 years). Four primary themes surrounding barriers to care emerged: 1. Lack of healthcare provider awareness of bleeding disorders, 2. Healthcare provider dismissal of symptoms, 3. Limited access to specialized care and treatment plans, and 4. Need for self-education and advocacy. DISCUSSION We found that women with inherited bleeding disorders experience tension with the healthcare system, feeling unheard and poorly understood. Based on our findings, we identified key knowledge and care gaps that could be addressed with awareness and educational initiatives: patient education on vaginal blood loss, updated medical curricula, clear referral guidelines, and tele-health initiatives for patients residing far from hemophilia treatment centres.","Arya, Sumedha; Wilton, Pamela; Page, David; Boma-Fischer, Laurence; Floros, Georgina; Winikoff, Rochelle; Teitel, Jerome; Dainty, Katie; Sholzberg, Michelle",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,382,16

Because drug seizures can serve as a proxy for drug availability, we examined shifts in drug seizures in the US during the pandemic. METHODS We examined trends in seizures of marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and fentanyl within five High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas-Washington/Baltimore, Chicago, Ohio, New Mexico, and North Florida. Trends were examined for number and total weight of seizures from March 2019 through September 2020 using Joinpoint regression. RESULTS Significant decreases in seizures involving marijuana (β = -0.03, P = 0.005) and methamphetamine (β = -0.02, P = 0.026) were detected through April 2020, and then seizures of marijuana (β = 0.10, P = 0.028) and methamphetamine (β = 0.11, P = 0.010) significantly increased through September 2020. The number of seizures involving marijuana and methamphetamine peaked in August 2020, exceeding the highest pre-COVID-19 number of seizures. Fentanyl seizures increased overall (β = 0.05, P < .001), but did not significantly drop during the start of COVID-19, and significant changes were not detected for cocaine or heroin. We also detected a significant increase in weight of marijuana seized from April through September 2020 (β = 0.40, P = .001). The weight of marijuana seized in August 2020 exceeded the highest pre-COVID-19 weight. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an immediate decrease in marijuana and methamphetamine seizures, and then increases throughout 2020 with some months exceeding the number (and weights) of seizures from the previous year. More research is warranted to determine the extent to which these seizures reflect changes in drug use.","Palamar, Joseph J; Le, Austin; Carr, Thomas H; Cottler, Linda B",Drug and alcohol dependence,382,23

METHODS Ten patients underwent HALS Dev+Sp as a treatment for esophagogastric varices between 2005 and 2012 (HALS group). A vessel-sealing system was used for devascularization of vessels. An autosuture device was applied to dissect the splenic hilum and the left gastric and enlarged short gastric vessels. The operative and postoperative data were compared between patients who previously underwent laparoscopic Dev+Sp (LAP group, n = 9) and conventional Dev+Sp (OP group, n = 10) between 2001 and 2008. RESULTS The mean operative time was 328, 336, and 245 min (P < 0.05) and the mean blood loss was 1786, 981, and 250 mL (P < 0.05) in the OP, LAP, and HALS groups, respectively. Laparoscopic surgery was converted to HALS in one patient and to open surgery in three patients. There were no conversions in the HALS group. There was no significant difference in the cumulative recurrence rate and bleeding rate in the groups.

To overcome the problem of cross-contamination due to fouling of the electrode surface in traditional DMBs, a contactless liquid handling biochip technology, referred to as acoustofluidics, has recently been proposed. A major challenge in operating this platform is the need for a control signal of frequency 24 MHz and voltage range +-10/+-20 V to activate the IDT units in the biochip. In this paper, we present a hardware design that can efficiently activate/de-activated each IDT, and can fully automate an bioprotocol.

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and cohort studies comparing interventions to standard therapy, placebo or pre-post cohort comparisons for more than 4 weeks were included. The outcome included self-reported scales compared at baseline and a therapeutic time point. Risk of bias was evaluated by using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale. A total of 2812 articles were narrowed down to 309 for full-text screening. Four RCTs and one prospective cohort study, with a total of 634 JSLE patients, met the inclusion criteria. Four of the studies had a controlled intervention plus standard therapy compared with standard therapy alone or placebo. Multiple indices were used to evaluate HRQoL. These included the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire, Simple Measure of Impact of Lupus Erythematosus in Youngsters tool, Kids Fatigue Severity Scale and Child Depression Inventory. A single study reported a significant improvement while remaining studies reported no difference or failed to report the statistical analysis. Although HRQoL is significantly impaired in JSLE, evidence regarding its improvement is limited due to the small number of eligible studies, heterogeneity in scales, and HRQoL domains. A universal HRQoL questionnaire for JSLE needs to be established and used in both the research and clinical setting.

Therefore, considerable efforts have been made to develop innovative methods and technologies for suppressing the spread of viruses as well as inactivating the viruses but COVID-19 vaccines are still in the development phase. This perspective focuses on the sensing, detection and therapeutic applications of CoVs using inorganic-based nanomaterials, metal complexes, and metal-conjugates. Synthetic inorganic-based nanoparticles interact strongly with proteins of viruses due to their morphological similarities, and therefore, numerous antivirals have been tested for efficacy against different viruses in vitro through colorimetric and electrochemical assays. Metal complexes-based agents such as bismuth complexes form attractive class of drugs with a number of therapeutic applications including the inhibition and duplex-unwinding activity of SARS-CoV helicase by quantitative real-time PCR (Q-RT-PCR), phosphate release assay and radioassay studies.

The release of phenolic compounds from the food matrix during digestion is an important pre-requisite for their effectiveness within the human body, so it is fundamental to identify technological treatments able to preserve not only the concentration of phytochemicals but also their bioaccessibility. In this study we investigated the impact of high-pressure homogenization (HPH), alone and in the presence of 100 g kg-1 trehalose or Lactobacillus salivarius, on bioaccessibility of flavonoids in mandarin juice. In addition, digested mandarin juices were supplemented to liver cultured cells in basal and stressed condition to evaluate their protective effect in a biological system. RESULTS HPH reduced the concentration of total phenolics and main flavonoids but increased their bioaccessibility after in vitro digestion (p < 0.001). In basal condition, supplementation with all digested juices significantly reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentration (p < 0.001). Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances concentration in the medium was also reduced by supplementation with HPH-treated juices. Although pre-treatment with juices did not completely counteract the applied oxidative stress it preserved cell viability, and cells pre-treated with juices submitted to HPH in the presence of probiotics showed the lowest ROS concentration.

To investigate this, we performed a retrospective review of all 1,167 patients from the Mayo Clinic Fontan database. Thirteen percent (153 patients) had AVV repair or replacement during their staged single ventricle palliation. We found that patients with right ventricular morphology and common AVV were at increased risk for AVV intervention. Patients who underwent AVV intervention had increased risk of death/transplant compared to those who did not (hazards ratio (HR)=1.75, 95% CI 1.37-2.23, p<0.001). With respect to valve intervention timing, while AVV intervention prior to Fontan presented similar risk for death/transplant compared to no AVV intervention (HR=0.85, 95% CI 0.32-2.27, p=0.74), intervention at time of Fontan had a significantly higher risk (HR=1.46, 95% CI 1.09-1.97, p=0.01), and intervention after Fontan had a much more substantial risk (HR=3.83, 95% CI 2.54-5.79, p<0.001). AVV repair failure occurred in 11% of patients. In terms of relative risk of valve repair versus replacement, in post-Fontan AVV intervention patients, AVV replacement carried a 2.9 fold risk of death/transplant compared to AVV repair. In conclusion, AVV disease remains a considerable challenge for durable Fontan physiology. This data demonstrates that earlier intervention on valve pathology improves survival with the Fontan circulation. Continued surveillance of single ventricle patients and prompt referral of those with valve pathology can improve outcomes in this challenging population.","Stephens, Elizabeth H; Dearani, Joseph A; Niaz, Talha; Arghami, Arman; Phillips, Sabrina D; Cetta, Frank",The American journal of cardiology,382,1

OBJECTIVE To investigate the incidence and nature of impaired wound healing and complications at a single transplantation center in Norway. PATIENTS Of 226 patients who underwent KTx, 199 (87%) were followed up prospectively for 1 year (2005) via close and meticulous wound inspection. RESULTS The study revealed a high rate of wound complications (200-250/y) in a high-volume center. Fifty-four patients (27%) experienced prolonged wound healing, defined as gaps, secretions, or wound complications, at 3 to 5 weeks posttransplantation, and 41 patients (21%) had impaired wound healing, defined as gaps, secretions, or wound complications after 5 weeks posttransplantation. In total, 50 patients (25%) required surgical or radiologic reintervention. Complications included lymphocele in 29 patients (14.6%), wound dehiscence in 16 (8.0%), bleeding or hematoma in 10 (5.0%), and infection in 9 (4.5%). Risk factors associated with wound complications included recipient older than 60 years, body mass index greater than 30, hemoglobin concentration less than 10 g/dL, albumin concentration less than 36 g/dL, duration of surgery more than 200 minutes, no subcutaneous sutures, and sirolimus or everolimus therapy. At nominal and logistic regression analysis, recipient older than 60 years, body mass index greater than 30, and no subcutaneous sutures were independent risk factors. CONCLUSION Risk factor analysis and previous documentation suggest that wound complications might be counteracted using the following measures: subcutaneous sutures, predialysis transplantation, sealing or ligation of lymphatic trunks, prophylactic fenestration, reduction of corticosteroid load, and avoiding sirolimus/everolimus therapy.","Røine, E; Bjørk, I T; Oyen, O",Transplantation proceedings,382,8

Advances in nanomedicine-based contrast agents in MRI scanning of MS lesions, and nanomedicine-derived sensors for detecting biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid biopsy or analyzing the composition of exhaled breath gas have demonstrated the potential of using nanomedicines in accurate diagnosis of MS. This review aims to provide an overview of recent advances in application of nanomedicines for the diagnosis of MS and conclude with perspectives of using nanomedicines for development of safe and effective MS diagnostic nano-tools.","Zhang, Qin; Dai, Xinghang; Zhang, Hu; Zeng, Yujun; Luo, Kui; Li, Weimin",Biomedical materials,382,19

This paper aimed to explore current literature on the alcohol-related knowledge, beliefs, attitudes and expectancies of children aged 12years and under. Electronic databases were searched for papers published from January 2000-August 2016. Further papers were identified by a manual review of reference lists, and contacting corresponding authors of included papers. Papers that reported on children's knowledge or beliefs about alcohol, attitudes towards alcohol and/or expectancies regarding alcohol consumption were included. Seventeen cross-sectional, experimental or observational studies and seven longitudinal studies met the inclusion criteria. Data on key measures was tabulated. From a very young age children are aware of and able to identify alcohol, and have some knowledge of its effects; their attitudes become more positive with increasing age and these shifts appear to precede drinking initiation by some years. The small number of available studies, with different measures of knowledge, attitudes and expectancies, made assessment of bias unfeasible. Only three studies were published in the last five years. Children's knowledge of, and attitudes towards, alcohol form before they initiate alcohol use, and are likely acquired through observation. Alcohol-related education should commence before children begin drinking, and should encourage the delay of alcohol initiation, address social norms, and reduce positive expectancies.","Jones, Sandra C; Gordon, Chloe S",Preventive medicine,382,1

Subsequently we developed the telesimulation education platform: TeleSimBox. We hypothesized that this remote simulation platform would be feasible and acceptable for faculty use and a perceived effective method for medical student education. Methods Twenty-one telesimulations were conducted with students and educators at four U.S. medical schools. Sessions were run by cofacilitator dyads with four to 10 clerkship-level students per session. Facilitators were provided training materials. User-perceived effectiveness and acceptability were evaluated via descriptive analysis of survey responses to the Modified Simulation Effectiveness Tool (SET-M), Net Promoter Score (NPS), and Likert-scale questions. Results Approximately one-quarter of students and all facilitators completed surveys. Users perceived that the sessions were effective in teaching medical knowledge and teamwork, though less effective for family communication and skills. Users perceived that the telesimulations were comparable to other distance learning and to in-person simulation. The tool was overall positively promoted. Conclusion Users overall positively scored our medical student telesimulation tool on the SET-M objectives and promoted the experience to colleagues on the NPS. The next steps are to further optimize the tool.","Sanseau, Elizabeth; Lavoie, Megan; Tay, Khoon-Yen; Good, Grace; Tsao, Suzana; Burns, Rebekah; Thomas, Anita; Heckle, Tanner; Wilson, Meghan; Kou, Maybelle; Auerbach, Marc",AEM education and training,382,22

This type of invasion is exhibited by a variety of cancer types, and very frequently is found in pancreatic cancer. The microscopic size of nerve fibers within mouse pancreas renders the study of PNI difficult in orthotopic murine models. Here, we describe a heterotopic in vivo model of PNI, where we inject syngeneic pancreatic cancer cell line Panc02-H7 into the murine sciatic nerve. In this model, sciatic nerves of anesthetized mice are exposed and injected with cancer cells. The cancer cells invade in the nerves proximally toward the spinal cord from the point of injection. The invaded sciatic nerves are then extracted and processed with OCT for frozen sectioning. H&E and immunofluorescence staining of these sections allow quantification of both the degree of invasion and changes in protein expression. This model can be applied to a variety of studies on PNI given its versatility. Using mice with different genetic modifications and/or different types of cancer cells allows for investigation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of PNI and for different cancer types. Furthermore, the effects of therapeutic agents on nerve invasion can be studied by applying treatment to these mice.","Deborde, Sylvie; Yu, Yasong; Marcadis, Andrea; Chen, Chun-Hao; Fan, Ning; Bakst, Richard L; Wong, Richard J",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,382,31

Training in telehealth allows access to health care for vulnerable populations in rural health areas and beyond. As the future of health care delivery changes, providers will be required to use this technology. Therefore, it is imperative that such training become part of NP education to prepare students to be technologically competent providers in the 21st century. The objective of this educational pilot project was to educate Doctor of Nursing Practice nurse practitioner students to conduct patient interviews and provide interprofessional collaboration using telehealth. The project addressed a gap in the literature on planning for simulations from varying NP specialties and provided feedback from standardized patients on their experiences. A total of 83 students from four specialty tracks received telehealth education. Students then interviewed simulated patients and provided a collaborating report. The students and patients were asked to complete questionnaires to assess the modules and the experience itself. Quantitative descriptive data were gathered, and qualitative themes were obtained from open-ended questions. Both the students and simulated patients indicated that they appreciated the ease and convenience of interviewing patients through technology. Both struggled with issues related to the technology and the need to have backup systems available. The students demonstrated that they were very capable of using telehealth and were generally very positive about the experience.","Love, Rene; Carrington, Jane M",Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners,382,11

ApeC-containing proteins (ACPs) have been found in various marine and aquatic invertebrates, but their functions and the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Early studies suggested that amphioxus ACP1 and ACP2 bind to bacterial cell walls and have a role in immunity. Here we identified another two amphioxus ACPs (ACP3 and ACP5), which belong to the same phylogenetic clade with ACP1/2, but show distinct expression patterns and sequence divergence (40-50% sequence identities). Both ACP3 and ACP5 were mainly expressed in the intestine and hepatic cecum, and could be up-regulated after bacterial challenge. Both prokaryotic-expressed recombinant ACP3 and ACP5 could bind with several species of bacteria and yeasts, showing agglutinating activity but no microbicidal activity. ELISA assays suggested that their ApeC domains could interact with peptidoglycan (PGN), but not with lipoteichoic acid (LTA), lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and zymosan A. Furthermore, they can only bind to Lys-type PGN from Staphylococcus aureus, but not to DAP-type PGN from Bacillus subtilis and not to moieties of PGN such as MDPs, NAMs and NAGs. This recognition spectrum is different from that of ACP1/2. We also found that when expressed in mammalian cells, ACP3 could interact with TRAF6 via a conserved non-ApeC region, which inhibited the ubiquitination of TRAF6 and hence suppressed downstream NF-κB activation. This work helped define a novel subfamily of ACPs, which have conserved structures, and have related yet diversified molecular functions. Its members have dual roles, with ApeC as a lectin and a conserved unknown region as a signal transduction regulator. These findings expand our understanding of the ACP functions and may guide future research on the role of ACPs in different animal clades.","Li, Jin; Li, Yuhui; Fan, Zhaoyu; Chen, Shenghui; Yan, Xinyu; Yue, Zirui; Huang, Guangrui; Liu, Shumin; Zhang, Hao; Chen, Shangwu; Dong, Meiling; Xu, Anlong; Huang, Shengfeng",Frontiers in immunology,382,1

In this report, a model N-S-N(Py) ligand (3) and a cysteine-derived α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) peptide (6) were used as novel demonstrations of a widely applicable chelation strategy for incorporation of the [M(I)(CO)(3)](+) (M = Re, (99m)Tc) core into peptide-based molecules for radiopharmaceutical applications. The structural details of the core ligand-metal complexes as model systems were demonstrated by full chemical characterization of fac-[Re(I)(CO)(3)(N,S,N(Py)-3)](+) (4) and comparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis between 4 and [(99m)Tc(I)(CO)(3)(N,S,N(Py)-3)](+) (4a). The α-MSH analogue bearing the N-S-N(Py) chelate on a modified cysteine residue (6) was generated and complexed with [M(I)(CO)(3)](+) to confirm the chelation strategy's utility when applied in a peptide-based targeting agent. Characterization of the Re(I)(CO)(3)-6 peptide conjugate (7) confirmed the efficient incorporation of the metal center, and the (99m)Tc(I)(CO)(3)-6 analogue (7a) was explored as a potential single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) compound for imaging the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) in melanoma. Peptide 7a showed excellent radiolabeling yields and in vitro stability during amino acid challenge and serum stability assays. In vitro B16F10 melanoma cell uptake of 7a reached a modest value of 2.3 ± 0.08% of applied activity at 2 h at 37 °C, while this uptake was significantly reduced by coincubation with a nonlabeled α-MSH analogue, NAPamide (3.2 μM) (P < 0.05). In vivo SPECT/X-ray computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging and biodistribution of 7a were evaluated in a B16F10 melanoma xenografted mouse model. SPECT/CT imaging clearly visualized the tumor at 1 h post injection (p.i.) with high tumor-to-background contrast. Blocking studies with coinjected NAPamide (10 mg per kg of mouse body weight) confirmed the in vivo specificity of 7a for MC1R-positive tumors. Biodistribution results with 7a yielded a moderate tumor uptake of 1.20 ± 0.09 percentage of the injected radioactive dose per gram of tissue (% ID/g) at 1 h p.i. Relatively high uptake of 7a was also seen in the kidneys and liver at 1 h p.i. (6.55 ± 0.36% ID/g and 4.44 ± 0.17% ID/g, respectively), although reduced kidney uptake was seen at 4 h p.i. (3.20 ± 0.48% ID/g). These results demonstrate the utility of the novel [M(I)(CO)(3)](+) chelation strategy when applied in a targeting peptide.","Jiang, Han; Kasten, Benjamin B; Liu, Hongguang; Qi, Shibo; Liu, Yang; Tian, Mei; Barnes, Charles L; Zhang, Hong; Cheng, Zhen; Benny, Paul D",Bioconjugate chemistry,382,5

To evaluate the potential of African bat henipaviruses to spread in non-bat mammalian cells, we compared the biological functions of the surface glycoproteins G and F of the prototype African henipavirus GH-M74a with those of the glycoproteins of Nipah virus (NiV), a well-characterized pathogenic member of the henipavirus genus. Glycoproteins are central determinants for virus tropism, as efficient binding of henipavirus G proteins to cellular ephrin receptors and functional expression of fusion-competent F proteins are indispensable prerequisites for virus entry and cell-to-cell spread. In this study, we analysed the ability of the GH-M74a G and F proteins to cause cell-to-cell fusion in mammalian cell types readily permissive to NiV or Hendra virus infections. Except for limited syncytium formation in a bat cell line derived from Hypsignathus monstrosus, HypNi/1.1 cells, we did not observe any fusion. The highly restricted fusion activity was predominantly due to the F protein. Whilst GH-M74a G protein was found to interact with the main henipavirus receptor ephrin-B2 and induced syncytia upon co-expression with heterotypic NiV F protein, GH-M74a F protein did not cause evident fusion in the presence of heterotypic NiV G protein. Pulse-chase and surface biotinylation analyses revealed delayed F cleavage kinetics with a reduced expression of cleaved and fusion-active GH-M74a F protein on the cell surface. Thus, the F protein of GH-M74a showed a functional defect that is most likely caused by impaired trafficking leading to less efficient proteolytic activation and surface expression.","Weis, Michael; Behner, Laura; Hoffmann, Markus; Krüger, Nadine; Herrler, Georg; Drosten, Christian; Drexler, Jan Felix; Dietzel, Erik; Maisner, Andrea",The Journal of general virology,382,31

OBJECTIVE This study prospectively evaluates the COVID-19 related patient risk and skin cancer management at a single tertiary referral centre, which rapidly implemented national COVID-19 safety guidelines. METHOD A prospective cohort study was performed in all patients who underwent surgery for elective skin cancer service management, during the UK COVID-19 pandemic peak (April-May 2020). 'Real-time' 30-day hospital database deceased data were collected. Random selection was undertaken for patients who either underwent operative (surgery group) management or remained on the waiting list (control group); these groups were also prospectively followed-up within a controlled cohort study design and telephoned at the end of June 2020 for the control group or 30 days post-operatively. RESULTS Of the 767 patients who had operations, there were no COVID-19 related deaths. Both the surgery (n = 384) and control (n = 100) groups were matched for age, sex, ethnicity, BMI, presence of comorbidities, smoking and positive COVID-19 contact. There were no differences in post-operative versus any symptom development (1.3%, 5/384 vs. 4%, 4/100, p = 0.093), or proportion of positive tests (8.6%, 33/384 vs. 8%, 8/100; p = 0.849), between the surgery and control groups. CONCLUSION These data support continued and safe service provision, and no increased risk to skin cancer patients who require surgical management, which is vital for continuation of cancer treatment in the context of a pandemic.

METHODS AND RESULTS We examined the records of 650 consecutive patients who underwent CTO percutaneous coronary intervention between 2011 and 2014 at 6 experienced centers in the United States. Six hundred and fifty-seven lesions were classified as easy (J-CTO=0), intermediate (J-CTO=1), difficult (J-CTO=2), and very difficult (J-CTO≥3). The impact of the J-CTO score on technical success and procedure time was evaluated with univariable logistic and linear regression, respectively. The performance of the logistic regression model was assessed with the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic and receiver operator characteristic curves. Antegrade wiring techniques were used more frequently in easy lesions (97%) than very difficult lesions (58%), whereas the retrograde approach became more frequent with increased lesion difficulty (41% for very difficult lesions versus 13% for easy lesions). The logistic regression model for technical success demonstrated satisfactory calibration and discrimination (P for Hosmer-Lemeshow =0.743 and area under curve =0.705). The J-CTO score was associated with a 2-fold increase in the odds of technical failure (odds ratio 2.04, 95% confidence interval 1.52-2.80, P<0.001). Procedure time increased by ≈20 minutes for every 1-point increase of the J-CTO score (regression coefficient 22.33, 95% confidence interval 17.45-27.22, P<0.001).

The objectives of the study were to analyze the anatomy of dural AVFs, their endovascular treatment strategies, and clinical outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two centers retrospectively selected patients treated between January 2009 and June 2018 having posterior fossa dural AVFs. We collected patient demographics, clinical presentation, arterial and venous outflow anatomy of the dural AVFs, and treatment outcomes. RESULTS Twenty-six patients treated endovascularly for posterior fossa dural AVFs, type III, IV, or V, were included. One hundred percent of the dural AVFs were occluded. A transarterial approach was performed in 23 dural AVFs (88.5%); a combined transarterial and transvenous approach, for 2 dural AVFs (7.7%); and a transvenous approach alone, for 1 dural AVF (3.8%).

Various biological activities such as anti-tumorous, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and immunomodulatory function are influenced by Sclareol, as a natural diterpene compound. However, studies on the effect and mechanism of Sclareol on osteoporosis are rare. In the current research, the influence of Sclareol on osteoclastogenesis and osteoblastogenesis was targeted to be discovered in ovariectomy (OVX)-induced animal models and in vitro. The expression levels of osteoclast-related genes such as c-Fos, NFATc1, and CTSK were detected by RT-qPCR and western blotting to understand the inhibition of Sclareol on the creation of osteoclast. The influence of Sclareol on osteoblastogenesis and the expression of osteoblastogenic markers were also examined. Sclareol inhibited the osteoclastogenesis caused by receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) which promoted osteoblastogenesis through upregulating the expression of cysteine-rich protein 61 (CYR61/CCN1), which is a matricellular protein of the CCN family. The p-ERK and p-P38 protein expression levels were considerably downregulated by Sclareol. Furthermore, CCN1 overexpression partially mimicked the inhibitory effect of Sclareol, while the opposite results were obtained after CCN1 silencing. Additionally, Sclareol protected against loss of bones in an osteoporosis mouse model generated by OVX. The acquired results indicated that Sclareol represses RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and promotes osteoblastogenesis via promoting the expression of CCN1 by constraining the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Our findings proposed that for the avoidance and treatment of osteoclast-linked disorders, Sclareol is a potentially effective drug. A proposed model for mediated regulation of osteoclastogenesis and osteoblastogenesis by Sclareol. The basic model of the process by which Sclareol prevents osteoclastogenesis and promotes osteoblastogenesis. Sclareol may increase the expression of CCN1 through inhibiting the MAPK pathway, thereby inhibiting osteoclast differentiation and attenuating bone resorption. Sclareol represses the expression of c-Fos, which stimulates the formation of osteoclast. In contrast, Sclareol promotes osteoblast differentiation by upregulating Runx2 expression, thereby improving the formation of bones. Consequently, Sclareol protects against loss of bones by regulating the stability of bone makeover via inhibition of bone formation and stimulation of bone resorption. Graphical Headlights 1. Sclareol represses RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. 2. Sclareol promotes osteoblast differentiation. 3. Sclareol inhibits the MAPK pathway through induction of CCN1. 4.

Methods: This systematic review investigates the potential link between cannabis use and occupational injury. Consequently, it appraises all available current literature from five databases, following Cochrane and PRISMA guidelines. Results: Seven of the 16 reviewed studies show evidence supporting a positive association between cannabis use and occupational injury. One study shows evidence supporting a negative association and the remaining eight studies show no evidence of a significant relation. None of the studies assessed cannabis-related impairment. Only three of the reviewed studies show clear evidence that cannabis use preceded the occupational-injury event. Conclusion: The current body of evidence does not provide sufficient evidence to support the position that cannabis users are at increased risk of occupational injury. Further, the study quality assessment suggests significant biases in the extant literature are present due to potential confounding variables, selection of participants, and measurement of exposures and outcomes. Future high-quality evidence will be needed to elucidate the relation between cannabis use and occupational injury.","Biasutti, Wade R; Leffers, Kurt S H; Callaghan, Russell C",Substance use & misuse,382,5

Clinically the cat was obese, pyrexic (39.8 °C), had acute abdominal pain and severe bilirubinuria. Haematology and serum biochemistry revealed severe panleukopenia, thrombocytopenia, markedly elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and five-fold increased pre-prandial bile acids. Ultrasonographic evaluation of the abdomen did not identify any abnormalities. Serum tests for feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) were negative. Broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment for infectious hepatitis was to no avail; the cat deteriorated and died 72 h after admission. Necropsy revealed mild icterus and anaemia, severe multifocal hepatic necrosis, serofibrinous hydrothorax, pulmonary oedema and interstitial pneumonia. Histopathology confirmed the macroscopic findings and revealed multifocal microgranulomata in the brain and myocardium, as well as areas of necrosis in lymph nodes and multifocally in splenic red pulp. Long bone shaft marrow was hyperplastic with a predominance of leukocyte precursors and megakaryocytes and splenic red pulp showed mild extramedullary haemopoiesis. Immunohistochemical staining for Toxoplasma gondii was strongly positive, with scattered cysts and tachyzoites in the liver, lymph nodes, spleen, lungs, brain, salivary glands and intracellularly in round cells in occasional blood vessels. Immunohistochemical staining for corona virus on the same tissues was negative, ruling out feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on formalin-fixed paraffin-wax embedded tissues was positive for Toxoplasma sp., but attempts at sequencing were unsuccessful. This was the first case report of fulminant disseminated toxoplasmosis in South Africa, in which detailed histopathology in an apparently immunocompetent cat was described.","Nagel, Susanna S; Williams, June H; Schoeman, Johannes P",Journal of the South African Veterinary Association,382,1

Intense activities in megacities induce high levels of air pollutants in the atmosphere that harm human health, cause regional haze and acid deposition, damage crops, influence air quality in regions far from the megacity sources, and contribute to climate change. Since the Great London Smog and the first recognized episode of Los Angeles photochemical smog seventy years ago, substantial progress has been made in improving the scientific understanding of air pollution and in developing emissions reduction technologies. However, much remains to be understood about the complex processes of atmospheric oxidation mechanisms; the formation and evolution of secondary particles, especially those containing organic species; and the influence of emerging emissions sources and changing climate on air quality and health. While air quality has substantially improved in megacities in developed regions and some in the developing regions, many still suffer from severe air pollution. Strong regional and international collaboration in data collection and assessment will be beneficial in strengthening the capacity. This article provides an overview of the sources of emissions in megacities, atmospheric physicochemical processes, air quality trends and management in a few megacities, and the impacts on health and climate. The challenges and opportunities facing megacities due to lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic is also discussed.","Molina, Luisa T",Faraday discussions,382,1

This group of viruses is named so as they exhibit characteristic crown-like spikes on their protein coat. SARS-CoV-2, a type of coronavirus that emerged in 2019, causes severe infection in the lower respiratory tract of humans and is often fatal in immunocompromised individuals. No medications have been approved so far for the direct treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the currently available treatment options rely on relieving the symptoms. The medicinal plants occurring in nature serve as a rich source of active ingredients that could be utilized for developing pharmacopeial and non-pharmacopeial/synthetic drugs with antiviral properties. Compounds obtained from certain plants have been used for directly and selectively inhibiting different coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. The present review discusses the potential natural inhibitors against the highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, with a systematic elaboration on the possible mechanisms of action of these natural compounds while acting in the different stages of the life cycle of coronaviruses. Moreover, through a comprehensive exploration of the existing literature in this regard, the importance of such compounds in the research and development of effective and safe antiviral agents is discussed. We focused on the mechanism of action of several natural compounds along with their target of action. In addition, the immunomodulatory effects of these active components in the context of human health are elucidated. Finally, it is suggested that the use of traditional medicinal plants is a novel and feasible remedial strategy against human coronaviruses.","Guguloth, Sai Krishna; Lakshmi A R,; Rajendran, Radhika; Rajaram, Kaushik; Chinnasamy, Thirunavukkarasu; Huang, Jian-Dong; Zhang, Hongjie; Senapati, Sanjib; Durairajan, Siva Sundara Kumar",Current drug targets,382,1

The purpose of this article is to discuss the clinical utility of 1H-MRS in determining CNS involvement in individuals with rheumatic autoimmune diseases. METHODS This study is a systematic review of the literature, conducted during the month of November and December of 2019 of articles published in the last 16 years (2003-2019). The search for relevant references was done through the exploration of electronic databases (PubMed/Medline and Embase). We searched for studied including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, Sjögren's syndrome (pSS), vasculitis and Behçet. Only studies published after 2003 and with more than 20 patients were included. RESULTS We included 26 articles. NAA/Cr ratios were significant lower and Cho/Cr ratios increased in several brain regions in SLE, SS, RA, SSc. Associations with disease activity, inflammatory markers, CNS manifestations and comorbidities was variable across studies and diseases. CONCLUSION The presence of neurometabolite abnormalities in patients without ouvert CNS manifestations, suggests that systemic inflammation, atherosclerosis or abnormal vascular reactivity may be associated with subclinical CNS manifestations.

STUDY DESIGN Prospective cohort study of measurement of SpO2 over 6 h in 20 late-preterm (35 to 36 weeks gestation) and 40 term infants within 12 to 48 h of birth was conducted. Infants with cardiorespiratory symptoms or need for cardiorespiratory support at birth were excluded. Percentage time spent at SpO2 >90% and ⩽90% was calculated by gestational age and birth weight. RESULT Late-preterm infants and infants born weighing <2.5 kg spent approximately 7% of the time at SpO2 ⩽90%; this time decreased as gestational age and birth weight increased. Time at SpO2 >90% was significantly different between late-preterm and term infants (93% (5%) vs 96% (3%); P =0.002).

However, understanding the molecular biology and the role of the endothelium in different pathological conditions remains insufficient. The purpose of the study was to characterize and analyze the molecular aspect of harvested ECs using cell culture and transcriptomic techniques in an MT swine model relevant to clinical ischemic stroke. METHODS In swine, preformed thrombi were injected into the external carotid and subclavian arteries to occlude their branches. MT was performed according to clinical routine. The stent retriever device and thrombus were treated with cell dissociation buffer. The resulting cell suspension was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and was cultured. Cultured cells were analyzed using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) after fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). RESULTS A total number of 37 samples were obtained containing CD31-positive cells. Cell culture was successful in 90% of samples, and the cells expressed multiple typical EC protein markers. Eighty-nine percent of the sorted cells yielded high-quality transcriptomes, and single-cell transcriptomes from cultured cells showed that they expressed typical endothelial gene patterns. Gene expression analysis of ECs from an occluded artery did not show distinctive clustering into subtypes. CONCLUSION ECs harvested during MT can be cultured and analyzed using single-cell transcriptomic techniques. This analysis can be implemented in clinical practice to study the EC gene expression of comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome, in patients suffering from acute ischemic stroke.","Jaff, Nasren; Grankvist, Rikard; Muhl, Lars; Chireh, Arvin; Sandell, Mikael; Jonsson, Stefan; Arnberg, Fabian; Eriksson, Ulf; Holmin, Staffan",Neuroradiology,382,19

(2) To compare the histologic distribution of USPIO-related iron particles (USPIO-IPs) with the USPIO-enhancement area in the early vascular and in the cellular imaging phase (E- and L-phase, respectively) after intravenous CA administration. METHODS We performed USPIO-enhanced MRI of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced endogenous rat glioma, including spin-echo (SE) T1-weighted images (T1WIs) and gradient-recalled-echo (GRE) T2-weighted images (T2WIs), before and at 3-6 h after USPIO-CA administration for E-phase images. For L-phase images, MRI was performed at 16-19 and 62-69 h after administration. Two observers determined the USPIO-enhancement area on E-phase images and Gd-enhancement areas. We compared the USPIO-enhancement size (USPIO-ES) and Gd-ES on SE T1WIs, and the hypo-intense USPIO-ES on GRE T2WIs and Gd-ES using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. In addition, two raters visually evaluated the correspondence between the histologic distribution of USPIO-IPs and the USPIO-enhancement area on corresponding GRE T2WIs at each phase using a 3-rating scale. RESULTS Significantly smaller hyper-intense, hypo-intense and combined hyper-/hypo-intense areas were observed on USPIO-enhanced SE T1WIs compared with Gd-enhanced images (all P < 0.001). The hypo-intense USPIO-ES on GRE T2WIs was significantly smaller than the Gd-ES (P = 0.001). The distribution of USPIO-IPs on histopathological specimen and USPIO-enhancement on GRE T2WIs exhibited poor agreement in 5 of 9 tumors with enhancement from rats sacrificed early. The distribution of microglia containing USPIO-IPs corresponded with the pattern of USPIO-enhancement in the 2 tumors with late enhancement. CONCLUSION The enhancement pattern and size of USPIO-CA in a rat glioma model were statistically different from those of Gd-BCA. Our histological data suggests that USPIO-enhanced MRI offers vascular bed imaging in E-phase and might depict the intra-tumoral distribution of immune effector cells in L-phase.","Yamamoto, Atsuko; Takaki, Kai; Morikawa, Shigehiro; Murata, Kiyoshi; Ito, Ryuta",Magnetic resonance in medical sciences : MRMS : an official journal of Japan Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine,382,1

Collateralized vessel intensity in TOF- and contrast-enhanced MRA is variable due to different acquisition methods. Our purpose was to quantify collateral supply by using flow-weighted signal in TOF-MRA and blood volume-weighted signal in contrast-enhanced MRA to determine each predictive contribution to tissue infarction and reperfusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS Consecutively (2009-2013), 44 stroke patients with acute proximal anterior circulation occlusion met the inclusion criteria with TOF- and contrast-enhanced MRA and penumbral imaging. Collateralized vessels in the ischemic hemisphere were assessed by TOF- and contrast-enhanced MRA using 2 methods: 1) visual 3-point collateral scoring, and 2) collateral signal quantification by an arterial atlas-based collateral index. Collateral measures were tested by receiver operating characteristic curve and logistic regression against 2 imaging end points of tissue-outcome: final infarct volume and percentage of penumbra saved. RESULTS Visual collateral scores on contrast-enhanced MRA but not TOF were significantly higher in patients with good outcome. Visual collateral scoring on contrast-enhanced MRA was the best rater-based discriminator for final infarct volume < 90 mL (area under the curve, 0.81; P < .01) and percentage of penumbra saved >50% (area under the curve, 0.67; P = .04). Atlas-based collateral index of contrast-enhanced MRA was the overall best independent discriminator for final infarct volume of <90 mL (area under the curve, 0.94; P < .01). Atlas-based collateral index combining the signal of TOF- and contrast-enhanced MRA was the overall best discriminator for effective reperfusion (percentage of penumbra saved >50%; area under the curve, 0.89; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Visual scoring of contrast-enhanced but not TOF-MRA is a reliable predictor of infarct outcome in stroke patients with proximal arterial occlusion. By atlas-based collateral assessment, TOF- and contrast-enhanced MRA both contain predictive signal information for penumbral reperfusion. This could improve risk stratification in further studies.","Ernst, M; Forkert, N D; Brehmer, L; Thomalla, G; Siemonsen, S; Fiehler, J; Kemmling, A",AJNR. American journal of neuroradiology,382,30

Multivariable logistic regression determined predictors of CMRs completed with beneficiaries. FINDINGS Of 19,655 participants, most were female (68%) and had Spanish preferred language (43%). The following had a greater likelihood of CMR completion with beneficiaries: age 65-74 years; non-rural residents; mental health prescription. These variables had less likelihood of CMR completion with beneficiaries: rural areas; men; and presence of medication nonadherence.

This study aimed to determine whether the number of exposure calls related to household disinfectants (HD) received between January 30, 2020 to May 18, 2020 varied from the same time period in the previous year. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review of the poison control center database from the Fondazione Universitario Policlinico Agostino Gemelli IRCCS, Rome, Italy, was conducted. Calls from Italian citizens, hospitals, and general practitioners received during the same time period in 2019 and 2020 were compared. RESULTS The center received 1972 exposure calls during the study period. A 5% increase in calls regarding exposure to HDs was noted from 2019 to 2020 (9.8% to 15.2%, p<0.001). The majority of enquiries regarded bleach-containing products, hand sanitizers, ethanol, and hydrogen peroxide. Most calls were received from patients in their homes (n, 259; prevalence, 86%; increase, 107%) and concerned accidental exposure (n, 280; prevalence, 93%; increase, 76%), while cases of intentional exposure decreased (n, 14; prevalence, 5%; decrease, 33%). The main route of exposure was ingestion (n, 170; prevalence, 57%; increase, 45%), but the highest increase was observed in inhalation cases (n, 82; prevalence, 27%; increase, 122%). CONCLUSIONS As the incidence of enquiries regarding products that can represent an important health hazard, when improperly used, increased in 2020 suggests that the COVID-19 public health messaging on the proper use of HDs should be improved.","Soave, P M; Grassi, S; Oliva, A; Romanò, B; Di Stasio, E; Dominici, L; Pascali, V; Antonelli, M",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,382,1

METHODS Nasopharyngeal swabs from 453 adult SARS-CoV-2-infected patients from the Department of Infectious Diseases, Besançon, France, were collected at the time of admission or consultation for RT-PCR analysis. Clinical information and concentrations of biological parameters (CRP, fibrinogen, LDH, prealbumin) were noticed. RESULTS Mean respiratory VL homogeneously decreased from 7.2 log10 copies/ml (95%CI: 6.6 to 7.8) on the first day of symptoms until 4.6 log10 copies/ml (95%CI: 3.8 to 5.4) at day 10 (slope=-0.24; R²=0.95). VL were poorly correlated with COVID-19 symptoms and outcome, excepted for dyspnea and anosmia, which were significantly associated with lower VL (p<0.05). CRP, fibrinogen, and LDH concentrations significantly increased over the first 10 days (median CRP concentrations from 36.8 mg/L at days 0-1 to 99.5 mg/L at days 8-10, p<0.01), whereas prealbumin concentrations tended to decrease. CONCLUSION Since SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viral loads regularly decrease in the acute phase of infection, determining the level of VL may help predicting the onset of virus shedding in a specific patient. However, the role of SARS-CoV-2 VL as a biomarker of severity is limited. This article is protected by copyright.

Yet, we know little about how this enriched language environment influences the connectivity of children's brains. Behavioural research in children and adults has shown that bilingualism experience may boost executive control (EC) skills, such as inhibitory control and attention. Moreover, increased structural and functional (resting-state) connectivity in language-related and EC-related brain networks is associated with increased executive control in bilingual adults. However, how bilingualism factors alter brain connectivity early in brain development remains poorly understood. We will combine standardised tests of attention with structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in bilingual children. This study will allow us to address an important field of inquiry within linguistics and developmental cognitive neuroscience by examining the following questions: Does bilingual experience modulate connectivity in language-related and EC-related networks in children? Do differences in resting-state brain connectivity correlate with differences in EC skills (specifically attention skills)? How do bilingualism-related factors, such as age of exposure to two languages, language usage and proficiency, modulate brain connectivity? We will collect structural and functional MRI, and quantitative measures of EC and language skills from two groups of English-Greek bilingual children - 20 simultaneous bilinguals (exposure to both languages from birth) and 20 successive bilinguals (exposure to English between the ages of 3 and 5 years) - and 20 English monolingual children, 8-10 years old. We will compare connectivity measures and attention skills between monolinguals and bilinguals to examine the effects of bilingual exposure.

Still, the evidence for people with dementia in home care is unclear because a lot of studies are performed in a laboratory or institutional setting, and mainly use robots in prototype stages. OBJECTIVE This study aims to explore the effects of the refined, commercially-available, humanoid SAR Pepper combined with a tablet PC-based dementia training program (Coach Pepper) versus an exclusively tablet PC-based dementia training program on psychosocial and physical outcomes of people with dementia living at home, including caregivers and dementia trainers. We hypothesize that Coach Pepper has a more positive effect on the primary outcome motivation (stable or decreased apathy) of people with dementia. METHODS A mixed methods study will be performed, including a randomized controlled, parallel, 2-arm study with a complementary qualitative part. This sample includes 40 PWD living at home and 40 relatives, each complemented with five professional caregivers and dementia trainers. The intervention group will receive Coach Pepper (a SAR connected with a tablet PC-based dementia training program), and the control group will receive exclusively tablet PC-based training without the SAR. The duration of the intervention will be three weeks per household. Data will be collected at baseline and during and after the intervention by standardized questionnaires, sensor data of the robot, and tablet PC, as well as semistructured interviews, focus groups, and observation. RESULTS To date, no results are available for this study protocol. The study intervention started in May 2019 and will end in Spring 2020. CONCLUSIONS The intervention of this study can be seen as a nonpharmacological intervention, including cognitive and physical training by a robot. This study will help to further refine SAR for the specific needs of people with dementia living at home.

Concomitant venous thromboembolism (VTE), a potential cause of unexplained deaths, has frequently been reported in COVID-19 cases, but its management is still challenging due to the complexity between antithrombotic therapy and hematological alterations. In the era of COVID-19 pandemic is strongly recommended for patients who require chronic anticoagulation to continue therapy to prevent thromboembolic events. To avoid regular and frequent blood tests and unnecessary exposure to SARS-CoV-2 during contacts with medical personnel DOACs should be strongly preferred whenever possible. Current evidence is insufficient to recommend routine pharmacological antithrombotic prophylaxis in all hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In COVID-19 patients suspected for VTE or in whom the diagnosis is confirmed parenteral therapy with LMWH should be initiated in the absence of contraindications.

METHODS This Type 1 hybrid implementation-effectiveness study involves a pre-post design (implementation study) followed by a randomized trial of PSS (effectiveness study). Participants are at least 114 justice and service staff from 7 sites in three states: probation officers, community treatment providers, a supervisor from each agency, and key stakeholders. The study will recruit up to 680 individuals on probation from seven adult community probation offices; eligible individuals will be recently committed, English speakers, with opioid use disorder (OUD). Core Implementation Study: The study will use the exploration, preparation, implementation, sustainability (EPIS) framework to guide system-change through facilitated LCTs of probation and community treatment staff given a core set of implementation strategies to set goals. The study will collect program-level and staff survey data at the end of each EPIS stage. Implementation outcomes: Organizational engagement in MOUD (primary), plus changes in staff knowledge/attitudes and organizational outcomes (secondary). Effectiveness Study of PSS: After completing implementation, the study will randomize adults on probation to receive PSS vs. treatment as usual, with assessments at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. Effectiveness outcomes include participant engagement in MOUD (primary), probation revocation, illicit opioid use, and overdoses. Other aims include identifying barriers and facilitators, and cost-benefit analysis of PSS.

Therefore, their metabolic properties and the effects on activity of cytochrome P450 (P450, CYP) enzymes and drug transporters should be considered into when developing the most efficient treatments for patients. METHODS Scientific literature on the interactions of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, with human P450 enzymes and drug transporters was searched using PUBMED.Gov (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and the ADME database (https://life-science.kyushu.fujitsu.com/admedb/). RESULTS Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are metabolized by P450 1A2, 2C8, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4/5 in vitro and by P450s 2C8 and 3A4/5 in vivo by N-deethylation. Chloroquine effectively inhibited P450 2D6 in vitro; however, in vivo inhibition was not apparent except in individuals with limited P450 2D6 activity. Chloroquine is both an inhibitor and inducer of the transporter MRP1 and is also a substrate of the Mate and MRP1 transport systems. Hydroxychloroquine also inhibited P450 2D6 and the transporter OATP1A2. CONCLUSIONS Chloroquine caused a statistically significant decrease of P450 2D6 activity in vitro and in vivo, inhibiting also its own metabolism by the enzyme. The inhibition indicates a potential for clinical drug-drug interactions when taken with other drugs that are predominant substrates of the P450 2D6. When chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are used clinically with other drugs, substrates of P450 2D6 enzyme, attention should be given to substrate specific metabolism by P450 2D6 alleles present in individuals taking the drugs.","Rendic, Slobodan P; Guengerich, F Peter",Current drug metabolism,382,17

Right heart failure (RHF) has been mostly addressed in the context of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), where it is not possible to discern pulmonary vascular- and RV-directed effects of therapeutic approaches. In part, opposing pathomechanisms in RV and pulmonary vasculature, i.e., regarding apoptosis, angiogenesis and proliferation, complicate addressing RHF in PAH. Therapy effective for left heart failure is not applicable to RHF, e.g., inhibition of adrenoceptor signaling and of the renin-angiotensin system had no or only limited success. A number of experimental studies employing animal models for PAH or RV dysfunction or failure have identified beneficial effects of novel pharmacological agents, with most promising results obtained with modulators of metabolism and reactive oxygen species or inflammation, respectively. In addition, established PAH agents, in particular phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors and soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators, may directly address RV integrity. Promising results are furthermore derived with microRNA (miRNA) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) blocking or mimetic strategies, which can target microvascular rarefaction, inflammation, metabolism or fibrotic and hypertrophic remodeling in the dysfunctional RV. Likewise, pre-clinical data demonstrate that cell-based therapies using stem or progenitor cells have beneficial effects on the RV, mainly by improving the microvascular system, however clinical success will largely depend on delivery routes. A particular option for PAH is targeted denervation of the pulmonary vasculature, given the sympathetic overdrive in PAH patients. Finally, acute and durable mechanical circulatory support are available for the right heart, which however has been tested mostly in RHF with concomitant left heart disease. Here, we aim to review current pharmacological, RNA- and cell-based therapeutic options and their potential to directly target the RV and to review available data for pulmonary artery denervation and mechanical circulatory support.","Klinke, Anna; Schubert, Torben; Müller, Marion; Legchenko, Ekaterina; Zelt, Jason G E; Shimauchi, Tsukasa; Napp, L Christian; Rothman, Alexander M K; Bonnet, Sébastien; Stewart, Duncan J; Hansmann, Georg; Rudolph, Volker",Cardiovascular diagnosis and therapy,382,2

Even though little attention has been paid to esophageal disorders in the context of DM, its prevalence is higher compared to gastroparesis. Heartburn, as a typical symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), is the most prevalent symptom and has been found in 25 to 41% of patients with DM. Furthermore, DM has recently been established as possible independent factor for the development of Barrett's esophagus. The pathophysiology of esophageal disorders in patients with DM is complex and multifactorial, and the mechanisms described include the following: hyperglycemia, autonomic neuropathy, biomechanical and sensory alterations of the esophagus, presbyesophagus, and psychiatric comorbidity. Opportune detection, together with adequate glycemic control, can delay the onset of esophageal dysfunction and slow its progression in diabetic patients. There is limited evidence on patients with DM and esophageal dysfunction, with respect to medical treatment. Lifestyle modifications, prokinetics, and proton pump inhibitors should be indicated on an individual basis in patients that present with DM and esophageal disorders.

Despite recent advances in telecommunication technologies, the field of orthopedics has been slow to adopt these resources in offsetting barriers to care. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced departments to change their clinical approach, lending unprecedented opportunity to better understand how telehealth may bridge this care gap in foot and ankle practices. The purpose of this study was to assess patient-reported outcomes of telemedicine encounters, including comfort and patient satisfaction. Our hypothesis was that patients would be significantly less satisfied with telemedicine when compared with in-office appointments for all nonemergency visit types. METHODS Telemedicine satisfaction was assessed via phone survey with a modified 1 to 5 Likert scale. Patients who had completed a telemedicine visit between April 13, 2020, and June 19, 2020, were eligible to participate. Patient demographics were recorded, and data were analyzed using paired and independent t tests for parametric continuous data and Fisher's exact and chi-square tests for noncontinuous data. A total of 216 patients completed the telemedicine questionnaire. RESULTS The overall mean satisfaction for telemedicine visits (4.7) was significantly lower than that for in-office visits (4.9) (P < .001). However, the majority (90.3%) of patients reported they would use telemedicine again in the future. When compared, patients seeking fracture care had significantly higher telemedicine satisfaction (4.9, n = 38) than those receiving nonfracture care (4.6, n = 178) (P = .001), and those greater than 50 miles from the clinic had higher satisfaction (5.0, n = 14) than patients living within 50 miles of the clinic (4.7, n = 202) (P < .001). CONCLUSION Patients were more satisfied with their in-office clinic visit than telemedicine, although the vast majority of patients endorsed a willingness to utilize telemedicine in the future. Patients with trauma and greater barriers to foot and ankle care were more satisfied with their telemedicine visits.

Plain films are considered the first line imaging technique due to its ability to depict femoral head morphological changes, to its low costs and high availability. CT is not a routinely performed technique, but is useful to rule out the presence of a subchondral fracture when MRI is doubtful or contraindicated. MRI is unanimously considered the gold standard technique in the early stages, being capable to detect bone marrow changes such as edema and sclerosis. It may be useful also to guide treatment and, as CT, it is a validated technique in follow-up of patients with FHAVN. Nuclear medicine imaging is mostly applied in post-operative period to detect graft viability or infective complications. More advanced techniques may be useful in particular conditions but still need to be validated; thus new research trials are desirable. In conclusion, X-ray examination is the first line approach, but lacks of sensitivity in early stage whereas MRI is indicated. CT easily depicts late stage deformation and may decrease MRI false positive results in detecting the subchondral fracture. However, the role of both Nuclear Medicine Imaging and advanced MR techniques in FHAVN still need to be investigated.","Manenti, Guglielmo; Altobelli, Simone; Pugliese, Luca; Tarantino, Umberto","Clinical cases in mineral and bone metabolism : the official journal of the Italian Society of Osteoporosis, Mineral Metabolism, and Skeletal Diseases",382,17

One strategy to bridge the gap is the World Health Organization's Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP), which provides evidence-based guidance for managing mental, neurological, and substance abuse conditions. mhGAP has been implemented in more than 90 countries, but there has been limited training within many Pacific Island countries. We describe implementation of mhGAP training in Kosrae, a state within the Federated States of Micronesia. mhGAP training was conducted with 18 members of the Kosrae Community Health Center (KCHC). Our training model included 2 helpful modifications: (1) participants attended a combination of online sessions and a 1-week in-person training, which allowed for more time and flexibility in delivering training; and (2) longitudinal support posttraining, which has been identified as an important factor in successful implementation of mhGAP.","Engelhard, Caitlin; Haack, Sara; Alik, Tholman",Asia-Pacific journal of public health,382,6

The results showed that P. galeiformis reduced the disease incidence and lesion diameters without direct contact with the pathogen Penicillium digitatum. Transcriptome analysis revealed that phenylpropanoid biosynthesis was triggered by P. galeiformis. Genes encoding phenylpropanoid biosynthesis were upregulated, including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), 4-coumaroyl-CoA ligase (4CL), cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H), peroxidase (POD), cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), O-methyltransferase, and hydroxyl cinnamoyl transferase. Moreover, P. galeiformis increased the activity of PAL, 4CL, C4H, POD, polyphenol oxidase, and CAD in citrus pericarp. In addition, P. galeiformis treated citrus displayed higher levels of total phenolic compounds, flavonoid, and lignin and higher amounts of ferulic and sinapic acid. In conclusion, these results suggested that P. galeiformis could induce resistance through modulating the pathway of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis in postharvest citrus.","Chen, Ou; Deng, Lili; Ruan, Changqing; Yi, Lanhua; Zeng, Kaifang",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,382,1

Data on long-term outcome would be helpful in defining the role of sleeve gastrectomy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of sleeve gastrectomy as a primary bariatric procedure. METHODS Medical charts of all patients who underwent a primary sleeve gastrectomy at the authors' institution between August 2006 and December 2012 were reviewed retrospectively using a prospective online data registry. For evolution of weight loss and co-morbidity, only patients with follow-up of at least 1 year were included. A subgroup analysis was done to compare patients with an intended stand-alone procedure and those with an intended two-stage procedure. RESULTS A total of 1041 primary sleeve gastrectomies were performed in the study period. Median duration of surgery was 47 min, and median hospital stay was 2 days. Intra-abdominal bleeding occurred in 27 patients (2·6 per cent) and staple-line leakage in 24 (2.3 per cent). Some 866 patients had at least 1 year of follow-up. Mean excess weight loss was 68.4 per cent after 1 year (P < 0.001) and 67.4 per cent after 2 years. Smaller groups of patients achieved a mean excess weight loss of 69.3 per cent (163 patients), 70.5 per cent (62) and 58.3 per cent (19) after 3, 4 and 5 years respectively. No difference in postoperative complications was found between the subgroups. Seventy-one (8.2 per cent) of 866 patients had a revision of the sleeve gastrectomy; reflux or dysphagia was the indication in 34 (48 per cent) of these patients. CONCLUSION Sleeve gastrectomy is a safe and effective bariatric procedure. Maximum weight loss was achieved after 4 years. Long-term results regarding weight loss and co-morbidities were satisfactory.","van Rutte, P W J; Smulders, J F; de Zoete, J P; Nienhuijs, S W",The British journal of surgery,382,31

DESIGN A case series of n = 15 patients with lower-extremity chronic wounds were treated with an antibacterial foam dressing consisting of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) foam bound with gentian violet and methylene blue (Hydrofera Blue; Hydrofera, LLC, Willimantic, Connecticut). SETTING An outpatient clinic in Ontario, Canada. PATIENTS The dressing was applied to diabetic foot ulcers (n = 8) and other venous/leg wound etiologies (n = 7). The study population was clinically challenging due to high mean body weight, extended wound durations, and high diabetes prevalence. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Wounds were assessed for clinical signs of superficial and deep/surrounding bacterial burden using the validated NERDS and STONEES mnemonic and with semiquantitative bacterial swabs. Changes in wound size, pain, and other clinical parameters were also recorded. MAIN RESULTS Improvements in surface critical colonization and pain score at the end of the study period were noted in some patients, especially in patients with diabetic foot ulcers. A decreasing wound size was observed in 8 of the 14 patients (57%) at week 4. One patient was excluded from wound size change analysis. CONCLUSIONS An antibacterial foam dressing consisting of PVA foam bound with gentian violet and methylene blue showed encouraging results in a clinically challenging study population. This dressing may be a suitable option for lower-extremity chronic wounds demonstrating an increased superficial bacterial burden. Further investigation focused on identifying the characteristics of patients who are most responsive to the dressing is warranted.","Coutts, Patricia M; Ryan, Judy; Sibbald, R Gary",Advances in skin & wound care,382,20

We assessed whether markers of endothelial damage and immune dysregulation were associated with organ failure, thrombus formation, and death. Approach and Results: Markers of endothelial damage (VWF:Ag [von Willebrand factor antigen], PAI-1 [plasminogen activator inhibitor-1], syndecan-1, TFPI [tissue factor pathway inhibitor], and soluble thrombomodulin), complement activation (C5a and C5b-9), cytokines (IL [interleukin]-6, TNF [tumor necrosis factor]-α, and IL-2R), and neutrophil extracellular traps (cell-free DNA, nucleosomes, and myeloperoxidase-DNA) were measured at intensive care unit admission in 82 patients with COVID-19. We also analyzed the histological composition of thrombi collected in critically ill living patients successfully weaned from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Beside respiratory failure, VWF:Ag, PAI-1, TFPI, and syndecan-1 were independently associated with liver injury and multiorgan failure development, underlining the direct role of endotheliopathy in organ failure. Nucleosomes were also associated with liver injury, multiorgan failure, and death which occurred in 38%, 60%, and 27% of patients, respectively. Moreover, dysregulated immune response including cytokines, complement, and neutrophil extracellular traps was associated with markers of endothelial damage, respiratory failure, and liver injury. COVID-19 thrombi retrieved from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuitry contained accumulation of neutrophils, VWF, and significantly higher amount of neutrophil extracellular traps when compared with non-COVID-19 thrombi. CONCLUSIONS We provide new associative data supporting that endotheliopathy and dysregulated immune responses are involved in respiratory and liver failure through microvascular damage in patients with severe COVID-19.","Dupont, Annabelle; Rauch, Antoine; Staessens, Senna; Moussa, Mouhamed; Rosa, Mickael; Corseaux, Delphine; Jeanpierre, Emmanuelle; Goutay, Julien; Caplan, Morgan; Varlet, Pauline; Lefevre, Guillaume; Lassalle, Fanny; Bauters, Anne; Faure, Karine; Lambert, Marc; Duhamel, Alain; Labreuche, Julien; Garrigue, Delphine; De Meyer, Simon F; Staels, Bart; Vincent, Flavien; Rousse, Natacha; Kipnis, Eric; Lenting, Peter; Poissy, Julien; Susen, Sophie","Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",382,1

OBJECTIVE To identify the safety and efficacy of SVAT in a large multicenter patient cohort and evaluate prognostic markers of clinical outcome following SVAT. METHODS This study retrospectively enrolled 50 consecutive patients undergoing SVAT at 11 different centers. We analyzed Hunt and Hess and Fisher grades, aneurysm location, angiographic vasospasm grade, Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at discharge, and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. RESULTS A total of 50 patients undergoing SVAT between the years 2003 and 2009 were identified. Patients presented, on average, 6.48±4.45 days after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Hunt and Hess and Fisher grades were 1 (n=7), 2 (n=12), 3 (n=14), 4 (n=15), 5 (n=2), and 3 and 4 (n=33), respectively. Aneurysm location was distributed as follows: anterior (n=32), posterior (n=16), anterior and posterior (n=2). Patients with good clinical condition (Hunt and Hess score 1-3) had significantly higher odds of surviving (OR=17.5, 95% CI 1.9 to 161.5), favorable GOS (OR=4.2, 95% CI 1.2 to 14.8), and favorable 90-day mRS (OR=4.2, 95% CI 1.2 to 14.8).

The STRATIS registry (Systematic Evaluation of Patients Treated With Neurothrombectomy Devices for Acute Ischemic Stroke) aimed to assess whether similar process timelines, technical, and functional outcomes could be achieved in a large real world cohort as in the randomized trials. METHODS STRATIS was designed to prospectively enroll patients treated in the United States with a Solitaire Revascularization Device and Mindframe Capture Low Profile Revascularization Device within 8 hours from symptom onset. The STRATIS cohort was compared with the interventional cohort of a previously published SEER patient-level meta-analysis. RESULTS A total of 984 patients treated at 55 sites were analyzed. The mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 17.3. Intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator was administered in 64.0%. The median time from onset to arrival in the enrolling hospital, door to puncture, and puncture to reperfusion were 138, 72, and 36 minutes, respectively. The Core lab-adjudicated modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction ≥2b was achieved in 87.9% of patients. At 90 days, 56.5% achieved a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2, all-cause mortality was 14.4%, and 1.4% suffered a symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. The median time from emergency medical services scene arrival to puncture was 152 minutes, and each hour delay in this interval was associated with a 5.5% absolute decline in the likelihood of achieving modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 2.

We aimed to test our hypothesis that exposure to intimate partner violence would reduce intervention effectiveness for CMDs in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). METHODS For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, CINAHL, LILACS, ScieELO, Cochrane, PubMed databases, trials registries, 3ie, Google Scholar, and forward and backward citations for studies published between database inception and Aug 16, 2019. All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of psychological interventions for CMDs in LMICs which measured intimate partner violence were included, without language or date restrictions. We approached study authors to obtain unpublished aggregate subgroup data for women who did and did not report intimate partner violence. We did separate random-effects meta-analyses for anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and psychological distress outcomes. Evidence from randomised controlled trials was synthesised as differences between standardised mean differences (SMDs) for change in symptoms, comparing women who did and who did not report intimate partner violence via random-effects meta-analyses. The quality of the evidence was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. This study is registered on PROSPERO, number CRD42017078611. FINDINGS Of 8122 records identified, 21 were eligible and data were available for 15 RCTs, all of which had a low to moderate risk of overall bias. Anxiety (five interventions, 728 participants) showed a greater response to intervention among women reporting intimate partner violence than among those who did not (difference in standardised mean differences [dSMD] 0·31, 95% CI 0·04 to 0·57, I2=49·4%). No differences in response to intervention were seen in women reporting intimate partner violence for PTSD (eight interventions, n=1436; dSMD 0·14, 95% CI -0·06 to 0·33, I2=42·6%), depression (12 interventions, n=2940; 0·10, -0·04 to 0·25, I2=49·3%), and psychological distress (four interventions, n=1591; 0·07, -0·05 to 0·18, I2=0·0%, p=0·681). INTERPRETATION Psychological interventions treat anxiety effectively in women with current or recent intimate partner violence exposure in LMICs when delivered by appropriately trained and supervised health-care staff, even when not tailored for this population or targeting intimate partner violence directly. Future research should investigate whether adapting evidence-based psychological interventions for CMDs to address intimate partner violence enhances their acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness in LMICs.

In the present paper we discuss four pillars to face a pandemic: surgical and outpatients service, tele-medicine and tele-education. In the face of unprecedented risks in providing adequate health care to our patients during this current, evolving public health crisis of COVID-19, alternative patient management tools such as telemedicine services, allow clinicians to maintain necessary patient rapport with their healthcare provider when required. As a subspecialty, urology should take full advantage of telehealth and tele-education at this juncture. As tele-urology and tele-education can obviate the potential drawbacks of ""social distancing"" as it pertains to healthcare, the platform can also reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread, without compromising quality urological care and educational efforts.

Cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers are usually employed to assess risk or damage, or during follow-up. Proteinuria is considered a strong predictor of morbidity, a cause of inflammation, oxidative stress, hemodynamic alteration, and progression of chronic kidney disease. However, proteinuria is rarely considered in the clinical assessment of HD patients. METHODS This was a concurrent, cohort-observational, cross-sectional study in which 52 chronic HD subjects were divided into three groups according to the degree of proteinuria: Group (G) A: <1 g/day, n = 25; GB: 1-3 g/day, n = 13; GC: >3 g/day, n = 14. Baseline hemoglobin, albuminemia, cholesterol, body mass index, Malnutrition-Inflammatory Score, pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, troponin T, C-reactive protein (CRP), and ultrafiltration rates were analyzed. RESULTS There was no difference between groups in terms of baseline age, gender, hypertension, cause of renal failure, hemoglobin, cholesterol, albumin, CRP levels, cardiac biomarkers, adiponectin, body mass index, or Malnutrition-Inflammatory Score. Time on HD: GA, 34.56 ± 23.3 (range [r]: 6-88); GB, 25.15 ± 19.40 (r: 6-58); GC, 18.21 ± 9.58 (r: 6-74) months; P = 0.048. Proteinuria: GA, 0.33 ± 0.30 (r: 0.0-0.88); GB, 1.66 ± 0.54 (r: 1.03-2.75); GC, 7.18 ± 2.80 (r: 3.04-21.5) g/day; P < 0.001. Mean ultrafiltration rates were significantly different: GA, 2.80 ± 0.73; GB: 1.85 ± 0.96 liters/session; P = 0.003. Fourteen diabetic patients were identified (27%): GA, 3 (12%); GB, 3 (23%); GC, 8 (57%); P = 0.009. A positive and significant correlation was observed between diabetes and proteinuria >3 g/day: rho 0.438, P = 0.027. Although troponin T, pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, adiponectin, and CRP were not different among groups, the positive correlation between troponin T and CRP elevated significantly as proteinuria increased: GA, rho 377, P = 0.063; GB, rho 663, P = 0.013; GC, rho 687, P = 0.007. CONCLUSION In chronic HD, nephrotic-range proteinuria was significantly higher in diabetic nephropathy patients versus other causes. This was associated with inflammation and cardiac stress and was independent of fluid removal. Proteinuria >3 g/day was associated with shorter time on HD. Whether severe proteinuria is associated with shorter survival in HD, independent of diabetes, is to be determined. Proteinuria should be considered in the assessment of cardiovascular and inflammatory states in HD patients.","Trimarchi, Hernán; Muryan, Alexis; Dicugno, Mariana; Young, Pablo; Forrester, Mariano; Lombi, Fernando; Pomeranz, Vanesa; Iriarte, Romina; Raña, María Soledad; Alonso, Mirta",International journal of nephrology and renovascular disease,382,30

METHODS Five eligible patients with node-negative rectal cancer located 4-12 cm from the anal verge were enrolled in an IRB-approved pilot study. All patients underwent transanal endoscopic TME with laparoscopic assistance, hand-sewn coloanal anastomosis, and a diverting loop ileostomy. Primary and secondary end points included adequacy of the mesorectal excision and 30-day postoperative complications, respectively. RESULTS Between November 2011 and May 2012, three males and two females underwent transanal endoscopic TME with laparoscopic assistance. Patient mean age and BMI were 48.6 ± 9.8 years and 25.7 ± 2.3 kg/m(2), respectively. Tumors were located an average of 5.7 ± 2.4 cm from the anal verge and preoperatively staged as T1N0M0 (2), T2N0M0 (1), and T3N0M0 (2). Mean operative time was 274.6 ± 85.4 min with no intraoperative complications. Partial intersphincteric resection was performed in conjunction with transanal endoscopic TME in three patients. Pathologic examination of TME specimens demonstrated complete mesorectal excision in all cases with negative proximal, distal, and radial margins. Mean length of hospital stay was 5.2 ± 2.6 days and three minor complications occurred, including one ileus and two cases of transient urinary dysfunction. At a mean early follow-up of 5.4 ± 2.3 months, all patients remain disease-free. CONCLUSIONS In this pilot study of five patients with rectal cancer, transanal endoscopic TME with laparoscopic assistance is feasible and safe, and is a promising alternative to open and laparoscopic TME. Evaluation of long-term functional and oncologic outcomes of this approach is needed before widespread adoption can be recommended.","Sylla, Patricia; Bordeianou, Liliana G; Berger, David; Han, Kyung S; Lauwers, Gregory Y; Sahani, Dushyant V; Sbeih, Mohammed A; Lacy, Antonio M; Rattner, David W",Surgical endoscopy,382,1

Efforts in this area have, however, been fraught with challenges. The handful of existing broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies has provided information on some of the virus' sites of vulnerability, fueling a decade of structure-informed vaccine design. The fact that very few bnmAbs have been recovered to date illustrates the poor immunogenicity of these epitopes. Recognizing that progress may require more basic information, there has been a notable shift in the field toward identifying new chinks in HIV-1's armor. These efforts are based on the observation that some infected patients develop exceptionally broad serum neutralizing antibodies responses, a better understanding of which would be valuable for vaccine efforts aimed at eliciting similar specificities. RECENT FINDINGS New mapping methodologies are now providing an appreciation of the incidence of specificities similar to the existing known bnmAbs as well as some intriguing insights into novel specificities. SUMMARY The new information emerging from mapping efforts should help to sharpen efforts to isolate new bnmAbs and moreover, may provide crucial information for the rational design of novel vaccine candidates.","Binley, James",Current opinion in HIV and AIDS,382,33

Genotype analysis of the 724 wild-type rotavirus samples from both children and adults demonstrated that G3P[8] was the dominant genotype nationally, identified in 46.7% of samples, followed by G2P[4] in 8.8% of samples. The Australian National Immunisation Program (NIP) changed to the exclusive use of Rotarix as of 1 July 2017. The NIP had previously included two live-attenuated oral vaccines: Rotarix (monovalent, human) and RotaTeq (pentavalent, human-bovine reassortant) in a state-based vaccine selection. Continuous surveillance is imperative to determine the effect of this change in rotavirus vaccine schedule on the genotype distribution and diversity in Australia.","Thomas, Sarah; Donato, Celeste M; Roczo-Farkas, Susie; Hua, Jenny; Bines, Julie E",Communicable diseases intelligence,382,1

Operative repair of Achilles tendon ruptures leads to reduced tendon elongation. Tendon lengthening is a key problem in the restoration of function following Achilles tendon rupture. A study was performed to determine differences in initial separation, strength and failure characteristics of differing sutures and numbers of core strands in a percutaneous Achilles tendon repair model in response to initial loading. METHODS Nineteen bovine Achilles tendons were repaired using a percutaneous/minimally invasive technique with a combination of a modified Bunnell suture proximally and a Kessler suture distally, using non-absorbable 4-strand 6-strand repairs and absorbable 8-strand sutures. Specimens were then cyclically loaded using phases of 10 cycles of 100 N, 100 cycles of 100 N, 100 cycles of 190 N consistent with early range of motion training and weight-bearing, before being loaded to failure. RESULTS Pre-conditioning of 10 cycles of 100 N resulted in separations of 4 mm for 6-strand, 5.9 mm for 4-strand, but 11.5 mm in 8-strand repairs, this comprised 48.5, 68.6 and 72.7% of the separation that occurred after 100 cycles of 100 N. The tendon separation after the third phase of 100 cycles of 190 N was 17.4 mm for 4-strand repairs, 16.6 mm for 6-strand repairs and 26.6 mm for 8-strand repairs. There were significant differences between the groups (p < 0.0001). Four and six strand non-absorbable repairs had significantly less separation than 8-strand absorbable repairs (p = 0.017 and p = 0.04 respectively). The mean (SEM) ultimate tensile strengths were 4-strand 464.8 N (27.4), 6-strand 543.5 N (49.6) and 8-strand 422.1 N (80.5). Regression analysis reveals no significant difference between the overall strength of the 3 repair models (p = 0.32) (4 vs. 6: p = 0.30, 4 vs. 8: p = 0.87; 6 vs. 8: p = 0.39). The most common mode of failure was pull out of the Kessler suture from the distal stump in 41.7% of specimens. CONCLUSION The use of a non-absorbable suture resulted in less end-to-end separation when compared to absorbable sutures when an Achilles tendon repair model was subject to cyclical loading. Ultimate failure occurred more commonly at the distal Kessler suture end although this occurred with separations in excess of clinical failure. The effect of early movement and loading on the Achilles tendon is not fully understood and requires more research.","Carmont, Michael R; Kuiper, Jan Herman; Grävare Silbernagel, Karin; Karlsson, Jón; Nilsson-Helander, Katarina",Journal of experimental orthopaedics,382,11

It is highly infectious, with quick spreading and a wide range of impact. It has been broken out in many countries around the world and has become a public health emergency of international concern. Chinese medicine has a long history in treating plague, and viral disease is the clinical advantage in Chinese medicine. Under the premise that there is currently no specific drug treatment, Chinese medicine has achieved certain effects in the treatment of COVID-19, which has attracted much attention and has been upgraded to a national strategy. Regarding the treatment of COVID-19 with Chinese medicine, it is believed that in terms of the name of Chinese medicine, the modern connotation of ""uniform of typhoid and febrile disease"" should be re-recognized, and it is advisable to use drugs based on specific clinical prescriptions and indications. In terms of pathogenesis, the COVID-19 has the pathogenesis rules including from the mild to severe conditions, from the surface to the inside, from the excess syndrome to the deficiency syndrome. We should pay attention to the Taiyang syndrome damaged by wet disease in initial stage, Shaoyang syndrome complicated with Yangming syndrome in the middle stage, phlegm-heat obstructing lung in critical period, lung and spleen deficiency in the recovery stage. In terms of clinical treatment strategies, Dayuan Yin is recommended to induce sweat and disperse the stasis in early stage. Xiaochaihu Decoction and Maxing Shigan Decoction is used to relieve both exterior and interior symptoms in middle stage. In critical stage, Tingli Dazao Xiefei Decoction, Weijing Decoction, Xuanbai Chengqi Decoction, Xiaoxianxiong Decoction, and Sanzi Yangqin Decoction are considered to reduce phlegm and clear heat. We should pay attention to nourishing Qi and strengthening the spleen by Zhuye Shigao Decoction, Sha-shen Maidong Decoction, and Liujunzi Decoction in the later recovery period. It shall be noted that, no matter in the initial mild stage, the middle and critical stages, or in the later recovery stage, Chinese medicine plays an important role, including preventing mild to severe disease, shortening the fever time, improving cough symptoms, increasing blood oxygen saturation and reducing mortality. Many studies have shown that the classical herbal formulae can alleviate the cytokine storm, regulate the immune imbalance, and produce the potential effect of synergistic treatment for COVID-19 through multiple components, multiple targets, and multiple pathways.","Su, Ke-Lei; Xiong, Xing-Jiang",Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica,382,1

Another mechanism of protein birth is provided by overlapping genes. They are created de novo by mutations within a coding sequence that lead to the expression of a novel protein in another reading frame, a process called ""overprinting."" To investigate this mechanism, we have analyzed the sequences of the protein products of manually curated overlapping genes from 43 genera of unspliced RNA viruses infecting eukaryotes. Overlapping proteins have a sequence composition globally biased toward disorder-promoting amino acids and are predicted to contain significantly more structural disorder than nonoverlapping proteins. By analyzing the phylogenetic distribution of overlapping proteins, we were able to confirm that 17 of these had been created de novo and to study them individually. Most proteins created de novo are orphans (i.e., restricted to one species or genus). Almost all are accessory proteins that play a role in viral pathogenicity or spread, rather than proteins central to viral replication or structure. Most proteins created de novo are predicted to be fully disordered and have a highly unusual sequence composition. This suggests that some viral overlapping reading frames encoding hypothetical proteins with highly biased composition, often discarded as noncoding, might in fact encode proteins. Some proteins created de novo are predicted to be ordered, however, and whenever a three-dimensional structure of such a protein has been solved, it corresponds to a fold previously unobserved, suggesting that the study of these proteins could enhance our knowledge of protein space.","Rancurel, Corinne; Khosravi, Mahvash; Dunker, A Keith; Romero, Pedro R; Karlin, David",Journal of virology,382,26

In this study, we report the induction of AP-1 transcription factors by coronavirus infection based on genome-wide analyses of differentially expressed genes in cells infected with avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Most members of the AP-1 transcription factors were subsequently found to be upregulated during the course of IBV and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection of cultured cells as well as in IBV-infected chicken embryos. Further characterization of the induction kinetics and functional roles of cFOS in IBV replication demonstrated that upregulation of cFOS at early to intermediate phases of IBV replication cycles suppresses IBV-induced apoptosis and promotes viral replication. Blockage of nuclear translocation of cFOS by peptide inhibitor NLSP suppressed IBV replication and apoptosis, ruling out the involvement of the cytoplasmic functions of cFOS in the replication of IBV. Furthermore, knockdown of ERK1/2 and inhibition of JNK and p38 kinase activities reduced cFOS upregulation and IBV replication. This study reveals an important function of cFOS in the regulation of coronavirus-induced apoptosis, facilitating viral replication.IMPORTANCE The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a newly emerged zoonotic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), highlights the importance of coronaviruses as human and animal pathogens and our knowledge gaps in understanding the cellular mechanisms, especially mechanisms shared among human and animal coronaviruses, exploited by coronaviruses for optimal replication and enhanced pathogenicity. This study reveals that upregulation of cFOS, along with other AP-1 transcription factors, as a cell-survival strategy is such a mechanism utilized by coronaviruses during their replication cycles. Through induction and regulation of apoptosis of the infected cells at early to intermediate phases of the replication cycles, subtle but appreciable differences in coronavirus replication efficiency were observed when the expression levels of cFOS were manipulated in the infected cells. As the AP-1 transcription factors are multi-functional, further studies of their regulatory roles in proinflammatory responses may provide new insights into the pathogenesis and virus-host interactions during coronavirus infection.","Yuan, Li Xia; Liang, Jia Qi; Zhu, Qing Chun; Dai, Guo; Li, Shumin; Fung, To Sing; Liu, Ding Xiang",Journal of virology,382,17

Good correlation between radiologic and pathologic findings in early lung adenocarcinomas has been reported. We aimed to confirm limited resection efficacy as radical surgery in patients with high-resolution computed tomography-indicated minimally invasive lung cancer. The purpose of this interim analysis is to report the details of the patient and nodule characteristics, intraoperative cytology capability as a negative margin indicator, and patient outcome with the median follow-up period of 7 years and 4 months. METHODS Enrollment required patients with a tumor ≤2 cm, diagnosed or suspected as a cT1N0M0 carcinoma in the lung periphery and depicted on high-resolution computed tomography as a sub-solid nodule with tumor disappearance ratio ≥0.5. We performed a wedge or segmental resection as appropriate. The primary endpoint is 10 year local recurrence-free survival rate. RESULTS This study started in November 2003, and 101 patients were enrolled as of November 2009. Of them, 95 were eligible for analysis. There were 38 men and 57 women, aged 30-75, averaging 62 years. Tumor sizes ranged from 7 to 20 mm on computed tomography, averaging 15 mm. There were 11 Noguchi type A tumors, 54 type B tumors, 24 type C tumors, one malignant lymphoma and 5 non-cancerous lesions. All cancers showed no vessel invasion. With a median follow-up period of 88 months, there have been no recurrences. CONCLUSION So far, high-resolution computed tomography appears to predict non- or minimally invasive ground-glass opacity lung cancers with high reliability, warranting limited resection as curative surgery in this cohort.","Yoshida, Junji; Ishii, Genichiro; Hishida, Tomoyuki; Aokage, Keiju; Tsuboi, Masahiro; Ito, Hiroyuki; Yokose, Tomoyuki; Nakayama, Haruhiko; Yamada, Kouzo; Nagai, Kanji",Japanese journal of clinical oncology,382,7

METHODS This retrospective analysis of eight patients with sternal tumors treated in the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from January 2008 to June 2012 included five men and three women aged 37-66 years (mean, 50.4 years). The histological diagnoses were chondrosarcoma (two cases), osteosarcoma (one), malignant fibrous histiocytoma (two), eosinophilic granuloma (one) and sternal metastasis from breast cancer (two). The tumors were invading the manubrium sterni (three cases), manubrium sterni and body (three) and sternal body (two). All patients underwent needle or incisional biopsy prior to sternal tumor resection and titanium mesh thoracic reconstruction. RESULTS All patients were followed for 9 months to 4 years. There were no intraoperative complications or operative or postoperative deaths. One patient developed a deep wound hematoma 1 week postoperatively; incisional drainage and debridement resulting in healing within 2 weeks. There was no loosening or exsertion of the titanium mesh and no patients developed respiratory complications or thoracic deformity. One patient with malignant fibrous histiocytoma died of lung metastases 9 months postoperatively, another with malignant fibrous histiocytoma died of liver metastases 14 months postoperatively; the remaining patients survived without tumor recurrence. CONCLUSION Titanium mesh chest reconstruction after sternal tumor resection has the advantages of simplifying the procedure, achieving a good shape and having few complications. Titanium mesh is an ideal material for reconstruction of the sternum.","Zhang, Yan; Li, Jia-zhen; Hao, Ying-jie; Lu, Xin-chang; Shi, Hai-long; Liu, Yuan; Zhang, Peng-fei",Orthopaedic surgery,382,28

In particular, 96% of their questions to the rehabilitation manager could be cleared up during the sessions. However, roughly a third of those surveyed prefer personal contact with the rehabilitation manager. CONCLUSION Telecounselling is well received by the insured in the rehabilitation management of occupational insurance associations and offers a useful alternative when, due to lack of resources - such as lack of time or great distance - the rehabilitation plan cannot be prepared locally together with the insured patient. Under the special circumstances of the coronavirus pandemic, it can also contribute to protecting the health of all involved.","Limpert, Marion; Rindermann, Matthias; Hoffmann, Reinhard; Reimertz, Christoph",Zeitschrift fur Orthopadie und Unfallchirurgie,382,28

However, viruses have evolved multiple strategies to evade or thwart host antiviral responses. Viral inclusion bodies (IBs), which are accumulated aggregates of viral proteins, are commonly formed during the replication of some viruses in infected cells, but their role in viral immune evasion has rarely been explored. Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging febrile illness caused by a novel phlebovirus in the Bunyaviridae. The SFTS viral nonstructural protein NSs can suppress host beta interferon (IFN-β) responses. NSs can form IBs in infected and transfected cells. Through interaction with tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), viral NSs was able to sequester the IKK complex, including IKKε and IRF3, into IBs, although NSs did not interact with IKKε or IRF3 directly. When cells were infected with influenza A virus, IRF3 was phosphorylated and active phosphorylated IRF3 (p-IRF3) was translocated into the nucleus. In the presence of NSs, IRF3 could still be phosphorylated, but p-IRF3 was trapped in cytoplasmic IBs, resulting in reduced IFN-β induction and enhanced viral replication. Sequestration of the IKK complex and active IRF3 into viral IBs through the interaction of NSs and TBK1 is a novel mechanism for viral evasion of innate immunity.","Wu, Xiaodong; Qi, Xian; Qu, Bingqian; Zhang, Zerui; Liang, Mifang; Li, Chuan; Cardona, Carol J; Li, Dexin; Xing, Zheng",Journal of virology,382,24

The increasing number of cases of confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China is striking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation between chest CT findings and the clinical conditions of COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Data on 101 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively collected from four institutions in Hunan, China. Basic clinical characteristics and detailed imaging features were evaluated and compared between two groups on the basis of clinical status: nonemergency (mild or common disease) and emergency (severe or fatal disease). RESULTS. Patients 21-50 years old accounted for most (70.2%) of the cohort, and five (5.0%) patients had disease associated with a family outbreak. Most patients (78.2%) had fever as the onset symptom. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had typical imaging features, such as ground-glass opacities (GGO) (87 [86.1%]) or mixed GGO and consolidation (65 [64.4%]), vascular enlargement in the lesion (72 [71.3%]), and traction bronchiectasis (53 [52.5%]). Lesions present on CT images were more likely to have a peripheral distribution (88 [87.1%]) and bilateral involvement (83 [82.2%]) and be lower lung predominant (55 [54.5%]) and multifocal (55 [54.5%]). Patients in the emergency group were older than those in the non-emergency group. Architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis, and CT involvement score aided in evaluation of the severity and extent of the disease. CONCLUSION. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia have typical imaging features that can be helpful in early screening of highly suspected cases and in evaluation of the severity and extent of disease. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia have GGO or mixed GGO and consolidation and vascular enlargement in the lesion. Lesions are more likely to have peripheral distribution and bilateral involvement and be lower lung predominant and multifocal.

However, health is reported to be less active in climate adaptation than other sectors. To contribute to better understanding urban health adaptation efforts and identifying gaps we developed a City Climate Health Adaptation Typology and tested it with adaptation actions of 106 large world cities (population > 1 million) reported to a major publicly-available adaptation database. We found two-thirds of actions of these 'active adapter' cities were health-associated. Half were health information activities (e.g., hazard mapping, early warnings); and nearly one-third addressed climate-relevant health determinants in the urban built environment (e.g., green space). Forty percent of cities were in low- or middle-income countries. Our proposed typology provides a systematic framework for monitoring and comparing city health adaptation actions. Reported city actions are suggestive of increasing depth and breadth of urban health-associated adaptation. However, even among these adaptation-engaged cities, a health adaptation gap was apparent in key climate health services (e.g., mental health), and in climate-related public health governance and capacity building. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated pressing need for strong public health institutions. We recommend better integration of public health agencies into local climate action planning, enhanced modes of collaboration between health and non-health agencies and with non-governmental actors, and strengthening of city public health adaptive capacity including through networking.","Sheehan, Mary C; Freire, Mila; Martinez, Gerardo Sanchez",Environmental research,382,1

Opioid reduction is inherent in enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols, but little work has evaluated ERAS in these cases. OBJECTIVE To determine if ERAS could reduce postoperative opioid utilization in ambulatory anorectal surgery without sacrificing patient pain or satisfaction. METHODS A randomized controlled trial assigned ambulatory anorectal patients to ERAS (experimental) or routine care (surgeon's choice) for pain management (control) over 30-days postoperatively. Primary outcome was overall days of opioid use. Secondary outcomes included pain and satisfaction scores over multiple time points and new persistent opioid use. The Visual Analog Scale, Functional Pain Scale, and EQ-5D-3L measured patient-reported pain and satisfaction. Univariate analysis compared outcomes overall and at individual time points. Two-way mixed ANOVA evaluated pain and satisfaction measures between groups and over time. RESULTS Thirty-two patients were randomized into each arm (64 total). The control group consumed significantly more opioids after discharge(median 121.3MME vs 23.5MME, P < 0.001). Significantly more control patients requested additional narcotics (P = 0.004), made unplanned calls (P = 0.009), and had unplanned clinic visits (P = 0.003). The control group had significantly more days on opioids (mean 14.4 vs 2.2, P < 0.001). Three control patients (9.4%) versus no experimental patients had new persistent opioid use. The mean global health, EQ5D-3L, Visual Analog Scale, and Functional Pain scores were comparable between groups over time. CONCLUSIONS An ERAS protocol in ambulatory anorectal surgery is feasible, and resulted in reduced opioid use, and healthcare utilization, with no difference in pain or patient satisfaction. This challenges the paradigm that extended opioids are needed for effective postoperative pain management.","de Paula, Thais Reif; Nemeth, Samantha K; Kurlansky, Paul; Simon, Hillary L; Miller, Lydia L; Keller, Deborah S",Annals of surgery,382,1

This catheter, together with a regular ICU ventilator, can provide coaxial ventilation. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of ventilation in adult human-sized swine using an ECFC and a regular ICU ventilator. DESIGN A prospective animal study. SETTING Experimental, Trauma Transplant Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. ANIMALS Eight adult Yorkshire swine, weighing 45 to 50 kg, were studied. INTERVENTIONS To create the ECFC, a 5 cm long latex cuff was placed over the distal side ports of either a 14 or 19-Fr gauge endotracheal catheter and a 1 cm long piece of plastic tube was inserted into the tip of the endotracheal catheter to create an internal resistance. The ECFC was placed into the trachea and the proximal end of the ECFC was connected to an ICU ventilator in pressure-control mode, with peak pressures set at either 25, 50 or 70 cmH2O. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Tidal volume was calculated using plethysmography. RESULTS During pressure control ventilation with the 14-Fr gauge ECFC at set inspiratory pressures of 25, 50 and 75 cmH2O, the tidal volumes generated were 209 ± 36, 309 ± 61 and 367 ± 85 ml, respectively, and with the 19-Fr gauge ECFC these were 277 ± 51, 442 ± 91 and 538 ± 123 ml, respectively. No complications were observed. CONCLUSION An ECFC combined with a regular pressure-controlled ICU ventilator can produce adequate tidal volumes in adult human-sized swine. Our results establish the feasibility of ventilation with this new alternative technique. The safety and advantages of such a technique remain to be determined in humans.","Oto, Jun; Su, Zhenbo; Duggan, Michael; Wang, Jingwen; King, David R; Kacmarek, Robert M; Jiang, Yandong",European journal of anaesthesiology,382,1

This study collected prevention and treatment approaches of traditional Chinese medicine for COVID-19 released from the National Health Committee of China, 7 provinces and municipal health committees, the Chinese Medicine Administration and Handbook of Traditional Chinese Medicine Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 between January 1 and February 18, 2020, and prescriptions prepared by 3 masters of Chinese medicine and 4 well-known Chinese medicine experts. These information were selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and EpiData 3.0 software was used to establish the ""Traditional Chinese Medicine Prescription Library for the Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19"" and the ""Common Database of Traditional Chinese Medicine for the Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19"". A total of 93 effective Chinese medicine prescriptions and a total of 157 kinds of constituent medicines were collected. Data analysis was performed by SPSS 18.0 software. The results showed that: ①most of the medicines are with cold and warm properties, 69 with cold medicines, accounting for 43.95%, 57 with warm medicines, accounting for 36.31%, and less with hot medicines, taking up 1.27%; ②there are many pungent, bitter and sweet medicines, and the distribution of medicinal flavors is different at different disease stage. The pungent medicines are mostly found in the early stage, the bitter drugs are the main flavor in the middle and severe stage, and the sweet medicines are mostly used in the recovery stage; ③the meridian of the drug is more concentrated at the lung, stomach, and heart, and most of drugs are into the lung meridian, accounting for 24.55%; these medicines are mostly into the lungs and stomach in the initial and middle stages, and into the heart and kidney in severe stages; ④oral drugs are mostly non-toxic, among which only 6 kinds are toxic, namely Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Dryopteridis Crassirhizomatis Rhizoma, Paridis Rhizoma, Pinelliae Rhizoma, Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparaia; ⑤most of the drugs have five types of functions: treating exterior syndromes, resolving dampness, clearing heat, replenishing deficiency, resolving phlegm, cough, and asthma.

Non-pharmacological treatments for TTH are widely used as a supplement or an alternative to medical treatment. However, the evidence for their effects are limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to review the evidence for manual joint mobilisation techniques, supervised physical activity, psychological treatment, acupuncture and patient education as treatments for TTH on the effect of headache frequency and quality of life. METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted from February to July 2020 for clinical guidelines, systematic reviews, and individual randomised controlled trials (RCT). The primary outcomes measured were days with headache and quality of life at the end of treatment along with a number of secondary outcomes. Meta-analyses were performed on eligible RCTs and pooled estimates of effects were calculated using the random-effect model. The overall certainty of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach (GRADE). In addition, patient preferences were included in the evaluation. RESULTS In all, 13 RCTs were included. Acupuncture might have positive effects on both primary outcomes. Supervised physical activity might have a positive effect on pain intensity at the end of treatment and headache frequency at follow-up. Manual joint mobilisation techniques might have a positive effect on headache frequency and quality of life at follow-up. Psychological treatment might have a positive effect on stress symptoms at the end of treatment. No relevant RCTs were identified for patient education. The overall certainty of evidence was downgraded to low and very low. No serious adverse events were reported. A consensus recommendation was made for patient education and weak recommendations for the other interventions. CONCLUSION Based on identified benefits, certainty of evidence, and patient preferences, manual joint mobilisation techniques, supervised physical activity, psychological treatment, acupuncture, and patient education can be considered as non-pharmacological treatment approaches for TTH. Some positive effects were shown on headache frequency, quality of life, pain intensity and stress symptoms. Few studies and low sample sizes posed a challenge in drawing solid conclusions.

The CNS involvement of the virus is not trivial; although the brain has highly protective systems, the virus has ways to breach them with a destructive potential. For successful entry of the virus, different possible routes with favorable mechanisms are used. The SARS-CoV-2 invasion induces a mechanism of both the innate and adaptive immune response to control virus replication and removal from the CNS tissues. The cytokine storm and autoimmune response during the immunological events result in demyelination, damage of resident cells and neurons, cerebrovascular thrombosis, and dysregulation of neuro signaling pathways. Furthermore, hypoxia and toxemia accelerate the neurological destruction process.

Currently available systems cannot reliably assess the pH environment across wounds, which is the objective of this study. Approach: A disposable device, DETEC® pH, was developed and characterized on its ability to map wound alkalinity by pressing a freshly recovered wound dressing against its test surface. By comparing the wound's alkalinity and size reduction rates (∼7 days) following pH measurement, we assessed the capability of wound alkalinity to prognosticate subsequent short-term wound size reduction rates. Results: The device had high accuracy and specificity in determining the alkalinity of simulated wound fluids soaked onto wound dressing. The type of wound dressing type had an insignificant effect on its detection sensitivity. Upon testing discarded wound dressings from human patients, the device quickly determined alkaline and acidic wounds. Finally, statistical analyses of wound size reduction rates in wounds with various alkalinities confirmed that wound alkalinity has a strong influence on, at least, short-term wound healing activity. Innovation: Without directly contacting the patient, this device provides a quick assessment of wound alkalinity to prognosticate immediate and short-term wound healing activities. Conclusion: DETEC® pH may serve as a prognosis device for wound care specialists during routine wound assessment to predict wound healing progress. This information can assist the decision-making process in a clinical setting and augur well for chronic wound treatment. DETEC® pH can also be used as an aid for home health care nurses or health care providers to screen nonhealing wounds outside clinics.","Vu, Hong; Nair, Ashwin; Tran, Lan; Pal, Suvra; Senkowsky, Jon; Hu, Wenjing; Tang, Liping",Advances in wound care,382,1

Throughout the last decades, several studies in human cohorts and animal models have revealed a plethora of age-related changes in the brain, including reduced neurogenesis, oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction and cell senescence. As the main immune effectors and first responders of the nervous tissue, microglia are at the center of these events. These cells experience irrevocable changes as a result from cumulative exposure to environmental triggers, such as stress, infection and metabolic dysregulation. The age-related immunosenescent phenotype acquired by microglia is characterized by profound modifications in their transcriptomic profile, secretome, morphology and phagocytic activity, which compromise both their housekeeping and defensive functions. As a result, aged microglia are no longer capable of establishing effective immune responses and sustaining normal synaptic activity, directly contributing to age-associated cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. This review discusses how lifestyle and environmental factors drive microglia dysfunction at the molecular and functional level, also highlighting possible interventions to reverse aging-associated damage to the nervous and immune systems.","Costa, Jéssica; Martins, Solange; Ferreira, Pedro; Cardoso, Ana M S; Guedes, Joana R; Peça, João M; Cardoso, Ana L",Mechanisms of ageing and development,382,1

They accumulate in the normal aging brain, and are inherent to neurodegenerative disorders and their associated pathologies. A prominent example of this is the brain accumulation of metals such as Ca, Fe and Cu (and more ambiguously, Zn) associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The natural stable isotope compositions of such metals have also shown utility in constraining biological mechanisms, and in differentiating between healthy and diseased states, sometimes prior to conventional methods. Here we have detailed the distribution of the biologically relevant elements Mg, P, K, Ca, Fe, Cu and Zn in brain regions of Göttingen minipigs ranging in age from three months to nearly six years, including control animals and both a single- and double-transgenic model of AD (PS1, APP/PS1). Moreover, we have characterized the Ca isotope composition of the brain for the first time. Concentration data track rises in brain biometals with age, namely for Fe and Cu, as observed in the normal ageing brain and in AD, and biometal data point to increased soluble amyloid beta (Aβ) load prior to AD plaque identification via brain imaging. Calcium isotope results define the brain as the isotopically lightest permanent reservoir in the body, indicating that brain Ca dyshomeostasis may induce measurable isotopic disturbances in accessible downstream reservoirs such as biofluids.","Mahan, Brandon; Antonelli, Michael A; Burckel, Pierre; Turner, Simon; Chung, Roger; Habekost, Mette; Jørgensen, Arne Lund; Moynier, Frédéric",Metallomics : integrated biometal science,382,1

However, these places had reported new cases and experienced a second wave since June 11, 2020. Here we develop a stochastic discrete-time epidemic model to evaluate the risk of COVID-19 resurgence by analyzing the data from the beginning of the outbreak to the second wave in these three places. In the model, we use an input parameter to represent a few potential risks that may cause a second wave, including asymptomatic infection, imported cases from other places, and virus from the environment such as frozen food packages. The effect of physical distancing restrictions imposed at different stages of the outbreak is also included in the model. Model simulations show that the magnitude of the input and the time between the initial entry and subsequent case confirmation significantly affect the probability of the second wave occurrence. Although the susceptible population size does not change the probability of resurgence, it can influence the severity of the outbreak when a second wave occurs. Therefore, to prevent the occurrence of a future wave, timely screening and detection are needed to identify infected cases in the early stage of infection. When infected cases appear, various measures such as contact tracing and quarantine should be followed to reduce the size of susceptible population in order to mitigate the COVID-19 outbreak.","He, Sha; Yang, Jie; He, Mengqi; Yan, Dingding; Tang, Sanyi; Rong, Libin",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,382,2

Available information on CT features of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is scattered in different publications, and a cohesive literature review has yet to be compiled. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This article includes a systematic literature search of PubMed, Embase (Elsevier), Google Scholar, and the World Health Organization database. RESULTS. Known features of COVID-19 on initial CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacification (GGO) with a peripheral or posterior distribution, mainly in the lower lobes and less frequently within the right middle lobe. Atypical initial imaging presentation of consolidative opacities superimposed on GGO may be found in a smaller number of cases, mainly in the elderly population. Septal thickening, bronchiectasis, pleural thickening, and subpleural involvement are some of the less common findings, mainly in the later stages of the disease. Pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, lymphadenopathy, cavitation, CT halo sign, and pneumothorax are uncommon but may be seen with disease progression. Follow-up CT in the intermediate stage of disease shows an increase in the number and size of GGOs and progressive transformation of GGO into multifocal consolidative opacities, septal thickening, and development of a crazy paving pattern, with the greatest severity of CT findings visible around day 10 after the symptom onset. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is the most common indication for transferring patients with COVID-19 to the ICU and the major cause of death in this patient population. Imaging patterns corresponding to clinical improvement usually occur after week 2 of the disease and include gradual resolution of consolidative opacities and decrease in the number of lesions and involved lobes.

METHODS The present study analyzed 183 cases of small bowel capsule endoscope (SBCE) insertion performed using the AdvanCE in 154 patients aged less than 18 years at participating institutions between 2013 and 2017. Statistical analyses were conducted to identify factors contributing to the completion rate for the entire small intestine examination, small intestine transit time, adverse events and technical issues. RESULTS The commonest reason for using the AdvanCE was the patient's inability to swallow the SBCE, which was attributed to young age. SBCE was successfully delivered into the stomach or duodenum in 180 cases and was placed in the duodenum in 90% patients. In 89% patients, the entire small intestine was completely examined, and in 63% patients, findings leading to a new diagnosis or involving changing or maintaining the treatment strategy were obtained. No severe adverse events were observed; however, mild adverse events were observed in 35% patients. No factors considerably contributed to the completion rate for the entire small intestine examination or small intestine transit time and onset of technical issues. The factors that contributed to mild adverse events included intravenous anesthesia, technical issue, and absence of prior insertion of a patency capsule using the AdvanCE.

The role of children and adolescents in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on susceptibility, symptoms, viral load, social contact patterns, and behavior. Objective To systematically review the susceptibility to and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among children and adolescents compared with adults. Data Sources PubMed and medRxiv were searched from database inception to July 28, 2020, and a total of 13 926 studies were identified, with additional studies identified through hand searching of cited references and professional contacts. Study Selection Studies that provided data on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in children and adolescents (younger than 20 years) compared with adults (20 years and older) derived from contact tracing or population screening were included. Single-household studies were excluded. Data Extraction and Synthesis PRISMA guidelines for abstracting data were followed, which was performed independently by 2 reviewers. Quality was assessed using a critical appraisal checklist for prevalence studies. Random-effects meta-analysis was undertaken. Main Outcomes and Measures Secondary infection rate (contact-tracing studies) or prevalence or seroprevalence (population screening studies) among children and adolescents compared with adults. Results A total of 32 studies comprising 41 640 children and adolescents and 268 945 adults met inclusion criteria, including 18 contact-tracing studies and 14 population screening studies. The pooled odds ratio of being an infected contact in children compared with adults was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.37-0.85), with substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 94.6%). Three school-based contact-tracing studies found minimal transmission from child or teacher index cases. Findings from population screening studies were heterogenous and were not suitable for meta-analysis. Most studies were consistent with lower seroprevalence in children compared with adults, although seroprevalence in adolescents appeared similar to adults. Conclusions and Relevance In this meta-analysis, there is preliminary evidence that children and adolescents have lower susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, with an odds ratio of 0.56 for being an infected contact compared with adults. There is weak evidence that children and adolescents play a lesser role than adults in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at a population level. This study provides no information on the infectivity of children.","Viner, Russell M; Mytton, Oliver T; Bonell, Chris; Melendez-Torres, G J; Ward, Joseph; Hudson, Lee; Waddington, Claire; Thomas, James; Russell, Simon; van der Klis, Fiona; Koirala, Archana; Ladhani, Shamez; Panovska-Griffiths, Jasmina; Davies, Nicholas G; Booy, Robert; Eggo, Rosalind M",JAMA pediatrics,382,5

Throughout this pandemic, healthcare professionals have experienced difficulties stemming from poor communications, resource scarcity, lack of transparency, disbelief, and threats to the safety of their loved ones, their patients, and themselves. As part of these hardships, negative statements have been heard repeatedly. This paper describes 11 scenarios of unhelpful and dysfunctional messages heard by the authors and their colleagues during the COVID-19 pandemic, reported to us by a combination of peers, administrative leadership, and the public. We explain why not to use such messaging, and we suggest more helpful and compassionate expressions based upon recommendations published by scientific organizations and well-established psychological principles. The first 10 scenarios discussed include 1) lack of understanding regarding the extent of the pandemic, 2) shaming over not seeing patients in person, 3) lack of clear and consistent communication from leadership on pandemic-related practice changes, 4) opinions that personal protective equipment use by healthcare professionals causes fear or is unnecessary, 5) forcing in-person care without appropriate personal protective equipment, 6) the risk of exposure to asymptomatic individuals as it relates to opening clinics, 7) media gag orders, 8) pay and benefit reductions, 9) spreading of misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic, and 10) workload expectations. The 11th scenario addresses healthcare professionals' psychological and physical reactions to this challenging and prolonged stressful situation. We close by discussing the need for support and compassion at this difficult and unpredictable time and by offering suggestions to foster resilience and feelings of self-efficacy among healthcare professionals.","Robblee, Jennifer; Buse, Dawn C; Halker Singh, Rashmi B; Schusse, Courtney M; Riggins, Nina; Rayhill, Melissa L; Loder, Elizabeth W; Donnelly, Megan; Borrero-Mejias, Clarimar",Headache,382,1

A conserved step of CoV replication is the translation and processing of replicase polyproteins containing 16 nonstructural protein domains (nsp's 1 to 16). The CoV nsp5 protease (3CLpro; Mpro) processes nsp's at 11 cleavage sites and is essential for virus replication. CoV nsp5 has a conserved 3-domain structure and catalytic residues. However, the intra- and intermolecular determinants of nsp5 activity and their conservation across divergent CoVs are unknown, in part due to challenges in cultivating many human and zoonotic CoVs. To test for conservation of nsp5 structure-function determinants, we engineered chimeric betacoronavirus murine hepatitis virus (MHV) genomes encoding nsp5 proteases of human and bat alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses. Exchange of nsp5 proteases from HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, which share the same genogroup, genogroup 2a, with MHV, allowed for immediate viral recovery with efficient replication albeit with impaired fitness in direct competition with wild-type MHV. Introduction of MHV nsp5 temperature-sensitive mutations into chimeric HKU1 and OC43 nsp5 proteases resulted in clear differences in viability and temperature-sensitive phenotypes compared with MHV nsp5. These data indicate tight genetic linkage and coevolution between nsp5 protease and the genomic background and identify differences in intramolecular networks regulating nsp5 function. Our results also provide evidence that chimeric viruses within coronavirus genogroups can be used to test nsp5 determinants of function and inhibition in common isogenic backgrounds and cell types.","Stobart, Christopher C; Sexton, Nicole R; Munjal, Havisha; Lu, Xiaotao; Molland, Katrina L; Tomar, Sakshi; Mesecar, Andrew D; Denison, Mark R",Journal of virology,382,31

This scoping review will help elucidate key elements affecting the developmental trajectory of communicative systems, typically robust and well-developed by formal school entry. We aim to (1) map the current state of the literature in a growing field of interest that has the potential to advance knowledge translation, (2) identify existing gaps and (3) provide research direction for future investigations surrounding feeding-swallowing functions and environment that support or forestall communication development in young children. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We are proposing a scoping review to identify the breadth and depth of the existing literature regarding swallowing-feeding functions and environment relative to the onset and progression of communicative behaviours from infancy to 6 (<6;0) years of age. Our protocol delineates rigorous methods according to Arskey and O'Malley's framework and includes elaborations by Levac and colleagues. We will search the literature based on 10 databases, 17 peer-reviewed journals, 4 conference proceedings and 6 grey literature sources. Two authors will independently screen abstracts and review full articles, remaining blind to each other's results. A third author will contribute to resolving any discrepant results from both the abstract and article review. Subsequently, we will extract data and chart information from accepted articles using a pre-established data collection form. We will stratify results according to healthy versus impaired swallowing-feeding functions and communication development. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Our scoping review does not require ethical approval. We will disseminate our final study results through international and national conference presentations, publication in a peer-reviewed journal and knowledge translation activities with stakeholders.","Flowers, Heather; Bérubé, Daniel; Ebrahimipour, Mona; Perrier, Marie-France; Moloci, Sarah; Skoretz, Stacey",BMJ open,382,1

Methods: Based on the case data reported in Hubei province during the COVID-19 epidemic, combined with the important time of major interventions and event, the cumulative attack rate, the sequential increase rate of new cases, baseline increase rate of new cases, the observation- confirmed case conversion rate, the cumulative crude mortality, the daily severe case rate, and the ratio of death to severe were used to describe and analyze the epidemic characteristics in different phases of the COVID-19 epidemic. Results: The epidemic experienced an outbreak phase from January 10 to February 3 with large amount of case reported, a peak phase from February 4 to February 19 with continuous increasing number of new cases and deaths, a platform phase from February 20 to March 3 with balanced diagnosis and treatment number, and a descending phase from March 4 to March 18 with decreased diagnosis and increased treatment number. Up to March 18, the cumulative attack rate of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei province increased from 0.03/10 000 on January 19 to 11.46/10 000, from 0.04/10 000 on January 10 to 45.13/10 000 in Wuhan city, and from 0.002/ 10 000 on January 20 to 3.70/ 10 000 in other areas of Hubei province other than Wuhan city. The increase rate of new cases fluctuated during the epidemic period and reached the highest at February 12 in Hubei province. The cumulative crude mortality in Hubei Province increased rapidly from 1.01% on January 19 to 5.13% on January 26, then decreased to 2.54% on February 13, and then slowly increased to 4.62% on March 18, and similar trend was also observed in Wuhan city. The daily severe rate in Hubei Province increased from 26.88% on January 27 to 34.27% on March 18. The ratio of death to severe decreased from 7.37% on January 23 to 0.35% on March 18. Conclusions: The epidemic cycle of COVID-19 in Hubei province proposed to be 60 days, which was about 1.76 times of the combination of the longest incubation period or isolation period (14 d) and the average hospitalization time of confirmed patients in Hubei province (20 d).

G4 participates in multiple biological processes including gene transcription, and G4-targeted ligands serve as potential therapeutic agents for DNA-targeted therapies. However, genome-wide studies of the exact roles of G4s in transcriptional regulation are still lacking. Here, we establish a sensitive G4-CUT&Tag method for genome-wide profiling of native G4s with high resolution and specificity. We find that native G4 signals are cell type-specific and are associated with transcriptional regulatory elements carrying active epigenetic modifications. Drug-induced promoter-proximal RNA polymerase II pausing promotes nearby G4 formation. In contrast, G4 stabilization by G4-targeted ligands globally reduces RNA polymerase II occupancy at gene promoters as well as nascent RNA synthesis. Moreover, ligand-induced G4 stabilization modulates chromatin states and impedes transcription initiation via inhibition of general transcription factors loading to promoters. Together, our study reveals a reciprocal genome-wide regulation between native G4 dynamics and gene transcription, which will deepen our understanding of G4 biology toward therapeutically targeting G4s in human diseases.","Li, Conghui; Wang, Honghong; Yin, Zhinang; Fang, Pingping; Xiao, Ruijing; Xiang, Ying; Wang, Wen; Li, Qiuzi; Huang, Beili; Huang, Jian; Liang, Kaiwei",Genome research,382,1

In this paper, we report the case of a 68-year-old woman who presented with colicky left abdominal pain. After computed tomography (CT) scan and anterograde pyelography, she was diagnosed ureterosciatic hernia with obstructive uropathy. We performed ureteral balloon dilatation and double-J ureteral stent placement. After this minimally invasive procedure, CT scan demonstrated that the left ureter had returned to its normal anatomical position without looping into the sciatic foramen. The patient remained asymptomatic with no adverse events 7 years after the minimally invasive procedures.

Although most cases are mild, there are a considerable number of patients who develop pneumonia or even acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). After having recovered from the initial disease, many patients continue with various symptoms (fatigue, dry cough, fever, dyspnea, anosmia, and chest pain, among others.), which has led to consider the possible existence of ""post-COVID-19 syndrome"". Although the definition and validity of this syndrome are not clear yet, several studies report that individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 may have persistent symptoms, radiological abnormalities, and compromised respiratory function. Current evidence suggests that there is a large number of pulmonary sequelae after COVID-19 pneumonia (interstitial thickening, ground glass opacities, crazy paving pattern, and bronchiectasis, among others.). Likewise, it seems that pulmonary function tests (spirometry, DLCO, 6MWT, and measurement of maximum respiratory pressures), in addition to high-resolution computed axial tomographies (CAT scan), are useful for the assessment of these post-COVID-19 pulmonary sequelae. This review aims to describe the possible pulmonary sequelae after COVID-19 pneumonia, as well as to suggest diagnostic procedures for their correct assessment and follow-up; thus, allowing proper management by a multidisciplinary medical team.","Chérrez-Ojeda, Iván; Gochicoa-Rangel, Laura; Salles-Rojas, Antonio; Mautong, Hans",Revista alergia Mexico,382,31

RECENT FINDINGS Observational data suggest that mean arterial pressure (MAP) below 65-75 mmHg in PCA patients is associated with worse outcome. A higher MAP could be beneficial in patients with chronic hypertension who more frequently have a right shift of the cerebral autoregulation curve. Two recent randomized pilot trials compared lower and higher MAP targets during PCA care and found no significant effect on biomarkers of neurological injury. The haemodynamic interventions in those studies did not use any cerebral perfusion endpoints beyond a static MAP targets during ICU stay. Individualized, dynamic MAP targets based on assessments of cerebral perfusion and tailored to the specifics of the patient, cardiac arrest circumstances and treatment responses may be more conducive to improved outcomes. Pilot data suggest that near infrared spectroscopy monitoring may be used to determine the cerebral autoregulatory capacity and an optimal MAP, but this approach is yet to be tested in clinical trials. SUMMARY Current evidence suggests targeting a MAP of at least 65-75 mmHg in PCA patients. Future studies should focus on whether certain patient groups could benefit from higher and dynamic MAP targets.","Skrifvars, Markus B; Åneman, Anders; Ameloot, Koen",Current opinion in critical care,382,24

The present review focuses on the biology of feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection and the pathogenesis and pathological features of FIP. Recent studies have revealed functions of many viral proteins, differing receptor specificity for type I and type II FCoV, and genomic differences between feline enteric coronaviruses (FECVs) and FIP viruses (FIPVs). FECV and FIP also exhibit functional differences, since FECVs replicate mainly in intestinal epithelium and are shed in feces, and FIPVs replicate efficiently in monocytes and induce systemic disease. Thus, key events in the pathogenesis of FIP are systemic infection with FIPV, effective and sustainable viral replication in monocytes, and activation of infected monocytes. The host's genetics and immune system also play important roles. It is the activation of monocytes and macrophages that directly leads to the pathologic features of FIP, including vasculitis, body cavity effusions, and fibrinous and granulomatous inflammatory lesions. Advances have been made in the clinical diagnosis of FIP, based on the clinical pathologic findings, serologic testing, and detection of virus using molecular (polymerase chain reaction) or antibody-based methods. Nevertheless, the clinical diagnosis remains challenging in particular in the dry form of FIP, which is partly due to the incomplete understanding of infection biology and pathogenesis in FIP. So, while much progress has been made, many aspects of FIP pathogenesis still remain an enigma.","Kipar, A; Meli, M L",Veterinary pathology,382,11

BMD generally increases following parathyroidectomy, however longitudinal changes to other DXA-derived parameters, the trabecular bone score (TBS) and hip structural analysis (HSA), have not been described. Postoperative calcium requirements and positive calcium balance raise concerns for an increased risk of vascular calcification. This case illustrates the dramatic increase in BMD that can follow parathyroidectomy in a patient on dialysis, and for the first time demonstrates improvements to HSA parameters and to the TBS. CASE PRESENTATION A 30-year old woman on haemodialysis underwent subtotal parathyroidectomy for secondary hyperparathyroidism. She developed a post-operative 'hungry bone syndrome' requiring substantial calcium and calcitriol supplementation. Six months post-parathyroidectomy, BMD increased by 42% at the lumbar spine, 30% at the femoral neck and 25% at the total proximal femur, with increases sustained over the following 18 months. The TBS increased by 8%. HSA showed a 63% increase in femoral neck cortical thickness and 38% reduction in the buckling ratio, consistent with increased femoral neck stability. The abdominal aortic vascular calcification score (0-24) increased from zero 8-years pre-parathyroidectomy to 2/24 at 18-months post-parathyroidectomy. CONCLUSION BMD losses incurred by secondary hyperparathyroidism recover rapidly after parathyroidectomy, particularly at sites of trabecular bone. Bone architectural parameters, measured as the TBS and by HSA, also improve. Greater BMD gains may be associated with higher post-operative calcium requirements. While bone is the major reservoir for post-parathyroidectomy calcium supplementation, positive calcium balance may contribute to vascular calcification risk.","Lin, Raymond; Vucak-Dzumhur, Mirna; Elder, Grahame J",BMC nephrology,382,31

Conversely, laparoscopic surgical treatment has to be considered when symptoms relief are not optimal or with signs of bowel occlusion. METHODS Retrospective experience of consecutive series of patients who referred to a third-level referral center with suspected bowel DE and failure of multiple medical treatments. After an intraoperative evaluation of nodule size with a rectal shaving of its external portion, patients underwent radical DE eradication with concomitant disc excision in rectal nodules < 3 cm with no signs of substantial full-thickness infiltration. RESULTS A total of 371 patients were considered eligible for analysis, with a median age of 37 years. The median operative time of was 180 min, with an estimated blood loss of 100 mL and a median diameter of removed rectal nodule of 25 mm.

A gold diagnostic standard does not exist. The aim of the current study was to determine the prevalence of unrecognized periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) in a cohort of revision for AF, using an experimental diagnostic algorithm. METHODS The surgeons' suspicion of AF was based primarily on patient history and clinical evaluation. X-ray imaging was used to reveal mechanical problems. To rule out an infectious aetiology standard blood biochemical tests were ordered in most patients. Evaluation followed the existing practice in the institute. Cases were included if revision surgery was planned for suspected AF. Intraoperatively, five synovial tissue biopsies were obtained routinely. PJI was defined as ≥3 positive cultures with the same microorganism(s). Patients were followed for 1 year postoperatively. Protocol samples included joint fluid, additional synovial tissue biopsies, bone biopsy, swabs from the implant surface, and sonication of retrieved components. Routine and protocol samples were cultured with extended incubation (14 days) and preserved for batchwise 16S rRNA gene amplification. Patients were stratified based on culture results and a clinical status was obtained at study end. RESULTS A total of 72 revisions were performed on 71 patients (35 THA and 37 TKA). We found five of 72 cases of unrecognized PJI. Extended culture and protocol samples accounted for two of these. One patient diagnosed with AF was treated for a PJI during follow-up. The remaining patients did not change status from AF during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS We found a low prevalence of unrecognized periprosthetic joint infections in patients with an AF diagnosis. The algorithm strengthens the surgeons' preoperative diagnosis of a non-infective condition. Evaluation for a failing TKA or THA is complex. Distinguishing between AF and PJI pre-operatively was a clinical decision. Our data did not support additional testing in routine revision surgery for AF.","Khalid, Vesal; Schønheyder, Henrik Carl; Nielsen, Poul Torben; Kappel, Andreas; Thomsen, Trine Rolighed; Aleksyniene, Ramune; Lorenzen, Jan; Rasmussen, Sten",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,382,7

The objective of this systematic review is to examine the evidence of measured and perceived effects of A&F interventions on nurses' performance. METHODS A mixed methods systematic review design with thematic and narrative synthesis is used. Studies reporting quantitative and qualitative data on the effects of A&F interventions specific to nursing care are considered for inclusion. Studies will be appraised for quality using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Quantitative and qualitative data will be summarized in narrative and tabular form and will be synthetized using a segregated methodologies approach. DISCUSSION Results will describe the characteristics of A&F with nurses, as well as the measured and perceived effects specific to nursing care.

Variables associated with higher odds of intraparenchymal hemorrhage included treatment of ruptured aneurysms (OR, 4.44; 95% CI, 1.65-11.94; P = .005) and the use of ≥ 3 Pipeline Embolization Devices (OR, 4.10; 95% CI, 1.34-12.58; P = .04). The Shuttle sheath was not associated with intraparenchymal hemorrhage (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.38-2.45; P = .95). CONCLUSIONS Spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage following Pipeline Embolization Device treatment is a rare-but-devastating complication, with nearly all patients having morbidity or mortality. Variables associated with intraparenchymal hemorrhage included the use of multiple Pipeline Embolization Devices and treatment of ruptured aneurysms. The Shuttle, a device that was previously thought to be associated with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, was not associated with it.","Brinjikji, W; Lanzino, G; Cloft, H J; Siddiqui, A H; Kallmes, D F",AJNR.

METHODS Forty extracted intact human first premolars were imaged with micro-CT and randomly assigned to the contracted endodontic cavity (CEC) or traditional endodontic cavity (TEC) groups. CEC was prepared with the aid of a 3D-printed template, canals were prepared with a 0.04 taper M-Two rotary instrument, and cavities were restored with resin. Specimens were loaded to fracture in an Instron Universal Testing Machine after a fatigue phase. The data were analyzed by the independent samples T test and Mann-Whitney U test, appropriate post hoc tests. RESULTS In the premolars tested in vitro, the percentage of dentin removed in the premolars with two dental roots in the CEC group (3.85% ± 0.42%) was significantly smaller (P < 0.05) than in the TEC group (4.94% ± 0.5%). The untouched canal wall (UCW) after instrumentation for TECs (16.43% ± 6.56%) was significantly lower (P < .05) than the UCW (24.42% ± 9.19%) for CECs in single-rooted premolars. No significant differences were observed in the increased canal volume and surface areas in premolars between the TEC and CEC groups (P > 0.05). CECs conserved coronal dentin in premolars with two dental roots but no impact on the instrument efficacy. There were no differences between the CEC groups and the TEC groups in the percentage of filling material and voids (P > 0.05). In addition, the mean load at failure of premolars did not significantly differ between the CEC and TEC groups and there was no significant difference in the type of fracture (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION The results of this study suggest that CEC could not improve the fracture resistance of the endodontically treated premolars. The instrumentation efficacy and the percentage of filling material did not significantly differ between CECs and TECs in premolars.","Xia, Juan; Wang, Weidong; Li, Zhengmao; Lin, Bingpeng; Zhang, Qian; Jiang, Qianzhou; Yang, Xuechao",BMC oral health,382,1

The goal of the project was to evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of our approaches in meeting <797> requirements. METHODS USP <797> standards, radiation safety concerns, and work-flow patterns were the focal points in our assessment of 4 laboratories: 2 nuclear pharmacy laboratories that engage in preparing sterile (low-, medium-, and high-risk levels), nonsterile, or possible hazardous radioactive drugs and 2 other laboratories in which only low-risk-level preparations are involved. RESULTS Each laboratory was constructed with a physically separated International Organization for Standardization Class 7 anteroom and clean room to allow us to maintain an appropriate air quality, a consistent operation, and a desirable flexibility. An isolated area within the laboratory was designated for preparing nonsterile products. Higher air change per hour was used in the areas with higher traffic or smaller space. Lead-lined biological safety cabinets (BSCs) were segregated and used depending on the risk category of the preparations. In 1 laboratory, the exhaust flow for the BSC was too great, and a lead-lined compounding aseptic containment isolator (CACI) was installed. Air in the BSC and CACI was 100% exhausted to the atmosphere. 99Mo/99mTc generators were placed in the negative-pressure clean room to ensure a more efficient operation and cleaner air environment. Clean-room equipment (i.e., keyboards, printers, and telephones) was installed, and refrigerators or freezers and the central-processing unit of each computer were placed outside clean room. CONCLUSION Our wide-range preparations of sterile, nonsterile, or potential hazardous radiopharmaceuticals, coupled with the limited space of each laboratory and existing antiquated mechanical systems, presented a challenge. Nevertheless, we successfully remodeled each nuclear pharmacy laboratory to meet USP <797> requirements for facility design and environmental controls.","Hung, Joseph C; Anderson, Michelle M","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",382,23

We assessed whether 6-monthly ART dispensing was non-inferior to standard of care and 3-monthly ART dispensing. METHODS We did a pragmatic, cluster-randomised, unblinded, non-inferiority trial (INTERVAL) at 30 health facilities in Malawi and Zambia. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older, HIV-positive, and were clinically stable on ART. Before randomisation, health facilities (clusters) were matched on the basis of country, ART cohort size, facility type (ie, hospital vs health centre), and region or province. Matched clusters were randomly allocated (1:1:1) to standard of care, 3-monthly ART dispensing, or 6-monthly ART dispensing using a simple random allocation sequence. The primary outcome was retention in care at 12 months, defined as the proportion of patients with less than 60 consecutive days without ART during study follow-up, analysed by intention to treat. A 2·5% margin was used to assess non-inferiority. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03101592. FINDINGS Between May 15, 2017, and April 30, 2018, 9118 participants were randomly assigned, of whom 8719 participants (n=3012, standard of care group; n=2726, 3-monthly ART dispensing group; n=2981, 6-monthly ART dispensing group) had primary outcome data available at 12 months and were included in the primary analysis. The median age of participants was 42·7 years (IQR 36·1-49·9) and 5774 (66·2%) of 8719 were women. The primary outcome was met by 2478 (82·3%) of 3012 participants in the standard of care group, 2356 (86·4%) of 2726 participants in the 3-monthly ART dispensing group, and 2729 (91·5%) of 2981 participants in the 6-monthly ART dispensing group. After adjusting for clustering, for retention in care at 12 months, the 6-monthly ART dispensing group was non-inferior to the standard of care group (percentage-point increase 9·1 [95% CI 0·9-17·2]) and to the 3-monthly ART dispensing group (5·0% [1·0-9·1]). INTERPRETATION Clinical visits with ART dispensing every 6 months was non-inferior to standard of care and 3-monthly ART dispensing. 6-monthly ART dispensing is a promising strategy for the expansion of ART provision and achievement of HIV treatment targets in resource-constrained settings.

From November 2008 to October 2010, 10 patients with SRMs underwent laparoscopy-guided Tru-Cut biopsy, MW tumour ablation, and enucleation. Mean age was 66 yr (range: 46-84 yr). Mean renal tumour diameter was 2.75 cm (range: 1.3-4.2 cm). MW antennas were applied one to three times depending on tumour volume, location, and shape. After MW thermoablation, laparoscopic enucleation was performed to evaluate the histopathologic and haemostatic effects of MW. The mean MW antenna application time was 14.1 min (range: 4-30 min). Enucleation did not require renal pedicle clamping in any of the cases because no significant bleeding took place. Preablation pathology revealed clear cell renal carcinoma of Fuhrman grade I-II in all cases. Postablation pathology showed extensive coagulative necrosis without skipped tumour areas. No intra- or postoperative complications were reported.

Recently, biological collagen matrixes have emerged as an alternative to the routinely used synthetic materials. MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospectively, we analyzed our initial experience of chest wall reconstruction on large defects using a cross-linked porcine dermal acellular collagen matrix mesh with a thickness of 1.5 mm. RESULTS Six sarcoma patients with a mean age of 46 (22-66) years underwent chest wall resections. Complete thoracic wall defects (mean area 149 cm2) ranged from 8 × 10 to 15 × 20 cm in size. In the majority of cases, only mobilized subcutaneous tissue and skin were used for soft-tissue coverage of the implanted porcine collagen matrix patches. Implantation and postoperative courses were uneventful in all patients. No local infections or wound healing problems occurred. The collagen material resulted in durable and good to excellent chest wall stability in clinical follow-ups, and on computed tomography scans spanning over 3.5 years. Histological examination showed integration, neovascularization, and long-term persistence of the collagen matrix on late reoperation of one patient. CONCLUSION Acellular porcine dermal collagen matrix is a feasible and reliable biological patch material for reconstruction of the thoracic wall. Excellent wound healing and long-term stability are achieved even in large defects or complete sternal replacements.","Schmidt, Joachim; Redwan, Bassam; Koesek, Volkan; Heitplatz, Barbara; Bedetti, Benedetta; Aebert, Hermann; Wiebe, Karsten",The Thoracic and cardiovascular surgeon,382,33

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of exposure to, the occurrence and perceived risks of, and the worry about, occupational hazards among emergency and hospital physicians in the time of COVID. MATERIAL AND METHODS Based on the review of occupational hazards in emergency physicians, a questionnaire already used and validated in another study, conducted in 2016, was constructed. The questionnaire consisted of both socio-demographic questions and questions regarding the exposure to, the occurrence and perceived risks of, and the worry about, the following occupational hazards: infectious diseases, COVID-19, physical hazards, violence at work, and stressful situations at work that can cause burnout. A total of 497 questionnaires were distributed to Belgian emergency and hospital physicians in April 20-May 26, 2020. RESULTS Overall, 319 responses (out of 497 questionnaires) were collected, of which 196 were eligible for statistical analysis. Of the respondents, 32% stated to be confronted with violence and 54% to suffer from health problems related to their work. The exposure to, and the occurrence and perceived risks of, occupational hazards and, more specifically, the exposure to COVID-19 (88%) and its occurrence (10%), and also the worry about these hazards, appear to be high in physicians working in the emergency department. The worry about each of these outcomes is predicted by the supposed exposure, occurrence, and perceived risks. CONCLUSIONS The exposure to, and the occurrence and perceived risks of, physical hazards, violence and burnout are generally high in physicians in the time of COVID-19.

Identification of genes contributing to EEG variability during anaesthesia is important to the clinical application of anaesthesia monitoring and may provide an avenue to identify molecular mechanisms underlying the generation and regulation of brain oscillations. Central immune signalling can impact neuronal activity in the brain and accumulating evidence suggests an important role for cytokines as neuronal modulators. We tested 21 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in immune-related genes for associations with three anaesthesia-induced EEG patterns; spindle amplitude, delta power and alpha power, during general anaesthesia with desflurane in 111 patients undergoing general, gynaecological or orthopaedic surgery. Wide inter-patient variability was observed for all EEG variables. MYD88 rs6853 (p = 6.7 × 10(-4)) and IL-1β rs1143627 in conjunction with rs6853 (p = 1.5 × 10(-3)) were associated with spindle amplitude, and IL-10 rs1800896 was associated with delta power (p = 1.3 × 10(-2)) suggesting involvement of cytokine signalling in modulation of EEG patterns during desflurane anaesthesia. BDNF rs6265 was associated with alpha power (p = 3.9 × 10(-3)), suggesting differences in neuronal plasticity might also influence EEG patterns during desflurane anaesthesia. This is the first study we are aware of that has investigated genetic polymorphisms that may influence the EEG during general anaesthesia.","Mulholland, Claire Vignette; Somogyi, Andrew Alexander; Barratt, Daniel Thomas; Coller, Janet Kristie; Hutchinson, Mark Rowland; Jacobson, Gregory Michael; Cursons, Raymond Thomas; Sleigh, James Wallace",Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,382,1

Patients with AF and previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) have a high risk of stroke. We therefore aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of apixaban compared with warfarin in prespecified subgroups of patients with and without previous stroke or TIA. METHODS Between Dec 19, 2006, and April 2, 2010, patients were enrolled in the ARISTOTLE trial at 1034 clinical sites in 39 countries. 18,201 patients with AF or atrial flutter were randomly assigned to receive apixaban 5 mg twice daily or warfarin (target international normalised ratio 2·0-3·0). The median duration of follow-up was 1·8 years (IQR 1·4-2·3). The primary efficacy outcome was stroke or systemic embolism, analysed by intention to treat. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding in the on-treatment population. All participants, investigators, and sponsors were masked to treatment assignments. In this subgroup analysis, we estimated event rates and used Cox models to compare outcomes in patients with and without previous stroke or TIA. The ARISTOTLE trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NTC00412984. FINDINGS Of the trial population, 3436 (19%) had a previous stroke or TIA. In the subgroup of patients with previous stroke or TIA, the rate of stroke or systemic embolism was 2·46 per 100 patient-years of follow-up in the apixaban group and 3·24 in the warfarin group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·76, 95% CI 0·56 to 1·03); in the subgroup of patients without previous stroke or TIA, the rate of stroke or systemic embolism was 1·01 per 100 patient-years of follow-up with apixaban and 1·23 with warfarin (HR 0·82, 95% CI 0·65 to 1·03; p for interaction=0·71). The absolute reduction in the rate of stroke and systemic embolism with apixaban versus warfarin was 0·77 per 100 patient-years of follow-up (95% CI -0·08 to 1·63) in patients with and 0·22 (-0·03 to 0·47) in those without previous stroke or TIA.

Herein, we have expanded on this study by investigating the role of three of the plants, Pithecellobium dulce (Fabaceae), Leonotis nepetifolia (Lamiaceae), and Opuntia ficus-indica (Cactaceae), on the survival, fecundity, and egg viability of the dengue vector Aedes aegypti. METHODS We tested these effects using females that received (i) an initial three rations of blood meals and (ii) no blood meal at all. Two controls were included: age-matched females fed on glucose solution with or without an initial blood meal and those fed exclusively on blood meals. Data were collected daily over a 30-day period. The amino acid contents of Ae. aegypti guts and their respective diets were detected by coupled liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS Females fed on P. dulce and an exclusively blood meal diet had a shorter survival than those fed on glucose. On the other hand, females fed on L. nepetifolia survived longer than those fed exclusively on blood meals, whereas those fed on O. ficus-indica had the shortest survival time. With an initial blood meal, females fed on L. nepetifolia laid 1.6-fold more eggs while those fed on the other diets laid fewer eggs compared to those fed exclusively on blood meals. Hatching rates of the eggs laid varied with the diet. Mass spectroscopic analysis of gut contents of mosquitoes exposed to the different diets showed qualitative and quantitative differences in their amino acid levels. CONCLUSION Our findings highlight the central role of plant nutrients in the reproductive fitness of dengue vectors, which may impact their disease transmission potential.","Nyasembe, Vincent Odhiambo; Tchouassi, David Poumo; Muturi, Martha Njeri; Pirk, Christian W W; Sole, Catherine L; Torto, Baldwyn",Parasites & vectors,382,11

Histological, ultrastructural, and molecular analyses have revealed that scale insects differ in the type of symbionts, the localization of symbionts in the host body, and the mode of transmission of symbionts from one generation to the next. Symbiotic microorganisms may be distributed in the cells of the fat body, midgut epithelium, inside the cells of other symbionts, or the specialized cells of a mesodermal origin, termed bacteriocytes.

In the proposed model of respiratory failure, SARS-CoV down-regulates its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), but the mechanism involved is unknown. We found that the spike protein of SARS-CoV (SARS-S) induced TNF-alpha-converting enzyme (TACE)-dependent shedding of the ACE2 ectodomain. The modulation of TACE activity by SARS-S depended on the cytoplasmic domain of ACE2, because deletion mutants of ACE2 lacking the carboxyl-terminal region did not induce ACE2 shedding or TNF-alpha production. In contrast, the spike protein of HNL63-CoV (NL63-S), a CoV that uses ACE2 as a receptor and mainly induces the common cold, caused neither of these cellular responses. Intriguingly, viral infection, judged by real-time RT-PCR analysis of SARS-CoV mRNA expression, was significantly attenuated by deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of ACE2 or knock-down of TACE expression by siRNA. These data suggest that cellular signals triggered by the interaction of SARS-CoV with ACE2 are positively involved in viral entry but lead to tissue damage. These findings may lead to the development of anti-SARS-CoV agents.","Haga, Shiori; Yamamoto, Norio; Nakai-Murakami, Chikako; Osawa, Yoshiaki; Tokunaga, Kenzo; Sata, Tetsutaro; Yamamoto, Naoki; Sasazuki, Takehiko; Ishizaka, Yukihito",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,382,1

METHODS We searched Medline and Embase for manuscripts published between January 1946 and October 2016. Two reviewers independently selected manuscripts describing clinical research on stem cells, tissues, or solid organ transplantation with ≥20 participants, which mentioned ""sex"" and/or ""gender"" in the title or abstract. For each eligible manuscript, 2 of 5 reviewers extracted data on study design, population (transplant candidates, recipients, donors), transplant type, and study outcomes. We evaluated whether the terms ""sex"" and ""gender"" were applied according to their correct definitions and how these variables were handled at the level of study design and analysis. RESULTS Of 7565 search results, 2107 manuscripts met the inclusion criteria. Sex and gender were applied interchangeably in more than half of the studies (57.5%). Rarely were sex or gender, when applied correctly, considered in the primary study question (13.3% and 25.0%, respectively). The majority of the studies considered these variables as confounders (74.6% for sex and 68.2% for gender), and a minority considered them as effect measure modifiers (2.8% for sex and 5.0% for gender). CONCLUSIONS Despite a growing awareness of the need to integrate sex and gender in health research, education is required to ensure accurate and meaningful consideration of these concepts. We outline strategies for integrating sex and gender in allotransplantation and donation research during study design and analysis.","Laprise, Claudie; Cole, Katherine; Sridhar, Vikas Srinivasan; Marenah, Tida; Crimi, Cassandra; West, Lori; Foster, Bethany J; Pilote, Louise; Sapir-Pichhadze, Ruth",Transplantation,382,1

We previously reported that injection of endothelin-1 (ET-1) into one rat hindpaw induces prolonged mechanical and chemical sensitization of the contralateral hindpaw. Here, we examined the role of contralateral efferent activity in this process. METHODS ET-1 (2 nmol, 10 μL) was injected subcutaneously into the plantar surface of right (ipsilateral) hindpaw (ILP), and the thermal response latency and mechanical threshold for nocifensive withdrawal were determined by the use of, respectively, plantar radiant heating and von Frey filaments, for both ILP and contralateral hindpaws (CLP). Either paw was anesthetized for 60 minutes by direct injection of bupivacaine (0.25%, 40 μL), 30 minutes before ET-1. Alternatively, the contralateral sciatic nerve was blocked for 6 to 12 hours by percutaneous injection of bupivacaine-releasing microspheres 30 minutes before injection of ET-1. Systemic actions of these bupivacaine formulations were simulated by subcutaneous injection at the nuchal midline. RESULTS After the injection of ET-1, the mechanical threshold of both ILP and CLP decreased by 2 hours, appeared to be lowest around 24 hours, and recovered through 48 hours to preinjection baseline at 72 hours. These hypersensitive responses were suppressed by bupivacaine injected into the ipsilateral paw before ET-1. Injection of the CLP by bupivacaine also suppressed the hypersensitivity of the CLP at all test times, and that of the ILP, except at 2 hours when it increased the sensitivity. This same pattern of change occurred when the contralateral sciatic nerve was blocked by bupivacaine-releasing microspheres. The systemic actions of these bupivacaine formulations were much smaller and only reached significance at 24 hours post-ET-1. Thermal hypersensitivity after ET-1 injection also occurred in both ILP and CLP and showed the same pattern in response to the 2 contralateral anesthetic procedures. CONCLUSIONS These results show that efferent transmission through the contralateral innervation into the paw is necessary for contralateral sensitization by ET-1, suggesting that the release of substances by distal nerve endings is involved. The release of substances in the periphery is essential for contralateral sensitization by ET-1 and may also contribute to secondary hyperalgesia, occurring at loci distant from the primary injury, that occurs after surgery or nerve damage.","Strichartz, Gary R; Khodorova, Alla; Wang, Jeffrey Chi-Fei; Chen, Yu-Wen; Huang, Chuan-Chin",Anesthesia and analgesia,382,16

Staged excision with circumferential margin control (SECMC) has the potential to achieve low recurrence rates. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the clinical outcomes of SECMC using permanent, paraffin-embedded sections and delayed reconstruction. METHODS We conducted a retrospective, uncontrolled, observational cohort study involving patients who underwent staged excision for LM of the head and neck at Women's College Hospital in Toronto, Canada, from September 2010 to March 2013. Recurrence and infection rates were ascertained from patient charts and postal surveys. RESULTS One hundred and two patients (45 female, 57 male) were included with a median follow-up time of 1410.5 (IQR 260-1756) days. The median age was 69 (IQR 61-79) years. Approximately one-fifth (21%, 21/102) of patients required greater than 0.5 cm margins to achieve histological clearance. One patient (1/102) upstaged to invasive melanoma based on the initial stage of excision. The infection rate was 6% (6/102) and the 5-year cumulative recurrence rate was 1.4% (95% CI 0.2-9.6%). CONCLUSION SECMC using permanent sections and delayed reconstruction appears to be a safe and effective treatment method for LM on the head and neck. Randomized trials are needed to help define the optimal treatment.","Liu, Annie; Botkin, Alexis; Murray, Christian; Solish, Nowell; Kitchen, Jessica; Chan, An-Wen",Journal of cutaneous medicine and surgery,382,28

This review summarizes the currently immunological and clinical studies to provide a systemic overview of the epithelial-endothelial barrier, given the recently published immunological profiles upon viral pneumonia, and the potentially detrimental contribution to respiratory function caused by damage to this barrier.Expert opinionThe biophysical structure of host pulmonary defence is intrinsically linked with the ability of alveolar epithelial and capillary endothelial cells, known as the epithelial-endothelial barrier, to respond to, and instruct the delicate immune system to protect the lungs from infections and injuries. Recently published immunological profiles upon viral infection, and its contributions to the damage of respiratory function, suggest a central role for the pulmonary epithelial and endothelial barrier in the pathogenesis of ARDS. We suggest a central role and common pathways by which the epithelial-endothelial barrier contributes to the pathogenesis of ARDS.","Feng, Jun; Liu, Lina; He, Yang; Wang, Min; Zhou, Daixing; Wang, Junshuai",Expert review of clinical immunology,382,8

This article reviews the literature on adhesins of biothreat agents, their interactions with oligosaccharides and the potential for anti-adhesion compounds as an alternative to conventional therapeutics. The minimal binding structure of ricin has been well characterised and offers the best candidate for successful anti-adhesion therapy based on the Galβ1-4GlcNAc structure. The botulinum toxin serotypes A-F bind to a low number of gangliosides (GT1b, GQ1b, GD1a and GD1b) hence it should be possible to determine the minimal structure for binding. The minimal disaccharide sequence of GalNAcβ1-4Gal found in the gangliosides asialo-GM1 and asialo-GM2 is required for adhesion for many respiratory pathogens. Although a number of adhesins have been identified in bacterial biothreat agents such as Yersinia pestis, Bacillus anthracis, Francisella tularensis, Brucella species and Burkholderia pseudomallei, specific information regarding their in vivo expression during pneumonic infection is lacking. Limited oligosaccharide inhibition studies indicate the potential of GalNAcβ1-4Gal, GalNAcβ-3Gal and the hydrophobic compound, para-nitrophenol as starting points for the rational design of generic anti-adhesion compounds. A cocktail of multivalent oligosaccharides based on the minimal binding structures of identified adhesins would offer the best candidates for anti-adhesion therapy.","Thomas, Richard J",Bioengineered bugs,382,11

Daily huddles-discussions to identify and respond to safety risks-have been credited with enhancing safety culture in operationally complex industries including aviation and nuclear power. More recently, huddles have been endorsed as a mechanism to improve patient safety in healthcare. This review synthesises the literature related to the impact of hospital-based safety huddles. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature related to scheduled, multidisciplinary, hospital-based safety huddles through December 2019. We screened for studies (1) in which huddles were the primary intervention being assessed and (2) that measured the huddle programme's apparent impact using at least one quantitative metric. RESULTS We identified 1034 articles; 24 met our criteria for review, of which 19 reflected unit-based huddles and 5 reflected hospital-wide or multiunit huddles. Of the 24 included articles, uncontrolled pre-post comparison was the prevailing study design; we identified only two controlled studies. Among the 12 unit-based studies that provided complete measures of statistical significance for reported outcomes, 11 reported statistically significant improvement among some or all outcomes. The objectives of huddle programmes and the language used to describe them varied widely across the studies we reviewed. CONCLUSION While anecdotal accounts of successful huddle programmes abound and the evidence we reviewed appears favourable overall, high-quality peer-reviewed evidence regarding the effectiveness of hospital-based safety huddles, particularly at the hospital-wide level, is in its earliest stages. Additional rigorous research-especially focused on huddle programme design and implementation fidelity-would enhance the collective understanding of how huddles impact patient safety and other targeted outcomes. We propose a taxonomy and standardised reporting measures for future huddle-related studies to enhance comparability and evidence quality.","Franklin, Brian J; Gandhi, Tejal K; Bates, David W; Huancahuari, Nadia; Morris, Charles A; Pearson, Madelyn; Bass, Michelle Beth; Goralnick, Eric",BMJ quality & safety,382,0

In this study, we assessed the effects of N and P (high vs. low doses) on the abundance and structure of N2-fixation communities after wheat and soybean harvest in a long-term (34 and 35 years) fertilization experiment. In both seasons, long-term N addition significantly decreased the abundance of nifH genes and 16S rDNA; in addition, high doses of N and P fertilizer decreased the richness of diazotrophs, whereas low doses did not. The proportion of the dominant genus, Bradyrhizobium, in the soybean season (86.0%) was higher than that in the wheat season (47.9%). Fertilization decreased diazotroph diversity and the relative abundance of Bradyrhizobium in the wheat season, but had insignificant effects in the soybean season. The addition of N, but not P, significantly changed the communities of both diazotrophs (at the genus level) and rhizobia (at the species level) in the two seasons. Soil pH was positively associated with nifH abundance and diazotrophic richness; soil NO3- content was negatively correlated with diazotrophic richness and positively correlated with diversity. Soil pH and NO3- content were the two main drivers shaping the soil diazotrophic community. Overall, long-term inorganic N had a greater influence than P on both diazotrophic abundance and community composition, and diazotrophic diversity was more clearly affected by fertilization in the wheat season than in the soybean season.","Zhou, Jing; Ma, Mingchao; Guan, Dawei; Jiang, Xin; Zhang, Nianxin; Shu, Fengyue; Kong, Yong; Li, Jun",Scientific reports,382,20

For initial-onset VKH disease, it is increasingly thought that corticosteroid therapy is not sufficient and additional non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapy is needed. At the 11th workshop on VKH, the disease was said to be well controlled with corticosteroids alone in Japanese patients. The aim of this study was to review the literature to determine whether different levels of severity exist in different geographical areas. METHODS Literature was reviewed for studies on the evolution of initial-onset VKH disease, looking at treatment modalities and proportion of cases with chronic evolution and/or sunset-glow fundus (SGF). RESULTS PubMed search yielded 1249 references containing the term of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada. Twenty references (15 from outside of Japan and 5 from Japan) contained information on the evolution of treated initial-onset disease. For the ""international"" group, percentage of chronic evolution after systemic corticosteroid monotherapy was 61%, and after combined steroidal and non-steroidal therapy it fell to 2% (0% in 3/4 studies). In the Japanese studies where all patients received systemic corticosteroids alone, chronic evolution was reported in 25%; however, SGF amounted to 61%. CONCLUSION In the world at large, chronic evolution of initial-onset VKH disease treated with corticosteroids alone concerned two-thirds of patients. Japanese studies showed that chronic evolution was substantially less frequent, indicating possibly less severe disease in Japan. This proportion fell to almost zero when dual steroidal and non-steroidal immunosuppression was given at onset.","Herbort, Carl P; Tugal-Tutkun, Ilknur; Khairallah, Moncef; Abu El Asrar, Ahmed M; Pavésio, Carlos E; Soheilian, Masoud",International ophthalmology,382,31

SARS-CoV-2 has a wide tropism and detection of the virus has been described in multiple specimen types, including various respiratory secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, and stool. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the accuracy and sensitivity of a laboratory modified CDCbased SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2 assay across a range of sample types. Study Design We compared the matrix effect on the analytical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection by qRT-PCR in nasal swabs collected in viral transport medium (VTM), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), sputum, plasma, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), stool, VTM, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). Initial limits of detection (LoD) were subsequently narrowed to confirm an LoD for each specimen type and target gene. RESULTS LoDs were established using a modified CDC-based laboratory developed test and ranged from a mean CT cut-off of 33.8-35.7 (10-20 copies/reaction) for the N1 gene target, and 34.0-36.2 (1-10 copies/reaction) for N2. Alternatives to VTM such as PBS and HBSS had comparable LoDs. The N2 gene target was found to be most sensitive in CSF.

Predictors of stricture formation have not been well studied. METHODS We conducted a retrospective, observational, descriptive study by using a prospective endoscopic mucosal resection database in a tertiary referral center. For each patient, we extracted the age, sex, lesion size, use of ablative therapy, and detection of esophageal strictures. The primary outcome was the presence of esophageal stricture at follow-up. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the association between the primary outcome and predictors. RESULTS Of 136 patients, 27% (n=37) had esophageal strictures. Thirty-two percent (n=44) needed endoscopic dilation to relieve dysphagia (median, 2; range, 1 to 8). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the size of the lesion excised is associated with increased odds of having a stricture (odds ratio, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 2.3; p=0.01), when controlling for age, sex, and ablative modalities. Similarly, the number of lesions removed in the index procedure was associated with increased odds of developing a stricture (odds ratio, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 4.2; p=0.007). CONCLUSIONS Stricture formation after esophageal endoscopic mucosal resection is common. Risk factors for stricture formation include large mucosal resections and the resection of multiple lesions on the initial procedure.","Qumseya, Bashar; Panossian, Abraham M; Rizk, Cynthia; Cangemi, David; Wolfsen, Christianne; Raimondo, Massimo; Woodward, Timothy; Wallace, Michael B; Wolfsen, Herbert",Clinical endoscopy,382,1

Until now, abstract models for describing the structural logic of studies in environmental sciences are lacking and tools for data management are insufficient. Mandatory for repeatability and reproducibility is the use of sophisticated data management solutions going beyond data file sharing. Particularly, it implies maintenance of coherent data along workflows. Design data concern elements from elementary domains of operations being transformation, measurement and transaction. Operation design elements and method information are specified for each consecutive workflow segment from field to laboratory campaigns. The strict linkage of operation design element values, operation values and objects is essential. For enabling coherence of corresponding objects along consecutive workflow segments, the assignment of unique identifiers and the specification of their relations are mandatory. The abstract model presented here addresses these aspects, and the software DiversityDescriptions (DWB-DD) facilitates the management of thusly connected digital data objects and structures. DWB-DD allows for an individual specification of operation design elements and their linking to objects. Two workflow design use cases, one for DNA barcoding and another for cultivation of fungal isolates, are given. To publish those structured data, standard schema mapping and XML-provision of digital objects are essential. Schemas useful for this mapping include the Ecological Markup Language, the Schema for Meta-omics Data of Collection Objects and the Standard for Structured Descriptive Data. Data pipelines with DWB-DD include the mapping and conversion between schemas and functions for data publishing and archiving according to the Open Archival Information System standard. The setting allows for repeatability of study setups, reproducibility of study results and for supporting work groups to structure and maintain their data from the beginning of a study.

In the United Kingdom, one service that has benefitted from this response is the provision of early medical abortion. England, Wales, and Scotland have all issued approval orders to this effect. These orders allow women to terminate pregnancies up to certain gestational limits, removing the need for them to contravene social distancing measures to access care. However, they are intended only as temporary measures for the duration of the pandemic response. In this paper, we chart these developments and further demonstrate the already acknowledged politicisation of abortion care. We focus on two key elements of the orders: (1) the addition of updated clinical guidance in the Scottish order that suggests an extended gestational limit, and (2) sunset clauses in the English and Welsh orders, as well as an indication of similar intentions in Scotland. In discussing these two issues, we suggest that the refusal of UK governments to introduce telemedical provision of early medical abortion previously has not been based on health concerns. Further, we question whether it would be appropriate for the approval orders to be lifted following the pandemic, suggesting that to do so would represent regressive and harmful policy.","Parsons, Jordan A; Romanis, Elizabeth Chloe",Health policy,382,19

The genetic architecture of Lp(a) remains incompletely understood, as well as its independence of LDL cholesterol in its association to CAD. We investigated the genetic determinants of Lp(a) concentrations in a large prospective multiethnic cohort. We tested the association for potential causality between genetically determined higher Lp(a) concentrations and CAD using a multivariable Mendelian randomization strategy. Approach and Results: We studied 371 212 participants of the UK Biobank with available Lp(a) and genome-wide genetic data. Genome-wide association analyses confirmed 2 known and identified 37 novel loci (P<5×10-8) associated with Lp(a). Testing these loci as instrumental variables in an independent cohort with 60 801 cases and 123 504 controls, each SD genetically elevated Lp(a) conferred a 1.30 ([95% CI, 1.20-1.41] P=5.53×10-11) higher odds of CAD. Importantly, this association was independent of LDL cholesterol. Genetic fine-mapping in the LPA gene region identified 15 potential causal variants. This included a rare missense variant (rs41267813[A]) associated with lower Lp(a) concentration. We observed a strong interaction between rs41267813 and rs10455872 on Lp(a) concentrations, indicating a protective effect of rs41267813(A). CONCLUSIONS This study supports an LDL cholesterol-independent causal link between Lp(a) and CAD. A rare missense variant in the LPA gene locus appears to be protective in people with the Lp(a) increasing variant of rs10455872. In the search for therapeutic targets of Lp(a), future work should focus on understanding the functional consequences of this missense variant.","Said, M Abdullah; Yeung, Ming Wai; van de Vegte, Yordi J; Benjamins, Jan Walter; Dullaart, Robin P F; Ruotsalainen, Sanni; Ripatti, Samuli; Natarajan, Pradeep; Juarez-Orozco, Luis Eduardo; Verweij, Niek; van der Harst, P","Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",382,1

Therefore, there is a risk of the endoscope or surgical instruments physically damaging body tissues. To overcome this problem, we developed a Ø7- mm 3-D endoscope that can switch between providing front and front-diagonal view 3-D images by simply rotating its sleeves. METHODS This 3-D endoscope consists of a conventional 3-D endoscope and an outer and inner sleeve with a beam splitter and polarization plates. The beam splitter was used for visualizing both the front and front-diagonal view and was set at 25° to the outer sleeve's distal end in order to eliminate a blind spot common to both views. Polarization plates were used to avoid overlap of the two views. We measured signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), sharpness, chromatic aberration (CA), and viewing angle of this 3-D endoscope and evaluated its feasibility in vivo. RESULTS Compared to the conventional 3-D endoscope, SNR and sharpness of this 3-D endoscope decreased by 20 and 7 %, respectively. No significant difference was found in CA. The viewing angle for both the front and front-diagonal views was about 50°. In the in vivo experiment, this 3-D endoscope can provide clear 3-D images of both views by simply rotating its inner sleeve. CONCLUSIONS The developed 3-D endoscope can provide the front and front-diagonal view by simply rotating the inner sleeve, therefore the risk of damage to fragile body tissues can be significantly decreased.","Kamiuchi, Hiroki; Masamune, Ken; Kuwana, Kenta; Dohi, Takeyoshi; Kim, Keri; Yamashita, Hiromasa; Chiba, Toshio",International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery,382,1

BACKGROUND Migraine is a common, incapacitating neurological condition. Although chlorpromazine and prochlorperazine are known to be safe, efficacious treatments for migraine, they have never been directly compared. DESIGN We performed a prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial at a tertiary hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Adults aged 18-65 years, who presented with migraine, were eligible for recruitment. Sixty-six patients were randomized to either chlorpromazine 12.5 mg or prochlorperazine 12.5 mg, both infused in 500 ml of sodium chloride 0.9% over 30 min. Headache severity score, nausea severity score, and the presence of photophobia and phonophobia were assessed at 0, 30, 60, and 120 min. Adverse effects and the need for rescue therapy were recorded. The primary outcome was a reduction in headache severity score from baseline at 60 min post-commencement of the study medicine infusion. RESULTS Sixty-five patients were included in the analysis. There was a median reduction in headache severity score at 60 min of 3.0 (interquartile range 1.0-4.0) in the chlorpromazine arm versus 2.0 (1.0-4.0) in the prochlorperazine arm (median difference -0.5 (95% confidence interval, -1.9 to 0.9)). We saw no evidence of a difference in secondary outcomes at 30, 60, or 120 min. Side effects were reported in 16/32 (50%) patients in the chlorpromazine group versus 7/33 (21%) in the prochlorperazine group (p = 0.020). Rescue therapy was required in 12/33 (36%) patients in the chlorpromazine group versus 7/32 (22%) in the prochlorperazine group (p = 0.277). CONCLUSIONS Both chlorpromazine and prochlorperazine are efficacious treatments for acute migraine in adult patients presenting to the ED. This trial found no evidence of superiority of either agent over the other. Caution should be used when prescribing these medicines in the borderline hypotensive patient; in that circumstance, prochlorperazine should be preferentially used.","Hodgson, Sarah E; Harding, Andrew M; Bourke, Elyssia M; Taylor, David M; Greene, Shaun L",Headache,382,31

Locoregional therapies include ablation and hepatic artery therapies such as embolization and radioembolization. In this study we evaluate the feasibility of using novel antivascular ultrasound (AVUS) as a noninvasive locoregional therapy to reduce perfusion in HCC lesions in a rat model and, monitor the effect with contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging. Methods: HCC was induced in 36 Wistar rats by the ingestion of 0.01% diethylnitrosamine (DEN) for 12 weeks. Two therapy regimens of AVUS were evaluated. A primary regimen (n = 19) utilized 2-W/cm2, 3-MHz ultrasound (US) for 6 minutes insonation with 0.7 ml of microbubbles administered as an intravenous bolus. An alternate dose at half the primary intensity, sonication time, and contrast concentration was evaluated in 11 rats to assess the efficacy of a reduced dose. A control group (n = 6) received a sham therapy. Tumor perfusion was measured before and after AVUS with nonlinear contrast ultrasound (NLC) and power Doppler (PD). The quantitative perfusion measures included perfusion index (PI), peak enhancement (PE), time to peak (TTP), and perfusion area from NLC and PD scans. Total tumor area perfused during the scan was measured by a postprocessing algorithm called delta projection. Tumor histology was evaluated for signs of tissue injury and for vascular changes using CD31 immunohistochemistry. Results: DEN exposure induced autochthonous hepatocellular carcinoma lesions in all rats. Across all groups prior to therapy, there were no significant differences in the nonlinear contrast observations of peak enhancement and perfusion index. In the control group, there were no significant differences in any of the parameters after sham treatment. After the primary AVUS regimen, there were significant changes in all parameters (p ≤ 0.05) indicating substantial decreases in tumor perfusion. Peak enhancement in nonlinear contrast scans showed a 37.9% ± 10.1% decrease in tumor perfusion. Following reduced-dose AVUS, there were no significant changes in perfusion parameters, although there was a trend for the nonlinear contrast observations of peak enhancement and perfusion index to increase. Conclusion: This study translated low-intensity AVUS therapy into a realistic in vivo model of HCC and evaluated its effects on the tumor vasculature. The primary dose of AVUS tested resulted in significant vascular disruption and a corresponding reduction in tumor perfusion. A reduced dose of AVUS, on the other hand, was ineffective at disrupting perfusion but demonstrated the potential for enhancing tumor blood flow. Theranostic ultrasound, where acoustic energy and microbubbles are used to monitor the tumor neovasculature as well as disrupt the vasculature and treat lesions, could serve as a potent tool for delivering noninvasive, locoregional therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma.","D'Souza, Julia C; Sultan, Laith R; Hunt, Stephen J; Gade, Terence P; Karmacharya, Mrigendra B; Schultz, Susan M; Brice, Angela K; Wood, Andrew K W; Sehgal, Chandra M",Nanotheranostics,382,19

Diatom, invertebrate, and fish communities were enumerated, and five types of potential stressors were quantified: habitat disturbance, excess nutrients, high flows, basic water quality, and contaminants in water and sediment. Boosted regression tree (BRT) models for each biological assemblage and region generally included variables from all five stressor types and multiple stressors types in each model was the norm. Classification and regression tree (CART) models then were used to determine thresholds for each BRT model variable above which there appeared to be adverse effects (multi-metric index (MMI) models only). In every region and assemblage there was a significant inverse relation between the MMI and the number of stressors exerting potentially adverse effects. The number of elevated instream stressors often varied substantially for a given level of land-use development and the number of elevated stressors was a better predictor of biological condition than was development. Using the adverse effects-levels that were developed based on the BRT model results, 68% of the streams had two or more stressors with potentially adverse effects and 35% had four or more. Our results indicate that relatively small increases in the number of stressors of different types can have a large effect on a stream ecosystem.","Waite, Ian R; Van Metre, Peter C; Moran, Patrick W; Konrad, Chris P; Nowell, Lisa H; Meador, Mike R; Munn, Mark D; Schmidt, Travis S; Gellis, Allen C; Carlisle, Daren M; Bradley, Paul M; Mahler, Barbara J",The Science of the total environment,382,1

Proinflammatory innate and adaptive immune responses mediate virus clearance. In marked contrast, CCL2 Tg mice infected with rJ2.2 ineffectively cleared virus and rapidly succumbed to the infection. CCL2 Tg mice mounted a dysregulated immune response, characterized by augmented accumulation of regulatory Foxp3(+)CD4(+) T cells and of nitric-oxide- and YM-1-expressing macrophages and microglia, suggestive of mixed M1/M2 macrophage activation. Further, macrophages from infected CCL2 Tg brains relative to non-Tg controls were less activated/mature, expressing lower levels of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II), CD86, and CD40. Collectively, these results show that persistent CCL2 overexpression establishes and sustains an immunological milieu that is both inflammatory and immunosuppressive and predisposes mice to a defective immune response to a minimally lethal virus.","Trujillo, Jonathan A; Fleming, Erica L; Perlman, Stanley",Journal of virology,382,1

Therefore, I reviewed the literature on LPAIV infections in wild waterbirds. The virulence of LPAIV was assessed in 17 studies on experimental infections and nine studies on natural infections. Reported evidence for virulence were reductions in return rate, feeding rate, body weight, long-range movement and reproductive success, as well as pathological changes in infected organs. However, major caveats in studies of experimental infections were unnatural route of LPAIV inoculation, animal husbandry not simulating natural stressors and low sensitivity of clinical assessment. Major caveats in studies of natural infections were incomplete measurement of LPAIV infection burden, quasi-experimental design and potential misclassification of birds. After taking these caveats into account, the only remaining evidence for virulence was that presence and intensity of LPAIV infection were negatively correlated with body weight. Based on this correlation, together with the demonstrated LPAIV tropism for the intestinal tract, I hypothesize that LPAIV reduces digestive tract function, and suggest how future studies could be directed to test this hypothesis.","Kuiken, Thijs",Proceedings.

The direct contact between the tonometer and the eye may contribute to the risk of cross infection, especially of viral particles, from one patient to another. A systematic review was undertaken to address the likelihood of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and prion diseases transmission through the use of tonometers. Additionally, a comparison of the current tonometer disinfection methods is provided to assist with identifying which technique effectively reduces the risk of disease transmission. An electronic literature search was conducted using the following databases: Web of Science, EMBASE, CINAHL, SCOPUS, Biosis Previews, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Dissertation indexes were also searched, and these included: Dissertations and Abstracts, and Dissertations and Abstracts - UK/Ireland. Additionally, the Clinicaltrials.gov trial registry was searched to identify any other relevant literature. Two independent reviewers critically appraised the articles retrieved through the literature search. In total, 11 unique studies were deemed relevant for this systematic review. The available evidence demonstrated that the use of tonometers contributes to the transmission of these infectious diseases in vitro. The results also demonstrated variability in determining the most effective tonometer sterilization technique against these infectious diseases in vitro. There was limited evidence available regarding the transmission of HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and prion diseases through the use of tonometers. Additionally, due to the variability regarding the most effective sterilization techniques, it is difficult to identify which sterilization technique is most effective or adequately effective against these infectious diseases. Future research studies regarding infectious disease transmission through tonometry and sterilization techniques should be completed to more adequately inform infectious disease control guidelines.","Atkins, Nicole; Hodge, William; Li, Bruce",Journal of clinical medicine research,382,26

CPP is very common, but its pathophysiology is still controversial. Evaluation of pain sensitivity in painful and nonpainful areas is key to understanding the underlying peripheral vs. central contributions to the symptom. This in turn is fundamental to improving the treatment strategies. RECENT FINDINGS We reviewed the experimental studies published over the last year on pain thresholds to different stimuli measured at both the somatic and visceral level in women with different forms of recurrent or CPP. The majority of the studies indicate a pain threshold decrease to most stimuli in skin, subcutis and muscle in painful pelvic areas, the site of referred pain from pelvic viscera, as well as a decreased pain threshold in most viscera (colon and urinary bladder). A significant threshold decrease is also found in deep somatic tissues (subcutis and muscle) outside the painful zone in the most severe cases, indicating a state of central sensitization. SUMMARY These findings have important implications for clinical practice: pain threshold measurement in both painful and nonpainful sites could have important predictive value of the clinical evolution and response to therapy of CPP.","Giamberardino, Maria A; Tana, Claudio; Costantini, Raffaele",Current opinion in obstetrics & gynecology,382,1

This study aimed to compare a new titanium-coated lightweight mesh with a standard composite mesh after laparoscopic incisional hernia repair. METHODS A randomized controlled single-center clinical trial was designed using the basic principle of one unit, one surgeon, one technique (midline incisional hernia with a laparoscopic approach), and two meshes: a lightweight titanium-coated mesh (group 1) and a medium-weight collagen-polyester composite mesh (group 2) used in 102 patients. The primary end points were pain and recurrence. The secondary end points were morbidity and patient outcomes (analgesic consumption, return to everyday activities). RESULTS The postoperative complication rates were similar for the two meshes. Pain was significantly less common in group 1 than in group 2 at 1 month (P = 0.029) but was similar for the two groups at 6 months and 1 year. There was a significant difference between the two groups in the average use of analgesics: 6.1 days in group 1 versus 1.6 days in group 2 (P < 0.001). The lightweight group returned to everyday activities after 6.9 days versus 9.7 days for the composite group (P < 0.001). The rate of recurrence did not differ between the two groups at the 2-year follow-up evaluation. CONCLUSIONS The light titanium-covered polypropylene mesh was associated with less postoperative pain in the short term, lower analgesic consumption, and a quicker return to everyday activities than the Parietex composite medium-weight mesh. The recurrence rates at 2 years showed no difference between the two groups.","Moreno-Egea, Alfredo; Carrillo-Alcaraz, Andrés; Soria-Aledo, Víctor",Surgical endoscopy,382,1

The aim of this study was to describe ultrasound practice in the assessment of medical inpatients at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi, and evaluate uptake and impact of POCUS following the introduction of a training programme at the college of Medicine, Blantyre, Malawi. METHODS : A weekly prospective record review of sequential adult medical inpatients who had received an ultrasound examination was conducted. RESULTS Of 835 patients screened, 250 patients were included; 267 ultrasound examinations were performed, of which 133 (50%) were POCUS (defined as performed by a clinician at the bedside). The time from request to performance of examination was shorter for POCUS examinations than radiology department ultrasound (RDUS) (median 0 [IQR 0-2, range 0-11] vs 2 [IQR 1-4, range 0-15] d, p=0.002); 104/133 (78.2%) POCUS and 90/133 (67.7%) RDUS examinations were deemed to have an impact on management. CONCLUSION Following the introduction of a training programme in POCUS, half of all ultrasound examinations were delivered as POCUS. POCUS was performed rapidly and impacted on patient management.

In this study, we used the inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) and sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) markers to assess the level and pattern of genetic diversity in five domesticated T. sinensis populations in China. Our results indicated a relatively low level of genetic diversity both at species (Hs = 0.1662, 0.2098, respectively) and population levels (Hs = 0.0978, 0.1145, respectively). Molecular variance analyses revealed a relatively high degree of differentiation among populations (GST = 0.3901, 0.4498), and low levels of gene flow (Nm = 0.7816 and 0.6116). We divided the five populations into two groups by cluster analysis: group one consists of populations collected from the south part of China (e.g., Yuxi, Yunan Province and Zuanjiang, Chongqing Municipality), and group two contains those cultivated in north part of China (e.g., Hengshui, Hebei Province, Jinan and Rizhao, Shandong Province). The correlation of genetic relationships among populations fits well with their geographical distribution (Mantel test; r = 0.7236 and 0.6789, respectively). Asexual propagation, limited gene flow and geographic isolation are most likely the key factors associated with the observed genetic structure of T. sinensis grown in China.

However, making this diagnosis can be challenging, and over a third of patients referred to stroke prevention clinic are ultimately found to have alternate diagnoses. AIMS We performed a systematic review to determine how neurologists diagnose transient ischemic attack. SUMMARY OF REVIEW A systematic literature search was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines using MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases. Publications eligible for inclusion were those that included information on the demographic or clinical features neurologists use to diagnose transient ischemic attacks or transient ischemic attack-mimics. Of 1666 citations, 210 abstracts were selected for full-text screening and 80 publications were ultimately deemed eligible for inclusion. Neurologists were more likely to diagnose transient ischemic attack based on clinical features including negative symptoms or speech deficits. Patients with positive symptoms, altered level of consciousness, or the presence of nonfocal symptoms such as confusion or amnesia were more likely to be diagnosed with transient ischemic attack-mimic. Neurologists commonly include mode of onset (i.e. sudden versus gradual), recurrence of attacks, and localizability of symptoms to a distinct vascular territory in the diagnostic decision-making process. Transient ischemic attack diagnosis was more commonly associated with advanced age, preexisting hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and other vascular risk factors. CONCLUSIONS Neurologists rely on certain clinical and demographic features to distinguish transient ischemic attacks from mimics, which are not currently reflected in widely used risk scores. Clarifying how neurologists diagnose transient ischemic attack may help frontline clinicians to better select patients for referral to stroke prevention clinics.","Fitzpatrick, Tess; Gocan, Sophia; Wang, Chu Q; Hamel, Candyce; Bourgoin, Aline; Dowlatshahi, Dar; Stotts, Grant; Shamy, Michel",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,382,9

National reporting does not include gender identity; therefore, data are absent on the impact of COVID-19 on transgender people, including those with HIV. Baseline data from the American Cohort to Study HIV Acquisition Among Transgender Women in High Risk Areas (LITE) Study provide an opportunity to examine pre-COVID factors that may increase vulnerability to COVID-19-related harms among transgender women. SETTING Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Miami, New York City, Washington, DC. METHODS Baseline data from LITE were analyzed for demographic, psychosocial, and material factors that may affect vulnerability to COVID-related harms. RESULTS The 1020 participants had high rates of poverty, unemployment, food insecurity, homelessness, and sex work. Transgender women with HIV (n = 273) were older, more likely to be Black, had lower educational attainment, and were more likely to experience material hardship. Mental and behavioral health symptoms were common and did not differ by HIV status. Barriers to health care included being mistreated, provider discomfort serving transgender women, and past negative experiences; as well as material hardships, such as cost and transportation. However, most reported access to material and social support-demonstrating resilience. CONCLUSIONS Transgender women with HIV may be particularly vulnerable to pandemic harms. Mitigating this harm would benefit everyone, given the highly infectious nature of this coronavirus. Collecting gender identity in COVID-19 data is crucial to inform an effective public health response. Transgender-led organizations' response to this crisis serve as an important model for effective community-led interventions.","Poteat, Tonia C; Reisner, Sari L; Miller, Marissa; Wirtz, Andrea L",Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes,382,24

When the carrier can highly disperse the drug, it will increase the wettability of the drug and reduce the surface tension, thus improving the solubility, dissolution, and bioavailability. However, amorphous solid dispersions usually have low drug loading and poor stability. Therefore, the goal of this work is to study the increased dissolution and high stability of high drug-loading crystalline solid dispersion (CSD), and the difference in dissolution and stability of high-loading and low-loading amorphous solid dispersion (ASD). A CSD of nimodipine with a drug loading of 90% was prepared by wet milling, with hydroxypropyl cellulose (model: HPC-SL) and sodium dodecyl sulfate as stabilizers and spray drying. At the same time, the gradient drug-loaded ASD was prepared by hot melt extrusion with HPC-SL as the carrier. Each preparation was characterized by DSC, PXRD, FT-IR, SEM, and in vitro dissolution testing. The results indicated that the drug in CSD existed in a crystalline state. The amorphous drug molecules in the low drug-loading ASD were uniformly dispersed in the carrier, while the drug state in the high drug-loading ASD was aggregates of the amorphous drug.

AIM To assess the effectiveness of existing sterilization techniques for NOTES by quantifying and speciating colony-forming units (CFUs) before and after treatment. DESIGN Ex vivo animal studies; bacteriological study. METHODS Stomachs and distal colons were harvested en bloc from ten fasted adult white pigs following euthanasia. Half received cefazolin 1 g intravenously prior to killing. Multiple tissue samples were obtained from each resected organ. Each tissue sample was then assigned to one of five treatment arms: (1) normal saline, (2) Betadine, (3) cefazolin/metronidazole suspension, (4) chlorhexidine, (5) no treatment. Fifteen samples were used per arm. After treatment, the mucosal surface of each sample was swabbed and inoculated in normal saline, followed by serial dilutions, which were then plated onto sheep's blood agar plates and incubated under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. CFUs were quantified and speciated. RESULTS Median bacterial density was estimated to be 8.0 × 10(5) CFUs/ml (stomach) and 1.9 × 10(6) CFUs/ml (colon). The predominant organisms were Escherichia coli (stomach) and both E. coli and Enterococcus sp. (colon). Saline and antibiotic suspension lavages caused a 1-log reduction in stomach and colon. Betadine/chlorhexidine lavage resulted in a 4-log reduction. Intravenous antibiotics alone resulted in a 4-log reduction. Combining intravenous antibiotics and either Betadine or chlorhexidine decreased counts to the 10(1) level. By Kruskal-Wallis method, differences were statistically significant (p = 0.001).

The optimal selection of interventions targeting the virus is unknown. Therefore, evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to support specific treatment against COVID-19 is urgently needed. The use of Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) might have a role in the treatment and symptomatic management of patients with COVID-19. It was aimed at providing an overview of the available evidence and ongoing trials concerning the effects of CHMs for the treatment of COVID-19. Methods: This is a narrative review of relevant studies. Searches were conducted to identify documents published till April 22, 2020. Electronic databases, evidence-based collections, websites of relevant organizations, and trial registries were consulted. Results: A total of 25 guidelines on the treatment of patients with COVID-19 were identified. Four guidelines provided recommendations on the use of CHMs; these guidelines were developed in China and South Korea and were based on the consensus of experts exclusively. The remaining 21 guidelines provided no guidance on CHMs. No finished RCTs of CHMs for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 was found. According to the evidence evaluated in this review, a Cochrane review of CHMs for severe acute respiratory syndrome and five uncontrolled observational studies of the effects of CHMs in patients with COVID-19, the effects of CHMs for COVID-19 are unknown. A total of 52 ongoing clinical trials of CHM interventions for the treatment of COVID-19 were found. These trials will be carried out mostly in China (n = 51). Forty (77%) of the ongoing trials will be randomized, whereas 12 (23%) have an unclear sequence generation procedure. Forty-seven trials (90%) will have a sample size <400 participants. Conclusions: To the authors' knowledge, only the Chinese and the South Korean guidelines recommend CHMs as a treatment option for patients with COVID-19. These guidelines base their recommendations on the consensus of experts. Clinical guidelines or health authorities from other countries do not provide advice on CHMs. Due to the absence of RCT, there is currently no reliable evidence on the effects of any specific CHM intervention for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.

RNase L activity depends on 2-5A, synthesized by OAS. Although all three enzymatically active OAS proteins in humans--OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3--synthesize 2-5A upon binding dsRNA, it is unclear which are responsible for RNase L activation during viral infection. We used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease (Cas9) technology to engineer human A549-derived cell lines in which each of the OAS genes or RNase L is knocked out. Upon transfection with poly(rI):poly(rC), a synthetic surrogate for viral dsRNA, or infection with each of four viruses from different groups (West Nile virus, Sindbis virus, influenza virus, or vaccinia virus), OAS1-KO and OAS2-KO cells synthesized amounts of 2-5A similar to those synthesized in parental wild-type cells, causing RNase L activation as assessed by rRNA degradation. In contrast, OAS3-KO cells synthesized minimal 2-5A, and rRNA remained intact, similar to infected RNase L-KO cells. All four viruses replicated to higher titers in OAS3-KO or RNase L-KO A549 cells than in parental, OAS1-KO, or OAS2-KO cells, demonstrating the antiviral effects of OAS3. OAS3 displayed a higher affinity for dsRNA in intact cells than either OAS1 or OAS2, consistent with its dominant role in RNase L activation. Finally, the requirement for OAS3 as the major OAS isoform responsible for RNase L activation was not restricted to A549 cells, because OAS3-KO cells derived from two other human cell lines also were deficient in RNase L activation.","Li, Yize; Banerjee, Shuvojit; Wang, Yuyan; Goldstein, Stephen A; Dong, Beihua; Gaughan, Christina; Silverman, Robert H; Weiss, Susan R",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,382,1

In most cases, the bleeding will be self-limited, resolving after discontinuation of anticoagulation for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis. Occasionally, however, bleeding can be problematic, resulting in significant postoperative morbidity or even mortality. The purpose of the present study was to review cases of early postoperative gastrointestinal bleeding after gastric bypass to identify possible risk factors and examine outcomes. METHODS A prospective weight loss surgery patient database was reviewed to examine the cases occurring from January 2005 to July 2008. Patients with early postoperative bleeding were identified. The demographics and co-morbidities were compared between those with and without postoperative bleeding. The outcomes of interest included the transfusion requirement, postoperative morbidity, need for reoperation, length of hospital stay, intensive care unit admission, and 30-day mortality. RESULTS A total of 776 patients had undergone gastric bypass during the study period. Of these, 26 (3.3%) were identified with early postoperative bleeding.

Of the patients with early postoperative bleeding, the most common presenting sign or symptom was tachycardia (46%) followed by melena (32%) and hematemesis (18%). The transfusion requirement range was 0-11 U (average 3.2 U/patient). Of the 26 patients, 4 (15%) required intensive care unit admission and 8 (31%) required reoperation. Four gastrointestinal leaks, one stomal ulceration, and one gastrogastric fistula were identified in the early postoperative bleeding group. One patient (3.8%) in the early postoperative bleeding group died. Compared with nonbleeding patients, those with early postoperative bleeding had a significantly longer hospital stay (4.8 versus 3, P <.0001) and greater mortality rate (7.1% versus .9%, P <.01). CONCLUSION Postoperative bleeding is a significant complication after gastric bypass surgery. Although in many cases, the bleeding will be self-limited, it can result in additional notable complications. In the present study, postoperative bleeding contributed to significantly longer hospital stays and resulted in 1 death. A patient with bleeding after gastric bypass should raise due concern, with attention to the potential attendant complications.","Dick, Amanda; Byrne, T Karl; Baker, Megan; Budak, Amanda; Morgan, Katherine",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,382,1

Most data available on flow diversion reflect highly focused patient groups and very experienced operators. We evaluated a national, multihospital patient database to examine periprocedural morbidity and mortality in patients treated with endovascular flow diversion therapy. The Premier Perspective database was used to identify patients hospitalized between May 2011 and March 2013 for unruptured aneurysm who underwent flow diversion therapy with a Pipeline embolization device. The risk of in-hospital mortality and morbidity was determined using ICD 9 codes. A total of 279 unruptured aneurysm patients at 18 medical centers underwent endovascular therapy with a Pipeline device. Adverse outcomes included in-hospital mortality in two cases (0.7%), discharge to long-term care in 22 cases (7.9%), ischemic complications in 14 cases (5.0%), hemorrhagic complications in four cases (1.4%), and postoperative neurological complications in nine cases (3.2%). This study of a large cohort of patient hospitalizations in the United States provides preliminary data on flow diversion in a ""real world"" scenario and demonstrates that the periprocedural morbidity and mortality is not negligible and must be considered in the context of the natural history of the aneurysms that are being treated.","McDonald, Robert J; McDonald, Jennifer S; Kallmes, David F; Lanzino, Giuseppe; Cloft, Harry J","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",382,33

Preventing adhesions could reduce the risk of complications during revision surgery, and possibly reduce the need for revision procedures. This study evaluates the ability of DuraSeal Xact Adhesion Barrier System (DSX) (Covidien, Mansfield, Massachusetts) and Oxiplex/SP gel (OX) (FzioMed, San Luis Obispo, California) to affect the extent and severity of postoperative perivascular adhesion development in an anterior spinal surgical rabbit model. METHODS We determined the extent and severity of postoperative adhesion development 34 days after surgery in 12 male New Zealand White rabbits randomly assigned to intraoperative treatment with either DSX or OX, or to an untreated control group. Adhesion severity and extent were scored on scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). RESULTS The extent and severity of adhesions in the DSX group were significantly less than in the untreated control group. The DSX group mean extent score was 1.3 ± 0.5 (vs 2.5, P = .01) and the mean severity score was 1.25 ± 0.5 (vs 2.8, P = .005). The extent and severity of adhesions in the OX group were not significantly different from the control group. CONCLUSION In this study, we found DSX to be the most effective compound in preventing adhesion formation after anterior spine surgery. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Extrapolating these results in rabbits to humans, less scarring between the major blood vessels could decrease the rate of complications in revision spine procedures.","Mo, Fred; Yue, James; Zhang, Jianghui; Howk, Kreg; Williams, Allister",SAS journal,382,1

METHODS The propensity score matching method was applied to patients with HCC treated with MWA (93 patients) or RFA (156 patients) at a single institution from January 2014 to April 2020. The local tumor progression (LTP), intrahepatic distant recurrence (IDR), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) of the two matched therapies were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazard models were used to identify risk factors for LTP and RFS. The therapeutic effects and complications of the two treatments were also compared. RESULTS The LTP, IDR, and RFS of MWA and RFA were equivalent (LTP: hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.36- 2.07; P = 0.746, IDR: HR = 1.03; 95% CI 0.61-1.73; P = 0.890, RFS: HR = 1.15; 95% CI 0.69-1.91; P = 0.566). Para-vessel lesions was the only risk factor for LTP, whereas age, previous treatment, Albumin-Bilirubin score, and tumor diameter were risk factors for RFS. On the other hand, the ablation time per nodule (6.79 ± 2.73 and 9.21 ± 4.90 min; P = 0.008) and number of sessions per nodule required to achieve technical success (1.16 ± 0.39 and 1.34 ± 0.57; P = 0.009) were significantly lower in MWA than in RFA. The major complication rate of MWA and RFA was also equivalent. CONCLUSION MWA and RFA have similar therapeutic effects and safety, although MWA has advantages over RFA regarding efficacy, including shorter ablation time and fewer sessions required.","Suwa, Kanehiko; Seki, Toshihito; Aoi, Kazunori; Yamashina, Masao; Murata, Miki; Yamashiki, Noriyo; Nishio, Akiyoshi; Shimatani, Masaaki; Naganuma, Makoto",Abdominal radiology,382,8

While pulse oximetry is almost universal in the hospital environment, there are circumstances where it is not available or may be unreliable. Cyanosis recognition is affected by lighting colour. In addition, there is, mainly anecdotal, evidence that people with greater colour vision deficiencies (CVDs) have particular difficulty and there is no effective lighting strategy to assist in the observation. The change of blood colour with oxygenation has been shown to lie close to the direction of colour confusions made by congenital red-green dichromats. The important sites of observation are lips, nail beds and palm creases. 10 subjects who were known to be chronically hypoxaemic were recruited from the chronic respiratory program. Their blood oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) varied from 84% to 96% pre-exercise, and 61-84% post-exercise. Ten normal subjects were recruited whose SpO(2) was 99% or 100%. The spectral radiances of lips, nail beds and palm creases were measured using a telespectroradiometer and compared with the spectral radiances of a white tile of known spectral reflectances measured in the same location. This is a non-contact method of measurement, avoiding the blanching caused by pressure of contact methods. The spectral reflectances were calculated, and the chromaticities calculated for a Planckian radiator T = 4000K. Measurements on lips yielded the most consistent results. The colour changes pre- and post-exercise and compared with normal colour lie generally along a deutan confusion line. These results show the direction of the colour change and confirm the, previously anecdotal, difficulties in detecting cyanosis by observers with CVDs.","McNamara, Renae; Taylor, Clair M; McKenzie, David K; Coroneo, Minas T; Dain, Stephen J",Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians,382,1

We analysed missed opportunities in the PrEP cascade in a large-scale project serving female sex workers (FSW), men who have sex with men (MSM) and adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in Kenya. METHODS Programmatic surveillance was conducted using routine programme data from 89 project-supported sites from February 2017 to December 2019, and complemented by qualitative data. Healthcare providers used nationally approved tools to document service statistics. The analyses examined proportions of people moving onto the next step in the PrEP continuum, and identified missed opportunities. Missed opportunities were defined as implementation gaps exemplified by the proportion of individuals who could have potentially accessed each step of the PrEP cascade and did not. We also assessed trends in the cascade indicators at monthly intervals. Qualitative data were collected through 28 focus group discussions with 241 FSW, MSM, AGYW and healthcare providers, and analysed thematically to identify reasons underpinning the missed opportunities. RESULTS During the study period, 299,798 individuals tested HIV negative (211,927 FSW, 47,533 MSM and 40,338 AGYW). Missed opportunities in screening for PrEP eligibility was 58% for FSW, 45% for MSM and 78% for AGYW. Of those screened, 28% FSW, 25% MSM and 65% AGYW were ineligible. Missed opportunities for PrEP initiation were lower among AGYW (8%) compared to FSW (72%) and MSM (75%). Continuation rates were low across all populations at Month-1 (ranging from 29% to 32%) and Month-3 (6% to 8%). Improvements in average annual Month-1 (from 26% to 41%) and Month-3 (from 4% to 15%) continuation rates were observed between 2017 and 2019. While initiation rates were better among younger FSW, MSM and AGYW (<30 years), the reverse was true for continuation. CONCLUSIONS The application of a PrEP cascade framework facilitated this large-scale oral PrEP programme to conduct granular programmatic analysis, detecting ""leaks"" in the cascade. These informed programme adjustments to mitigate identified gaps resulting in improvement of selected programmatic outcomes. PrEP programmes are encouraged to introduce the cascade analysis framework into new and existing programming to optimize HIV prevention outcomes.","Were, Daniel; Musau, Abednego; Mutegi, Jane; Ongwen, Patricia; Manguro, Griffins; Kamau, Mercy; Marwa, Tom; Gwaro, Hellen; Mukui, Irene; Plotkin, Marya; Reed, Jason",Journal of the International AIDS Society,382,1

METHODS Our goal was to describe the epidemiology of respiratory virus infections (RVI) in patients undergoing autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT) in a single tertiary centre observation study during two respiratory virus seasons (2015-2017). All symptomatic auto-SCT patients were tested for RVI by nasopharyngeal swab. RESULTS 156 transplantation episodes were included, 69% were male and, the median age was 57 years. We detected 19 RVIs in 156 transplantation episodes (12%). The median time to RVI after hospitalization was 13 days [IQR 7-13] and 15/19 (79%) had a possible nosocomial origin (occurrence ≥ 5 days after admission). The nosocomial infections included 5/15 (33%) 'severe' RVIs (3 influenza viruses, 1 parainfluenza virus, and 1 adenovirus) as well as 10/15 (66%) non-severe virus infections (including human rhinovirus and human coronavirus). CONCLUSION In approximately 10% of auto-SCT transplantation episodes, an RVI with likely nosocomial origin was detected and included 'severe viruses' such as influenza.

The present study aimed to compare the difference in nociceptive stimulation between the use of a conventional laryngoscope or of a videolaryngoscope. Amount of nociception was assessed indirectly using the peak remifentanil concentration determined by a closed-loop administration of propofol and remifentanil with bispectral index (BIS) as the input signal (target 50). METHODS A prospective single-center randomized study was performed including surgical patients without predictable risk of difficult mask ventilation or of difficult tracheal intubation. Forty consecutive surgery patients were randomly assigned to CL group (conventional laryngoscope) or VL group (McGrath Mac videolaryngoscope). Induction of anesthesia was performed automatically using the closed-loop system and myorelaxation with atracurium. The allocation was revealed just before tracheal intubation. The primary outcome was the peak plasma remifentanil concentration observed during the 5-minute period which followed intubation. RESULTS Sixteen patients in the CL group and 11 in the VL group were analyzed. Plasmatic remifentanil and propofol concentrations were similar in both groups either before tracheal intubation or during the 5 minutes following intubation. There was a nonsignificant between-group difference (P = .09) for the peak concentration of remifentanil. A comparable result was observed for other outcomes except for the heart rate which increased in the CL group. CONCLUSION Use of the videolaryngoscope McGrath Mac did not reduce the nociceptive stimulation induced during intubation as evaluated by the automatically administered remifentanil concentration.

Methods We systematically reviewed all indexed studies examining the association between PAI-1 and MACE (defined as death, myocardial infarction, or cerebrovascular accident) or restenosis. EMBASE, Web of Science, Medline, and the Cochrane Library were searched through October 2016 to identify relevant studies, supplemented by letters to authors and review of citations. Studies reporting the results of PAI-1 antigen and/or activity levels in association with MACE in human subjects were included. Results Of 5961 articles screened, we identified 38 articles published between 1991 to 2016 that reported PAI-1 levels in 11,557 patients. In studies that examined PAI-1 antigen and activity levels, 15.1% and 29.6% of patients experienced MACE, respectively. Patients with MACE had higher PAI-1 antigen levels with a mean difference of 6.11 ng/mL (95% CI, 3.27-8.96). This finding was similar among patients with and without known coronary artery disease. Comparatively, studies that stratified by PAI-1 activity levels were not associated with MACE. In contrast, studies of coronary restenosis suggest PAI-1 antigen and activity levels are negatively associated with MACE. Conclusions Elevated plasma PAI-1 antigen levels are associated with MACE. Definitive studies are needed to ascertain if PAI-1 acts simply as a marker of risk or if it is indeed a bona fide therapeutic target.","Jung, Richard G; Motazedian, Pouya; Ramirez, F Daniel; Simard, Trevor; Di Santo, Pietro; Visintini, Sarah; Faraz, Mohammad Ali; Labinaz, Alisha; Jung, Young; Hibbert, Benjamin",Thrombosis journal,382,1

Several studies established the consequences of pandemic lockdown on air quality using satellite remote sensing. However, such studies have limitations, including low spatial resolution or incomplete spatial coverage. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a machine learning-based scheme to solve the pre-mentioned limitations by training an optimized space-time extra trees model for each year of the study period. The results have shown that our trained models reach a prediction accuracy up to 95% when predicting the missing values in the MODIS MCD19A2 Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) product. The outcome of the mentioned scheme was a geo-harmonized atmospheric dataset for aerosol optical depth at 550 nm with 1 km spatial resolution and full coverage over Europe. As an application, we used the proposed machine learning based prediction approach in AOD levels analysis. We compared the mean AOD levels between the lockdown period from March to June in 2020 and the mean AOD values of the same period for the past 5 years. We found that AOD levels dropped over most European countries in 2020 but increased in several eastern and western countries. The Netherlands had the most significant average decrease in AOD levels (19%), while Spain had the highest average increase (10%). Moreover, we analyzed the relationship between the relative percentage difference of AOD and four meteorological variables. We found a positive correlation between AOD and relative humidity and a negative correlation between AOD and wind speed. The value of the proposed prediction scheme is further emphasized by taking into consideration that the reconstructed dataset can be used for future air quality studies concerning Europe.","Ibrahim, Saleem Landa Martin Pešek Ondřej Pavelka Karel Halounova Lena",Remote Sensing,382,20

This is one of the very first studies which discuss a methodological framework that incorporates prior financial domain knowledge into neural network architecture design and model training. The proposed model outperforms the benchmarked models with the option data on the S&P 500 index over 20 years.

While recognising the necessity for exploring employees' perceptions and interaction with technology as the ultimate requirement for a functional work-from-home, this study observes the factors that would determine job performance. Thus, adhering to the Job Demands-Resources theory, we argue that employees' ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) anxiety and smartphone addiction can inhibit their work progress by provoking interruptions in the course and reducing the efficacy, further affecting performance. PLS-SEM (Partial Least Squares - Structural Equation Modelling) was employed to analyse the data collected by 363 employees working from home due to Covid-19 restrictive measures. The results reveal that employees’ reluctance and apprehensiveness related to the use of ICT and their dependency on smartphone usage act as distractions that impact the efficient achievement of work goals.

We considered periods of infection spread during the first and second wave in Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries and countries in Africa, that is developed and developing countries alongside their social-economic data. We established a mathematical and statistical relationship between Theil and Gini index, then we studied the relationship between the data from epidemiology and socio-economic determinants using several machine learning and deep learning methods. High correlations were observed between some of the socio-economic and epidemiologic parameters and we predicted three of the socio-economic variables in order to validate our results.

We aimed to investigate whether KD is linked to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Chinese pediatric population. Methods: Patients were enrolled if diagnosed with KD in the 40 hospitals of China Kawasaki Disease Research Collaborative Group from January to April 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic period in China. Information of demographic data, KD shock syndrome, macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the number of KD cases were retrospectively analyzed. Results: The completed response was received from 29/40 hospitals (72.5%) across 19 provinces. Of 2,108 KD patients enrolled, the median age was 1.9 years and 63.8% were male. KD shock syndrome and MAS were diagnosed in 8 (0.4%) and 2 (0.1%) patients, respectively, none of whom had contact history with COVID-19 patients. A greater number of KD cases from January to April 2020 than the upper limit of 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of estimated numbers of cases of the past 3 years were observed in only 2 out of 29 (6.9%) hospitals. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests in 434 patients and antibody tests in 64 patients for SARS-CoV-2 were all negative, including nine with exposure history. Conclusions: There is no evidence of the link of KD with COVID-19 in Chinese children in terms of its prevalence and severity. © Pediatric Medicine.

A newly explored coronavirus caused it. Currently, more than 112 million verified cases of COVID-19, containing 2,4 million deaths, are reported to WHO (February 2021). Scientists are working to develop treatments. Early detection and treatment of COVID-19 are critical to fighting disease. Recently, automated systems, specifically deep learning-based models, address the COVID-19 diagnosis task. There are various ways to test COVID-19. Imaging technologies are widely available, and chest X-ray and computed tomography images are helpful. A publicly available dataset was used in this study, including chest X-ray images of normal, COVID-19, and viral pneumonia. Firstly, images were pre-processed. Three deep learning models, namely DarkNet-53, ResNet-18, and Xception, were used in feature extraction from images. The number of extracted features was decreased by Binary Particle Swarm Optimization. Lastly, features were classified using Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and XGBoost. The maximum accuracy score is 99.7% in a multi-classification task. This study reveals that pre-trained deep learning models with a metaheuristic-based feature selection give robust results.

Movement path tortuosity (Fractal D) describes the actual path traversed;it increases as more random turns are added. Although time is not used in its calculation because it is a spatial measure, the quantification of path tortuosity has yielded a novel means to describe path characteristics that correlate with temporal measures.= Objective: After summarizing the initial published application of Fractal D to human movement paths, its applications to numerous areas are reviewed. Method: Fractal D quantifies the degree a path deviates from a straight line, yielding an index that ranges from 1.0 (perfect straightness) to 2.0 (chaotic). Fractal D has been successfully used when subjects’ real time location systems data are the source. Results: Research is summarized relating elevated path tortuosity to cognitive deficits in young and elderly adults, the prediction of future falls, movement paths during searches of virtual spaces, evaluation of drug effects, and automatic monitoring of multiple persons moving in common spaces and social distancing. Conclusion: After its application from describing free movements of wild animals, the adaptation of Fractal D to human movement path variability has spread to several areas of study. © 2021, Gerontechnology.

However, the data comparing between these two vaccines in the same setting are limited. Objectives: To determine adverse events (AEs) and immunogenicity of CoronaVac and ChAdOx1 in health care workers (HCWs). Design: This prospective study was conducted from February to July 2021. Setting: A single center, university-based tertiary care center in Bangkok. Participants: Healthy HCWs. Exposure: Two doses of CoronaVac (4 weeks apart) or ChAdOx1 (8 weeks apart) intramuscularly. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-reported AEs were collected for 7 days following each vaccination using electronic diary. The immunogenicity was determined by the level of IgG antibodies against receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S1 subunit). The 50% plaque reduction neutralization tests against original Wuhan strain and circulating VOCs were performed in subset of samples at 2 weeks after the second dose. Results: Of the 360 HCWs, 180 received each vaccine. The median (interquartile range: IQR) age was 35 (29-44) years old and 84.2% were female. Participants who received ChAdOx1 reported higher frequency of AEs than those received CoronaVac after both the first dose (84.4% vs. 66.1%, P < 0.001) and second dose (75.6% vs. 60.6%, P = 0.002), with more AEs in those younger than 30 years of age for both vaccines. The seroconversion rate was 75.6% and 100% following the first dose of CoronaVac and ChAdOx1, respectively. All participants seroconverted at 2 weeks after the second dose. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG levels induced by CoronaVac was lower than ChAdOX1 with geometric means of 164.4 and 278.5 BAU/mL, respectively (P = 0.0066). Both vaccines induced similar levels of neutralizing antibodies against the Wuhan strain, geometric mean titer (GMT) of 337.4 vs 331.2; however, CoronaVac induced significantly lower GMT against Alpha (23.1 vs. 92.5), Delta (21.2 vs. 69.7), and Beta (10.2 vs. 43.6) variants, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: CoronaVac induces lower measurable antibodies but with lower frequency of AEs than ChAdOx1. The low neutralizing antibodies against the circulating VOCs induced by CoronaVac supports the need for earlier boosting to prevent breakthrough infections.

These aspects may be particularly relevant in stress-related disorders such as fibromyalgia (FM) in which previous evidence demonstrated a causal effect of psychological stressors on chronic non-inflammatory pain of FM (2). Recent studies highlighted a significant worsening of FM symptoms after COVID-19 related lockdown period (3-4), but the levels of perceived stress and distress have not been evaluated yet. Objectives: The aim of this study is to establish the COVID-19 related perceived stress and distress among patients with FM who experienced the COVID-19 quarantine in Italy. Data were retrieved from a larger nationwide online survey involving patients affected by different rheumatic diseases (RD). Methods: We collected data from May to September 2020 from RD patients living in Italy during the COVID-19 quarantine by an ad-hoc online survey. Eleven associations of RD patients sent a call by using their mailing list, webpages and social network. They asked to complete an anonymous online survey which included the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the Impact Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize results. Results: 79 of 507 (15.6%) of RD patients who completed the survey declared to have been diagnosed FM. 77 (97.5%) were females, with a mean (± SD) age of 51.0 ± 12.4 yrs. In FM patients, the mean (SD) PSS score was 23.8 ± 8.1. In particular, 8 (10.1%) reported low, 38 (48.1%) moderate and 33 (41.8%) high PSS scores. Moreover, IES-R mean (SD) score was 38.5 ± 17.2. Among FM patients, 51 (64.6%) reported scores greater than 33, indicating the probable presence of a PTSD. With regard to the IES-R subscale scores, the total sample did not show a prominence of one of the three main domains: intrusion (13.9 ± 7.3), avoidance (11.9 ± 6.1) and hyperarousal (12.6 ± 5.9). In these FM patients, self-reported major sources of anxiety were related to personal and relatives' health (59.5%), followed by social withdrawal (21.5%) and employment loss/ financial difficulties (11.4%). There was a slight increase of self-reported use of antidepressants (15 [18.9%] vs 16 [20.2%]) and anxiolytics drugs (4 [5.1%] vs 5 [6.3%]) after lockdown period. Conclusion: These results confirm that psychosocial stress and distress were highly pervasive in FM after COVID-19 national lockdown. It is known that stressed status may exacerbate and/or precipitate later development of FM symptoms. These data support the substantial worsening of somatic burden of FM after lockdown period reported in previous studies (3-4). Coping strategies should be implemented to ameliorate psychological well-being of these patients in this stressful era.","Ingegnoli, F.; Buoli, M.; Posio, C.; Di Taranto, R.; Caporali, R.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,382,16

Subjects were placed into two groups based on age - those 60 and above and those less than 60. Patients were questioned regarding their demographics, behavioral practices, and their primary news source related to the pandemic. Traditional news sources were defined as TV, radio, or newspaper. Modern news sources included any form of social media. Results: Of the 115 subjects eligible for this study, 49 agreed to participate (42.6%). Of these, 27 (55%) were age 60 and above and 22 were under the age of 60 (45%). In the older group, all subjects reported using traditional media while only eight subjects (30%) also reported obtaining healthcare information from modern news sources. In the younger group, 16 subjects (73%) reported using traditional media while 14 (63%) simultaneously reported using modern media. When comparing the groups, there was no statistically significant difference in utilization of traditional news sources by age, however, the older group was much less likely to receive their information from modern media (P &lt; 0.001). Regarding preventative measures, women over the age of 60 were more likely to quarantine than the younger group (OR = 2.35).

Remote monitoring can help with the critical need for early detection of symptoms among those diagnosed with COVID-19, enabling timely symptom management that can mitigate clinical deterioration. In response to this need, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center fast-tracked a program to monitor patients with COVID-19 from home, using an electronic symptom-tracking questionnaire and digital pulse oximeter to track patients' status and alert care teams to intervene if symptoms worsened. A multi-disciplinary group composed of Oncology providers, advanced practice providers, nursing, nursing informatics and biomedical informatics formed to manage the program. Methods: Memorial Sloan Kettering launched a remote monitoring program for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 on March 25, 2020. All patients testing positive for COVID-19 were enrolled in the program and asked to complete a daily symptom tracking questionnaire accessed through their patient portal or administered verbally over the phone. A subset of high risk patients were also provided with a digital pulse oximeter linked to their patient portal and capable of transmitting readings directly to the care team. Clinicians received alerts for patients reporting symptoms or an oxygen saturation below 92%. Alerts resulted in an immediate response from the care team to determine if the patient needed additional care. We retrospectively evaluated the program usage, outcomes and learnings from March 25, 2020 to December 22, 2020. Results: In total, 1,721 patients were enrolled in the program from March 25, 2020 to December 22, 2020. Among these, 210 were deemed high risk patients who received a pulse oximeter in addition the daily symptom questionnaire. Over this period, 27% of patients triggered an alert from an electronic symptom questionnaire, and 63% of patients with a pulse oximeter triggered an alert from their device. Among patients who triggered an alert of any kind, 3% were triaged to a higher level of care. Patients reported that the program was highly valued and alleviated anxiety about their care. Iterative improvements were made to the program over time in response to the evolving knowledge about care for patients with COVID-19. Conclusions: Memorial Sloan Kettering was able to quickly implement a program to detect and triage symptoms among patients with COVID-19 and cancer. Refinements were made over time to many aspects of the program in response to learnings about care related to COVID-19, including to clinical eligibility, alert criteria, monitoring duration and workflows. The program also demonstrated value for patients who felt more comfortable with their care while being monitored remotely. This program established a successful model for remote monitoring of patients with COVID-19 with the potential to be scaled to other institutions or clinical areas.","Pugliese, L.; Garcia, J.; Holland, J.

However, both approaches have far-reaching socioeconomic implications. Therefore, we evaluated the implications of quarantine and testing compared to the reductions achieved by border closure on in-country imminent transmission based on country-specific prevalence, daily incidence, vaccine coverage, immunity, age-demographics, and travel flow. We considered travel quarantines of 0-14 days with and without RT-PCR or antigen testing for COVID-19 in 31 European countries. Our analysis demonstrates that for the vast majority of origin-destination country pairs, there are combinations of short-duration quarantine and testing that are as effective as border closure. Furthermore, for most origin-destination country pairs, travel with testing and no quarantine will reduce imminent in-country transmission more than would border closure. We find that the duration of quarantine is predominantly influenced by country prevalence and quantity of travel. With higher prevalence in the origin country compared to the destination country, the minimum duration of quarantine increases from zero to beyond fourteen days (at which point border closure would likely be practical). Asymmetry in travel flow can also cause an increase or decrease of infections within the destination country, respectively resulting in longer and shorter quarantines. We apply the same framework to genetic variants of concern to limit their spread as a consequence of travel; the widespread variant of concern B.1.1.7 yields similar sufficient quarantine and testing regimes, whereas the lower-frequency, geographically heterogeneous 501Y.V2 variant requires longer, more specific quarantines. We show that adaptation of our analytical framework to the European Union traffic-light country risk stratification provides a simplified policy tool. Lastly, we examined the effect of travel quarantine and testing or border closure policy on hospitalization in the destination country. We find that hospitalization rates in the destination country are far more sensitive to changes in the vaccine coverage than on the duration of the travel quarantine or the country of origin. Our analysis provides rigorous guidelines enabling travel between most countries during early and late phases of pandemic disease.","Wells, C. R.; Townsend, J. P.; Pandey, A.; Fitzpatrick, M.

Here we demonstrate a high contrast cleavage detection (HCCD) assay on a micro-ring resonator to sense the cleavage of DNA reporters linked to high-contrast nanoparticles (NPs), leading to dramatic optical signal amplification. The HCCD mechanism is coupled with a CRISPR-Cas12a assay for rapid and sensitive on-chip nucleic acid detection. Leveraging high-contrast gold nanoparticle (AuNP) reporters, an -8 nm resonance shift is observed by using a 1 nM of complementary DNA (cDNA) target, matching part of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence. In addition, we show that a micro-ring resonator can not only record the entire surface functionalization process, as has been show previously, but also monitor CRISPR reactions in-situ.

A total of 453 genomic sequences of Pakistani SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved from GISAID and subjected to MAFFT-based alignment and QC check which resulted in removal of 53 samples. The remaining 400 samples were subjected to Pangolin-based genomic lineage identification. And to infer our SARS-CoV-2 time-scaled and divergence phylogenetic trees, 3,804 selected global reference sequences plus 400 Pakistani samples were used for the Nextstrain analysis with Wuhan/Hu-1/2019, as reference genome. Finally, maximum likelihood based phylogenetic tree was built by using the Nextstrain & coverage map was created by employing Nextclade. And by using the amino acid subsitutions the maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were developed for each wave, separately. Our results reveal the circulation of 29 lineages, belonging to following 7 clades G, GH, GR, GRY, L, O, & S in the three waves. From first wave, 16 genomic lineages of SARS-CoV-2 were identified with B.1(24.7%), B.1.36(18.8%), & B.1.471(18.8%) as the most prevalent lineages respectively. The second wave data showed 18 lineages, 10 of which were overlapping with the first wave suggesting that those variants could not be contained during the first wave. In this wave, a new lineage, AE.4, was reported from Pakistan for the very first time in the world. However, B.1.36 (17.8%), B.1.36.31 (11.9%), B.1.1.7 (8.5%) & B.1.1.1 (5.9%) were the major lineages in second wave.

Existing classifications of plots have been proven to possess a great ability to capture ""universal"" policy stories, but not the specific variations of different types of policies. This article presents a typology of plots by linking their universal and policy-specific themes, thereby theorizing from Lowi's seminal typology of regulatory, distributive, and redistributive policies. Empirically, it focuses on the political communication of Germany's policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Policy narratives were mined from Twitter and from governmental press conferences (March-June 2020).

In this global crisis, the tourism and hospitality sector has collapsed in almost all parts of the world, and the same is true for India. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the impact of Covid-19 on the Indian tourism industry. Design/methodology/approach: This study develops an appropriate model to forecast the expected loss of foreign tourist arrivals (FTAs) in India for 10 months. Since the FTAs follow a seasonal trend, seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) method has been employed to forecast the expected FTAs in India from March 2020 to December 2020. The results of the proposed model are then compared with the ones obtained by Holt-Winter's (H-W) model to check the robustness of the proposed model. Findings: The SARIMA model seeks to manifest the monthly arrival of foreign tourists and also elaborates on the progressing expected loss of foreign tourists arrive for the next three quarters is approximately 2 million, 2.3 million and 3.2 million, respectively. Thus, in the next three quarters, there will be an enormous downfall of FTAs, and there is a need to adopt appropriate measures. The comparison demonstrates that SARIMA is a better model than H-W model. Originality/value: Several studies have been reported on pandemic-affected tourism sectors using different techniques. The earlier pandemic outbreak was controlled and region-specific, but the Covid-19 eruption is a global threat having potential ramifications and strong spreading power. This work is one of the first attempts to study and analyse the impact of Covid-19 on FTAs in India. © 2021, Md Ozair Arshad, Shahbaz Khan, Abid Haleem, Hannan Mansoor, Md Osaid Arshad and Md Ekrama Arshad.","Arshad, M.

Induction chemotherapy (ICH), leukapheresis and hydroxyurea (HU) are the most frequent used leukoreductive strategies. Delay in ICH is very common, leukapheresis is not widely available and hydroxyurea and leukapheresis do not modify early mortality rates. Therefore alternative strategies to leukoreduce patients with AML and hyperleukocytosis are needed. Vinblastine is widely available, cheap, with preclinical activity and promising results in relapsed AML. We explored the leukoreductive power of a single dose of vinblastine in patients with newly diagnosed AML and hyperleukocytosis. Patients and methods We conducted a prospective pilot study that included consecutive patients with newly diagnosed non-M3 AML, aged 16 to 60 years, and with a WBC ≥50,000/µL at time of presentation and in whom immediate ICH with 7+3 was not possible because of hospital limitations (i.e. delay in ICH drug availability). We excluded patients with PML/RAR-alfa rearrangement and/or t(15;17), poor performance status (ECOG >2), any preceding chemotherapy, organic dysfunction (defined as a modified Marshall score ≥2) or pregnancy. After diagnostic confirmation, a single dose of vinblastine at 6 mg/m2 i.v. was administered. We documented leukocytes (WBC) and number of blasts on the day of vinblastine administration (0h) and 48 hours later. We represented the achieved leukoreduction with boxplots and compared the absolute reduction in WBC (delta WBC) and blasts (delta blasts) after vinblastine administration. We compared the leukoreductive power of vinblastine to other leukoreductive strategies (HU, leukapheresis). We calculated toxicities (grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia), median length of hospitalization and parental antibiotics, and overall survival (OS). We documented cases of disseminated intravascular coagulation, leukostasis and tumor lysis syndrome. This study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki, and our local ethics committee. Results A total of 11 patients were enrolled in the study, seven were men (63.6%), with a median age of 48 (21-78) years. Median follow-up was 21 days (2-833 days). The most frequent morphologic subtype was M4 (3, 27.3%), M5 (2, 18.2%) and M2 (2, 18.2%). Cytogenetics were obtained in three cases (27.3%) and all of them were classified as intermediate risk. Forty eight hours after vinblastine administration the WBC lowered from 122x109/L (50.1-380) to 47.3x109/L (22.1-170) representing a 54% (26.7-84.2) decrese (p=0.0001) (figure 1) while blasts number lowered from 204 x 109/L (47.8-361) to 6.4 x 109/L (0-1.6) representing a 85.7% (75-100) decrease (p=0.005) (figure 1). In Table 1 we compare our results with other strategies. All patients experienced grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. There were no cases of disseminated intravascular coagulation, leukostasis or tumor lysis syndrome. Severe infections (grade III-IV) occurred in 8 patients (two patients presented neutropenic colitis, five with severe pneumonia, and one SARS-COV2). Four patients presented septic shock and died during induction therapy. Median length of hospitalization and parental antibiotics were 19 days (2-30) and 7 days (range, 2-24), respectively. A CR was achieved in 4 patients (36.4%) after one induction cycle. One patient presented refractory disease and five died before response evaluation. One patient relapsed at 16 months of follow-up. Median OS was 11 months (0-31.8). Allogeneic stem cell transplantation was performed in 1 patient. Conclusion We documented a marked reduction in both WBC and blasts after 48 hours of vinblastine administration. Our study suggests that the leukoreductive power of a single dose of vinblastine is similar to HU and leukapheresis in patients with AML with hyperleukocytosis. Vinblastine is a widely available, cheap and myelotoxic drug that could extend the arsenal to treat newly diagnosed AML with hyperleukocytosis.

Whilst diagnostic testing has progressed at pace, there is an unmet clinical need to develop tests that are prognostic, to triage the high volumes of patients arriving in hospital settings. Recent research has shown that serum metabolomics has potential for prognosis of disease progression. 1 In a hospital setting, collection of saliva samples is more convenient for both staff and patients, and therefore offers an alternative sampling matrix to serum. We demonstrate here for the first time that saliva metabolomics can reveal COVID-19 severity. Methods 88 saliva samples were collected from hospitalised patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19, alongside clinical metadata. COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed using RT-PCR testing. COVID severity was classified using clinical descriptors first proposed by SR Knight et al. Metabolites were extracted from saliva samples and analysed using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Results In this work, positive percent agreement of 1.00 between a PLS-DA metabolomics model and the clinical diagnosis of COVID severity was achieved. The negative percent agreement with the clinical severity diagnosis was also 1.00, for overall percent agreement of 1.00. Conclusions This research demonstrates that liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry can identify salivary biomarkers capable of separating high severity COVID-19 patients from low severity COVID-19 patients in a small cohort study.","Bailey, M.; Spick, M.

Couples living through the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States are facing a unique set of stressors and are likely to experience changes in relationship outcomes as a result. The vulnerability–stress–adaptation (VSA) model suggests that relationship stability and relationship satisfaction are related to demographic variables, individual vulnerabilities (i.e., mental health), external stressors (i.e., finances), and relationship processes (i.e., communication patterns). The current study evaluates each of these variables as potential predictors of relationship satisfaction and thoughts of separating from a relationship, with the goal of identifying risk factors for relationship outcomes in the pandemic. A total of 782 adults with cohabitating intimate partners (89.8% White, 84.5% female) were recruited for an online study during the COVID-19 shutdown phase from April 3 through May 22, 2020. Results suggested that higher relationship satisfaction during the shutdown was related to not having children in the home, lower money stress, higher sexual fulfillment, lower relationship invalidation, and higher perceived fairness of relationship power. Higher thoughts of separation were related to younger age, higher verbal aggression, higher relationship invalidation, and lower relationship satisfaction. Overall, findings support the use of the VSA as a model for understanding the effect of pandemic stress on relationships and indicate that relationships are being affected by many aspects of the pandemic. Couples’ support interventions will need to be adapted to adequately promote relationship health in this difficult time.

Simulation-based teaching is a promising tool to introduce learners to the clinical environment. MacSim is a student-led simulation workshop for learners to develop clinical competencies. The objective of this study was to assess the impacts of MacSim and participants' perspectives regarding simulation-based teaching. Methods: A comprehensive simulation, representative of a virtual care scenario, was delivered to 42 pre-clerkship medical students via video conferencing. In pairs, participants obtained histories and carried out management plans for simulated patients. Participants were surveyed and interviewed. Survey data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test. Interview transcript data were thematically analyzed. Results: Post-simulation, participants (n=24) felt more prepared to make clinical decisions, collaborate, and communicate in a virtual setting. 92% of respondents agreed MacSim was a valuable learning experience and 96% agreed more simulation-based learning should be integrated into curricula. Emergent themes from interviews (n=12) included: 1) value of simulation fidelity, 2) value of physician feedback, and 3) effectiveness of MacSim in improving virtual clinical skills. Conclusion: Simulation-based teaching is of importance and educational value to medical students. It may play an increasingly prevalent role in education as virtual care is likely to become more prevalent.","Wu, K.; Chan, A.; Pandey, A.; Panchal, P.; Khalid, M.; Bala, S.; Shah, S.; Miller, M.

Today, the world is facing the pandemic of COVID-19, a disease caused by the new coronavirus. In all social dimensions, the effects have been significant, mainly because of social isolation, a measure considered efficient to stop the spread of the disease. In Brazil, isolation was established by the government and culminated in the temporary closure of developments that provide non-essential services, in which tourism is included. Therefore, the objective of this article is to discuss the role of the State in mitigating the impacts of the pandemic on the tourism industry, analyzing the public policies adopted and characteristics such as: political sphere, context, scope, content, and criteria for effectiveness. It is an exploratory and descriptive research, whose methodological path consisted of searching for keywords on scientific platforms and government websites and sectorial tourism institutions, both in Brazil and worldwide. The information obtained was organized, systematized, and analyzed using Content Analysis. The results show that the public policies implemented by the government are of a structural nature, with a focus on maintaining jobs and income for entrepreneurs and workers in specific segments of the production chain;provisional/emergency, therefore, restricted to the pandemic period;and regulatory, standardizing security and prevention protocols for COVID-19 during the economic recovery process.

The whole sensor device is attached to a surgical tape, which allows the band-aid like attachment of the sensor to human skin to measure the vibration caused by the physiological parameters such as pulse wave, heart sound and respiration. Using the fabricated sensor device, we demonstrate two applications: the simultaneous measurements of pulse wave and respiration when attaching the sensor to the user's nose and the simultaneous measurements of heart sound and respiration using when attaching the sensor to the user's chest. We show that these the physiological parameters can be independently extracted from the cantilever output using low pass and high pass filters.

However, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many students are learning from home, rendering laboratory instruction a particular challenge. Options for educators include third party virtual and prerecorded materials, at-home laboratory experiments, and original prerecorded and real-time instruction. Here, we report the assessment of a variety of technological setups for real-time and prerecorded original content looking at a variety of audio and video sources as well as one-camera and two-camera options. We intentionally selected equipment that we had readily available and ensured our recordings were as close to the student experience as possible by recording via a secondary computer signed into an online learning platform. Upon a survey of a small group of students at Quest University Canada, we found that 72% of students preferred a two-camera setup using a smartphone to film the instructor as a whole and a web camera to provide a close-up view of the chemistry taking place. This setup was used for a diversity of real-time and prerecorded experiments delivered remotely at Quest University including titrations, basic synthetic reactions, and purifications. For two of the experiments, a titration lab and a synthesis and purification lab, we assessed the ability of different remote learning options to meet pre-COVID-19 learning outcomes. Real-time, digital laboratory instruction is clearly the most effective. In addition, we suggest scenarios where using digital techniques may create efficiencies in laboratory teaching upon the return to on-campus learning. ©","Davy, E. C.; Quane, S.

However, early classes might impede learning by contributing to absenteeism and insufficient sleep. We used big datasets collected passively from university students to test the hypothesis that morning classes are associated with poorer attendance, shorter sleep, and lower grades. Wi-Fi connection data were used to estimate attendance rates of 24,678 students enrolled in lecture courses with start times ranging from 08:00 to 16:00. Students’ interactions with the university’s Learning Management System (LMS) were used to estimate nocturnal sleep opportunities by compiling 17.4 million logins from 39,458 students with data sorted by students’ first class of the day. Objective sleep behavior was assessed in 181 students who took part in a 6-week actigraphy study. We found that Wi-Fi confirmed attendance was about 15 percentage points lower in students taking classes at 08:00 compared with later start times. Actigraphy data revealed that students frequently slept past the start of morning classes. LMS and actigraphy data showed that nocturnal sleep opportunities and total sleep time decreased with earlier class start times due to students waking up earlier. Analyses of grades in 27,281 students showed that having morning classes on more days of the week resulted in a lower grade point average. These findings suggest cumulative negative effects of morning classes on learning. Early morning classes force many students to decide to either sleep more and skip class, or sleep less to attend class. Therefore, universities should avoid scheduling early morning classes. Significance Statement We show that morning classes are associated with lower attendance, shorter nocturnal sleep, and lower grade point average in university students. Scalable methods for measuring attendance and sleep were developed using students’ Wi-Fi connection data and interactions with the Learning Management System. Students had lower attendance rates and frequently slept past the start of early morning classes. However, students still lost about an hour of sleep on average when they had early morning classes due to waking up earlier than usual. Students who had morning classes on more days of the week had a lower grade point average. Our results suggest cumulative negative effects of morning classes on students’ academic performance. Universities should avoid scheduling early morning classes.","Yeo, Sing Chen; Lai, Clin K.Y.; Tan, Jacinda; Lim, Samantha; Chandramoghan, Yuvan; Gooley, Joshua J.",bioRxiv,382,24

Moreover, the parameters influencing stress levels of the immigrants were analyzed.MethodsDemographics, level of stress and current psychological conditions of participants were gathered and analyzed through a structured survey. Besides, in-person interviews were conducted to explore the responses of the participants to receive more and deeper information.ResultsThe sample consists of 110 responders (45.3 % males;51.8 % females). The findings of the study illustrated that while there was no relationship between gender of the immigrants and the level of stress, participants with low income (27.5 %) and unemployed immigrants (24.2 %) felt more worried and anxious. As time passes, the anxiety level of the participants decreased by 49.1 % but 40.9 % of the participants still experience severe anxiety.ConclusionsThe findings demonstrate that having low income or being unemployed as well as the cancellation of travel plans, are positively related with the depression level of the participants.

Design/methodology/approach: Five SCRES components are identified from the literature review and data are collected using an web survey from 113 manufacturing companies in Taiwan. The data are analyzed by structured equation modeling with the partial least square solution. Two-stage least-squares (2SLS) regression was used to test the potential endogeneity of SC collaboration (SCC). Findings: The results reveal that SCC is an exogenous driver of SCRES;it directly affects visibility, velocity, flexibility, robustness and SCPUD. Furthermore, SC flexibility is the only component of SC agility that directly affects SCPUD;it is influenced directly by SC velocity and indirectly by SC visibility through SC velocity. SC visibility is a vital agility component that positively influences SC velocity and SC robustness. Research limitations/implications: The data in this study are cross-sectional and the sample size of 113 is relatively small. The relationship between SC robustness and SCPUD needs a longer observation period to reveal. The logistic issue in the shortage of carriers caused by the pandemic has been overlooked. Practical implications: A firm should enhance its collaboration and flexibility in the SC as they both are the critical antecedents of SC performance (SCP) during the disruption period. Originality/value: This study integrates visibility, velocity, flexibility, robustness and collaboration into a complete framework of SCRES. The dependent variable, SCPUD, measures SC performance (SCP) under the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Many warned that this risked damaging public confidence during a critical period of pandemic response. This study investigated whether the pause in the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine had an impact on subsequent vaccine uptake in European countries. Methods We used a difference-in-differences approach capitalizing on the fact that some countries halted their rollouts whilst others did not. A longitudinal panel was constructed for European Economic Area countries spanning 15 weeks in early 2021. Media reports were used to identify countries that paused the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and the timing of this. Data on vaccine uptake were available through the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker. Difference-in-differences linear regression models controlled for key confounders that could influence vaccine uptake, and country and week fixed effects. Further models and robustness checks were performed. Results The panel included 28 countries, with 19 in the intervention group and 9 in the control group. Pausing the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was associated with a 0.52% decrease in uptake for the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and a 1.49% decrease in the uptake for both doses, comparing countries that paused to those that did not. These estimates are not statistically significant (p=0.86 and 0.39 respectively). For the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine only, the pause was associated with a 0.56% increase in uptake for the first dose and a 0.07% decrease in uptake for both doses. These estimates are also not statistically significant (p= 0.56 and 0.51 respectively). All our findings are robust to sensitivity analyses.

Trainees reported that unequal deployment was impacting their workload and morale. eRostering was proposed as a solution.MethodsThe software chosen (HealthRota) was previously reviewed by the Trust’s Junior Doctors’ Forum. The solution offered limited contractual tie-in at low cost, so was approved by the Trust and rolled out quickly to support the COVID-19 response. The initial ‘back end’ rollout of medical on-call rotas and supplementary departments was completed in three days. Within two weeks, all end users had logins to view their rotas and the availability of the wider medical team.ResultsThe solution’s effectiveness was determined by feedback from the rota coordinators and questionnaires from clinicians. Within a month of launch, 95% of junior doctors had used the software and 60% had used the mobile application. Their reported understanding of colleagues’ deployment was significantly improved. Rota coordinators supported the change, reporting a greater overview of staffing and lower dependency on locums.ConclusionseRostering can be implemented at pace and efficiency does not mean a reduction in quality of the eventual solution, especially if there is early stakeholder engagement.The rapid, successful deployment of eRostering software during the COVID-19 pandemic shows how an agile healthcare organisation can act decisively to implement new IT solutions faster than previously thought possible.eRostering saves time, but to benefit fully rota coordinators need to adjust deployment on a daily basis and must be adequately resourced.","Johnson, Mark Gardner Stephen",BMJ Leader,382,19

The highest dose of vaccine, namely 10(8) formalin-killed E. coli by parenteral routes or 3 X 10(9) live E. coli by peroral (p.o.) route resulted in the best effect, whatever the immunization procedure used. A single vaccination of the mothers mainly delayed death without marked reduction of the mortality rate. Subcutaneous (s.c.) immunization with 10(8) formalin-killed E. coli was nevertheless more efficient than p.o. vaccination with 3 X 10(8) live E. coli. Equal levels of protection were observed when the above s.c. vaccination occurred either 15 days before the onset of gestation or on the 8th day or 15th day. In contrast, the p.o. immunization resulted in no effect when done on the 15th day of gestation. Great improvement in protection was obtained with two vaccinations, when priming occurred 15 days before the onset of gestation and boosting on the 8th day, except with two combined p.o. vaccinations with 3 X 10(8) live E. coli. Both dosages of priming and boosting seemed to matter. Peroral, subcutaneous or intraperitoneal priming with about 10(8) E. coli resulted in nearly equal effects, when boosting occurred subcutaneously with 10(8) killed E. coli. However, i.p. priming probably resulted in some non-specific effect, as shown by the slower clinical evolution of the controls. A tenfold dosage increase in p.o. priming alone led to the best protective effect observed when boosting was done three weeks after priming. The occurrence of s.c. boosting one week later, namely four weeks after priming, markedly improved protection with every route tested, and more particularly with the s.c. one. However, complete protection was never obtained. Protective effect was mostly transmitted after birth by the colostrum and the milk of the immune mothers, as demonstrated by cross-fostering experiments. Using the best immunization procedures, variability of the model was studied, by repeating experiments several times. Clinical evolution of the controls was very similar from one experiment to another, whatever the route and the moment of immunizations. In contrast, vaccinated groups showed variations which increased with time, especially on and after seven days following inoculation. Clinical evolution of individual litters belonging to the same experimental group indicated that each mother did not equally respond to the vaccination.","Duchet-Suchaux, M",Annales de recherches veterinaires.

The Viance Crossing catheter (Covidien) and the CrossBoss catheter (Boston Scientific) are novel devices that facilitate either true lumen or subintimal navigation across CTOs. The purpose of this study was to examine the acute procedural success of these devices for popliteal and below-the-knee (BTK) CTOs. METHODS Clinical and procedural outcome data between Sept 2010 and October 2013 were analyzed from the ongoing multicenter XLPAD registry. Technical success was defined as true lumen passage of the catheter, while procedural success was defined as successful vessel revascularization inclusive of subintimal passage and reentry. RESULTS Twenty-nine patients underwent 31 procedures, in which 37 lesions were treated with the Viance and CrossBoss catheters. Mean age of the group was 69.1 ± 10.7 years and 26 patients were male (90%). All patients (100%) had hypertension, 62% were diabetic, and 48% were active smokers. Critical limb ischemia was the indication for the procedure in 58% of cases; mean Rutherford class was 4.2 ± 1.2 for the entire cohort. Target CTOs included 14 anterior tibial, 9 posterior tibial, 5 peroneal, 1 tibio-peroneal trunk, and 8 popliteal artery lesions. Mean lesion length was 81 ± 64 mm; 15 lesions (41%) were severely calcified. True lumen passage was obtained in 24 lesions (65% technical success). Subintimal entry was achieved in 5 lesions (14%). Procedural success was achieved in 26 lesions (70%). Procedural failure was related to longer lesion length (P<.001), and mean length of failed lesions was 136 ± 65 mm. CONCLUSION Viance and CrossBoss catheters were associated with an overall 70% procedural success with predominantly true lumen crossing in a BTK-CTO cohort. CTO length remains an important determinant of device success.","Sethi, Salil; Mohammad, Atif; Ahmed, S Hinan; Germanwala, Samir; Sarode, Karan; Ortiz-Lopez, Carolina; Banerjee, Subhash; Prasad, Anand",The Journal of invasive cardiology,382,12

A metanalysis published in 2010 shows that LADG is significantly superior to Open Distal Gastrectomy (ODG) if comparing short term outcomes. Oncologic results prove to be comparable to ODG by one RCT and 2 retrospective studies. Little evidence is available on Laparoscopic Total Gastrectomy and concerns are raised about long-term oncologic outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Laparoscopic Subtotal Gastrectomy is carried out with 4 to 5 ports in the periumbilical region (Hasson trocar for laparoscope) and upper quadrants. After exploration of the abdominal cavity surgical steps include coloepiploic detachment, omentectomy, dissection of the gastrocolic ligament, division of the left gastroepiploic vessels, division of right gastroepiploic vessels, division of pyloric vessels. The duodenum is transected with a linear stapler. Incision of the lesser omentum and dissection of the hepatoduodenal ligament allows completion of D2 lymphadenectomy. The 4/5ths of the stomach are transected starting from the greater curve at the junction of left and right gastroepiploic arcades by linear stapler. Roux-en-Y loop reconstruction is performed through a stapled side-to-side gastro-jejunal anastomosis and a side-to-side jejuno-jejunal anastomosis. Reconstruction after Laparoscopic Total Gastrectomy is performed preferably by a side-to-side esophago-jejunal anastomosis according to Orringer.

DESIGN Retrospective questionnaire survey. SETTING The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong. PARTICIPANTS Medical graduates from the University of Hong Kong who graduated between 1997 and 2006 were invited to complete a questionnaire online or in paper form; 1997-2001 graduates were trained under the old curriculum, and 2002-2006 graduates under the new curriculum. RESULTS The response rate was 23%. The survey showed that the graduates of both curricula felt that research skills, population health, and ophthalmology were not emphasised enough in the medical programme. In addition, some graduates of the old curriculum mentioned interpersonal skills, ethics and professionalism, and language skills, which were pinpointed in the curriculum reform in 1997. Some graduates of the new curriculum mentioned anatomy, microbiology, and diagnostic radiology. Graduates of both the old and the new curricula perceived the same top five areas as being lacking in their respective curricula, in relationship to their clinical career and personal growth, namely: business administration, law, professional English, life coaching, and humanities. A small percentage of graduates also took courses in these areas after graduation. CONCLUSIONS The survey showed that the curriculum reform in 1997 at the University of Hong Kong had correctly pinpointed some of the learning needs. The survey also identified educational needs in the existing curriculum that need to be dealt with in the forthcoming curriculum reform in 2012.","Chan, L K; Ip, Mary S M; Patil, N G; Prosser, M",Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,382,1

The large sequencing projects provided the content for detailed expression studies under a variety of stimuli and conditions. The human genome project identified around 30 000 human genes. Estimated number of protein products is, however, 10-30 times higher, mainly due to the alternative splicing and post-translational modifications. The identification of gene functions requires both genomic and proteomic approaches, including protein microarrays, and numerous current microarray projects focus on deciphering gene expression patterns under a variety of conditions. Establishing the key genes and gene products for particular conditions opens the way for diagnostic applications using multiparameter, high-throughput assays. This format can also accommodate existing blood screening assays, potentially providing a single testing platform.

It use therefore creates particularly favorable conditions for mixed infection of gut cells, and indeed intertypic vaccine-derived recombinants (VdRec) have been frequently found in patients with vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis. Nevertheless, there have not been extensive searches for VdRec in healthy vaccinees following immunization with OPV. To determine the incidence of VdRec and their excretion kinetics in primary vaccinees, and to establish the general genomic features of the corresponding recombinant genomes, we characterized poliovirus isolates excreted by vaccinees following primary immunization with OPV. Isolates were collected from 67 children 2 to 60 days following vaccination. Recombinant strains were identified by multiple restriction fragment length polymorphism assays. The localization of junction sites in recombinant genomes was also determined. VdRec excreted by vaccinees were first detected 2 to 4 days after vaccination. The highest rate of recombinants was on day 14. The frequency of VdRec depends strongly on the serotype of the analyzed isolates (2, 53, and 79% of recombinant strains in the last-excreted type 1, 2, and 3 isolates, respectively). Particular associations of genomic segments were preferred in the recombinant genomes, and recombination junctions were found in the genomic region encoding the nonstructural proteins. Recombination junctions generally clustered in particular subgenomic regions that were dependent on the serotype of the isolate and/or on the associations of genomic segments in recombinants. Thus, VdRec are frequently excreted by vaccinees, and the poliovirus replication machinery requirements or selection factors appear to act in vivo to shape the features of the recombinant genomes.","Cuervo, N S; Guillot, S; Romanenkova, N; Combiescu, M; Aubert-Combiescu, A; Seghier, M; Caro, V; Crainic, R; Delpeyroux, F",Journal of virology,382,1

To assess infectivity in an in vitro model of human ciliated airway epithelia (HAE) derived from nasal and tracheobronchial airway regions, we generated recombinant SARS-CoV by deletion of open reading frame 7a/7b (ORF7a/7b) and insertion of the green fluorescent protein (GFP), resulting in SARS-CoV GFP. SARS-CoV GFP replicated to titers similar to those of wild-type viruses in cell lines. SARS-CoV specifically infected HAE via the apical surface and replicated to titers of 10(7) PFU/ml by 48 h postinfection. Polyclonal antisera directed against hACE2 blocked virus infection and replication, suggesting that hACE2 is the primary receptor for SARS-CoV infection of HAE. SARS-CoV structural proteins and virions localized to ciliated epithelial cells. Infection was highly cytolytic, as infected ciliated cells were necrotic and shed over time onto the luminal surface of the epithelium.

Several viral infections such as SARS, MERS, and influenza have been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. The question arises whether pregnant women are at greater risk of complications related to COVID-19 compared to other people What complications should we expect in the fetuses whose mothers were infected? AIMS This review aims to provide a summary of studies on symptoms of COVID-19 and the possible risks of COVID-19 among pregnant women, as well as complications in fetuses and neonates whose mothers were infected with COVID-19. METHODS The included data were provided from Web of Science, Cochrane, PubMed, and Scopus which are extracted from the published studies in English until April 2nd, 2020 that contained data on the risk of COVID-19 in pregnancy. RESULTS The early symptoms of patients with COVID-19 were fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia, and fatigue; while production of sputum, headache, hemoptysis, and diarrhea were other symptoms which were less common. There is no evidence of vertical maternal-fetal transmission in pregnant women with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS The clinical findings in pregnant women with COVID-19 are not significantly different compared to other patients, and pregnant women with COVID-19 are not at a higher risk of developing critical pneumonia compared to non-pregnant women. Although, there has been no sign of vertical infection in infants, but maternal infection can cause serious problems such as preterm labour and fetal distress.","Maleki Dana, Parisa; Kolahdooz, Fariba; Sadoughi, Fatemeh; Moazzami, Bahram; Chaichian, Shahla; Asemi, Zatollah",Le infezioni in medicina,382,4

METHODS Twenty-seven serious cases of SARS undergone NIPPV were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS Pneumothorax and mediastinal emphysema occurred in 7 of 27 serious cases of SARS with NIPPV, and mediastinal emphysema occurred in 1 of 189 cases of SARS without mechanical ventilation (MV). The incidence of pneumothorax and mediastinal emphysema in serious cases of SARS with NIPPV was significantly higher (chi2=25.052, P<0.01) than that in cases of SARS without receiving MV. The peripheral blood oxygen saturation level was not changed significantly after reasonable adjustment of ventilation pressure and increase in oxygen concentration inhaled. Seven cases of pneumothorax and mediastinal emphysema improved gradually. CONCLUSION The incidence of pneumothorax and mediastinal emphysema in serious SARS patients with NIPPV is significantly higher than that in SARS patients without receiving MV. This might be related to SARS related pulmonary injuries, intensive cough and high mechanical ventilation pressure. The pneumothorax and mediastinal emphysema improve gradually in all cases after reasonable adjustment of mechanical ventilative pressure. So when NIPPV is used in the treatment of serious SARS patients to improve hypoxemia, optimized mechanical ventilative pressure should be acquired in order to avoid pneumothorax and mediastinal emphysema.","Yang, Lei; Li, Fei; Li, Duo; Jia, Jian-guo; Yang, Peng; Sun, Jia-bang",Zhongguo wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue = Chinese critical care medicine = Zhongguo weizhongbing jijiuyixue,382,28

This study was undertaken to define the role of NO in MHV-3 infection. Gamma interferon-induced production of NO inhibited growth of MHV-3 in a murine macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7). Viral inhibitory activity was reproduced by the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine (SNAP), whereas N-acetyl-DL-pencillamine (NAP), an inactive analog of SNAP, had no effect. Electron microscopy studies confirmed the inhibitory effects of NO on viral replication. Peritoneal macrophages isolated from A/J mice known to be resistant to MHV-3 produced a fivefold-higher level of NO and higher levels of mRNA transcripts of inducible NO synthase in response to gamma interferon than macrophages from susceptible BALB/cJ mice. SNAP inhibited growth of MHV-3 in macrophages from both strains of mice to similar degrees. In vivo inhibition of NO by N-monomethyl-L-arginine resulted in loss of resistance to MHV-3 in A/J mice. These results collectively demonstrate a defect in the production of NO in macrophages from susceptible BALB/cJ mice and define the importance of endogenous NO in resistance to MHV-3 infection in resistant A/J mice.","Pope, M; Marsden, P A; Cole, E; Sloan, S; Fung, L S; Ning, Q; Ding, J W; Leibowitz, J L; Phillips, M J; Levy, G A",Journal of virology,382,13

However, animal diseases are still a major constraint on economic growth, the reduction of poverty and food security. Among the most significant diseases is foot and mouth disease (FMD), a highly contagious, multi-species animal disease with a devastating impact on national economies and trade. Less obvious is the severe constraint that FMD places on both development and the reduction of poverty in developing countries where this disease is endemic. As a result of its global implications and the high costs that it imposes on society, FMD is an infectious disease whose control and prevention are recognised as being a global public good. Moving towards the global control of FMD should be considered a priority for donors, but will require long-term commitment from all parties, strong political will from governments and concerted financial support from donors. Areas of intervention must fall within the framework of programmes developed by international organisations, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), through the FAO/OIE Global Framework for the Progressive Control of FMD and Other Transboundary Animal Diseases, as well as the disease control programmes of the regions concerned. Such a goal should specifically focus on analytical work (micro-economic impact and cost-benefit analyses of FMD at the household level and on the poor), research, surveillance networks, communication, monitoring and evaluation, and continuous strengthening of Veterinary Services.","Forman, S; Le Gall, F; Belton, D; Evans, B; François, J L; Murray, G; Sheesley, D; Vandersmissen, A; Yoshimura, S",Revue scientifique et technique,382,20

SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-specific CTL responses, in particular their magnitude and duration of postinfection immunity, have not been extensively studied. In this study, we found that heat-inactivated SARS-CoV elicited recall CTL responses to newly identified spike protein-derived epitopes (SSp-1, S978, and S1202) in peripheral blood of all HLA-A*0201(+) recovered SARS patients over 1 year postinfection. Intriguingly, heat-inactivated SARS-CoV elicited recall-like CTL responses to SSp-1 but not to S978, S1202, or dominant epitopes from several other human viruses in 5 of 36 (13.8%) HLA-A*0201(+) healthy donors without any contact history with SARS-CoV. SSp-1-specific CTLs expanded from memory T cells of both recovered SARS patients, and the five exceptional healthy donors shared a differentiated effector CTL phenotype, CD45RA(+)CCR7(-)CD62L(-), and expressed CCR5 and CD44. However, compared with the high avidity of SSp-1-specific CTLs derived from memory T cells of recovered SARS patients, SSp-1-specific CTLs from the five exceptional healthy donors were of low avidity, as determined by their rapid tetramer dissociation kinetics and reduced cytotoxic reactivity, IFN-gamma secretion, and intracellular production of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, perforin, and granzyme A. These results indicate that SARS-CoV infection induces strong and long-lasting CTL-mediated immunity in surviving SARS patients, and that cross-reactive memory T cells to SARS-CoV may exist in the T cell repertoire of a small subset of healthy individuals and can be reactivated by SARS-CoV infection.","Chen, Huabiao; Hou, Jinlin; Jiang, Xiaodong; Ma, Shiwu; Meng, Minjie; Wang, Baomei; Zhang, Minghui; Zhang, Mingxia; Tang, Xiaoping; Zhang, Fuchun; Wan, Tao; Li, Nan; Yu, Yizhi; Hu, Hongbo; Yang, Ruifu; He, Wei; Wang, Xiaoning; Cao, Xuetao",Journal of immunology,382,15

Ozone therapy increases interest in new neuroprotective strategies that may represent therapeutic targets for minimizing the effects of oxidative stress. METHODS The overview examines the latest literature in neurological pathologies treated with ozone therapy as well as our own experience with ozone therapy. The effectiveness of treatments is connected to the ability of ozone therapy to reactivate the antioxidant system to address oxidative stress for chronic neurodegenerative diseases, strokes, and other pathologies. Application options include large and small autohemotherapy, intramuscular application, intra-articular, intradiscal, paravertebral and epidural, non-invasive rectal, transdermal, mucosal, or ozonated oils and ointments. The combination of different types of ozone therapy stimulates the benefits of the effects of ozone. RESULTS Clinical studies on O2-O3 therapy have been shown to be efficient in the treatment of neurological degenerative disorders, multiple sclerosis, cardiovascular, peripheral vascular, orthopedic, gastrointestinal and genitourinary pathologies, fibromyalgia, skin diseases/wound healing, diabetes/ulcers, infectious diseases, and lung diseases, including the pandemic disease caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus. CONCLUSION Ozone therapy is a relatively fast administration of ozone gas. When the correct dose is administered, no side effects occur. Further clinical and experimental studies will be needed to determine the optimal administration schedule and to evaluate the combination of ozone therapy with other therapies to increase the effectiveness of treatment.","Masan, Jan; Sramka, Miron; Rabarova, Daria",Neuro endocrinology letters,382,16

Early dinical signs were increased flock mortality and urinary water loss (polyuria and pollakiuria) leading to wet litter. Daily mortality ranged from 0.01% in layers to 2.45% in broilers, with total broiler mortality as high as 23%. Severe renal swelling and accumulation of urates in the tubules were commonly seen. Visceral gout and urolithiasis were less frequently observed. Histopathologic changes included characteristic tubular epithelial degeneration and sloughing with lymphoplasmacytic interstitial nephritis. Minimal respiratory disease signs were noted in broilers. Egg production and shell quality declined in layers. Confirmatory diagnosis of NIB was made by IBV antigen-specific immunohistochemical staining of the renal tubular epithelium and virus isolation. Sequencing of the S1 subunit gene of 21 IBV isolates showed the NIB outbreak to be associated with two unique genotypes, PA/Wolgemuth/98 and PA/171/99. The cases from which the genotypes were isolated were clinically indistinguishable. The NIB viruses were unrelated to previously recognized endemic strains in Pennsylvania and were also dissimilar to each other. Genotype PA/Wolgemuth/98 was isolated almost exclusively during the first 14 mo of the outbreak, whereas PA/171/99 was recovered during the final 18 mo. The reason for the apparent replacement of PA/Wolgemuth/98 by PA/171/99 is not known.","Ziegler, A F; Ladman, B S; Dunn, P A; Schneider, A; Davison, S; Miller, P G; Lu, H; Weinstock, D; Salem, M; Eckroade, R J; Gelb, J",Avian diseases,382,16

This increase is partly explained by changes in food processing and consumption patterns that lead to the worldwide availability of high-risk food. As a result, vast outbreaks may occur due to contamination of food by a single foodhandler or at a single source. Although there are numerous fecal-orally transmitted viruses, most reports of foodborne transmission describe infections with Norwalk-like caliciviruses (NLV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV), suggesting that these viruses are associated with the greatest risk of foodborne transmission. NLV and HAV can be transmitted from person to person, or indirectly via food, water, or fomites contaminated with virus-containing feces or vomit. People can be infected without showing symptoms. The high frequency of secondary cases of NLV illness and - to a lesser extent - of hepatitis A following a foodborne outbreak results in amplification of the problem. The burden of illness is highest in the elderly, and therefore is likely to increase due to the aging population. For HAV, the burden of illness may increase following hygienic control measures, due to a decreasing population of naturally immune individuals and a concurrent increase in the population at risk. Recent advances in the research of NLV and HAV have led to the development of molecular methods which can be used for molecular tracing of virus strains. These methods can be and have been used for the detection of common source outbreaks. While traditionally certain foods have been implicated in virus outbreaks, it is clear that almost any food item can be involved, provided it has been handled by an infected person. There are no established methods for detection of viruses in foods other than shellfish. Little information is available on disinfection and preventive measures specifically for these viruses. Studies addressing this issue are hampered by the lack of culture systems. As currently available routine monitoring systems exclusively focus on bacterial pathogens, efforts should be made to combine epidemiological and virological information for a combined laboratory-based rapid detection system for foodborne viruses. With better surveillance, including typing information, outbreaks of foodborne infections could be reported faster to prevent further spread.","Koopmans, Marion; von Bonsdorff, Carl Henrik; Vinjé, Jan; de Medici, Dario; Monroe, Steve",FEMS microbiology reviews,382,16

To consider targeting liver/lymph node-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (L-SIGN) for therapeutic purposes in autoimmunity and infectious disease, we isolated and characterized Fabs that bind strongly to L-SIGN, but to a lesser degree or not at all to dendritic cell-specific ICAM-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN). Six Fabs with distinct relative affinities and epitope specificities were characterized. The Fabs and those selected for conversion to IgG were tested for their ability to block ligand (HIV gp120, Ebola gp, and ICAM-3) binding. Receptor internalization upon Fab binding was evaluated on primary human liver sinusoidal endothelial cells by flow cytometry and confirmed by confocal microscopy. Although all six Fabs internalized, three Fabs that showed the most complete blocking of HIVgp120 and ICAM-3 binding to L-SIGN also internalized most efficiently. Differences among the Fab panel in the ability to efficiently block Ebola gp compared with HIVgp120 suggested distinct binding sites. As a first step to consider the potential of these Abs for Ab-mediated Ag delivery, we evaluated specific peptide delivery to human dendritic cells. A durable human T cell response was induced when a tetanus toxide epitope embedded into a L-SIGN/DC-SIGN-cross-reactive Ab was targeted to dendritic cells. We believe that the isolated Abs may be useful for selective delivery of Ags to DC-SIGN- or L-SIGN-bearing APCs for the modulation of immune responses and for blocking viral infections.","Dakappagari, Naveen; Maruyama, Toshiaki; Renshaw, Mark; Tacken, Paul; Figdor, Carl; Torensma, Ruurd; Wild, Martha A; Wu, Dayang; Bowdish, Katherine; Kretz-Rommel, Anke",Journal of immunology,382,16

To achieve the integration of vertical driving force and horizontal driving force, a novel 2- (two degrees-of-freedom) DOF Lorentz force actuator is developed by designing the pose of the windings and permanent magnets (PMs). The structure and the working principle are introduced. The electromagnetic force mathematical model is established by the equivalent magnetic circuit method to analyze the coupling of magnetic flux. The distribution characteristics of magnetic flux density are analyzed by the finite-element method (FEM). It is found that the coupling of the magnetic flux and the large magnetic field gradient severely reduce the uniformity of the air-gap magnetic field. The electromagnetic force characteristic is investigated by FEM and measurement experiments. The difference between FEM and experiment results is within 10%. The reasons of driving force fluctuation are explained based on the distribution of air-gap magnetic field. The actuator performance are compared under the sliding mode control algorithm and PID control algorithm and the positioning accuracy is 20 µm and 15 µm respectively. Compared with the similar configuration, the motion range and force coefficient of the Lorentz force actuator in this paper are larger.

The association between clinical characteristics of the virus and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against this virus have not been well studied. Objective: To examine the association between clinical characteristics and levels of NAbs in patients who recovered from COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cohort study, a total of 175 patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19 who were hospitalized from January 24 to February 26, 2020, were followed up until March 16, 2020, at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai, China. Exposures: SARS-CoV-2 infections were diagnosed and confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal samples. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2-specific NAb titers. Secondary outcomes included spike-binding antibodies, cross-reactivity against SARS-associated CoV, kinetics of NAb development, and clinical information, including age, sex, disease duration, length of stay, lymphocyte counts, and blood C-reactive protein level. Results: Of the 175 patients with COVID-19, 93 were female (53%); the median age was 50 (interquartile range [IQR], 37-63) years. The median length of hospital stay was 16 (IQR, 13-21) days, and the median disease duration was 22 (IQR, 18-26) days. Variable levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs were observed at the time of discharge (50% inhibitory dose [ID50], 1076 [IQR, 448-2048]). There were 10 patients whose NAb titers were less than the detectable level of the assay (ID50, <40), and 2 patients who showed very high titers of NAbs, with ID50 levels of 15 989 and 21 567. NAbs were detected in patients from day 4 to 6 and reached peak levels from day 10 to 15 after disease onset. NAbs were unable to cross-react with SARS-associated CoV and NAb titers correlated with the spike-binding antibodies targeting S1 (r = 0.451; 95% CI, 0.320-0.564; P < .001), receptor binding domain (r = 0.484; 95% CI, 0.358-0.592; P < .001), and S2 regions (r = 0.346; 95% CI, 0.204-0.473; P < .001). NAb titers at the time of discharge were significantly higher in the 82 men (1417 [IQR, 541-2253]) than those in the 93 women (905 [IQR, 371-1687]) (median difference, 512; 95% CI, 82-688; P = .01) and at the time of follow-up in 56 male patients (1049 [IQR, 552-2454]) vs 61 female patients (751 [IQR, 216-1301]) (median difference, 298; 95% CI, 86-732; P = .009). Plasma NAb titers were significantly higher in 56 older (1537 [IQR, 877-2427) and 63 middle-aged (1291 [IQR, 504-2126]) patients than in 56 younger patients (459 [IQR, 225-998]) (older vs younger: median difference, 1078; 95% CI, 548-1287; P < .001; middle-aged vs younger: median difference, 832; 95% CI, 284-1013; P < .001).

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study involving 217 GC inpatients. Nutrition assessment was performed during their hospitalization with both the GLIM criteria and the PG-SGA. Consistency of the assessment results and their correlation with the quality of life in patients were evaluated. RESULTS: A moderate concordance (K = 0.483, P < 0.001) was founded between the two methods for malnutrition diagnosis. Spearman correlation analysis confirmed the significant association (P < 0.05) between most aspects of the quality of life and nutrition status regarding either the GLIM criteria or the PG-SGA. In multivariate linear regression, adjusted for confounding variables, the quality of life was significantly associated with nutrition status by the GLIM criteria (B = 5.63, 95% CI: 0.09-11.16, P = 0.046), and by the PG-SGA (B = 13.53, 95% CI: 7.78-19.27, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a new understanding of the validity of the GLIM criteria in hospitalized GC patients. In the study, we have found that the new GLIM criteria are of concurrent and clinical validity in GC inpatients, suggested by the comparison with the PG-SGA and its correlation with the quality of life.","Qin, Liyuan; Tian, Qiuju; Zhu, Weiyi; Wu, Beiwen",Nutr Cancer,382,5

Objective: The purpose of this study was to gather information about the ability of hospitals in Kenya to provide emergency and critical care services and to identify priority actions for use by policymakers and other stakeholders as a roadmap toward strengthening the COVID-19 response in the country. Methods: This was a comprehensive review of the published and grey literature on emergency and critical care services in Kenya published in the last three years through April 2020. Screening of articles was conducted independently by the authors and the final decision for inclusion was made collaboratively. A total of 15 papers and documents were included in the review.Key recommendations.There is an urgent need to strengthen prehospital emergency care in Kenya by establishing a single toll-free ambulance access number and an integrated public Emergency Medical Services (EMS) system to respond to severe and critical COVID-19 patients in the community and other emergency cases. Functional 24-h emergency departments (EDs) need to be established in all the level 4, 5 and 6 hospitals in the country to ensure these patients receive immediate lifesaving emergency care when they arrive at the hospitals. The EDs should be equipped with pulse oximeters and functioning oxygen systems and have the necessary resources and skills to perform endotracheal intubation to manage COVID-19-induced respiratory distress and hypoxia. Additional intensive care unit (ICU) beds and ventilators are also needed to ensure continuity of care for the critically ill patients seen in the ED. Appropriate practical interventions should be instituted to limit the spread of COVID-19 to healthcare personnel and other patients within the healthcare system. Further research with individual facility levels of assessment around infrastructure and service provision is necessary to more narrowly define areas with significant shortfalls in emergency and critical care services as the number of COVID-19 cases in the country increase.","Wachira, Benjamin W; Mwai, Margarita",,382,16

If the prevalence of the infection continues to grow, this could impact life expectancy. This paper provides first estimates of the potential direct impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on period life expectancy. METHODS: From the estimates of bias-adjusted age-specific infection fatality rates in Hubei (China) and a range of six prevalence rate assumptions ranging from 1% to 70%, we built a discrete-time microsimulation model that simulates the number of people infected by COVID-19, the number dying from it, and the number of deaths from all causes week by week for a period of one year. We applied our simulation to four broad regions: North America and Europe; Latin America and the Caribbean; Southeastern Asia; and sub-Saharan African. For each region, 100,000 individuals per each 5-year age group are simulated. RESULTS: At a 10% COVID-19 prevalence rate, the loss in life expectancy at birth is likely above 1 year in North America and Europe and in Latin America and the Caribbean. In Southeastern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, one year lost in life expectancy corresponds to an infection prevalence of about 15% and 25%, respectively. Given the uncertainty in fatality rates, with a 50% prevalence of COVID-19 infections under 95% prediction intervals, life expectancy would drop by 3 to 9 years in North America and Europe, by 3 to 8 years in Latin America and the Caribbean, by 2 to 7 years in Southeastern Asia, and by 1 to 4 years in sub-Saharan Africa. In all prevalence scenarios, as long as the COVID-19 infection prevalence rate remains below 1 or 2%, COVID-19 would not affect life expectancy in a substantial manner. INTERPRETATION: In regions with relatively high life expectancy, if the infection prevalence threshold exceeds 1 or 2%, the COVID-19 pandemic will break the secular trend of increasing life expectancy, resulting in a decline in period life expectancy. With life expectancy being a key indicator of human development, mortality increase, especially among the vulnerable subgroups of populations, would set a country back on its path of human development.","Marois, Guillaume; Muttarak, Raya; Scherbov, Sergei",PLoS One,382,17

OBJECTIVE: To investigate SARS-CoV-2 case counts across several adult and family homeless shelters in a major metropolitan area. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, community-based surveillance study. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04141917). SETTING: 14 homeless shelters in King County, Washington. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1434 study encounters were done in shelter residents and staff, regardless of symptoms. INTERVENTION: Two strategies were used for SARS-CoV-2 testing: routine surveillance and contact tracing (""surge testing"") events. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome measure was test positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection at shelters, determined by dividing the number of positive cases by the total number of participant encounters, regardless of symptoms. Sociodemographic, clinical, and virologic variables were assessed as correlates of viral positivity. RESULTS: Among 1434 encounters, 29 (2% [95% CI, 1.4% to 2.9%]) cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected across 5 shelters. Most (n = 21 [72.4%]) were detected during surge testing events rather than routine surveillance, and most (n = 21 [72.4% {CI, 52.8% to 87.3%}]) were asymptomatic at the time of sample collection. Persons who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 were more frequently aged 60 years or older than those without SARS-CoV-2 (44.8% vs. 15.9%). Eighty-six percent of persons with positive test results slept in a communal space rather than in a private or shared room. LIMITATION: Selection bias due to voluntary participation and a relatively small case count. CONCLUSION: Active surveillance and surge testing were used to detect multiple cases of asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in homeless shelters. The findings suggest an unmet need for routine viral testing outside of clinical settings for homeless populations.

Due to its subtropical climate, active binational travel, and population of low socioeconomic status, Hidalgo County focused on disease detection activities for the prevention of further transmission. Therefore, Hidalgo County Health and Human Services enacted public health surveillance, reviewed laboratory results, and conducted epidemiological investigations from 2016 to 2018. In 2017, Hidalgo County experienced a locally-acquired outbreak of Zika virus disease, resulting in the highest local mosquito-borne acquisition case count for the year within the United States. This resulted in Hidalgo County reviewing epidemiological data for disease detection and risk areas. With the data review, key outcomes of testing were identified. This included the importance of both RT-PCR and IgM-ELISA/PRNT testing methods. In addition, increased antenatal testing and surveillance also recognized the need of improved disease identification and testing among the general population, especially during localized outbreaks.","Hinojosa, Steven; Alquiza, Alexander; Guerrero, Clarissa; Vanegas, Diana; Tapangan, Niko; Cano, Narda; Olivarez, Eduardo",,382,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: During an outpatient follow-up visit, chest CT, pulmonary function and COVID-19 related symptoms were assessed approximately 10 weeks after diagnosis. Demographics, baseline (time of diagnosis) CT score and blood results were collected from patient files. Association between lung function and clinical characteristics (baseline), blood markers (baseline), chest CT (baseline and follow-up) and symptom score (followup) was analysed. Mann-Whitney U tests and Chi squared tests were used for statistical comparison between subgroups with and without restriction. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Two hundred-twenty subjects were evaluated at a median follow-up of 74±12 (SD) days. Median symptom and median CT score at follow-up were 1(IQR=0- 2) and 2(IQR=0-6) respectively. Forty-six percent of patients had normal lung function, while TLC and TLCO below the lower limit of normal were observed in 38% and 22% of subjects respectively. This restrictive pulmonary impairment was associated with length of hospital stay (8 vs 6 days; p=0.003), admission to the intensive care unit (27% vs 13%;p=0.009), and invasive mechanical ventilation (10% vs 0.7%;p=0.001), but not with symptom score or CT score at baseline and follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Fifty-four percent of COVID-19 survivors had abnormal lung function 10 weeks after diagnosis. Restriction was the most prevalent pulmonary function, with the more critically ill patients being more prone to this condition. Yet, restriction could not be linked with abnormal imaging results or residual symptoms.","Smet, Jelle; Stylemans, Dimitri; Hanon, Shane; Verbanck, Sylvia; Vanderhelst, Eef; Ilsen, Bart",Respir Med,382,16

Despite these variations, some bat SARSr-CoVs can utilize the orthologs of the human SARS-CoV receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for entry. It is speculated that the interaction between bat ACE2 and SARSr-CoV spike proteins drives diversity. Here, we identified a series of R. sinicus ACE2 variants with some polymorphic sites involved in the interaction with the SARS-CoV spike protein. Pseudoviruses or SARSr-CoVs carrying different spike proteins showed different infection efficiencies in cells transiently expressing bat ACE2 variants. Consistent results were observed by binding affinity assays between SARS-CoV and SARSr-CoV spike proteins and receptor molecules from bats and humans. All tested bat SARSr-CoV spike proteins had a higher binding affinity to human ACE2 than to bat ACE2, although they showed a 10-fold lower binding affinity to human ACE2 compared with that of their SARS-CoV counterpart. Structure modeling revealed that the difference in binding affinity between spike and ACE2 might be caused by the alteration of some key residues in the interface of these two molecules. Molecular evolution analysis indicates that some key residues were under positive selection. These results suggest that the SARSr-CoV spike protein and R. sinicus ACE2 may have coevolved over time and experienced selection pressure from each other, triggering the evolutionary arms race dynamics.IMPORTANCE Evolutionary arms race dynamics shape the diversity of viruses and their receptors. Identification of key residues which are involved in interspecies transmission is important to predict potential pathogen spillover from wildlife to humans. Previously, we have identified genetically diverse SARSr-CoVs in Chinese horseshoe bats. Here, we show the highly polymorphic ACE2 in Chinese horseshoe bat populations. These ACE2 variants support SARS-CoV and SARSr-CoV infection but with different binding affinities to different spike proteins. The higher binding affinity of SARSr-CoV spike to human ACE2 suggests that these viruses have the capacity for spillover to humans. The positive selection of residues at the interface between ACE2 and SARSr-CoV spike protein suggests long-term and ongoing coevolutionary dynamics between them. Continued surveillance of this group of viruses in bats is necessary for the prevention of the next SARS-like disease.","Guo, Hua; Hu, Bing-Jie; Yang, Xing-Lou; Zeng, Lei-Ping; Li, Bei; Ouyang, Songying; Shi, Zheng-Li",J. virol,382,24

Both in the general population and in specific subgroups such as infected people or health care workers, studies have reported increased symptoms of anxiety, depression and stress. However, the reactions of individuals with mental disorders to Covid-19 have largely been neglected. The present study therefore aimed to investigate the perceived impact of Covid-19 and its psychological consequences on people with mental disorders. In this online survey, participants were asked to evaluate their disorder-specific symptoms, perceived psychosocial stress and behaviors related to Covid-19 in the current situation and retrospectively before the spread of Covid-19. The study included participants with self-identified generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder and agoraphobia (PA), illness anxiety disorder (IA), social anxiety disorder (SAD), depression (DP), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), eating disorders (ED), schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders (SP), other non-specified mental disorder (other) as well as mentally healthy controls (HC). The results of bayesian parameter estimation suggest that the symptom severity of DP, GAD, IA and BDD has deteriorated as a reaction to Covid-19. Across all mental disorders and HC, self-reported psychosocial stress levels were higher during the outbreak of Covid-19 compared to before. A reduced frequency of social contacts and grocery shopping was found for all participants. People with self-identified mental disorders showed higher personal worries about Covid-19 and a higher fear of contagion with Covid-19 than did HC. According to our findings, Covid-19 may reinforce symptom severity and psychosocial stress in individuals with mental disorders.

Pre-existing disparities in healthcare may be intersecting with COVID-19 outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To explore the relationship between county-level race/ethnic composition and COVID-19 mortality in the state of Texas and determine whether county-level health factors, healthcare access measures, and other demographic characteristics explain this relationship. METHODS: This retrospective study uses county-level case and fatality data obtained from the Texas Department of State Health Services and merged with the 2020 Robert Wood Johnson foundation (RWJF) county health rankings data. The outcome variables were fatalities per 100,000 population. A two-part/hurdle model examined (1) the probability of having a COVID-19 fatality and (2) fatalities per 100,000 population in counties with 1+ fatalities. For both parts of the hurdle model, we examined the impacts of racial and ethnic composition, adjusting for county characteristics and health factors. RESULTS: The odds of having a COVID-19 fatality decreased with a unit increase in the rate of primary care physicians in a county (OR = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.89, 0.99). In the second part of the model, there was a statistically significant increase in COVID-19 fatalities/100,000 population with every 1 % increase in the proportion of Hispanics (ß = 5.41; p = 0.03) and African Americans (ß = 5.08; p value = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Counties with higher rates of minorities, specifically Hispanics and African Americans, have a higher COVID-19 fatality burden.

In this context, how to accurately predict the turning point, duration and final scale of the epidemic in different countries, regions or cities is key to enabling decision makers and public health departments to formulate intervention measures and deploy resources. METHODS: Based on COVID-19 surveillance data and human mobility data, this study predicts the epidemic trends of national and state regional administrative units in the United States from July 27, 2020, to January 22, 2021, by constructing a SIRD model considering the factors of ""lockdown"" and ""riot"". RESULTS: (1) The spread of the epidemic in the USA has the characteristics of geographical proximity. (2) During the lockdown period, there was a strong correlation between the number of COVID-19 infected cases and residents' activities in recreational areas such as parks. (3) The turning point (the point of time in which active infected cases peak) of the early epidemic in the USA was predicted to occur in September. (4) Among the 10 states experiencing the most severe epidemic, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Texas, Illinois, Pennsylvania and California are all predicted to meet the turning point in a concentrated period from July to September, while the turning point in Georgia is forecast to occur in December. No turning points in Florida and Arizona were foreseen for the forecast period, with the number of infected cases still set to be growing rapidly. CONCLUSIONS: The model was found accurately to predict the future trend of the epidemic and can be applied to other countries. It is worth noting that in the early stage there is no vaccine or approved pharmaceutical intervention for this disease, making the fight against the pandemic reliant on non-pharmaceutical interventions. Therefore, reducing mobility, focusing on personal protection and increasing social distance remain still the most effective measures to date.","Zheng, Zhicheng; Xie, Zhixiang; Qin, Yaochen; Wang, Kun; Yu, Yan; Fu, Pinde",BMC Public Health,382,16

Thus, this study aims to describe the changes in mental and physical health, isolation and loneliness, residence and socioeconomic resources in a national cohort of Chilean older adults before and during the COVID-19 outbreak. It also analyzes the changes in depressive symptoms by changes in the other quality of life indicators before and during the COVID-19 outbreak. Possible methodological biases of telephone surveys in older adults living in non-developed countries are also discussed. METHODS: Between June and September 2020, a random subsample of 720 people who had participated in the face-to-face V National Survey on Quality of Life in Older Adults in Chile conducted at the end of 2019 was followed up by telephone. Descriptive bivariate analyses were performed using t-test and non-parametric tests for independent variables, comparing the baseline sample with the current 2020 follow-up sample during the peak of the pandemic outbreak in Latin America. Furthermore, descriptive bivariate analysis through t-test and non-parametric test for paired samples compared the follow-up subsample at baseline with the not-included sample, examining possible biases of the telephone interview compared with the face-to-face interview. RESULTS: In the panel, there was no variation in self-rated health. The health symptoms that worsened were memory, stomach, and mood problems. Depressive symptoms and anxiety increased; similarly, smartphone users, social contacts, intergenerational co-residence and resilience increased. The telephone follow-up sample had a higher educational level and greater smartphone use than those not included in the subsample. CONCLUSIONS: Although some physical and mental health indicators have worsened during the pandemic, older adults mobilized resources that could allow them to maintain their quality of life, such as improved resilience. Thus, these findings can guide future research and the development of efficient strategies to improve these resources among older adults to ensure wellbeing.","Herrera, M Soledad; Elgueta, Raúl; Fernández, M Beatriz; Giacoman, Claudia; Leal, Daniella; Marshall, Pío; Rubio, Miriam; Bustamante, Felipe",BMC Geriatr,382,1

Here, we try to explain its biological behavior based on our recent autopsy information and review of literature. METHODS: In this study, patients with a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) result were considered eligible for enrollment. Histopathological examinations were done on 13 people who were hospitalized in Afzalipour hospital, Kerman, Iran. Clinical and laboratory data were reviewed. Tissue examination was done by light microscopy, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. RESULTS: The most frequent co-morbidity in the patients was cardiovascular disease. The common initial symptoms of COVID-19 infection were dyspnea and cough. In all cases, the number of white blood cells was higher than the normal range. Common histopathological findings were variable degrees of vasculitis as degenerative to necrotic changes of endothelium and trafficking of inflammatory cells in the vessel wall with fibrinoid necrosis. Tissue damage included interstitial acute inflammatory cells reaction with degenerative to necrotic changes of the parenchymal cells. CD34 and Factor VIII immunohistochemistry staining showed endothelial cell degeneration to necrosis at the vessel wall and infiltration by inflammatory cells. Electron microscopic features confirmed the degenerative damages in the endothelial cells. CONCLUSION: Our histopathological studies suggest that the main focus of the viral damage is the endothelial cells (endotheliopathica) in involved organs. Also, our findings suggest that degeneration of leukocytes occurs at the site of inflammation and release of cytokines (leukocytoclastica) resulting in a cytokine storm.","Bahadori, Moslem; Dabiri, Shahriar; Javadi, Abdolreza; Shamsi Meymandi, Simin; Movahedinia, Sajjadeh; Shamsi Meymandi, Manzumeh; Khorasani, Parisa; Farrokhnia, Mehrdad; Yousefi, Meysam; Sarrafzadeh, Farhad; Abosaidi, Hamid; Shojaeepour, Saeedeh; Mortazaizadeh, Abbas; Rezaei, Mitra; Dabiri, Bahram; Mohabati, Nader; Ranjbar, Hanie; Rashidinejad, Sara; Feizy, Abdolamir",Arch Iran Med,382,1

A mouse model of stroke (middle cerebral artery occlusion; MCAO) was used to test the hypothesis that exposure to dim light at night impairs responses to a major insult. Stroke lesion size was substantially larger among animals housed in dLAN after reperfusion than animals maintained in dark nights. Mice housed in dLAN for three days after the stroke displayed increased post-stroke anxiety-like behavior. Overall, dLAN amplified pro-inflammatory pathways in the CNS, which may have exacerbated neuronal damage.

To this end, we propose two means for representing spatial mobility profiles and clustering travellers accordingly. We represent users patterns in terms of zonal visiting frequency profiles and grid-cells spatial extent heatmaps. We apply the proposed analysis to a large-scale multi-modal mobility data set from the public transport system in Stockholm, Sweden. We unravel three clusters - locals, commuters and explorers - that best describe the zonal visiting frequency and show that their composition varies considerably across users' place of residence and related demographics.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 infection (study group)(n = 90) were prospectively compared to a gestational age-matched control group of pregnant women without any defined risk factors (n = 90). Demographic features, clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, interferon-gamma (IFN Î³), interleukin (IL-2), IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17 levels were compared between the groups. Additionally, a correlation analysis was performed in the study group for the assessment of IFN Î³, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17 levels with disease severity and CRP levels. RESULTS: Study group had significantly higher pregnancy complication rate, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, IFN Î³, and IL-6 values (p < 0.05). On the other hand, the control group had significantly higher hemoglobin, leukocyte, platelet, lymphocyte, IL-2, IL-10, and IL-17 values (p < 0.05). Statistically significant differences were found between the groups for IFN Î³, IL-2, IL-10, and IL-17 values between the trimesters (p < 0.05). Statistically significant positive correlations were found for IFN Î³ and IL-6 with disease severity (r = 0.41 and p < 0.001 for IFN Î³ and r = 0.58 and p < 0.001 for IL-6). On the other hand, a moderate negative correlation for IL-2 and a weak negative correlation for IL-10 were present (r = -0.62 and p < 0.001 for IL-2 and r = -0.19 and p = 0.01 for IL-10). A statistically significant positive moderate correlation was found between IL-6 and CRP (r = 0.40 and p < 0.001) CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection seems to have an impact on the cytokine profile of pregnant women varying according to pregnancy trimesters and cytokine levels seem to be correlated with disease severity.","Tanacan, Atakan; Yazihan, Nuray; Erol, Seyit Ahmet; Anuk, Ali Taner; Yucel Yetiskin, Fatma Didem; Biriken, Derya; Ozgu-Erdinc, A Seval; Keskin, Huseyin Levent; Moraloglu Tekin, Ozlem; Sahin, Dilek",Cytokine,382,33

(https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). We have chosen India as a prototype for the analysis of morbidity and mortality rates to learn about the principles and practices for achieving minimum causality under the most complex practical scenario. The State of Goa where 5 cases / 100,000 with no death reported as of May 25, 2020, 8:21 A.M. At the time of the data analysis, India was on 62nd day of lockdown. Based on the data available at this time, here we present an inverse correlation of decreased morbidity and mortality rate with increased social distancing, stay-home program / shelter-in program administered by Indian authorities. It is intriguing that a population of approximately 1.3 billion people, reporting a minimum morbidity and mortality rate (M&M rate) could be an exceptional example of coordination of incredibly diverse cultural and complex administrative fabric. In all, our hypothesis is that it is the herd immunity conferred the protection for an en masse from the current pandemic event. Based on the lessons learned from this current SARS-CoV-2, here we present a ?Cogent Transmission Model? (CTM) in which community living confer and/or reinforce herd immunity induced protection from the future pandemic of infectious diseases caused by antibiotic resistance bacterial pathogens (ARBP). The success in sustaining a minimum M&M rate could be due in part by the social support system which is a significant element for the development of hardiness to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. The success of the current lockdown is a reflection of the social support system which is intertwined with perceptions of personal control enabling the coping process. Such a level of hardiness is also referred to as ?Internal Locus of Control? (ILC). It is our observation that a pattern of consistency on the confidence level of each and every member of the community having considerable control over the events in overcoming the illness and combating the diseases is truly flabbergasting. Such a level of resilience draws a corollary of the hardy personality as identified in the ?Personal Hardiness? (J. Pers and Soci. Psych 37, 1?11: 1979). Traits such as a. sense of commitment to self, b. control over their life at the individual level and c. view and make adjustments as challenges arise rather than viewing it as a source of stress. Taken together we suggest that commitment to self, control of self in dynamic social environmental circumstances and readjustment to challenges separate the people with ?Personal Hardiness? from the rest of the society as a remarkable trait to overcome the fear of the unknown in a pandemic event (FASEB Journal 2019 33:1_supplement, 483.16-483.16). It would be a dream come true, should the principles of ?Personal Hardiness? disseminated across the globe at all socioeconomic levels in every nook and corner at the earliest possible time, it would definitely vanquish the plausible pandemic of infectious diseases at its blossom.","Jauregui, Lizette Moreno Bernice Nunez Hector Kannan Subburaj",The FASEB Journal,382,2

We present case volume data from our community hospital to demonstrate how this shutdown affected surgical care. METHODS: Between March 16 and June 14, 2020, all elective surgeries were canceled at our institution. All procedures performed during this operating room shutdown (ORS) were logged, as well as those 4 weeks before (PRE) and 4 weeks after (POST) for comparison. RESULTS: A total of 2,475 cases were included in our analysis, with 754 occurring during shutdown. Overall case numbers dropped significantly during ORS and increased during recovery (mean 245.0 ± 28.4 PRE versus 58.0 ± 30.9 ORS versus 186.0±19.4 POST cases/wk, P< 0.001). Emergency cases predominated during ORS (26.4% PRE versus 59.3% ORS versus 31.5% POST, P< 0.001) despite decreasing in frequency (mean 64.5 ± 7.9 PRE versus 34.4 ± 12.1 ORS versus 58.5 ± 4.0 POST cases/wk, P< 0.001).

The purpose of the current article was to assess the populations' perception of DTCOs and to examine various factors that may influence their decision in choosing treatment with DTCO products. METHODS: A cross-sectional population-based survey was conducted in the United States. The 35-question survey was disseminated through Amazon Mechanical Turk (Amazon.com, Inc, Seattle, Wash), and participants were asked questions about their demographics, their perceptions of DTCOs, orthodontists, and factors that may influence their decision should they decide to pursue orthodontic treatment. Pearson's correlations were conducted to assess the association between various factors and the participants' likelihood to choose DTCO products. RESULTS: A total of 1441 subjects participated in the study. More than 83% of the participants have considered pursuing orthodontic treatment to some extent. Twenty-three percent reported that they would highly likely choose DTCO products. The majority of participants reported convenience to be the greatest benefit of DTCOs, followed by cost. The majority of responses seemed to favor DTCOs. Forty-seven percent reported that the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic did not affect their preference, whereas 26.6% reported to be more likely to pursue DTCOs because of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of participants seemed to perceive DTCOs as a viable alternative for seeking orthodontic care. Although participants had concerns about the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, results showed that the pandemic might not significantly affect the preferences. Orthodontists and their constituent organizations may consider more robust awareness and advocacy campaigns to educate the population about orthodontic treatment and the benefits of pursuing treatment with a trained orthodontist.","Bous, Rany M; Apostolopoulos, Konstantinos; Valiathan, Manish",Am J Orthod Dentofacial Orthop,382,26

MATERIAL AND METHODS: 455 contacts who were exposed to the asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carrier became the subjects of our research. They were divided into three groups: 35 patients, 196 family members and 224 hospital staffs. We extracted their epidemiological information, clinical records, auxiliary examination results and therapeutic schedules. RESULTS: The median contact time for patients was four days and that for family members was five days. Cardiovascular disease accounted for 25% among original diseases of patients. Apart from hospital staffs, both patients and family members were isolated medically. During the quarantine, seven patients plus one family member appeared new respiratory symptoms, where fever was the most common one. The blood counts in most contacts were within a normal range. All CT images showed no sign of COVID-19 infection. No severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections was detected in 455 contacts by nucleic acid test. CONCLUSION: In summary, all the 455 contacts were excluded from SARS-CoV-2 infection and we conclude that the infectivity of some asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers might be weak.","Gao, Ming; Yang, Lihui; Chen, Xuefu; Deng, Yiyu; Yang, Shifang; Xu, Hanyi; Chen, Zixing; Gao, Xinglin",Respir Med,382,16

OBJECTIVES: To identify factors influencing pharmacologic anticoagulation initiation after spine surgery based on the AOSpine Anticoagulation Global Survey. METHODS: This survey was distributed to the international membership of AOSpine (n = 3805). A Likert-type scale described grade practice-specific factors on a scale from low (1) to high (5) importance, and patient-specific factors a scale from low (0) to high (3) importance. Analysis was performed to determine which factors were significant in the decision making surrounding the initiation of pharmacologic anticoagulation. RESULTS: A total of 316 spine surgeons from 64 countries completed the survey. In terms of practice-specific factors considered to initiate treatment, expert opinion was graded the highest (mean grade ± SD = 3.2 ± 1.3), followed by fellowship training (3.2 ± 1.3). Conversely, previous studies (2.7 ± 1.2) and unspecified guidelines were considered least important (2.6 ± 1.6). Patient body mass index (2.0 ± 1.0) and postoperative mobilization (2.3 ± 1.0) were deemed most important and graded highly overall. Those who rated estimated blood loss with greater importance in anticoagulation initiation decision making were more likely to administer thromboprophylaxis at later times (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.68-0.71), while those who rated drain output with greater importance were likely to administer thromboprophylaxis at earlier times (HR = 1.32-1.43). CONCLUSION: Among our global cohort of spine surgeons, certain patient factors (ie, patient mobilization and body mass index) and practice-specific factors (ie, expert opinion and fellowship training) were considered to be most important when considering anticoagulation start times.","Gandhi, Sapan D; Khanna, Krishn; Harada, Garrett; Louie, Philip; Harrop, James; Mroz, Thomas; Al-Saleh, Khalid; Brodano, Giovanni Barbanti; Chapman, Jens; Fehlings, Michael G; Hu, Serena S; Kawaguchi, Yoshiharu; Mayer, Michael; Menon, Venugopal; Park, Jong-Beom; Rajasekaran, Shanmuganathan; Valacco, Marcelo; Vialle, Luiz; Wang, Jeffrey C; Wiechert, Karsten; Riew, K Daniel; Samartzis, Dino",Global Spine J,382,27

It highlighted the anticipatory and adaptive strategies implemented by institutions, teams and individuals. The most frequently cited problematic situations involved organisational changes, interpersonal conflicts and workloads. In addition to the numerous top-down measures implemented by institutions, respondents also identified personal or team regulation strategies such as increasing staff flexibility, prioritising tasks, interprofessional collaboration, peer support or creating new communication channels to families.

COVID-19-related risk perception and knowledge may influence protective behaviour, and education could be an important determinant. The current study investigated differences by education level in risk perception, knowledge and protective behaviour regarding COVID-19 in Germany, exploring the development of the pandemic over time. The COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring study is a repeated cross-sectional online survey conducted during the pandemic in Germany from 3 March 2020 (waves 1-28: 27,957 participants aged 18-74). Differences in risk perception, knowledge and protective behaviour according to education level (high versus low) were analysed using linear and logistic regression. Time trends were accounted for by interaction terms for education level and calendar week. Regarding protective behaviour, interaction terms were tested for all risk perception and knowledge variables with education level. The strongest associations with education level were evident for perceived and factual knowledge regarding COVID-19. Moreover, associations were found between low education level and higher perceived severity, and between low education level and lower perceived probability. Highly educated men were more worried about COVID-19 than those with low levels of education. No educational differences were observed for perceived susceptibility or fear. Higher compliance with hand washing was found in highly educated women, and higher compliance with maintaining distance was found in highly educated men. Regarding maintaining distance, the impact of perceived severity differed between education groups. In men, significant moderation effects of education level on the association between factual knowledge and all three protective behaviours were found. During the pandemic, risk perception and protective behaviour varied greatly over time. Overall, differences by education level were relatively small. For risk communication, reaching all population groups irrespective of education level is critical.","Rattay, Petra; Michalski, Niels; Domanska, Olga Maria; Kaltwasser, Anna; De Bock, Freia; Wieler, Lothar H; Jordan, Susanne",PLoS One,382,1

Negative reinforcement models of substance use posit that elevations in stress from the COVID-19 pandemic will elicit a corresponding motivation to downregulate COVID-19-related stress reactivity via substance use for a subset of the population. The current study sought to evaluate: (1) if COVID-19-related worry and fear were associated with substance use coping motives; and (2) how levels of COVID-19-related worry and fear differ between pre-COVID-19 substance users, COVID-19 substance initiators, and abstainers. Participants were 160 adults recruited nationally between April-May 2020 for an online study. Results indicated that COVID-19-related worry was associated with substance use coping motives. Additionally, compared to abstainers, pre-COVID-19 substance users and COVID-19 substance initiators demonstrated the highest levels of worry and fear. Examination of differences suggested that the COVID-19 substance initiators had the highest COVID-19-related worry and fear for all substances except for opioids, with effect size estimates ranging from small to medium.

The conventional methods of disease-spread modeling, compartmental models, are based on the assumption of spatiotemporal homogeneity of the spread of the virus, which may cause forecasting to underperform, especially at high spatial resolutions. In this paper we approach the forecasting task with an alternative technique - spatiotemporal machine learning. We present COVID-LSTM, a data-driven model based on a Long Short-term Memory deep learning architecture for forecasting COVID-19 incidence at the county-level in the US. We use the weekly number of new positive cases as temporal input, and hand-engineered spatial features from Facebook movement and connectedness datasets to capture the spread of the disease in time and space. COVID-LSTM outperforms the COVID-19 Forecast Hub's Ensemble model (COVIDhub-ensemble) on our 17-week evaluation period, making it the first model to be more accurate than the COVIDhub-ensemble over one or more forecast periods. Over the 4-week forecast horizon, our model is on average 50 cases per county more accurate than the COVIDhub-ensemble. We highlight that the underutilization of data-driven forecasting of disease spread prior to COVID-19 is likely due to the lack of sufficient data available for previous diseases, in addition to the recent advances in machine learning methods for spatiotemporal forecasting. We discuss the impediments to the wider uptake of data-driven forecasting, and whether it is likely that more deep learning-based models will be used in the future.","Lucas, Benjamin; Vahedi, Behzad; Karimzadeh, Morteza",,382,29

The mean ± SD of restraint, emotional and external eating was 2.5 ± 0.79, 2.1 ± 0.81 and 2.6 ± 0.65 in Spain, whereas 2.7 ± 0.85, 2.3 ± 0.99 and 2.9 ± 0.74 in Greece. Spanish participants had lower average scores of restraint and external eating compared to Greek participants (p < .001), but no difference was seen for emotional eating. In Spain, 13.6%, and 12.3% of the survey respondents reported moderate to severe depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively, whereas in Greece the respective values were 18.8 and 13.2%. After adjusting for several risk factors, a higher prevalence of anxiety symptoms was observed in Spain compared to Greece (p = .001), but no difference was seen for depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated high scores of inappropriate eating behaviours and a high frequency of depressive and anxiety symptoms in two Mediterranean countries during the COVID-19 outbreak. Our findings revealed that compared to Greek participants, Spanish participants, that faced more severe COVID-19 pandemic and stricter lockdown measures, were associated with lower restraint and external eating and increased anxiety symptoms, but not with depressive symptoms or emotional eating.","Papandreou, Christopher; Arija, Victoria; Aretouli, Eleni; Tsilidis, Konstantinos K; Bulló, Mònica",,382,8

These analyses are strongly guided by the input of an epidemiological model as well as sequence data that must contain sufficient intersequence variability in order to be informative. These criteria, however, may not be met during the early stages of an outbreak. Here we investigate the impact of low diversity sequence data on phylodynamic inference using the birth-death and coalescent exponential models. Through our simulation study, estimating the molecular evolutionary rate required enough sequence diversity and is an essential first step for any phylodynamic inference. Following this, the birth-death model outperforms the coalescent exponential model in estimating epidemiological parameters, when faced with low diversity sequence data due to explicitly exploiting the sampling times. In contrast, the coalescent model requires additional samples and therefore variability in sequence data before accurate estimates can be obtained. These findings were also supported through our empirical data analyses of an Australian and a New Zealand cluster outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, the birth-death model is more robust when applied to datasets with low sequence diversity given sampling is specified and this should be considered for future viral outbreak investigations.","Lam, Anthony; Duchene, Sebastian",Viruses,382,13

Severe COVID-19 and uremia are risk factors for neurological complications. However, the lack of insight into their pathogenesis, particularly with respect to the role of the cytokine release syndrome (CRS), is currently hampering effective therapeutic interventions. The aims of this study were to describe the neurological manifestations of patients with COVID-19 and to gain pathophysiological insights with respect to CRS. METHODS: In this longitudinal study, we performed extensive clinical, laboratory and imaging phenotyping in five patients admitted to our renal unit. RESULTS: Neurological presentation included confusion, tremor, cerebellar ataxia, behavioral alterations, aphasia, pyramidal syndrome, coma, cranial nerve palsy, dysautonomia, and central hypothyroidism. Notably, neurological disturbances were accompanied by laboratory evidence of CRS. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was undetectable in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Hyperalbuminorrachia and increased levels of the astroglial protein S100B were suggestive of blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. Brain magnetic resonance imaging findings comprised evidence of acute leukoencephalitis (n = 3, one of whom had a hemorrhagic form), cytotoxic edema mimicking ischaemic stroke (n = 1), or normal results (n = 2). Treatment with corticosteroids and/or intravenous immunoglobulins was attempted, resulting in rapid recovery from neurological disturbances in two cases. SARS-CoV2 was undetectable in 88 of the 90 patients with COVID-19 who underwent Reverse Transcription-PCR testing of CSF. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 can develop neurological manifestations that share clinical, laboratory and imaging similarities with those of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell-related encephalopathy. The pathophysiological underpinnings appear to involve CRS, endothelial activation, BBB dysfunction, and immune-mediated mechanisms.","Perrin, P; Collongues, N; Baloglu, S; Bedo, D; Bassand, X; Lavaux, T; Gautier-Vargas, G; Keller, N; Kremer, S; Fafi-Kremer, S; Moulin, B; Benotmane, I; Caillard, S",Eur. j. neurol,382,16

We aimed to clarify the clinical significance of hematologic parameters alteration in COVID-19. Methods: Different hematologic parameters were measured in 225 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in a tertiary care university hospital, during the peak of COVID-19 outbreak and their association with duration of hospitalization, ICU admission and especially mortality was analyzed. Results: Among a total of 225 patients, 24.4% did not survive after admission. Lymphopenia and neutrophilia were observed in 52.7% and 21.4% of the patients, respectively. The mean count of neutrophils was significantly higher in non-survived patients (P = .032). Elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was significantly associated with mortality (P < .001). Low hemoglobin (Hb) concentration significantly correlated with mortality (P = .004) and ICU admission (P = .04). Platelet (Plt) count was significantly lower in the non-survived patients (P = .023). Non-survivors had significantly lower nadir Hb and Plt counts than survivors (P < .001 in both parameters). Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) also correlated with mortality and was significantly higher in non-survivors (P = .034). Conclusions: Hematologic laboratory parameters have always been a crucial component of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in infectious disease. Hematologic predictors of a fatal outcome in COVID19 hospitalized patients in our series include elevated NLR and PLR, lower than normal Hb and Plt, elevated d-dimer and prolonged prothrombin time (PT), together with elevated inflammatory indicators in the blood.","Mousavi, Seied Asadollah; Rad, Soroush; Rostami, Tahereh; Rostami, Mohammadreza; Mousavi, Seyed Ali; Mirhoseini, Seied Amirhosein; Kiumarsi, Azadeh",Hematology,382,1

Impaired pancreatic function may also result in increased gastric acidity, leading in turn to heartburn, peptic ulcers and the impairment of oral pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. The administration of gastric acid-reducing agents has been used as an adjunct to pancreatic enzyme therapy to improve absorption of fat and gastro-intestinal symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis. It is important to establish the evidence regarding potential benefits of drugs that reduce gastric acidity in people with cystic fibrosis. This is an update of a previously published review. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of drug therapies for reducing gastric acidity for: nutritional status; symptoms associated with increased gastric acidity; fat absorption; lung function; quality of life and survival; and to determine if any adverse effects are associated with their use. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic and non-electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals, abstract books and conference proceedings. Both authors double checked the reference lists of the searches Most recent search of the Group's Trials Register: 26 April 2021. On the 26 April 2021 further searches were conducted on the clinicaltrials.gov register to identify any ongoing trials that may be of relevance. The WHO ICTRP database was last searched in 2020 and is not currently available for searching due to the Covid-19 pandemic. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised and quasi-randomised trials involving agents that reduce gastric acidity compared to placebo or a comparator treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Both authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: The searches identified 40 trials; 17 of these, with 273 participants, were suitable for inclusion, but the number of trials assessing each of the different agents was small. Seven trials were limited to children and four trials enrolled only adults. Meta-analysis was not performed, 14 trials were of a cross-over design and we did not have the appropriate information to conduct comprehensive meta-analyses. All the trials were run in single centres and duration ranged from five days to six months. The included trials were generally not reported adequately enough to allow judgements on risk of bias. However, one trial found that drug therapies that reduce gastric acidity improved gastro-intestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain; seven trials reported significant improvement in measures of fat malabsorption; and two trials reported no significant improvement in nutritional status. Only one trial reported measures of respiratory function and one trial reported an adverse effect with prostaglandin E2 analogue misoprostol. No trials have been identified assessing the effectiveness of these agents in improving quality of life, the complications of increased gastric acidity, or survival. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Trials have shown limited evidence that agents that reduce gastric acidity are associated with improvement in gastro-intestinal symptoms and fat absorption. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to indicate whether there is an improvement in nutritional status, lung function, quality of life, or survival. Furthermore, due to the unclear risks of bias in the included trials, we are unable to make firm conclusions based on the evidence reported therein. We therefore recommend that large, multicentre, randomised controlled clinical trials are undertaken to evaluate these interventions.","Ng, Sze May; Moore, Helen S",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,382,15

This study was conducted to investigate whether proximity to railway stations, a proxy for utilization, was associated with higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection across small-areas of the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (Portugal). Methods: The number of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infections from March 2 until July 5, 2020 at the parish-level was obtained from the National Epidemiological Surveillance System. A Geographic Information System was used to estimate proximity to railway stations of the six railway lines operating in the area. A quasi-Poisson generalized linear regression model was fitted to estimate the relative risks (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Results: Between May 2 and July 5, 2020, there were a total of 17,168 SARS-CoV-2 infections in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, with wide disparities between parishes. Overall, parishes near any of the railway stations of the Sintra line presented significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 infection rates (RR = 1.42, 95%CI 1.16, 1.75) compared to parishes located farther away from railway stations, while the opposite was observed for parishes near other railway stations (Sado and Fertagus lines), where infection rates were significantly lower than those observed in parishes located farther away from railway stations (RR = 0.66, 95%CI 0.50, 0.87). The associations varied according to the stage of the epidemic and to the mitigation measures enforced. Regression results also revealed an increasing influence of socioeconomic deprivation on SARS-CoV-2 infections. Conclusions: No consistent association between proximity to railway stations and SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in the most affected metropolitan area of Portugal was observed, suggesting that other factors (e.g., socioeconomic deprivation) may play a more prominent role in the epidemic dynamics.","Severo, Milton; Ribeiro, Ana Isabel; Lucas, Raquel; Leão, Teresa; Barros, Henrique",Front Public Health,382,10

We sought to evaluate whether patients with AICID who have confirmed COVID-19 presenting to the hospital are at higher risk of adverse outcomes compared with those patients without AICID who are infected with COVID-19 and whether immunosuppressive medications impact this risk. METHODS: We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study with patients presenting to five hospitals in a large academic health system with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 infection. We evaluated the impact of having an AICID and class of immunosuppressive medication being used to treat patients with AICID (biologics, nonbiologic immunosuppressives, or systemic corticosteroids) on the risk of developing severe COVID-19 defined as requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) and/or death. RESULTS: A total of 6792 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included in the study, with 159 (2.3%) having at least one AICID. On multivariable analysis, AICIDs were not significantly associated with severe COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.9-1.8). Among patients with AICID, use of biologics or nonbiologic immunosuppressives did not increase the risk of severe COVID-19. In contrast, systemic corticosteroid use was significantly associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19 (aOR 6.8, 95% CI: 2.5-18.4). CONCLUSION: Patients with AICID are not at increased risk of severe COVID-19 with the exception of those on corticosteroids. These data suggest that patients with AICID should continue on biologic and nonbiologic immunosuppression but limit steroids during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ungaro, Ryan C; Agrawal, Manasi; Park, Sarah; Hirten, Robert; Colombel, Jean-Frederic; Twyman, Kathryn; Gulko, Percio S; Klang, Eyal",,382,6

It is found that although the topology of CAN remains steady during the past several years, there are many dynamic switchings inside the network, which changes the relative relevance of airports and airlines. Moreover, we investigate the evolution of traffic flow (passengers and cargoes) on CAN. It is found that the traffic keeps growing in an exponential form and it has evident seasonal fluctuations. We also found that cargo traffic and passenger traffic are positively related but the correlations are quite different for different kinds of cities.","Zhang, Jun; Cao, Xian-Bin; Du, Wen-Bo; Cai, Kai-Quan",,382,16

Libraries and librarianship are also facing the urgency of a 'paradigm shift', due to the wear and tear of the 'public library' concept and model. This essay tries to deal with both librarianship and library crisis highlighting the accelerator role played by the pandemic. In particular, the tendency to wait and see, which in some cases has 'infected' the library field, is critically analysed. As if the difficult situation and global vulnerability justified a loss of essentiality of library services, a renunciation of activism, a retreat to ordinary administration. On the contrary, the 'livingtogether-library', outlined in the last part of the article, chooses the path of active and proactive intervention during the pandemic. This idea enters in the daily dimension with empathy and respect and works on the hypothesis of a politics of reading as 'motor for change'.","Ferrieri, Luca",AIB Studi,382,9

The dataset contained fake posts, articles and news gathered from fact checking websites like politifact whereas real tweets were taken from verified twitter handles. We incorporated multiple conventional classification techniques like Naive Bayes, KNN, Gradient Boost and Random Forest along with Deep learning approaches, specifically CNN, RNN, DNN and the ensemble model RMDL.

The number of deaths associated with COVID-19 is often used as a key indicator for the size of the epidemic, but the observed number of deaths represents only a minority of all infections1,2. In addition, the heterogeneous burdens in nursing homes and the variable reporting of deaths of older individuals can hinder direct comparisons of mortality rates and the underlying levels of transmission across countries3. Here we use age-specific COVID-19-associated death data from 45 countries and the results of 22 seroprevalence studies to investigate the consistency of infection and fatality patterns across multiple countries. We find that the age distribution of deaths in younger age groups (less than 65 years of age) is very consistent across different settings and demonstrate how these data can provide robust estimates of the share of the population that has been infected. We estimate that the infection fatality ratio is lowest among 5-9-year-old children, with a log-linear increase by age among individuals older than 30 years. Population age structures and heterogeneous burdens in nursing homes explain some but not all of the heterogeneity between countries in infection fatality ratios. Among the 45 countries included in our analysis, we estimate that approximately 5% of these populations had been infected by 1 September 2020, and that much higher transmission rates have probably occurred in a number of Latin American countries. This simple modelling framework can help countries to assess the progression of the pandemic and can be applied in any scenario for which reliable age-specific death data are available.","O039,; Driscoll, Megan; Ribeiro Dos Santos, Gabriel; Wang, Lin; Cummings, Derek A T; Azman, Andrew S; Paireau, Juliette; Fontanet, Arnaud; Cauchemez, Simon; Salje, Henrik",Nature (Lond.),382,10

The oxidative deamination produces several harmful side products like ammonia, peroxides, and aldehydes during the biochemical reaction. The concentration of biochemical neurotransmitter alteration in the brain by MAO is directly related with several neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (PD). Activated MAO also contributes to the amyloid beta (Aß) aggregation by two successive cleft ß-secretase and Î³-secretase of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Additionally, activated MAO is also involved in aggregation of neurofibrillary tangles and cognitive destruction through the cholinergic neuronal damage and disorder of the cholinergic system. MAO inhibition has general anti-Alzheimer's disease effect as a consequence of oxidative stress reduction prompted by MAO enzymes. In this review, we outlined and addressed recent understanding on MAO enzymes such as their structure, physiological function, catalytic mechanism, and possible therapeutic goals in AD.

PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient is a 51-year-old male presented with thick, disfiguring elephant-like erythematous skin folds over the forehead, papular shiny eruptions over ears and trunk and waxy erythematous papules over arms and hands without dysphagia or respiratory or neurologic symptoms DIAGNOSIS: : Skin biopsy from right arm was consistent with scleromyxedema. Serum cryoglobulin was reported negative. Complete blood count and routine blood biochemistry were normal. Thyroid function tests were normal. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation showed monoclonal band of 14.5âg/L typed as IgG lambda. INTERVENTIONS: Our patient was refractory to lenalidomide however improved clinically on immunoglobulins infusions on monthly basis without change in the MGUS level. OUTCOMES: NGF analysis revealed approximately 0.25% Lambda monotypic plasma cells in the bone marrow expressing CD38, CD138, and CD27 with aberrant expression of CD56 and were negative for CD45, CD19, CD117, and CD81. We also detected 0.002% circulating plasma cells (PCs) in peripheral blood. CONCLUSION: The immunophenotype of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) remain close to the malignant PCs phenotype in the BM.

It is unknown if this negative influence relies on the increased risk of AR or the DGF itself. The different Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) values may also play a role in this interaction. METHODS: Retrospective study aimed to evaluate the impact of DGF on graft function and graft survival in a subset of KT recipients (2004-2017). We also analyzed the relationship between KDPI and DGF. RESULTS: The study includes601 KT,226of them (37%) developed DGF. Graft survival was lower in patients with DGF compared with non-DGF patients. Multivariable analysis revealed DGF as risk factor for graft loss, independently of the presence or not of acute rejection. Between DGF patients we observed poorer graft survival in patients with higher KDPI value (>85%).We observed a trend of a greater impact of KDPI in patients with DGF, although this interaction was not statistically significant. Additionally, we observed poorer 12-month graft function in DGF patients. CONCLUSION: DGF is related to poorer graft survival independently of the developed of acute rejection. This negative impact might be influenced by high KDPI values.","Arias-Cabrales, Carlos E; Pérez-Sáez, María José; Redondo-Pachón, Dolores; Buxeda, Anna; Burballa, Carla; Duran, Xavier; Mir, Marisa; Crespo, Marta; Pascual, Julio",Transplant. int,382,24

One key characteristic of such systems is that certain physics laws -- represented as ordinary/partial differential equations (ODEs/PDEs) -- largely dominate the whole process, irrespective of time or location. Physics-informed learning has recently emerged to learn physics for accurate prediction, but they often lack a mechanism to leverage localized spatial and temporal correlation or rely on hard-coded physics parameters. In this paper, we advocate a physics-coupled neural network model to learn parameters governing the physics of the system, and further couple the learned physics to assist the learning of recurring dynamics. A spatio-temporal physics-coupled neural network (ST-PCNN) model is proposed to achieve three goals: (1) learning the underlying physics parameters, (2) transition of local information between spatio-temporal regions, and (3) forecasting future values for the dynamical system. The physics-coupled learning ensures that the proposed model can be tremendously improved by using learned physics parameters, and can achieve good long-range forecasting (e.g., more than 30-steps). Experiments, using simulated and field-collected ocean current data, validate that ST-PCNN outperforms existing physics-informed models.","Huang, Yu; Li, James; Shi, Min; Zhuang, Hanqi; Zhu, Xingquan; Ch'erubin, Laurent; VanZwieten, James; Tang, Yufei",,382,1

In this article, we examine trends in adult mortality (ages 55+) across US states from 1977 to 2017, paying close attention to the shifting geographic pattern of high- and low-mortality states. We find that states in the South tended to fall behind the rest of the country in the 1970s and 1980s, while states in the Great Plains and Mountain West tended to fall behind in the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. In contrast, states on the East and West Coasts have tended to see considerable improvement in mortality. We consider the role of state-level per-capita spending on public welfare programs in the mortality experience of states between 1977 and 2017. We use fixed effects models to show that greater state welfare generosity predicts greater yearly reductions in mortality. State shifts toward more generous welfare spending regimes may contribute to significant geographic divergences in adult mortality in the United States.","Fenelon, Andrew; Witko, Christopher",Health Place,382,25

While it primarily affects the respiratory system, we now have evidence that it affects multiple organ systems in the human body. Cardiac manifestations may include myocarditis, life threatening arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome, systolic heart failure, and cardiogenic shock. Myocarditis is increasingly recognized as a complication of Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) and may result from direct viral injury or from exaggerated host immune response. The diagnosis is established similar to other etiologies, and is based on detailed history, clinical exam, laboratory findings and non-invasive imaging studies. When available, cardiac MRI is the preferred imaging modality. Endomyocardial biopsy may be performed if the diagnosis remains uncertain. Current management is mainly supportive with the potential addition of interventions recommended for severe COVID-19 disease, such as remdesivir, steroids, and convalescent plasma. In the setting of cardiogenic shock and refractory, life-threatening arrhythmias that persist despite medical therapy, advanced mechanical circulatory support devices should be considered. Ultimately, early recognition and aggressive intervention are key factors in reducing morbidity and mortality. Our management strategy is expected to evolve further as we learn more about COVID-19 disease and the associated cardiac complications.","Agdamag, Arianne Clare C; Edmiston, Jonathan B; Charpentier, Victoria; Chowdhury, Mohammed; Fraser, Meg; Maharaj, Valmiki R; Francis, Gary S; Alexy, Tamas",Medicina (Kaunas),382,1

The great majority of COVID-19 patients (>90%) requiring ECMO have been supported using venovenous (V-V) ECMO for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). While COVID-19 ECMO run duration may be longer than in non-COVID-19 ECMO patients, published mortality appears to be similar between the two groups. However, data collection is ongoing, and there is a signal that overall mortality may be increasing. Conventional selection criteria for COVID-19-related ECMO should be used; however, when resources become more constrained during a pandemic, more stringent contraindications should be implemented. Formation of regional ECMO referral networks may facilitate communication, resource sharing, expedited patient referral, and mobile ECMO retrieval. There are no data to suggest deviation from conventional ECMO device or patient management when applying ECMO for COVID-19 patients. Rarely, children may require ECMO support for COVID-19-related ARDS, myocarditis, or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C); conventional selection criteria and management practices should be the standard. We strongly encourage participation in data submission to investigate the optimal use of ECMO for COVID-19.","Badulak, Jenelle; Antonini, M Velia; Stead, Christine M; Shekerdemian, Lara; Raman, Lakshmi; Paden, Matthew L; Agerstrand, Cara; Bartlett, Robert H; Barrett, Nicholas; Combes, Alain; Lorusso, Roberto; Mueller, Thomas; Ogino, Mark T; Peek, Giles; Pellegrino, Vincent; Rabie, Ahmed A; Salazar, Leonardo; Schmidt, Matthieu; Shekar, Kiran; MacLaren, Graeme; Brodie, Daniel",ASAIO J,382,30

In up to 14,134 cases and 1.2 million controls, we found that an s.d. increase in OAS1 levels was associated with reduced COVID-19 death or ventilation (odds ratio (OR) = 0.54, P = 7 × 10-8), hospitalization (OR = 0.61, P = 8 × 10-8) and susceptibility (OR = 0.78, P = 8 × 10-6). Measuring OAS1 levels in 504 individuals, we found that higher plasma OAS1 levels in a non-infectious state were associated with reduced COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. Further analyses suggested that a Neanderthal isoform of OAS1 in individuals of European ancestry affords this protection. Thus, evidence from MR and a case-control study support a protective role for OAS1 in COVID-19 adverse outcomes. Available pharmacological agents that increase OAS1 levels could be prioritized for drug development.","Zhou, Sirui; Butler-Laporte, Guillaume; Nakanishi, Tomoko; Morrison, David R; Afilalo, Jonathan; Afilalo, Marc; Laurent, Laetitia; Pietzner, Maik; Kerrison, Nicola; Zhao, Kaiqiong; Brunet-Ratnasingham, Elsa; Henry, Danielle; Kimchi, Nofar; Afrasiabi, Zaman; Rezk, Nardin; Bouab, Meriem; Petitjean, Louis; Guzman, Charlotte; Xue, Xiaoqing; Tselios, Chris; Vulesevic, Branka; Adeleye, Olumide; Abdullah, Tala; Almamlouk, Noor; Chen, Yiheng; Chassé, Michaël; Durand, Madeleine; Paterson, Clare; Normark, Johan; Frithiof, Robert; Lipcsey, Miklós; Hultström, Michael; Greenwood, Celia M T; Zeberg, Hugo; Langenberg, Claudia; Thysell, Elin; Pollak, Michael; Mooser, Vincent; Forgetta, Vincenzo; Kaufmann, Daniel E; Richards, J Brent",Nat Med,382,1

The organization is delivering care to patients of a genetic disorder, called the sickle cell, in tribal communities. The paper identifies how ICT intermediates knowledge creation practices across the organizational boundaries wherein tribal patients, front-line counselors and expert physicians interact, which then produces context-specific, evidence-based medicine (EBM).Design/methodology/approachThe knowledge-in-practice approach is adopted to conduct an ethnographic study of sickle cell care practices in a non-profit health care organization in Western India. The analysis focuses on ICT-mediated interactional practices among the physicians, front-line counselors, tribal patients and their families, for more than a year-long observation. These are supplemented with informal and formal interviews, archival records and vignettes based on several episodes to explicate the key knowledge creation practices.FindingsTechnology-mediated informative interactions at organizational boundaries can bridge socio-linguistic and interpretive barriers between actors, while also providing a generative structure that leads to the creation of longitudinal clinical evidence about a rare genetic disorder. Three specific ICT-entwined knowledge creation practices emerge, namely, knowing the community, increasing interactional engagement and constructing gradients of socio-clinical history. These practices generate organization-wide knowledge about the social and clinical dimensions of the genetic disorder. The findings are presented through vignettes and a novel conceptual framework.Research limitations/implicationsThis study identifies various useful knowledge creation practices in health care delivery for resource-constrained emerging economy contexts. Further, the study suggests that the involvement of local front-line actors and ICT can become important resources in the delivery of health care in these settings.Originality/valueA novel framework is developed which demonstrates knowledge creation at organizational boundaries wherein the actors use ICT-based practices for effective delivery of health care. The proposed framework may be used by health care organizations in similar contexts providing care to marginalized communities.","Vinayak Ram, Tripathi Popli Manish Ghulyani Swati Desai Shrey Gaur Ajai",Journal of Knowledge Management,382,16

To address this lack of PEE, new solutions have been researched. Among those, full-face snorkeling masks demonstrated to be an interesting option. Among surgical specialties otolaryngologists and thoracic surgeons are at high risk of infection, due to the close contact with airway secretions. OBJECTIVES: We tested the comfort and usability of a modified full-face snorkeling mask (Ocean Reef Mask Aria QR+) as a protective device for otolaryngologic and thoracic surgeries. METHODS: The mask was customized with a 3D-printed adaptor supporting many industrial filter types, including FFP3 and heat and moisture ex- changers (HME). We evaluated surgical performances of the mask, both subjectively, with a questionnaire filled in by the surgeons, as well as objectively, monitoring transcutaneous PCO2 and PO2 values of surgeons during surgical procedures. RESULTS: The modified full-face snorkeling mask was tested during 9 otolaryngologic and 15 thoracic surgery procedures. The device demonstrated very good overall vision quality with some limitations regarding lateral vision and almost no difficulties in usability. Water condensation into the mask was absent in almost every case. Both PO2 and PCO2 param- eters remained within normal ranges during every procedure. DISCUSSION: The modified full-face snorkeling mask can be an innovative PPE. In the current COVID-19 pandemic scenario, the worldwide shortage of protective masks and goggles may exploit this ready-to-use and low-cost solution, especially for high-risk surgical procedures.","Cacco, Tommaso; Fragale, Marco; Sampieri, Claudio; Castello, Eolo; Risso, Carlo; Piras, Maria Teresa; Durando, Paolo; Montecucco, Alfredo; Pariscenti, Gian Luca; Peretti, Giorgio",Med Lav,382,16

Among the changes that the adolescent must face are: accepting their own body, acquiring a social role, establishing new relationships with peers,achieving emotional independence from parents. All of this is not always easy and many times they face a so difficult path that can produce the onset of some mental pathologies. Typical disorders that adolescents can face are the ones related to food. In these pathologies there is an isolation of the soul which corresponds to an alienation from the body: what remains in this loneliness is the gap between the idealized body and the objectified body. In this process of identity determination the idealized body is not able to relate to the real body (Cuzzolaro 2017). The dimension of their own body and the ability to meet the other bodies in the world are compromised; the only possible knowledge is represented by the impoverishment of their own subjectivity and by the attempt to recover it at an abstract level. Adolescents live in a condition of temporal suspension: the future is compromised and the past is demonized; what remains is a present moment made eternal by an indefinitely suspended instant (Juli 2018).

COVID-19 outbreak in Qatar has led to the application of preventive measures and cutting of face-to-face outpatient services across Hamad Medical Corporation, the main provider of primary and tertiary health care, aiming to reduce the risk of transmission. The disruption of face-to-face management of patients with cancer and primary lymphedema added to the lack of literature, specifically on its rehabilitation, during such unprecedented crisis and raised the need to quickly modulate our lymphedema outpatient physiotherapy services to ensure the continuity of care. This article describes how our team redesigned its lymphedema management approach through rapid development of online educational treatment resources and implementation of telerehabilitation to patients with lymphedema for the first time in Qatar. Unforeseen challenges were addressed in a 4-phased plan comprising operational, telephonic, virtual, and face-to-face phases, with a descriptive statistical analysis of data and the outpatient activity recorded throughout the phases. Evaluating the efficacy of such program in future research may open up windows for telerehabilitation to become a cornerstone in lymphedema care even after the pandemic.","Sundrasekaran, A.; Abdalla, E.; Sobani, S.; Shafi, M.; Al-Mudahka, N.

Deep uncertainty surrounds many drivers of projected emissions. Here we use a simple integrated assessment model, calibrated to century-scale data and expert assessments of baseline emissions, global economic growth, and population growth, to make probabilistic projections of carbon emissions through 2100. Under a variety of assumptions about fossil fuel resource levels and decarbonization rates, our projections largely agree with several emissions projections under current policy conditions. Our global sensitivity analysis identifies several key economic drivers of uncertainty in future emissions and shows important higher-level interactions between economic and technological parameters, while population uncertainties are less important. Our analysis also projects relatively low global economic growth rates over the remainder of the century. This illustrates the importance of additional research into economic growth dynamics for climate risk assessment, especially if pledged and future climate mitigation policies are weakened or have delayed implementations. These results showcase the power of using a simple, transparent, and calibrated model.

In 2020, as part of Denmark's extensive, free-of-charge PCR-testing strategy, approximately 4 million individuals (69% of the population) underwent 10·6 million tests. Using these national PCR-test data from 2020, we estimated protection towards repeat infection with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In this population-level observational study, we collected individual-level data on patients who had been tested in Denmark in 2020 from the Danish Microbiology Database and analysed infection rates during the second surge of the COVID-19 epidemic, from Sept 1 to Dec 31, 2020, by comparison of infection rates between individuals with positive and negative PCR tests during the first surge (March to May, 2020). For the main analysis, we excluded people who tested positive for the first time between the two surges and those who died before the second surge. We did an alternative cohort analysis, in which we compared infection rates throughout the year between those with and without a previous confirmed infection at least 3 months earlier, irrespective of date. We also investigated whether differences were found by age group, sex, and time since infection in the alternative cohort analysis. We calculated rate ratios (RRs) adjusted for potential confounders and estimated protection against repeat infection as 1 - RR. FINDINGS: During the first surge (ie, before June, 2020), 533 381 people were tested, of whom 11 727 (2·20%) were PCR positive, and 525 339 were eligible for follow-up in the second surge, of whom 11 068 (2·11%) had tested positive during the first surge. Among eligible PCR-positive individuals from the first surge of the epidemic, 72 (0·65% [95% CI 0·51-0·82]) tested positive again during the second surge compared with 16 819 (3·27% [3·22-3·32]) of 514 271 who tested negative during the first surge (adjusted RR 0·195 [95% CI 0·155-0·246]). Protection against repeat infection was 80·5% (95% CI 75·4-84·5). The alternative cohort analysis gave similar estimates (adjusted RR 0·212 [0·179-0·251], estimated protection 78·8% [74·9-82·1]). In the alternative cohort analysis, among those aged 65 years and older, observed protection against repeat infection was 47·1% (95% CI 24·7-62·8). We found no difference in estimated protection against repeat infection by sex (male 78·4% [72·1-83·2] vs female 79·1% [73·9-83·3]) or evidence of waning protection over time (3-6 months of follow-up 79·3% [74·4-83·3] vs &#8805;7 months of follow-up 77·7% [70·9-82·9]).

METHODS: To that end, a staggered irradiation cycle has been applied which included dose rate values from 0.81 to 4.87 cGy/s, achieving a total absorbed dose of 21.4 Gy. The samples have been irradiated with a linear accelerator and the relations between the induced photocurrent and the average and instantaneous dose rates, and between the accumulated charge and the absorbed dose, have been determined. The radiation-induced output currents were measured by means of an external interface of the devices to a previously designed readout unit. RESULTS: Experimental results of Si PIN photodiode BPW34S have shown a sensitivity of (13.9 ± 0.5) nC/cGy, slight sensitivity dependence on dose rate, and a high linearity of the current with the average and instantaneous dose rate, requiring only 10 V of reverse bias voltage. This device thermal drift has characterized and modelled for temperature effect compensation. CONCLUSIONS: Silicon PIN photodiode BPW34S, previously tested for X-rays and Co-60 gamma ray source, can also be a reliable candidate for dose rate and absorbed skin dose determination in typical radiotherapy treatments irradiations. A low sensitivity loss below 2% up to 21.4 Gy has been measured, allowing its use as an affordable reusable skin dosimeter. Moreover, no significant difference has been observed between its response to dose-per-pulse and changing pulse repetition frequency in terms of sensitivity and dependence with dose-rate value.","Ruiz-García, Isidoro; Román-Raya, Juan; Banqueri, Jesús; Palma, Alberto J; Guirado, Damián; Carvajal, Miguel A",Med. phys,382,24

However, little is known about the clinical characteristics of kidney-related complications, including hematuria, proteinuria, and AKI. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study in China, we analyzed data from electronic medical records of 333 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, including information about clinical, laboratory, radiologic, and other characteristics, as well as information about renal outcomes. RESULTS: We found that 251 of the 333 patients (75.4%) had abnormal urine dipstick tests or AKI. Of 198 patients with renal involvement for the median duration of 12 days, 118 (59.6%) experienced remission of pneumonia during this period, and 111 of 162 (68.5%) patients experienced remission of proteinuria. Among 35 patients who developed AKI (with AKI identified by criteria expanded somewhat beyond the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes definition), 16 (45.7%) experienced complete recovery of kidney function. We suspect that most AKI cases were intrinsic AKI. Patients with renal involvement had higher overall mortality compared with those without renal involvement (28 of 251 [11.2%] versus one of 82 [1.2%], respectively). Stepwise multivariate binary logistic regression analyses showed that severity of pneumonia was the risk factor most commonly associated with lower odds of proteinuric or hematuric remission and recovery from AKI. CONCLUSIONS: Renal abnormalities occurred in the majority of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Although proteinuria, hematuria, and AKI often resolved in such patients within 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms, renal complications in COVID-19 were associated with higher mortality.","Pei, Guangchang; Zhang, Zhiguo; Peng, Jing; Liu, Liu; Zhang, Chunxiu; Yu, Chong; Ma, Zufu; Huang, Yi; Liu, Wei; Yao, Ying; Zeng, Rui; Xu, Gang",J Am Soc Nephrol,382,1

No vaccines are approved for use in humans; therefore, a consistent effort to develop safe and effective MERS vaccines is needed. AREAS COVERED: This review describes the structure of MERS-CoV and the function of its proteins, summarizes MERS vaccine candidates under preclinical study (based on spike and non-spike structural proteins, inactivated virus, and live-attenuated virus), and highlights potential problems that could prevent these vaccines entering clinical trials. It provides guidance for the development of safe and effective MERS-CoV vaccines. EXPERT OPINION: Although many MERS-CoV vaccines have been developed, most remain at the preclinical stage. Some vaccines demonstrate immunogenicity and efficacy in animal models, while others have potential adverse effects or low efficacy against high-dose or divergent virus strains. Novel strategies are needed to design safe and effective MERS vaccines to induce broad-spectrum immune responses and improve protective efficacy against multiple strains of MERS-CoV and MERS-like coronaviruses with pandemic potential. More funds should be invested to move vaccine candidates into human clinical trials.","Zhang, Naru; Shang, Jian; Li, Chaoqun; Zhou, Kehui; Du, Lanying",Expert Rev Vaccines,382,30

To date, there are limited data available on the analytical performance of emerging commercially available assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and integration of these assays into laboratory workflows. Here, we performed a prospective validation study of a commercially available assay, the AusDiagnostics Coronavirus Typing (8-well) assay. Respiratory tract samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing were collected between 1 March and 25 March 2020. All positive samples and a random subset of negative samples were sent to a reference laboratory for confirmation. In total, 2673 samples were analysed using the Coronavirus Typing assay. The predominant sample type was a combined nasopharyngeal/throat swab (2640/2673; 98.8%). Fifty-four patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (2.0%) using the Coronavirus Typing assay; 53/54 (98.1%) positive results and 621/621 (100%) negative results were concordant with the reference laboratory. Compared to the reference laboratory gold standard, sensitivity of the Coronavirus Typing assay for SARS-CoV-2 was 100% (95% CI 93.2-100%), specificity 99.8% (95% CI 99.1-100%), positive predictive value 98.1% (95% CI 90.2-99.7%) and negative predictive value 100% (95% CI 99.4-100%). In many countries, standard regulatory requirements for the introduction of new assays have been replaced by emergency authorisations and it is critical that laboratories share their post-market validation experiences, as the consequences of widespread introduction of a suboptimal assay for SARS-CoV-2 are profound.

Little is known about the psychological aspects, particularly for vulnerable populations including pregnant women.Objectives: To understand the attitude, concerns, and knowledge of the non-infected pregnant women toward the COVID-19 outbreak in order to constitute base data for detailed counseling and to develop targeted messages.Patients and methods: This cross-sectional survey research presented analysis of prospectively collected data yielded at a single tertiary ""Coronavirus Pandemic Hospital"" referral center for a ten days period following the first confirmed death due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey. Non-infected women with a confirmed pregnancy over 30th gestational week were consecutively included. A patient-reported non-validated questionnaire formed by the expert committee that includes 15 specific questions was used. Non-infected, pregnant women over 30th gestational week who applied to the outpatient clinic were consecutively included. A total of 213 women were enrolled, 37 were excluded: 7 for being in the first trimester, 3 were illiterate, and 27 were Syrian refugees having difficulties in translation.Results: A total of 172 pregnant women were included. Overall, four women refused to participate to the survey (1.9%). The mean age was 27.5 ± 5.3 years. Median gestational week and parity were 35 ± 11 weeks and 1 ± 2, respectively. Pregnant women were observed to trust the authorities (65%) and the healthcare staff (92.4%), and their respect was increased (82.5%) during the outbreak. Majority of the women (87.2%) comply with the self-quarantine rules. Half of the women (52%) reported that they felt vulnerable and predominantly were concerned (80%). Approximately one-third of the women constantly keep thinking that they may get infected (35.5%) or they might get infected during/following the delivery or their baby might get infected after being born (42%). Half of the women (50%) were reported that they either had no idea about or think the breastfeeding is not safe during the outbreak. About 45% of the women were confused or had doubts about if the mode of delivery may be affected by the pandemic. Greater part of the participants does not know if COVID-19 might cause birth defects (76%) or preterm birth (64.5%). Counseling flow keys helping pregnant women to overcome misleads, regarding the COVID-19 outbreak is proposed.Conclusions: Non-infected pregnant women with a viable pregnancy at near term were observed to have positive attitude and compliance toward the COVID-19 outbreak and frontline healthcare staff; increased concern and vulnerability; and restricted knowledge about the pregnancy-related outcomes. While the clinical evidence was growing rapidly, this data may guide obstetricians and midwives to perceive what accurate information should be provided to the pregnant women.","Yassa, Murat; Birol, Pinar; Yirmibes, Cihangir; Usta, Canberk; Haydar, Ahmad; Yassa, Ahmet; Sandal, Kemal; Tekin, Arzu Bilge; Tug, Niyazi",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,382,20

The dual epidemics will result in considerable morbidity and mortality; therefore, influenza vaccination may be essential. Recent studies found increased risk of coronavirus in individuals receiving influenza vaccination. AIMS: Our aim is to analyse the association between influenza vaccination and COVID-19 in a population of healthcare workers (HCWs). METHODS: IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 3520 HCWs at a large hospital in Northern Italy. For each participant, we collected data on flu immunization status for the last five flu seasons. Logistic regression was used to test associations between seasonal flu vaccination status and a positive serology tests for COVID-19. RESULTS: During the last five flu seasons, 2492 vaccinations were administered. Serology tests were negative for 3196 (91%) HCWs and residents and only 21 (1%) people had an equivocal test (12.0-15.0 AU/mL). Only 128 (4%) people received a diagnosis of COVID-19, with a positive swab test. No flu vaccinations for the last five flu seasons were specifically associated with diagnosis of COVID-19 or with positive results of serology tests. CONCLUSIONS: Flu vaccinations did not appear to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Influenza vaccination should continue to be recommended for HCWs and for individuals at increased risk for severe illness from respiratory infection.","Belingheri, M; Paladino, M E; Latocca, R; De Vito, G; Riva, M A",Occup. med,382,20

We examined the associations between the proportion of Black residents in NHs and COVID-19 infections and deaths, accounting for structural bias (operationalized as county-level factors) and stratifying by urbanicity/rurality. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional observational cohort study using publicly available data from the LTCfocus, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Long-Term Care Facility COVID-19 Module, and the NYTimes county-level COVID-19 database. Four multivariable linear regression models omitting and including facility characteristics, COVID-19 burden, and county-level fixed effects were estimated. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In total, 11,587 US NHs that reported data on COVID-19 to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and had data in LTCfocus and NYTimes from January 20, 2020 through July 19, 2020. MEASURES: Proportion of Black residents in NHs (exposure); COVID-19 infections and deaths (main outcomes). RESULTS: The proportion of Black residents in NHs were as follows: none= 3639 (31.4%), <20% = 1020 (8.8%), 20%-49.9% = 1586 (13.7%), &#8805;50 = 681 (5.9%), not reported = 4661 (40.2%). NHs with any Black residents showed significantly more COVID-19 infections and deaths than NHs with no Black residents. There were 13.6 percentage points more infections and 3.5 percentage points more deaths in NHs with &#8805;50% Black residents than in NHs with no Black residents (P < .001). Although facility characteristics explained some of the differences found in multivariable analyses, county-level factors and rurality explained more of the differences. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: It is likely that attributes of place, such as resources, services, and providers, important to equitable care and health outcomes are not readily available to counties where NHs have greater proportions of Black residents. Structural bias may underlie these inequities. It is imperative that support be provided to NHs that serve greater proportions of Black residents while considering the rurality of the NH setting.","Travers, Jasmine L; Agarwal, Mansi; Estrada, Leah V; Dick, Andrew W; Gracner, Tadeja; Wu, Bei; Stone, Patricia W",J.

In a publicly-funded HIV clinic, we aimed to evaluate a pre-visit phone-based planning intervention to address anticipated barriers to telemedicine. METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic randomized controlled trial of patients scheduled for a phone-based HIV primary care visit at the Ward 86 HIV clinic in San Francisco from 15 April to 15 May 2020. Once reached by phone, patients were randomized to either have a structured pre-visit planning intervention to address barriers to an upcoming telemedicine visit versus a standard reminder call. The primary outcome was telemedicine visit attendance. RESULTS: Of 476 scheduled telemedicine visits, 280 patients were reached by a pre-visit call to offer enrollment. Patients were less likely to be reached if virally unsuppressed (odds ratio (OR) 0.11, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.03-0.48), CD4 < 200 (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07-0.85), or were homeless (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07-0.87). There was no difference between intervention and control in scheduled visit attendance (83% v. 78%, OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.67-2.81). CONCLUSIONS: A structured phone-based planning call to address barriers to telemedicine in a public HIV clinic was less likely to reach patients with poorly-controlled HIV and patients experiencing homelessness, suggesting additional interventions may be needed in this population to ensure access to telemedicine-based care. Among patients reachable by phone, telemedicine visit attendance was high and not improved with a structured pre-visit intervention, suggesting that standard reminders may be adequate in this population.","Hickey, Matthew D; Sergi, Francesco; Zhang, Kevin; Spinelli, Matthew A; Black, Douglas; Sola, Cyril; Blaz, Vanessa; Nguyen, Janet Q; Oskarsson, Jon; Gandhi, Monica; Havlir, Diane V",J Telemed Telecare,382,8

Therefore, it is difficult to point out what the patients exactly need because their needs are set on a broad range of a difficult boundary. The level of care that follows will be complex and multifactorial because nursing will challenge the interaction with the individual as a whole: behaviors and relations with family members. At this stage exploring interpersonal conflicts, with past and present aggression behaviors will be crucial. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Aim of this paper is to investigate the professional experience in a work context where the patient's clinical condition poses a daily challenge from a physical and emotional perspective. Narrative investigation is performed here in order to explore the psychological load of the professional's psychological experience and its implication in facing aggressive situations. Moreover, this investigation highlights the importance of some professional and personal resources that can be made available to the operator. RESULTS: These tools could improve the understanding of the subjective experience of acute events guiding the individual through an exploration of the phenomenology of what happened decreasing the intimate stress load. CONCLUSIONS: A constant updating, the knowledge of de-escalation techniques and sharing the experience in dedicated settings could be important allies in the management of risk events.","Moriconi, Simona; Balducci, Pierfrancesco Maria; Tortorella, Alfonso",Psychiatr Danub,382,14

We aimed to investigate the role of peripheral blood eosinophil (EOS) as a marker in the course of the virus infection to improve the efficiency of diagnosis and evaluation of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: 227 pneumonia patients who visited the fever clinics in Shanghai General Hospital and 97 hospitalized COVID-19 patients admitted to Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center were involved in a retrospective research study. Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were collected. The trend of EOS level in COVID-19 patients and comparison among patients with different severity were summarized. RESULTS: The majority of COVID-19 patients (71.7%) had a decrease in circulating EOS counts, which was significantly more frequent than other types of pneumonia patients. EOS counts had good value for COVID-19 prediction, even higher when combined with neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. Patients with low EOS counts at admission were more likely to have fever, fatigue, and shortness of breath, with more lesions in chest CT and radiographic aggravation, and longer length of hospital stay and course of disease than those with normal EOS counts. Circulating EOS level gradually increased over the time, and was synchronous with the improvement in chest CT (12 days vs 13 days, P = .07), later than that of body temperature (12 days vs 10 days, P = .014), but earlier than that of the negative conversion of nucleic acid assays (12 days vs 17 days, P = .001). CONCLUSION: Peripheral blood EOS counts may be an effective and efficient indicator in diagnosis, Evaluation, and prognosis monitoring of COVID-19 patients.","Xie, Guogang; Ding, Fengming; Han, Lei; Yin, Dongning; Lu, Hongzhou; Zhang, Min",Allergy,382,24

One study concerned repetitions at one temperature, the other concerned isothermal experiments at various temperatures. Multilevel models characterize variation at various levels and handle dependencies in the data. The Weibull model was applied using Bayesian regression. The research question was how parameters varied with experimental conditions and how data can best be analyzed: no pooling (each experiment analyzed separately), complete pooling (all data analyzed together) or partial pooling (connecting the experiments while allowing for variation between experiments). In the first case study, level 1 consisted of the measurements, level 2 of the group of repetitions. While variation in the initial number parameter was low (set by the researchers), the Weibull shape factor varied for each repetition from 0.58-1.44, and the rate parameter from 0.006-0.074 h. With partial pooling variation was much less, with complete pooling variation was strongly underestimated. In the second case study, level 1 consisted of the measurements, level 2 of the group of repetitions per temperature experiment, level 3 of the cluster of various temperature experiments. The research question was how temperature affected the Weibull parameters. Variation in initial numbers was low (set by the researchers), the rate parameter was obviously affected by temperature, the estimate of the shape parameter depended on how the data were analyzed. With partial pooling, and one-step global modeling with a Bigelow-type model for the rate parameter, shape parameter variation was minimal. Model comparison based on prediction capacity of the various models was explored. The probability distribution of calculated decimal reduction times was much narrower using multilevel global modeling compared to the usual single level two-step approach. Multilevel modeling of microbial heat inactivation appears to be a suitable and powerful method to characterize and quantify variation at various levels. It handles possible dependencies in the data, and yields unbiased parameter estimates. The answer on the question ""to pool or not to pool"" depends on the goal of modeling, but if the goal is prediction, then partial pooling using multilevel modeling is the answer, provided that the experimental data allow that.","van Boekel, M A J S",Int J Food Microbiol,382,32

In Spain, the state of alarm was established from March 15 to June 20, 2020. Usually this fact decreased people's mobility and physical activity, in addition to producing or exacerbating psychological disorders. Our aim was to determine the influence that this condition had over the short-term ponderal results of patients undergoing laparoscopic vertical gastrectomy from May 2019 to May 2020. METHODS: Case-control study for comparing the percentage of excess weight lost (%EWL) and the percentage of total weight lost (%TWL) of patients that underwent a VG during the last year, so they were affected by lockdown in April and part of March 2020 (group 1), to the %EWL and %TWL of a control group (group 2), obtained from our previous series.

The investigations showed that in May 20, 2020, more than 6150 people have been affected by methanol poisoning from whom 804 deaths have been reported. A major cause of the increased rate of alcohol poisoning in this period was actually the illusion that alcohol could eliminate the coronaviruses having entered the body.

METHODS: Established patients at New York University Langone Health with IMID (n=51) receiving the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination were assessed at baseline and after second immunisation. Healthy subjects served as controls (n=26). IgG antibody responses to the spike protein were analysed for humoral response. Cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 was further analysed using high-parameter spectral flow cytometry. A second independent, validation cohort of controls (n=182) and patients with IMID (n=31) from Erlangen, Germany, were also analysed for humoral immune response. RESULTS: Although healthy subjects (n=208) and patients with IMID on biologic treatments (mostly on tumour necrosis factor blockers, n=37) demonstrate robust antibody responses (over 90%), those patients with IMID on background methotrexate (n=45) achieve an adequate response in only 62.2% of cases. Similarly, patients with IMID on methotrexate do not demonstrate an increase in CD8+ T-cell activation after vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: In two independent cohorts of patients with IMID, methotrexate, a widely used immunomodulator for the treatment of several IMIDs, adversely affected humoral and cellular immune response to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Although precise cut-offs for immunogenicity that correlate with vaccine efficacy are yet to be established, our findings suggest that different strategies may need to be explored in patients with IMID taking methotrexate to increase the chances of immunisation efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 as has been demonstrated for augmenting immunogenicity to other viral vaccines.","Haberman, Rebecca H; Herati, Ramin; Simon, David; Samanovic, Marie; Blank, Rebecca B; Tuen, Michael; Koralov, Sergei B; Atreya, Raja; Tascilar, Koray; Allen, Joseph R; Castillo, Rochelle; Cornelius, Amber R; Rackoff, Paula; Solomon, Gary; Adhikari, Samrachana; Azar, Natalie; Rosenthal, Pamela; Izmirly, Peter; Samuels, Jonathan; Golden, Brian; Reddy, Soumya M; Neurath, Markus F; Abramson, Steven B; Schett, Georg; Mulligan, Mark J; Scher, Jose U",Ann. rheum. dis,382,16

To compare the rate of clinical improvement between those who started LPV/ritonavir (LPV/r)+HCQ within 5 days of symptom onset (early treatment, ET) and those who started later (delayed treatment, DT). This was a retrospective intent-to-treat analysis of the hospitalized patients who started LPV/r + HCQ between 21 February and 20 March 2020. The association between the timing of treatment and the probability of 30-day mortality was assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic models. The study involved 172 patients: 43 (25%) in the ET and 129 (75%) in the DT group. The rate of clinical improvement increased over time to 73.3% on day 30, without any significant difference between the two groups (Gray's test P = .213). After adjusting for potentially relevant clinical variables, there was no significant association between the timing of the start of treatment and the probability of 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] ET vs DT = 1.45, 95% confidence interval 0.50-4.19).

How ethnicity affects Indigenous peoples in Mexico is unclear. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to determine the mortality associated with ethnicity, particularly of Indigenous peoples, in a large sample of patients with COVID-19 in Mexico. METHODS: We used open access data from the Mexican Ministry of Health, which includes data of all confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country. We used descriptive statistics to compare differences among different groups of patients. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios while adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: From February 28 to August 3, 2020, a total of 416546 adult patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. Among these, 4178 were Indigenous peoples. Among all patients with COVID-19, whether hospitalized or not, a higher proportion of Indigenous peoples died compared to non-Indigenous people (16.5% vs 11.1%, respectively). Among hospitalized patients, a higher proportion of Indigenous peoples died (37.1%) compared to non-Indigenous peoples (36.3%). Deaths outside the hospital were also higher among Indigenous peoples (3.7% vs 1.7%). A higher proportion of Indigenous peoples died in both the private and public health care sectors. The adjusted odds ratio for COVID-19 mortality among Indigenous peoples with COVID-19 was 1.13 (95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.24). The adjusted odds ratio for COVID-19 mortality among Indigenous peoples with COVID-19 was higher among those who received only ambulatory care (1.55, 95% confidence interval 1.24 to 1.92). DISCUSSION: In this large sample of patients with COVID-19, the findings suggest that Indigenous peoples in Mexico have a higher risk of death from COVID-19, especially outside the hospital. These findings suggest Indigenous peoples lack access to care more so than non-Indigenous people during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico.","Ibarra-Nava, Ismael; Flores-Rodriguez, Kathia G; Ruiz-Herrera, Violeta; Ochoa-Bayona, Hilda C; Salinas-Zertuche, Alfonso; Padilla-Orozco, Magaly; Salazar-Montalvo, Raul G",PLoS One,382,10

It also highlights, like no other crisis before, existing weaknesses in health information systems (HIS). This article summarizes these key challenges for HIS in times of a pandemic and beyond, with a focus on European countries. It builds on the experiences of a large consortium representing HIS experts in key positions in national public health or similar institutes across Europe. METHODS: Data were collected in bi-weekly conference calls organized by the InfAct project between February and June 2020. Emerging themes were clustered and analysed around a WHO framework for health information systems (HIS). We analyse strengths of HIS at two levels: (i) dealing with health information directly, and (ii) dealing with other parts of information systems that allow for a holistic assessment of the pandemic (including health-related aspects). RESULTS: The analysis highlights the need for capacity-building in HIS before a pandemic hits, the relevance of going beyond health information only related to health care but taking a broader perspective (e.g. on vulnerable groups), the need for strong reporting systems on staffing numbers and in primary care. Further, data linkage emerges as a crucial precondition to identify unmet needs for essential health care services in a timely manner. Finally, room for innovation and digitalisation is key to be able to react flexibly in times of crisis. Trust for health information stakeholders is another important factor to create strong HIS. CONCLUSIONS: The strengths and shortcomings of European HIS that have been observed during the COVID-19 crisis highlight the need for strong HIS beyond the crisis. The experiences reported leave as a central message that successful reactions to the pandemic are (also) grounded in strong HIS that ultimately not only benefit the health of the population but also create a number of economic and psycho-social benefits. Strong data reporting schemes may also support fine-tuning of containment measures during a pandemic as well as transition phases.","Schmidt, Andrea E; Abboud, Linda A; Bogaert, Petronille",Arch Public Health,382,30

STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study. 49 patients presenting a vocal cord motility impairment between 2012 and 2018 were included. METHODS: Classical acoustic parameters, including jitter, shimmer and NHR, as well as the CPPS were obtained for each patient with a vocal cord motility impairment confirmed by means of a fiberoptic laryngoscopy. We calculated the S/E ratio of each patient to establish the glottal efficiency. An independent sample t test and a Pearson correlation test were used to compare data. RESULTS: Patients presenting a vocal cord motility impairment present abnormal values of the CPPS. Those patients presenting a vocal cord paralysis present lower values of those presenting a vocal cord paresis, with statistically significant difference (P < 0.005). CPPS and the S/E ratio present a moderate negative correlation (- 0.29). CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with a vocal cord motility impairment present abnormal values for CPPS and those values are lower, the greater the motility impairment is. Therefore, CPPS presents as an objective, measurable and reproducible acoustic parameter of dysphonia that will improve the evaluation of patients presenting vocal pathologies.","Delgado-Vargas, Beatriz; Acle-Cervera, Leticia; Sánz-López, Lorena; Bonet-Loscertales, Mireya; Pérez-Naranjo, Narcisa; Fuentes-Navajo, Patricia",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,382,23

We aimed to map early impacts of the pandemic on people with pre-existing mental health conditions and services they use, and to identify individual and service-level strategies adopted to manage these. METHODS: We searched for relevant material in the public domain published before 30 April 2020, including papers in scientific and professional journals, published first person accounts, media articles, and publications by governments, charities and professional associations. Search languages were English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Mandarin Chinese. Relevant content was retrieved and summarised via a rapid qualitative framework synthesis approach. RESULTS: We found 872 eligible sources from 28 countries. Most documented observations and experiences rather than reporting research data. We found many reports of deteriorations in symptoms, and of impacts of loneliness and social isolation and of lack of access to services and resources, but sometimes also of resilience, effective self-management and peer support. Immediate service challenges related to controlling infection, especially in inpatient and residential settings, and establishing remote working, especially in the community. We summarise reports of swiftly implemented adaptations and innovations, but also of pressing ethical challenges and concerns for the future.

To address the research gap, this study examined whether two types of rumination and perceived social support predict psychological distress during the pandemic. METHODS: Participants were recruited from communities of the greater Daegu area (n=316) where the first massive outbreak in South Korea occurred and most residents underwent substantial disruption of daily life. They completed self-report questionnaires that included measures of psychological distress, event-related rumination, and social support. RESULTS: The hierarchical regression analysis showed that maladaptive intrusive rumination and perceived social support predicted increases and decreases in psychological distress, respectively, even when subjective severity of COVID-19-related experiences was controlled. Putatively adaptive type of rumination (i.e., deliberate rumination) was not a significant predictor concurrently. CONCLUSION: This is among the early endeavors to comprehensively understand risk and protective factors associated with an effective coping strategy against the COVID-19 crisis. Our results indicate that intrusive rumination aggravates but social support mitigates psychological distress during the pandemic, indicating that we can better adapt by differently attending to recent experiences and maintaining perceived social support.","Kang, Hyo Shin; Kim, Bin-Na",,382,1

AIM: To characterize the serum metabolome of hepatocellular carcinoma in order to develop a new metabolomics diagnostic model and identifying novel biomarkers for screening hepatocellular carcinoma based on the pattern recognition method. METHODS: Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy was used to characterize the serum metabolome of hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 30) and cirrhosis (n = 29) patients, followed by sequential feature selection combined with linear discriminant analysis to process the multivariate data. RESULTS: The concentrations of most metabolites, including proline, were lower in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, whereas the hydroxypurine levels were higher in these patients. As ordinary analysis models failed to discriminate hepatocellular carcinoma from cirrhosis, pattern recognition analysis was used to establish a pattern recognition model that included hydroxypurine and proline. The leave-one-out cross-validation accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were 95.00% and 0.90 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.81-0.99] for the training set, respectively, and 78.95% and 0.84 (95%CI: 0.67-1.00) for the validation set, respectively. In contrast, for &#945;-fetoprotein, the accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 65.00% and 0.69 (95%CI: 0.52-0.86) for the training set, respectively, and 68.42% and 0.68 (95%CI: 0.41-0.94) for the validation set, respectively. The Z test revealed that the area under the curve of the linear discriminant analysis model was significantly higher than the area under the curve of &#945;-fetoprotein (P < 0.05) in both the training and validation sets. CONCLUSION: Hydroxypurine and proline might be novel biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma, and this disease could be diagnosed by the metabolomics model based on pattern recognition.","Zhou, Peng-Cheng; Sun, Lun-Quan; Shao, Li; Yi, Lun-Zhao; Li, Ning; Fan, Xue-Gong",World J Gastroenterol,382,16

Genetic counseling (GC) is important for accurate risk assessment, diagnosis, and management of inherited cancers. Numerous barriers prevent AYA access to genetic services. This study describes outcomes of a genetic evaluation initiative (GEI) regarding utilization of genetic services among AYAs. Methods: To improve AYA access to GC, the AYA program at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center implemented GEI, a process for identifying and referring eligible patients for GC. We collected retrospective electronic medical record data between July 12, 2018 and July 12, 2019 to capture AYA's clinical characteristics, genetic referral, scheduled appointments, counseling, testing, and results. Results: In total, 516 AYAs were referred to the AYA clinic during the study period with a median age of first cancer diagnosis of 17 years. One hundred sixty-six AYAs were identified who would benefit from genetic evaluation, 57 (34.3%) of whom had previously undergone counseling. One hundred nine patients were recommended for referral to GC, and 64.2% (70/109) were referred by the AYA team. To date, 58.6% (41/70) met with a genetic counselor and 75.6% (31/41) completed genetic testing, which yielded 1 pathogenic, 2 uncertain, and 29 benign results. Conclusion: The GEI resulted in a 72.0% relative increase in the rate of GC utilization and represents a novel approach to increasing AYA patient access to cancer genetic services in this population.","Makhnoon, Sukh; Corredor, Jessica; Arun, Banu; Bell, Donna; Yarbrough, Angela; Livingston, John Andrew; Peterson, Susan K; Roth, Michael",Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology (Online),382,20

We aimed to provide COVID-19-specific protocol optimization recommendations limiting US technologist exposure while optimizing patient selection. METHODS: A novel two-pronged algorithm was implemented to limit the DVT US studies on patients with COVID-19 prospectively, which included direct physician communication with the care team and a COVID-19-specific imaging protocol was instated to reduce US technologist exposure. To assess the pretest risk of DVT, the sensitivity and specificity of serum d-dimer in 500-unit increments from 500 to 8000 ng/mL and a receiver operating characteristic curve to assess performance of serum d-dimer in predicting DVT was generated. Rates of DVT, pulmonary embolism, and scan times were compared using t-test and Fisher's exact test (before and after implementation of the protocol). RESULTS: Direct physician communication resulted in cancellation or deferral of 72% of requested examinations in COVID-19-positive patients. A serum d-dimer of >4000 ng/mL yielded a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 70% (95% confidence interval, 0.54-0.86) for venous thromboembolism. Using the COVID-19-specific protocol, there was a significant (50%) decrease in the scan time (P < .0001) in comparison with the conventional protocol. CONCLUSIONS: A direct physician communication policy between imaging physician and referring physician resulted in deferral or cancellation of a majority of requested DVT US examinations. An abbreviated COVID-19-specific imaging protocol significantly decreased exposure time to the US technologist.","Dua, Anahita; Thondapu, Vikas; Rosovsky, Rachel; Hunt, David; Latz, Christopher; Waller, H David; Manchester, Scott; Patell, Rushad; Romero, Javier; Ghoshhajra, Brian; Eagleton, Matthew; Brink, James; Hedgire, Sandeep",J.

The aim of this study is to examine: (i) how two different dimensions of trust (general/institutional) are associated with alcohol use among adolescents; (ii) how these dimensions interact with alcohol use; and (iii) whether the associations are moderated by sex, parenting, health, school satisfaction or economic disadvantage. METHODS: A nationwide sample of 5549 adolescents (aged 15-16 years) in Sweden answered a questionnaire in school. General and institutional trust were measured with five items each. Logistic regressions were used to examine associations between drinking and the trust dimensions, and the cross-combinations of these. Moderation by sex, parenting, health, school satisfaction and economic disadvantage was tested. RESULTS: General and institutional trust were both significantly associated with drinking. High scores on both dimensions simultaneously were associated with the lowest probability of drinking, and low scores on both with the highest. Low institutional trust had a stronger association than low general trust. The combination of high institutional/low general trust was more protective than low institutional/high general trust. The association between general trust and drinking was moderated by school satisfaction, and the relationship between institutional trust and drinking was moderated by parental support and control. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: High trust is associated with a lower probability of past-year drinking among 15-16-year-olds.

Targeting the main protease (Mpro, 3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is an appealing approach for drug development because this enzyme plays a significant role in the viral replication and transcription. The available crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro determined in the presence of different ligands and inhibitor-like compounds provide a platform for the quick development of selective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. In this study, we utilized the structural information of co-crystallized SARS-CoV-2 Mpro for the structure-guided drug discovery of high-affinity inhibitors from the PubChem database. The screened compounds were selected on the basis of their physicochemical properties, drug-likeliness, and strength of affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Finally, we have identified 6-Deaminosinefungin (PubChem ID: 10428963) and UNII-O9H5KY11SV (PubChem ID: 71481120) as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro which may be further exploited in drug development to address SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Both compounds are structural analogs of known antivirals, having considerable protease inhibitory potential with improved pharmacological properties. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations suggested SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in complex with these compounds is stable during the simulation period with minimal structural changes.

Objective: To assess autonomic function and relate the findings to the severity and outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Methods: We included consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to the 21st COVID-19 Department of the east campus of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from February 6 to March 7, 2020. Clinical data were collected. Heart rate variability (HRV), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), D-dimer, and lymphocytes and subsets counts were analysed at two time points: nucleic-acid test positive and negative. Psychological symptoms were assessed after discharge. Results: All patients were divided into a mild group (13) and a severe group (21). The latter was further divided into two categories according to the trend of HRV. Severe patients had a significantly lower standard deviation of the RR intervals (SDNN) (P &lt; 0.001), standard deviation of the averages of NN intervals (SDANN) (P &lt; 0.001), and a higher ratio of low- to high-frequency power (LF/HF) (P = 0.016).

The COVID-19 pandemic displaced many youth from their normative sport activities. As a result, sport-based positive-youth development (PYD) programs, typically delivered in person, had to reimagine ways to reach and engage youth in sport and life skill development. In fall 2020, The Los Angeles Football Club Youth Leadership Program (LAFC YLP) developed seven virtual sport-based PYD videos and one workshop for 120 socially vulnerable youth and their families. All virtual activities were designed to teach life skills through sport and play. Our study sought to explore the accessibility of the virtual sport-based PYD activities, the lived experiences of youth participants during lockdown, and learning outcomes of youth and families who participated in the program. We developed a mixed methods study using an online survey and virtual platform to allow youth to share photos, draw pictures, and leave comments about their lived experiences. Our findings indicated 53 youth and their families participated in the virtual sport-based PYD program and reported the activities were accessible, enjoyable, and challenging for the youth participants. In addition, 26 youth shared photos, images, or posts about their lived experiences. Our thematic analysis of the photos, images, and posts indicated the virtual sport-based PYD activities facilitated positive emotional responses, positive peer interaction, engagement with family, and utilization of environmental resources during the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, our findings also suggest virtual sport-based PYD activities may facilitate life skill transfer; an important developmental mechanism for learning in lieu of the decreased opportunities for sport and social interaction during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bates, Samantha; Greene, Dekia; O039,; Quinn, Luke",Child Adolesc Social Work J,382,16

At this stage, fast, accurate and early clinical assessment of the disease severity is vital. To support decision making and logistical planning in healthcare systems, this study leverages a database of blood samples from 485 infected patients in the region of Wuhan, China, to identify crucial predictive biomarkers of disease mortality. For this purpose, machine learning tools selected three biomarkers that predict the mortality of individual patients more than 10 days in advance with more than 90% accuracy: lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). In particular, relatively high levels of LDH alone seem to play a crucial role in distinguishing the vast majority of cases that require immediate medical attention. This finding is consistent with current medical knowledge that high LDH levels are associated with tissue breakdown occurring in various diseases, including pulmonary disorders such as pneumonia. Overall, this Article suggests a simple and operable decision rule to quickly predict patients at the highest risk, allowing them to be prioritized and potentially reducing the mortality rate.","Yan, Li; Zhang, Hai-Tao; Goncalves, Jorge; Xiao, Yang; Wang, Maolin; Guo, Yuqi; Sun, Chuan; Tang, Xiuchuan; Jing, Liang; Zhang, Mingyang; Huang, Xiang; Xiao, Ying; Cao, Haosen; Chen, Yanyan; Ren, Tongxin; Wang, Fang; Xiao, Yaru; Huang, Sufang; Tan, Xi; Huang, Niannian; Jiao, Bo; Cheng, Cheng; Zhang, Yong; Luo, Ailin; Mombaerts, Laurent; Jin, Junyang; Cao, Zhiguo; Li, Shusheng; Xu, Hui; Yuan, Ye",Nat.

Pregnancy is considered as a critical period of exposure to BPA because of the foetal sensitivity to endocrine disruption. Because of its wide use in food packaging, BPA is found in common foods and in infant formulae. We used a lifetime approach to simulate dietary exposure trajectories of a French population and to assess the associated health risk. Moreover, a semi-physiological based toxicokinetic model was used to simulate the maternal-foetal exchanges of BPA during pregnancy. Metabolism was taken into account by considering the glucuronidation of BPA by the foetal-placental unit, as well as the reactivation of BPA-glucuronide into BPA in the foetal compartment. From maternal critical daily exposures defined by ANSES based on effects for different endpoints of BPA in the unborn child (i.e. 0.083, 0.17, 0.29 and 0.33 µg/kg bw/d, respectively based on effects on mammary gland, brain and behaviour, metabolism and obesity and female reproductive system), resulting concentrations of BPA in the foetal compartment were estimated and health risk was assessed for the sub-population of unborn children. This work leads to the conclusion that while a health risk due to dietary exposures of the general population can be excluded, this is not the case for the sub-population of pregnant women, in view of the levels of foetal exposure to BPA.","Pruvost-Couvreur, Manon; Picard-Hagen, Nicole; Le Bizec, Bruno; Rivière, Gilles",Int J Hyg Environ Health,382,10

Data are scarce on RDV utilization in real-world settings or how use has changed over the course of the pandemic. Using chargemaster inpatient data from the Premier Healthcare Database, we describe the patient population and use of RDV following Emergency Use Authorization. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, adult patients admitted May 1st - Nov 30th 2020 with a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis of COVID-19 (ICD-10-CM: U07.1) were identified and their first COVID-related hospital admission was considered. Descriptive statistics were reported for demographic characteristics of RDV and non-RDV treated patients. RDV utilization over time and by region was examined. Results: Of the 190,529 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in 823 hospitals, 55,030 (29%) were treated with RDV in 589 hospitals. RDV utilization over time increased from 5% of patients in May to 47% in Nov 2020. In Nov, RDV utilization was 57% in the West, followed by 49% in the South, 48% in the Midwest and 27% in the Northeast. Over time, RDV was initiated earlier in the course of hospitalization. Initiation within the first 2 days of hospitalization increased from 40% to 85% from May to Nov 2020. The average age was 63.6 years (SD=15.3) and 63.5 years (SD=17.3) for RDV-treated and non-RDV treated patients, respectively. More than half of the patients were male (RDV: 56%;Non-RDV: 52%) and about a quarter had commercial insurance (RDV: 28%;Non-RDV: 22%). Racial distribution (white, black, and other) was similar between RDV and non-RDV patients. Conclusions: Overall use of RDV and initiation within the first two days of hospitalization have substantially increased over the course of the pandemic in the United States.","Mozaffari, E.; Chandak, A.; Liang, S.; Gayle, J.; Haubrich, R.; Thrun, M.; Hodgkins, P.",Value in Health,382,16

It included the creation of five virtual clinics for health workers, being the Burnout, Post-traumatic Stress and Compassion Fatigue clinic one of them. Objective To describe the basal sociodemographic and psychological characteristics of health workers attending online mindfulness sessions as part of the treatment of the aforementioned clinic. Method This is a cross-sectional report part of a major nationwide and longitudinal project. All attendants responded to digital sociodemographics and COVID-19 questionnaires, the Extended Physician Well-Being Index (EPWBI), and the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) TOP-8 index. Results Of the 507 health workers that participated, 70.02% of them were at risk of burnout according to the Extended Well-Being Index and 57.31, 7.91 and 2.77% had a mild, moderate, and severe risk of PTSD, respectively. The most affected were the female health workers, from metropolitan or central areas of the country, and those diagnosed with COVID-19 or exposed to a person with the diagnosis. Discussion and conclusion Mexican health workers attending mindfulness sessions presented high frequencies of PTSD symptoms and burnout.

Utilizing quantile-on-quantile (QQ) estimation technique, we examine in what manner the quantiles of COVID-19 affect the quantiles of air pollution and vice versa. The primary findings confirm overall dependence between COVID-19 and air pollution. Empirical results exhibit a strong negative effect of COVID-19 on air pollution in New York, Texas, Illinois, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania; especially at medium to higher quantiles, while New Jersey, Illinois, Arizona, and Georgia show strong negative effect mainly at lower quantiles. Contrarily, COVID-19 positively affects air pollution in Pennsylvania at extreme lower quantiles. On the other side, air pollution predominantly caused to increase in the intensity of COVID-19 cases across all states except lower quantiles of Massachusetts, and extreme higher quantiles of Arizona and New Jersey, where this effect becomes less pronounced or negative. Concludingly, a rare positive fallout of COVID-19 is reducing environmental pressure, while higher environmental pollution causes to increase the vulnerability of COVID-19 cases. These findings imply that air pollution is at the heart of chronic diseases, therefore the state government should consider these asymmetric channels and introduce appropriate policy measures to reset and control atmospheric emissions.","Razzaq, Asif; Sharif, Arshian; Aziz, Noshaba; Irfan, Muhammad; Jermsittiparsert, Kittisak",Environ Res,382,9

This paper reviews the available evidence for out-patient management of three of the most common causes for emergency referral to the otolaryngology team: tonsillitis, peri-tonsillar abscess and epistaxis. METHODS: A literature review was performed, searching all available online databases and resources. The Medical Subject Headings 'tonsillitis', 'pharyngotonsillitis', 'quinsy', 'peritonsillar abscess' and 'epistaxis' were used. Papers discussing out-patient management were reviewed by the authors. RESULTS: Out-patient and ambulatory pathways for tonsillitis and peritonsillar abscess are well described for patients meeting appropriate criteria. Safe discharge of select patients is safe and should be encouraged in the current clinical climate. Safe discharge of patients with epistaxis who have bleeding controlled is also well described. CONCLUSION: In select cases, tonsillitis, quinsy and epistaxis patients can be safely managed out of hospital, with low re-admission rates.","Heining, C J; Amlani, A; Doshi, J",J Laryngol Otol,382,26

So far, most studies have focused on a single type of virus detection method, either PCR, virus isolation or virome sequencing. Here we present a comprehensive approach in virus discovery, using all three discovery methods on samples from the same bats. By family-specific PCR screening we found sequences of paramyxoviruses, adenoviruses, herpesviruses and one coronavirus. By cell culture we isolated a novel bat adenovirus and bat orthoreovirus. Virome sequencing revealed viral sequences of ten different virus families and orders: three bat nairoviruses, three phenuiviruses, one orbivirus, one rotavirus, one orthoreovirus, one mononegavirus, five parvoviruses, seven picornaviruses, three retroviruses, one totivirus and two thymoviruses were discovered. Of all viruses identified by family-specific PCR in the original samples, none was found by metagenomic sequencing. Vice versa, none of the viruses found by the metagenomic virome approach was detected by family-specific PCRs targeting the same family. The discrepancy of detected viruses by different detection approaches suggests that a combined approach using different detection methods is necessary for virus discovery studies.","Kohl, Claudia; Brinkmann, Annika; Radonic, Aleksandar; Dabrowski, Piotr Wojtek; Mühldorfer, Kristin; Nitsche, Andreas; Wibbelt, Gudrun; Kurth, Andreas",Sci Rep,382,20

To compensate for the lack of social encounters, people have been advised to connect with others via digital communication channels. Drawing on a psychological framework combined with assumptions from communication science, we therefore investigated whether technology-mediated communication can actually meet individuals' social needs to foster compliance with distancing measures and whether there are differences between distinct communication channels. Based on an online survey (N = 301) during the first national lockdown in Germany, we found that the impact of audio-visual communication is limited. Instead, the data showed that text-based communication indirectly fostered willingness to adhere to physical distancing through the pathway of increased feelings of social support and life satisfaction. Three follow-up surveys (N = 180) revealed that while feelings of social support increased, people's technology-based communication and willingness to adhere to distancing measures decreased. Our results challenge the assumption that audio-visual communication compensates for lack of physical contact more effectively than text-based communication. This study highlights the potential of text-based communication to increase feelings of social support, which may be particularly important during a pandemic.","Kluck, Jan P; Stoyanova, Filipa; Krämer, Nicole C",,382,24

Airborne transmission is caused by aerosols that remain infectious when suspended in air over long distances and time. In the clinical setting, airborne transmission may occur during aerosol generating procedures like flexible bronchoscopy. To date, although the role of children in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is not clear the execution of bronchoscopy is associated with a considerably increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to HCWs. The aim of this overview is to summarize available recommendations and to apply them to pediatric bronchoscopy. We performed systematic literature searches using the MEDLINE (accessed via PubMed) and Scopus databases. We reviewed major recommendations and position statements published at the moment by the American Association for Bronchology and Interventional Pulmonology, WHO, European Center for Disease Prevention and Control and expert groups on the management of patients with COVID-19 to limit transmission among HCWs. To date there is a lack of recommendations for safe bronchoscopy during the pandemic period. The main indications concern adults and little has been said about children.

We propose to broaden the research on superspreaders through integrating human mobility data and geographical factors to identify superspreading environment. Six types of popular public facilities were selected: bars, shopping centres, karaoke/cinemas, mega shopping malls, public libraries, and sports centres. A historical dataset on mobility was used to calculate the generalized activity space and space-time prism of individuals during a pre-pandemic period. Analysis of geographic interconnections of public facilities yielded locations by different classes of potential spatial risk. These risk surfaces were weighed and integrated into a ""risk map of superspreading environment"" (SE-risk map) at the city level. Overall, the proposed method can estimate empirical hot spots of superspreading environment with statistical accuracy. The SE-risk map of Hong Kong can pre-identify areas that overlap with the actual disease clusters of bar-related transmission. Our study presents first-of-its-kind research that combines data on facility location and human mobility to identify superspreading environment. The resultant SE-risk map steers the investigation away from pure human focus to include geographic environment, thereby enabling more differentiated non-pharmaceutical interventions and exit strategies to target some places more than others when complete city lockdown is not practicable.","Loo, Becky P Y; Tsoi, Ka Ho; Wong, Paulina P Y; Lai, Poh Chin",Sci Rep,382,20

However, the physiological demands of singing and its intensity as a physical activity are not well understood. METHODS: We compared cardiorespiratory parameters while completing components of Singing for Lung Health sessions, with treadmill walking at differing speeds (2, 4 and 6 km/hour). RESULTS: Eight healthy adults were included, none of whom reported regular participation in formal singing activities. Singing induced acute physiological responses that were consistent with moderate intensity activity (metabolic equivalents: median 4.12, IQR 2.72-4.78), with oxygen consumption, heart rate and volume per breath above those seen walking at 4 km/hour. Minute ventilation was higher during singing (median 22.42 L/min, IQR 16.83-30.54) than at rest (11 L/min, 9-13), lower than 6 km/hour walking (30.35 L/min, 26.94-41.11), but not statistically different from 2 km/hour (18.77 L/min, 16.89-21.35) or 4 km/hour (23.27 L/min, 20.09-26.37) walking. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest the acute metabolic demands of singing are comparable with walking at a moderately brisk pace, hence, physical effects may contribute to the health and well-being benefits attributed to singing participation. However, if physical training benefits result remains uncertain. Further research including different singing styles, singers and physical performance impacts when used as a training modality is encouraged.

Namibia is not spared from this disease. On the early days of the pandemic in Namibia, the government instituted a four-stage strategy--from a full lockdown in Stage One with gradual relaxation of restrictions in Stage Two and ending with Stage Four. This was proven to be effective since the number of daily new cases were minimal by the time the restrictions were lifted in Stage Four, which allowed many non-essential businesses to resume, and borders to reopen. However, following this, the cases jumped in an alarming pace. The situation was also exacerbated partly by obliviousness of the people to restrictions due to their economic issues. At present, the government struggles to bring the situation back under control. Thus, the government reintroduced new restrictions to mitigate the situation. The country is facing paucity of facilities like personal protective equipment (PPE), health workers, intensive care unit (ICU) equipment and testing kits. To avoid further explosion of cases, Namibia needs to determine relaxation of restrictions based on the indicators of the situation of COVID-19. Assistance to the population and addressing insufficiency of facilities by the government through innovative solutions are of utmost importance in tussling the virus.","Amesho, Josephine Ndapewoshali; Ahmadi, Attaullah; Lucero-Prisno Iii, Don Eliseo",Pan Afr Med J,382,20

Action Observation Treatment is effective in the rehabilitation of several neurological diseases. In this pilot study, we used Action Observation Treatment in a telerehabilitation setting in children with Cerebral Palsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten children with Cerebral Palsy, aged 5-12 years, entered the study. They followed the Action Observation Treatment rehabilitation program at home with remote supervision by a child neurologist located at the hospital. Outcome measures were the scores at the Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function Scale and the Assisting Hand Assessment. RESULTS: Scores obtained after treatment and at a two months' follow-up significantly differed from baseline and overlapped those obtained in randomized controlled studies carried out in a conventional setting. CONCLUSIONS: Action Observation Treatment is therefore a promising approach that can be used on a large scale in a telerehabilitation setting. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Tele-rehabilitation has the potential to enhance early intervention service provision for children with Cerebral Palsy. Action Observation Treatment has the potential to become a routine approach in a telerehabilitation setting.","Molinaro, Anna; Micheletti, Serena; Pagani, Federica; Garofalo, Gioacchino; Galli, Jessica; Rossi, Andrea; Fazzi, Elisa; Buccino, Giovanni",Disabil Rehabil,382,27

The COVID-19 virus spreads when a person comes into contact with an affected individual. This is mainly through drops of saliva or nasal discharge. Most of the affected people have mild symptoms while some people develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which damages organs like the lungs and heart. Chest X-rays (CXRs) have been widely used to identify abnormalities that help in detecting the COVID-19 virus. They have also been used as an initial screening procedure for individuals highly suspected of being infected. However, the availability of radiographic CXRs is still scarce. This can limit the performance of deep learning (DL) based approaches for COVID-19 detection. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we developed an Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (ACGAN), to generate CXRs. Each generated X-ray belongs to one of the two classes COVID-19 positive or normal. To ensure the goodness of the synthetic images, we performed some experimentation on the obtained images using the latest Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect COVID-19 in the CXRs. We fine-tuned the models and achieved more than 98% accuracy. After that, we also performed feature selection using the Harmony Search (HS) algorithm, which reduces the number of features while retaining classification accuracy. We further release a GAN-generated dataset consisting of 500 COVID-19 radiographic images.","Karbhari, Yash Basu Arpan Geem Zong-Woo Han Gi-Tae Sarkar Ram",Diagnostics,382,18

Almost all countries started to take proactive precautionary measures to reduce the risk of contracting the virus. The education sector, including pharmacy education, has been drastically impacted by this pandemic. During the outbreak, many hospitals instructed the health profession's schools to restrict or prevent the presence of their students and interns in their hospitals in an effort to limit the spread of the virus. Objectives: Constraining the presence of interns in the affiliated hospital has impacted the integrity of delivering the learning outcomes of each clinical rotation. In this paper, we present the experience of four faculty preceptors in restructuring the advanced pharmacy practice experience in different clinical settings, including critical care, infectious diseases, cardiology, and internal medicine, in order to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19 at a large academic medical institution in Saudi Arabia. Conclusion: We believe that this experience could provide guidance and insights for other pharmacy schools dealing with this issue during this global pandemic.","Badreldin, Hisham A; Alshaya, Omar; Saleh, Khalid Bin; Alshaya, Abdulrahman I",,382,24

Healthcare workers are at the forefront of such pressures resulting from a persistent threat to their safety and well being. It is therefore important to study such mechanisms that can influence and predict the psychological distress of nurses OBJECTIVES: While there is an increasing number of studies on positive outcomes of leadership styles, their influence on curbing unwanted adverse outcomes is scarce. This study aims to observe the influence of an inclusive leadership style on psychological distress while assessing the mediating role of psychological safety. It uses the theoretical lens of job demands-resources theory and the theory of shattered assumptions to develop and test hypotheses. DESIGN: Cross-Sectional Study with Temporal Separation SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: The researchers recruited 451 on-duty registered nurses from 5 hospitals providing patient care during the highly infectious phase of COVID-19 in January 2020 in Wuhan city, the epicentre of the outbreak in China METHODS: After obtaining permission from hospital administration, data were collected through an online questionnaire survey in three stages with temporal separation to avoid common method bias. Partial least square structural equation modelling was used to analyze data. The study controlled for effects of age, gender, experience, working hours and education. RESULTS: Hypothesized relationships proved significant. Inclusive leadership has an inverse relationship with psychological distress with a strong path-coefficient. Psychological safety mediates the relationship between inclusive leadership and psychological distress while explaining 28.6% variance. Multi-group analysis results indicate no significant differences between respondents based on these control variables CONCLUSIONS: Recurring or prolonged experiences of stress and anxiety at the workplace, without a mechanism to counter such effects, can culminate into psychological distress. Inclusive leadership style can serve as such a mechanism to curb psychological distress for healthcare workers by creating a psychologically safe environment.","Zhao, Fuqiang; Ahmed, Fawad; Faraz, Naveed Ahmad",Int J Nurs Stud,382,29

We use an age-stratified eight compartment epidemiological model to depict COVID-19 transmission in the community and within households. With a simulated 120-day outbreak period data we obtain a post 180-days period optimal control strategy solution. Our results show that easing social distancing between adults by the end of the 180-day period requires very strict testing a month later and then daily testing rates of 5% followed by isolation of positive cases. Relaxing social distancing rates in adults from 50% to 25% requires both children and seniors to maintain social distancing rates of 50% for nearly the entire period while maintaining maximum testing rates of children and seniors for 150 of the 180 days considered in this model. Children have higher contact rates which leads to transmission based on our model, emphasizing the need for caution when considering school reopenings.","Vatcheva, Kristina P.; Sifuentes, Josef Oraby Tamer Maldonado Jose Campo Huber Timothy Villalobos María Cristina",Infectious Disease Modelling,382,17

These restrictions progressively produced changes to social behavior and global mobility patterns, evidently disrupting social and economic activities. Here, using maritime traffic data, collected via a global network of Automatic Identification System (AIS) receivers, we analyze the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic and the containment measures had on the shipping industry, which accounts alone for more than 80% of the world trade. We introduce the notion of a""maritime mobility index,""a synthetic composite index, to quantitatively assess ship mobility in a given unit of time. The mobility index calculation used in this study, has a worldwide extent and is based on the computation of cumulative navigated miles (CNM) of all ships reporting their position and navigational status via AIS. We compare 2020 mobility levels to those of previous years assuming that an unchanged growth rate would have been achieved, if not for COVID-19. Following the outbreak, we find an unprecedented drop in maritime mobility, across all categories of commercial shipping. The reduced activity is observable from March to June, when the most severe restrictions were in force, producing a variation of mobility quantified between -5.62% and -13.77% for container ships, between +2.28% and -3.32% for dry bulk, between -0.22% and -9.27% for wet bulk, and between -19.57% and -42.77% for passenger shipping. The presented study is unprecedented for the uniqueness and completeness of the employed AIS dataset, which comprises a trillion AIS messages broadcast worldwide by 50000 ships, a figure that closely parallels the documented size of the world merchant fleet.","Millefiori, Leonardo M.; Braca, Paolo; Zissis, Dimitris; Spiliopoulos, Giannis; Marano, Stefano; Willett, Peter K.; Carniel, Sandro",,382,1

By drug repurposing, affordable therapeutics could be supplied worldwide in the present pandemic context. Targeting the nucleoprotein N of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus could be a strategy to impede viral replication and possibly other essential functions associated with viral N. The antiviral properties of naproxen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that was previously demonstrated to be active against Influenza A virus, were evaluated against SARS-CoV-2. Intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy, fluorescence anisotropy, and dynamic light scattering assays demonstrated naproxen binding to the nucleoprotein of SARS-Cov-2 as predicted by molecular modeling. Naproxen impeded recombinant N oligomerization and inhibited viral replication in infected cells. In VeroE6 cells and reconstituted human primary respiratory epithelium models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, naproxen specifically inhibited viral replication and protected the bronchial epithelia against SARS-CoV-2-induced damage. No inhibition of viral replication was observed with paracetamol or the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib. Thus, among the NSAID tested, only naproxen combined antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. Naproxen addition to the standard of care could be beneficial in a clinical setting, as tested in an ongoing clinical study.","Terrier, Olivier; Dilly, Sébastien; Pizzorno, Andrés; Chalupska, Dominika; Humpolickova, Jana; Boura, Evzen; Berenbaum, Francis; Quideau, Stéphane; Lina, Bruno; Fève, Bruno; Adnet, Frédéric; Sabbah, Michèle; Rosa-Calatrava, Manuel; Maréchal, Vincent; Henri, Julien; Slama-Schwok, Anny",Molecules (Basel),382,16

Many of these women are of working age. Previous research has shown associations between unhealthy eating behaviors and occupational stress or burnout. However, no previous study has explored the association between disordered eating and work engagement, a positive, fulfilling, affective-cognitive state of mind which has been positioned as the conceptual opposite of burnout. Thus, that was the aim of the present study. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a sample of 701 Swedish women completed the 9-item Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES-9) and the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q). They were divided into a Healthy Eating (HE) and a Disordered Eating (DE) group based on their EDE-Q scores. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to test the association between disordered eating and work engagement. The Kruskal Wallis test was used to assess the associations between educational level, marital status and age group, and work engagement. RESULTS: Neither the UWES scores nor the EDE-Q scores were found to have a normal distribution. Non-parametric testing showed that the DE group reported significantly lower work engagement than the HE group (p = 0.016). There were no significant associations between education, marital status or age (independent variables) and work engagement (dependent variable) (p = 0.826, 0.309, and 0.349, respectively). CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that work engagement may play a role in disordered eating, and that there is a need for future research to consider the workplace environment as a potential source for altering disordered eating behaviors.","Willmer, Mikaela; Westerberg Jacobson, Josefin; Lindberg, Magnus",BMC Womens Health,382,1

Effective nursing care includes actions to develop nurse-patient relationships and deliver physical and psychosocial care to patients. The high risk of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus compromises nursing care. No evidence-based nursing guidelines exist for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, leading to potential variations in patient experience, outcomes, quality and costs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: we aim to recruit 840 in-patient participants treated for infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus from 14 UK hospitals, to a cluster randomised controlled trial, with embedded process and economic evaluations, of care as usual and a fundamental nursing care protocol addressing specific areas of physical, relational and psychosocial nursing care where potential variation may occur, compared with care as usual. Our coprimary outcomes are patient-reported experience (Quality from the Patients' Perspective; Relational Aspects of Care Questionnaire); secondary outcomes include care quality (pressure injuries, falls, medication errors); functional ability (Barthell Index); treatment outcomes (WHO Clinical Progression Scale); depression Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), anxiety General Anxiety Disorder-2 (GAD-2), health utility (EQ5D) and nurse-reported outcomes (Measure of Moral Distress for Health Care Professionals). For our primary analysis, we will use a standard generalised linear mixed-effect model adjusting for ethnicity of the patient sample and research intensity at cluster level. We will also undertake a planned subgroup analysis to compare the impact of patient-level ethnicity on our primary and secondary outcomes and will undertake process and economic evaluations.

Media surveillance is useful to capture unstructured information about outbreaks. We established media surveillance and described the characteristics of the COVID-19 cases, clusters, deaths by time, place, and person during January-March 2020 in India. Methods: The media surveillance team of ICMR-National Institute of Epidemiology abstracted data from public domains of India's Central and State health ministries, online news and social media platforms for the period of January 31 to March 26, 2020. We collected data on person (socio-demographics, circumstances of travel/contact, clinical and laboratory), time (date/period of reported exposures; laboratory confirmation and death) and place (location). We drew epidemic curve, described frequencies of cases by age and gender. We described available details for identified clusters. Results: As of March 26, 2020, India reported 694 (Foreigners = 45, 6%) confirmed COVID-19 cases (Attack rate = 0.5 per million population) and 17 deaths (Fatality = 2.5%) from 21 States and 6 Union Territories. The cases were higher among 20-59 years of age (60 of 85) and male gender (65 of 107). Median age at death was 68 years (Range: 38-85 years). We identified 13 clusters with a total of 63 cases and four deaths among the first 200 cases. Conclusion: Surveillance of media sources was useful in characterizing the epidemic in the early phase. Hence, media surveillance should be integrated in the routine surveillance systems to map the events specially in context of new disease outbreaks.","Jahan, Nuzrath; Rubeshkumar, Polani; Karuppiah, Mathan; Sambath, Irene; Sendhilkumar, Muthappan; Ilangovan, Kumaravel; Ongesh, Roopavathi; Sakthivel, Manikandanesan; Mohankumar, Raju; Santhosh Kumar, Muthusamy; Ganeshkumar, Parasuraman; Ponnaiah, Manickam; Kaur, Prabhdeep",,382,27

METHODS: Seventy-six older adults (Nâ¯=â¯46 with PTSD and Nâ¯=â¯30 trauma-exposed comparison subjects [TE]) for whom prepandemic data were available were interviewed between April 1 and May 8, 2020 to quantify depressive (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HRSD]) and PTSD symptom (Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist [PCL-5]) levels. Group differences in baseline characteristics as well as pre-post pandemic symptom levels were examined, and participant characteristics were assessed as moderators of symptom change. RESULTS: Compared to TEs, individuals with PTSD more often reported living alone and experiencing a physical illness (&#967;2â¯=â¯5.1, dfâ¯=â¯1, pâ¯=â¯0.02). PCL-5 scores among individuals with PTSD decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic by 7.1 points (t(69)â¯=â¯-3.5, pâ¯=â¯0.0008), whereas the TE group did not change significantly. Overall no significant differences in HRSD were found between groups, but a race or ethnicity variable was found to moderate HRSD symptom change. Non-black or Hispanic individuals with PTSD experienced significantly increased HRSD scores during the pandemic compared to black or Hispanic PTSD participants.

METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis conducted at the Hospital Clinico San Carlos in Madrid, Spain. Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 that were attended in the Emergency Department (ED) from March 23 to March 29, 2020 were included. Fundus examination and OCTA were performed 4 weeks after being attended in ED. Macular OCTA parameters were analyzed and correlated with clinical (severity and hypoxemia- oxygen saturation<92%) and laboratory parameters during hospital stay (D-Dimer-DD, lactate dehydrogenase-LDH and C-reactive protein-CRP). RESULTS: 80 patients were included, mean age 55(SD9) years old; 46.3% male. We reported macular vessel density and perfusion measurements in COVID-19 patients. Those patients with D-Dimer&#8805;500ng/ml during SARS-CoV-2 infection had a decrease of central vessel density (mean difference 2.2; 95%CI 0.4-3.9) and perfusion density (mean difference 4.9; 95%CI 0.9-8.9) after the acute phase of COVID-19. These variations of vessel density and perfusion density were not documented in patients with LDH&#8805;500U/L, CRP&#8805;10mg/L and hypoxemia. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients showed short-term retinal vasculature abnormalities which may be related to a prothrombotic state associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since the retinal microvasculature shares many morphological and physiological properties with the vasculature of other vital organs, further research is needed to establish whether patients with increased D-Dimer levels require more careful assessment and follow-up after COVID-19.","Guemes-Villahoz, Noemi; Burgos-Blasco, Barbara; Vidal-Villegas, Beatriz; Donate-López, Juan; Martín-Sánchez, Francisco Javier; Porta-Etessam, Jesús; López-Guajardo, Lorenzo; Martín, José Luis R; González-Armengol, Juan Jorge; García-Feijoó, Julián",Med. clin (Ed. impr.),382,16

However, inability to access these cells from patients, particularly at early stages of disease, limits an understanding of disease inception. Here, we present an in vitro human model that simulates the initial apical infection of alveolar epithelium with SARS-CoV-2 by using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived AT2s that have been adapted to air-liquid interface culture. We find a rapid transcriptomic change in infected cells, characterized by a shift to an inflammatory phenotype with upregulation of NF-&#954;B signaling and loss of the mature alveolar program. Drug testing confirms the efficacy of remdesivir as well as TMPRSS2 protease inhibition, validating a putative mechanism used for viral entry in alveolar cells. Our model system reveals cell-intrinsic responses of a key lung target cell to SARS-CoV-2 infection and should facilitate drug development.","Huang, Jessie; Hume, Adam J; Abo, Kristine M; Werder, Rhiannon B; Villacorta-Martin, Carlos; Alysandratos, Konstantinos-Dionysios; Beermann, Mary Lou; Simone-Roach, Chantelle; Lindstrom-Vautrin, Jonathan; Olejnik, Judith; Suder, Ellen L; Bullitt, Esther; Hinds, Anne; Sharma, Arjun; Bosmann, Markus; Wang, Ruobing; Hawkins, Finn; Burks, Eric J; Saeed, Mohsan; Wilson, Andrew A; Mühlberger, Elke; Kotton, Darrell N",Cell stem cell (Online),382,1

METHODS: We conducted a small sample, single arm, pilot trial. In addition to standard therapy, we performed four rounds of transplantation of UC-MSCs in sixteen patients with severe and critically severe COVID-19. We recorded adverse events from enrolment to Day 28. We evaluated the oxygenation index, inflammatory biomarkers, radiological presentations of the disease and lymphocyte subsets count on the 7th day (D7 ± 1 day), the 14th day (D14 ± 1 day) and the 28th day (D28 ± 3 days). RESULTS: There were no infusion-related or allergic reactions. The oxygenation index was improved after transplantation. The mortality of enrolled patients was 6.25%, whereas the historical mortality rate was 45.4%. The level of cytokines estimated varied in the normal range, the radiological presentations (ground glass opacity) were improved and the lymphocyte count and lymphocyte subsets (CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and NK cells) count showed recovery after transplantation.

BACKGROUND: We previously reported a 38% decline in cardiac catheterization activations during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic mitigation measures. This study extends our early observations using a larger sample of STEMI programs representative of different US regions with the inclusion of more contemporary data. METHODS: Data from 18 hospitals or healthcare systems in the US from January 2019 to April 2020 were collecting including number activations for STEMI, the number of activations leading to angiography and primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI), and average door to balloon (D2B) times. Two periods, January 2019-February 2020 and March-April 2020, were defined to represent periods before (BC) and after (AC) initiation of pandemic mitigation measures, respectively. A generalized estimating equations approach was used to estimate the change in response variables at AC from BC. RESULTS: Compared to BC, the AC period was characterized by a marked reduction in the number of activations for STEMI (29%, 95% CI:18-38, p < .001), number of activations leading to angiography (34%, 95% CI: 12-50, p = .005) and number of activations leading to PPCI (20%, 95% CI: 11-27, p < .001). A decline in STEMI activations drove the reductions in angiography and PPCI volumes. Relative to BC, the D2B times in the AC period increased on average by 20%, 95%CI (-0.2 to 44, p = .05). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 Pandemic has adversely affected many aspects of STEMI care, including timely access to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for PPCI.","Garcia, Santiago; Stanberry, Larissa; Schmidt, Christian; Sharkey, Scott; Megaly, Michael; Albaghdadi, Mazen S; Meraj, Perwaiz M; Garberich, Ross; Jaffer, Farouc A; Stefanescu Schmidt, Ada C; Dixon, Simon R; Rade, Jeffrey J; Smith, Timothy; Tannenbaum, Mark; Chambers, Jenny; Aguirre, Frank; Huang, Paul P; Kumbhani, Dharam J; Koshy, Thomas; Feldman, Dmitriy N; Giri, Jay; Kaul, Prashant; Thompson, Craig; Khalili, Houman; Maini, Brij; Nayak, Keshav R; Cohen, Mauricio G; Bangalore, Sripal; Shah, Binita; Henry, Timothy D",Catheter. cardiovasc. interv,382,32

Afucosylated IgG variants are already used in anti-cancer therapeutic antibodies for their elevated activity through Fc receptors (FcÎ³RIIIa). Here, we report that afucosylated IgG (~6% of total IgG in humans) are specifically formed against enveloped viruses but generally not against other antigens. This mediates stronger FcÎ³RIIIa responses, but also amplifies brewing cytokine storms and immune-mediated pathologies. Critically ill COVID-19 patients, but not those with mild symptoms, had high levels of afucosylated IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, amplifying pro-inflammatory cytokine release and acute phase responses.

A plethora of studies, globally, have suggested the existence of a sex disparity in the outcome of COVID-19 patients, that is mainly due to mechanisms of viral infection, immune response to the virus, development of a hyperinflammation, and development of systemic complications, particularly thromboembolism. These differences appear to be more pronounced in elderly COVID-19 patients. Epidemiological data report a sex difference in the severity and outcome of COVID-19 disease with a more favourable course of the disease in women compared to men, regardless of age range although the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to be similar in both sexes. Sex hormones, including androgens and estrogens, may not only impact viral entry and load, but also shape the clinical manifestations, complications and, ultimately, the outcome of COVID-19 disease. The current review comprehensively summarizes current literature on sex disparities in susceptibility and outcomes of COVID-19 disease as well as the literature underpinning the pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms, which may provide a rationale to a sex disparity. These include sex hormone influences on molecules that facilitate virus entry and priming, as well as the immune and inflammatory response, as well as coagulation and thrombosis diathesis. Based on present evidence, women appear to be relatively protected from COVID-19 because of a more effective immune response and a less pronounced systemic inflammation, with consequent moderate clinical manifestations of the disease, together with a lesser predisposition to thromboembolism. Conversely, men appear to be particularly susceptible to COVID-19 disease because of a less effective immune response with consequent increased susceptibility to infections, together with a greater predisposition to thromboembolism. In elderlies, sex disparities in overall mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection is even more palpable, as elderly men appear more prone to severe COVID-19 because of a greater predisposition to infections, a weaker immune defence and an enhanced thrombotic state compared to women. The review highlights potential novel therapeutic approaches employing the administration of hormonal or anti-hormonal therapy in combination with antiviral drugs in COVID-19 patients.","Pivonello, Rosario; Auriemma, Renata S; Pivonello, Claudia; Isidori, Andrea M; Corona, Giovanni; Colao, Annamaria; Millar, Robert P",Neuroendocrinology,382,20

To date, there is no curative treatment for COVID-19, and with vaccines only recently being rolled out predominantly in wealthy countries, prevention still remains the main strategy. Social distancing has been proven to mitigate the epidemic and limit disease spread. As is the case in many other countries, the Ethiopian government has declared a state of emergency and taken several measures to impose social distancing. The level of compliance with social distancing measures in Ethiopia is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the compliance, barriers, and facilitators to social distancing measures for the prevention of COVID-19 in Northwest Ethiopia. Methods: A cross-sectional survey using telephone interview triangulated by a qualitative study was conducted over a period of one month from April 20th to May 20th, 2020 at the University of Gondar Hospital in Gondar, Ethiopia. A total of 401 randomly selected participants, and 12 key representative informants selected by convenience were included for the quantitative and qualitative studies, respectively. Information on socio-demographic factors, knowledge about COVID-19, and practices concerning preventive measures--particularly social distancing--was collected. Respondents were asked what they thought were the barriers and facilitators of social distancing during in-depth face-to-face interviews. Data were entered and analyzed using Epi-data and Stata software, respectively. Frequencies and odds ratios were analyzed. P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant, and a confidence level of 95% strength of association was used. Results: A total of 425 study subjects were approached and 401 responded positively (response rate of 94.4%). Of the 401 study participants, 55.4% (95% CI 50.4, 60.2) reported poor compliance with social distancing measures. The mean age of the participants was 36.4 years (SD ± 11.8). The majority of participants (63.84%) reported that they went to crowded places without putting on a face mask. Of the participants, 243 (60.6%) and 306 (76.3%) had good knowledge on COVID-19 transmission and prevention, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that only age (AOR= 1.02, 95% CI: 1.00-1.04) was significantly associated with social distancing measures, with older persons more likely than younger to comply with social distancing guidelines. Conclusion: The majority of the study's participants reported poor compliance with social distancing measures set by the government and health authorities. Reported compliance with social distancing measures was increased with increasing age.","Hailu, Workagegnehu; Derseh, Lemma; Hunegnaw, Melkamu Tamir; Tesfaye, Tsebaot; Abebaw, Dessie",Curr Ther Res Clin Exp,382,30

Hence, the Tele-Exercise and Multiple Sclerosis (TEAMS) study aims to provide patient-centered, coordinated care by implementing a 12-week complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) intervention for adults with MS. However, due to the societal impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in mid-March 2020, the University of Alabama at Birmingham announced a limited business model halting all nonessential research requiring on-site visits, which includes the TEAMS study. OBJECTIVE: In compliance with the shelter-in-place policy and quarantine guidance, a modified testing and training protocol was developed to allow participants to continue the study. METHODS: The modified protocol, which replaces on-site data collection and training procedures, includes a teleassessment package (computer tablet, blood pressure cuff, hand dynamometer, mini disc cone, measuring tape, an 8"" step, and a large-print 8"" × 11"" paper with ruler metrics and wall-safe tape) and a virtual meeting platform for synchronous interactive training between the therapist and the participant. The teleassessment measures include resting blood pressure and heart rate, grip strength, Five Times Sit to Stand, Timed Up & Go, and the Berg Balance Scale. The teletraining component includes 20 sessions of synchronous training sessions of dual tasking, yoga, and Pilates exercises designed and customized for a range of functional levels. Teletraining lasts 12 weeks and participants are instructed to continue exercising for a posttraining period of 9 months. RESULTS: The protocol modifications were supported with supplemental funding (from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute) and approved by the University Institutional Review Board for Human Use. At the time nonessential research visits were halted by the university, there were 759 people enrolled and baseline tested, accounting for 92.5% of our baseline testing completion target (N=820). Specifically, 325 participants completed the 12-week intervention and follow-up testing visits, and 289 participants needed to complete either the intervention or follow-up assessments. A modified analysis plan will include sensitivity analyses to ensure the robustness of the study results in the presence of uncertainty and protocol deviations. Study results are projected to be published in 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This modified remote teleassessment/teletraining protocol will impact a large number of participants with MS who would otherwise have been discontinued from the study.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of surgical procedures carried out at 39 Academic hospitals. A distinction was made between elective and urgent procedures. Intravitreal injections were also considered. Percentages for all surgical procedures and incidence rate ratios (IRR) for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) events were calculated. A p value <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: A total of 20,886 versus 55,259 and 56,640 patients underwent surgery during the lockdown versus intra-and inter-year control periods, respectively. During the lockdown, only 70% of patients for whom an operation/intravitreal injection was recommended, finally underwent surgery; the remaining patients did not attend because afraid of getting infected at the hospital (23%), taking public transportation (6.5%), or unavailable swabs (0.5%). Elective surgeries were reduced by 96.2% and 96.4%, urgent surgeries by 49.7% and 50.2%, and intravitreal injections by 48.5% and 48.6% in the lockdown period in comparison to intra-year and inter-year control periods, respectively. IRRs for RRDs during lockdown dropped significantly in comparison with intra- and inter-year control periods (CI: 0.65-0.80 and 0.61-0.75, respectively, p < 0.001 for both). CONCLUSION: This study provides a quantitative analysis of the reduction of eye surgical procedures performed in Italy because of the COVID-19 epidemic.","dell039,; Omo, Roberto; Filippelli, Mariaelena; Virgili, Gianni; Bandello, Francesco; Querques, Giuseppe; Lanzetta, Paolo; Avitabile, Teresio; Viola, Francesco; Reibaldi, Michele; Semeraro, Francesco; Quaranta, Luciano; Rizzo, Stanislao; Midena, Edoardo; Campagna, Giuseppe; Costagliola, Ciro",Eur J Ophthalmol,382,16

We tested the utility of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to classify and predict the severity of COVID-19. Methods: We used MALDI-TOF MS to analyze the serum peptidome from 72 patients with COVID-19 (training cohort), clinically classified as mild (28), severe (23), and critical (21), and 20 healthy controls. The resulting matrix of peak intensities was used for Machine Learning (ML) approaches to classify and predict COVID-19 severity of 22 independent patients (validation cohort). Finally, we analyzed all sera by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify the most relevant proteins associated with disease severity. Results: We found a clear variability of the serum peptidome profile depending on COVID-19 severity. Forty-two peaks exhibited a log fold change &gt;=1 and 17 were significantly different and at least 4-fold more intense in the set of critical patients than in the mild ones. The ML approach classified clinical stable patients according to their severity with 100% accuracy and correctly predicted the evolution of the nonstable patients in all cases. The LC-MS/MS identified 5 proteins that were significantly upregulated in the critical patients. They included the serum amyloid protein A2, which probably yielded the most intense peak detected by MALDI-TOF MS. Conclusions: We demonstrate the potential of the MALDI-TOF MS as a bench to bedside technology to aid clinicians in their decision making regarding patients with COVID-19.","Gomila, R.

OBJECTIVE: This study reports on the use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) to treat NPS associated with COVID-19. METHODS: A review of the literature pertaining to the use of ECT in patients with COVID-19 and NPS was performed through PubMed, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE. Search terms included ""Electroconvulsive Therapy"" and ""ECT,"" combined with ""COVID-19"" and ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2)."" In addition, we present a case in which ECT was used to achieve complete remission in a patient who developed new onset, treatment-resistant depression, psychosis, and catatonia, associated with COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 67 articles were reviewed with 3 selected for inclusion. These articles detailed 3 case reports of patients with new onset NPS (mania, psychosis and suicidality, and catatonia) that developed in the context of active COVID-19 and were treated successfully with ECT. CONCLUSIONS: ECT, a broad-spectrum treatment that has been found to be effective in various NPS (independent of etiology), is shown in our case report and others, to be safe and effective for NPS associated with COVID-19. Although we identified only 3 other cases in the literature, we believe that the probable antiinflammatory mechanism of ECT, its safety and tolerability, and the faster time to symptom remission support the need for more research and increased clinician awareness about this life-saving procedure.","Austgen, Gabriela; Meyers, Matthew S; Gordon, Mollie; Livingston, Robin",,382,16

Rehabilitation coordinators, a new function in Swedish healthcare, support people in the RTW process. The present study had two aims: to explore what problems and barriers people with multimorbidity experience during their rehabilitation and RTW process and to explore in which domains the coordinators’ support is perceived to be of importance. Methods: Interviews were conducted with 12 persons with multimorbidity who had contact with a rehabilitation coordinator during their sickness absence. Thematic analysis was guided by the case-management ecological model;this analysis was revised and adapted to the Swedish context. Results: The participants experienced problems in all domains of the model, namely: “the healthcare system”, “the labor market and the workplace system”, “the sickness insurance system”, and “the personal system”. Rehabilitation programs that did not accommodate combinations of diseases, social complexities and needs were felt to lead to worse symptoms, thus hindering rather than promoting RTW. An overall finding regarding support by coordinators is that interventions, regardless of domain, were felt to be valuable for people with multimorbidity. The coordinator was perceived to give most support by providing advice about and coordination with healthcare and employers. Sometimes the coordinator gave advice and coordination regarding the Social Insurance Agency, very occasionally the Public Employment Services. The coordinator gave least advice and coordination about social difficulties that hindered rehabilitation and RTW processes. Conclusion: People with multimorbidity perceive rehabilitation coordinator interventions as important in all domains investigated. Lack of advice and coordination, or rehabilitation programs that were not modified to the complexities of individual’s circumstances, were associated with prolonged sickness absence, worse health, or social risk factors not being recognized.","Svärd, Veronica Friberg Emilie Azad Azadé",Journal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare,382,16

Methods: Using US Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Wave 1 data (2013-2014), we investigated the mean knowledge of diseases due to smoking and perceptions of harm of cigarettes scores among cigarette smokers (n = 8,263), e-cigarette users (n = 829), and dual users (n = 745) and examined the association between knowledge, perceptions of harm and intention to quit. Results: E-cigarette users had the highest scores in both knowledge and perceptions of harm items. We found a stronger association between knowledge and intention to quit among females (aOR: 1.25; 95% CI: 1.18, 1.34) compared to males (aOR: 1.11; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.18). We observed a strong association between perceptions of harm and intention to quit among cigarette smokers (p < 0.0001) and dual users (p = 0.0001), but not e-cigarette users. Conclusions: Our study indicates it is urgent for federal and state governments to develop comprehensive guidelines for targeted health messaging regarding the harms of cigarettes, noncombustible tobacco products, and dual use, and the benefits of cessation. Further, findings suggest that effective health education should include tobacco product-specific risks and the comprehensive negative health impacts of tobacco given the strong positive association of perceptions of harm and intention to quit.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/10826084.2021.1879145.","Lin, Wenxue; Martinez, Sydney A; Ding, Kai; Beebe, Laura A",Subst Use Misuse,382,29

For 15% of cases, neovascularization occurs, leading to acute vision loss if left untreated. For the remaining patients, there are currently no treatment options and preventing progressive RPE atrophy remains the main therapeutic goal. Previously, we have shown treatment with interleukin-33 can reduce choroidal neovascularization and attenuate tissue remodelling. Here, we investigate IL-33 delivery in aged, high-fat diet (HFD) fed mice on a wildtype and complement factor H heterozygous knockout background. We characterize the non-toxic effect following intravitreal injection of IL-33 and further demonstrate protective effects against RPE cell death with evidence of maintaining metabolic retinal homeostasis of Cfh+/-~HFD mice. Our results further support the potential utility of IL-33 to prevent AMD progression.","Clare, Alison J; Copland, David A; Nicholson, Lindsay B; Liu, Jian; Neal, Chris R; Moss, Stephen; Dick, Andrew D; Theodoropoulou, Sofia",J. cell. mol. med,382,1

While PD techniques are well described, there is uncertainty about how to determine the amount of PD to be prescribed toward a target dose. The aim of this study is to derive practical equations to assist with the prescription of PD for AKI. METHODS: Using established physiological principles behind PD clearance and membrane transport, a primary determinant of dose delivery, equations were mathematically derived to estimate dialysate volume required to achieve a target dose of PD. RESULTS: The main derivative equation is VD = (1.2 × std-Kt/V × TBW)/(t dwell + 4), where VD is the total dialysate volume per day, std-Kt/V is the desired weekly dose, TBW is the total body water, and t dwell is the dwell time. VD can be expressed in terms of dwell volume, v dwell, by VD = (0.3 × std-Kt/V × TBW) - (6 × v dwell). Two further equations were derived which directly describe the mathematical relationship between t dwell and v dwell. A calculator is included as an Online Supplementary Material. CONCLUSIONS: The equations are intended as a practical tool to estimate solute clearances and guide prescription of continuous PD. The estimated dialysate volume required for any dose target can be calculated from cycle duration or dwell volume. However, the exact target dose of PD is uncertain and should be adjusted according to the clinical circumstances and response to treatment. The equations presented in this article facilitate the adjustment of PD prescription toward the targeted solute clearance.","Chionh, Chang Yin; Finkelstein, Fredric O; Ronco, Claudio",Perit Dial Int,382,32

It is not known if different treatment modalities are associated with more profound growth impairment. Our aim was to compare differences in weight gain at 36 weeks' corrected gestational age (CGA) in premature infants that received medical, surgical or conservative management for PDA. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed notes of 208 infants born under 30 weeks' gestation with a diagnosis of PDA. Gestational age (GA) at birth, birth weight z-score, CGA and weight z-score at 36 weeks' CGA were collected. In our cohort, surgical closure was performed in infants who remained symptomatic after medical or conservative management. RESULTS: Ninety-four infants had medical, 56 surgical and 58 conservative management. Surgically managed infants had a lower median (IQR) GA [24.4 (24.0-26.1) weeks'] than medically [25.4 (24.6-26.5) weeks'] or conservatively managed [26.4 (25.4-28.1) weeks', p < 0.001] infants. There was no difference in birth weight z-scores across the groups. Surgically managed infants demonstrated a greater decrease in weight z-score [-2.24 (-2.89 to -1.53)] compared to medically [-1.79 (-2.45 to -1.35)] and conservatively [-1.57 (-1.99 to -1.28), p < 0.001] managed infants between birth and 36 weeks' CGA. After adjusting for GA at birth, definitive treatment modality was significantly related to change in weight z-score from birth to 36 weeks' CGA (adjusted p = 0.022). CONCLUSION: Premature infants with PDA who were managed surgically had a greater degree of faltering growth compared to those who were treated medically or conservatively.","Babla, Kunal; Dassios, Theodore; Pushparajah, Kuberan; Hickey, Ann; Greenough, Anne",Pediatr. neonatol,382,23

Design/methodology/approach: Within a criterion-based sample of eight Latin American private universities, this paper develops in-depth exploratory case studies to examine the prioritization of stakeholders in higher education institutions’ decision-making during the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis. Findings: Contrary to the notion that during crises organizations prioritize stakeholders that provide resources that are critical to survival, this study finds that in contextual crises stakeholder management is informed by social responsibility. In addition, the findings suggest that crises may be tipping points for changes toward mission-driven approaches to governance. Practical implications: Acknowledging the roles of social responsibility and proximity in stakeholder management during contextual crises allows for more informed governance of organizations that face disruptions in their system of stakeholder relations. Originality/value: This study contributes unique insights into the decision-maker’s prioritization of stakeholders during the COVID-19 crisis.

DESIGN: Analysis of the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) and Medicare claims data. SETTINGS/PARTICIPANTS: 6,153 patients &#8805;65 years receiving care from a nonprofit HH agency in 2017. METHODS: Study outcomes included presence of severe pain and time-to-event measures of unplanned facility admissions (hospital, nursing home, or rehabilitation facilities). ADRD was identified using ICD-10 diagnosis codes and cognitive impairment symptoms. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine, respectively, the association between ADRD and severe pain, and the independent and interaction effects of severe pain and ADRD on unplanned facility admission. RESULTS: Patients with ADRD (n = 1,525, 24.8%) were less likely to have recorded severe pain than others (16.4% vs. 23.6%, p < .001). Adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, mental and physical functional status, and use of HH services, having severe pain was related to a 35% increase (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.35, p = .002) in the risk of unplanned facility admission, but the increase in such risk was the same whether or not the patient had ADRD. CONCLUSIONS: HH patients with ADRD may have under-recognized pain. Severe pain is a significant independent predictor of unplanned facility admissions among HH patients.","Wang, Jinjiao; Monroe, Todd B; Simning, Adam; Conwell, Yeates; Caprio, Thomas V; Cai, Xueya; Temkin-Greener, Helena; Muench, Ulrike; Yu, Fang; Ge, Song; Li, Yue",Pain manag. nurs,382,33

However, the global distribution, endemicity, and latitudinal gradients of species richness in mangrove crabs remains poorly understood. Here, we assessed whether species richness of mangrove crabs decreases towards the higher latitudes and tested the importance of environmental factors such as Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in creating the latitudinal gradients in species richness of mangrove crabs. A total of 8262 distribution records of 481 species belonging to six families of mangrove crabs including Camptandriidae, Dotillidae, Macrophthalmidae, Ocypodidae, Sesarmidae, and Oziidae were extracted from open-access databases or collected by the authors, quality controlled, cleaned, and analyzed. Species richness was plotted against 5° latitudinal bands in relation to environmental factors. The R software and ArcGIS 10.6.1 were used to analyze the species latitudinal range and richness as well as to map the distribution of mangrove forest, endemic species, species geographical distribution records, and biogeographic regions. The Indo-West Pacific showed the highest species richness of mangrove crabs where more than 65% of species were found in the Indian Ocean and along the western Pacific Ocean. Our results showed that there are 11 significantly different biogeographic regions of mangrove crabs. The highest endemicity rate was observed in the NW Pacific Ocean (29%). Latitudinal patterns of species richness in Macrophthalmidae, Ocypodidae, and Sesarmidae showed an increasing trend from the poles toward the intermediate latitudes including one dip near the equator. However, latitudinal gradients in Camptandriidae, Dotillidae, and Oziidae were unimodal increasing from the higher latitudes towards the equator. Species richness per 5° latitudinal bands significantly increased following mean SST mean (°C), calcite, euphotic depth (m), and mangrove area (km2) across all latitudes, and tide average within each hemisphere. Species richness significantly decreased with dissolved O2 (ml l-1) and nitrate (µmol l-1) over all latitudes and in the southern hemisphere. The climax of global latitudinal species richness for some mangrove was observed along latitudes 20° N and 15°-25° S, not at the equator. This can suggest that temperature is probably the key driver of latitudinal gradients of mangrove crabs' species richness. Species richness and mangrove area were also highly correlated.","Sharifian, Sana; Kamrani, Ehsan; Saeedi, Hanieh",J Therm Biol,382,1

However, it is not clear whether testing for RNAaemia is correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storms or with the specific class of patients. METHODS: This study enrolled 48 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China. The patients were divided into three groups according to the ""Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (6th edition)"" issued by the National Health Commission of China. The clinical and laboratory data were collected. The serum viral load and IL-6 levels were determined. . RESULTS: Clinical characteristics analysis of 48 cases of COVID-19 showed that RNAaemia was diagnosed only in the critically ill group and seemed to reflect the severity of the disease. Furthermore, the level of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in critically ill patients increased significantly, almost 10 times that in other patients. More importantly, the extremely high IL-6 level was closely correlated with the detection of RNAaemia (R = 0.902). CONCLUSIONS: Detectable serum SARS-Cov-2 RNA(RNAaemia) in COVID-19 patients was associated with elevated IL-6 concentration and poor prognosis. Because the elevated IL-6 may be part of a larger cytokine storm which could worsen outcome, IL-6 could be a potential therapeutic target for critically ill patients with an excessive inflammatory response.","Chen, Xiaohua; Zhao, Binghong; Qu, Yueming; Chen, Yurou; Xiong, Jie; Feng, Yong; Men, Dong; Huang, Qianchuan; Liu, Ying; Yang, Bo; Ding, Jinya; Li, Feng",Clin. infect. dis,382,1

This classification is usually considered when developing guidelines on the testing. It can be expanded to include classes 3 and 4 if possible. Also, it is suggested that the test be expanded to include all cases that have been tested at least once. This classification helps avoid over-reliance on limited testing and expensive procedures. Unfortunately, it shows that the number of infections is higher in classes 3 and 4 than in classes 1 and 2. This concept is not yet clear enough for most countries or regions that regularly report their confirmed cases. It is also not yet clear how this will affect the results of the tests in each class. If the number of confirmed cases in Region A is only 252, then Region B has 276 cases. But, since there are more details related to the disease classifications, this can be concluded that Region B has more infections than Region A, and although Region A has fewer confirmed cases, it has performed better than Region B in terms of tests performed. This means that they have fewer cases than Region B. Different countries may have different guidelines when it comes to resource adequacy. For instance, developed countries may offer PCR testing for most of their population, while underdeveloped nations may only offer suspected cases. For those with serious financial or human resource constraints, the prioritisation of testing should be considered a reasonable solution. It is highly recommended that all regions and countries report the confirmed cases of COVID-19 and this indicator can be enhanced by adding in the ratio of all confirmed cases to all tests.","Ferdosi, M.; Mostafavi, E.",Iranian Journal of Microbiology,382,27

RESULTS: For the nasopharyngeal swab samples, the results obtained using the 6-plex RT-ddPCR and RT-qPCR assays were all concordant. The 6-plex RT-ddPCR assay was more sensitive than RT-qPCR (85% versus 62%) on saliva samples from patients with positive nasopharyngeal swabs.

In this meta-analysis, we searched the literature from PubMed, Embase, through bioRxiv, and medRxiv until April 26, 2020. Studies reporting chronic kidney diseases (CKDs) and/or acute kidney injury (AKI) were included. Demographics, relevant data of disease severity, and patient's prognosis were extracted and aggregated. Twenty-one thousand one hundred sixty-four patients from 52 peer-reviewed studies were included. Thirty-seven studies (n = 16,922) reported CKD in COVID-19 patients at diagnosis, and the pooled prevalence was 3.52% (95% CI, 1.98-5.48%; I 2 = 93%). Subgroup analysis showed that CKD prevalence was higher in severe cases [odds ratio (OR), 3.42; 95% CI 2.05-5.61; I 2 = 0%] compared to those with non-severe disease and deceased cases (6.46, 3.40-12.29; I 2 = 1%) compared with survivors.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The placenta tissues were evaluated by using immunohistochemistry for inflammatory cells and Hofbauer cells, and using severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV-2 RNA Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization (FISH) and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein immunofluorescence (IF) double staining. All eight placentas from the third trimester pregnancy women were studied. All patients were cured, no clinical or serological evidence pointed to vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Features of maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM) such as increased syncytial knots were present in all 8 cases (8/8), and increased focal perivillous fibrin depositions were presented in 7 cases (7/8). No significate chronic histiocytic intervillositis was noted in the placenta. The number of macrophages and inflammatory cells such as T cells, B cells and plasma cells in the placental villous was not significantly increased in all cases. Moreover, all of eight cases demonstrated negative results by FISH using a SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA probe and by IF using a monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of vertical transmission and adverse maternal-fetal outcomes in the placentas of third trimester COVID-19 pregnancy women, which provided further information for the clinical management of those women in the third trimester.

The present study aims to investigate the perceived psychosocial health and its sociodemographic correlates among Chinese community-dwelling residents. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was carried out online and using a structured questionnaire during April 2020. In total, 4788 men and women with the age range of 11-98 years from eight provinces in eastern, central and western China were included in the analysis. We adopted a tactical approach to capture three key domains of perceived psychosocial health that are more likely to occur during a pandemic including hopelessness, loneliness, and depression. Multiple regression method, binary logistic regression model and variance inflation factor (VIF) were used to conduct data analysis. RESULTS: Respectively 34.8%, 32.5% and 44.8% of the participants expressed feeling more hopeless, lonely, and depressed during the pandemic. The percentage of all three indicators was comparatively higher among women than among men: hopelessness (50.7% vs 49.3%), loneliness (52.4% vs 47.6%), and depression (56.2% vs 43.8%). Being married was associated with lower odds of loneliness among men (odds ratio [OR] = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.45-0.90). Loneliness was negatively associated with smoking (OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.45-0.99) and positively associated with drinking (OR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.04-2.02). Compared with those in the lowest income bracket (< CNY 10 000), men (OR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.21-0.55) and women (OR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.23-0.56) in the highest level of annually housed income (> CNY 40 000) had the lowest odds of reporting perceived hopelessness (OR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.25-0.48). Smoking also showed negative association with depression only among men (OR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.43-0.91). CONCLUSIONS: More than one-third of the participants reported worsening in the experience of hopelessness and loneliness, with more than two-fifth of worsening depression during the pandemic compared with before the outbreak. Several socioeconomic and lifestyle factors were found to be associated with the outcome variables, most notably participants' marital status, household income, smoking, alcohol drinking, existing chronic conditions. These findings may be of significance to treat patients and help them recover from the pandemic.","Wang, Gan-Yi; Tang, Shang-Feng",Infect Dis Poverty,382,1

We aimed to delineate and compare the immunological features of severe and moderate COVID-19.METHODSIn this retrospective study, the clinical and immunological characteristics of 21 patients (17 male and 4 female) with COVID-19 were analyzed. These patients were classified as severe (11 cases) and moderate (10 cases) according to the guidelines released by the National Health Commission of China.RESULTSThe median age of severe and moderate cases was 61.0 and 52.0 years, respectively. Common clinical manifestations included fever, cough, and fatigue. Compared with moderate cases, severe cases more frequently had dyspnea, lymphopenia, and hypoalbuminemia, with higher levels of alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and D-dimer as well as markedly higher levels of IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-&#945;. Absolute numbers of T lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells decreased in nearly all the patients, and were markedly lower in severe cases (294.0, 177.5, and 89.0 × 106/L, respectively) than moderate cases (640.5, 381.5, and 254.0 × 106/L, respectively). The expression of IFN-Î³ by CD4+ T cells tended to be lower in severe cases (14.1%) than in moderate cases (22.8%).CONCLUSIONThe SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes, particularly CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, resulting in a decrease in numbers as well as IFN-Î³ production by CD4+ T cells. These potential immunological markers may be of importance because of their correlation with disease severity in COVID-19.TRIAL REGISTRATIONThis is a retrospective observational study without a trial registration number.FUNDINGThis work is funded by grants from Tongji Hospital for the Pilot Scheme Project, and partly supported by the Chinese National Thirteenth Five Years Project in Science and Technology for Infectious Disease (2017ZX10202201).","Chen, Guang; Wu, Di; Guo, Wei; Cao, Yong; Huang, Da; Wang, Hongwu; Wang, Tao; Zhang, Xiaoyun; Chen, Huilong; Yu, Haijing; Zhang, Xiaoping; Zhang, Minxia; Wu, Shiji; Song, Jianxin; Chen, Tao; Han, Meifang; Li, Shusheng; Luo, Xiaoping; Zhao, Jianping; Ning, Qin",J Clin Invest,382,22

However, very few studies were conducted to analyze the general public's perception of what causes stress, anxiety, and trauma during COVID-19. This study focuses particularly on understanding Indian citizens. METHODS: By using Machine learning techniques, particularly Natural language processing, this study focuses on understanding the attitude of Indian citizens while discussing the anxiety, stress, and trauma created because of COVID-19 and the major reasons that cause it. We used Tweets as data for this study. We have used 840,000 tweets for this study. RESULTS: Our sentiment analysis study revealed the interesting fact that, even while discussing about the stress, anxiety, and trauma caused by COVID-19, most of the tweets were in neutral sentiments. Death and Lockdown caused by the COVID-19 were the two most important aspects that cause stress, anxiety, and Trauma among Indian citizens. CONCLUSION: It is important for policymakers and health professionals to understand common citizen's perspectives of what causes them stress, anxiety, and trauma to formulate policies and treat the patients. Our study shows that Indian citizens use social media to share their opinions about COVID-19 and as a coping mechanism in unprecedented time.","Praveen, S V; Ittamalla, Rajesh; Deepak, Gerard",Diabetes Metab Syndr,382,16

We present both near-term and long-term policy solutions. Seven near-term policy recommendations include requiring the uniform public reporting of COVID-19 cases in all LTSS settings; identifying and supporting unpaid caregivers; bolstering protections for the direct care workforce; increasing coordination between public health departments and LTSS agencies and providers; enhancing collaboration and communication across health, LTSS, and public health systems; further reducing barriers to telehealth in LTSS; and providing incentives to care for vulnerable populations. Long-term reform should focus on comprehensive workforce development, comprehensive LTSS financing reform, and the creation of an age-friendly public health system. CONTEXT: The heavy toll of COVID-19 brings the failings of the long-term services and supports (LTSS) system in the United States into sharp focus. Although these are not new problems, the pandemic has exacerbated and amplified their impact to a point that they are impossible to ignore. The primary blame for the high rates of COVID-19 infections and deaths has been assigned to formal LTSS care settings, specifically nursing homes. Yet other systemic problems have been unearthed during this pandemic: the failure to coordinate the US public health system at the federal level and the effects of long-term disinvestment and neglect of state- and local-level public health programs. Together these failures have contributed to an inability to coordinate with the LTSS system and to act early to protect residents and staff in the LTSS care settings that are hotspots for infection, spread, and serious negative health outcomes. METHODS: We analyze several impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the US LTSS system and policy arrangements. The economic toll on state budgets has been multifaceted, and the pandemic has had a direct impact on Medicaid, the primary funder of LTSS, which in turn has further exacerbated the states' fiscal problems. Both the inequalities across race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status as well as the increased burden on unpaid caregivers are clear. So too is the need to better integrate LTSS with the health, social care, and public health systems. FINDINGS: We propose seven near-term actions that US policymakers could take: implementing a uniform public reporting of COVID-19 cases in LTSS settings; identifying and supporting unpaid caregivers; bolstering support for the direct care workforce; increasing coordination between public health departments and LTSS agencies and providers; enhancing collaboration and communication across health, LTSS, and public health systems; further reducing the barriers to telehealth in LTSS; and providing incentives to care for our most vulnerable populations. Our analysis also demonstrates that our nation requires comprehensive reform to build the LTSS system we need through comprehensive workforce development, universal coverage through comprehensive financing reform, and the creation of an age-friendly public health system. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has exposed the many deficits of the US LTSS system and made clear the interdependence of LTSS with public health. Policymakers have an opportunity to address these failings through a substantive reform of the LTSS system and increased collaboration with public health agencies and leaders. The opportunity for reform is now.","Dawson, Walter D; Boucher, Nathan A; Stone, Robyn; VAN Houtven, Courtney H",Milbank q,382,30

Public health strategy to address emerging infectious diseases has depended in part on human behavior change and yet the perceptions and knowledge motivating that behavior have been at times inconsistent with the latest consensus of peer-reviewed science. Part of that disjuncture likely involves the existence and persistence of past ideas about other diseases. To forecast and prepare for future epidemic and pandemic response, we need to better understand how people approach emerging infectious diseases as objects of public opinion during the periods when such diseases first become salient at a population level. In this essay, we explore two examples of how existing mental models of past infectious diseases appear to have conditioned and constrained public response to novel viral diseases. We review previously reported experiences related to Zika virus in Central America and discuss public opinion data collected in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the case of Zika virus disease, we assess how thinking about earlier mosquito-borne disease seems to have affected public consideration of the virus in Guatemala. In the case of COVID-19, we assess how previous vaccination behavior for a different disease is associated with intention to obtain vaccination for COVID-19 in the future.","Southwell, Brian G; Kelly, Bridget J; Bann, Carla M; Squiers, Linda B; Ray, Sarah E; McCormack, Lauren A",Health Commun,382,21

Treatment of hyper-inflammation in these patients using existing, approved therapies with proven safety profiles could address the immediate need to reduce mortality. RESULTS: We analyzed the changes in the gene expression, pathways and putative mechanisms induced by SARS-CoV2 in NHBE, and A549 cells, as well as COVID-19 lung vs. their respective controls. We used these changes to identify FDA approved drugs that could be repurposed to help COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms related to hyper-inflammation. We identified methylprednisolone (MP) as a potential leading therapy. The results were then confirmed in five independent validation data sets including Vero E6 cells, lung and intestinal organoids, as well as additional patient lung sample vs. their respective controls. Finally, the efficacy of MP was validated in an independent clinical study. Thirty-day all-cause mortality occurred at a significantly lower rate in the MP-treated group compared to control group (29.6% vs. 16.6%, p = 0.027). Clinical results confirmed the in silico prediction that MP could improve outcomes in severe cases of COVID-19. A low number needed to treat (NNT = 5) suggests MP may be more efficacious than dexamethasone or hydrocortisone. AVAILABILITY: iPathwayGuide is available at https://ipathwayguide.advaitabio.com/.

METHODS: A total of 1260 participants completed the Self-Rating Scale of Sleep (SRSS), the Generalized Anxiety Scale (GAD-7), and the 9-item patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) via the online questionnaires, and their related experiences with COVID-19 were collected. RESULTS: The average SRSS score of all participants (25.13 ± 6.41) indicated a mild sleep problem, and the factors that influenced their sleep were the respondent's gender, whether they had patients who died under their care, their history of psychosis and whether their family members were infected with COVID-19. The average GAD-7 score of all participants (12.37 ± 4.89) indicated a moderate anxiety level. The main factors that influenced anxiety were the respondent's gender, years of work, history of psychosis, self-perceived health status, and whether their family members were infected with COVID-19. The average PHQ-9 score of all participants (8.90 ± 5.42) indicated a mild depression level. The primary factors that influenced depression were whether the respondent had nursed/treated severely ill patients in Hubei and whether they had a history of psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: During the outbreak of COVID-19, the symptoms of anxiety were prominent among healthcare workers in Hubei. Moreover, male workers, those whose patients died during treatment, those with a history of anxiety disorders and those whose family members were infected with COVID-19 reported more serious problems. Therefore, this particular group of healthcare workers needs to be monitored and provided with tailored psychological support.","Zhou, Peng; Du, Na; Diao, Dongmei; OuYang, Yingjie; Kankanam Pathiranage, Heshan Sameera",Ann.

It is known to work as the major antioxidant in plants, and it underpins several environmentally induced stresses due to its use as a co-factor by certain 2-oxoglutarate-dependent (2-OG) dioxygenases [2(OG)-dioxygenases]. It is important to understand the role of 2(OG)-dioxygenases in the biosynthesis of ascorbate. The present study examined contents of ascorbate and protein-protein interaction in nine T-DNA mutants of Arabidopsis containing an insert in their respective (2-OG) dioxygenase genes (At1g20270, At1g68080, At2g17720, At3g06290, At3g28490, At4g35810, At4g35820, At5g18900, At5g66060). In this study, the amount of ascorbate in five of the mutants was shown to be almost two-fold or more than two-fold higher than in the wild type. This result may be a consequence of the insertion of the T-DNA. The prediction of possible protein interactions between 2(OG)-dioxygenases and relevant ascorbate-function players may indicate the oxidative effects of certain dioxygenase proteins in plants. It is expected that certain dioxygenases are actively involved in the metabolic and biosynthetic pathways of ascorbate. This involvement may be of importance to increase ascorbate amounts in plants for human nutrition, and to protect plant species against stress conditions.","Mahmood, Asaad M; Dunwell, Jim M",PLoS One,382,16

We reviewed the National Cancer Database for men with Gleason Grade Group 2 or higher prostate cancer treated with RP and had pathologically node-negative disease. LNY was modeled as a continuous and categorical variable grouped by quartiles of LNY. Secondary treatment was defined as the use of radiation or systemic therapy post-RP. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression models were used to test for an association of LNY with OS and secondary treatments, respectively. We identified 89,416 men with pN0 prostate cancer treated with RP from 2010-2015. LNY was associated with improved OS when modeled as a categorical and continuous variable. The third (6-9 nodes) and fourth (&#8805;10 nodes) quartiles of LNY were associated with improved OS (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79-0.96, Pâ¯=â¯0.006 and HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79-0.98, P= 0.017, respectively) when compared with the lowest quartile of LNY (&#8804;3 nodes) and the hazard of death decreased by 1% for each benign lymph node removed (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98-0.99, P= 0.022). Additionally, categorical and continuous LNY was associated with significantly less use of post-RP secondary treatments. Removal of additional negative lymph nodes was associated with improved OS and less secondary treatments in patients with pN0 prostate cancer.

Objective: we aimed to assess STD in healthcare professionals (HCP), mainly allergists, affected with COVID-19, by means of a survey, and to evaluate the association of STD and their severity with demographic characteristics, symptoms, comorbidities, and hospital admission. METHODS: A 15-item questionnaire was designed including different sections as follows: demographics, diagnostic characteristics, STD patterns, medication use as well as comorbidities. The questionnaire was developed using Google forms, implemented and distributed to members of the Spanish Society of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (SEAIC) and spread via Social Media to be completed by HCP affected with COVID-19. RESULTS: HCP (n=234), 76.5% &#8804;55 yrs, 73.5% female, completed the survey. There was STD in up to 74.4% of the respondents, 95.6% reporting a moderate-severe impairment. Mean recovery time of taste dysfunction was 21.6±24.0 days in HCP &#8804;55 yrs and 33.61±26.2 days in >55 yrs (p=0.019). Stratified analysis by severity of STD showed that more than a half of COVID-19 subjects presented severe loss of smell. An older age (>55 yrs) was associated with fever, anorexia, less headache and with a longer persistence of taste dysfunction.

Surgical training has also been significantly affected by this pandemic, but the exact effect remains unknown. We sought to perform a national survey of general surgery residents in the United States to assess the effect of COVID-19 on surgical resident training, education, and burnout. METHODS: An anonymous online survey was created and distributed to general surgery residents across the United States. The survey aimed to assess changes to surgical residents' clinical schedules, operative volume, and educational curricula as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we sought to assess the impact of COVID-19 on resident burnout. RESULTS: One thousand one hundred and two general surgery residents completed the survey. Residents reported a significant decline in the number of cases performed during the pandemic. Educational curricula were largely shifted toward online didactics. The majority of residents reported spending more time on educational didactics than before the pandemic. The majority of residents feared contracting COVID-19 or transmitting it to their family during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has had significant impact on surgical training and education. One positive consequence of the pandemic is increased educational didactics. Online didactics should continue to be a part of surgical education in the post-COVID-19 era. Steps need to be taken to ensure that graduating surgical residents are adequately prepared for fellowship and independent practice despite the significantly decreased case volumes during this pandemic. Surgery training programs should focus on providing nontechnical clinical training and professional development during this time.","Aziz, Hassan; James, Tayler; Remulla, Daphne; Sher, Linda; Genyk, Yuri; Sullivan, Maura E; Sheikh, Mohd Raashid",J. surg. educ,382,12

It is unknown, however, how these levels compare with those observed in critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or sepsis due to other causes.METHODSWe used a Luminex assay to determine expression of 76 cytokines from plasma of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and banked plasma samples from ARDS and sepsis patients. Our analysis focused on detecting statistical differences in levels of 6 cytokines associated with cytokine storm (IL-1ß, IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, and TNF-&#945;) between patients with moderate COVID-19, severe COVID-19, and ARDS or sepsis.RESULTSFifteen hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 9 of whom were critically ill, were compared with critically ill patients with ARDS (n = 12) or sepsis (n = 16). There were no statistically significant differences in baseline levels of IL-1ß, IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, and TNF-&#945; between patients with COVID-19 and critically ill controls with ARDS or sepsis.CONCLUSIONLevels of inflammatory cytokines were not higher in severe COVID-19 patients than in moderate COVID-19 or critically ill patients with ARDS or sepsis in this small cohort. Broad use of immunosuppressive therapies in ARDS has failed in numerous Phase 3 studies; use of these therapies in unselected patients with COVID-19 may be unwarranted.FUNDINGFunding was received from NHLBI K23 HL125663 (AJR); The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation OPP1113682 (AJR and CAB); Burroughs Wellcome Fund Investigators in the Pathogenesis of Infectious Diseases #1016687 NIH/NIAID U19AI057229-16; Stanford Maternal Child Health Research Institute; and Chan Zuckerberg Biohub (CAB).","Wilson, Jennifer G; Simpson, Laura J; Ferreira, Anne-Maud; Rustagi, Arjun; Roque, Jonasel; Asuni, Adijat; Ranganath, Thanmayi; Grant, Philip M; Subramanian, Aruna; Rosenberg-Hasson, Yael; Maecker, Holden T; Holmes, Susan P; Levitt, Joseph E; Blish, Catherine A; Rogers, Angela J",JCI insight,382,24

However, recent years have seen major pandemics caused by coronavirus which are very invasive and virulent in nature. The recent SARS-CoV2 is a new addition to this list of coronavirus pandemics. So the present study was done to systematically review the CNS involvement and its manifestations in SARS-CoV2 positive patients. Systemic review of article published between 1st Dec 2019 to 31st July 2020 searched through web-based database of MEDLINE (Pubmed) and Google scholar using following keywords ""COVID -19"" OR ""CORONAVIRUS"" OR ""SARS-CoV2"" AND ""NEUROLOGICAL"" OR ""CNS"" OR ""BRAIN"".

Majority of these article were reporting neurological symptoms among patients admitted in different wards along with others general symptoms. None of the study was specifically devoted to study the neurological manifestations and complications in SARS-CoV2 positive patients. The present study concludes that there is a scarcity of good quality research which attempts to establish the role of SARS-CoV2 infection in CNS and its manifestations. However, there are evidences that CNS involvement is present in majority of the patients.

The Americas and Europe are by far the WHO regions with the most introductions, 85% and 77% of their countries having already introduced respectively. A record number of introductions was observed in 2019, most of which in low- and middle- income countries (LMIC) where access has been limited. Programs had an average performance coverage of around 67% for the first dose and 53% for the final dose of HPV. LMICs performed on average better than high- income countries for the first dose, but worse for the last dose due to higher dropout. Only 5 (6%) countries achieved coverages with the final dose of more than 90%, 22 countries (21%) achieved coverages of 75% or higher while 35 (40%) had a final dose coverage of 50% or less.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A non-systematic review of the literature regarding the management of penile cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic was performed until April 30, 2020. We propose our recommendations based on this evidence. RESULTS: Penile cancer is an uncommon but aggressive disease. Prognosis is determined by several characteristics, being the most important the presence of lymph nodes, in which case, treatment should not be delayed. For these reasons, an initial evaluation is mandatory. Priority classifications, based on the oncological outcomes when treatment is delayed, have been made in order to separate deferrable disease from the one that needs high priority treatment. In penile cancer with low risk of progression, surgical treatment can be delayed, but other options must be considered, like topical treatment or laser therapy. In cases with intermediate risk of progression, surgical treatment may be delayed up to three months, but we must consider radiation therapy and brachytherapy as effective options. When feasible, follow-up should by telemonitoring. CONCLUSIONS: In the COVID-19 era, initial evaluation of the patient is mandatory. Histological diagnosis with local staging is necessary before offering any therapeutic option. In case of superficial non-invasive disease, topical treatment is effective in absence of lymph node involvement. In selected patients, radiotherapy is an organ-preserving approach with good results. Non-deferrable surgical treatment must be performed by an experienced surgeon and as an outpatient procedure when possible. When indicated, iLND should not be delayed since it is decisive for patient survival. Follow-up should be by telemonitoring.","Casco, Nelson Canales; Carmona, María Jiménez; Soto, Álvaro Juárez",Int Braz J Urol,382,27

The first is a 59-year-old female with HT in 2012 who presented on March 20, 2020 with fever, hypoxia, and ground-glass opacities on chest X-ray. She quickly progressed to acute hypoxic respiratory failure and vasoplegic shock.

Given a milder presentation compared to the first patient, antimetabolite was discontinued and only hydroxychloroquine was started. Because of a lack of clinical improvement several days later, tocilizumab, methylprednisolone, and therapeutic anticoagulation were initiated. The patient clinically improved with decreasing oxygen requirements and was discharged home.

In this study, we compared the immunogenic properties of SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike (S) ectodomain in young adult and aged mice, S1 with receptor binding domain, and S2 with fusion domain. Full-length S was more immunogenic and effective in inducing IgG antibodies after low dose vaccination, compared to the S1 subunit.

With an increased vaccine dose, S1 was highly effective in inducing neutralizing and receptor-binding inhibiting antibodies, although both S1 and S2 subunit domain vaccines were similarly immunogenic. Adjuvant effects were significant for effective induction of IgG1 and IgG2a isotypes, neutralizing and receptor-binding inhibiting antibodies, and antibody-secreting B cell and interferon-Î³ secreting T cell immune responses.

The risks of staffing challenges and clinician exposure are of significant concern. One resource, telecritical care (TCC), has the potential to optimize efficiency, maximize safety, and improve quality of care provided amid large-scale disruptions, but its role in pandemic situations is only loosely defined. Planning and Preparation Phase: We propose strategic initiatives by which TCC may act as a force multiplier for pandemic preparedness in response to COVID-19, utilizing a tiered approach for increasing surge capacity needs. The goals involved usage of TCC to augment ICU capacity, optimize safety, minimize personal protective equipment (PPE) use, improve efficiencies, and enhance knowledge of managing pandemic response. Implementation Phase: A phased approach utilizing TCC would involve implementing remote capabilities across the enterprise to accomplish the goals outlined. The hardware and software needed for initial expansion to cover 275 beds included $956,670 for mobile carts and $173,106 for home workstations. Team role deployment and bedside clinical care centering around TCC as critical care capacity expand beyond 275 beds. Surge capacity was not reached during early phases of the pandemic in the region, allowing refinement of TCC during subsequent pandemic phases. Conclusions: Leveraging TCC facilitated pandemic surge planning but required redefinition of typical ICU staffing models. The design was meant to workforce efficiencies, reduce PPE use, and minimize health care worker exposure risk, all while maintaining quality care standards through an intensivist-led model. As health care operations resumed and states reopened, TCC is being used to support shifts in volume and critical care personnel during the pandemic evolution. The lessons applied may help health care systems through variable phases of the pandemic.","Singh, Jaspal; Green, Michael B; Lindblom, Scott; Reif, Michael S; Thakkar, Nehal P; Papali, Alfred",Telemed. j. e. health,382,25

Possible irritant effects of ABHR may prevent their use by persons at risk of infection. METHODS: This systematic review is based on a PubMed search of articles published between January 2000 and September 2019 in English and German, and a manual search, related to the irritation potential of alcohol-based disinfectants restricted to n-propanol (1-propanol) and its structural isomer isopropanol (isopropyl alcohol, 2-propanol). RESULTS: The majority of the included studies show a low irritation potential of n-propanol alone. However, recent studies provide evidence for significant barrier damage effects of repeated exposure to 60% n-propanol in healthy, as well as atopic skin in vivo. The synergistic response of combined irritants, (ie, a combination of n-propanol or isopropanol with detergents such as sodium lauryl sulfate) is greater, compared with a quantitatively identical application of the same irritant alone. CONCLUSION: While recent studies indicate a higher risk of skin irritation for n-propanol and isopropanol than reported in the past, this risk still seems to be lower than that for frequent handwashing with detergents, as recommended by some to prevent COVID-19 infections.","Tasar, Ramona; Wiegand, Cornelia; Elsner, Peter",Contact Dermatitis,382,26

METHODS: The gene set enrichment profile, GSE12446, which includes 9 human endometrial samples from postmenopausal women treated with tibolone (tibolone group) and 9 control samples (control group), was downloaded from GEO database for analysis. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in tibolone vs. control groups were identified and then used for function and pathway enrichment analysis. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and module analyses were also performed. Finally, drug-target interaction was predicted for genes in modules, and then were validated in Pubmed. RESULTS: A total of 238 up-regulated DEGs and 72 down-regulated DEGs were identified. These DEGs were mainly enriched in various biological processed and pathways, such as cilium movement (e.g., CCDC114 and DNAI2), calcium ion homeostasis, regulation of hormone levels and complement/coagulation cascades. PPI network contained 368 interactions and 166 genes, of which IGF1, DNALI1, CCDC114, TOP2A, DNAH5 and DNAI2 were the hue genes. A total of 96 drug-gene interactions were obtained, including 94 drugs and eight genes. TOP2A and HTR2B were found to be targets of 28 drugs and 38 drugs, respectively. Among the 94 obtained drugs, only 12 drugs were reported in studies, of which 7 drugs (e.g., epirubicin) were found to target TOP2A. CONCLUSIONS: CCDC114 and DNAI2 might play important roles in tibolone-treated postmenopausal women via cilium movement function. TOP2A might be a crucial target of tibolone in endometrium of postmenopausal women.","Lv, Yanhua; Liu, Yanqing; Wang, Yueqiang; Kong, Fanrong; Pang, Qiuxiang; Hu, Guirong",BMC Womens Health,382,1

Leucocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2) has been reported as a regulatory factor in some chronic diseases such as hepatitis through mediating downstream target gene ß-catenin. Additionally, Wnt/ß-catenin is also the crucial modulatory signal pathway in OD. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) is a kind of mesodermal stem cells; its differentiation direction is discovered affected by Wnt/ß-catenin. However, the function of LECT2 in osteoporosis still remains exploration, which encourages us to lucubrate its functional effect in regulating the OD of MSCs. In this study, we found that LECT2 was expressed at low level in MSCs with osteogenic differentiation, and knockdown of LECT2 would activate Wnt/ß-catenin pathway and therefore promoting OD in MSCs. It is the first time to report that LECT2 participates in regulating OD via mediating Wnt/ß-catenin. Our discovery would affirmatively help provide a novel strategy for the diagnosis and therapy methods for osteoporosis.","Xu, Zhonghua; He, Jin; Zhou, Xindie; Zhang, Yi; Huang, Yong; Xu, Nanwei; Yang, Haoyu",Biomed Pharmacother,382,1

The aim of this statement is to outline the profiles of the medical legal liability, with a focus on the figure of the vaccinating physician, in criminal, civil, and disciplinary terms, based on the Italian legislation in force. The vaccinating doctor responds for his work in the field of vaccination in the same way as any other health service should perform (diagnostic, therapeutic, etc.). Helpful in this context is the adoption of the L. 76/2021;it was developed to find a balance between safeguarding the person privacy and greater guarantees for the doctor. This law introduces a criminal shield that can put a limit to litigation, curbing the phenomenon of so-called defensive medicine. The climate of uncertainty and fear of legal repercussions for the doctors, and the constant updating and redefinition of the indications of operability in the vaccination campaigns, underline the need to focus on the knowledge of the responsibilities and the safeguard of the vaccinating doctors.

The drop in the percentage of active individuals with or without medication occurred when comparing the scenarios before and during quarantine. However, the difference in the prevalence of active individuals between the groups was significant, showing that the group with medication remained more active. The fear of contamination, the measures of distance and the lack of adherence of the population to classes by videoconference reduced the frequency of physical activities in the general sample population. However, people who used medication showed greater concern about the practice of physical activity to optimize treatment.

However, the emergence of several variants of concern and reports of declining antibody levels have raised uncertainty about the durability of immune memory following vaccination. In this study, we longitudinally profiled both antibody and cellular immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 naive and recovered individuals from pre-vaccine baseline to 6 months post-mRNA vaccination. Antibody and neutralizing titers decayed from peak levels but remained detectable in all subjects at 6 months post-vaccination. Functional memory B cell responses, including those specific for the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Delta (B.1.617.2) variants, were also efficiently generated by mRNA vaccination and continued to increase in frequency between 3 and 6 months post-vaccination. Notably, most memory B cells induced by mRNA vaccines were capable of cross-binding variants of concern, and B cell receptor sequencing revealed significantly more hypermutation in these RBD variant-binding clones compared to clones that exclusively bound wild-type RBD. Moreover, the percent of variant cross-binding memory B cells was higher in vaccinees than individuals who recovered from mild COVID-19. mRNA vaccination also generated antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and durable memory CD4+ T cells in most individuals, with early CD4+ T cell responses correlating with humoral immunity at later timepoints. These findings demonstrate robust, multi-component humoral and cellular immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 and current variants of concern for at least 6 months after mRNA vaccination. Finally, we observed that boosting of pre-existing immunity with mRNA vaccination in SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals primarily increased antibody responses in the short-term without significantly altering antibody decay rates or long-term B and T cell memory. Together, this study provides insights into the generation and evolution of vaccine-induced immunity to SARS-CoV-2, including variants of concern, and has implications for future booster strategies.

In this study, 66 epitopes containing pentapeptides of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the IEDB database were compared with the amino acid sequence of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and 66 potentially immune-related peptides of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were obtained. Based on the SNPs analysis of spike protein of 1218 SARS-CoV-2 isolates, 52 easily mutated sites were identified and used for vaccine epitope screening. The best vaccine candidate epitopes in the 66 peptides of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were screened out through mutation and immunoinformatics analysis. The best candidate epitopes were connected by different linkers in silico to obtain vaccine candidate sequences. The results showed that 16 epitopes were relatively conservative, immunological, non-toxic and non-allergenic, could induce the secretion of cytokines and more likely to be exposed on the surface of spike protein. They were both B cell epitopes and T cell epitopes, which could recognize a certain number of HLA molecules and had high coverage rates in different populations. Moreover, epitopes 897-913 were predicted possible cross-immunoprotection for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The results of vaccine candidate sequences screening suggested that sequences (without linker, with linker GGGSGGG, EAAAK, GPGPG and KK, respectively) were the best. The proteins translated by these sequences were relatively stable, with high antigenic index and good biological activity. Our study provided vaccine candidate epitopes and sequences for the research of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. This article is protected by copyright.

Curfews have been imposed on individuals aged 65 and older to reduce contact with other people. We aimed to determine anxiety and loneliness levels and associated factors of individuals aged 65 and over in-home quarantine. Method: We determined sociodemographic, clinical features, information status on COVID-19 pandemic, geriatric anxiety scale and loneliness scale for the elderly values of 290 individuals (65- 90 years old) in Turkey. Results: The mean age was 71.2+/-5.9 years, and 54.8% were male(n: 159). 87.6% followed COVID-19 process, and 88.3% received the information from the television. 14.1% reported significant worries about the individuals in their family, 14.1% about their social life, and 19.7% about their economic situation. A statistically significant relationship was observed between the geriatric anxiety and the loneliness scale(r: 0.498, p: 0.001). Anxiety scores were increased 1.29 fold by loneliness scores, 3.56 fold by having a chronic disease and 3.26 fold by the history of a psychiatric disorder. Discussion: We suggest that quarantine increases anxiety and loneliness levels in geriatric population with a positive correlation between anxiety and loneliness levels. Having a chronic disease and History of a psychiatric disorder was also associated with anxiety levels. The majority of concerns is about their family members, future social and economic lives. It has been observed that television has become an essential source of information in the pandemic for the geriatric population. Authorities should meet the psychosocioeconomic needs of elderly individuals, and correct information should be provided.

This situation may have an impact on mental health, tobacco smoking, and alcohol consumption. The aim of this research report is therefore to describe changes in tobacco and alcohol consumption in the general French population during the first two weeks of lockdown and identify any associated factors. METHODS: Self-reported changes in smoking and alcohol consumption following the lockdown implemented in France on March 17, 2020 were collected from 2,003 respondents aged 18 years and older in an online cross-sectional survey carried out from March 30 to April 1, 2020. Anxiety and depression levels were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS: Among current smokers, 26.7% reported an increase in their tobacco consumption since lockdown and 18.6% reported a decrease, while it remained stable for 54.7%. The increase in tobacco consumption was associated with an age of 18-34 years, a high level of education, and anxiety. Among alcohol drinkers, 10.7% reported an increase in their alcohol consumption since lockdown and 24.4% reported a decrease, while it remained stable for 64.8%. The increase in alcohol consumption was associated with an age of 18-49 years, living in cities of more than 100,000 inhabitants, a high socio-professional category, and a depressive mood. CONCLUSION: The national lockdown implemented in France during the COVID-19 pandemic influenced tobacco and alcohol consumption in different ways according to sociodemographic group and mental health.","Guignard, Romain; Andler, Raphaël; Quatremère, Guillemette; Pasquereau, Anne; du Roscoät, Enguerrand; Arwidson, Pierre; Berlin, Ivan; Nguyen-Thanh, Viêt",Eur. j. public health,382,1

These events were followed by 4 aftershocks of magnitude Mw ≤ 3.0. We carried out morphotectonic (high stream length-gradient index) and static Coulomb stress failure analyses to delineate the hidden causative fault(s) in the region. In the study, ASTER DEM data of 30 m resolution and Survey of India (SoI) toposheets on 1:50,000 scales were used for morphotectonic analysis. The analysis depicted a very high stream length-gradient (SL) and fall in elevation in the epicentral area, suggesting the area to be tectonically active with a NE-SW trending fault line. In addition, the nature of static Coulomb failure stress contours for both the main events, Mw 3.5 and Mw 3.4, suggests an NNE-SSW trending high Coulomb stress regime. Such a high coulomb stress regime is obvious at the location where a high SL index and fall in elevation were marked, which clearly indicates the presence of NNE-SSW trending a causative fault, named ‘Khanpur-Japti fault’.","Bansal, Brijesh K.; Mohan, Kapil Ul Haq Ahsan Verma Mithila Prajapati S.

We previously built fully glycosylated full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein models in a viral membrane including both open and closed conformations of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and different templates for the stalk region. In this work, multiple µs-long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were performed to provide deeper insights into the structure and dynamics of S protein and glycan functions. Our simulations reveal that the highly flexible stalk is composed of two independent joints and most probable S protein orientations are competent for ACE2 binding. We identify multiple glycans stabilizing the open and/or closed states of the RBD and demonstrate that the exposure of antibody epitopes can be captured by detailed antibody-glycan clash analysis instead of commonly used accessible surface area analysis that tends to overestimate the impact of glycan shielding and neglect possible detailed interactions between glycan and antibodies. Overall, our observations offer structural and dynamic insights into the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and potentialize for guiding the design of effective antiviral therapeutics.","Choi, Yeol Kyo; Cao, Yiwei; Frank, Martin; Woo, Hyeonuk; Park, Sang-Jun; Yeom, Min Sun; Croll, Tristan I; Seok, Chaok; Im, Wonpil",J Chem Theory Comput,382,16

Despite extensive research, there are still no specific drugs or vaccines to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hence, this study was designed to evaluate some plant-based active compounds for drug candidacy against SARS-CoV-2 by using virtual screening methods and various computational analyses. A total of 27 plant metabolites were screened against SARS-CoV-2 main protease proteins (MPP), Nsp9 RNA binding protein, spike receptor binding domain, spike ecto-domain and HR2 domain using a molecular docking approach. Four metabolites, i.e., asiatic acid, avicularin, guajaverin, and withaferin showed maximum binding affinity with all key proteins in terms of lowest global binding energy. The crucial binding sites and drug surface hotspots were unravelled for each viral protein. The top candidates were further employed for ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) analysis to investigate their drug profiles. Results suggest that none of the compounds render any undesirable consequences that could reduce their drug likeness properties. The analysis of toxicity pattern revealed no significant tumorigenic, mutagenic, irritating, or reproductive effects by the compounds. However, withaferin was comparatively toxic among the top four candidates with considerable cytotoxicity and immunotoxicity. Most of the target class by top drug candidates belonged to enzyme groups (e.g. oxidoreductases hydrolases, phosphatases). Moreover, results of drug similarity prediction revealed two approved structural analogs of Asiatic acid i.e. Hydrocortisone (DB00741) (previously used for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS) and Dinoprost-tromethamine (DB01160) from DrugBank. In addition, two other biologically active compounds, Mupirocin (DB00410) and Simvastatin (DB00641) could be an option for the treatment of viral infections. The study may pave the way to develop effective medications and preventive measure against SARS-CoV-2. Due to the encouraging results, we highly recommend further in vivo trials for the experimental validation of our findings.","Azim, Kazi Faizul; Ahmed, Sheikh Rashel; Banik, Anik; Khan, Md Mostafigur Rahman; Deb, Anamika; Somana, Saneya Risa",Inform.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the statistical associations between the statewise prevalence, mortality rate, and case fatality rate of COVID-19 in 24 regions in India (23 states and Delhi), as well as key demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related indices. METHODS: Data on disease prevalence, crude mortality, and case fatality were obtained from statistics provided by the Government of India for 24 regions, as of June 30, 2020. The relationship between these parameters and the demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related indices of the regions under study was examined using both bivariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: COVID-19 prevalence was negatively associated with male-to-female sex ratio (defined as the number of females per 1000 male population) and positively associated with the presence of an international airport in a particular state. The crude mortality rate for COVID-19 was negatively associated with sex ratio and the statewise burden of diarrheal disease, and positively associated with the statewise burden of ischemic heart disease. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that the COVID-19 crude mortality rate was significantly and negatively associated with sex ratio. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the transmission and impact of COVID-19 in a given population may be influenced by a number of variables, with demographic factors showing the most consistent association.","Rajkumar, Ravi Philip",JMIR Public Health Surveill,382,6

ARDS has been a major cause of death in the recent COVID-19 outbreak wherein asymptomatic respiratory tract infection progresses to ARDS from pneumonia have emphasized the need for a reliable therapy for the disease. The disease has a high mortality rate of approximately 30-50%. Despite the high mortality rate, a dearth of effective pharmacotherapy exists that demands extensive research in this area. The complex ARDS pathophysiology which remains to be understood completely and the multifactorial etiology of the disease has led to the poor diagnosis, impeded drug-delivery to the deeper pulmonary tissues, and delayed treatment of the ARDS patients. Besides, critically ill patients are unable to tolerate the off-target side effects. The vast domain of nanobiotechnology presents several drug delivery systems offering numerous benefits such as targeted delivery, prolonged drug release, and uniform drug-distribution. The present review presents a brief insight into the ARDS pathophysiology and summarizes conventional pharmacotherapies available to date.

We sought to describe trends in TCM visit delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of ambulatory electronic health records from December 30, 2019 and January 3, 2021. SETTING: United States. PARTICIPANTS: Forty four thousand six hundred and eighty-one patients receiving transitional care management services. MEASUREMENTS: Weekly rates of in-person and telehealth TCM visits before COVID-19 was declared a national emergency (December 30, 2019 to March 15, 2020), during the initial pandemic period (March 16, 2020 to April 12, 2020) and later period (April 12, 2020 to January 3, 2021). Characteristics of patients receiving in-person and telehealth TCM visits were compared. RESULTS: A total of 44,681 TCM visits occurred during the study period with the majority of patients receiving TCM visits age 65 years and older (68.0%) and female (55.0%) Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly all TCM visits were conducted in-person. In the initial pandemic, there was an immediate decline in overall TCM visits and a rise in telehealth TCM visits, accounting for 15.4% of TCM visits during this period. In the later pandemic, the average weekly number of TCM visits was 841 and 14.0% were telehealth. During the initial and later pandemic periods, 73.3% and 33.6% of COVID-19-related TCM visits were conducted by telehealth, respectively. Across periods, patterns of telehealth use for TCM visits were similar for younger and older adults. CONCLUSION: The study findings highlight a novel and sustained shift to providing TCM services via telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may reduce barriers to accessing a high-value service for older adults during a vulnerable transition period. Further investigations comparing outcomes of in-person and telehealth TCM visits are needed to inform innovation in ambulatory post-discharge care.","Anderson, Timothy S; O039,; Donoghue, Ashley L; Dechen, Tenzin; Herzig, Shoshana J; Stevens, Jennifer P",J. am. geriatr. soc,382,24

Here we identify and characterize existing environmental gaps in soil taxa and ecosystem functioning data across soil macroecological studies and 17,186 sampling sites across the globe. These data gaps include important spatial, environmental, taxonomic, and functional gaps, and an almost complete absence of temporally explicit data. We also identify the limitations of soil macroecological studies to explore general patterns in soil biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, with only 0.3% of all sampling sites having both information about biodiversity and function, although with different taxonomic groups and functions at each site.

To assess delay or avoidance of urgent or emergency and routine medical care because of concerns about COVID-19, a web-based survey was administered by Qualtrics, LLC, during June 24-30, 2020, to a nationwide representative sample of U.S. adults aged &#8805;18 years. Overall, an estimated 40.9% of U.S. adults have avoided medical care during the pandemic because of concerns about COVID-19, including 12.0% who avoided urgent or emergency care and 31.5% who avoided routine care. The estimated prevalence of urgent or emergency care avoidance was significantly higher among the following groups: unpaid caregivers for adults* versus noncaregivers (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] = 2.9); persons with two or more selected underlying medical conditions versus those without those conditions (aPR = 1.9); persons with health insurance versus those without health insurance (aPR = 1.8); non-Hispanic Black (Black) adults (aPR = 1.6) and Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) adults (aPR = 1.5) versus non-Hispanic White (White) adults; young adults aged 18-24 years versus adults aged 25-44 years (aPR = 1.5); and persons with disabilities§ versus those without disabilities (aPR = 1.3).

The number of reported cases by 19th of August in the Jazan region was more than 300, which exceeded the number of reported cases in larger regions such as Riyadh, and Makkah. This study aims to measure compliance by the public with COVID-19 preventive measures. Methods: This study was a cross-sectional, field-based observational assessment of compliance by individuals in public settings with COVID-19 preventive measures in the Jazan region of Saudi Arabia. The assessment was performed in the last week of July 2020. The assessment was based on observing the actual compliance of individuals and different establishments in the Jazan region with COVID-19 preventive measures. To perform the field observations, a standardised check-list was adopted from COVID-19 preventive measures in the community, which was developed by the Saudi Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC). Results: A total of 1,096 individuals were observed in 69 different locations in the Jazan region. Compliance by the observed individuals was variable depending on the age group, the setting and the recommended preventive practice. The findings indicate very low compliance of specific precautionary measures within public parks in comparison to other measured settings. Proportions of individuals not compliant with mask-wearing instructions varied according to settings and age group from 5% in malls and shopping areas to nearly 83% in public parks. Additionally, Proportions of children not compliant with mask-wearing instructions was higher in comparison to adults in all observed settings. Conclusions: The findings of this study identified variability in the levels of compliance with specific preventive measures against COVID-19. Further assessment is needed to explore factors associated with the limited observed compliance, in particular with regard to limited compliance to precautionary measures applied in specific settings and compliance of children to mask-wearing instructions.","Gosadi, Ibrahim M; Daghriri, Khaled A; Shugairi, Ahmad A; Alharbi, Ali H; Suwaydi, Abdullatif Z; Alharbi, Mohammed A; Majrashi, Ali A; Sumaily, Ibraheim A",,382,25

Up to now, however, the efficacy of school closure to reduce the spread of the disease in the community still remain unclear and no much is known about the potential negative effects of such measures on physical health and psychological wellbeing of children and adolescents, mainly if protracted for long periods. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the most relevant data of a systematic review on the impact of the 2020 school closure and social distances measures implemented in response to covid-19 pandemic on youths physical health and psychological wellbeing. In the present paper we describe the review's methodology and the characteristics and methodological quality of the retrieved studies. METHODS: We searched on 11 international databases up to 1st September 2020 to retrieve cohort studies, cross sectional surveys, uncontrolled pre-post studies and modelling studies. Methodological quality of included studies has been assessed with validated checklists. RESULTS: Sixty-four studies have been included; 42 assessed the effect of social distances measure of physical health and 27 on psychological wellbeing. All the studies have been conducted during the first wave of pandemic and assessed the short-term effect of social distances measures implemented for relatively short periods. The 32.4% of the studies has been conducted in the UK, 20.3% in Italy, 12.5% in China, 10.9% in developing countries and 9.4% in the US. 37.5% of the studies were cohort studies, 40.6% cross sectional surveys, 19.7% uncontrolled studies and 1 was a modeling study. 59.6% of the studies has been rated as high quality. The most important weakness of the cross-sectional surveys and uncontrolled studies was the scarce representativeness of the sample while 96% of the cohort studies were judged as high quality. CONCLUSIONS: A large number of acceptable quality studies have been published during the first months of pandemic to assess the impact of school closure and social distances measures on physical health and psychological wellbeing of youths. This highlights the relevance of the topic and the need to assess carefully the balance between harms and benefits of such measures in terms of actual reduction of transmission and youths' psychological and physical harms. Further studies are needed on the long-term effect of social distances measures extended over long periods.","Minozzi, Silvia; Saulle, Rosella; Amato, Laura; Davoli, Marina",Recenti Prog Med,382,16

Sleep index (0 [worst]-6 [best]) of each participant was retrieved from six sleep behaviors: snoring, chronotype, daytime sleepiness, sleep duration, insomnia, and difficulties in getting up. Two BAs, the KDM-biological age and PhenoAge, were estimated by corresponding algorithms based on clinical traits, and their discrepancies with chronological age were defined as the age accelerations (AAs). ResultsWe first observed negative associations between the sleep index and the two AAs, and demonstrated that the change of AAs could be the consequence of sleep quality using Mendelian randomization with genetic risk scores of sleep index and BAs. Particularly, one unit increase in sleep index was associated with 0.105- and 0.125-year decreases in KDM-biological age acceleration and PhenoAge acceleration, respectively. Furthermore, we observed significant independent and joint effects of sleep and air pollution (i.e. PM2.5 and NO2), another key driver of aging, on BAs. Sleep quality also showed modifying effect on the associations of elevated PM2.5 and NO2 levels with accelerated aging. For instance, an interquartile range increase in PM2.5 level was associated with 0.011-, 0.047-, and 0.078-year increase in PhenoAge acceleration among people with high (5-6), medium (3-4), and low (0-2) sleep index, respectively. ConclusionsOur findings elucidate that better sleep quality could lessen accelerated biological aging resulting from exogenous exposures including air pollution.

By analyzing metagenomic terabase datasets, we identified two compact families (775 to 803 amino acids (aa)) of CRISPR-Cas ribonucleases from hypersaline samples, named Cas13X and Cas13Y. We engineered Cas13X.1 (775 aa) for RNA interference experiments in mammalian cell lines. We found Cas13X.1 could tolerate single-nucleotide mismatches in RNA recognition, facilitating prophylactic RNA virus inhibition. Moreover, a minimal RNA base editor, composed of engineered deaminase (385 aa) and truncated Cas13X.1 (445 aa), exhibited robust editing efficiency and high specificity to induce RNA base conversions. Our results suggest that there exist untapped bacterial defense systems in natural microbes that can function efficiently in mammalian cells, and thus potentially are useful for RNA-editing-based research.","Xu, Chunlong; Zhou, Yingsi; Xiao, Qingquan; He, Bingbing; Geng, Guannan; Wang, Zikang; Cao, Birong; Dong, Xue; Bai, Weiya; Wang, Yifan; Wang, Xiang; Zhou, Dongming; Yuan, Tanglong; Huo, Xiaona; Lai, Jinsheng; Yang, Hui",Nat Methods,382,16

Even more debilitating than the infection itself, were the restrictions like lockdowns and quarantine measures taken to contain the spread of Coronavirus. Such enforced alienation affected both the mental and social condition of people significantly. Social interactions and congregations are not only integral part of work life but also formthe basis of human evolvement. However, COVID-19 brought all such communication to a grinding halt. Digital interactions have failed to enthuse the fervor that one enjoys in face-to-face meets. The pandemic has shoved the entire planet into an unstable state. The main focus and aim of the proposed study is to assess the impact of the pandemic on different aspects of the society in Saudi Arabia. To achieve this objective, the study analyzes two perspectives: The early approach, and the late approach of COVID-19 and the consequent effects on different aspects of the society. We used a Machine Learning based framework for the prediction of the impact of COVID-19 on the key aspects of society. Findings of this research study indicate that financial resources were the worst affected. Several countries are facing economic upheavals due to the pandemic and COVID-19 has had a considerable impact on the lives as well as the livelihoods of people.

The impact of the increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths in the country, and the increase in the number of cases and deaths outside the country may vary. To examine this, the study employs bootstrap ARDL cointegration approach from March 8, 2020 to May 24, 2020. According to the bootstrap ARDL results, a long-run equilibrium relationship is confirmed for five out of the 10 models. The long-term coefficients obtained from the ARDL models suggest that an increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths outside of the UK and the US has a significant effect on economic policy uncertainty. The US is more affected by the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. The UK, on the other hand, is more negatively affected by the increase in the number of COVID-19 deaths outside the country than the increase in the number of cases.

Despite major curricular changes within pharmacy training programs in recent years to facilitate a more hands-on role with patients, there has been negligible attention paid to training in exercise physiology and prescription. The goal was to therefore develop a course that would provide student pharmacists with the knowledge and skills to make evidence-based exercise recommendations to their patients, with a specific focus on chronic diseases and conditions that are commonly seen in community pharmacies. The 2-credit elective was designed to be taught by distance in order to accommodate students across two campuses and final year students undertaking clinical rotations across Washington. In hindsight, this decision was prescient given that its deployment was delayed until the fall of 2020 when all courses in Doctor of Pharmacy program at Washington State University were being delivered remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Fifteen self-contained modules were developed and delivered using the Blackboard learning management system and released to students on a weekly basis. Each module contained 3-5 learning objectives, an instructor-prepared video of no more than 15 minutes in duration that introduced and described the relevant material and provided practical examples relative to pharmacy practice, and links to resources that provided additional information on the respective topic. Students were then required to complete a quiz containing five open-book, multiple choice questions that directly addressed the stated learning objectives. Finally, 2-3 case studies, questions, tasks or articles that directly related to the weekly topic were posted by the instructor to a shared discussion board and students were required to review and analyze the materials and then share their thoughts and findings with their peers. The instructor held two voluntary one-hour Zoom meetings each week to allow students to discuss the module topic in a live online conversation with their peers and the instructor. N=33 students were registered in the course and all demonstrated attainment of knowledge and skills relevant to the defined learning outcomes and therefore received a passing grade. Formal feedback from the students was 100% positive in terms of the course structure, pace, assessment requirements and use of technology, in addition to the instructor's ability to stimulate interest, challenge students, respond to questions or problems, and integrate the course to the students? pharmacy training. Future plans include examining whether the course increased the frequency and improved the effectiveness of evidence-based exercise recommendations given by pharmacy graduates to their patients.","Marsh, Susan",The FASEB Journal,382,16

Emerging evidence shows that women may be more severely affected by this change. The pandemic, however, may have an impact beyond the immediate restructuring of employment and shift gender-role attitudes within households as a result of changes in the division of household labor. We analyze a representative sample of respondents in the U.S., Germany, and Singapore and show that transitions to unemployment, reductions in working hours and transitions to working from home have been more frequent for women than for men–although not to the same extent across the three countries. We also demonstrate that among couples who had been employed at the start of the pandemic, men express more egalitarian gender-role attitudes if they became unemployed but their partners remained employed, while women express more traditional attitudes if they became unemployed and their partners remained employed. These results indicate that gender-role attitudes might adapt to the lived realities. The long-term consequences will depend on how both men and women experience further shifts in their employment relations as economies recover.","Reichelt, Malte; Makovi, Kinga; Sargsyan, Anahit",Eur.

The varying transmission patterns, namely, nosocomial transmission and spread through mildly symptomatic cases is an area of concern. There is a spectrum of clinical features from mild to severe life threatening disease with major complications like severe pneumonia, ARDS, acute cardiac injury and septic shock. Presence of bilateral ground glass opacity and consolidation on imaging in appropriate clinical background should raise a suspicion about COVID 19. Poor prognostic factors include Multilobular infiltration on chest imaging, Lymphopenia, Bacterial co-infection, Smoking history, Chronic medical conditions like Hypertension and age >60 years (MuLBSTA score). Diagnosis is confirmed with PCR based testing of appropriate respiratory samples. Management is primarily supportive, with newer antivirals (lopinavir ritonavir and Remdesivir) under investigation.

Of the serial pharmacokinetic investigations we designed to facilitate identifying LianhuaQingwen compounds that are likely to be therapeutically important, the current investigation focused on the component Glycyrrhiza uralensis roots (Gancao). Besides its function in COVID-19 treatment, Gancao is able to induce pseudoaldosteronism by inhibiting renal 11ß-HSD2. Systemic and colon-luminal exposure to Gancao compounds were characterized in volunteers receiving LianhuaQingwen and by in vitro metabolism studies. Access of Gancao compounds to 11ß-HSD2 was characterized using human/rat, in vitro transport, and plasma protein binding studies, while 11ß-HSD2 inhibition was assessed using human kidney microsomes. LianhuaQingwen contained a total of 41 Gancao constituents (0.01-8.56 µmol/day). Although glycyrrhizin (1), licorice saponin G2 (2), and liquiritin/liquiritin apioside (21/22) were the major Gancao constituents in LianhuaQingwen, their poor intestinal absorption and access to colonic microbiota resulted in significant levels of their respective deglycosylated metabolites glycyrrhetic acid (8), 24-hydroxyglycyrrhetic acid (M2D; a new Gancao metabolite), and liquiritigenin (27) in human plasma and feces after dosing. These circulating metabolites were glucuronized/sulfated in the liver and then excreted into bile. Hepatic oxidation of 8 also yielded M2D.

It is necessary to conduct an initial screening of patients with the symptoms of COVID-19 disease to control the spread of the disease. However, it is becoming laborious to conduct the tests with the available testing kits due to the growing number of patients. Some studies proposed CT scan or chest X-ray images as an alternative solution. Therefore, it is essential to use every available resource, instead of either a CT scan or chest X-ray to conduct a large number of tests simultaneously. As a result, this study aims to develop a deep learning-based model that can detect COVID-19 patients with better accuracy both on CT scan and chest X-ray image dataset. In this work, eight different deep learning approaches such as VGG16, InceptionResNetV2, ResNet50, DenseNet201, VGG19, MobilenetV2, NasNetMobile, and ResNet15V2 have been tested on two dataset-one dataset includes 400 CT scan images, and another dataset includes 400 chest X-ray images studied. Besides, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) is used to explain the model's interpretability. Using LIME, test results demonstrate that it is conceivable to interpret top features that should have worked to build a trust AI framework to distinguish between patients with COVID-19 symptoms with other patients.","Ahsan, Md Manjurul; Gupta, Kishor Datta; Islam, Mohammad Maminur; Sen, Sajib; Rahman, Md.

Consequently, the positive effect on the environment has been witnessed. One of the most prominent evidences has been the drastic air quality improvement, as a direct consequence of lower emissions from reduced industrial activity. While several studies have demonstrated the validity of this hypothesis in mega-cities worldwide, it is still an unsubstantiated fact whether the same holds true for cities with a smaller urban extent and population. In the present study we investigate the temporal development of atmospheric constituent concentrations as retrieved concurrently from the Sentinel-5P satellite and a ground meteorological station. We focus on the period before and during the COVID-19 pandemic over the city of Hat Yai, Thailand and present the effect of the lockdown on the atmospheric quality over this average populated city (156,000 inhabitants). NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations decreased by 33.7%, 21.8% and 22.9% respectively in the first 3 weeks of the lockdown compared to the respective pre-lockdown period; O3 also decreased by 12.5% and contrary to similar studies. Monthly averages of NO2, CO and PM2.5 for the month April exhibit in 2020 the lowest values in the last decade. Sentinel-5P retrieved NO2 tropospheric concentrations, both locally over the ground station and the spatial average over the urban extent of the city, are in agreement with the reduction observed from the ground station. Numerous studies have already presented evidence of the bettering of the air quality over large metropolitan areas during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the current study we demonstrate that this holds true for Hat Yai, Thailand; we propound that the environmental benefits documented in major urban agglomerations during the lockdown may extend to medium-sized urban areas as well.","Stratoulias, Dimitris; Nuthammachot, Narissara",Sci Total Environ,382,30

Drought deteriorates rice productivity and induces various acclimation responses that aids in stress mitigation. However, the complexity of traits associated with drought tolerance has made the understanding of drought stress-induced responses in rice a challenging process. An integrative understanding based on physiological adaptations, omics, transgenic and molecular breeding approaches successively backed up to developing drought stress-tolerant rice.

This increase in infection-related strokes is marked by atypical presentations including stroke in younger patients and a high rate of hemorrhagic transformation after ischemia. A variety of pathogenic mechanisms may underlie this connection. Efforts to identify synergism in the pathophysiology underlying stroke and Sars-CoV-2 infection can inform the understanding of both conditions in novel ways. In this review, the molecular cascades connected to Sars-CoV-2 infection are placed in the context of the cerebral vasculature and in relationship to pathways known to be associated with stroke. Cytokine-mediated promotion of systemic hypercoagulability is suggested while direct Sars-CoV-2 infection of cerebral endothelial cells may also contribute. Endotheliopathy resulting from direct Sars-CoV-2 infection of the cerebral vasculature can modulate ACE2/AT1R/MasR signaling pathways, trigger direct viral activation of the complement cascade, and activate feed-forward cytokine cascades that impact the blood-brain barrier. All of these pathways are already implicated as independent mechanisms driving stroke and cerebrovascular injury irrespective of Sars-CoV-2. Recognizing the overlap of molecular pathways triggered by Sars-CoV-2 infection with those implicated in the pathogenesis of stroke provides an opportunity to identify future therapeutics targeting both Sars-CoV-2 and stroke thereby reducing the impact of the global pandemic.","Kakarla, Visesha; Kaneko, Naoki; Nour, May; Khatibi, Kasra; Elahi, Fanny; Liebeskind, David S; Hinman, Jason D",J Cereb Blood Flow Metab,382,33

We reviewed the current evidence on post-COVID syndrome, focusing on its clinical manifestations and addressing the challenges for its management in primary healthcare. The incidence of post-COVID syndrome is estimated at 10-35%, while for hospitalized patients it may reach 85%. Fatigue is the most common symptom reported in 17.5-72% of post-COVID cases, followed by residual dyspnea with an incidence ranging from 10-40%. Mental problems, chest pain, and olfactory and gustatory dysfunction may affect up to 26%, 22% and 11% of patients, respectively. More than one third of patients with post-COVID syndrome have pre-existing comorbidities, hypertension and diabetes mellitus being the most common. Beyond the prolonged duration of symptoms, the scarce published data indicate that most patients with post-COVID syndrome have a good prognosis with no further complications or fatal outcomes reported. Given the clinical spectrum of patients with post-COVID syndrome, most of them will be managed by primary healthcare professionals, in conjunction with pre-existing or new co-morbidities, which, in turn, may increase the burden of COVID-19 on primary healthcare. In conclusion approximately 10% of patients with COVID-19 may have symptoms persisting beyond three weeks, fulfilling the criteria of post-COVID syndrome. Primary healthcare professionals have a key role in the management of patients with post-COVID syndrome.

In the UK, ~50% of survivors will require additional rehabilitation. Despite this, there is currently no evidence-based guideline available in England and Wales that addresses the identification, timing and nature of effective interventions to manage the morbidity associated following COVID-19. It is now timely to accelerate the development and evaluation of a rehabilitation service to support patients and healthcare services. Nuffield Health have responded by configuring a scalable rehabilitation pathway addressing the immediate requirements for those recovering from COVID-19 in the community. Methods and Analysis: This long-term evaluation will examine the effectiveness of a 12-week community rehabilitation programme for COVID-19 patients who have been discharged following in-patient treatment. Consisting of two distinct 6-week phases; Phase 1 is an entirely remote service, delivered via digital applications. Phase 2 sees the same patients transition into a gym-based setting for supervised group-based rehabilitation. Trained rehabilitation specialists will coach patients across areas such as goal setting, exercise prescription, symptom management and emotional well-being. Outcomes will be collected at 0, 6, and 12 weeks and at 6- and 12-months. Primary outcome measures will assess changes in health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) and COVID-19 symptoms using EuroQol Five Dimension Five Level Version (EQ-5D-5L) and Dyspnea-12, respectively. Secondary outcome measures of the Duke Activity Status Questionnaire (DASI), 30 s sit to stand test, General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Patient Experience Questionnaire (PEQ) and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) will allow for the evaluation of outcomes, mediators and moderators of outcome, and cost-effectiveness of treatment. Discussion: This evaluation will investigate the immediate and long-term impact, as well as the cost effectiveness of a blended rehabilitation programme for COVID-19 survivors. This evaluation will provide a founding contribution to the literature, evaluating one of the first programmes of this type in the UK. The evaluation has international relevance, with the potential to show how a new model of service provision can support health services in the wake of COVID-19.

The study group consisted of 59 pregnant women feeding cats in the home and 369 pregnant women not feeding cats. A Health Anxiety Inventory (HAI-18) was used to measure the anxiety of all participants. Age and anxiety variables were analyzed using a two-sample independent t-test. Gravida, education, and job status were analyzed using chi-square tests, and live to abort ratio & pregnancy number were analyzed using Fisher exact test. Measurement of the anxiety level between the two groups showed that anxiety is significantly higher among the pregnant women who feed cats in their house with an average of 32.03±8.72. The average anxiety level among the pregnant women who don't have cats in their house was 25.94±8.99. The difference between the Health Anxiety Inventory of the two groups was significant (p= 0.0001) It was shown in the literature that pets can reduce anxiety but not studied in pregnant women, yet. Our results showed that pregnant women who own cats at home had more environmental anxiety than women who don’t feed cats at home which is possibly associated with fear of Toxoplasma gondii transmission. This anxiety may also cause unfavorable pregnancy outcomes like eclampsia, preterm birth, low birth weight and high incidence of cesarean delivery.","Yilmaz, T. U.; Cinar, S.; Altintas, L.; Guler, S.

Most of the researches focus on the qualitative properties or observations. In this research, we model the behaviours and collective intelligence of SARS-CoV-2 by minimal spanning trees (MSTs), which specify the underlying mechanisms of resource allocation in the viral colony. The vertices of the trees are 50 states, DC and NYC in the USA. The weights of the edges are assigned by the reciprocal of the sum of cases or deaths of COVID-19. The types of trees are decided by the chosen 18 factors. We sample 304 time-series data and compute their MST-based auto-correlations for stability analysis. Then we perform correlated analysis and comparative analysis on these stable factors. Our results show MST approach fits the collective intelligence modelling very well; the total cases and total deaths over areas are highly correlated in terms of MSTs; and these stable factors have little to do with the geographical distance. The results also indicate the colonisation of SARS-CoV-2 is pretty mature and organised. Based on the results, for environmental or health policies, we should also turn our attention to the transmission routes that are independent of or far away from human population or densities.

Adults develop respiratory symptoms, which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the most severe form, while children are largely spared from respiratory illness but can develop a life-threatening multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C)3-5. Here, we show distinct antibody responses in children and adults after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Adult COVID-19 cohorts had anti-spike (S) IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies, as well as anti-nucleocapsid (N) IgG antibody, while children with and without MIS-C had reduced breadth of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, predominantly generating IgG antibodies specific for the S protein but not the N protein. Moreover, children with and without MIS-C had reduced neutralizing activity as compared to both adult COVID-19 cohorts, indicating a reduced protective serological response. These results suggest a distinct infection course and immune response in children independent of whether they develop MIS-C, with implications for developing age-targeted strategies for testing and protecting the population.","Weisberg, Stuart P; Connors, Thomas J; Zhu, Yun; Baldwin, Matthew R; Lin, Wen-Hsuan; Wontakal, Sandeep; Szabo, Peter A; Wells, Steven B; Dogra, Pranay; Gray, Joshua; Idzikowski, Emma; Stelitano, Debora; Bovier, Francesca T; Davis-Porada, Julia; Matsumoto, Rei; Poon, Maya Meimei Li; Chait, Michael; Mathieu, Cyrille; Horvat, Branka; Decimo, Didier; Hudson, Krystalyn E; Zotti, Flavia Dei; Bitan, Zachary C; La Carpia, Francesca; Ferrara, Stephen A; Mace, Emily; Milner, Joshua; Moscona, Anne; Hod, Eldad; Porotto, Matteo; Farber, Donna L",Nat. immunol,382,22

Investigation of this viral infection in the human bronchial epithelial cell line (16HBE) suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can enter these cells through interaction between its membrane-localized S protein with the ACE2 molecule on the host cell membrane. Further observation indicates distinct viral replication with a dynamic and moderate increase, whereby viral replication does not lead to a specific cytopathic effect but maintains a continuous release of progeny virions from infected cells. Although mRNA expression of various innate immune signaling molecules is altered in the cells, transcription of IFN&#945;, IFNß and IFNÎ³ is unchanged. Furthermore, expression of some interleukins related to inflammatory reactions, such as IL-6, IL-2 and IL-8, is maintained at low levels, whereas that of interleukins involved in immune regulation is upregulated. Interestingly, IL-22, an interleukin that functions mainly in tissue repair, shows very high expression. Collectively, these data suggest a distinct infection process for this virus in respiratory epithelial cells, which may be linked to its clinicopathological mechanism.

O primeiro capítulo objetivou definir qual é o tempo adequado de aplicação do probiótico pós-cloração/decloração da água simulando a fase de preparação que precede a estocagem dos camarões; Além disso, a influência de Bacillus sp. sobre a densidade de Vibrio sp. Recomenda-se a aplicação de probióticos imediatamente após a desinfecção da água, e que a fertilização com carbono orgânico inicie 24 horas pós cloração/decloração da água. Através da adoção de tais procedimentos, torna-se possível obter-se uma redução de Vibrio sp. O segundo capítulo avaliou a influência do modo operacional do sistema de bioflocos na proteção contra Necrose Aguda do Hepatopâncreas (AHPND). Pós-larvas de L. vannamei foram cultivadas em 2 tipos de bioflocos, Autotrófico e Heterotrófico, com e sem probióticos. Após os 21 dias, os camarões foram desafiados com patógeno de AHPND em água clara e em bioflocos correspondentes a cada tratamento. Após 96 horas, observou-se um efeito protetor dos bioflocos heterotróficos, e autotróficos com probióticos, evidenciado pelas taxas de sobrevivência. O terceiro capítulo avaliou os efeitos da suplementação com probióticos na redução de lesões histopatológicas no hepatopâncreas (HP) ocasionadas por surto de vibriose, e compará-los em bioflocos e água clara. Após 30 dias, observou-se redução nas lesões do HP nos tratamentos com probióticos além de melhor desempenho zootécnico e sobrevivência dos camarões. O quarto capítulo comparou os efeitos dos probióticos sobre a densidade de Bacillus e Vibrio spp. no trato intestinal dos camarões cultivados em bioflocos e água clara. Verificou-se que o uso de probióticos reduziu a densidade de Vibrio sp., enquanto a abundância de Bacillus aumentou.

Current literature from the United States infers that only workers from limited socioeconomic groups have the ability to practice remote work. However, there has been little research on mobility disparity across income groups in US cities during the pandemic. The authors tried to fill this gap by quantifying the impacts of the pandemic on human mobility by income group in Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, Texas utilizing pseudonymized cell phone location data. A longitudinal study was performed on mobility as measured by the total travel distance, the radius of gyration, and the number of visited locations in April 2020 compared to the data in January and February 2020. An apparent disparity in mobility has been found across income groups. In particular, there was a strong negative correlation (\r{ho} = -0.90) between the estimated income bracket of a traveler and the travel distance in April. Furthermore, larger percentage drops among higher-income brackets in the radius of gyration and number of visited locations implied different adaptability in mobility. The findings of this study suggest a need to understand the reasons behind the mobility inflexibility among low-income populations during the pandemic.","Iio, Kentaro; Guo, Xiaoyu; XiaoqiangJackKong,; Rees, Kelly; Wang, Xiubin Bruce",,382,16

To this end, viruses have adopted several strategies to harness cellular metabolism in accordance with their specific demands. Most viruses upregulate specific cellular anabolic pathways and are largely dependent on such alterations. RNA viruses, for example, upregulate both glycolysisand glycogenolysis providing TCA cycle intermediates essential for anabolic lipogenesis. Also, these infections usually induce the PPP, leading to increased nucleotide levels supporting viral replication. SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19)that has so far spread from China throughout the world is also an RNA virus. Owing to the more metabolic plasticity of uninfected cells, a promising approach for specific antiviral therapy, which has drawn a lot of attention in the recent years, would be the targeting of metabolic changes induced by viruses. In the current review, we first summarize some of virus-induced metabolic adaptations and then based on these information as well as SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, propose a potential therapeutic modality for this calamitous world-spreading virus with the hope of employing this strategy for near-future clinical application.","Mansouri, Kamran; Rastegari-Pouyani, Mohsen; Ghanbri-Movahed, Maryam; Safarzadeh, Mehrnoush; Kiani, Sara; Ghanbari-Movahed, Zahra",Biomed Pharmacother,382,16

AIM: Conduct a seroprevalence study of IgG antibodies in Irish GP clinics. DESIGN AND SETTING: Participants were 172 staff and 799 patients of 15 general practices in the Midwest region of Ireland. METHODS: This seroprevalence study utilised 2 manufacturers' point-of-care (POC) SARS-CoV-2 IgM-IgG combined antibody tests, offered to patients and staff in general practice from mid-June to mid-July 2020. RESULTS: Immunoglobulin G (IgG) seroprevalence was 12.6% in patients attending general practice and 11.1% in staff working in general practice, with administrative staff having the lowest seroprevalence at 2.5% and nursing staff having the highest at 17.6%. Previous symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 and history of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test were associated with higher seroprevalence. IgG antibodies were detected in approximately 80% of participants who had a previous PCR-confirmed infection. Average length of time between participants' positive PCR test and positive IgG antibody test was 83 days. CONCLUSION: Patients and healthcare staff in general practice in Ireland had relatively high rates of IgG to SARS-CoV-2 compared to the national average at the time (1.7%). Four-fifths of participants with a history of confirmed COVID-19 disease still had detectable antibodies an average of 12 weeks post-infection. While not proof of immunity, SARS-CoV-2 POC testing can be used to estimate IgG seroprevalence in general practice settings.","O039,; Callaghan, Michael Edmund; Ryan, Elizabeth; Walsh, Cathal; Hayes, Peter; Casey, Monica; Dwyer, Pat; Culhane, Aidan; Duncan, John W; Harrold, Pat; Healy, Jarlath; Kerin, Emmet; Kelly, Eimear; Hanrahan, Conor; Lane, Ger P; Lynch, Bernie; Meaney, Paraic; Connell, Billy; Galvin, Jim; Kennedy, Norelee; Burke, Paul; Connell, Nuala H; Dunne, Colum P; Glynn, Liam G",,382,27

However, there is not much known about the cardiac tissue injury of CVD patients in relation to iAs exposure and potential role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of genes related to iAs metabolism, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction and inflammation which may play important roles in such CVD cases. In this dual center cross-sectional study, based on the exclusion and inclusion criteria, we have recruited 50 patients out of 270, who came from known arsenic-affected and- unaffected areas of mainly Chittagong, Dhaka and Rajshahi divisions of Bangladesh and underwent open-heart surgery at the selected centers during July 2017 to June 2018. We found that the patients from arsenic affected areas contained significantly higher average iAs concentrations in their urine (6.72 ± 0.54 ppb, P = 0.028), nail (529.29 ± 38.76 ppb, P < 0.05) and cardiac tissue (4.83 ± 0.50 ppb, P < 0.05) samples. Patients' age, sex, BMI, hypertension and diabetes status adjusted analysis showed that patients from arsenic-affected areas had significantly higher iAs concentration in cardiac tissue (2.854, 95%CI 1.017-8.012, P = 0.046) reflecting higher cardiac tissue injury among them (1.831, 95%CI 1.032-3.249, P = 0.039), which in turn allowed the analysis to assume that the iAs exposure have played a vital role in patients' disease condition. Adjusted analysis showed significant association between urinary iAs concentration with AA (P = 0.012) and AG (P = 0.034) genotypes and cardiac iAs concentration with AA (P = 0.017) genotype of AS3MT rs10748835. The AG genotype of AS3MT rs10748835 (13.333 95%CI 1.280-138.845, P = 0.013), AA genotype of NOS3 rs3918181 (25.333 95%CI 2.065-310.757, P = 0.002), GG genotype of ICAM1 rs281432 (12.000 95%CI 1.325-108.674, P = 0.010) and AA genotype of SOD2 rs2758331 (13.333 95%CI 1.280-138.845, P = 0.013) were found significantly associated with CVD patients from arsenic-affected areas. Again, adjusted analysis showed significant association of AA genotype of AS3MT rs10748835 with CVD patients from arsenic affected areas. In comparison to the reference genotypes of the selected SNPs, AA of AS3MT 10748835, AG of NOS3 rs3918181 and AC of rs3918188, GG of ICAM1 rs281432, TT of VCAM1 rs3176867, AA of SOD2 rs2758331 and GT of APOE rs405509 significantly increased odds of cardiac tissue injury of CVD patients from arsenic affected areas.

DESIGN: Scoping review. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Global Health, Cochrane, PsycINFO, PsychExtra, Web of Science and Scopus were searched for any paper from 2019 onwards that focused on the mental health impact of COVID-19 on imprisoned people and prison staff. A grey literature search focused on international and government sources and professional bodies representing healthcare, public health and prison staff was also performed. We also performed hand searching of the reference lists of included studies. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTION OF STUDIES: All papers, regardless of study design, were included if they examined the mental health of imprisoned people or prison staff specifically during the COVID-19 pandemic. Imprisoned people could be of any age and from any countries. All languages were included. Two independent reviewers quality assessed appropriate papers. RESULTS: Of 647 articles found, 83 were eligible for inclusion, the majority (58%) of which were opinion pieces. The articles focused on the challenges to prisoner mental health. Fear of COVID-19, the impact of isolation, discontinuation of prison visits and reduced mental health services were all likely to have an adverse effect on the mental well-being of imprisoned people. The limited research and poor quality of articles included mean that the findings are not conclusive. However, they suggest a significant adverse impact on the mental health and well-being of those who live and work in prisons. CONCLUSIONS: It is key to address the mental health impacts of the pandemic on people who live and work in prisons. These findings are discussed in terms of implications for getting the balance between infection control imperatives and the fundamental human rights of prison populations.","Johnson, Luke; Gutridge, Kerry; Parkes, Julie; Roy, Anjana; Plugge, Emma",BMJ Open,382,22

Although meat means an important source of nutrients, it is also evident that a great consumption of this source of proteins has also a negative environmental impact. Livestock production does not only have a negative influence on GHG emissions, but also on the water footprint, water pollution, and water scarcity. With respect to human health, in 2015 the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) stated that red meat was a probable carcinogen to humans (Group 2A), while consumption of processed meat was carcinogenic to humans (Group 1). Most environmental contaminants (PCDD/Fs, PCBs, PBDEs, PCNs, etc.) that are frequently found in meats are highly soluble in fats. Therefore, avoiding ingesting fats from red meats and meat products, doubtless would help in the prevention, not only of the well-known cardiovascular diseases derived of fats consumption, but also of certain kinds of cancers, mainly colorectal cancer. On the other hand, consumption of meat - especially wild meat - is related to virus infections, as many viruses have been found in wild meat trade markets. Based on the scientific literature here reviewed, we have noted that the results of the investigations conducted after the statement of the IARC, have corroborated the recommendation of reducing significantly the consumption of red meats and meat products. In turn, the reduction of meat consumption should contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions and their considerable impact on global warming and climate change. It seems evident that human dietary habits regarding meat consumption in general, and red meats and wild meats in particular, should be significantly modified downward, as much and as soon as possible.","González, Neus; Marquès, Montse; Nadal, Martí; Domingo, José L",Food Res Int,382,16

The goal of this study was to create a ""simulated"" daily readout (SDR) to restore the educational value of the daily readout. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To create the SDR the following tasks were performed; selection of cases for a daily worklist for each resident rotation, comprising a combination of normal and abnormal cases; determination of the correct number of cases and the appropriate mix of imaging modalities for each worklist; development of an ""educational"" environment consisting of separate ""instances"" of both our Picture Archive Communication System and reporting systems; and the anonymization of all of the cases on the worklists. Surveys of both residents and faculty involved in the SDR were performed to assess its effectiveness. RESULTS: Thirty-two residents participated in the SDR. The daily worklists for the first 20 days of the SDR included 3682 cases. An average of 480 cases per day was dictated by the residents. Surveys of the residents and the faculty involved in the SDR demonstrated that both agreed that the SDR effectively mimics a resident's daily work on rotations and preserves resident education during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 crisis. CONCLUSION: The development of the SDR provided an effective method of preserving the educational value of the daily readout experience of radiology residents, despite severe decreases in imaging exam volume and case mix diversity during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic.","Recht, Michael P; Fefferman, Nancy R; Bittman, Mark E; Dane, Bari; Fritz, Jan; Hoffmann, Jason C; Hood, Joseph; Mercado, Cecilia L; Mahajan, Sonia; Sheth, Monica M",Acad Radiol,382,24

The final sample comprised 189 libraries of all types with the exception of school libraries.FindingsResults indicated that Facebook is the most widely used platform, while social media are mainly used for sharing announcements about library operations and for the promotion of events. During the COVID-19 lockdown, libraries responded quickly to the new circumstances by taking many of their services online. However, they did not fully use social media for service provision but rather used social media as a static communication channel. Only a few of the libraries grasped the opportunity to highlight their role in the promotion of public health by providing timely and reliable information.Practical implicationsLibrary leaders who are looking to harness the power of social media for service promotion and outreach should build a strategy that takes platform popularity, current social media trends, patron preferences and the specific promotional objectives of their library into consideration.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors’ knowledge, the current research is the first which attempts to explore the social media presence of Greek libraries of all types and changes made to library operations and social media use in response to the COVID-19 lockdown.","Koulouris, Alexandros Vraimaki Eftichia Koloniari Maria",Reference Services Review,382,24

To assess its prevalence, it is necessary to have adequate models that allow real-time modeling of the impact of various quarantine measures by the state. The SIR model, which is implemented using a multi-agent system based on mobile cellular automata, was improved. The paper suggests ways to improve the rules of the interaction and behavior of agents. Methods of comparing the parameters of the SIR model with real geographical, social and medical indicators have been developed. That allows the modeling of the spatial distribution of COVID-19 as a single location and as the whole country consisting of individual regions that interact with each other by transport, taking into account factors such as public transport, supermarkets, schools, universities, gyms, churches, parks. The developed model also allows us to assess the impact of quarantine, restrictions on transport connections between regions, to take into account such factors as the incubation period, the mask regime, maintaining a safe distance between people, and so on. A number of experiments were conducted in the work, which made it possible to assess both the impact of individual measures to stop the pandemic and their comprehensive application. A method of comparing computer-time and dynamic parameters of the model with real data is proposed, which allowed assessing the effectiveness of the government in stopping the pandemic in the Chernivtsi region, Ukraine.

Infection after the first three post-operative weeks is treated with either one or two-stage revision operations involving the removal of all prosthetic components. Two-stage revision operations are more commonly used and involve the removal of prosthetic components followed by the implantation of a cement mold infused with antibiotics (antibiotic spacer) as well as systemic antibiotic treatment for four to six weeks before prosthetic reimplantation. This case report details a TKA revision in a patient with osteoarthritis of the knee. The patient presented with an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and white blood cell count nearly two years after the primary operation and was found to have an infected total knee prosthetic. A two-stage revision was planned but due to scheduling disruption by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the second stage of the operation was delayed until 12 months after the stage one operation. The patient ambulated without pain on an antibiotic spacer for 12 months, providing information about the long-term use of spacers. This case also offers a look at a potential benefit to one-stage operations, which have been shown in the literature to have similar outcomes as two-stage operations. The patient had a medical history of psoriasis and immunosuppressive treatment with methotrexate, two risk factors for prosthetic joint infection, and may have benefited from prophylactic antibiotic therapy extending beyond the perioperative period. The goal of this case report is to detail the prolonged use of an antibiotic spacer, examine the risks and benefits of one arid two-stage total knee revisions, and discuss prophylactic antibiotic use in high-risk patients following TKA.","Welsh, C.

The use of computer vision to automate the classification of medical images is widely studied. However, the standard convolutional neural network (CNN) does not necessarily employ subconscious feature relevancy evaluation techniques similar to the trained medical specialist and evaluates features more generally. Self-attention mechanisms enable CNNs to focus more on semantically important regions or aggregated relevant context with long-range dependencies. By using attention, medical image analysis systems can potentially become more robust by focusing on more important clinical feature regions. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive comparison of various state-of-the-art self-attention mechanisms across multiple medical image analysis tasks.

The pathogenesis is most often revealed by pulmonary conditions, including acute thoracic syndrome, which is affecting the life expectancy of these populations. The global spread of CoV2-SARS infection with a respiratory tropism, endothelial damages and procoagulant status endangers the SCD population. However, with only a few case reports, consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on SCD population remain poorly known. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 33-year-old man with a history of homozygous SS homozygous sickle cell anemia who consulted on March 24, 2020 for febrile dyspnea 11 days after the onset of symptoms. A nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2. His respiratory status worsened rapidly in the emergency room and then in ICU leading to severe ARDS requiring intubation, curarization, and venovenous ECMO. Hematologically, severe hemolysis associated with major thrombocytopenia without documented spinal cord injury was noted. Several transfusion exchanges are performed. The evolution was finally slowly favorable and led to discharge from the intensive care unit and then from the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: This case recalls the importance of an increased prevention policy against COVID-19among the SCD population. In addition, from a therapeutic point of view, it advocates (1) a high preventive anticoagulation from the outset according to the level of D-dimers (2) the use of venovenous ECMO in this particular case, whereas this technique has had rather disappointing results in acute chest syndromes. (3) Unexpectedly, our patient did not develop pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and acute cor pulmonale (ACP), whereas this is a common feature of ARDS during SCD. These last two observations suggest a different pathophysiology of pulmonary disorders in SCD patients in the case of SARS COv2. It could be associated with marked hypoxemia secondary to pulmonary vascular vasodilation.","Teulier, Marion; Elabbadi, Alexandre; Gerotziafas, Grigorios; Lionnet, François; Voiriot, Guillaume; Fartoukh, Muriel",BMC Pulm Med,382,14

Recent data suggest a prominent B cell germinal-center (GC) response elicited by mRNA vaccines in draining lymph nodes. Thus, in this study we aimed to explore the correlation between VAHL and humoral immunity as reflected by post-vaccination serologic testing and by comparing the incidence of VAHL between lymphoma patients treated recently with B cell depleting therapy and those that were not. METHODS: A total of 137 patients with hematologic malignancy that had post-vaccination [18F]FDG PET-CT were included (All-PET group), 86 received both vaccine doses before imaging (PET-2 group). Their VAHL status and grade on imaging were recorded. Among 102 lymphoma patients, 34 (33.3%) were treated during the year prior vaccination with anti-CD20 antibody containing therapy. A subgroup of 54 patients also underwent serologic testing 2-3 weeks after the booster dose, and their anti-spike titers were recorded and graded as well. RESULTS: The overall incidence of VAHL in patients with hematologic malignancy was 31.4%. The 34 lymphoma patients treated during the year prior vaccination with anti-CD20 antibody containing therapy had significantly lower rates of VAHL comparted with all other lymphoma patients (8.8 versus 41.2% in all-PET patients, Pv < 0.01). VAHL rates were 10% in patients with negative serology, 31.3% in patients with low anti-spike titers, and 72.2% in patients with high anti-spike titers. The positive predictive values of VAHL were 90 and 93.3% in all-PET and PET-2 patients, respectively. A positive statistically significant correlation was found between VAHL and serology ranks in All-PET patients (rs = 0.530, Pv < 0.001), and stronger correlation was found in PET-2 patients (rs = 0.642, Pv < 0.001). CONCLUSION: VAHL on [18F]FDG PET-CT of patients with hematologic malignancy may reflect GC B cell proliferation and an effective humoral response elicited by BNT162b2 vaccine.","Cohen, Dan; Hazut Krauthammer, Shir; Cohen, Yael C; Perry, Chava; Avivi, Irit; Herishanu, Yair; Even-Sapir, Einat",Eur. j. nucl. med. mol. imaging,382,16

The novelty of these molecules originates from the fact that the molecules are highly nonsymmetrical. One of the arms, which is either salicylaldimine or Schiff base core, possesses two vicinal fluorine atoms at the terminal ring having a -decyloxy tail; while the -alkyl tail attached to the other arm was varied to realize a homologous series of compounds. The mesophases have been characterized by several complementary studies. The banana-shaped systems having short or medium alkyl chain lengths form apolar columnar (two-dimensional) structures, while on ascending the series, a polar smectic phase is stabilized. Detailed electro-optical investigations on one of the polar smectic phases revealed a synclinic antiferroelectric (racemic) ground state structure, which switches, as expected, to an anticlinic ferroelectric state by the application of an electrical field. At higher field strengths applied for an extended time interval, the anticlinic ferroelectric state switches to a synclinic ferroelectric (chiral) state. Upon field removal, these domains switch to an anticlinic antiferroelectric (chiral) state, which eventually nucleates to the original antiferroelectric synclinic (racemic) state. Remarkably, the associated spontaneous polarization value exceeds 800 nC cm, which is among the highest reported hitherto.","Yelamaggad, Channabasaveshwar V; Shashikala, Indudhara Swamy; Hiremath, Uma S; Liao, Guangxun; Jakli, Antal; Rao, Doddamane S Shankar; Prasad, Subbarao Krishna; Li, Quan",Soft Matter,382,15

In the case of pure Hebbian learning, we find that the normalised weights equal the promotion probabilities of weights up to correction terms that depend on the learning rate and are usually small. A similar relation can be derived for STDP algorithms, where the normalised weight values reflect a difference between the promotion and demotion probabilities of the weight. These relations are practically useful in that they allow checking for convergence of Hebbian and STDP algorithms. Another application is novelty detection. We demonstrate this using the MNIST dataset.","Chu, Dominique; Nguyen, Huy Le",,382,20

An RT-PCR test cannot always ensure a safe differentiation of COVID-19- and non-diseased cases. Clinically challenging is that a reliable and time efficient decision regarding COVID-19 suspects requiring isolation. Therefore, this study was aimed at evaluating the significance of LUS in symptomatic patients with COVID-19 suspicion at hospital admission. A total of 101 patients admitted to a suspect ward with COVID-19-typical symptoms were assessed. All patients received prospectively a standardized LUS at admission. Patients were classified as LUS-positive and -negative cases based on a specific LUS score. The RT-PCR test in combination with the clinical findings served as a reference. Correctly classified were 14/15 COVID-19 diseased suspects as LUS-positive (sensitivity: 93.3%). Twenty-seven out of 61 non-positive cases were classified as false positive with LUS (specificity: 55.7%). In 34/35 patients who were assessed as LUS negative, no COVID-19 disease was detected during the hospitalization. The PPV and NPV of the LUS were 34.1% and 97.1%.

This consisted primarily of telephone and videophone visits from the home of psychiatric patients. By now, we seem to be facing protracted waves of epidemics, which could also mean a prolongation of the quarantine state, so changes in psychiatric patient care are even more necessary and will be expected, so telemedicine/telepsychiatry is expected to gain even more ground. The rapid development and introduction of the practical application of telepsychiatric applications, which appeared many years ago (mainly in the United States), can be expected. In the United States, for example, the frequency of telepsychiatric visits is predicted to be 47% for the near future, and the American Psychiatric Association is constantly publishing new and newer guidelines for telepsychiatry related to the COVID-19 epidemic.

The rapidity of its spread and the lack of detailed research on the course and methods of transmission significantly impede both its eradication and prevention. Scope and approach: Due to the high transmission rate and fatality resulting from COVID-19 disease, the paper focuses on analyzing the current state of knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 as well as its potential connection with food as a source of pathogen and infection. Key findings and conclusions: There is currently no evidence (scientific publications, WHO, EFSA etc.) that COVID-19 disease can spread directly through food and the human digestive system. However, according to the hypothesis regarding the primary transmission of the virus, the source of which was food of animal origin (meat of wild animals), as well as the fact that food is a basic necessity for humans, it is worth emphasizing that food can, if not directly, be a carrier of the virus. Particular attention should be paid to this indirect pathway when considering the potential for the spread of an epidemic and the development of prevention principles.","Duda-Chodak, Aleksandra; Lukasiewicz, Marcin; Ziec, Gabriela; Florkiewicz, Adam; Filipiak-Florkiewicz, Agnieszka",Trends Food Sci Technol,382,21

The first is work inspired by the Reproductive Justice Movement, that points to the intersectional axes of inequality that shape abortion discourse and position us in relation to reproductive choice and access issues. The second is work that examines the particularity of the constitution of the aborting body, reflecting the particularity of the pregnant body. This is a specific body, with a specific history; abortion discourse draws from and makes a significant contribution to the meaning and lived experience of this body. The third area of scholarship we highlight is that which seeks to amplify the meaning of abortion as a social good. Much abortion scholarship is attuned to a critique of negative aspects of abortion-from its representation in popular culture to restrictive law and access issues. This is critical work but/and the performative nature of abortion scholarship, like all discourse, means that it can amplify the association of negativity with abortion. The article concludes by introducing the articles contained in the special section of Women's Studies International Forum, 'Abortion at the edges: Politics, practices, performances'.","Baird, Barbara; Millar, Erica",Womens Stud Int Forum,382,24

One difficulty in deriving these quantities is that they must be computed on a model-by-model basis, since it is typically impractical to obtain general reproduction number expressions applicable to a family of related models, especially if these are of different dimensions. For example, this is typically the case for SIR-type infectious disease models derived using the linear chain trick (LCT). Here we show how to find general reproduction number expressions for such models families (which vary in their number of state variables) using the next generation operator approach in conjunction with the generalized linear chain trick (GLCT). We further show how the GLCT enables modelers to draw insights from these results by leveraging theory and intuition from continuous time Markov chains (CTMCs) and their absorption time distributions (i.e., phase-type probability distributions). To do this, we first review the GLCT and other connections between mean-field ODE model assumptions, CTMCs, and phase-type distributions. We then apply this technique to find reproduction numbers for two sets of models: a family of generalized SEIRS models of arbitrary finite dimension, and a generalized family of finite dimensional predator-prey (Rosenzweig-MacArthur type) models. These results highlight the utility of the GLCT for the derivation and analysis of mean field ODE models, especially when used in conjunction with theory from CTMCs and their associated phase-type distributions.","Hurtado, Paul J.; Richards, Cameron",,382,0

Italy registered its first case in the second half of February, and in a short time period, it became the top country in Europe in terms of the number of infected people and the first in the world in terms of deaths. The medical and scientific community has been called upon to manage the emergency and to take measures. Dentists also need to take new precautions during their clinical activity to protect themselves, coworkers and patients from the risks of contagion and to avoid further spread of infection. METHODS: Following the data published in the international literature as well as the guidelines and directives constantly updated by the WHO and by the national health authorities, a questionnaire to be completed anonymously was submitted online to Italian dentists using social tools and online professional platforms. The collected data were processed statistically, providing descriptive data and analysis of correlations of the most significant parameters using the Pearson's &#967;2, the Likelihood-Ratio &#967;2, Cramér's V, Fisher's exact test, Goodman and Kruskal's Î³, and Kendall's &#964;b (p < 0.05). RESULTS: A total of 535 dentists from Italy participated in the survey. A good level of scientific knowledge about coronavirus and the extra precautionary measures needed to limit the spread was related to the age of respondents and their sex. Coming from areas with higher concentrations of cases affected knowledge, level of attention and perception of risk related to dental activity. CONCLUSIONS: At the moment, there are no therapies or vaccines to contain the infection with the new coronavirus that is causing many infections, many of which are fatal, worldwide. Dentists are one of the categories at highest risk of encountering diseases and infections because they work in close proximity with patients, and in their procedures, there is always contact with aerosols with high bacterial and viral potential. Therefore, during this COVID-19 emergency, it is important that dentists are properly informed and take the appropriate precautionary measures.","Putrino, Alessandra; Raso, Mario; Magazzino, Cosimo; Galluccio, Gabriella",BMC Oral Health,382,16

This is an observational longitudinal study conducted at Fondazione Stella Maris (FSM), Italy to investigate lockdown-related emotional and behavioural changes in paediatric neuropsychiatric population. Families having children (1.5-18 years) with neuropsychiatric disorders referred to FSM have been contacted and proposed to fulfil two online questionnaires (General questionnaire and Child Behaviour Check List (CBCL)) to (i) compare (paired two-sample t-tests) the CBCL scores during lockdown with previous ones, and (ii) investigate the influence (multiple linear regression models) of variables such as age, diagnosis grouping (neurological, neurodevelopmental, emotional, and behavioural disorders) and financial hardship. One hundred and forty-one parents fulfilled the questionnaires. Anxiety and somatic problems increased in 1.5-5 years subpopulation, while obsessive-compulsive, post-traumatic and thought problems increased in 6-18 years subpopulation. In the regression models, younger age in the 1.5-5 years subpopulation resulted as ""protective"" while financial hardship experienced by families during lockdown was related to psychiatric symptoms increasing in the 6-18 years subpopulation.

Therefore, this research aims to identify the most frequent symptoms and comorbidities in SARS-CoV-2 infected outpatients; besides, to analyze hematological parameters and their correlation with cycle threshold (Ct) values. METHODS: We analyzed a total of sixty outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. They were divided according to sex. Afterward, a questionnaire was carried out to find out their symptoms and comorbidities. Additionally, blood biometry data were correlated with the Ct value, respectively. RESULTS: Sixty patients were analyzed; the mean age was 43 years. All patients were from Nayarit, Mexico. The frequency index showed that the main symptoms were headache and anosmia, and the comorbidities were obesity and smoking. The analysis of blood biometry showed a clear increase in red blood cells (RBC) related parameters in women. In both sexes an increase in the number of white blood cells (WBC) was observed. Also, all the hematological alterations correlated with the grade of infection. CONCLUSION: Headache and anosmia are the most common symptoms according to the frequency index, the main comorbidities were obesity and smoking.

However, research on their infection risk and clinical characteristics is limited. Objectives: To explore infection risk and clinical characteristics of HCWs with COVID-19 and to discuss possible prevention measures. Design, Setting, and Participants: This single-center case series included 9684 HCWs in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China. Data were collected from January 1 to February 9, 2020. Exposures: Confirmed COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: Exposure, epidemiological, and demographic information was collected by a structured questionnaire. Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic information was collected from electronic medical records. A total of 335 medical staff were randomly sampled to estimate the prevalence of subclinical infection among a high-risk, asymptomatic population. Samples from surfaces in health care settings were also collected. Results: Overall, 110 of 9684 HCWs in Tongji Hospital tested positive for COVID-19, with an infection rate of 1.1%. Of them, 70 (71.8%) were women, and they had a median (interquartile range) age of 36.5 (30.0-47.0) years. Seventeen (15.5%) worked in fever clinics or wards, indicating an infection rate of 0.5% (17 of 3110) among first-line HCWs. A total of 93 of 6574 non-first-line HCWs (1.4%) were infected. Non-first-line nurses younger than 45 years were more likely to be infected compared with first-line physicians aged 45 years or older (incident rate ratio, 16.1; 95% CI, 7.1-36.3; P < .001). The prevalence of subclinical infection was 0.74% (1 of 135) among asymptomatic first-line HCWs and 1.0% (2 of 200) among non-first-line HCWs. No environmental surfaces tested positive. Overall, 93 of 110 HCWs (84.5%) with COVID-19 had nonsevere disease, while 1 (0.9%) died. The 5 most common symptoms were fever (67 [60.9%]), myalgia or fatigue (66 [60.0%]), cough (62 [56.4%]), sore throat (55 [50.0%]), and muscle ache (50 [45.5%]). Contact with indexed patients (65 [59.1%]) and colleagues with infection (12 [10.9%]) as well as community-acquired infection (14 [12.7%]) were the main routes of exposure for HCWs. Conclusions and Relevance: In this case series, most infections among HCWs occurred during the early stage of disease outbreak. That non-first-line HCWs had a higher infection rate than first-line HCWs differed from observation of previous viral disease epidemics. Rapid identification of staff with potential infection and routine screening among asymptomatic staff could help protect HCWs.","Lai, Xiaoquan; Wang, Minghuan; Qin, Chuan; Tan, Li; Ran, Lusen; Chen, Daiqi; Zhang, Han; Shang, Ke; Xia, Chen; Wang, Shaokang; Xu, Shabei; Wang, Wei",JAMA Netw Open,382,10

People living with MS may experience a variety of symptoms as a consequence of this process, including many ""invisible"" symptoms that are internally manifested and not seen by others. Of the invisible symptoms of MS, which we have reviewed in a companion article, mood and mental health disorders are of particular concern due to their high prevalence and significant impact on patient quality of life. In this review, we showcase the experiences of patient authors alongside perspectives from healthcare provider authors as we promote awareness of the common mental health conditions faced by those living with MS, such as depression, anxiety, adjustment disorder, bipolar disorder, psychosis, and suicidal ideation. Many of these conditions stem in part from the increased stress levels and the many uncertainties that come with managing life with MS, which have been exacerbated by the environment created by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A patient-centered interdisciplinary approach, routine screening for mental health changes, and referral to specialists when needed can normalize discussions of mental health and increase the likelihood that people living with MS will receive the support and care they need. Management techniques such as robust social support, cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based interventions, and/or pharmacotherapy may be implemented to build resilience and promote healthy coping strategies. Increasingly, patients have access to telehealth options as well as digital apps for mental health management. Taken together, these approaches form an integrative care model in which people living with MS benefit from the care of medical professionals, a variety of support networks/resources, and self-management techniques for optimal mental health care.","Davis, Bryan E; Lakin, Lynsey; Binns, Cherie C; Currie, Keisha M; Rensel, Mary R",Neurol Ther,382,22

Here we show, for the first time, that Deep Learning techniques can be used to handle LMS users' interaction data and form a novel predictive model, namely DeepLMS, that can forecast the quality of interaction (QoI) with LMS. Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, DeepLMS results in average testing Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) [Formula: see text], and average correlation coefficient between ground truth and predicted QoI values [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text], when tested on QoI data from one database pre- and two ones during-Covid-19 pandemic. DeepLMS personalized QoI forecasting scaffolds user's online learning engagement and provides educators with an evaluation path, additionally to the content-related assessment, enriching the overall view on the learners' motivation and participation in the learning process.","Dias, Sofia B; Hadjileontiadou, Sofia J; Diniz, José; Hadjileontiadis, Leontios J",Sci Rep,382,5

It centres on the therapeutic proposal of a Marseilles doctor, who has become a very divisive ‘star’ in public debates over the efficacy of treatment. The author shows that competition between this doctor’s proposal and the commercial hopes of a major pharmaceutical company plays an important role. This company has managed to create links of interest with many other major doctors, some of whom are at the heart of the decision-making process concerning the management of the health crisis. Finally, the author places this episode within the broader question of the hold the drug industry has on scientific production within the medical field. The interdependence between health authorities and the pharmaceutical industry is anything but healthy. The Covid-19 debate conforms to a well-worn pattern of behaviour: public backlash over the transgressions of wealthy corporate actors, government regulatory responses insisting on greater levels of transparency, corporate circumvention of said regulations, resulting in the continuation of fraud and corruption.","Mucchielli, Laurent",J.

diseases, is no longer an exception Especially non communicable chronic diseases like Osteoarthritis (OA), Diabetes mellitus Type 2 (DMT2), overweight (OW) and obesity (OB) as well as cardio-vascular diseases (CVD) are examples of the most prevalent chronic conditions in industrial nations The treatment of multimorbidity has not gained much attention in research so far Especially conservative therapies other than medication have not been established for this specific population Physical exercise (PE) has been shown to be a treatment option with little adverse events and many positive effects for many single diseases, and physical activity (PA) promotion in general has found its way in many disease management programs However, a shortfall of research on the effectiveness of specific PE interventions in the treatment of multimorbidity must be stated The objective of this study therefore was to evaluate a pilot model aiming for behavior change towards the initiation and maintenance of regular PE and its related health benefits in patients with multimorbidity This abstract focuses on a subsample of participants with knee osteoarthritis Strength measures of the knee flexors and extensors and self-reported disease related symptoms were analyzed Methods: Participants with at least two severe risk factors or manifested disease signs for hip and/or knee OA, DMT2, OW/OB, CVD were included in the study The following analysis relates to the subsample of subjects with or at risk for knee OA The intervention consisted of two 12-week successive phases The first phase included different types of supervised aerobic and strength training sessions Dosage parameters were based on the national PA recommendations The intervention further comprised theoretical background information on training science, nutrition and behavioral change techniques as well as two personal counselling sessions with the aim to enable participants towards an autonomous exercise participation The second intervention phase enhanced the self-organized maintenance of the same level of PE In this phase, participants were contacted via email on a regular base They received weekly training logs and feedback on their logs as well as another personal counselling session Data were assessed at baseline (t0), after the first (t3) and after the second intervention phase (t6) Outcomes of this analysis relate to self-reported disease-related symptoms (WOMAC subscale pain and physical functioning) and isometric peak torque measures for knee flexion and extension The study was conducted in two recruitment waves for organizational reasons Due to the Covid-19 induced nationwide contact restrictions, strength measures could not be assessed for wave two at t3 in March 2020, therefore only t6 was used for further analysis of strength measures Wilcoxon Tests were calculated for non-parametric data to assess the changes between t0-t3 and t0-t6 Effect sizes were calculated using r The study is registered at the German clinical trial register (DRKS00016702) Results: N=39 patients were included in the study, thereof n=23 participants (females=19, males=4) showed disease signs or self-reported risk factors for knee OA The mean BMI of them was 30 3 ± 3 2 kg/m2 and the mean age was 58 3 ± 6 3 years Of the subsample, n=22 were also overweight or obese, n=16 had a diagnosis of hypertension, n=2 were diagnosed with DMT2 and n=16 had an elevated risk for DMT2 The WOMAC score was not answered by three participants at t3 One participant did not perform the knee extension test due to pain at t0 and t6 One participant did not perform the isometric torque at t6 due to an elevated blood pressure 2 participants were lost to follow-up due to family illness (n=1) and shortage of time caused by Covid-19 induced overtime (n=1) and did not provide any data at t6 Median values for WOMAC pain decreased from t0 to t3 but not from t0 to t6, this was not statistically significant The decrease for the subscale physical function from t0 to t3 and t6 was not statistically significant as well (Table 1) [Formula presented] There was a statistically significant change for isometric peak torque of knee extension Strength values for knee flexion increased as well, however this was not statistically significant (Table 2, Figure 1) [Formula presented] [Formula presented] Conclusions: Results of this study indicate that a systematic, initially supervised training can lead to objective health benefits in people with knee OA and multimorbidity Participants of the study showed an increase in maximal isometric force of knee extension with a large effect size This is an important finding for patients with risk factors as well as already manifested knee OA, as quadriceps strength is known as a protective factor for knee OA and its progression Results for the WOMAC showed marginal improvement throughout the intervention period The majority of people only had minor complaints at the beginning of the study, reducing the potential for positive change One limitation of the study is the onset of the Covid-19 related contact restrictions that prohibited strength measures as well as physical exercise training sessions in gyms and other public places for participants of wave 2 from the 9th intervention week on The influence of this force majeure on the results of the study cannot be conclusively assessed at this point Further limitations are related to the small sample size, especially for the subgroup of patients with OA, and the lack of a control group This was a pilot study for a randomized controlled trial in health services research which is already initiated Results of this pilot trial therefore indicate the feasibility and the potential benefit of this intervention for multimorbid patients with knee OA that will now be implemented and evaluated in a real health services setting in the near future","Schweda, S.; Janßen, P.; Sudeck,

Nasal airway obstruction and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) are closely related. The aim of this study was to use the 3D imaging software, ITK-SNAP as a platform to define a gold standard for anatomically accurate boundaries of the nasal airway in 3D CBCT and to create a more reliable and precise 3D CBCT segmentation of the nasal airway for assisting diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of nasal airway obstruction and OSAS. METHOD AND MATERIALS: After review of the literature to identify established parameters using CBCT and CT technology for the segmentation of the nasal airway, and the existing drawbacks, a gold standard for locating the anatomical boundaries of the nasal airway using CBCT is proposed. This new method aims at standardization of segmentation and quantification, allowing for more reliable comparison between studies. ITK-SNAP software was used to segment three CBCT samples of healthy patients aged 21 to 59 years, who were patients of record, with CBCT obtained for either orthodontic, endodontic, or prosthodontic treatment planning purposes. RESULTS: The literature search identified 11 studies describing nasal airway parameters utilizing CBCT and CT. A great variation was detected on where the anatomical boundaries for the nasal airway were selected. A new standard in the identification of anatomical boundaries of the nasal airway is proposed for consistent segmentation and quantification using 3D CBCT by using the following landmarks: the inferior ANS-PNS border, the anterior nares border, the posterior sella-PNS border, and superiorly the border in alignment with the base of the skull (excluding the ostia, frontal, ethmoidal, and sphenoidal air cells). The three segmented samples were volumetrically measured, and statistically analyzed. The mean average Hounsfield unit intensity using the CBCT samples in this study was 629 with a standard deviation of 190. CONCLUSION: The literature indicates a lack of a gold standard using CBCT technology for the segmentation of the nasal airway. With the proposed standard in this study, it is possible to quantify the nasal airway volume and thereby its reduction. For the general dental practitioner, this is an important aspect during the evaluation of overall airway assessment. This information can be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of airway compromised dental patients.","Mupparapu, Mel; Shi, Katherine J; Lo, Angela D; Setzer, Frank C",Quintessence Int,382,24

METHOD: In a phase I randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial involving 192 healthy adults 18-59 years old, two injections of three doses (50 EU, 100 EU, 150 EU) of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or placebo were administered intramuscularly at a 2- or 4-week interval. The safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine were evaluated. RESULTS: Vaccination was completed in 191 subjects. Forty-four adverse reactions occurred within 28 days, most commonly mild pain and redness at the injection site or slight fatigue. At days 14 and 28, the seroconversion rates were 87.5% and 79.2% (50 EU), 100% and 95.8% (100 EU), and 95.8% and 87.5% (150 EU), respectively, with geometric mean titers (GMTs) of 18.1 and 10.6, 54.5 and 15.4, and 37.1 and 18.5, respectively, for the schedules with 2-week and 4-week intervals. Seroconversion was associated with synchronous upregulation of antibodies against the S protein, N protein and virion and a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response. No cytokines and immune cells related to immunopathology were observed. Transcriptome analysis revealed the genetic diversity of immune responses induced by the vaccine. INTERPRETATION: In a population aged 18-59 years in this trial, this inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine was safe and immunogenic.

Because of the time needed to investigate certain causes of death and to process and review data, final annual mortality data for a given year are typically released 11 months after the end of the calendar year. Daily totals reported by CDC COVID-19 case surveillance are timely but can underestimate numbers of deaths because of incomplete or delayed reporting. As a result of improvements in timeliness and the pressing need for updated, quality data during the global COVID-19 pandemic, NVSS expanded provisional data releases to produce near real-time U.S. mortality data.* This report presents an overview of provisional U.S. mortality data for 2020, including the first ranking of leading causes of death. In 2020, approximately 3,358,814 deaths occurred in the United States. From 2019 to 2020, the estimated age-adjusted death rate increased by 15.9%, from 715.2 to 828.7 deaths per 100,000 population. COVID-19 was reported as the underlying cause of death or a contributing cause of death for an estimated 377,883 (11.3%) of those deaths (91.5 deaths per 100,000). The highest age-adjusted death rates by age, race/ethnicity, and sex occurred among adults aged &#8805;85 years, non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) and non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) persons, and males. COVID-19 death rates were highest among adults aged &#8805;85 years, AI/AN and Hispanic persons, and males. COVID-19 was the third leading cause of death in 2020, after heart disease and cancer. Provisional death estimates provide an early indication of shifts in mortality trends and can guide public health policies and interventions aimed at reducing numbers of deaths that are directly or indirectly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ahmad, Farida B; Cisewski, Jodi A; Miniño, Arialdi; Anderson, Robert N",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,382,3

Complex systems, such as cities, demonstrate early-warning signals when they approach phase transitions responding to external perturbation, including crises, policy changes, and human behavior changes. In urban systems, population visits to POIs represent a state in the complex systems that are cities. These states may undergo phase transitions due to population response to pandemic risks and intervention policies. In this study, we conducted early-warning signal detection on population visits to POIs to examine population response to pandemic risks. We examined two early-warning signals, the increase of autocorrelation at-lag-1 and standard deviation, in time series of population visits to POIs in 17 metropolitan cities in the United States of America. The results show that: (1) early-warning signals for population response to COVID-19 were detected between February 14 and March 11, 2020 in 17 cities; (2) detected population response had started prior to shelter-in-place orders in 17 cities; (3) early-warning signals detected from the essential POIs visits appeared earlier than those from non-essential POIs; and 4) longer time lags between detected population response and shelter-in-place orders led to a less decrease in POI visits. The results show the importance of detecting early-warning signals during crises in cities as complex systems. Early-warning signals could provide important insights regarding the timing and extent of population response to crises to inform policy makers.","Li, Qingchun; Tang, Zhiyuan; Coleman, Natalie; Mostafavi, Ali",,382,24

While standard methods exist, they work best at coarse-grained national or state scales with abundant data, and struggle to accommodate the partial observability and sparse data common at finer scales (e.g., individual schools or towns). For example, case counts may be sparse when only a small fraction of infections are caught by a testing program. Or, whether an infected individual tests positive may depend on the kind of test and the point in time when they are tested. We propose a Bayesian framework which accommodates partial observability in a principled manner. Our model places a Gaussian process prior over the unknown reproduction number at each time step and models observations sampled from the distribution of a specific testing program. For example, our framework can accommodate a variety of kinds of tests (viral RNA, antibody, antigen, etc.) and sampling schemes (e.g., longitudinal or cross-sectional screening). Inference in this framework is complicated by the presence of tens or hundreds of thousands of discrete latent variables. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient stochastic variational inference method which relies on a novel gradient estimator for the variational objective. Experimental results for an example motivated by COVID-19 show that our method produces an accurate and well-calibrated posterior, while standard methods for estimating the reproduction number can fail badly.","Wilder, B.; Mina, M.; Tambe, M.; Assoc Advancement Artificial, Intelligence",35th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence / 33rd Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence / 11th Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence,382,1

The policy responses of governments to the pandemic should be integrated with public behavioral changes. This study examines public attitudes, practices and perceived quarantine competency in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive design using an online survey was employed. Convenience and snowball sampling were adopted, and 1022 valid responses were received. FINDINGS: Most respondents demonstrated satisfactory practices, including wearing face masks (76.5%), keeping a safe distance (97.8%) and appropriate hand hygiene (99.2%). Fear of stigma (8.9%) and of financial consequences (0%) were minimal drivers of underreporting of symptoms among the respondents, whereas uncertainty of the relevance of symptoms (30.3%) was a main cause of not reporting to health authorities. Most participants (73.4%) abided by government instructions due to fear of infection rather than of legal penalties. Participants, especially females and Saudi citizens, reported a high level of perceived quarantine competence (12.9 ± 2.59). Spearman's rho correlation showed a significant positive association between wearing face masks and other precautionary practices, including keeping a safe distance (0.25, P < .01) and frequent handwashing (0.224, P < .01), which rules out the concern that wearing face masks would result in less adherence of the participants to other protective measures. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that COVID-19 awareness programs should focus more on males and non-Saudi populations. We also recommend the development of screening protocols and education programs for asthmatic patients in Saudi Arabia to avoid the consequences of confusing COVID-19 symptoms with those of asthma.","Almarwani, Abdulaziz Mofdy; Aljohani, Mohammed Saeed; Eweda, Ghada",Int J Clin Pract,382,16

COVID-19 variants continue to arise and counteract vaccination efficacy. As such, preventative health measures, such as social distancing and stay at home mandates, will continue for the foreseeable future. Evidence on those at greatest risk for poor outcomes if infected with COVID-19 has rapidly come to light. It has become clear that those with unhealthy lifestyle characteristics, chronic disease risk factors and/or a confirmed diagnosis of one or more chronic conditions are at greatest risk for hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and death if infected with COVID-19. The cytokine storm is a phenomenon that has been posited as a pathophysiologic response to COVID-19 infection that leads to poor outcomes. The current graphical review illustrates the association between unhealthy lifestyle characteristics and increased vulnerability to the cytokine storm as well as the physiologic mechanisms healthy living behaviors elicit and decrease risk for the cytokine storm. Through this graphical review, we will demonstrate unhealthy lifestyle characteristics, chronic disease risk factors and diagnoses, and COVID-19 outcomes are intricately linked, creating a new global syndemic. It is also clear that a primary way to uncouple this syndemic is through increasing healthy living behaviors, as illustrated in this graphical review. Moving forward, healthy living medicine should be practiced with renewed vigor to improve human resiliency to health threats posed by both chronic disease and viral infections.","Arena, Ross; Bond, Samantha; Calvo, Isabel Romero; Lebowicz, Leah; Ozemek, Cemal; Severin, Richard; Laddu, Deepika; Faghy, Mark A; Lavie, Carl J; Carbone, Salvatore",Prog. cardiovasc. dis,382,24

After the stay-at-home order was issued in our county, imaging volumes at our institution decreased to approximately 46% of baseline volumes, similar to the experience of other radiology practices. Given the substantial differences in severity and timing of the disease in different geographic regions, estimating resumption of radiology volumes will be one of the next major challenges for radiology practices. We hypothesize that there are six major variables that will likely predict radiology volumes: (1) severity of disease in the local region, including potential subsequent ""waves"" of infection; (2) lifting of government social distancing restrictions; (3) patient concern regarding risk of leaving home and entering imaging facilities; (4) management of pent-up demand for imaging delayed during the acute phase of the pandemic, including institutional capacity; (5) impact of the economic downturn on health insurance and ability to pay for imaging; and (6) radiology practice profile reflecting amount of elective imaging performed, including type of patients seen by the radiology practice such as emergency, inpatient, outpatient mix and subspecialty types. We encourage radiology practice leaders to use these and other relevant variables to plan for the coming weeks and to work collaboratively with local health system and governmental leaders to help ensure that needed patient care is restored as quickly as the environment will safely permit.","Madhuripan, Nikhil; Cheung, Helen M C; Alicia Cheong, Li Hsia; Jawahar, Anugayathri; Willis, Marc H; Larson, David B",J Am Coll Radiol,382,21

OBJECTIVE: To examine psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression and sleep disorders among healthcare professionals working in an emergency department and a COVID-19 clinic. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study including healthcare professionals in the emergency department and other units serving patients with COVID-19, of a training and research hospital in Turkey. METHODS: 210 volunteers, including 105 healthcare professionals in the emergency department and 105 healthcare professionals working in other departments rendering services for COVID-19 patients, were included in this study. A sociodemographic data form and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HAD), Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), World Health Organization Quality of Life scale (WHOQOL-BREF-TR) and Religious Orientation Scale were applied to the volunteers. RESULTS: The perceived stress levels and PSQI subscores were found to be significantly higher among the volunteers working in the emergency department than among those in other departments. The risk of development of anxiety among women was 16.6 times higher than among men. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare professionals on the frontline need systematic regular psychosocial support mechanisms. Anxiety due to fear of infecting family members can be prevented through precautions such as isolation.

Xiaotangshan Designated Hospital, a severe acute respiratory syndrome hospital in 2003, was rapidly renovated and put into operation with the main tasks of screening and isolating symptomatic international arrivals at Beijing Capital International Airport, providing basic medical care for mild to moderate COVID-19-positive cases, and rapidly referring severe to critical COVID-19-positive cases to higher-level hospitals. During the month-long period of its operation, 2171 passengers were screened and 53 were confirmed as having COVID-19 (six severe to critical). We describe how the use of Xiaotangshan Designated Hospital in this way enabled the efficient grouping and assessment of passengers arriving from a foreign country, the provision of optimal patient care without compromising public safety and the prioritization of critically ill patients requiring life-saving treatment.

Our hospital in Gwangju metropolitan city experienced a healthcare-associated COVID-19 outbreak early in the third wave. The first confirmed COVID-19 patient was a symptomatic neurosurgery resident with high mobility throughout the hospital. We analyzed the transmission routes of nosocomial COVID-19 and discussed infection control strategies. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing results according to time point and evaluated transmission routes. RESULTS: Since COVID-19 was first confirmed in a healthcare worker (HCW) on 11/13/2020, we performed RT-PCR tests for all patients and caregivers and four complete enumeration surveys for all HCWs. We detected three clusters of nosocomial spread and several sporadic cases. The first cluster originated from the community outbreak spot, where an asymptomatic HCW visited, which led to a total of 22 cases. The second cluster, which included patient-to-patient transmission, originated from a COVID-19 positive caregiver before diagnosis and the third cluster involved a radiologist and a banker. We took measures to isolate Building 1 of the hospital for 17 days and controlled the outbreak during a period of increasing community COVID-19 prevalence.

One of the consequences of this policy is a significant change in electricity consumption patterns. Since load forecasting models rely on calendar or meteorological information and are trained on historical data, they fail to capture the significant break caused by the lockdown and have exhibited poor performances since the beginning of the pandemic. This makes the scheduling of the electricity production challenging, and has a high cost for both electricity producers and grid operators. In this paper we introduce adaptive generalized additive models using Kalman filters and fine-tuning to adjust to new electricity consumption patterns. Additionally, knowledge from the lockdown in Italy is transferred to anticipate the change of behavior in France. The proposed methods are applied to forecast the electricity demand during the French lockdown period, where they demonstrate their ability to significantly reduce prediction errors compared to traditional models. Finally expert aggregation is used to leverage the specificities of each predictions and enhance results even further.","Obst, David; Vilmarest, Joseph de; Goude, Yannig",,382,16

This makes it possible for administrative sectors and the population itself to become aware and act more precisely. In this work, a machine learning model based on the multilayer Perceptron artificial neural network structure was used, which effectively predicts the behavior of the series mentioned in up to six days. The model, which is trained with data from 30 countries together in a 20-day context, is assessed using global and local MSE and MAE measures. For the construction of training and test sets, four time series (number of: accumulated infected cases, new cases, accumulated deaths and new deaths) from each country are used, which are started on the day of the first confirmed infection case. In order to soften the sudden transitions between samples, a moving average filter with a window size 3 and a normalization by maximum value were used. It is intended to make the model's predictions available online, collaborating with the fight against the pandemic.","Borghi, P. H.; Zakordonets, O.; Teixeira, J. P.",Procedia Computer Science,382,26

In COVID-19 patients, interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels are significantly elevated. Blocking IL-6 preliminarily resulted in the improvement of this hyperinflammatory state. It is unknown which patients could require higher doses of tocilizumab to get out of the cytokine storm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients affected by COVID-19 pneumonia were included. All the patients underwent tocilizumab 8 mg/kg intravenously and were tested for serum IL-6 24 to 48 hours before and 12 to 48 hours after tocilizumab infusion. Comparisons between survivors and nonsurvivors were performed. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were discharged, while six patients died, with no clinical or laboratory differences between the two groups at baseline. IL-6 was not different at baseline (P = .41), while 24 to 48 hours post-tocilizumab IL-6 serum levels were significantly higher in nonsurvivors than in survivors (2398.5 [430.5-9372] vs 290.5 [58.5-1305.5] pg/mL, P = .022). Serum IL-6 post-tocilizumab showed a good predictive ability to discriminate survivors from nonsurvivors (area under the curve, 0.815; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-0.99, P = .02). CONCLUSION: Repeated measurement of the serum level of IL-6 early after tocilizumab may distinguish nonsurvivors from survivors and support the choice of deeper targeting IL-6 in COVID-19 pneumonia.","Quartuccio, Luca; Sonaglia, Arianna; Pecori, Davide; Peghin, Maddalena; Fabris, Martina; Tascini, Carlo; De Vita, Salvatore",J. med. virol,382,1

After inhalation, aerosols containing SARS-CoV-2 penetrate to the depths of the lungs and cause severe pneumonia, alveolar injury, and life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Since there are no specific drugs or vaccines available to cure or prevent COVID-19 infection and COVID-19-related ARDS, a new therapeutic agent which will support oxygen supply and, at the same time, efficiently alleviate SARS-CoV-2-induced lung inflammation is urgently needed. Due to their potent immuno- and angiomodulatory characteristics, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may increase oxygen supply in the lungs and may efficiently alleviate ongoing lung inflammation, including SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS. In this review article, we described molecular mechanisms that are responsible for MSC-based modulation of immune cells which play a pathogenic role in the development of SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS and we provided a brief outline of already conducted and ongoing clinical studies that increase our understanding about the therapeutic potential of MSCs and their secretome in the therapy of COVID-19-related ARDS.","Harrell, Carl Randall; Jovicic, Biljana Popovska; Djonov, Valentin; Volarevic, Vladislav",Anal Cell Pathol (Amst),382,24

It further examines how the perception of vulnerability influences personal use of face masks by drivers, as well as on their insistence on appropriate masking behaviour by other persons on-board public transport. Overcrowding and unsanitary conditions in informal public transport in Africa could facilitate the spread of the corona virus. However, the use of face masks, among other enhanced mitigation measures significantly contain and minimize the spread of the virus. Primary data, obtained through surveys at five major public transport terminals in Accra, was analysed and interpreted using the Health Belief Model as an explanatory framework. Results indicate that most drivers have a high vulnerability perception to Covid-19. It further emerged that older drivers, in particular, consistently wore face masks and insisted on other persons in their commercial vehicles to follow suit. Socio-demographic factors, and the need to ensure one's personal safety and those of loved ones were critical determinants of face mask use among surveyed drivers. The study thus recommends that public awareness campaigns should strategically focus attention on the younger generation of drivers (i.e. 18-39 years) who perceived themselves to be immune to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Also, the collaborative efforts of state and non-state actors, like the transport operator unions, must be further strengthened if the gains made so far against Covid-19 is to be sustained.","Agyemang, Ernest; Agyei-Mensah, Samuel; Kyere-Gyeabour, Elvis",J. community health,382,16

However, no studies were conducted to explore the existence of the micro-structural changes in the central nervous system after infection. We aimed to identify the existence of potential brain micro-structural changes related to SARS-CoV-2. Methods: In this prospective study, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and 3D high-resolution T1WI sequences were acquired in 60 recovered COVID-19 patients (56.67% male; age: 44.10 ± 16.00) and 39 age- and sex-matched non-COVID-19 controls (56.41% male; age: 45.88 ± 13.90). Registered fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were quantified for DTI, and an index score system was introduced. Regional volumes derived from Voxel-based Morphometry (VBM) and DTI metrics were compared using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Two sample t-test and Spearman correlation were conducted to assess the relationships among imaging indices, index scores and clinical information. Findings: In this follow-up stage, neurological symptoms were presented in 55% COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients had statistically significantly higher bilateral gray matter volumes (GMV) in olfactory cortices, hippocampi, insulas, left Rolandic operculum, left Heschl's gyrus and right cingulate gyrus and a general decline of MD, AD, RD accompanied with an increase of FA in white matter, especially AD in the right CR, EC and SFF, and MD in SFF compared with non-COVID-19 volunteers (corrected p value <0.05). Global GMV, GMVs in left Rolandic operculum, right cingulate, bilateral hippocampi, left Heschl's gyrus, and Global MD of WM were found to correlate with memory loss (p value <0.05). GMVs in the right cingulate gyrus and left hippocampus were related to smell loss (p value <0.05). MD-GM score, global GMV, and GMV in right cingulate gyrus were correlated with LDH level (p value <0.05).

Recent works based on convolution neural networks have achieved good performance for this task. However, they are still limited in capturing structured relationships due to the nature of convolution. The shape of the pulmonary lobes affect each other and their borders relate to the appearance of other structures, such as vessels, airways, and the pleural wall. We argue that such structural relationships play a critical role in the accurate delineation of pulmonary lobes when the lungs are affected by diseases such as COVID-19 or COPD. In this paper, we propose a relational approach (RTSU-Net) that leverages structured relationships by introducing a novel non-local neural network module. The proposed module learns both visual and geometric relationships among all convolution features to produce self-attention weights. With a limited amount of training data available from COVID-19 subjects, we initially train and validate RTSU-Net on a cohort of 5000 subjects from the COPDGene study (4000 for training and 1000 for evaluation). Using models pre-trained on COPDGene, we apply transfer learning to retrain and evaluate RTSU-Net on 470 COVID-19 suspects (370 for retraining and 100 for evaluation). Experimental results show that RTSU-Net outperforms three baselines and performs robustly on cases with severe lung infection due to COVID-19.","Xie, Weiyi; Jacobs, Colin; Charbonnier, Jean-Paul; van Ginneken, Bram",IEEE Trans Med Imaging,382,1

A cross-sectional study was conducted in Shenzhen to detect anti-coronavirus antibodies including, immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and immunoglobulin A (IgA). In the COVID-19 group, nine patients were enrolled after diagnosis. In the control group, 1589 individuals without clinical symptoms (cough, fever, and fatigue) and returning from outside Shenzhen were enrolled. The first study enrollment occurred at the end of February 2020; the final study visit was 18 March 2020. In the COVID-19 group, the seven of nine patients were positive for IgM, IgG, and IgA. Meanwhile, six of the 1589 healthy individuals were found to be weakly positive for IgG. According to SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests, the six individuals were all negative. Strong supplemental support for clinical information can be provided by antibody detection, especially for IgA. According to comparison with overseas reports, the infection rate of the Chinese population outside Shenzhen, China, is significantly low, so most of the population in China is still susceptible. Hence, social distancing measures are still inevitable until a vaccine is developed successfully.","Zhang, Cantong; Lin, Liancheng; Tang, Donge; Liu, Fuju; Li, Meng; Li, Qiongying; Deng, Zhaoxiang; Chu, Guohai; Gu, Dayong; Dai, Yong",J Med Virol,382,21

Most people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have mild disease with unspecific symptoms, but about 5% become critically ill with respiratory failure, septic shock and multiple organ failure. An unknown proportion of infected individuals never experience COVID-19 symptoms although they are infectious, that is, they remain asymptomatic. Those who develop the disease, go through a presymptomatic period during which they are infectious. Universal screening for SARS-CoV-2 infections to detect individuals who are infected before they present clinically, could therefore be an important measure to contain the spread of the disease. Objectives: We conducted a rapid review to assess (1) the effectiveness of universal screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with no screening and (2) the accuracy of universal screening in people who have not presented to clinical care for symptoms of COVID-19. Search methods: An information specialist searched Ovid MEDLINE and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) COVID-19 Research Articles Downloadable Database up to 26 May 2020. We searched Embase.com, the CENTRAL, and the Cochrane Covid-19 Study Register on 14 April 2020. We searched LitCovid to 4 April 2020. The World Health Organization (WHO) provided records from daily searches in Chinese databases and in PubMed up to 15 April 2020. We also searched three model repositories (Covid-Analytics, Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study [MIDAS], and Society for Medical Decision Making) on 8 April 2020. Selection criteria: Trials, observational studies, or mathematical modelling studies assessing screening effectiveness or screening accuracy among general populations in which the prevalence of SARS-CoV2 is unknown. Data collection and analysis: After pilot testing review forms, one review author screened titles and abstracts. Two review authors independently screened the full text of studies and resolved any disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Abstracts excluded by a first review author were dually reviewed by a second review author prior to exclusion. One review author independently extracted data, which was checked by a second review author for completeness and accuracy. Two review authors independently rated the quality of included studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool for diagnostic accuracy studies and a modified form designed originally for economic evaluations for modelling studies. We resolved differences by consensus. We synthesized the evidence in narrative and tabular formats. We rated the certainty of evidence for days to outbreak, transmission, cases missed and detected, diagnostic accuracy (i.e. true positives, false positives, true negatives, false negatives) using the GRADE approach. Main results: We included 22 publications. Two modelling studies reported on effectiveness of universal screening. Twenty studies (17 cohort studies and 3 modelling studies) reported on screening test accuracy. Effectiveness of screening. We included two modelling studies. One study suggests that symptom screening at travel hubs, such as airports, may slightly slow but not stop the importation of infected cases (assuming 10 or 100 infected travellers per week reduced the delay in a local outbreak to 8 days or 1 day, respectively). We assessed risk of bias as minor or no concerns, and certainty of evidence was low, downgraded for very serious indirectness. The second modelling study provides very low-certainty evidence that screening of healthcare workers in emergency departments using laboratory tests may reduce transmission to patients and other healthcare workers (assuming a transmission constant of 1.2 new infections per 10,000 people, weekly screening reduced infections by 5.1% within 30 days). The certainty of evidence was very low, downgraded for high risk of bias (major concerns) and indirectness. No modelling studies reported on harms of screening. Screening test accuracy. All 17 cohort studies compared an index screening strategy to a reference reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. All but one study reported on the accuracy of single point-in-time screening and varied widely in prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, settings, and methods of measurement. We assessed the overall risk of bias as unclear in 16 out of 17 studies, mainly due to limited information on the index test and reference standard. We rated one study as being at high risk of bias due to the inclusion of two separate populations with likely different prevalences. For several screening strategies, the estimates of sensitivity came from small samples. For single point-in-time strategies, for symptom assessment, the sensitivity from 12 cohorts (524 people) ranged from 0.00 to 0.60 (very low-certainty evidence) and the specificity from 12 cohorts (16,165 people) ranged from 0.66 to 1.00 (low-certainty evidence). For screening using direct temperature measurement (3 cohorts, 822 people), international travel history (2 cohorts, 13,080 people), or exposure to known infected people (3 cohorts, 13,205 people) or suspected infected people (2 cohorts, 954 people), sensitivity ranged from 0.00 to 0.23 (very low- to low-certainty evidence) and specificity ranged from 0.90 to 1.00 (low- to moderate-certainty evidence). For symptom assessment plus direct temperature measurement (2 cohorts, 779 people), sensitivity ranged from 0.12 to 0.69 (very low-certainty evidence) and specificity from 0.90 to 1.00 (low-certainty evidence). For rapid PCR test (1 cohort, 21 people), sensitivity was 0.80 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.96; very low-certainty evidence) and specificity was 0.73 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.94; very low-certainty evidence). One cohort (76 people) reported on repeated screening with symptom assessment and demonstrates a sensitivity of 0.44 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.59; very low-certainty evidence) and specificity of 0.62 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.79; low-certainty evidence). Three modelling studies evaluated the accuracy of screening at airports. The main outcomes measured were cases missed or detected by entry or exit screening, or both, at airports. One study suggests very low sensitivity at 0.30 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.53), missing 70% of infected travellers. Another study described an unrealistic scenario to achieve a 90% detection rate, requiring 0% asymptomatic infections. The final study provides very uncertain evidence due to low methodological quality. Authors' conclusions: The evidence base for the effectiveness of screening comes from two mathematical modelling studies and is limited by their assumptions. Low-certainty evidence suggests that screening at travel hubs may slightly slow the importation of infected cases. This review highlights the uncertainty and variation in accuracy of screening strategies. A high proportion of infected individuals may be missed and go on to infect others, and some healthy individuals may be falsely identified as positive, requiring confirmatory testing and potentially leading to the unnecessary isolation of these individuals. Further studies need to evaluate the utility of rapid laboratory tests, combined screening, and repeated screening. More research is also needed on reference standards with greater accuracy than RT-PCR. Given the poor sensitivity of existing approaches, our findings point to the need for greater emphasis on other ways that may prevent transmission such as face coverings, physical distancing, quarantine, and adequate personal protective equipment for frontline workers.","Viswanathan, Meera; Kahwati, Leila; Jahn, Beate; Giger, Kayla; Dobrescu, Andreea Iulia; Hill, Christine; Klerings, Irma; Meixner, Jana; Persad, Emma; Teufer, Birgit; Gartlehner, Gerald",Cochrane Database Syst.

There is a concern that the pandemic will exacerbate the existing disparities in overall healthcare utilization and telehealth utilization. Few national studies have examined the changes in telehealth use during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Data on 6.8 and 6.4 million employer-based health plan beneficiaries in 2020 and 2019, respectively, were collected in 2020. Unadjusted rates were compared both before and after the week of the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic as a national emergency. Trends in weekly utilization were also examined using a difference-in-differences regression framework to quantify the changes in telemedicine and office-based care utilization while controlling for the patient's demographic and county-level sociodemographic measures. All analyses were conducted in 2020. RESULTS: More than a 20-fold increase in the incidence of telemedicine utilization after March 13, 2020 was observed. Conversely, the incidence of office-based encounters declined by almost 50% and was not fully offset by the increase in telemedicine. The increase in telemedicine was greatest among patients in counties with low poverty levels (ß=31.70, 95% CI=15.17, 48.23), among patients in metropolitan areas (ß=40.60, 95% CI=30.86, 50.34), and among adults than among children aged 0-12 years (ß=57.91, 95% CI=50.32, 65.49).

Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is an efficient screening technique via which lung infections can be detected. This paper aims to distinguish COVID-19 positive cases from the other four classes, including normal, tuberculosis (TB), bacterial pneumonia (BP), and viral pneumonia (VP), using CXR images. The existing COVID-19 classification researches have achieved some successes with deep learning techniques while sometimes lacking interpretability and generalization ability. Hence, we propose a two-stage classification method MANet to address these issues in computer-aided COVID-19 diagnosis. Particularly, a segmentation model predicts the masks for all CXR images to extract their lung regions at the first stage. A followed classification CNN at the second stage then classifies the segmented CXR images into five classes based only on the preserved lung regions. In this segment-based classification task, we propose the mask attention mechanism (MA) which uses the predicted masks at the first stage as spatial attention maps to adjust the features of the CNN at the second stage. The MA spatial attention maps for features calculate the percentage of masked pixels in their receptive fields, suppressing the feature values based on the overlapping rates between their receptive fields and the segmented lung regions. In evaluation, we segment out the lung regions of all CXR images through a UNet with ResNet backbone, and then perform classification on the segmented CXR images using four classic CNNs with or without MA, including ResNet34, ResNet50, VGG16, and Inceptionv3. The experimental results illustrate that the classification models with MA have higher classification accuracy, more stable training process, and better interpretability and generalization ability than those without MA. Among the evaluated classification models, ResNet50 with MA achieves the highest average test accuracy of 96.32 % in three runs, and the highest one is 97.06 % . Meanwhile, the attention heat maps visualized by Grad-CAM indicate that models with MA make more reliable predictions based on the pathological patterns in lung regions. This further presents the potential of MANet to provide clinicians with diagnosis assistance.","Xu, Yujia; Lam, Hak-Keung; Jia, Guangyu",,382,33

Nevertheless, continuity of care for patients suffering from other diseases represents a crucial challenge, and clinical research is no exception in this respect. This study aims to assess the impact of the strict Covid-19 lockdown on non-Covid-19 clinical research in the French University Hospital of Strasbourg. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical research activity (non-Covid-19) from the point of view of pharmacy department was estimated and compared to the pre-lockdown period. The impact of lockdown was assessed through five indicators: site initiation visits, the initiation of experimental therapies in non-Covid-19 patients, the delivery of non-Covid-19 investigational medical products, the number of drug shipments to patients' homes, and the number of monitoring or closure visits. RESULTS: During the study period, the number of site initiation visits decreased by 90%, total inclusions by 72%, and delivery of investigational medical products by 30%. During the lockdown period, 15 treatments were sent to patients' homes. Monitoring activity decreased by 98%.

During the current SARS-CoV2 pandemic, as well as earlier SARS and MERS epidemics, it has been observed that COVID19-positive women on average tend to have milder symptoms and lower fatality rates than men. There is a number of differences between the sexes known to contribute to different immune responses and severity of the disease, one being the effect of estrogen via estrogen receptor signalling. We wondered if estrogen might also affect the SARS-CoV2 more directly, perhaps by binding to the surface glycoprotein (S protein), thus possibly reducing its infectivity. Experimental approach. To assess whether there is a possibility for estrogen binding on the SARS-CoV2 S protein, we used BLAST and HHpred to compare protein sequences of S protein and human estrogen receptor β, while 3D structures of a potential estrogen binding site and an active site of estrogen receptor β were visualized and compared using PyMOL. Results and conclusions. By comparing the sequence of SARS-CoV2 S protein with the human estrogen receptor β, we identified a potential estrogen binding site on S protein and further determined that it also shares notable similarities with the active site of ER β when observed in 3D structure of their respective proteins. As a control, SARS-CoV2 S protein was compared with the human androgen receptor, and no such similarities were found. The potential estrogen binding site is part of coronavirus S2 superfamily domain, which is involved in host-virus membrane fusion during infection and appears to be conserved throughout the Coronaviridae family. Novelty and scientific contribution: This preliminary communication shows that SARS-CoV2 S protein features a potential estrogen binding site. Hopefully, this will prompt a more comprehensive study on the possibilities of estrogen binding on the S protein and the effect this might confer on the virus infectivity. © 2021, University of Zagreb.

We sought to evaluate adherence of the Beninese people to these preventive measures, in order to identify predictors of poor adherence and adapt the national response to COVID-19. Methods: two consecutive online surveys were conducted between May and August 2020. Four hundred and sixty two and 507 adult participants aged 18 years and above responded to the first and second survey respectively, with >70% being males. Results: more than 98% of respondents reported wearing face masks. A five-point adherence score was constituted by scoring observance to key preventive measures (mask use, physical distancing, hand hygiene, coughing hygiene and avoiding to touch one´s face). We observed that the mean adherence scores were fairly stable over time, respectively 4.08 and 4.03 during the first and second survey (p=0.439). Increasing age (aOR=1.043, 95% CI: 1.026 - 1.061; p<0.001) and obtaining COVID-19 information from official sources (aOR=1.628, 95% CI: 1.275 - 2.081; p<0.001) were significantly associated with higher adherence scores in a multivariable model. Conclusion: these findings suggest that a wide dissemination of adequate information about COVID-19 would increase adherence, and that targeted efforts should be directed towards increasing the compliance to preventive measures among the younger age groups.","Sessou, Philippe; Fodjo, Joseph Nelson Siewe; Jérôme, Charles Sossa; Farougou, Souaïbou; Colebunders, Robert",Pan Afr Med J,382,16

Therefore, this study evaluated the knowledge of health care workers with regard to COVID-19. A cross-sectional study was conducted from June 10-18, 2020. Participants were general practitioners, specialists, and nurses working at the forefront of the pandemic. Their knowledge, preventive behaviors, and risk perceptions concerning COVID-19 were evaluated using an online questionnaire created by our medical specialists. The questionnaire consisted of 29, 5, and 4 items about COVID-19 knowledge, preventive behaviors, and risk perceptions, respectively. A total of 251 health care workers completed the questionnaire. The mean age of the participants was 33.88±8.72 years old, and the sample consisted of 68 males (27.08%) and 183 females (72.91%). While there was no difference between the percentage of correct answers given by female and male participants to knowledge-based questions (p>0.05), the percentage of correct answers to the questions on preventive behaviors was significantly higher in female participants than in males (p<0.001). The overall average percentages of correct responses were 91.66% for knowledge-based questions and 85.96% for preventive behavior questions. The scores for knowledge-based questions were higher for medical specialists, whereas nurses scored higher on preventive behavior questions.

Shortages in reagents and vaccines are a major challenge, as well as limited knowledge on dose response relationship with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. We explored intradermal fractional dose administration of a mRNA SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 vaccine as a potential dose-sparing strategy. MethodsWe conducted a proof-of-concept, dose-escalation, open-label, randomised-controlled vaccine trial (IDSCOVA) in healthy adults aged 18-30 years. To test initial safety, ten participants received 10 {micro}g mRNA-1273 vaccine through intradermal injection at day 1 and 29. Following a favourable safety review, thirty participants were 1:1 randomised to receive 20 {micro}g mRNA-1273 either intradermally or intramuscularly. The primary endpoint was tolerability and safety. The secondary endpoint was seroconversion and specific IgG concentration against SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 and Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) after the second dose at day 43. We compared results to two historical cohorts of non-hospitalised COVID-19 patients and vaccinated individuals. FindingsThirty-eight of forty included participants (median age 25 years) completed the study. There were no serious adverse events. Self-reported local adverse reactions after intradermal delivery were mild, both in the 10 {micro}g and the 20 {micro}g group. In the higher dose group, systemic adverse reactions were more common, but still well tolerated. All 38 participants mounted substantially higher IgG-anti-S1 and IgG-anti-RBD concentrations at day 43 than COVID-19 controls. At day 43, anti-S1 (95% CI) was 1,696 (1,309-2,198) BAU/mL for the 10 {micro}g intradermal group, 1,406 (953{middle dot}5-2,074) BAU/mL for the 20 {micro}g intramuscular group and 2,057 (1,421-2,975) BAU/mL for the 20 {micro}g intradermal group.

EU member states acted in accordance with EU regulations and within their own legal system and the management structures. The aim of this paper was to analyze ten selected EU member states and their regulatory responses in the approach to pandemic control in relation to the mortality rate per million inhabitants on January 15, 2021. The following hypothesis was set: The regulatory systems and management structures of selected EU member states in the framework of the management of the COVID-19 pandemic have been successfully set up and implemented and have contributed to the lower mortality rate per million inhabitants until January 15, 2021. Ten EU countries were selected for the study according to their mortality rate per million inhabitants on January 15, 2021. Besides Croatia (average mortality), research included three member states with high (Belgium, Slovenia, Czechia), three with average (Hungary, Austria, Slovakia) and three with low mortality rate per million inhabitants (Ireland, Denmark, Finland). All available data from EU and ten selected countries were collected and analysed: about legal framework for crisis management, regulatory powers, level of decentralization in the health care system and whether the timeline of the pandemic control criteria according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) was adequately set. Data were analysed in MicrosoftOffice Excel. Given the obtained results, hypothesis can be considered only partially proven. The legal framework used by studied EU countries for adopting pandemic control measures was not consistently associated with morality rate in this research. All studied EU countries used legal framework that existed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, four of them had states of emergency provided in the Constitution (Czechia, Hungary, Slovakia and Finland), four of them effectively declared statutory regimes (Slovenia, Hungary, Croatia, Slovakia), and Belgium adopted pandemic control measures using special legislative powers. Three studied countries (Austria, Denmark, Finland) had high level of decentralised decision making in health sector and lower COVID-19 mortality rate. In the first pandemic wave (start in March, 2020) all studied countries respected the timeline in adopting pandemic control measures according to the IHME criteria. In the second pandemic wave (start in October, 2020) only four countries (Czechia, Ireland, Denmark, Finland) respected the timeline in adopting pandemic control measures and three (Ireland, Denmark, Finland) were in low mortality group. Within the concluding considerations of the studied countries and in their pandemic management models, Finland and Denmark were recognised as the most successful with lowest COVID-19 mortality rates. Long tradition of Public Health, decentralized health care decision- making, high level of preparedness in crisis management and adequate timeline in implementation of the pandemic control measures led to lower mortality in COVID-19 pandemic. In the future EU could take even more active role within its legal powers and propose scientific based approach in crisis management to help countries implement measures to preserve lives of EU citizens.","Pandžić, Marijeta Vitez College Professor Kovačević Jasmina M.

Bats in the order Chiroptera are widely distributed worldwide and are natural reservoirs of prominent zoonotic viruses, including Nipah virus, Marburg virus, and possibly SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we applied unbiased metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches to decipher the virosphere of frugivorous and insectivorous bat species captured in Guéckédou, Guinea, the epicenter of the West African Ebola virus disease epidemic in 2013-2016. Our study provides a snapshot of the viral diversity present in these bat species, with several novel viruses reported for the first time in bats, as well as some bat viruses closely related to known human or animal pathogens. In addition, analysis of Mops condylurus genomic DNA samples revealed the presence of an Ebola virus nucleoprotein (NP)-derived pseudogene inserted in its genome. These findings provide insight into the evolutionary traits of several virus families in bats and add evidence that nonretroviral integrated RNA viruses (NIRVs) derived from filoviruses may be common in bat genomes.","Hermida Lorenzo, Roberto J; Cadar, Dániel; Koundouno, Fara Raymond; Juste, Javier; Bialonski, Alexandra; Baum, Heike; García-Mudarra, Juan Luis; Hakamaki, Henry; Bencsik, András; Nelson, Emily V; Carroll, Miles W; Magassouba, N039; Faly,; Günther, Stephan; Schmidt-Chanasit, Jonas; Muñoz Fontela, César; Escudero-Pérez, Beatriz",,382,16

The present review paper discusses occurrence, fate, transport, susceptibility, and inactivation mechanisms of viruses in the environment as well as environmental occurrence and fate of antiviral drugs, and prospects (prevalence and occurrence) of antiviral drug resistance (both antiviral drug resistant viruses and antiviral resistance in the human). During winter, the number of viral disease cases and environmental occurrence of antiviral drug surge due to various biotic and abiotic factors such as transmission pathways, human behaviour, susceptibility, and immunity as well as cold climatic conditions. Adsorption and persistence critically determine the fate and transport of viruses in the environment. Inactivation and disinfection of virus include UV, alcohol, and other chemical-base methods but the susceptibility of virus against these methods varies. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are major reserviors of antiviral drugs and their metabolites and transformation products. Ecotoxicity of antiviral drug residues against aquatic organisms have been reported, however more threatening is the development of antiviral resistance, both in humans and in wild animal reservoirs. In particular, emergence of antiviral drug-resistant viruses via exposure of wild animals to high loads of antiviral residues during the current pandemic needs further evaluation.","Kumar, Manish; Mazumder, Payal; Mohapatra, Sanjeeb; Kumar Thakur, Alok; Dhangar, Kiran; Taki, Kaling; Mukherjee, Santanu; Kumar Patel, Arbind; Bhattacharya, Prosun; Mohapatra, Pranab; Rinklebe, Jörg; Kitajima, Masaaki; Hai, Faisal I; Khursheed, Anwar; Furumai, Hiroaki; Sonne, Christian; Kuroda, Keisuke",J Hazard Mater,382,5

ObjectiveTo investigate the prevalence of parents who have vaccinated their children against the COVID-19 and the factors influencing this decision. MethodsWe conducted a web-based cross-sectional study in Greece during the first week of September 2021. The study questionnaire was distributed through social media and a convenience sample was obtained. Only parents with children aged 12-17 years old could participate in the study. We collected socio-demographic data of parents and we measured their attitudes towards vaccination and COVID-19 pandemic. ResultsStudy population included 656 parents. Mean age of parents was 45.5 years, while most of them were mothers with a high level of education. Regarding vaccination, 27.1% of parents had their children vaccinated against the COVID-19, while almost all children had a complete vaccination history (98.9%). The most important reasons for decline of COVID-19 vaccination were doubts about the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines (45.3%) and fear of side effects (36.6%). Regarding the information about the COVID-19 vaccines, parents showed more trust in family doctors than in scientists and the government. Multivariate regression analysis identified that increased parents age, increased trust in COVID-19 vaccines, and positive attitude of parents towards vaccination had a positive effect on childrens vaccination. ConclusionsUnderstanding the factors influencing parents decision to vaccinate their children against the COVID-19 is crucial to increase the COVID-19 vaccination coverage rate. Implementation of public health policies is necessary to spread knowledge about COVID-19 vaccines and to regain vaccine confidence.","Galanis, Petros A; Vraka, Irene; Siskou, Olga; Konstantakopoulou, Olympia; Katsiroumpa, Aglaia; Moisoglou, Ioannis",,382,16

This study aimed to identify the active chemical constituents of this traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and investigate their mechanisms through interleukin-6 (IL-6) integrating network pharmacological approaches. METHODS: We collected the compounds from all herbal ingredients of the previously mentioned TCM, but those that could downregulate IL-6 were screened through the network pharmacology approach. Then, we modeled molecular docking to evaluate the binding affinity between compounds and IL-6. Furthermore, we analyzed the biological processes and pathways of compounds. Lastly, we screened out the core genes of compounds through the construction of the protein-protein interaction network and the excavation of gene clusters of compounds. RESULTS: The network pharmacology research showed that TCM could decrease IL-6 using several compounds, such as quercetin, ursolic acid, luteolin, and rutin. Molecular docking results showed that the molecular binding affinity with IL-6 of all compounds except Î³-aminobutyric acid was < -5.0 kJ/mol, indicating the potential of numerous active compounds in TCM to directly interact with IL-6, leading to an anti-inflammation effect. Finally, Cytoscape 3.7.2 was used to topologize the biological processes and pathways of compounds, revealing potential mechanisms for COVID-19 treatment. CONCLUSION: These results indicated the positive effect of TCM on the prevention and rehabilitation of COVID-19 in at-risk people. Quercetin, ursolic acid, luteolin, and rutin could inhibit COVID-19 by downregulating IL-6.","Liang, Chun; Niu, Wenhao; Wu, Feng; Cao, Wenyue; Wu, Zonggui; Chao, Yu Chieh; Peng, Fei",Biosci. rep,382,26

Drawing on 20 in-depth semi-structured interviews, the paper's findings suggest that, following a massive extension of transmedia work, remote workers experienced a 'fractured' and 'always-on' life. During the lockdown, the ever more pervasive role of digital media favoured the convergence of different spaces and times into the home, the erosion of the distinction between private and professional life and the exacerbation of previous social inequalities, especially inequalities in relation to gender and digital access.

This study aimed to explore the rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positivity in saliva and gastrointestinal fluids to which endoscopy medical staff are exposed. METHODS: The study was a single-center cross-sectional study. From June 1 to July 31, 2020, all patients who underwent GIE at Yokohama City University Hospital were registered. All patients provided 3 mL of saliva. For upper GIE, 10 mL of gastric fluid was collected through the endoscope. For lower GIE, 10 mL of intestinal fluid was collected through the endoscope. The primary outcome was the positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva and gastrointestinal fluids. We also analyzed serum-specific antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 and patients' background information. RESULTS: A total of 783 samples (560 upper GIE and 223 lower GIE samples) were analyzed. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on saliva samples did not show any positive results in either upper or lower GIE samples. However, 2.0% (16/783) of gastrointestinal fluid samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. No significant differences in age, sex, purpose of endoscopy, medication, or rate of antibody test positivity were found between PCR positive and PCR negative cases.

Lockdown levels are typically increased when the disease spreads and reduced when the disease abates. A predictive control approach is used to develop optimized lockdown strategies for curbing the spread of COVID-19. These strategies are then applied to South African data. The South African case is of immediate interest as the number of confirmed infectious cases does not appear to have peaked yet (at the time of writing), while at the same time the South African government is busy reducing the degree of lockdown. An epidemiological model for the spread of COVID-19 in South Africa was previously developed, and is used in conjunction with a hybrid model predictive controller to optimize lockdown management under different policy scenarios. Scenarios considered include how flatten the curve to a level that the healthcare system can cope with, how to balance lives and livelihoods, and what impact the compliance of the population to the lockdown measures has on the spread of COVID-19.","Olivier, Laurentz E.; Botha, Stefan; Craig, Ian K.",,382,16

METHODS: In February 2020, non-local medical workers who had been sent to Wuhan as support staff to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak were asked to complete an online survey composed of the Connor Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). RESULTS: Survey responses from 114 non-local medical workers were analyzed. CD-RISC scores were high (67.03 ± 13.22). The resilience level was highest for physicians (73.48 ± 11.49), followed by support staff, including health care assistants, technicians (67.78 ± 12.43) and nurses (64.86 ± 13.46). Respondents differed significantly in the levels of education, training/support provided by the respondent's permanent hospital (where he or she normally works), and in their feelings of being adequately prepared and confident to complete tasks (P < 0.05). Resilience correlated negatively with anxiety (r = -.498, P < 0.01) and depression (r = -.471, P < 0.01) but positively with active coping styles (r = .733, P < 0.01). Multiple regression analysis showed that active coping (ß = 1.314, p < 0.05), depression (ß = -.806, p < 0.05), anxiety (ß = - 1.091, p < 0.05), and training/support provided by the respondent's permanent hospital (ß = 3.510, p < 0.05) were significant associated with resilience. CONCLUSION: Our data show that active coping, depression, anxiety, and training/support provided by the respondent's permanent hospital are associated with resilience. Managers of medical staff should use these data to develop psychosocial interventions aimed at reinforcing the resilience of medical workers during highly stressful and prolonged medical emergencies, as seen during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Lin, Jing; Ren, Yun-Hong; Gan, Hai-Jie; Chen, Ying; Huang, Ying-Fan; You, Xue-Mei",BMC Psychiatry,382,6

Diabetes has been found a major risk factor for severe COVID-19. Mexico has a high prevalence of diabetes, estimated around 10.3%. On top of this, recent estimates suggest that 4.1% of the population has diabetes but does not have a proper diagnosis. We conducted a retrospective study in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in tertiary private hospital in Mexico City from March 15th to July 10th, 2020. We classified patients as having diabetes or prediabetes if it was registered in the electronical medical record. Patients were classified as newly diagnosed diabetes if they had an HbA1c on admission greater or equal than 6.5%. A total of 144 measurements of HbA1c were done on non-diabetic patients. Eighteen patients (12.5%) had a level of HbA1c equal or higher than 6.5%, while 70 (48.6%) patients had a level between 5.7% and 6.5%. Of the patients with HbA1c levels suggesting prior diabetes, 9 (50%) of them did not have hyperglycemia (&amp;gt;140 mg/dl) on admission. Our findings suggest that Mexican patients with COVID-19 might need HbA1c measurements regardless of glucose levels on admission since unknown diabetes is frequent and might modify in-hospital glucose management and discharge follow up and treatment.","Aguilar-Soto, Mercedes Cuenca Dalia Mercado Moises",Journal of the Endocrine Society,382,29

However, data are scarce concerning the trajectories of severe mental disorders after the end of c-/m-ECT. This prospective study investigates the clinical outcome of patients with versus without modifications of their c-/m-ECT schedules. METHODS: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, ECT capacities were restricted at many clinics in early 2020. All patients receiving c-/m-ECT in March and April 2020 at our department (n = 53, unipolar depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia) were followed up for six months to investigate the impact of treatment modifications imposed by the pandemic. Based on individual decisions, c-/m-ECT was either (a) continued without modification, (b) continued with reduced frequency, or (c) discontinued. RESULTS: Both reduced frequency and discontinuation of c-/m-ECT were associated with significant clinical deterioration as measured by CGI-I (Clinical Global Impression Scale - Global Improvement) during the six-month follow-up when compared to the subgroup of patients without any treatment modification (p = 0.005, p = 0.011). Furthermore, patients with discontinued or reduced c-/m-ECT showed significantly higher rates of rehospitalizations (p = 0.028) and new acute courses of ECT (p = 0.018). CONCLUSION: Despite the limitations of a heterogeneous and relatively small sample, our study strongly corroborates the effectiveness of c-/m-ECT in a real-world population. Especially, patients with shorter time since index ECT seem to be at high risk for severe clinical deterioration in the case of treatment discontinuation or reduction.","Methfessel, Isabel; Besse, Matthias; Belz, Michael; Zilles-Wegner, David",Acta psychiatr. scand,382,20

This article reports on the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) Be The Match Registry and its coordinating the provision of unrelated donor (URD) products to domestic and international TCs during the initial 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemic (March through May 2020). Specifically, NMDP data are presented for disease indications for transplant, URD search volumes and availability, graft requests and processing, courier utilization and performance, and conversion rates from formal donor search and workup to graft collection and shipment. Data following the onset of COVID-19 are compared to the immediate 3 months prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (December 2019 through February 2020) and the same quarter 1 year prior to COVID-19 (March through May 2019). During the initial onset of COVID-19 and compared to 1 year prior, TCs requested and the NMDP performed less donor searches. More multiple URD and direct to workup requests were processed by the NMDP, which likely reflected reductions in donor availability. Yet TCs continued to perform allogeneic transplants for acute disease indications like acute leukemia and myelodysplasia, using more cryopreserved grafts than before COVID-19. In comparison to prepandemic patient cycle conversion rates and durations, the NMDP was able to convert patient cycles at nearly the same or higher rates and in similar or shorter periods of time. Last, despite significant challenges caused by the pandemic, including interruptions in domestic courier services and travel restrictions, graft products were delivered to and received by TCs in similar periods of time than before COVID-19. Taken together, these data show that NMDP service line operations continued to function effectively during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring requests for and delivery of URD products to domestic and international allogeneic HCT recipients.","Auletta, Jeffery J; Novakovich, Jen L; Stritesky, Gretta L; Newman, Jeni; Fridy-Chesser, Sade T; Hailperin, Karl; Devine, Steven M",Transplant Cell Ther,382,26

This study investigated the changes of antibiotics, antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs), microbial communities, and their spatial distributions in a megacity river before and after river restoration. Results indicated that although the restoration activities including riverbed dredging, riverbank hardening, sewage and storm water separation and re-pipelining improved water quality such as by decreasing total phosphorus (TP) content from 4.60 ± 6.38 mg/L in 2018 to 0.98 ± 0.44 mg/L in 2020, the antibiotic concentrations in river water increased. Total antibiotic concentrations in the water samples were higher in 2020 (506.89-6952.50 ng/L) than those in 2018 (137.93-1751.51 ng/L), likely caused by increased usage of antibiotics in 2020 for COVID-19 treatment. The spatial distributions of antibiotics were less varied likely as a result of less retardation and fast mixing during antibiotic transport. The result also found that the abundance of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, and their correlations with ARGs increased. The spatial distributions of ARGs and microbial communities became less varied in the river water, consistent with the antibiotic variations before and after river restoration. Physicochemical changes such as decreased TP and dissolved organic carbon content may also be a factor. The results indicated that the current river restoration efforts were not effective in removing antibiotics, and implied that further studies are needed to investigate their subsequent transformation and transport, and to assess their risks to the health of ecosystems.","Zhang, Lili; Zhang, Cheng; Lian, Keting; Ke, Dongfang; Xie, Ting; Liu, Chongxuan",Sci Total Environ,382,1

Working creatively is a valuable means of accessing embodied knowledge and new insights about ourselves, our practice and our workplace cultures that can be used to inform development and transformation. However, being new to writing editorials, we first decided to have a look back through the journal’s editorial archives and seek the wisdom of previous authors. In doing so, it was interesting to see that our first Academic Editor, Professor Jan Dewing, had written an editorial about being creative back in May 2012;we encourage you to have a look. Jan began: ‘Yet again I recently heard someone saying they weren’t a creative person... ’and this is something we both experience when working with others. Is this because the word creativity is perceived to refer to the arts – for example, crafting, painting, movement and music – rather than a broader understanding, as suggested by the dictionary definition below: ‘The ability to transcend traditional ideas, rules, patterns, relationships, or the like, and to create meaningful new ideas, forms, methods, interpretations, etc.;originality, progressiveness, or imagination ’(dictionary.com). Taking this more expansive perspective opens up the possibility for us all to perceive ourselves as inherently creative. It could be argued that this creativity has come to the fore as we have adapted to new ways of living and working during the Covid-19 pandemic. While this crisis has brought huge uncertainty and challenge right across the complex mix of health and social care services, what has been remarkable is the ability people have shown to change their ways of working, to seek solutions – and to do so at pace. We believe this reflects the creative nature of human beings/persons. Oliver (2009) argues that creativity is everywhere, as humans and the world are constantly engaged in a process of making. He contends that we should view creativity as ‘openness’, which is person-oriented (Massey and Munt, 2009). In this way, we create the possibility for participatory exploration of the social, cultural and embodied context, and for improvisation and transformation, by engaging in people’s ‘interests, curiosities and passions ’(Massey and Munt, 2009, p 305).","Caroline, A.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the clinical practices of spine surgeons within the Asia Pacific region. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: COVID-19 pandemic had changed spine surgeons' clinical practices and their concerns toward personal and family risk of infection. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was carried out from May 4, 2020 to June 4, 2020. The questionnaire was administered using REDCAP. The online questionnaire includes four sections. First section includes surgeon's demographics, background, type of clinical practice, and status of pandemic in their country. Second section includes volume and the type of spine surgery practice before the COVID pandemic. Third section includes changes of clinical practice during the pandemic and the last section was regarding their concern on COVID transmission. RESULTS: Total of 222 respondents from 19 countries completed the questionnaire. During the pandemic, 92.3% of the respondents felt their clinical practice was affected. 58.5% respondents reported reduced outpatient clinic hours and 74.6% respondents reported reduced operation theatre hours due to the enforcement by the hospital administration. The mean reduction of clinic volume for all countries was 48.1%. There was a significant reduction in the number of surgeries performed in Japan, Malaysia, India, Philippines, and South Korea. This was due to reduced patient load. More than 60% of respondents were worried being infected by COVID-19 virus and >68% were worried of transmission to their family members. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the clinical and surgical practice of spine surgeons in the Asia Pacific region. Clinics were closed or the practice hours reduced. Similarly, surgical theaters were closed, reduced, or limited to semi-emergency and emergency surgeries. Spine surgeons were moderately concerned of contracting COVID-19 during their clinical practice but were extremely concerned to transmit this disease to their family members.

This review focuses on recent advances in optical forces, ranging from fundamentals to applications for biological exploration. First, the basics of different types of optical forces with new light-matter interaction mechanisms and near-field techniques for optical force generation beyond the diffraction limit with nanometer accuracy are described. Optical forces for biological applications from in vitro to in vivo are then reviewed. Applications from individual manipulation to multiple assembly into functional biophotonic probes and soft-matter superstructures are discussed. At the end future directions for application of optical forces for biological exploration are provided.","Xin, Hongbao; Li, Yuchao; Liu, Yong-Chun; Zhang, Yao; Xiao, Yun-Feng; Li, Baojun",Adv Mater,382,16

PURPOSE: The potentially vast supply of unused opioids in Americans' homes has long been a public health concern. We conducted a needs assessment of how Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities address and manage disposal of unused opioid medications to identify opportunities for improvement. METHODS: We used rapid qualitative content analysis methods with team consensus to synthesize findings. Data were collected in 2 waves: (1) semistructured interviews with 19 providers in October 2019 and (2) structured questions to 21 providers in March to April of 2020 addressing how coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) changed disposal priorities. RESULTS: While many diverse strategies have been tried in the VA, we found limited standardization of advice on opioid disposal and practices nationally. Providers offered the following recommendations: target specific patient scenarios for enhanced disposal efforts, emphasize mail-back envelopes, keep recommendations to providers and patients consistent and reinforce existing guidance, explore virtual modalities to monitor disposal activity, prioritize access to viable disposal strategies, and transition from pull to push communication. These themes were identified in the fall of 2019 and remained salient in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: A centralized VA national approach could include proactive communication with patients and providers, interventions tailored to specific settings and populations, and facilitated access to disposal options. All of the above strategies are feasible in the context of an extended period of social distancing.","Giannitrapani, Karleen F; Brown-Johnson, Cati; McCaa, Matthew; Mckelvey, Jeremiah; Glassman, Peter; Holliday, Jesse; Sandbrink, Friedhelm; Lorenz, Karl A",Am. j. health system pharm,382,6

To support the pathologists, a new technical professional role, the pathologists' assistant (PA), has been introduced. METHODS: We decided to carry out a retrospective analysis on PAs' performance. This was compared with that of junior/senior pathologists in the amount and type of surgical specimens examined, the number of lymph node retrieved in colorectal resections, the number of cases needing a second grossing procedure and the average time spent in grossing. As the COVID-19 pandemic period in fact resulted in a dramatic reduction of histological cases in our department, we divided PA activities into two periods, according to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: 'Simple' specimens made up the majority (92%) of the specimens examined by PAs in pre-COVID-19 period while 'complex' specimens, often neoplastic, represented the minor part (7%). However, 'simple' specimens dropped to 81% and 'complex' specimens rose to 18% in the COVID-19 period, when PAs had the chance to test themselves with more complicated surgical samples, under the supervision of a pathologist. Lymph node retrieval rate and average time spent in grossing are in line with literature data and confirm that PAs performance is comparable with pathologists' one, in selected settings. CONCLUSION: In our experience, PA has represented a fundamental time-saving resource for the pathologists, who can devote time almost exclusively to diagnostic reporting.","Bortesi, Mara; Marchetti, Marialisa; Arpaia, Ilaria; Marchi, Letizia; Ganassi, Marilena; Zanetti, Eleonora; Fontanesi, Cristina; Costantini, Massimo; Piana, Simonetta",J. clin. pathol,382,7

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19-associated skin manifestations and explore the relationships among the 6 main cutaneous phenotypes and systemic findings. METHODS: Twenty-one Italian Dermatology Units were asked to collect the demographic, clinical, and histopathologic data of 200 patients with COVID-19-associated skin manifestations. The severity of COVID-19 was classified as asymptomatic, mild, moderate, or severe. RESULTS: A chilblain-like acral pattern was significantly associated with a younger age (P < .0001) and, after adjusting for age, significantly associated with less severe COVID-19 (P = .0009). However, the median duration of chilblain-like lesions was significantly longer than that of the other cutaneous manifestations taken together (P < .0001). Patients with moderate/severe COVID-19 were more represented than those with asymptomatic/mild COVID-19 among the patients with cutaneous manifestations other than chilblain-like lesions, but only the confluent erythematous/maculo-papular/morbilliform phenotype was significantly associated with more severe COVID-19 (P = .015), and this significance disappeared after adjustment for age. LIMITATIONS: Laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 was not possible in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: After adjustment for age, there was no clear-cut spectrum of COVID-19 severity in patients with COVID-19-related skin manifestations, although chilblain-like acral lesions were more frequent in younger patients with asymptomatic/pauci-symptomatic COVID-19.","Marzano, Angelo Valerio; Genovese, Giovanni; Moltrasio, Chiara; Gaspari, Valeria; Vezzoli, Pamela; Maione, Vincenzo; Misciali, Cosimo; Sena, Paolo; Patrizi, Annalisa; Offidani, Annamaria; Quaglino, Pietro; Arco, Renato; Caproni, Marzia; Rovesti, Miriam; Bordin, Giorgio; Recalcati, Sebastiano; Potenza, Concetta; Guarneri, Claudio; Fabbrocini, Gabriella; Tomasini, Carlo; Sorci, Mariarita; Lombardo, Maurizio; Gisondi, Paolo; Conti, Andrea; Casazza, Giovanni; Peris, Ketty; Calzavara-Pinton, Piergiacomo; Berti, Emilio",J Am Acad Dermatol,382,12

In response to this global pandemic, various institutions across the globe had soon issued their prevention guidelines. Governments in the US had also implemented social distancing policies. However, those policies, which were designed to slow the spread of COVID-19, and its compliance, have varied across the states, which led to spatial and temporal heterogeneity in COVID-19 spread. This paper aims to propose a spatio-temporal model for quantifying compliance with the US COVID-19 mitigation policies at a regional level. To achieve this goal, a specific partial differential equation (PDE) is developed and validated with short-term predictions. The proposed model describes the combined effects of transboundary spread among state clusters in the US and human mobilities on the transmission of COVID-19. The model can help inform policymakers as they decide how to react to future outbreaks.","Yamamoto, Nao; Jiang, Bohan; Wang, Haiyan",,382,2

With an estimated incidence of 2/100,000 children, MIS-C is relatively rare, but can be fatal. Clinical features can include fever, hyperinflammatory state, gastrointestinal symptoms, myocardial dysfunction, and shock. The pathogenesis of MIS-C, although yet to be completely elucidated, appears to be distinct from KD in terms of epidemiology, severity, and biochemical signature. Methods: This comprehensive review searched AMED, EBM Reviews, Embase, Healthstar, MEDLINE, ERIC, and Cochrane for studies that reported treatments and outcomes of MIS-C. Results: The search strategy yielded 42 papers, from which 15 underwent full-text review (nâ¯=â¯386). A majority of children received intravenous immunoglobulin (77%) and some form of anticoagulation (63%). Steroid use was also common (44%), with immunotherapy used only in severe cases (nâ¯=â¯72). Outcomes reported included PICU admission (77%), need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (5%), and mortality (1.3%). Although efficacy of treatments for MIS-C have largely not yet been investigated, we propose close monitoring by a multidisciplinary team, symptomatic treatment (e.g., intravenous immunoglobulin for KD-like symptoms, steroids/immunotherapy for multisystem inflammation), and long-term follow-up. Conclusion: Although outcomes are largely favorable, management is based on a different disease entity (KD), which may not be appropriate given the likely pathophysiologic divergences. Further research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of current MIS-C treatments and to determine more refined therapies.","Kiss, Andreea; Ryan, Paul MacDaragh; Mondal, Tapas",Prog Pediatr Cardiol,382,20

The BBB regulates cellular and molecular exchange between the blood vessels and brain parenchyma. Normal functioning of the BBB is crucial for the homeostasis and proper function of the brain. It has been demonstrated that peripheral inflammation can disrupt the BBB by various pathways, resulting in different CNS diseases. Recently, clinical research also showed CNS complications following SARS-CoV-2 infection and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy, which both lead to a cytokine storm in the circulation. Therefore, elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the BBB disruption induced by peripheral inflammation will provide an important basis for protecting the CNS in the context of exacerbated peripheral inflammatory diseases.

However, there is a lack of a universal analytical framework to extract, quantify, and compare content features in public discourse of emerging health issues on different social media platforms across a broad sociocultural spectrum. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a novel and universal content feature extraction and analytical framework and contrast how content features differ with sociocultural background in discussions of the emerging COVID-19 global health crisis on major social media platforms. METHODS: We sampled the 1000 most shared viral Twitter and Sina Weibo posts regarding COVID-19, developed a comprehensive coding scheme to identify 77 potential features across six major categories (eg, clinical and epidemiological, countermeasures, politics and policy, responses), quantified feature values (0 or 1, indicating whether or not the content feature is mentioned in the post) in each viral post across social media platforms, and performed subsequent comparative analyses. Machine learning dimension reduction and clustering analysis were then applied to harness the power of social media data and provide more unbiased characterization of web-based health communications. RESULTS: There were substantially different distributions, prevalence, and associations of content features in public discourse about the COVID-19 pandemic on the two social media platforms. Weibo users were more likely to focus on the disease itself and health aspects, while Twitter users engaged more about policy, politics, and other societal issues. CONCLUSIONS: We extracted a rich set of content features from social media data to accurately characterize public discourse related to COVID-19 in different sociocultural backgrounds. In addition, this universal framework can be adopted to analyze social media discussions of other emerging health issues beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chen, Shi; Zhou, Lina; Song, Yunya; Xu, Qian; Wang, Ping; Wang, Kanlun; Ge, Yaorong; Janies, Daniel",J Med Internet Res,382,9

Data were from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the United States Renal Data System. Based on 2019 OPTN reports, annualized reduction in kidney transplantation of 25% to 100% could result in excess deaths of waitlisted (deceased donor) transplant candidates from 84 to 337 and living donor candidate excess deaths from 35 to 141 (total 119 to 478 potentially preventable deaths of transplant candidates). Changes in transplant activity due to COVID-19 varied with some centers shutting down while others simply heeded known or suspected pandemic risks. Understanding potential excess mortality for ESRD transplant candidates when circumstances compel curtailment of transplant activity may inform policy and procedural aspects of organ transplant systems allowing ways to best inform patients and families as to potential risks in shuttering organ transplant activity. Considering that more than 700,000 Americans have ESRD with 100,000 awaiting a kidney transplant, our highest annual estimate of 478 excess total deaths from postponing kidney transplantation seems modest.","Peters, Thomas G; Bragg-Gresham, Jennifer L; Klopstock, Annie C; Roberts, John P; Chertow, Glenn; McCormick, Frank; Held, Philip J",Clin Transplant,382,24

However, the effect of canakinumab on the total number of cardiovascular events, including recurrent events collected after a first event, is unknown. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine whether randomly allocated canakinumab would reduce the total burden of serious cardiovascular events. METHODS: We randomized 10,061 patients to placebo or canakinumab 50 mg, 150 mg, or 300 mg once every 3 months and compared the rates of the composite of all serious cardiovascular events (MI, stroke, coronary revascularization, and cardiovascular death) in active versus placebo groups. We used negative binomial regression to account for correlations among repeated events in the same person and to estimate rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: During a median of 3.7 years of follow-up, 3,417 total serious cardiovascular events occurred in 2,003 individuals among the 10,061 unique patients randomized. Canakinumab reduced the rates of total serious cardiovascular events, with rates per 100 person-years in the placebo, 50 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg canakinumab groups of 10.4, 8.4, 8.3, and 8.2, respectively. The corresponding rate ratios (95% confidence intervals) compared with placebo were 0.80 (0.69 to 0.93) for 50 mg, 0.79 (0.68 to 0.92) for 150 mg, and 0.78 (0.67 to 0.91) for 300 mg.

The approved vaccines are lifesaving yet temporary solutions to such a devastating pandemic. Viroporins are important players of the viral life cycle of SARS-Cov-2 and one of the primary determinants of its pathogenesis. We studied the two prominent viroporins of SARS-CoV-2 (i) Orf3a and (ii) Envelope (E) protein from a structural point of view. Orf3a has several hotspots of mutations which has been reported in SARS-CoV-2 with respect to SARS-CoV-1. Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 Orf3a channel forming residues enhances the formation of a prominent the inter-subunit channel, which was not present in the SARS-CoV-1 Orf3a. This enhanced structural feature can be correlated with higher channelling activity in SARS-CoV-2 than in SARS-CoV-1. On the other hand, E protein is one of the most conserved protein among the SARS-CoV proteome. We found that the water molecules form networks of electrostatic interactions with the polar residues in the E protein putative wetted condition while no water channel formation was observed in the putative dewetted condition. This aqueous medium mediates the non-selective translocation of cations thus affecting the ionic homeostasis of the host cellular compartments. This ionic imbalance leads to increased inflammatory response in the host cell. Our results shed light into the mechanism of viroporin action, which can be leveraged for the development of antiviral therapeutics. Furthermore, our results corroborate with previously published transcriptomic data from COVID-19 infected lung alveolar cells where inflammatory responses and molecular regulators directly impacted by ion channelling were upregulated. These observations overlap with transcript upregulation observed in diseases having acute lung injury, pulmonary fibrosis and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).

Most of the patients with COVID-19 suffer from mild flu-like illnesses such as cold and fever; however, few percentages of the patients progress from severe illness to death, mostly in an immunocompromised individual. The causative agent of COVID-19 is an RNA virus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Despite these debilitating conditions, no medication to stop the disease progression or vaccination is available till now. Therefore, we aimed to formulate a multi-epitope vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 by utilizing an immunoinformatics approach. For this purpose, we used the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein to determine the immunodominant T- and B-cell epitopes. After rigorous assessment, we designed a vaccine construct using four potential epitopes from each of the three epitope classes such as cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, helper T-lymphocyte, and linear B-lymphocyte epitopes. The designed vaccine was antigenic, immunogenic, and non-allergenic with suitable physicochemical properties and has higher solubility. More importantly, the predicted vaccine structure was similar to the native protein. Further investigations indicated a strong and stable binding interaction between the vaccine and the toll-like receptor (TLR4). Strong binding stability and structural compactness were also evident in molecular dynamics simulation. Furthermore, the computer-generated immune simulation showed that the vaccine could trigger real-life-like immune responses upon administration into humans. Finally, codon optimization based on Escherichia coli K12 resulted in optimal GC content and higher CAI value followed by incorporating it into the cloning vector pET28+(a). Overall, these results suggest that the designed peptide vaccine can serve as an excellent prophylactic candidate against SARS-CoV-2. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Aging comes along with circadian alteration, e.g. a disrupted sleep and inflammation, that leads to metabolic disorders. In turn, sleep cycle disturbances cause numerous pathophysiological changes that accelerates the aging process. In the central nervous system, sleep disruption impairs several functions, among them, the clearance of waste molecules. The decrease of plasma melatonin, a molecule of unusual phylogenetic conservation present in all known aerobic organisms, plays a particular role as far as the endocrine sequels of aging. Every day, the late afternoon/nocturnal increase of melatonin synchronizes both the central circadian pacemaker located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei as well as myriads of peripheral cellular circadian clocks. This is called the ""chronobiotic effect"" of melatonin, the methoxyindole being the prototype of the endogenous family of chronobiotic agents. In addition, melatonin exerts a significant cytoprotective action by buffering free radicals and reversing inflammation via down regulation of proinflammatory cytokines, suppression of low degree inflammation and prevention of insulin resistance. Because of these properties melatonin has been advocated to be a potential therapeutic tool in COVID 19 pandemic. Melatonin administration to aged animals counteracts a significant number of senescence-related changes. In humans, melatonin is effective both as a chronobiotic and a cytoprotective agent to maintain a healthy aging. Circulating melatonin levels are consistently reduced in the metabolic syndrome, ischemic and non-ischemic cardiovascular diseases and neurodegenerative disorders like the Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The potential therapeutic value of melatonin has been suggested by a limited number of clinical trials generally employing melatonin in the 2-10mg/day range. However, from animal studies the cytoprotective effects of melatonin need higher doses to become apparent (i.e. in the 100mg/day range). Hence, controlled studies employing melatonin doses in this range are urgently needed.","Cardinali, Daniel P",Vitam Horm,382,16

This cross-sectional study examined meat and poultry plants to assess possible risk factors. Companies completed a self-administered questionnaire on the work environment and protective measures taken to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for the possibility to distance at least 1.5 meters, break rules, and employment status was performed to identify risk factors associated with COVID-19 cases. Twenty-two meat and poultry plants with 19,072 employees participated. The prevalence of COVID-19 in the seven plants with more than 10 cases was 12.1% and was highest in the deboning and meat cutting area with 16.1%. A subsample analysis where information on maximal ventilation rate per employee was available revealed an association with the ventilation rate (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.996, 95% CI 0.993-0.999). When including temperature as an interaction term in the working area, the association with the ventilation rate did not change. When room temperatures increased, the chance of testing positive for COVID-19 (AOR 0.90 95% CI 0.82-0.99) decreased, and the chance for testing positive for COVID-19for the interaction term (AOR 1.001, 95% CI 1.000-1.003) increased. Employees who work where a minimum distance of less than 1.5 m between workers was the norm had a higher chance of testing positive (AOR 3.61; 95% CI 2.83-4.6). Our results further indicate that climate conditions and low outdoor air flow are factors that can promote the spread of SARS-CoV-2 aerosols. A possible requirement for pandemic mitigation strategies in industrial workplace settings is to increase the ventilation rate.","Pokora, Roman; Kutschbach, Susan; Weigl, Matthias; Braun, Detlef; Epple, Annegret; Lorenz, Eva; Grund, Stefan; Hecht, Juergen; Hollich, Helmut; Rietschel, Peter; Schneider, Frank; Sohmen, Roland; Taylor, Katherine; Dienstbuehl, Isabel",PLoS One,382,9

We use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained with both RF time-series images and the spectrograms of 15 different off-the-shelf drone controller RF signals. When using time-series signal images, the CNN extracts features from the signal transient and envelope. As the SNR decreases, this approach fails dramatically because the information in the transient is lost in the noise, and the envelope is distorted heavily. In contrast to time-series representation of the RF signals, with spectrograms, it is possible to focus only on the desired frequency interval, i.e., 2.4 GHz ISM band, and filter out any other signal component outside of this band. These advantages provide a notable performance improvement over the time-series signals-based methods. To further increase the classification accuracy of the spectrogram-based CNN, we denoise the spectrogram images by truncating them to a limited spectral density interval. Creating a single model using spectrogram images of noisy signals and tuning the CNN model parameters, we achieve a classification accuracy varying from 92% to 100% for an SNR range from -10 dB to 30 dB, which significantly outperforms the existing approaches to our best knowledge.","Ozturk, Ender; Erden, Fatih; Guvenc, Ismail",,382,1

More women than men have lost their jobs;more women than men are in essential jobs that expose them to infection and psychological stress, and women have had more work disruption than men have had because of increases in childcare and other responsibilities. On the other hand, telecommuting has increased men’s amount of childcare, and this does have the potential to increase men’s childcare responsibilities in the long term, thereby reducing the gender gap in domestic responsibilities and increasing gender equality.Research limitations/implicationsThe COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing and the research on the pandemic’s effects are new and ongoing.Originality/valueTo the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first scholarly review of the literature on the potential effects of COVID-19 on the gender gap in pay and advancement.","Carli, Linda L.",Gender in Management,382,1

It is understood that the emergency is characterized by limited time and information, harmfulness and uncertainty, and decision-makers are always critically bound by uncertainty and risk. This paper introduces many novel approaches to addressing the emergency situation of COVID-19 under spherical fuzzy environment. Fundamentally, the paper includes six main sections to achieve appropriate and accurate measures to address the situation of emergency decision-making. As the spherical fuzzy set (FS) is a generalized framework of fuzzy structure to handle more uncertainty and ambiguity in decision-making problems (DMPs). First, we discuss basic algebraic operational laws (AOLs) under spherical FS. In addition, elaborate on the deficiency of existing AOLs and present three cases to address the validity of the proposed novel AOLs under spherical fuzzy settings. Second, we present a list of Einstein aggregation operators (AgOp) based on the Einstein norm to aggregate uncertain information in DMPs. Thirdly, we are introducing two techniques to demonstrate the unknown weight of the criteria. Fourthly, we develop extended TOPSIS and Gray relational analysis approaches based on AgOp with unknown weight information of the criteria. In fifth, we design three algorithms to address the uncertainty and ambiguity information in emergency DMPs. Finally, the numerical case study of the novel carnivorous (COVID-19) situation is provided as an application for emergency decision-making based on the proposed three algorithms. Results explore the effectiveness of our proposed methodologies and provide accurate emergency measures to address the global uncertainty of COVID-19.","Ashraf, Shahzaib; Abdullah, Saleem",Int J Intell Syst,382,21

In this study, we investigated whether anti-influenza vaccination plays a role in minimizing the diffusion of COVID-19 in the Italian population aged 65 and over. Methods: Four COVID-19 outcomes were used: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seroprevalence, hospitalizations for COVID-19 symptoms, admissions to intensive care units for reasons related to SARS-CoV-2, and deaths attributable to COVID-19. Results: At univariate analyses, the influenza vaccination coverage rates correlated negatively with all COVID-19 outcomes (Beta ranging from -134 to -0.61; all p < 0.01). At multivariable analyses, influenza vaccination coverage rates correlated independently with SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence (Beta (95% C.I.): -130 (-198, -62); p = 0.001), hospitalizations for COVID-19 symptoms (Beta (95% C.I.): -4.16 (-6.27, -2.05); p = 0.001), admission to intensive care units for reasons related to SARS-CoV-2 (Beta (95% C.I.): -0.58 (-1.05, -0.12); p = 0.017), and number of deaths attributable to COVID-19 (Beta (95% C.I.): -3.29 (-5.66, -0.93); p = 0.010). The R2 observed in the unadjusted analysis increased from 82% to 159% for all the considered outcomes after multivariable analyses. Conclusions: In the Italian population, the coverage rate of the influenza vaccination in people aged 65 and over is associated with a reduced spread and a less severe clinical expression of COVID-19.

The association of parameters with maternal, AF and/or CB positivity and the influence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in AF and/or CB on neonatal outcomes were investigated. RESULTS: Overall 73.4% (80/109) were admitted in hospital due to COVID-19, 22.9% needed intensive care and there were four maternal deaths. Positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was observed in 14.7% of maternal blood, 13.9% of AF, 6.7% of CB, 2.1% of colostrum and 3.7% of OPS samples. The interval between COVID-19 symptoms and delivery was inversely associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity in the maternal blood (p = 0.002) and in the AF and/or CB (p = 0.049). Maternal viremia was associated with positivity for SARS-CoV-2 in AF and/or CB (p = 0.001). SARS-CoV-2 positivity in the compartments was not associated with neonatal outcomes. CONCLUSION: Vertical transmission is possible in pregnant women with COVID-19 and a shorter interval between maternal symptoms and delivery is an influencing factor.","Maeda, Mariane de Fátima Yukie; Brizot, Maria de Lourdes; Gibelli, Maria Augusta Bento Cicaroni; Ibidi, Silvia Maria; Carvalho, Werther Brunow de; Hoshida, Mara Sandra; Machado, Clarisse Martins; Sabino, Ester Cerdeira; Oliveira da Silva, Lea Campos de; Jaenisch, Thomas; Mendes-Correa, Maria Cássia Jacintho; Mayaud, Philippe; Francisco, Rossana Pulcinelli Vieira",Prenat Diagn,382,16

Yet, the impact of these crises is unevenly distributed across countries, leading to discrepancies in (inter)national crisis-regulating institutions? ability to uphold public trust and safeguard their constituents? well-being. Employing the paradigm of citizens as customers of political institutions, drawing on attribution and socio-political trust theories, and using the COVID-19 pandemic as empirical context, we investigate how consumers? relative perceptions of local impact following a global crisis affect the psychological processes of institutional trust-formation and consumer well-being. Conducting one survey-based study in two countries affected disproportionately by the pandemic?s first wave (USA, Greece) and one experimental study in a third country (Italy) during the pandemic?s second wave, we find that institutional trust declines more in countries whose citizens hold perceptions of higher relative local impact following a global crisis;institutional blame attributions explain trust erosion;institutional distrust decreases consumer well-being and adherence to institutional guidelines;consumers? globalization attitudes immunize international institutions from blame and distrust;and political conservatives transfer blame and distrust from national to international institutions amidst global crises. The findings enrich institutional branding and trust literatures and have implications for stakeholders involved in global crisis-management (policymakers, political marketers, institutional brand managers).","Davvetas, Vasileios Ulqinaku Aulona Abi Gülen Sarial",Journal of International Marketing,382,23

Serological tests can be used diagnostically and for surveillance, but their usefulness depends on their throughput, sensitivity and specificity. Here, we describe a multiplex fluorescent microsphere-based assay, 3Flex, that can detect antibodies to three major SARS-CoV-2 antigens-spike (S) protein, the spike ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), and nucleocapsid (NP). Specificity was assessed using 213 pre-pandemic samples. Sensitivity was measured and compared to the Abbottâ ARCHITECTâ SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay using serum samples from 125 unique patients equally binned (n = 25) into 5 time intervals (&#8804;5, 6 to 10, 11 to 15, 16 to 20, and &#8805;21 days from symptom onset). With samples obtained at &#8804;5 days from symptom onset, the 3Flex assay was more sensitive (48.0% vs. 32.0%), but the two assays performed comparably using serum obtained &#8805;21 days from symptom onset. A larger collection (n = 534) of discarded sera was profiled from patients (n = 140) whose COVID-19 course was characterized through chart review. This revealed the relative rise, peak (S, 23.8; RBD, 23.6; NP, 16.7; in days from symptom onset), and decline of the antibody response. Considerable interperson variation was observed with a subset of extensively sampled ICU patients. Using soluble ACE2, inhibition of antibody binding was demonstrated for S and RBD, and not for NP.

The term ""precision health"" is being increasingly used to express the need for greater awareness of environmental and genomic characteristics that may lead to divergent health outcomes between different groups within a population. Enhancing awareness of diversity has parallels with calls for ""health democracy"" and greater patient-public participation within health care and medical research. Approaching health care in this way goes beyond a narrow focus on the societal determinants of health, since it requires considering health as a deliberative space, which occurs often at the banal or everyday level. As an initial empirical focus, PHED is directed toward the health needs of marginalized migrants (including refugees and asylum seekers, as well as migrants with temporary residency, often involving a legally or economically precarious situation) as vulnerable groups that are often overlooked by health care. Developing new transdisciplinary knowledge on these groups provides the potential to enhance their wellbeing and benefit the wider society through challenging the exclusions of these groups that create pockets of extreme ill-health, which, as we see with COVID-19, should be better understood as ""acts of self-harm"" for the wider negative impact on humanity. OBJECTIVE: We aim to establish and identify precision health strategies, as well as promote equal access to quality health care, drawing upon knowledge gained from studying the health care of marginalized migrants. METHODS: The project is based in Sweden at Malmö and Lund Universities. At the outset, the network activities do not require ethical approval where they will not involve data collection, since the purpose of PHED is to strengthen international research contacts, establish new research within precision strategies, and construct educational research activities for junior colleagues within academia. However, whenever new research is funded and started, ethical approval for that specific data collection will be sought. RESULTS: The PHED project has been funded from January 1, 2019. Results of the transdisciplinary collaboration will be disseminated via a series of international conferences, workshops, and web-based materials. To ensure the network project advances toward applied research, a major goal of dissemination is to produce tools for applied research, including information to enhance health accessibility for vulnerable communities, such as marginalized migrant populations in Sweden. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to identify tools to enable the prevention and treatment of a wide spectrum of health-related outcomes and their link to social as well as environmental issues. There is also a need to identify and investigate barriers to precision health based on democratic principles.

These stressors are laid on top of a resident selection process already under duress with exploding application and interview numbers-the latter likely to be exacerbated with the widespread shift to virtual interviewing. Leveraging their trainee perspective, the authors propose enforcing a cap on the number of interviews that applicants may attend through a novel interview ticket system (ITS). Specialties electing to participate in the ITS would select an evidence-based, specialty-specific interview cap. Applicants would then receive unique electronic tickets-equal in number to the cap-that would be given to participating programs at the time of an interview, when the tickets would be marked as used. The system would be self-enforcing and would ensure each interview represents genuine interest between applicant and program, while potentially increasing the number of interviews-and thus match rate-for less competitive applicants. Limitations of the ITS and alternative approaches for interview capping, including an honor code system, are also discussed. Finally, in the context of capped interview numbers, the authors emphasize the need for transparent pre-interview data from programs to inform applicants and their advisors on which interviews to attend; learning from prior experiences and studies on virtual interviewing; adherence to best practices for interviewing; and careful consideration of how virtual interviews may shift inequities in the resident selection process.","Burk-Rafel, Jesse; Standiford, Taylor",Acad. med,382,21

Among rodent-borne diseases, the reservoir role of Norway rats of zoonotic parasites in cities has practically been ignored. Considering the parasitic diseases in the One Health approach, we intended to identify and quantify the zoonotic intestinal protozoans (ZIP) in an urban population of R. norvegicus in the city of Barcelona, Spain. We studied the presence of ZIP in 100 rats trapped in parks (n = 15) as well as in the city's sewage system (n = 85) in the winter of 2016/17. The protozoans were molecularly identified by means of a multiplex PCR (AllplexTM Gastrointestinal Panel-Parasite Assay). We also investigated the presence of co-infections among the species found. Four ZIP were identified, presenting significant prevalences in sewers, specifically Blastocystis (83.5%), Giardia duodenalis (37.7%), Cryptosporidium spp. (34.1%), and Dientamoeba fragilis (14.1%). Several co-infections among the detected ZIP were also detected. The reservoir role of ZIP that Norway rats play in cities as well as the role rats may play as sentinels of zoonotic parasites affecting humans in urban areas are strongly backed up by our findings. The increasing worldwide urbanization, climate change, and the COVID-19 pandemic are factors that are producing an increase in human-rat interactions. Our results should be considered a warning to the authorities to intensify rat control and surveillance in public health interventions.","Galán-Puchades, María Teresa; Trelis, María; Sáez-Durán, Sandra; Cifre, Susana; Gosálvez, Carla; Sanxis-Furió, Joan; Pascual, Jordi; Bueno-Marí, Rubén; Franco, Sandra; Peracho, Víctor; Montalvo, Tomás; Fuentes, Màrius Vicent",,382,1

METHODS: Basal hormone milieu, defective response of both innate and adaptive immune system and sedentariness are major determinants in the severity of influenza viral infection in obese patients. Being overweight not only increases the risk of infection and of complications for the single obese person, but a large prevalence of obese individuals within the population might increase the chance of appearance of more virulent viral strain, prolongs the virus shedding throughout the total population and eventually might increase overall mortality rate of an influenza pandemic. RESULTS: Waiting for the development of a vaccination against COVID-19, isolation of positive cases and social distancing are the primary interventions. Nonetheless, evidence from previous influenza pandemics suggests the following interventions aimed at improving immune response: (1) lose weight with a mild caloric restriction; (2) include AMPK activators and PPAR gamma activators in the drug treatment for obesity associated with diabetes; and (3) practice mild-to-moderate physical exercise. CONCLUSIONS: Due to prolonged viral shedding, quarantine in obese subjects should likely be longer than normal weight individuals.","Luzi, Livio; Radaelli, Maria Grazia",Acta Diabetol,382,1

University students are an important target group for prevention and health promotion and largely belong to an age group that is considered to play a leading role in propagating the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Germany. The paper deals with students' health information-seeking behavior before and during the corona crisis, aiming to give insights into its determinants and implications. Using the example of a large German comprehensive university and based on two cross-sectional surveys in the summer of 2019 (n = 4,351) and 2020 (n = 3,066), we investigate which information channels students use for health information, how information seeking changes during the course of the pandemic, and to what extent information seeking is associated with risk perception and risk behavior. For a subsample of participants that participated in both surveys (n = 443), we also trace developments at the individual level through a longitudinal analysis. The results show that students' health information seeking takes place primarily online and changed markedly during the corona crisis. The comparatively high relevance of sources that are largely based on unchecked user-generated content raises the concern whether students' health information-seeking behavior guarantees the necessary quality and reliability of health information. Significant correlations between the intensity of corona-related information seeking, risk perception, and actual risk behavior were found.","Schäfer, Markus; Stark, Birgit; Werner, Antonia M; Tibubos, Ana Nanette; Reichel, Jennifer L; Pfirrmann, Daniel; Edelmann, Dennis; Heller, Sebastian; Mülder, Lina Marie; Rigotti, Thomas; Letzel, Stephan; Dietz, Pavel",Front Public Health,382,16

However, the Union of the European Football Associations (UEFA) was keen to continue playing despite the pandemic and staged matches played behind closed doors. Thus, UEFA provided the involved parties with a strict protocol of how to organise and conduct matches in order to protect players and staff from contracting the virus, as well as to limit the risk of spreading the virus. This study provides a visual auto-ethnographical account of a European qualifier match between the women´s national teams of Iceland and Sweden. The match took place in September 2020, in the midst of the second wave of the Covid pandemic which was sweeping through Europe at the time. This visual story illustrates how the Covid pandemic was experienced in a team working quarantine and how it affected the social organisation of the match as shown by established rules and recommendations for human conduct and manifested in new norms of behaviour. The visual story further highlights how the pandemic imposed unprecedented challenges for sport teams to settle the conflicting forces of how to withhold manifested and collective team rituals under such constrains, as for the social organisations, which had to make-up protocols, at short notice, in order to keep the virus at bay. When analysed visually those protocols seemed inconsistent and illogical at times. It can however be argued, that despite those inconsistencies the protocols should be recognised as a responsible act for public welfare as they counter possible public health repercussions associated with such pandemics.

We compare the performance of Att-BiLSTM with traditional ontology-based method. The result on a benchmark dataset shows that Att-BiLSTM outperforms the ontology model. Att-BiLSTM achieves a precision of 0.942, recall of 0.810, and F1 of 0.871, while the ontology model only achieves a precision of 0.715, recall of 0.659, and F1 of 0.686.

The COVID-19 crisis could thus potentially slow down the transition to a low-carbon economy.

Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) has the potential of generating highly conformal and concave dose distributions around complex target and is ideally suited for HNC treatment. Conventionally, the focus of IMRT for HNC patients has been on prevention of radiation-induced parotid dysfunction. In the present article, we review the potential of IMRT to reduce the risk of posttreatment aspiration and dysphagia and spare submandibular gland. We also discuss the impact of IMRT on overall survival and quality of life (QoL) for HNC patients. Small retrospective and prospective studies show that reducing dose to adjoining organs at risks is feasible and decreases the risk of posttreatment dysphagia and aspiration without compromising local control. IMRT is associated with improved QoL in several important domains including swallowing, dry mouth, sticky saliva, social eating, and opening of the mouth; however, improvement in global QoL is inconsistent. Delivery of IMRT for HNC is associated with improved survival at nasopharyngeal subsite. Small studies demonstrate improved treatment outcomes with swallowing-sparing IMRT. These results now need validation within the prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial setting.","Sharma, Aman; Bahl, Amit",J Cancer Res Ther,382,1

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of hospital-based group medical quarantine (H-GMQ) on blood pressure (BP) in MHD patients, and the effect of age on change in BP. METHODS: MHD patients in our dialysis center who were under H-GMQ due to exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were enrolled. Their demographic data, clinical characteristics, and laboratory data were collected from 3 months before H-GMQ to the end of H-GMQ. They were divided into two groups by median age (61 y). BP and related data before and during H-GMQ between groups were analyzed. The association between age and change in BP was estimated using multivariable linear regression analysis. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty MHD patients were enrolled. The pre-dialysis systolic BP (SBP) and heart rate (HR) during H-GMQ were significantly higher than before, the serum sodium decreased significantly at the end of H-GMQ. After adjusting for covariates by multivariable regression, age had a negative correlation with BP elevation (R2 =0.218, P=0.246). Subgroup analysis showed that both pre-dialysis SBP and diastolic BP (DBP) increased significantly during H-GMQ in patients less than 61 years old, instead, neither SBP nor DBP changed in the elderly. CONCLUSIONS: H-GMQ increased the pre-dialysis BP in MHD patients, especially in younger patients. More attention should be paid to these patients' BP if another quarantine is needed.","Wang, Yan; Gan, Liangying; Zuo, Li; Yang, Bing; Wang, Ying; Liang, Junqing; Ni, Mengfan",Ann. palliat. med.

Evidence of the direct effects of diseases on human populations is generally elusive. Paleopathologists can identify some endemic diseases, but evidence from Africa is sparse.

I study whether health information technology (HIT) complements patient prescription data in PDMPs to reduce opioid-related mortality and morbidity. A novel dataset is constructed that records state policies that integrate PDMP with HIT and facilitate interstate data sharing. Using difference-in-differences models, I find that PDMP-HIT integration policies reduce opioid-related inpatient morbidity. The reductions are substantial in states that established integration without ever mandating the use of a PDMP. A mechanism test suggests that PDMP integration works mainly through the hospital system while a mandate affects legal opioids prescription. The impacts from integration are strongest for the vulnerable groups-middle-aged, low-to middle-income patients, and those with public insurance. There is suggestive evidence that interstate data sharing further complements integration despite not having a significant impact independently. The results are robust to a set of tests using alternative specifications and measures. The total benefits from integration far exceed the associated costs.","Wang, Lucy Xiaolu",Health econ,382,30

We aimed to examine this association, including interactions with demographic and behavioural characteristics, type 2 diabetes, and other health conditions. METHODS: In this prospective, community-based, cohort study, we used de-identified patient-level data from the QResearch database of general practices in England, UK. We extracted data for patients aged 20 years and older who were registered at a practice eligible for inclusion in the QResearch database between Jan 24, 2020 (date of the first recorded infection in the UK) and April 30, 2020, and with available data on BMI. Data extracted included demographic, clinical, clinical values linked with Public Health England's database of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results, and death certificates from the Office of National Statistics. Outcomes, as a proxy measure of severe COVID-19, were admission to hospital, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), and death due to COVID-19. We used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the risk of severe COVID-19, sequentially adjusting for demographic characteristics, behavioural factors, and comorbidities. FINDINGS: Among 6 910 695 eligible individuals (mean BMI 26·78 kg/m2 [SD 5·59]), 13 503 (0·20%) were admitted to hospital, 1601 (0·02%) to an ICU, and 5479 (0·08%) died after a positive test for SARS-CoV-2. We found J-shaped associations between BMI and admission to hospital due to COVID-19 (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] per kg/m2 from the nadir at BMI of 23 kg/m2 of 1·05 [95% CI 1·05-1·05]) and death (1·04 [1·04-1·05]), and a linear association across the whole BMI range with ICU admission (1·10 [1·09-1·10]). We found a significant interaction between BMI and age and ethnicity, with higher HR per kg/m2 above BMI 23 kg/m2 for younger people (adjusted HR per kg/m2 above BMI 23 kg/m2 for hospital admission 1·09 [95% CI 1·08-1·10] in 20-39 years age group vs 80-100 years group 1·01 [1·00-1·02]) and Black people than White people (1·07 [1·06-1·08] vs 1·04 [1·04-1·05]). The risk of admission to hospital and ICU due to COVID-19 associated with unit increase in BMI was slightly lower in people with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease than in those without these morbidities. INTERPRETATION: At a BMI of more than 23 kg/m2, we found a linear increase in risk of severe COVID-19 leading to admission to hospital and death, and a linear increase in admission to an ICU across the whole BMI range, which is not attributable to excess risks of related diseases. The relative risk due to increasing BMI is particularly notable people younger than 40 years and of Black ethnicity.

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) face unique challenges during the pandemic, including concerns regarding infection risk, drug shortages, limited access to care, social isolation, and mental health. This review will examine the multifaceted impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients living with RA. RECENT FINDINGS: In patients with RA, risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes include older age and comorbidities, similar to those in the general population. Glucocorticoids, but not other classes of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), appear to be associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. RA patients have been affected by changes in access to care, telemedicine, drug shortages, anxiety, and social isolation, which may contribute to disease flares. SUMMARY: Glucocorticoids, but not other DMARDs, are associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes in RA patients. Further studies are needed to explore the impact of specific DMARDs on COVID-19 outcomes, understand the broader implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on RA disease activity, and optimize the use of telemedicine in RA management.","D039,; Silva, Kristin M; Wallace, Zachary S",Curr Opin Rheumatol,382,23

With global interest in the Arctic on the rise, it becomes increasingly relevant to ensure that investments in arctic infrastructure actually serve the people of the Arctic, while promoting industrial and commercial innovation in the region through widespread access to broadband and Internet of Things (IoT) services. This calls for interdisciplinary research strategies that are able to connect and integrate technological and societal approaches, which are commonly applied separately and in isolation from one another. In this article, we propose an interdisciplinary collaborative research agenda for Arctic connectivity. Drawing on examples from Greenland, we stress the need for localized knowledge to design valuable and cost-effective connectivity solutions that cover the needs for everyday life and may also provide a new set of collaborative connectivity tools for innovation at an international level. Such solutions, termed 'frugal connectivity', are vital for the development of connected Arctic communities.","Abildgaard, Mette Simonsen; Ren, Carina; Leyva-Mayorga, Israel; Stefanovic, Cedomir; Soret, Beatriz; Popovski, Petar",,382,7

Today, COVID-19 patients or suspected cases are being stigmatised or labelled as ""corona carrier"" and ""corona spreader"" because of which they are facing social rejection, mental torture, abusive behaviour and violence in the society. The objectives of the present study are to examine the nature of stigma construction in Indian society during COVID-19 pandemic and to explore its outcome on the well-being of corona-affected people. Design/methodology/approach The study uses content analysis method to explain the COVID-19 stigma. The data have been collected from various Indian newspapers and magazines. The researchers have analysed the content of the news items related to social stigma which were collected from March to September 2020. Findings The study finds that COVID-19 patients or suspected cases are insulted and discriminated rudely by their family members and neighbours, and in many cases, they are not allowed to enter the house or the neighbourhood. The study has also pointed out that many COVID-19 patients or suspected cases have committed suicide as a result of being stigmatisation. Finally, the study explores that this social stigma is spreading due to fake news, lack of awareness and fear of corona infection. Originality/value This is an original paper which is based on content analysis. The present study focuses on the social stigma in Indian society during COVID-19. Basically, the present study has applied the theory of Erving Goffman which is based on stigma to examine the nature and problem of social stigma during COVID-19. The study has found that there are three types of social stigma during the corona pandemic: self-made stigma, family-made stigma and society-made stigma.","Sahoo, B. P.; Patel, A.

WhatsApp is being used as an important source of COVID-19-related information during the current pandemic. Unlike Facebook and Twitter, limited studies have investigated the role of WhatsApp as a source of communication, information, or misinformation during crisis situations. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to evaluate the vulnerability of demographic cohorts in a developing country toward COVID-19-related misinformation shared via WhatsApp. We also aimed to identify characteristics of WhatsApp messages associated with increased credibility of misinformation. METHODS: We conducted a web-based questionnaire survey and designed a scoring system based on theories supported by the existing literature. Vulnerability (K) was measured as a ratio of the respondent's score to the maximum score. Respondents were stratified according to age and occupation, and Kmean was calculated and compared among each subgroup using single-factor analysis of variance and Hochberg GT2 tests. The questionnaire evaluated the respondents' opinion of the veracity of coronavirus-related WhatsApp messages. The responses to the false-proven messages were compared using z test between the 2 groups: coronavirus-related WhatsApp messages with an attached link and/or source and those without. RESULTS: We analyzed 1137 responses from WhatsApp users in India. Users aged over 65 years had the highest vulnerability (Kmean=0.38, 95% CI 0.341-0.419) to misinformation. Respondents in the age group 19-25 years had significantly lower vulnerability (Kmean=0.31, 95% CI 0.301-0.319) than those aged over 25 years (P<.05). The vulnerability of users employed in elementary occupations was the highest (Kmean=0.38, 95% CI 0.356-0.404), and it was significantly higher than that of professionals and students (P<.05). Interestingly, the vulnerability of healthcare workers was not significantly different from that of other occupation groups (P>.05). We found that false CRWMs with an attached link and/or source were marked true 6 times more often than false CRWMs without an attached link or source (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that in a developing country, WhatsApp users aged over 65 years and those involved in elementary occupations were found to be the most vulnerable to false information disseminated via WhatsApp. Health care workers, who are otherwise considered as experts with regard to this global health care crisis, also shared this vulnerability to misinformation with other occupation groups. Our findings also indicated that the presence of an attached link and/or source falsely validating an incorrect message adds significant false credibility, making it appear true. These results indicate an emergent need to address and rectify the current usage patterns of WhatsApp users. This study also provides metrics that can be used by health care organizations and government authorities of developing countries to formulate guidelines to contain the spread of WhatsApp-related misinformation.","Bapaye, Jay Amol; Bapaye, Harsh Amol",JMIR Public Health Surveill,382,10

IVE analyses and reporting are conducted by public partners in the consortium. In 2019/20, four primary care-based test-negative design (TND) studies (Austria, England, Italy (n = 2)), eight hospital-based TND studies (Finland, France, Italy, Romania, Spain (n = 4)), and one population-based cohort study (Finland) were conducted. The COVID-19 pandemic affected influenza surveillance in all participating study sites, therefore the study period was truncated on February 29, 2020. Age-stratified (6 m-17y, 18-64y, &#8805;65y), confounder-adjusted, site-specific adjusted IVE estimates were calculated and pooled through meta-analysis. Parsimonious confounder-adjustment was performed, adjusting the estimates for age, sex and calendar time. TND studies included 3531 cases (351 vaccinated) and 5546 controls (1415 vaccinated) of all ages. IVE estimates were available for 8/11 brands marketed in Europe in 2019. Most children and adults < 64y were captured in primary care setting and the most frequently observed vaccine brand was Vaxigrip Tetra. The estimate against any influenza for Vaxigrip Tetra in primary care setting was 61% (95%CI 38-77) in children and 32% (95%CI -13-59) in adults up to 64y. Most adults &#8805; 65y were captured in hospital setting and the most frequently observed brand was Fluad, with an estimate of 52% (95%CI 27-68). The population-based cohort covered 511,854 person-years and two vaccine brands. In children aged 2-6y, the IVE against any influenza was 68% (95%CI 58-75) for Fluenz Tetra and 71% (56-80) for Vaxigrip Tetra. In adults &#8805; 65y, IVE against any influenza was 29% (20-36) for Vaxigrip Tetra. DRIVE is a growing platform.

To date, no commercial vaccines are available for control of the disease. In the present study, we isolated a field strain (NC1743) of TCoV and evaluated its pathogenicity in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) turkey poults to establish a TCoV disease model. The results showed that the TCoV NC1743 isolate was pathogenic to turkey poults with a minimal infectious dose at 106 EID50/bird. About 50 % of one-day-old SPF turkeys infected with the virus's minimal infectious dose exhibited typical enteric disease signs and lesions from 6 days post-infection (dpi) to the end of the experiment (21 dpi). In contrast, fewer than 20 % of older turkeys (1- or 2-week-old) infected with the same amount of TCoV displayed enteric disease signs, which disappeared after 15-18 dpi. Although all infected turkeys, regardless of age, shed TCoV, the older turkeys shed less virus than the younger birds, and 50 % of the 2-week-old birds even cleared the virus at 21 dpi. Furthermore, the viral infection caused day-old turkeys more body-weight-gain reduction than older birds. The overall data demonstrated that the TCoV NC1743 isolate is a highly pathogenic strain and younger turkeys are more susceptible to TCoV infection than older birds. Thus, one-day-old turkeys infected with the minimal infectious dose of TCoV NC1743 could be used as a TCoV disease model to study the disease pathogenesis, and the TCoV NC1743 strain could be used as a challenge virus to evaluate a vaccine protective efficacy.","Kang, Kyung-Il; Day, J Michael; Eldemery, Fatma; Yu, Qingzhong",Vet Microbiol,382,20

Whether the normal development of the gut-airway microbiome in children is affected by COVID-19 has not been evaluated. Here, we demonstrate that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection alters the upper respiratory tract and the gut microbiomes in nine children. The alteration of the microbiome is dominated by the genus Pseudomonas, and it sustains for up to 25-58 days in different individuals. Moreover, the patterns of alternation are different between the upper respiratory tract and the gut. Longitudinal investigation shows that the upper respiratory tract and the gut microbiomes are extremely variable among children during the course of COVID-19. The dysbiosis of microbiome persists in seven of eight children for at least 19-24 days after discharge from the hospital. Disturbed development of both the gut and the upper respiratory microbiomes and prolonged dysbiosis in these nine children imply possible long-term complications after clinical recovery from COVID-19, such as predisposition to the increased health risk in the post-COVID-19 era.","Xu, Rong; Liu, Pengcheng; Zhang, Tao; Wu, Qunfu; Zeng, Mei; Ma, Yingying; Jin, Xia; Xu, Jin; Zhang, Zhigang; Zhang, Chiyu",J. genet. genomics,382,13

MethodsWe performed the whole genome sequencing using SARS-CoV-2 positive samples (n=325) collected from February 2020 to the end of June 2021. The number of analyzed samples accounted for 15.4% of the total 2,109 samples identified in our community. Viral lineage was defined by the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak (PANGO) lineages. ResultsWe identified 13 types of viral lineages including R.1, P.1, B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) These virus lineages had distinct periods of expansion and decline. After the emerging of the R.1 lineage harboring E484K variant (designated VOI in Japan), the prevalent B.1.1.214 lineage were no longer identified. The R.1 lineages were temporarily prevalent afterwards, but the influx of B.1.1.7 lineage (designated VOC) led to a decline in R.1. Currently, B.1.1.7 has become dominant after mid-April, 2021. ConclusionWe clearly elucidated the transition and replacement of viral lineage by the community-based analysis. The virus completely replaced by more infectious lineages, therefore, it will be necessary to continue to monitor the VOC and VOI.","Hirotsu, Yosuke; Omata, Masao",,382,23

DESIGN: A prospective case-control study determined by admittance to the hospital based on bed availability. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen patients with COVID-19 infection (laboratory confirmed) severe pneumonia admitted to hospital between 20th March and 19th April 2020. Patients admitted to the hospital during the study period were assigned to different beds based on bed availability. Depending on the bed the patient was admitted, the treatment was ozone autohemotherapy or standard treatment. Patients in the case group received ozonated blood twice daily starting on the day of admission for a median of four days. Each treatment involved administration of 200 mL autologous whole blood enriched with 200 mL of oxygen-ozone mixture with a 40 µg/mL ozone concentration. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was time from hospital admission to clinical improvement. RESULTS: Nine patients (50%) received ozonated autohemotherapy beginning on the day of admission. Ozonated autohemotherapy was associated with shorter time to clinical improvement (median [IQR]), 7 days [6-10] vs 28 days [8-31], p = 0.04) and better outcomes at 14-days (88.8% vs 33.3%, p = 0.01). In risk-adjusted analyses, ozonated autohemotherapy was associated with a shorter mean time to clinical improvement (-11.3 days, p = 0.04, 95% CI -22.25 to -0.42). CONCLUSION: Ozonated autohemotherapy was associated with a significantly shorter time to clinical improvement in this prospective case-control study. Given the small sample size and study design, these results require evaluation in larger randomized controlled trials.

A narrative review was conducted with the aim of guiding clinicians on the management of pregnant women with respect to congenital, intrapartum, and postnatal maternal-fetal-neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infections and breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Searches were conducted in Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Dialnet, CUIDEN, Scielo, and Virtual Health Library to identify observational, case series, case reports, and randomized controlled trial studies assessing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mother to baby and/or through breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 49 studies was included in this review, comprising 329 pregnant women and 331 neonates (two pregnant women delivered twins). The studies were performed in China (n = 26), USA (n = 7), Italy (n = 3), Iran (n = 2), Switzerland (n = 1), Spain (n = 1), Turkey (n = 1), Australia (n = 1), India (n = 1), Germany (n = 1), France (n = 1), Canada (n = 1), Honduras (n = 1), Brazil (n = 1), and Peru (n = 1). Samples from amniotic fluid, umbilical cord blood, placenta, cervical secretion, and breastmilk were collected and analyzed. A total of 15 placental swabs gave positive results for SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) on the fetal side of the placenta. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in seven breastmilk samples. One umbilical cord sample was positive for SARS-CoV-2. One amniotic fluid sample tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents some evidence to support the potential of congenital, intrapartum, and postnatal maternal-fetal-neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infections during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Consequently, it is likely that these have been adversely impacted by COVID-19 outbreak due to disruptions to the schedules of children with ASD. AIM: This study investigated the stress and emotional well-being of parents of children with ASD in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: The study obtained quantitative data from 150 parents of children with ASD from different regions in Saudi Arabia using an online survey. The data collected included demographic data of the parents, ASD status of the family, ASD support during COVID-19 pandemic, severity of ASD behaviours in comparison to the pre- COVID-19 status eating behaviour of the child with ASD, Parental Stress, and emotional well-being. The PSI-short form (PSI-SF) (Abidin, 1995) scale was utilised to obtain data related to parental stress and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) (Goldberg, 1992) scale was utilised to obtain data related to parents' emotional well-being. RESULTS: The study found that family ASD status (in particular, age and gender of child with ASD, and severity of his/her symptoms) had a significant impact on parental stress and emotional well-being. Moreover, parental stress and emotional well-being were negatively impacted by the frequency and usefulness of ASD support received during COVID-19 pandemic. These were also adversely impacted by the change in severity of ASD behaviours of the children with ASD. Finally, parental stress was found to have a negative impact on the emotional well-being of parents. Overall, the study found that the parental stress and emotional well-being of parents of children with ASD in Saudi Arabia had been unfavourably impacted by COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the study found that the parental stress and emotional well-being of parents with ASD in Saudi Arabia had been unfavourably impacted by COVID-19 pandemic. This study recommends the involvement of the Saudi Ministry of Health to establish and extend support services to support parents of children with ASD. Moreover, the provision of training programs to help parents deal with the characteristic behaviour of their children with ASD such as, the ability to maintain routines, aggressive or repetitive behaviour, is also recommended.","Alhuzimi, Talal",Res Dev Disabil,382,1

One way to examine how the environment influences signals is by comparing changes in signal effectiveness in different habitats. Examinations of signal effectiveness between different habitats has helped to explain signal divergence/convergence between populations and species using acoustic and colour signals. Although previous research has provided evidence for local adaptations and signal divergence in many species of lizards, comparative studies in movement-based signals are rare due to technical difficulties in quantifying movements in nature and ethical restrictions in translocating animals between habitats. We demonstrate herein that these issues can be addressed using 3D animations, and compared the relative performance of the displays of four Australian lizard species in the habitats of each species under varying environmental conditions. Our simulations show that habitats differentially affect signal performance, and an interaction between display and habitat structure. Interestingly, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the signal adapted to the noisier environment does not show an advantage in signal effectiveness, but the noisy habitat was detrimental to the performance of all displays. Our study is one of the first studies for movement-based signals that directly compares signal performance in multiple habitats, and our approach has laid the foundation for future investigations in motion ecology that have been intractable to conventional research methods.","Bian, Xue; Pinilla, Angela; Chandler, Tom; Peters, Richard",Sci Rep,382,32

This paper presents a review of the structures and compositions of N95 respirators and medical face masks, their properties, and regulatory standards. It also reviews the use of cellulose and nanocellulose materials for mask manufacturing, along with other (nano)materials and composites that can add antimicrobial functionality to the material. A discussion of the most recent technologies providing antimicrobial properties to protective masks (by the introduction of natural bioactive compounds, metal-containing materials, metal-organic frameworks, inorganic salts, synthetic polymers, and carbon-based 2D nanomaterials) is presented. This review demonstrates that cellulose can be a solution for producing biodegradable masks from local resources in response to the high demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic and for producing antimicrobial filters to provide greater protection to the wearer and the environment, reducing crosscontamination risks during use and handling, and environmental concerns regarding disposal after use.","Garcia, R.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in February 2020 in three hospitals in China. The Post-traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) was used to investigate the PTG of frontline nurses. Data on related factors, including demographic characteristics and subjective variables, were collected. The Event-Related Rumination Inventory was used to assess rumination. Pearson's or Spearman's correlation was calculated for bivariate analysis. Independent sample t-tests or one-way analysis of variance and multiple linear regression analysis were used to examine the related factors. RESULTS: A total of 179 frontline nurses were recruited, and 167 were included in the analyses. The mean PTG score was 70.53±17.26. The bivariate analyses showed that deliberate rumination was modestly positively correlated with PTG (r=0.557, p<0.01), while intrusive rumination had a modest negative correlation with PTG (r=-0.413, p<0.01). Multiple linear regression demonstrated that working years, self-confidence in frontline work, awareness of risk, psychological intervention or training during the epidemic and deliberate rumination were the main influencing factors of PTG among frontline nurses and accounted for 42.5% of the variance (F=31.626, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The PTG of frontline nurses was at a medium to high level and was influenced by working years, self-confidence in frontline work, awareness of risk, psychological intervention or training and deliberate rumination. It is necessary to strengthen psychological guidance and training for frontline nurses and promote their deliberate rumination on epidemic events to improve their PTG.","Cui, Pan Pan; Wang, Pan Pan; Wang, Kun; Ping, Zhiguang; Wang, Peng; Chen, Changying",Occup. environ. med,382,24

Early reports that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was detectable in wastewater in advance of confirmed cases sparked widespread interest in wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as a tool for mitigation of COVID-19 outbreaks. One hypothesis was that wastewater surveillance might provide a cost-effective alternative to other more expensive approaches such as pooled and random testing of groups. In this paper, we report the outcomes of a wastewater surveillance pilot program at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, a large urban university with a substantial population of students living in on-campus dormitories. Surveillance was conducted at the building level on a thrice-weekly schedule throughout the university's fall residential semester. In multiple cases, wastewater surveillance enabled the identification of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases that were not detected by other components of the campus monitoring program, which also included in-house contact tracing, symptomatic testing, scheduled testing of student athletes, and daily symptom reporting. In the context of all cluster events reported to the University community during the fall semester, wastewater-based testing events resulted in the identification of smaller clusters than were reported in other types of cluster events. Wastewater surveillance was able to detect single asymptomatic individuals in dorms with resident populations of 150-200. While the strategy described was developed for COVID-19, it is likely to be applicable to mitigation of future pandemics in universities and other group-living environments.","Gibas, Cynthia; Lambirth, Kevin; Mittal, Neha; Juel, Md Ariful Islam; Barua, Visva Bharati; Roppolo Brazell, Lauren; Hinton, Keshawn; Lontai, Jordan; Stark, Nicholas; Young, Isaiah; Quach, Cristine; Russ, Morgan; Kauer, Jacob; Nicolosi, Bridgette; Chen, Don; Akella, Srinivas; Tang, Wenwu; Schlueter, Jessica; Munir, Mariya",Sci Total Environ,382,16

The mean maternal age (35.6 vs. 29.4 years; p = .002) and diagnosis of chronic hypertension (20.0% vs. 0%, p = .034) were significantly higher in the ARDS group. There was no significant difference between the two groups in their presenting symptoms. The ARDS group had a significantly higher prevalence of tachypnea (66.6% vs. 10.3%, p = .042) and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) <93% (66.6% vs. 10.3%, p = .004) at presentation. Relative lymphopenia (lymphocyte ratio < 10.5%, 66.6% vs. 17.2%, p = .002), lymphocytes to leukocytes ratio (11.3% vs. 17.7%, p = .010), and neutrophils to lymphocytes ratio (NLR) >7.5 were significantly different between the two groups (all p < .05). CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that symptom-based strategies for identifying the critically ill pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 are insufficient; however, vital signs and laboratory data might be helpful to predict ARDS in critically ill COVID-19 pregnant patients.","Kazemi Aski, Soudabeh; Norooznezhad, Amir Hossein; Shamshirsaz, Amir A; Mostafaei, Shayan; Aleyasin, Ashraf; Nabavian, Seyedeh Maedeh; Alimohammadi, Shohreh; Ahangari, Roghaye; Ariana, Shideh; Ghotbizadeh, Fahimeh; Tara, Fatemeh; Pooransari, Parichehr; Gharib Laki, Mahboobeh; Zarean, Elaheh; Soleimani, Zahra; Saliminia, Alireza; Havaei, Arash; Akbari, Razieh; Ramezani, Masoud; Soleimani, Azam; Naemi, Mahsa; Shamshirsaz, Alireza A; Hantoushzadeh, Sedigheh",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,382,29

OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the organisation and the characteristics of consultations in Belgian out-of-hours primary care during five weekends at the peak of a COVID-19 outbreak and compares it to a similar period in 2019. METHODS: Real-time observational study using pseudonymised routine clinical data extracted out of reports from home visits, telephone- and physical consultations (iCAREdata). Nine general practice cooperatives (GPCs) participated covering a population of 1 513 523. RESULTS: All GPCs rapidly re-organised care in order to handle the outbreak and provide a safe working environment. The average consultation rate was 222 per 100 000 citizens per weekend. These consultations were handled by telephone alone in 40% (N = 6293). A diagnosis at risk of COVID-19 was registered in 6692 (43%) consultations,. Out of 5311 physical consultations, 1460 were at risk of COVID-19 of which 443 (30%) did not receive prior telephone consultation to estimate this risk. Compared to 2019, the workload initially increased due to telephone consultations but afterwards declined drastically. The physical consultation rate declined by 45% with a marked decline in diagnoses unrelated to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: General practitioners can rapidly re-organise out-of-hours care to handle patient flows during a COVID-19 outbreak. Forty percent of the out-of-hours primary care contacts are handled by telephone consultations alone. We recommend to give a telephone consultation to all patients and not to rely on call takers to differentiate between infectious and regular care. The demand for physical consultations declined drastically provoking questions about patient's safety for care unrelated to COVID-19.","Morreel, Stefan; Philips, Hilde; Verhoeven, Veronique",PLoS One,382,1

COVID-19 and associated changes may have an impact on the psychosocial functioning of patients with cancer and survivors. This study was designed to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on young people living with and beyond cancer. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 177 individuals, aged 18 to 39 years, were surveyed about the impact of COVID-19 on their cancer care and psychological well-being. Participants also reported their information needs with respect to COVID-19. Responses were summarized with a content analysis approach. RESULTS: This was the first study to examine the psychological functioning of young patients and survivors during the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. A third of the respondents reported increased levels of psychological distress, and as many as 60% reported feeling more anxious than they did before COVID-19. More than half also wanted more information tailored to them as young patients with cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly evolving and changing the landscape of cancer care. Young people living with cancer are a unique population and might be more vulnerable during this time in comparison with their healthy peers. There is a need to screen for psychological distress and attend to young people whose cancer care has been delayed. As the lockdown begins to ease, the guidelines about cancer care should be updated according to this population's needs.","Kosir, Urska; Loades, Maria; Wild, Jennifer; Wiedemann, Milan; Krajnc, Alen; Roskar, Sanja; Bowes, Lucy",Cancer,382,16

Regression analysis correlated presence of ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism to COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Furthermore, COVID-19 prevalence correlated to allele frequency of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) deletion (D) polymorphism within the European population. OBJECTIVE: Homozygous ACE deletion polymorphism is associated with increase in ACE and angiotensin II (Ang-II), sustained levels can result in inflammation, fibrosis and organ damage. The ACE DD polymorphism is also associated with hypertension, acute respiratory distress and diabetic nephropathy, all considered high risk for COVID-19 infection and outcomes. The study objective was to describe a biological framework associating ethnic prevalence of ACE deletion polymorphism to COVID-19 comorbidities providing rationale for therapeutic utility of ACE-I/ARBs to improve outcomes. METHOD AND RESULTS: The Allele Frequency Database (ALFRED) was queried for frequency of rs4646994 representing ACE I/D polymorphism. In a total of 349 worldwide population samples, frequency of ACE D allele was higher in European, Asian, and Africans cohorts. In the USA, the frequency of ACE D allele was higher in non-Hispanic Black compared with non-Hispanic White and Mexican Americans. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 binding mediated reduction/inactivation of ACE-II can increase ACE/Ang-II signalling pathway and related pathologies. The presence of ACE DD polymorphism with COVID-19 infection likely augments ACE/Ang-II activities, increasing severity of COVID-19 morbidities and impacts outcomes. Thus, ethnic prevalence of ACE DD polymorphism can explain in part the severity of COVID-19 morbidity providing rationale for the use of ACE-I/ARBs to improve outcomes.","Sarangarajan, Rangaprasad; Winn, Robert; Kiebish, Michael A; Bountra, Chas; Granger, Elder; Narain, Niven R",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),382,24

In Brazil, however, this is not the case for most medical schools, considering Brazilian social inequality and uneven access to technology. Recently, the Covid-19 pandemic has also challenged Universities to seek and make a transition toward more effective methods of full-time online education. Thus, the main goal of this work was to verify student's perception and academic performance, assessed upon VM implementation in a Brazilian Medical School. Ribeirao Preto Medical School students answered a 26-question survey with regards to optical microscopy (OM) and VM. Academic performance was compared between participants that were (year of 2019) or were not (year of 2015) exposed to VM. Taken the results together, subjective impressions such as handling, suitability, learning effectiveness, and pleasure using the tools, have shown a higher score for virtual microscopy (median = 29), when compared to optical microscopy (median = 24) with a P-value < 0.001 by Wilcoxon rank test, upon measurement using an ordinal scale. Regarding academic performance, no statistically significant differences were found between groups (P-value = 0.38, Cohen's d = 0.19).

Pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemotactic factors increase insulin resistance in obesity. Therefore, a greater systemic inflammatory response is establishe, along with an increased risk of thrombotic phenomena and hyperglycemic conditions.

A national decline in procedures performed by hospitalists has prompted questions about their procedural competency. Additionally, though simulation-based mastery learning (SBML) has been shown to be effective among trainees whether this approach has enduring benefits for independent practitioners who already have experience is unknown. We aimed to assess the baseline procedural skill of hospitalists already credentialed to perform procedures. We hypothesised that simulation-based training of hospitalists would result in durable skill gains after several months. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study with pretraining and post-training measurements. SETTING: Single, large, urban academic medical centre in the USA. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-two out of 38 eligible participants defined as hospitalists working on teaching services where they would supervise trainees performing procedures. INTERVENTIONS: One-on-one, 60 min SBML of lumbar puncture (LP) and abdominal paracentesis (AP). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Our primary outcome was the percentage of hospitalists obtaining minimum passing scores (MPS) on LP and AP checklists; our secondary outcomes were average checklist scores and self-reported confidence. RESULTS: At baseline, only 16% hospitalists met or exceeded the MPS for LP and 32% for AP. Immediately after SBML, 100% of hospitalists reached this threshold. Reassessment an average of 7 months later revealed that only 40% of hospitalists achieved the MPS. Confidence increased initially after training but declined over time. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalists may be performing invasive bedside procedures without demonstration of adequate skill. A single evidence-based training intervention was insufficient to sustain skills for the majority of hospitalists over a short period of time.

For the case in which the test returns a false result with finite probability, we propose Bayesian inference and a corresponding belief propagation (BP) algorithm to identify the infected patients from the results of tests performed on the pool. We show that the true-positive rate is improved by taking into account the credible interval of a point estimate of each patient. Further, the prevalence and the error probability in the test are estimated by combining an expectation-maximization method with the BP algorithm. As another approach, we introduce a hierarchical Bayes model to identify the infected patients and estimate the prevalence.

[Turkish],15.875593,5.7057467,2020,"BACKGROUND: Information and communication technology are playing a major role in ensuring continuity of healthcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has also disrupted healthcare quality improvement (QI) training and education for healthcare professionals and there is a need to rethink the way QI training and education is delivered. The purpose of this rapid evidence review is to quickly, but comprehensively collate studies to identify what works and what does not in delivering QI training and education using distance learning modalities. METHODS: Three healthcare databases were searched along with grey literature sources for studies published between 2015 and 2020. Studies with QI training programmes or courses targeting healthcare professionals and students with at least one component of the programme being delivered online were included. RESULTS: A total of 19 studies were included in the review. Most studies had a mixed methods design and used blended learning methods, combining online and in-person delivery modes. Most of the included studies reported achieving desired outcomes, including improved QI knowledge, skills and attitudes of participants and improved clinical outcomes for patients. Some benefits of online QI training delivery include fewer required resources, reduced need for on-site instructors, increased programme reach, and more control and flexibility over learning time for participants. Some limitations of online delivery modes include limited learning and networking opportunities, functional and technical problems and long lead time for content adaptation and customisation. DISCUSSION: The review highlights that distance learning approaches to QI help in overcoming barriers to traditional QI training. Some important considerations for those looking to adapt traditional programmes to virtual environments include balancing virtual and non-virtual methods, using suitable technological solutions, customising coaching support, and using multiple criteria for programme evaluation. CONCLUSION: Virtual QI and training of healthcare professionals and students is a viable, efficient, and effective alternative to traditional QI education that will play a vital role in building their competence and confidence to improve the healthcare system in post-COVID environment.","Khurshid, Zuneera; De Brún, Aoife; Moore, Gemma; McAuliffe, Eilish",Hum Resour Health,382,20

MAIN ARGUMENT Chinese leaders have promoted 5G ICT as a component of both the Belt and Road Initiative and Military-Civil Fusion-efforts intended to extend China's influence around the world for national, commercial, and military advantage. Under Chinese law, 5G ICT firms like Huawei and ZTE are required to grant Chinese authorities access to any data that touches their systems. In response, the U.S. and Japan should consider working to counter the advantages of Chinese firms by cutting off their access to key markets, technology inputs, talent, and capital (""tripping the competition"");build up free-world alternatives (""running faster"");and restructure the global playing field to protect privacy, economic competition, and national security (""putting the fix in""). POLICY IMPLICATIONS * To reduce Chinese firms' market access, the U.S. and Japan have focused on expelling untrustworthy Chinese 5G technology from their ICT markets, tightening foreign investment review processes, enhancing visa screening and working with universities to counter Chinese intellectual property theft and talent recruitment, and ensuring that Chinese 5G firms are unable to draw on allied capital markets to fund their expansion. * To provide alternatives to Chinese 5G ICT, Washington and Tokyo are actively investing in secure and resilient 5G technologies and using these as a bridge to 6G solutions, while leveraging export promotion and development finance tools to help these technologies spread in third-country markets. * To balance privacy, economic competition, and national security, the U.S. and Japan can promote Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) and virtualized core technology solutions to restructure wireless markets, while also working with partners to advocate for data privacy norms embodied in international standard-setting institutions.","Harold, Scott W.; Kamijima-Tsunoda, Rika",Asia Policy,382,5

Teleneurology is an effective tool for the remote evaluation of patients but its adoption for frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTD) is in a preliminary stage. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated multidisciplinary assessment of patients with FTD using telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: All patients received a diagnosis of FTD during 2018-2019 according to international criteria. A structured questionnaire and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR)-FTD were used by the neurologist with patients and/or caregivers. Index symptoms of COVID-19 infection were searched. RESULTS: Twenty-eight clinical interviews were completed with caregivers and four with both patients/caregivers. Most patients and caregivers were satisfied with the neurological interview and expressed their willingness to continue to be included in remote evaluation programs (90%). Fifty percent of patients experienced significant worsening of clinical picture and quality of life since the start of social distancing. The CDR-FTD scale revealed a significant worsening of behavior (pâ=â0.01) and language functions (pâ=â0.009), compared to the last in-person evaluation at the center. One patient presented index symptoms of COVID-19 infection and was confirmed to be positive for COVID-19 with pharyngeal swab. CONCLUSION: The study was conducted in Italy, one of the countries hit particularly hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, with interruption of all non-emergency medical services. Our study indicates that telemedicine is a valid tool to triage patients with FTD to increase practice outreach and efficiency.","Capozzo, Rosa; Zoccolella, Stefano; Frisullo, Maria Elisa; Barone, Roberta; Dell039,; Abate, Maria Teresa; Barulli, Maria Rosaria; Musio, Marco; Accogli, Miriam; Logroscino, Giancarlo",J Alzheimers Dis,382,26

The purpose of this article is to highlight student perspectives of learning with portable devices to inform the use of portable technology in the Canadian school system going forward. To gather student perceptions, the research team surveyed 704 students in Grades 6 to 9 about their use of iPads in the classroom during a 1:1 technology initiative. While students were enthusiastic about the presence of portable technology, they also shared mixed feelings about the use of such technology as a learning tool. Key themes fell into three categories--engagement, inclusivity, and learning--as students shared their insight into the academic, social, and physical barriers that exist as a result of the technology. In the discussion, we identify lessons learned, especially in the area of self-regulation, and make recommendations on how to harness the power of this multi-faceted learning tool and minimize the chaos it can create when not utilized deliberately and carefully.","Ge, Jenny Smyth Rachael E.; Searle, Michelle Kirkpatrick Lori Evans Rebecca Elder Alexa Brown Heather",Brock Education: A Journal of Educational Research and Practice,382,16

However, their efficiency heavily relies on the pixel-level annotations that are expensive to get and often require domain expertise, especially in medical imaging. Weakly supervised semantic segmentation helps to overcome these issues and also provides explainable deep learning models. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the semantic segmentation of medical chest X-ray images with only image-level class labels as supervision. We improve the disease localization accuracy by combining three approaches as consecutive steps. First, we generate pseudo segmentation labels of abnormal regions in the training images through a supervised classification model enhanced with a regularization procedure. The obtained activation maps are then post-processed and propagated into a second classification model-Inter-pixel Relation Network, which improves the boundaries between different object classes. Finally, the resulting pseudo-labels are used to train a proposed fully supervised segmentation model. We analyze the robustness of the presented method and test its performance on two distinct datasets: PASCAL VOC 2012 and SIIM-ACR Pneumothorax. We achieve significant results in the segmentation on both datasets using only image-level annotations. We show that this approach is applicable to chest X-rays for detecting an anomalous volume of air in the pleural space between the lung and the chest wall.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 500 initial CXR from COVID-19-suspected patients. Each CXR was scored based on geographic extent and degree of opacity as indicators of disease severity. COVID-19 status and clinical outcomes including intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, mortality, length of hospitalisation, and duration on ventilator were collected. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between CXR scores and COVID-19 status, CXR scores and clinical outcomes, adjusted for code status, age, gender and co-morbidities. RESULTS: The interclass correlation coefficients amongst raters were 0.94 and 0.90 for the extent score and opacity score, respectively. CXR scores were significantly (p < 0.01) associated with COVID-19 positivity (odd ratio [OR] = 1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.27 - 1.75 for extent score and OR = 1.75; 95% CI: 1.42 - 2.15 for opacity score), ICU admission (OR = 1.19; 95% CI: 1.09 - 1.31 for extent score and OR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.10 - 1.44 for opacity score), and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR = 1.22; 95% CI: 1.11 - 1.35 for geographic score and OR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.05 - 1.38 for opacity score).

Given the significant global demand to provide telehealth services, it is important to explore patient receptiveness toward this alternative service model, particularly from regions where it has yet to be implemented. We conducted a cross-sectional study to understand the views and willingness of patients toward the use of telehealth for cancer genetic counseling. A survey was completed by 160 patients of the National Cancer Centre Singapore, and descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. The study found that 95.6% (n = 153/160) of participants did not have prior telehealth experience. Most participants were willing or neutral toward having genetic counseling by phone (n = 114/160, 71.3%) and video (n = 106/160, 66.3%). However, majority prefer in-person appointments for first (n = 127/160, 79.4%) and follow-up (n = 97/160, 60.6%) visits over telehealth. Majority agreed that a phone/video consultation would meet most of their needs but voiced concerns regarding privacy and sharing of information (n = 79/160, 49.4% for phone; n = 74/160, 46.3% for video) and whether their emotional needs could be met (n = 61/160, 38.1%). Participants' age, employment status, income, mode of transportation to the appointment, and whether special arrangements were made to attend the in-person appointment were associated with receptivity to telehealth genetic counseling (p &#8804; .05 for all). This study adds diversity to existing literature and demonstrates that patients from Asia are generally willing and accepting of the use of telehealth in a cancer genetics service. This will help meet increasing global demand of telehealth consultations in the post-pandemic new norm. Furthermore, it will also provide services for underserved populations and patients requiring urgent testing in a timely manner. Further studies are needed to explore the cost-effectiveness and fair billing methods, as well as willingness and acceptability of telehealth genetic counseling in post-COVID times.","Sim, Jackie; Shaw, Tarryn; Li, Shao-Tzu; Courtney, Eliza; Yuen, Jeanette; Chiang, Jianbang; Nazir, Maryam; Tan, Ryan; Ngeow, Joanne",J. genet. couns,382,10

Methods: Forty hospitalized patients that tested positive for SARS-CoV2 with the RT-PCR test were evaluated. They were randomly divided into experimental (n=20; gargling with 1% H2O2 and nasal wash with 0.5% H2O2) or control group (n=20). The solutions were used for seven days and the patients were monitored every two days, for eight days. During the control, patients were asked about their symptoms and possible adverse effects of the solutions. The presence and severity (mild, moderate or severe) of the symptoms were recorded. Data were compared using the Student's test and Fischer's exact test (&#945;=0.05). Results: There was no difference between the two groups for the length of hospital stay (p=0.65). The most frequent symptom on day 0 was coughing (72% for experimental and 76.5% for control), which abated over time. There was no difference between the groups for the evaluated symptoms. 75% of the experimental group patients presented a decrease of the symptom ""difficulty breathing"" between days 0 and 2. Few patients reported adverse effects with the use of solutions. Conclusion: H2O2 as a mouthwash and nasal spray is safe to be used. There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that H2O2 is effective as an auxiliary treatment for Covid-19 hospitalized patients.","Di Domênico, Marielle Bazzo; Cesca, Henrique; Ponciano, Thales Henrique Jincziwski; Dos Santos, Renan Brandenburg; Lenz, Ulysses; Antunes, Vinícius Picoli; Godinho, Vinicius Webber; Collares, Kauê; Corazza, Pedro Henrique",Epidemiol Health,382,30

The primary aim of the UIH/MSHC testing project was to increase testing capacity in the most affected, racial/ethnic minority communities. More than 7,500 tests were performed over a six-month period. Half of those who were tested were Black and Latinx residents. The majority of those tested at the Walk-Up sites were Black, while ""Other"" race group tended to get tested in Drive Thru testing sites. Latinx residents had the highest positivity rate, followed by Other race group. Younger age groups were more likely to have higher positivity rates. Overall, UH/MSHC testing results reflected the overall Chicago COVID-19 testing results. Our findings substantiate the need to advocate for equitable resource allocation to counter the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 infection among minority communities. FQHCs were shown to be an effective approach to reduce structural barriers to COVID-19 testing and subsequently reduce disparities. Going forward, FQHCs can be key to ensuring COVID-19 vaccine outreach and dissemination.","Kim, S. J.; Watson, K.; Khare, N.; Shastri, S.; Da Goia Pinto, C. L.; Nazir, N.

Volatile organic compounds produced during respiratory infections can cause specific scent imprints, which can be detected by trained dogs with a high rate of precision. METHODS: Eight detection dogs were trained for 1 week to detect saliva or tracheobronchial secretions of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in a randomised, double-blinded and controlled study. RESULTS: The dogs were able to discriminate between samples of infected (positive) and non-infected (negative) individuals with average diagnostic sensitivity of 82.63% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 82.02-83.24%) and specificity of 96.35% (95% CI: 96.31-96.39%). During the presentation of 1012 randomised samples, the dogs achieved an overall average detection rate of 94% (±3.4%) with 157 correct indications of positive, 792 correct rejections of negative, 33 incorrect indications of negative or incorrect rejections of 30 positive sample presentations. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings indicate that trained detection dogs can identify respiratory secretion samples from hospitalised and clinically diseased SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals by discriminating between samples from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and negative controls. This data may form the basis for the reliable screening method of SARS-CoV-2 infected people.","Jendrny, Paula; Schulz, Claudia; Twele, Friederike; Meller, Sebastian; von Köckritz-Blickwede, Maren; Osterhaus, Albertus Dominicus Marcellinus Erasmus; Ebbers, Janek; Pilchová, Veronika; Pink, Isabell; Welte, Tobias; Manns, Michael Peter; Fathi, Anahita; Ernst, Christiane; Addo, Marylyn Martina; Schalke, Esther; Volk, Holger Andreas",BMC Infect Dis,382,24

The major roles of the protein include virulence, infectivity, ion channel activity, morphogenesis, and virus release. The coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 is mutating rapidly, therefore, critical study of mutations in ORF3a is certainty important from the pathogenetic perspective. Here, a sum of 175 various non-synonymous mutations in the ORF3a protein of SARS-CoV-2 were identified in 7194 complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 available in the NCBI database, and their corresponding effects in structural stability, and functions of ORF3a were studied. Broadly three different classes of mutations, such as neutral, disease, and mixed (neutral and disease) type mutations were observed. Consecutive mutations in ORF3a proteins are established based on the timeline of detection of mutations. Considering the amino acid compositions over the ORF3a primary protein sequences, twenty clusters were detected using the K-means clustering method. The present findings on 175 novel mutations of ORF3a proteins will extend our knowledge of ORF3a, a vital accessory protein in SARS-CoV-2, to enlighten on the pathogenicity of this life-threatening COVID-19.","Hassan, Sk Sarif; Attrish, Diksha; Ghosh, Shinjini; Choudhury, Pabitra Pal; Roy, Bidyut",Virus Res,382,5

The clinical characteristics, underlying stroke mechanism, and outcomes in this particular subset of patients are especially salient as therapeutic anticoagulation becomes increasingly common in the treatment and prevention of thrombotic complications of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with hemorrhagic stroke (both non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage and spontaneous non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage) who were hospitalized between March 1, 2020, and May 15, 2020, within a major healthcare system in New York, during the coronavirus pandemic. Patients with hemorrhagic stroke on admission and who developed hemorrhage during hospitalization were both included. We compared the clinical characteristics of patients with hemorrhagic stroke and COVID-19 to those without COVID-19 admitted to our hospital system between March 1, 2020, and May 15, 2020 (contemporary controls), and March 1, 2019, and May 15, 2019 (historical controls). Demographic variables and clinical characteristics between the individual groups were compared using Fischer's exact test for categorical variables and nonparametric test for continuous variables. We adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method. RESULTS: During the study period in 2020, out of 4071 patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19, we identified 19 (0.5%) with hemorrhagic stroke. Of all COVID-19 with hemorrhagic stroke, only three had isolated non-aneurysmal SAH with no associated intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Among hemorrhagic stroke in patients with COVID-19, coagulopathy was the most common etiology (73.7%); empiric anticoagulation was started in 89.5% of these patients versus 4.2% in contemporary controls (p &#8804; .001) and 10.0% in historical controls (p &#8804; .001). Compared to contemporary and historical controls, patients with COVID-19 had higher initial NIHSS scores, INR, PTT, and fibrinogen levels. Patients with COVID-19 also had higher rates of in-hospital mortality (84.6% vs. 4.6%, p &#8804; 0.001). Sensitivity analyses excluding patients with strictly subarachnoid hemorrhage yielded similar results. CONCLUSION: We observed an overall low rate of imaging-confirmed hemorrhagic stroke among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Most hemorrhages in patients with COVID-19 infection occurred in the setting of therapeutic anticoagulation and were associated with increased mortality. Further studies are needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of therapeutic anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19.","Kvernland, Alexandra; Kumar, Arooshi; Yaghi, Shadi; Raz, Eytan; Frontera, Jennifer; Lewis, Ariane; Czeisler, Barry; Kahn, D Ethan; Zhou, Ting; Ishida, Koto; Torres, Jose; Riina, Howard A; Shapiro, Maksim; Nossek, Erez; Nelson, Peter K; Tanweer, Omar; Gordon, David; Jain, Rajan; Dehkharghani, Seena; Henninger, Nils; de Havenon, Adam; Grory, Brian Mac; Lord, Aaron; Melmed, Kara",Neurocritical care,382,6

Where the media places responsibility during a pandemic is therefore important to study as blame is commonly used as a tool to influence public behavior but can also lead to the subjective persecution of groups. The aim of this paper is to investigate where the media places responsibility for COVID-19 in Australia. Specifically, we identify the key themes and frames that are present and observe how they changed over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to government actions and progression of the pandemic. Understanding media representations of the COVID-19 pandemic will provide insights into ways in which responsibility is framed in relation to health action. Newspaper articles from the Australian and the Sydney Morning Herald were sampled between January 20 and March 31 2020 on every second Monday. Factiva was used to identify and download newspaper articles using the following search criteria: “COVID-19” OR coronavirus OR “Wuhan virus” OR “corona virus” OR “Hebei virus” OR “wet market” OR (Wuhan AND virus) OR (market AND Wuhan and virus) or (China AND Virus) or (Novel AND Virus). Articles were imported into Nvivo and thematic and framing analyses were used. The results show that framing of the pandemic was largely based on societal issues with the theme of economic disruption prevalent throughout the study time period. Moral evaluations of the pandemic were infrequent initially but increased co-incident with the first signs of “flattening of the curve.” Explicit examples of blame were very rare but were commonly implied based on the causal origin of the virus. The Australian printed media were slow to report on the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition they were reluctant to apportion blame until the end of the study period, after confirmed case rates had begun to slow. This is interpreted as being due to an evaluation of the pandemic risks as low by the media and therefore the tools of othering and blame were not used until after the study period when the actual risks had begun to abate, more consistent with an inquiry than a mediating mechanism.","Thomas, Trevor; Wilson, Annabelle; Tonkin, Emma; Miller, Emma R.; Ward, Paul R.",Front.

In addition, frontline workers deemed essential to meet our basic needs have faced enormous personal risk to keep earning their paychecks and the economy running. Immigrant communities face an intersection of all three vulnerabilities (e.g., economic precarity, health care barriers, essential workforce), making them one of the most vulnerable populations in the United States. We conducted 26 interviews via Zoom with immigrant service providers in Pennsylvania and New York, including lawyers, case workers, religious leaders, advocates, doctors, and educators in order to gain a better understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on immigrant communities. These interviews affirmed that immigrants are concentrated in essential industries, which increases their exposure to the virus. In addition, they lack access to social safety nets when trying to access health care or facing job/income loss. Last, COVID-19 did not adequately slow the detention and deportation machine in the United States, which led to increased transmission of the virus among not only detainees but also others in the detention system, surrounding communities, and the countries to which people were deported, countries that often lacked an adequate infrastructure for dealing with the pandemic.Based on our interviews, we have a series of specific policy recommendations to diminish the vulnerability of immigrants and create social safety nets that will include them and protect them when the market fails to do so. Immigrants of all types have made indispensable contributions to the US economy during the pandemic and before it. First, Congress and states should pass legislation to provide COVID-19 relief payments to all essential workers, regardless of their status, as compensation for putting their lives on the line to keep the economy running. Second, as a public health imperative, federal and state governments should expand coverage of Medicaid and Children?s Health Insurance Programs (CHIP) to include immigrant essential workers and their children, regardless of their status. Third, DHS should not refer essential workers to removal proceedings, and immigration courts should terminate all removal proceedings for essential workers without criminal records. When it comes to issues of health care affordability and access, Congress must continue to revise the Affordable Healthcare Act to expand coverage for those who do not qualify for Medicaid but earn too little to afford insurance on their own. Finally, there must be a review and rigorous enforcement of workplace health and safety standards, particularly when it comes to farming, meatpacking, food production, and food service industries.Our final recommendations are specific to DHS and two of the primary agencies they oversee: Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Border Patrol. First, there needs to be a review of ICE policies and practices, leading to a shift in policy that keeps mixed-status families intact and minor children out of detention centers and that streamlines and expands the asylum process. Second, both Congress and the administration must create additional paths to legal status where none now exist, including for recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and for children who have arrived since June 2007.","Kiester, Elizabeth Vasquez-Merino Jennifer",Journal on Migration and Human Security,382,21

METHODS: We apply a systematic and persuasive approach to reveal the underlying dynamical features of this variant. The approach utilises extracting the main features, which consist of 3-valued features, via the time-series data for new cases, 28-day deaths and 60-day deaths. The experimental samples chosen rely on the the rolling sets of regional data vectors whose dimensions are all 7 days. These data sets are projected onto the 3-valued features to yield the vector rejections. Then the minimal features are thus extracted by the minimal total norms. Then we map out the traces of the similarities between all the extracted time-varying features. RESULTS: Our findings, no matter in preliminary or follow-up study, clearly show there is no consistent and substantial shift in the 3-valued features even after the occurrence of this new variant - this might validate the efficacy of the current vaccines against this variant. CONCLUSIONS: Since the underlying features of the mutant is unchanged, and the leading feature of B1.1.7 is not yet present, it might help us make the lockdown decision ""choose the lesser of the two evils: pandemic and economic woes"", and validate vaccine developments or adopt preventive measures.","Chen, Ray-Ming",Math Biosci Eng,382,21

Stroke has increasingly been reported as a complication of COVID-19 infection. However, a systematic synthesis of the available data has not been conducted. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of currently available epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data related to both stroke and COVID-19 infection. Methods: We systematically searched Medline, Cinahl, and PubMed for studies related to stroke and COVID-19 from inception up to June 4, 2020. We selected cohort studies, case series, and case reports that reported the occurrence of stroke in COVID-19 patients. A fixed-effects model was used to estimate the pooled frequency of stroke in COVID-19 patients with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Twenty-eight studies were included in the systematic review and seven studies for the meta-analysis. The pooled frequency of stroke in COVID-19 patients was 1.1% (95% CI: 0.8, 1.3). The heterogeneity was low (I(2) = 0.0%). Even though the frequency of stroke among patients having COVID-19 infection was low, those with concomitant COVID-19 infection and stroke suffered from a more severe infection and eventually had a poorer prognosis with a higher mortality rate (46.7%) than COVID-19 alone. Many COVID-19 patients shared the common traditional risk factors for stroke. We noted that ischemic stroke involving the anterior circulation with large vessels occlusion is the most common type of stroke with more strokes seen in multi-territorial regions, suggesting systemic thromboembolism. An elevated level of D-dimers, C-reactive protein, ferritin, lactic acid dehydrogenase, troponin, ESR, fibrinogen, and a positive antiphospholipid antibody were also noted in this review. Conclusions: The occurrence of stroke in patients with COVID-19 infection is uncommon, but it may pose as an important prognostic marker and indicator of severity of infection, by causing large vessels occlusion and exhibiting a thrombo-inflammatory vascular picture. Physicians should be made aware and remain vigilant on the possible two-way relationship between stroke and COVID-19 infection. The rate of stroke among patients with COVID-19 infection may increase in the future as they share the common risk factors.","Lee, Kai Wei; Yusof Khan, Abdul Hanif Khan; Ching, Siew Mooi; Chia, Peck Kee; Loh, Wei Chao; Abdul Rashid, Anna Misya'il; Baharin, Janudin; Inche Mat, Liyana Najwa; Wan Sulaiman, Wan Aliaa; Devaraj, Navin Kumar; Sivaratnam, Dhashani; Basri, Hamidon; Hoo, Fan Kee",Front Neurol,382,16

The aim is to evaluate the accuracy of the nasal acoustic device (NAD) in diagnosing the common causes for nasal obstruction and diagnosing normal and abnormal (nasal obstruction) nasal breathing. METHODS: This pilot study recruited 27 patients with allergic rhinitis (AR), chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), and a deviated nasal septum (DNS) which represents the common causes for NO and 26 controls (with normal nasal breathing). Nasal breathing sounds were recorded by the NAD akin to two small stethoscopes placed over the left and right nasal ala. The novel outcome metrics for the NAD include inspiratory nasal acoustic score (INA) score, expiratory nasal acoustic (ENA) score and the inspiratory nasal obstruction balance index (NOBI). The change in acoustic score following decongestant is key in this diagnostic process. RESULTS: Pre‐decongestant ENA score was used to detect the presence of nasal obstruction in patients compared to controls, with a sensitivity of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.66‐0.96) and a specificity of 0.77 (0.54‐1.00). Post‐decongestant percentage change in INA score was used to identify the presence of AR or CRS, with a sensitivity of 0.87 (0.69‐1.00) and specificity of 0.72 (0.55‐0.89) for AR; and a sensitivity of 0.92 (0.75‐1.00) and specificity of 0.69 (0.52‐0.86) for CRS. Post‐decongestant inspiratory NOBI was used to identify DNS, with a sensitivity of 0.77 (0.59‐0.95) and specificity of 0.94 (0.82‐1.00). CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that the NAD can help distinguish between normal and abnormal nasal breathing and help diagnose AR, CRS, and DNS. Such a device has not been invented and could revolutionize COVID‐19 recovery telemedicine.

In immunocompetent individuals, the infection is typically mild or asymptomatic. However, in the last years, some cases of severe cytomegalovirus infection in immunocompetent individuals have been described. Clinical Presentation. The authors present a male patient aged 42 years, without specific medical history, who presented a 15-day history of fever, headache, night sweats, odynophagia, and bilateral otalgia, without improvement after four days of therapy with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Blood count and biochemistry were performed with liver cytolysis pattern. Chest teleradiography showed diffuse interstitial infiltrate. Thoracic CT scan revealed areas in a ground glass with a cross-linking component in the left and right upper lung lobes compatible with an inflammatory/infectious process. Blood serology was positive for CMV IgG and IgM. The detection on blood and bronchoalveolar lavage of CMV DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was also positive. Ganciclovir was started based on the clinical features and the result of CMV serology. After 48 hours, there was a significant clinical improvement, with remission of fever, and he was discharged on the 13th day of hospitalization with oral valganciclovir, completing a 21-day antiviral course at home. CONCLUSION: With this clinical case, the authors highlight the importance of considering CMV infection in evaluating patients with pneumonia, even in immunocompetent ones, particularly in those with no clinical improvement with antibiotics instituted for bacterial pneumonia, and when other causes have been ruled out.","Luís, Helena; Barros, Carolina; Gomes, Mariana; Andrade, José Luís; Faria, Nancy",Case Rep Infect Dis,382,23

The supply of antiviral filters which form an essential part of the ventilator circuit have been affected by these issues. Three-dimensional (3D) printing may provide a solution to some of these issues. METHODS: We designed and tested 3D printed heat and moisture exchange (HME) and antiviral casing. For each casing we tested two different filter materials derived from a sediment water filter cartridge or 1.5-μm glass fiber filter paper. A polyurethane sponge was used for the HME. Each design was tested for circuit leak, circuit compliance, peak inspiratory pressure and casing integrity using methylene blue dye. RESULTS: We designed, produced, and tested two different types of antiviral filters with six different internal configurations. Overall, we tested 10 modified filter designs and compared them with the original commercial filter. Except for the combination of 1.5-μm filter paper and 5 mm sponge peak inspiratory pressure and circuit compliance of the filters produced were within the operating limits of the ventilator. All In addition, all filters passed the dye test. CONCLUSIONS: Our filter may be of particular importance to those working in low middle-income countries unable to compete with stronger economies. Our design relies on products available outside the healthcare supply chain, much of which can be purchased in grocery stores, hardware stores, or industrial and academic institutions. We hope that these HMEs and viral filters may be beneficial to clinicians who face critical supply chain issues during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Uncertainties exist about their effect on the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. OBJECTIVES: We sought to systematically review the literature and perform a meta-analysis to examine the association between prior statins use and outcomes of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, and the preprint server MedRxiv from inception to December 2020. We assessed the quality of eligible studies with the Newcastle-Ottawa quality scale. We pooled adjusted risk ratios (aRR) of the association between prior statins use and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 using the DerSimonian-Laird random effects model and assessed heterogeneity using the I (2)-index. RESULTS: Overall, 19 (16 cohorts and 3 case-control) studies were eligible, with a total of 395,513 patients. Sixteen of 19 studies had low- or moderate-risk of bias. Among 109,080 patients enrolled in 13 separate studies, prior statins use was associated with a lower risk of mortality, (pooled aRR 0.65 (95% CI 0.56-0.77, I (2) = 84.1%) and a reduced risk of severe COVID-19 was also observed in 48,110 patients enrolled in 9 studies, (pooled aRR of 0.73 (95% CI 0.57-0.94, I (2) = 82.8%), with no evidence of publication bias.

Many factors go into this process, including selecting the groups of professionals we will need, streamlining their licensing and credentialing processes, identifying appropriate roles for them, and supporting their health and well-being. The questions we must answer are these: How many staff will we need? How do we provide them with emergency licenses and credentials to practice? What interstate licensing compacts and registration systems exist to facilitate the process? What caveats are there to using retired healthcare professionals and healthcare students? How can we best avoid attrition among and increase the numbers of international medical graduates? Which non-clinical volunteers can we use and in what capacities? The answers to these questions will change as the crisis develops, although the earlier we address them, the smoother will be the process of using augmentees for the healthcare system.","Iserson, Kenneth V.",West J Emerg Med,382,3

Various methods have been worked out for their synthesis. Several pyrazoline derivatives have been found to possess diverse biological properties, which has stimulated research activity in this field. Areas covered: The present review sheds light on the recent therapeutic patent literature (2000 – 2011) describing the applications of pyrazolines and their derivatives on selected activities. Many of the therapeutic applications of pyrazoline derivatives have been discussed, either in the patent or in the general literature areas in this review. In addition to selected biological data, a wide range of pharmaceutical applications and pharmaceutical compositions are also summarized. Expert opinion: Pyrazoline derivatives have numerous prominent pharmacological effects, such as antimicrobial (antibacterial, antifungal, antiamoebic, antimycobacterial), anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antidepressant and anticancer. Further pharmacological effects include cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonists, antiepileptic, antitrypanosomal, antiviral activity, MAO-inhibitory, antinociceptive activity, insecticidal, hypotensive, nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, antioxidant, steroidal and antidiabetic. Lastly, they also effect ACAT inhibition, urotensin II and somatostatin-5 receptors, TGF-β signal transduction inhibitors and neurocytotoxicity inhibitors activities. Many new pyrazoline derivatives have been synthesized and patented, but there are still new aspects to explore and work on.","Shaaban, Mohamed R; Mayhoub, Abdelrahman S; Farag, Ahmad M",Expert Opin Ther Pat,382,0

We focus attention on virus transmissions in a closed population and hence use a compartmental epidemic model to study the inherent dynamics of infections between the various subgroups of the population. We assume random interactions between members from different subgroups and hence we employ stochastic modelling techniques. In the absence of a vaccine for this novel coronavirus, governments worldwide have put in place various intervention strategies, including travel bans, lockdowns, screening, testing, quarantine, etc. in order to reduce and hopefully eliminate the transmission and spread of the COVID-19 virus. These interventions are built into our model and we investigate their effects and effectiveness. In particular, we observe that the two subgroups containing infectious individuals, namely; the subgroup comprising of unidentified asymptomatic individuals as well as; the subgroup comprising of un-quarantined symptomatic individuals; pose the greatest risk of the transmission and spread of infections. We therefore also observe from our results that; rapid (realtime) mass testing as well as effective (or mandatory) quarantine of all infected individuals are the fundamentally critical and necessary steps in reducing the internal transmissions and spread of the COVID-19 virus. In particular, our results indicate that lockdowns are only important to the extent that, if implemented effectively, they help in reducing the rate of transmissions (i.e. help to ‘flatten’ the transmission curves) and hence allow policy makers and healthcare practitioners to put in place the important processes of realtime mass testing and mandatory quarantine, including hospitalization and treatment. Our results are presented over a single wave (or part of a single wave) of COVID-19 infections in a given population. If conditions are repeated, the results would correspondingly extend to multiple waves of infection.","Chinyoka, Tiri",Results Phys,382,16

This review focuses on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 in the heart after direct infection that can lead to myocarditis and an outline of potential treatment options. The main points are: (1) Viral entry: SARS-CoV-2 uses specific receptors and proteases for docking and priming in cardiac cells. Thus, different receptors or protease inhibitors might be effective in SARS-CoV-2-infected cardiac cells. (2) Viral replication: SARS-CoV-2 uses RNA-dependent RNA polymerase for replication. Drugs acting against ssRNA(+) viral replication for cardiac cells can be effective. (3) Autophagy and double-membrane vesicles: SARS-CoV-2 manipulates autophagy to inhibit viral clearance and promote SARS-CoV-2 replication by creating double-membrane vesicles as replication sites. (4) Immune response: Host immune response is manipulated to evade host cell attacks against SARS-CoV-2 and increased inflammation by dysregulating immune cells. Efficiency of immunosuppressive therapy must be elucidated. (5) Programmed cell death: SARS-CoV-2 inhibits programmed cell death in early stages and induces apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis in later stages. (6) Energy metabolism: SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to disturbed energy metabolism that in turn leads to a decrease in ATP production and ROS production. (7) Viroporins: SARS-CoV-2 creates viroporins that lead to an imbalance of ion homeostasis. This causes apoptosis, altered action potential, and arrhythmia.","Ho, Huyen Tran; Peischard, Stefan; Strutz-Seebohm, Nathalie; Klingel, Karin; Seebohm, Guiscard",Viruses,382,21

Most studies on immune response of COVID-19 have focused on the moderately or severely symptomatic patients, however little is known about the immune response in asymptomatic and re-detectable positive patients. Here we performed a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptomic profiles of PBMCs from 48 COVID-19 patients which include 8 asymptomatic, 13 symptomatic, 15 recovering and 12 RP patients. Our analysis revealed a down-regulation of IFN response and complement activation in the asymptomatic patients compared with the symptomatic, indicating a weaker immune response of the PBMCs in the asymptomatic patients. In addition, we observed a lower expression of the cytokines and chemokines in the PBMC of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. In contrast, the cytokines and chemokines level in the RP patients are higher than the recovering. GSEA analysis showed the enrichment of TNFa/NF-{kappa}B and influenza infection in the RP patients compared with the recovering patients, indicating a flu-like, hyper-inflammatory immune response in the PBMC of RP patients.

Government-imposed restrictive measures continue with undetermined effects on physical and mental health. AIMS: To compare child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) referrals over 11 months (January–November) in 2020, 2019 and 2018 and examine any impact the different phases of the COVID-19 restrictions might have on referral rates. METHOD: Monthly CAMHS Health Service Executive data were examined, covering a catchment population of 260 560 or 12.7% of all youth (age group 0–18 years) in Ireland. The total number of urgent and routine referrals, appointments offered, rates of non-attendances and discharge outcome are presented. RESULTS: There was a significant drop in referrals in 2020, compared with prior years (χ(2) = 10.3, d.f. = 2, P = 0.006). Referrals in 2020 dropped from March to May by 11% and from June to August by 10.3%. From September, both routine and urgent referrals increased by 50% compared with previous years (2018/2019), with the highest increase in November 2020 (180%). Clinic activity also increased from September, with double the number of out-patient appointments offered, compared with previous years (χ(2) = 5171.72, d.f. = 3, P < 0.001) and lower (6.6%) rates of non-attendance (χ(2) = 868.35, d.f. = 3, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In 2020, following an initial decline, referrals to CAMHS increased consistently from September. Such unprecedented increase in referrals places further strain on services that are already underresourced and underfunded, with the likelihood of increased waiting lists post COVID-19. It is envisaged that once the pandemic is over, resources will be even more constrained, and CAMHS will be urgently in need of additional ring-fenced funding.","McNicholas, Fiona; Kelleher, Ian; Hedderman, Elma; Lynch, Fionnuala; Healy, Elaine; Thornton, Therese; Barry, Edwina; Kelly, Lisa; McDonald, James; Holmes, Keith; Kavanagh, Glenda; Migone, Maria",BJPsych Open,382,16

This is a really important issue for dentistry, where we place great emphasis on infection control and universal precautions, given the nature of care provided. Cochrane have recently updated their review of PPE for preventing highly infectious diseases due to exposure to contaminated body fluids in healthcare staff. It examined evidence on which type of full body PPE and which method of donning (putting on) or doffing (removing) are most effective, while having the least risk of contamination or infection for healthcare workers, as well as which training methods increase compliance with PPE protocols. The objective of this paper is to raise awareness of the above review of PPE, its findings and their relevance to dentistry as outlined in the Cochrane Oral Health website. The available evidence comes from healthcare generally, mostly involving simulation exercises, and is of low or very low certainty. None of the evidence specifically comes from dentistry. The findings in relation to the nature of PPE, methods of donning and doffing, and the importance of training are all of practical relevance to dentistry.

METHODS Between March 2020 and December 2020, 427 patients with real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit were analysed retrospectively. Using receiver operating characteristic analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) for initial invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) variables such as initial peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), PaO2/FiO2 (P/F ratio), tidal volume, compliance and positive end-expiratory pressure was evaluated regarding PNMD development. RESULTS The incidence of PNMD was 5.6% (n = 24). PNMD development rate was 2.7% in non-invasive MV and 6.2% in MV [odds ratio (OR) 2.352, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.541-10.232; P = 0.400]. In the multivariate analysis, the independent risk factors affecting the development of PNMD were PIP (OR 1.238, 95% CI 1.091-1.378; P < 0.001) and P/F ratio (OR 0.982, 95% CI 0.971-0.994; P = 0.004). P/F ratio (AUC 0.815, 95% CI 0.771-0.854), PIP (AUC 0.780, 95% CI 0.734-0.822), compliance (AUC 0.735, 95% CI 0.677-0.774) and positive end-expiratory pressure (AUC 0.718, 95% CI 0.668-0.764) were the best predictors for PNMD development. Regarding the multivariate analysis, independent risk factors affecting mortality were detected as age (OR 1.015, 95% CI 0.999-1.031; P = 0.04), comorbidity (OR 1.940, 95% CI 1.100-3.419; P = 0.02), mode of breathing (OR 48.345, 95% CI 14.666-159.360; P < 0.001), PNMD (OR 5.234, 95% CI 1.379-19.857; P = 0.01), positive end-expiratory pressure (OR 1.305, 95% CI 1.062-1.603; P = 0.01) and tidal volume (OR 0.995, 95% CI 0.992-0.998; P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS PNMD development was associated with the initial P/F ratio and PIP. Therefore, it was considered to be related to both the patient and barotrauma. PNMD is a poor prognostic factor for COVID-19.","Özdemir, Servet; Bilgi, Deniz Özel; Hergünsel, Gülsüm Oya; Çitak, Necati",Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,382,20

Characterization of these patients may inform post-hospitalization care. OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 who returned to the emergency department (ED) or required readmission within 14 days of discharge. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of SARS-COV-2-positive patients with index hospitalization between February 27 and April 12, 2020, with ≥ 14-day follow-up. Significance was defined as P < 0.05 after multiplying P by 125 study-wide comparisons. PARTICIPANTS: Hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 discharged alive from five New York City hospitals. MAIN MEASURES: Readmission or return to ED following discharge. RESULTS: Of 2864 discharged patients, 103 (3.6%) returned for emergency care after a median of 4.5 days, with 56 requiring inpatient readmission. The most common reason for return was respiratory distress (50%). Compared with patients who did not return, there were higher proportions of COPD (6.8% vs 2.9%) and hypertension (36% vs 22.1%) among those who returned. Patients who returned also had a shorter median length of stay (LOS) during index hospitalization (4.5 [2.9,9.1] vs 6.7 [3.5, 11.5] days; P(adjusted) = 0.006), and were less likely to have required intensive care on index hospitalization (5.8% vs 19%; P(adjusted) = 0.001). A trend towards association between absence of in-hospital treatment-dose anticoagulation on index admission and return to hospital was also observed (20.9% vs 30.9%, P(adjusted) = 0.06). On readmission, rates of intensive care and death were 5.8% and 3.6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Return to hospital after admission for COVID-19 was infrequent within 14 days of discharge. The most common cause for return was respiratory distress. Patients who returned more likely had COPD and hypertension, shorter LOS on index-hospitalization, and lower rates of in-hospital treatment-dose anticoagulation. Future studies should focus on whether these comorbid conditions, longer LOS, and anticoagulation are associated with reduced readmissions.

One of the simply available imaging modalities in clinical routine involves chest X-ray (CXR), which is often used for diagnostic purposes. Here, we proposed a computer-aided detection of COVID-19 in CXR imaging using deep and conventional radiomic features. First, we used a 2D U-Net model to segment the lung lobes. Then, we extracted deep latent space radiomics by applying deep convolutional autoencoder (ConvAE) with internal dense layers to extract low-dimensional deep radiomics. We used Johnson–Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma, Laplacian scoring (LS), and principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality in conventional radiomics. The generated low-dimensional deep and conventional radiomics were integrated to classify COVID-19 from pneumonia and healthy patients. We used 704 CXR images for training the entire model (i.e., U-Net, ConvAE, and feature selection in conventional radiomics). Afterward, we independently validated the whole system using a study cohort of 1597 cases. We trained and tested a random forest model for detecting COVID-19 cases through multivariate binary-class and multiclass classification. The maximal (full multivariate) model using a combination of the two radiomic groups yields performance in classification cross-validated accuracy of 72.6% (69.4–74.4%) for multiclass and 89.6% (88.4–90.7%) for binary-class classification.","Yousefi, Bardia; Kawakita, Satoru; Amini, Arya; Akbari, Hamed; Advani, Shailesh M.; Akhloufi, Moulay; Maldague, Xavier P.

We analyzed syphilis cases by year of diagnosis, age, sex, area of residence, and transmission category.Results7,889 cases were reported in 2019, corresponding to a 7% rise compared to 2018. Incidence was 9.5/100,000 inhabitants, with highest incidences in metropolitan cities as Cologne (57.8), Berlin (39.7), and Munich (30.2). From January to June 2020, incidence dropped by 3% compared to this period in 2019.Men accounted for 94% of cases in 2019. 86% of cases with information on transmission route were men who have sex with men (MSM), 14% heterosexuals. Median age of MSM ranged between 39–41 years since 2009. HIV-coinfection was reported for 44% MSM. HIV-negative MSM were diagnosed less frequently with reinfection (27%) compared to HIV-positive MSM (66%), and more frequent during primary state of infection (34% vs 23%).ConclusionData showed a high burden of disease in MSM in metropolitan cities across all age groups. Considering the high proportion of Syphilis reinfections, substantial risk behavior seems to fuel the syphilis epidemic in Germany in MSM, especially in HIV-positive. Targeted approaches to increase early screening and treatment, like internet counselling, home sampling, home testing, and venue-based (rapid) testing should be intensified. The slightly decreasing incidence in the first six months of 2020 may be caused by reduced sexual encounters due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Jansen, K.; Bremer, V.",Sexually Transmitted Infections,382,30

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self‐reported psychological status during the preceding fortnight assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ‐9; symptoms of depression) and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD‐7). Optimism about the future was assessed with a 10‐point study‐specific visual analogue scale. RESULTS: 13 829 respondents contributed complete response data. The estimated prevalence of clinically significant symptoms of depression (PHQ‐9 ≥ 10) was 27.6% (95% CI, 26.1–29.1%) and of clinically significant symptoms of anxiety (GAD‐7 ≥ 10) 21.0% (95% CI, 19.6–22.4%); 14.6% of respondents (95% CI, 13.5–16.0%) reported thoughts of being better off dead or self‐harm (PHQ‐9, item 9) on at least some days and 59.2% (95% CI, 57.6–60.7%) that they were more irritable (GAD‐7, item 6). An estimated 28.3% of respondents (95% CI, 27.1–29.6%) reported great optimism about the future (score ≥ 8). People who had lost jobs, were worried about contracting COVID‐19, or for whom the restrictions had a highly adverse impact on daily life were more likely to report symptoms of depression or anxiety, and less likely to report high optimism than people without these experiences. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health problems were widespread among Australians during the first month of the stage two COVID‐19 restrictions; in addition, about one‐quarter of respondents reported mild to moderate symptoms of depression or anxiety. A public mental health response that includes universal, selective and indicated clinical interventions is needed.","Fisher, Jane RW; Tran, Thach D; Hammarberg, Karin; Sastry, Jayagowri; Nguyen, Hau; Rowe, Heather; Popplestone, Sally; Stocker, Ruby; Stubber, Claire; Kirkman, Maggie",Med J Aust,382,16

Recombinant hemagglutinin proteins of H7N9 viruses can be rapidly and efficiently produced with low-level biocontainment facilities. In this study, recombinant H7 antigen was obtained from engineered stable clones of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells for subsequent large-scale production. The stable CHO cell clones were also adapted to grow in serum-free suspension cultures. To improve the immunogenicity of the recombinant H7 antigens, we evaluated the use of a novel combination adjuvant of PELC and CpG (PELC/CpG) to augment the anti-H7N9 immune responses in mice. We compared the effects with other adjuvants such as alum, AddaVax (MF59-like), and several Toll-like receptor ligands such as R848, CpG, and poly (I:C). With the PELC/CpG combination adjuvant, CHO cell-expressed rH7 antigens containing terminally sialylated complex type N-glycans were able to induce high titers of neutralizing antibodies in sera and conferred protection following live virus challenges. These data indicate that the CHO cell-expressed recombinant H7 antigens and a PELC/CpG combination adjuvant can be used for H7N9 subunit vaccine development.","Chen, Ting-Hsuan; Liu, Wen-Chun; Chen, I-Chen; Liu, Chia-Chyi; Huang, Ming-Hsi; Jan, Jia-Tsrong; Wu, Suh-Chin",Vaccine,382,2

Several studies have been conducted to understand the key features of COVID-19 and its public health impact. However, the prognostic factors of COVID-19 are not well studied in the African setting. In this study, we aim to determine the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 cases, immunological and virological courses, interaction with nutritional status, and response to treatment for COVID-19 patients in Ethiopia. METHODS: A multi-center cohort study design will be performed. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to selected treatment centers will be enrolled irrespective of their symptoms and followed-up for 12 months. Baseline epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and imaging data will be collected from treatment records, interviews, physical measurements, and biological samples. Follow-up data collection involves treatment and prognostic outcomes to be measured using different biomarkers and clinical parameters. Data collection will be done electronically using the Open Data Kit (ODK) software package and then exported to STATA/SPSS for analysis. Both descriptive and multivariable analyses will be performed to assess the independent determinants of the treatment outcome and prognosis to generate relevant information for informed prevention and case management. The primary outcomes of this study are death/survival and viral shedding. Secondary outcomes include epidemiological characteristics, clinical features, genetic frequency shifts (genotypic variations), and nutritional status. DISCUSSION: This is the first large prospective cohort study of patients in hospitals with COVID-19 in Ethiopia. The results will enable us to better understand the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Africa. This study will also provide useful information for effective public health measures and future pandemic preparedness and in response to outbreaks. It will also support policymakers in managing the epidemic based on scientific evidence.

Although cellular receptors for coxsackievirus B in EV-B have been identified, receptors mediating virus entry, especially the uncoating process of echovirus and other EV-B remain obscure. Here, we found that human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is the uncoating receptor for major EV-B. FcRn binds to the virus particles in the “canyon” through its FCGRT subunit. By obtaining multiple cryo-electron microscopy structures at different stages of virus entry at atomic or near-atomic resolution, we deciphered the underlying mechanisms of enterovirus attachment and uncoating. These structures revealed that different from the attachment receptor CD55, binding of FcRn to the virions induces efficient release of “pocket factor” under acidic conditions and initiates the conformational changes in viral particle, providing a structural basis for understanding the mechanisms of enterovirus entry.","Zhao, Xin; Zhang, Guigen; Liu, Sheng; Chen, Xiangpeng; Peng, Ruchao; Dai, Lianpan; Qu, Xiao; Li, Shihua; Song, Hao; Gao, Zhengrong; Yuan, Pengfei; Liu, Zhiheng; Li, Changyao; Shang, Zifang; Li, Yan; Zhang, Meifan; Qi, Jianxun; Wang, Han; Du, Ning; Wu, Yan; Bi, Yuhai; Gao, Shan; Shi, Yi; Yan, Jinghua; Zhang, Yong; Xie, Zhengde; Wei, Wensheng; Gao, George F.",Cell,382,1

BACKGROUND: Ambiguity in ever‐evolving knowledge on how to provide care during COVID‐19. Remaining safe has created a sense of urgency, which has in turn created the need for organizations to quickly alter their operational plans and protocols to support measures that increase capacity and establish a culture of safe care and clear communication. However, no known study has described communication in nursing practice during COVID‐19. METHODS: Utilizing qualitative descriptive methodology, semi‐structured interviews were conducted with 100 nurse participants from May to September 2020 and recorded for thematic analysis. The consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative studies (COREQ), a 32‐item checklist, were used to ensure detailed and comprehensive reporting of this qualitative study protocol. FINDINGS: Study participants shared descriptions of how effective communication positively impacted patient care and nursing practice experiences during the first wave of the COVID‐19 pandemic. The thematic network analyses identified the importance of effective communication across three levels: (1) organizational leadership, (2) unit leadership and (3) nurse‐to‐nurse communication. Within this structure, three organizing themes, essential to effective communication, were described including (a) presence, (b) education and (c) emotional support. CONCLUSION: Examining existing crisis communication policies and procedures across healthcare organizations is imperative to maintain highly relevant, innovative, and data‐driven policies and strategies that are fundamental to preserving quality patient care and supporting optimal nursing practice. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING POLICY AND HEALTH POLICY: Effective communication is critical to support nurses through extended periods of crisis. COVID‐19 represents a unique contemporary challenge to the nursing workforce given the high stress and prolonged strain it has created for both human and healthcare supply resources. There is value in nurses’ presence at local, unit level and organizational leadership levels to convey critical information that directly informs leadership decision‐making during unprecedented emergencies such as the COVID‐19 pandemic.","Simonovich, Shannon D.; Spurlark, Roxanne S.; Badowski, Donna; Krawczyk, Susan; Soco, Cheryl; Ponder, Tiffany N.; Rhyner, Debi; Waid, Rachel; Aquino, Elizabeth; Lattner, Christina; Mueller Wiesemann, Lucy; Webber‐Ritchey, Kashica; Li, Suling; Tariman, Joseph D.",Int Nurs Rev,382,9

These diseases have different aetiologies; however, they share the feature of haemodynamic abnormalities, which is mainly due to dysfunction in the contractile proteins that make up the contractile unit known as the sarcomere. To date, pharmacological treatment options are not disease-specific and rather focus on managing the symptoms, without addressing the disease mechanism. Earliest attempts at improving cardiac contractility by modulating the sarcomere indirectly (inotropes) resulted in unwanted effects. In contrast, targeting the sarcomere directly, aided by high-throughput screening systems, could identify small molecules with a superior therapeutic value in cardiac muscle disorders. Herein, an extensive literature review of 21 small molecules directed to five different targets was conducted. A simple scoring system was created to assess the suitability of small molecules for therapy by evaluating them in eight different criteria. Most of the compounds failed due to lack of target specificity or poor physicochemical properties. Six compounds stood out, showing a potential therapeutic value in HCM, DCM or heart failure (HF). Omecamtiv Mecarbil and Danicamtiv (myosin activators), Mavacamten, CK-274 and MYK-581 (myosin inhibitors) and AMG 594 (Ca(2+)-sensitiser) are all small molecules that allosterically modulate troponin or myosin. Omecamtiv Mecarbil showed limited efficacy in phase III GALACTIC-HF trial, while, results from phase III EXPLORER-HCM trial were recently published, indicating that Mavacamten reduced left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction and diastolic dysfunction and improved the health status of patients with HCM. A novel category of small molecules known as “recouplers” was reported to target a phenomenon termed uncoupling commonly found in familial cardiomyopathies but has not progressed beyond preclinical work. In conclusion, the contractile apparatus is a promising target for new drug development.","Alsulami, Khulud; Marston, Steven",Int J Mol Sci,382,1

An oligonucleotide with a completely degenerate sequence of 17 or 23 nucleotides was inserted into a bacterial expression vector. This resulted in an expression library producing random hexa- or octapeptides attached to a β-galactosidase hybrid protein. Mimotopes, or antigenic sequences that mimic an epitope, were selected by immunoscreening of colonies with monoclonal antibodies, which were specific for antigenic sites on the spike protein of the coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus. We report one mimotope for antigenic site II, eight for site III and one for site IV. The site III and site IV mimotopes were closely similar to the corresponding linear epitopes, localized previously in the amino acid sequence of the S protein. An alignment of the site II mimotope and the sequence of the S protein around Trp97, which is substituted in escape mutants, suggests that this mimotope mimics a conformational epitope located around residues 97–103. Applications of mimotopes to epitope mapping, serodiagnosis and vaccine development are discussed.","Lenstra, Johannes A.; Erkens, Joannes H.F.; Langeveld, J.G.A.; Posthumus, Willem P.A.; Meloen, Rob H.; Gebauer, Fátima; Correa, Isabela; Enjuanes, Luis; Stanley, Keith K.",Journal of Immunological Methods,382,26

Methods: In this retrospective study, all patients who were admitted to Shahid Sadoughi and Shahid Rahnemoun hospitals in Yazd from February to March 2020 with definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 and needed intubation were enrolled. Patients were divided into 4 groups based on the type of drugs used in intubation, and mortality rate was assessed at the end of the first, second, fourth, and seventh days of the study. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 20 and P values <.05 was considered significant. Results: In this study, 76 patients were examined. Patients were divided into 4 groups, of which 21 were in etomidate group, 8 in ketamine group, 21 in sodium thiopental group, and 35 in midazolam group. Mortality rate in these 4 groups was 25%, 12.5%, 14.3%, and 14.3% (p=0.822), respectively at the end of the first day after intubation; it was 83.3%, 12.5%, 28.6%, and 25.7% (p=0.001), respectively, at the end of the second day; it was 83.3%, 12.5%, 42.9%, and 42.9% (p=0.015), respectively, until the end of the fourth day; it was 100%, 25%, 61.9%, and 65.7% (p=0.007), respectively, until the end of the seventh day.

The use of quarantine and isolation proved effective in containing the spread of infection. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to assess the mental health of Albanian people residing in the country and abroad during the quarantine period for the Covid-19 pandemic. DESIGN: This study was carried out from 25th March – 20th April 2020 through a web survey shared on social networks. The goal was to reach at least the minimum sample size for cross-sectional studies. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to assess mental health. Chi-square (χ(2)) and Fisher –Exact test were used to assess the statistical significance among variables. P values ≤0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: 715 participants were included in the final analyses (78.41% females and 21.53% males). Most were residents in Albania (80.41%) and the others resided mainly in Italy (6.89%), Greece (3.51%), Germany (2.43%), Kosovo (1.62%) and the UK (1.69%).

We tested the possibility that qualitative differences in SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody-mediated innate immune functions contribute to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity. We found that anti-S1 and anti-RBD antibodies from hospitalized COVID-19 patients elicited higher ADCD but lower ADCP compared to antibodies from nonhospitalized COVID-19 patients.

Chest radiograph (CXR) has been playing a crucial role in COVID-19 patient triaging, diagnosing and monitoring, particularly in the United States. Considering the mixed and unspecific signals in CXR, an image retrieval model of CXR that provides both similar images and associated clinical information can be more clinically meaningful than a direct image diagnostic model. In this work we develop a novel CXR image retrieval model based on deep metric learning. Unlike traditional diagnostic models which aim at learning the direct mapping from images to labels, the proposed model aims at learning the optimized embedding space of images, where images with the same labels and similar contents are pulled together. The proposed model utilizes multi-similarity loss with hard-mining sampling strategy and attention mechanism to learn the optimized embedding space, and provides similar images, the visualizations of disease-related attention maps and useful clinical information to assist clinical decisions. The model is trained and validated on an international multi-site COVID-19 dataset collected from 3 different sources. Experimental results of COVID-19 image retrieval and diagnosis tasks show that the proposed model can serve as a robust solution for CXR analysis and patient management for COVID-19. The model is also tested on its transferability on a different clinical decision support task for COVID-19, where the pre-trained model is applied to extract image features from a new dataset without any further training. The extracted features are then combined with COVID-19 patient's vitals, lab tests and medical histories to predict the possibility of airway intubation in 72 hours, which is strongly associated with patient prognosis, and is crucial for patient care and hospital resource planning. These results demonstrate our deep metric learning based image retrieval model is highly efficient in the CXR retrieval, diagnosis and prognosis, and thus has great clinical value for the treatment and management of COVID-19 patients.","Zhong, Aoxiao; Li, Xiang; Wu, Dufan; Ren, Hui; Kim, Kyungsang; Kim, Younggon; Buch, Varun; Neumark, Nir; Bizzo, Bernardo; Tak, Won Young; Park, Soo Young; Lee, Yu Rim; Kang, Min Kyu; Park, Jung Gil; Kim, Byung Seok; Chung, Woo Jin; Guo, Ning; Dayan, Ittai; Kalra, Mannudeep K.; Li, Quanzheng",Med Image Anal,382,22

In this work, the impact of confinement on perceived sleep quality and depression is evaluated through questionnaires, as well as the mediating role of Emotional Intelligence (EI) in this relationship. Our results show, firstly, higher prevalence of depressive symptoms in women and young people associated with poorer perceived sleep quality, and secondly, that Emotional Intelligence intervenes as a mediator in this relationship through three different pathways. Worse perceived quality of sleep causes a greater number of depressive symptoms. In addition, this direct relationship may be enhanced by the mediating role of Emotional Intelligence, which we can express in three different ways: low perceived sleep quality and high emotional attention lead to greater depression; low perceived sleep quality and low emotional clarity increase greater symptoms of depression; and low perceived sleep quality together with low clarity and low emotional repair increase levels of depression. Therefore, we can conclude that improving the skills involved in Emotional Intelligence might increase perceived sleep quality, and thus reduce depressive symptoms, which in turn may improve the quality of life.","Salguero-Alcañiz, María Pilar; Merchán-Clavellino, Ana; Alameda-Bailén, Jose Ramón",Int J Environ Res Public Health,382,14

Risk of moderate-to-severe or critical illness increased with the number of underlying medical or pregnancy-related conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Older age and having underlying medical conditions were associated with increased risk of moderate-to-severe or critical COVID-19 illness among pregnant women. This information might help pregnant women understand their risk for moderate-to-severe or critical COVID-19 illness and inform targeted public health messaging.","Galang, Romeo R; Newton, Suzanne M; Woodworth, Kate R; Griffin, Isabel; Oduyebo, Titilope; Sancken, Christina L; Olsen, Emily O'Malley; Aveni, Kathryn; Wingate, Heather; Shephard, Hanna; Fussman, Chris; Alaali, Zahra S; Silcox, Kristin; Siebman, Samantha; Halai, Umme-Aiman; Lopez, Camille Delgado; Lush, Mamie; Sokale, Ayomide; Barton, Jerusha; Chaudhary, Ifrah; Patrick, Paul H; Schlosser, Levi; Reynolds, Bethany; Gaarenstroom, Nicole; Chicchelly, Sarah; Read, Jennifer S; de Wilde, Leah; Mbotha, Deborah; Azziz-Baumgartner, Eduardo; Hall, Aron J; Tong, Van T; Ellington, Sascha; Gilboa, Suzanne M",Clin Infect Dis,382,1

However, there are technologies that can have high PN levels, especially below the currently lower regulated particle size of 23 nm. Sub-23-nm particles are also considered at least as dangerous as the larger ultrafine particles. For this reason, the European Union (EU) is planning to regulate particles down to 10 nm. In this study we compared prototype portable emission measurement systems (PEMS) and reference laboratory systems measuring from 10 nm. The tests included cycles and constant speeds, using vehicles fuelled with diesel, gasoline or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The results showed that the PEMS were within ±40% of the reference systems connected to the tailpipe and the dilution tunnel. Based on the positive findings and the detection efficiencies of the prototype instruments, a proposal for the technical specifications for the future regulation was drafted.","Giechaskiel, Barouch; Lähde, Tero; Gandi, Sawan; Keller, Stefan; Kreutziger, Philipp; Mamakos, Athanasios",Int J Environ Res Public Health,382,24

Thrombotic complications due to considerable inflammation, cytokine-mediated microvascular damage and pulmonary immunothrombosis formation seem to have emerged as an important issue in people infected with COVID-19. Methods This study reviewed consecutive symptomatic patients with proven COVID-19 infection admitted to Acibadem University Hospital in Istanbul, Turkey (15 March–25 May 2020). The primary outcome was any venous thromboembolic (VTE) complication. The secondary outcome was the incidence of subsegmental pulmonary embolism with or without deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which represented immunothrombosis development. Results The mean age was 55.7±17.4 years (range, 29–84); 224 (63.6%) were men. Of those patients, 12 (3.4%) died, 273 (77.5%) were discharged alive and 67 (19.1%) were still hospitalised as of 25 May 2020. VTE events occurred in 58 patients with a cumulative rate of 16.4% during the study period. The surprising discovery was that DVT was not identified in 20 (86.9%) of the 23 patients with subsegmental pulmonary embolism, which corroborated the pulmonary immunothrombosis theory. Conclusions The high incidence of VTE events suggests an important role of COVID-19-induced coagulopathy. Thus, repeated assessment and optimised treatment are necessary to reduce the occurrence of VTE and prevent fatal pulmonary embolism events. Further studies are needed to investigate the molecular mechanism of this immunothrombosis development.","Dumantepe, Mert; Aydın, Selim; Yildiz, Erdem; Okur, Hacer Kuzu; Kocagöz, A.

On the basis of size and shape 7 distinct viral types were detected: 24 nm parvovirus‐like particles, 30 nm astrovirus, 30 nm picornavirus‐like particles, reovirus, rotavirus, coronavirus and a 75 nm “togavirus‐like” particle. The incidence of these particles in the 208 cats was 11%, 7%, 6%, 0.4%, 5%, 1% and 1% respectively. Virus isolation studies using 40 of the faecal samples succeeded in isolating reovirus 1 in 2 cases. Immune electron microscope studies demonstrated the presence of antibody in a human serum to cat astrovirus, but failed to clarify the identity of the parvovirus‐like particles and picornavirus‐like particles, other than showing that some of the parvovirus‐like particles were not related to feline panleukopenia virus. It was found that parvovirus‐like particles, astrovirus, picornavirus‐like particles, reovirus and rotavirus could be excreted by cats with normal faeces as well as cats with diarrhoeal faeces. Parvovirus‐like particles, astrovirus, picornavirus‐like particles and rotavirus could be excreted in high concentration in normal faeces. There was no simple relationship between age and diarrhoea in the population of cats studied. Age was not a critical factor in the excretion of parvovirus‐like particles, astrovirus, picornavirus‐like particles and rotavirus. The incidence of diarrhoea was not clearly associated with the seasons.","MARSHALL, J. A.; KENNETT, M. L.; RODGER, S. M.; STUDDERT, M. J.; THOMPSON, W. L.; GUST, I. D.",Aust Vet J,382,16

METHODS: Firstly, the active components of SQW were screened from TCMSP and the 2020 edition of Chinese Pharmacopoeia, and the related targets of the components were obtained. Then the disease targets related to COVID-19 were screened from GeneCards and OMIM. Venny was used to map the relationship between component-target and disease-target, and String was used to analyzing the interaction of common targets. The network was constructed and analyzed by Cytoscape, the function of GO and KEGG genes was enriched by Metascape, and the molecular docking was verified by CB-Dock. RESULTS: Finally, 45 active components of SQW were obtained, and 72 potential targets were related to COVID-19, ACE2, IL6, NOS3, and CRP may be the key targets. GO enrichment of 1715 projects, such as lipopolysaccharide stress response, active oxygen metabolism, positive regulation of cell migration, and other GO enrichment. 136 KEGG pathways were obtained, TNF signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, HIF-1 signaling pathway. Molecular docking showed that kaempferol, quercetin, luteolin, astragaloside, calyx isoflavone glucoside, matrine, and other COVID-19-related targets such as ACE2, 3CLpro, PLpro, PTGS2 have good binding ability. CONCLUSION: According to the above results, it is suggested that SQW may play a role in the treatment of COVID-19 by directly or indirectly combining kaempferol, quercetin, and luteolin with ACE2, 3CLpro, PLpro, and PTGS2 to regulate multiple biological functions and signaling pathways.","Ye, Xian-Wen; Deng, Ya-Ling; Zhang, Xia; Liu, Min-Min; Liu, Ying; Xie, Ya-Ting; Wan, Quan; Huang, Min; Zhang, Tao; Xi, Jia-He; Zhang, Jin-Lian",Drug Dev Ind Pharm,382,32

The fibers were deposited onto non-woven spunbond polypropylene (SPP) and the basis weight (grammage, g/m(2)) was varied to assess the resulting effect on filtration efficiency and breathing resistance of the materials. The results indicated that a basis weight in excess of 0.4 g/m(2) of PAN electrospun fibers yielded a filtration efficiency over 97%, with breathing resistance values that increased proportionally with the amount of basis weight added. With the aim of retaining filter efficiency whilst lowering breathing resistance, the basis weight of 0.4 g/m(2) and 0.8 g/m(2) of PAN electrospun fibers were strategically split up and stacked with SPP in different configurations. The results suggested that a symmetric structure based on SPP/PAN/PAN/SPP was the optimal structure, as it reduces SPP consumption while maintaining an FFP2-type of filtration efficiency, while reducing breathing resistance, specially at high air flow rates, such as those mimicking FFP2 exhalation conditions. The incorporation of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles within the electrospun nanofibers in the form of nanocomposites, retained the high filtration characteristics of the unfilled filter, while exhibiting a strong bactericidal capacity, even after short contact times. This study demonstrates the potential of using the symmetric splitting of the PAN nanofibers layer as a somewhat more efficient configuration in the design of filters for respirators.","Pardo-Figuerez, Maria; Chiva-Flor, Alberto; Figueroa-Lopez, Kelly; Prieto, Cristina; Lagaron, Jose M.",Nanomaterials (Basel),382,30

Based on structural data derived from X-ray crystallographic data of related trypsin-like proteases, a homology model of TMPRSS2 is described and validated using the broad spectrum COVID-19 drug candidate camostat as a probe. Both active site recognition and catalytic function are examined using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics molecular dynamic (QM/MM MD) simulations of camostat and its active metabolite, 4-(4-guanidinobenzoyloxy) phenylacetate (GBPA). Substrate binding is shown to be primarily stabilized through salt bridge formation between the shared guanidino pharmacophore and D435 in pocket A (flanking the catalytic S441). Based on the binding mode of GBPA, residues K342 and W461 have been identified as potential contacts involved in TMPRSS2 selective binding and activity. Additional data is reported that indicates the transition state structure is stabilized through H-bonding interactions with the backbone N–H groups within an oxyanion hole following bottom-side attack of the carbonyl by S441. This is supported by prior work on related serine proteases suggesting further strategies to exploit in the design of more potent inhibitors. Taken overall, the proposed structure along with the key contact sites and mechanistic features identified should prove highly advantageous to the design and rational development of safe and effective therapeutics that target TMPRSS2 and avoid inhibition of other trypsin-dependent processes.

However, as in past disasters, their involvement was oriented towards urgent tasks, and did not fully utilize EHPs’ competences and skills. Additionally, due to limited resources, during emergencies EHPs may temporarily transition away from their day-to-day role, potentially increasing other public health and safety risk factors without appropriate surveillance or intervention. To overcome this and prepare for possible future pandemics, it is important to identify and discuss the key roles of EHPs in different countries, providing a common framework for practices that can contribute to population safety and health. To this end, an international workgroup was established to discuss current environmental health practices and challenges across different countries during the pandemic. Findings from discussions concluded that, despite the observed differences across the countries, EHPs are one of the main public health emergency preparedness and response actors. However, since resources are still lagging significantly behind need, we argue that the role of these professionals during pandemics should be focused on practices that have higher impact to support population health and safety.","Rodrigues, Matilde A.; Silva, Manuela V.; Errett, Nicole A.; Davis, Gayle; Lynch, Zena; Dhesi, Surindar; Hannelly, Toni; Mitchell, Graeme; Dyjack, David; Ross, Kirstin E.",Saf Sci,382,1

Severe adult respiratory syndrome-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia is associated with a high risk of mortality. However, prognostic factors predicting poor clinical outcomes of individual patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia remain under intensive investigation. We conducted a retrospective, multicenter study of patients with SARS-CoV-2 who were admitted to four hospitals in Wuhan, China from December 2019 to February 2020. Mortality at the end of the follow up period was the primary outcome. Factors predicting mortality were also assessed and a prognostic model was developed, calibrated and validated. The study included 492 patients with SARS-CoV-2 who were divided into three cohorts: the training cohort (n = 237), the validation cohort 1 (n = 120), and the validation cohort 2 (n = 135). Multivariate analysis showed that five clinical parameters were predictive of mortality at the end of follow up period, including advanced age [odds ratio (OR), 1.1/years increase (p < 0.001)], increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio [(NLR) OR, 1.14/increase (p < 0.001)], elevated body temperature on admission [OR, 1.53/°C increase (p = 0.005)], increased aspartate transaminase [OR, 2.47 (p = 0.019)], and decreased total protein [OR, 1.69 (p = 0.018)]. Furthermore, the prognostic model drawn from the training cohort was validated with validation cohorts 1 and 2 with comparable area under curves (AUC) at 0.912, 0.928, and 0.883, respectively. While individual survival probabilities were assessed, the model yielded a Harrell’s C index of 0.758 for the training cohort, 0.762 for the validation cohort 1, and 0.711 for the validation cohort 2, which were comparable among each other. A validated prognostic model was developed to assist in determining the clinical prognosis for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Using this established model, individual patients categorized in the high risk group were associated with an increased risk of mortality, whereas patients predicted to be in the low risk group had a higher probability of survival.","Mei, Qi; Wang, Amanda Y.; Bryant, Amy; Yang, Yang; Li, Ming; Wang, Fei; Zhao, Jia Wei; Ma, Ke; Wu, Liang; Chen, Huawen; Luo, Jinlong; Du, Shangming; Halfter, Kathrin; Li, Yong; Kurts, Christian; Hu, Guangyuan; Yuan, Xianglin; Li, Jian",Sci Rep,382,30

Whilst the bacterial causes of NMFI are well known, the increasing use of sensitive techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests is revealing large numbers of viruses that are potential respiratory pathogens. However, many of these organisms are commonly present in the respiratory tract of healthy children so causality and risk factors for pneumonia remain poorly understood. Inflection with a combination of viral and bacterial pathogens is increasingly recognised as important in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. Similarly, blood stream inflections with organisms typically grown by aerobic culture are well known but a growing number of organisms that can be identified only by PCR, viral culture, or serology are now recognised to be common pathogens in African children. The high mortality of hospitalised children on the first or second day of admission suggests that, unless results are rapidly available, diagnostic tests to identify specific causes of illness will still be of limited use in guiding the potentially life saving decisions relating to initial treatment of children admitted to district hospitals in Africa with severe febrile illness and a negative test for malaria. Malaria control and the introduction of vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b and pneumococcal disease are contributing to improved child survival in Africa. However, increased parasitological testing for malaria is associated with increased use of antbiotics to which resistance is already high.","Muro, Florid; Reyburn, Rita; Reyburn, Hugh",Pneumonia (Nathan),382,20

While IFITMs are widely known to inhibit several single-stranded RNA viruses, there are limited reports available regarding their effect in double-stranded DNA viruses. In this work, we have analyzed a possible antiviral function of IFITMs against a double stranded DNA virus, the African swine fever virus (ASFV). Infection with cell-adapted ASFV isolate Ba71V is IFN sensitive and it induces IFITMs expression. Interestingly, high levels of IFITMs caused a collapse of the endosomal pathway to the perinuclear area. Given that ASFV entry is strongly dependent on endocytosis, we investigated whether IFITM expression could impair viral infection. Expression of IFITM1, 2 and 3 reduced virus infectivity in Vero cells, with IFITM2 and IFITM3 having an impact on viral entry/uncoating. The role of IFITM2 in the inhibition of ASFV in Vero cells could be related to impaired endocytosis-mediated viral entry and alterations in the cholesterol efflux, suggesting that IFITM2 is acting at the late endosome, preventing the decapsidation stage of ASFV.","Muñoz-Moreno, Raquel; Cuesta-Geijo, Miguel Ángel; Martínez-Romero, Carles; Barrado-Gil, Lucía; Galindo, Inmaculada; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Alonso, Covadonga",PLoS One,382,20

Here, we describe a novel method for measurement of double-stranded RNA using a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence assay. This method allowed detection of human rhinovirus (HRV), enterovirus, coxsackievirus, and murine norovirus. Furthermore, this method detected antiviral activity of a HRV 3C protease inhibitor.

The pathogenesis is most often revealed by pulmonary conditions, including acute thoracic syndrome, which is affecting the life expectancy of these populations. The global spread of CoV2-SARS infection with a respiratory tropism, endothelial damages and procoagulant status endangers the SCD population. However, with only a few case reports, consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on SCD population remain poorly known. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 33-year-old man with a history of homozygous SS homozygous sickle cell anemia who consulted on March 24, 2020 for febrile dyspnea 11 days after the onset of symptoms. A nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2. His respiratory status worsened rapidly in the emergency room and then in ICU leading to severe ARDS requiring intubation, curarization, and venovenous ECMO. Hematologically, severe hemolysis associated with major thrombocytopenia without documented spinal cord injury was noted. Several transfusion exchanges are performed. The evolution was finally slowly favorable and led to discharge from the intensive care unit and then from the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: This case recalls the importance of an increased prevention policy against COVID-19among the SCD population. In addition, from a therapeutic point of view, it advocates (1) a high preventive anticoagulation from the outset according to the level of D-dimers (2) the use of venovenous ECMO in this particular case, whereas this technique has had rather disappointing results in acute chest syndromes. (3) Unexpectedly, our patient did not develop pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and acute cor pulmonale (ACP), whereas this is a common feature of ARDS during SCD. These last two observations suggest a different pathophysiology of pulmonary disorders in SCD patients in the case of SARS COv2. It could be associated with marked hypoxemia secondary to pulmonary vascular vasodilation.","Teulier, Marion; Elabbadi, Alexandre; Gerotziafas, Grigorios; Lionnet, François; Voiriot, Guillaume; Fartoukh, Muriel",BMC Pulm Med,382,25

These guidelines include recommendations for researchers, policymakers, funders, publishers and infrastructure providers from the perspective of different domains (Clinical Medicine, Omics, Epidemiology, Social Sciences, Community Participation, Indigenous Peoples, Research Software, Legal and Ethical Considerations). Several overarching themes have emerged from this document such as the need to balance the creation of data adherent to FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable), with the need for quick data release; the use of trustworthy research data repositories; the use of well-annotated data with meaningful metadata; and practices of documenting methods and software. The resulting document marks an unprecedented cross-disciplinary, cross-sectoral, and cross-jurisdictional effort authored by over 160 experts from around the globe.

Plasma, the starting material for these products, is collected by plasmapheresis (source plasma) or derived from whole blood donations (recovered plasma). The primary measures regarding pathogen safety are selection of healthy donors donating in centers with appropriate epidemiologic data for the main blood‐transmissible viruses, screening donations for the absence of relevant infectious blood‐borne viruses, and release of plasma pools for further processing only if they are nonreactive for serologic markers and nucleic acids for these viruses. Despite this testing, pathogen inactivation and/or removal during the manufacturing process of plasma‐derived clotting factor concentrates is required to ensure prevention of transmission of infectious agents. Historically, hepatitis viruses and human immunodeficiency virus have posed the greatest threat to patients receiving plasma‐derived therapy for treatment of hemophilia or von Willebrand disease. Over the past 30 years, dedicated virus inactivation and removal steps have been integrated into factor concentrate production processes, essentially eliminating transmission of these viruses. Manufacturing steps used in the purification of factor concentrates have also proved to be successful in reducing potential prion infectivity. In this review, current techniques for inactivation and removal of pathogens from factor concentrates are discussed. Ideally, production processes should involve a combination of complementary steps for pathogen inactivation and/or removal to ensure product safety. Finally, potential batch‐to‐batch contamination is avoided by stringent cleaning and sanitization methods as part of the manufacturing process.","Klamroth, Robert; Gröner, Albrecht; Simon, Toby L.",Transfusion,382,12

Cadavers with an ante-mortem confirmed diagnosis of moderate to severe COVID-19 were examined. Clinical and demographic features were retrieved from hospital patients’ notes. For each cadaver, corneal scrapings, conjunctival swabs (CS) and nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) were collected to perform real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ((RT)-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. Fourteen consecutive cadavers with an ante-mortem confirmed diagnosis of moderate to severe COVID-19 were examined.

We aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, socioeconomic burden, and the mental health problems regarding anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder during COVID-19 on the general population and HCWs in Egypt. METHODS: This study was conducted using a semi-structured online questionnaire in May 2020. Data on demographic features, socioeconomic scale, knowledge, and attitude regarding COVID-19 and the effect on different aspects of life were collected. Assessment was done using Arabic versions of Beck’s Anxiety Inventory, Beck’s Depression Inventory–II, and Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. We divided participants into non-health care workers (non-HCWs) and HCWs groups. RESULTS: There were 524 participants who responded to the survey from 23 governorates. More than half of the participants were females (57.4%), middle age (53%), and middle socioeconomic class (66.6%). Non-HCWs were 402 and HCWs were 122. Most participants had good knowledge about the disease and a positive attitude toward protective measures particularly in HCWs. COVID-19 showed negative impact on different aspects of participants’ life. HCWs had higher frequency of anxiety (32%) and OCD (29%) than non-HCWs (30% and 28%, respectively) while non-HCWs had higher depression (69%) than HCWs (66.4%). HCWs had higher rates of severe depression (20.5%) with moderate and severe OCD (4.9%, 1.6% respectively) than non-HCWs. Female gender, young age, urban residence, students, smoking, history of medical illness, and low socioeconomic class were significant associated factors. CONCLUSIONS: Health care workers had good knowledge about COVID-19 and a positive attitude toward the protective measures relative to non-HCWs. COVID-19 had a negative impact on different aspects of life and had a major association with the anxiety, depression, and OCD in both groups. Health professionals are more likely to have these psychological consequences.

To develop an effective vaccine that does not enhance RSV illness, it is important to understand how formalin and heat inactivation affected the antigenicity and immunogenicity of FI-RSV compared to native virus. Informed by atomic structures of RSV fusion (F) glycoprotein in prefusion (pre-F) and postfusion (post-F) conformations, we demonstrate that FI-RSV predominately presents post-F on the virion surface, whereas infectious RSV presents both pre-F and post-F conformations. This significant antigenic distinction has not been previously appreciated. Thus, a stabilized pre-F antigen is more representative of live RSV than F in its post-F conformation, as displayed on the surface of FI-RSV. This finding has major implications for discriminating current pre-F-based immunogens from FI-RSV used in historical vaccine trials.","Killikelly, April M.; Kanekiyo, Masaru; Graham, Barney S.",Sci Rep,382,32

Overall, the current results shed light on that in comparison with the pre-Covid-19 period, and the return spillover is more apparent during the Covid-19 crisis. However, levels of the intensity of this relationship vary through the period of research, with several intervals witnessing both negative and positive interactions. Further, our findings indicate significant heterogeneity among agriculture commodity markets in the degree of spillover to crude oil prices over time, amplifying our understanding of the economic channels through which the agriculture commodity markets are correlated.

Patient characteristics, electrocardiographic data, and clinical and laboratory information were retrospectively collected. Patients not treated with drugs that blunt chronotropic response (nodal) were analyzed separately. RESULTS: Only patients whose heart rate was <60 beats per minute (bpm) (136/221, 61.5%) were included. Serial electrocardiography revealed that most patients (130/137, 97.7%) remained in sinus rhythm. The heart rate was between 50 and 59 bpm in 75% of the patients, while 18.4% were in the 40 to 49 bpm range, and 6.6% were <40 bpm. Medians for development of bradycardia after swab polymerase chain reaction positivity and duration of bradycardia were 41 hours and 5 days, respectively. Bradycardia resolved in 81 patients (59.6%). There were no statistically significant differences in outcomes according to degree of bradycardia (<50 vs 50–59, all P ≥ 0.073). No significant differences were noted for the overall cohort when comparing COVID-19 treatments according to resolution of bradycardia; however, when considering only the patients who were not receiving a nodal agent or antiarrhythmic, treatment with lenzilumab was more common in patients with resolution of bradycardia than patients without resolution of bradycardia (12.2% vs 0.0%, P = 0.030).

The main aim of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the Romanian version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), based on classical test theory and item response theory, namely, graded response model. The FCV-19S was translated into Romanian following a forward-backward translation procedure. The reliability and validity of the instrument were assessed in a sample of 809 adults (34.6% males; M(age) = 32.61; SD ±11.25; age range from 18 to 68 years). Results showed that the Romanian FCV-19S had very good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = .88; McDonald’s omega = .89; composite reliability = .89). The confirmatory factor analysis for one-factor FCV-19S based on the maximum likelihood estimation method with Satorra-Bentler correction for non-normality proved that the model fitted well (CFI = .99, TLI = .97, RMSEA = .06, 90% CI [.05, .09], SRMR = .01). As for criterion-related validity, the fear of COVID-19 score correlated with depression (r = .25, p < .01), stress (r = .45, p < .01), resilience (r = − .22, p < .01) and happiness (r = −.33, p < .01). The heterotrait-monotrait criteria less than .85 certified the discriminant validity of the FCV-19S-RO. The GRM analysis highlighted robust psychometric properties of the scale and measurement invariance across gender. These findings emphasized validity for the use of Romanian version of FCV-19S and expanding the existing body of research on the fear of COVID-19. Overall, the current research contributes to the literature not only by validating the FCV-19S-RO but also by considering the positive psychology approach in the study of fear of COVID-19, emphasizing a negative relationship among resilience, happiness and fear in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Stănculescu, Elena",Int J Ment Health Addict,382,33

The internal proteins of batFLUAV are functional in mammalian cells. In contrast, no biological functionality could be demonstrated for the surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA)-like (HAL) and neuraminidase (NA)-like (NAL), and these proteins need to be replaced by their human counterparts to allow spread of batFLUAV in human cells. Here, we employed rhabdoviral vectors to study the role of HAL and NAL in viral entry. Vectors pseudotyped with batFLUAV-HAL and -NAL were able to enter bat cells but not cells from other mammalian species. Host cell entry was mediated by HAL and was dependent on prior proteolytic activation of HAL and endosomal low pH. In contrast, sialic acids were dispensable for HAL-driven entry. Finally, the type II transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 was able to activate HAL for cell entry indicating that batFLUAV can utilize human proteases for HAL activation. Collectively, these results identify viral and cellular factors governing host cell entry driven by batFLUAV surface proteins. They suggest that the absence of a functional receptor precludes entry of batFLUAV into human cells while other prerequisites for entry, HAL activation and protonation, are met in target cells of human origin.","Hoffmann, Markus; Krüger, Nadine; Zmora, Pawel; Wrensch, Florian; Herrler, Georg; Pöhlmann, Stefan",PLoS One,382,20

Several studies have reported the impact of COVID-19 in general population; however, there is scarcity of information related to pharmacological management and maternal and perinatal outcomes during the pandemic. Altered physiological, anatomical, and immunological response during pregnancy makes it more susceptible to infections. Furthermore, during pregnancy, a woman undergoes multiple interactions with the health care system that increases her chance of getting infected; therefore, managing pregnant population presents a unique challenge. RESEARCH QUESTIONS: What are the different clinical characteristics presented in maternal and perinatal population? What are the different maternal and perinatal outcome measures reported? What are the distinct therapeutic interventions reported to treat COVID-19? Is it safe to use “medications” used in the treatment of COVID-19 during antenatal, perinatal, postnatal, and breastfeeding? METHOD: The search will follow a comprehensive, sequential three step search strategy. Several databases relevant to COVID-19 and its impact on pregnancy including Medline, CINAHL, and LitCovid will be searched from the inception of the disease until the completion of data collection. The quality of this search strategy will be assessed using Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies Evidence-Based Checklist (PRESS EBC). An eligibility form will be developed for a transparent screening and inclusion/exclusion of studies.

Several major risk factors for mortality identified in the analysis were treated as a minor risk or neutral or even protective factors. Antiviral treatments were recognised as an effective method to reduce mortality and were neither further studied nor integrated in the multivariate Cox model. Conclusion This research appeared to carry multiple biases. An extensive audit of the study, conditions of review and acceptance for publication in the Lancet of that study are requested to avoid damage to the publics’ trust on the scientific community at this critical time of COVID-19 pandemic.","Toumi, Mondher; Biernikiewicz, Malgorzata; Liang, Shuyao; Wang, Yitong; Qiu, Tingting; Han, Ru",Journal of market access & health policy,382,13

However, based on current knowledge about drivers of disease emergence, we show that High Asia is rapidly developing conditions that favor increased emergence of infectious diseases and zoonoses. This is because of the existing prevalence of potentially serious pathogens in the system; intensifying environmental degradation; rapid changes in local ecological, socio-ecological, and socio-economic factors; and global risk intensifiers such as climate change and globalization. To better understand and manage the risks posed by diseases to humans, livestock, and wildlife, there is an urgent need for establishing a disease surveillance system and improving human and animal health care.

We evaluated the initial feasibility, acceptability, usability, and effectiveness of three computerized simulations (two cognitive behavioral therapy, one motivational interviewing) during an interpersonal practice course among 22 students in a Master of Social Work program accredited by the Council on Social Work Education. Trainees repetitively practiced their clinical skills with virtual clients while receiving feedback via real-time nonverbal cues, transcript review, and performance assessment across pre-specified theoretical learning objectives. Across the three simulations, at least 86.4% of students completed the required protocol and completed M = 468.95 (SD = 178.27) minutes of simulated sessions. Students improved their scores (range 0 to 100) across all the simulations from M = 63.41 (SD = 11.13) to M = 93.64 (SD = 3.24). Students found the simulations to be acceptable with strong usability. Paired sample t-tests revealed students reported greater self-efficacy in general clinical skills, exploration skills, insight skills, and action skills between pre-test and post-test after completing the simulations (all p < 0.001). Students reported that the clinical skills learned from the simulations translated into successful interactions with real-world clients during their field placements.

In this study, we address the energy, environmental, and economic benefits of the decontamination-and-reuse of the N95 masks. Two popular decontamination methods, including dry heat and vapor hydrogen peroxide (VHP), are investigated in this study for their effective pathogen inactivation and favorable performance in preserving filtration efficiency and structural integrity of respirators. Two multiple reuse cases, under which the N95 masks are disinfected and used five times with the dry heat method and 20 times using the VHP method, are considered and compared with a single-use case. Compared to the single-use case, the dry heat-based multiple-use case reduces carbon footprint by 50% and cumulative energy demand (CED) by 17%, while the VHP-based case decreases carbon footprint by 67% and CED by 58%. The dry-heat-based and VHP-based multiple reuse cases also present environmental benefits in most of the other impact categories, primarily due to substituting new N95 respirators with decontaminated ones. Decontaminating and reusing respirators costs 77% and 89% less than the case of single-use and disposal. The sensitivity analysis results show that the geographical variation in the power grid and the times of respirator use are the most influential factors for carbon footprint and CED, respectively. The result also reaffirms the energy, environmental, and economic favorability of the decontamination and reuse of N95 respirators.","Tao, Yanqiu; You, Fengqi",Appl Energy,382,3

The birds were suffering from respiratory and nephropathological symptoms and lesions. A 1116 bp hyper mutable spike glycoprotein (S1) gene was amplified and sequenced using conventional RT-PCR. Sequence analysis and BLAST homology search in GenBank data base indicate that two of the farms were infected with the 4/91 strain, one with an unidentified IBV and five were infected with Sul/01/09. The birds in the latter five farms were suffering from nephropathogenic lesions, however, the virus was isolated from kidney but not from trachea in these cases. The birds were vaccinated regularly with 4/91 or MA5 vaccine. The deduced amino acid sequence of the isolated and amplified S1 subunit (372 aa) of Sul/01/09 was differed in 27–28% from that of all three vaccine strains (4/91, MA5, and H120) used in the region. This dissimilarity is most likely the cause of poor efficacy of vaccines used in the region, at least in five of these farms. Amino acid sequence comparison and phylogenetic tree analysis with other published IBV genotypes indicate that this newly isolated virus together with other regionally related and recently published isolates from Israel (IS/720/99, IS/885) and Egypt (egypt/Benisuef/01) belong to a new genotype. This is the first report of identification and genotyping of IBV isolate in Iraq, which indicate the circulation of 4/91 along with a new variant (Sul/01/09) of IBV in vaccinated broiler farms.","Mahmood, Zana H.; Sleman, Rizgar R.; Uthman, Aumaid U.",Vet Microbiol,382,16

Limited evidence on the systematic evaluation of the impact of treatment regimens on antibody responses exists. Our study aimed to analyze the role of antibody response on prognosis and determine factors influencing the IgG antibodies’ seroconversion. A total of 1,111 patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms admitted to Leishenshan Hospital in Wuhan were retrospectively analyzed. A serologic SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibody test was performed on all the patients 21 days after the onset of symptoms. Patient clinical characteristics were compared. In the study, 42 patients progressed to critical illness, with 6 mortalities reported while 1,069 patients reported mild to moderate disease. Advanced age (P = 0.028), gasping (P < 0.001), dyspnea (P = 0.024), and IgG negativity (P = 0.006) were associated with progression to critical illness. The mortality rate in critically ill patients with IgG antibody was 6.45% (95% CI 1.12–22.84%) and 36.36% (95% CI 12.36–68.38%) in patients with no IgG antibody (P = 0.003). Symptomatic patients were more likely to develop IgG antibody responses than asymptomatic patients. Using univariable analysis, fever (P < 0.001), gasping (P = 0.048), cancer (P < 0.001), cephalosporin (P = 0.015), and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (P = 0.021) were associated with IgG response. In the multivariable analysis, fever, cancer, cephalosporins, and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine correlated independently with IgG response. We determined that the absence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody IgG in the convalescent stage had a specific predictive role in critical illness progression. Importantly, risk factors affecting seropositivity were identified, and the effect of antimalarial drugs on antibody response was determined.","Shang, Yufeng; Liu, Tao; Li, Jingfeng; Kaweme, Natasha Mupeta; Wang, Xinghuan; Zhou, Fuling",Front Immunol,382,25

Our aim was to develop a swabbing booth to address these concerns. METHODS: We developed a prototype with potential GP users using a human-centred design approach and piloted it with 10 GP clinics. The pilot was then extended to 170 GP clinics around Singapore. These GPs were then surveyed on user satisfaction. RESULTS: Ninety-three GPs (54%) responded. The majority (75%) practiced in public residential estates in small practices (mean 1.95 doctors). 86% requested the booth to enhance swabber protection. 74% “would recommend” or “would strongly recommend” the booth to colleagues. 79% continue to use the booth to conduct swab tests. 92% liked that it offered swabber protection. 71% liked that the booth created a separate space for swabbing and 64% liked its ease of disinfection. 47% started swabbing only after receiving the booth and 58% said the booth was “important” or “very important” to their decision to participate in swab testing. However, 34% disliked that it took up too much space and the most frequently critiqued area was the gloves. CONCLUSION: The human-centred design approach generated a product that had high user satisfaction, addressed GPs’ concerns of swabber protection and increased GPs’ participation in swab testing.

Patients diagnosed with severe or critical cases have a poor prognosis. Hence, it is crucial for us to identify potentially severe or critical cases early and give timely treatments for targeted patients. In the clinical practice of treating patients with COVID-19, we have observed that the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) of severe patients is higher than that in mild patients. We performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the predictive values of NLR on disease severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wanfang databases to identify eligible studies (up to August 11, 2020). Two authors independently screened studies and extracted data. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed by Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2). RESULTS: Thirteen studies involving 1579 patients reported the predictive value of NLR on disease severity. The pooled sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE) and area under curve (AUC) were 0.78 (95% CI 0.70–0.84), 0.78 (95% CI 0.73–0.83) and 0.85 (95% CI 0.81–0.88), respectively. Ten studies involving 2967 patients reported the predictive value of NLR on mortality. The pooled SEN, SPE and AUC were 0.83 (95% CI 0.75–0.89), 0.83 (95% CI 0.74–0.89) and 0.90 (95% CI 0.87–0.92), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: NLR has good predictive values on disease severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection. Evaluating NLR can help clinicians identify potentially severe cases early, conduct early triage and initiate effective management in time, which may reduce the overall mortality of COVID-19.

Methods This single-center observational study included 118 children suffering from various rheumatic diseases and receiving therapy with anti-rheumatic drugs and biological agents. In this research, we analyzed the incidence of CIVID-19 and the frequency of documented contact with SARS-CoV-2 in the period from 01.03.2020 to 11.10.2020 (32 weeks). The results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results Among 118 children, there were 28 (24%) boys and 90 (76%) girls, average age 10.3±4.2. 104 (88.2%) patients had different types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), 2 (1.6%) children had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 2 (1.6%) patients had juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM), 1 (1%) child had ANCA-associated vasculitis, 6 (5%) patients had familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), 2 (1.6%) children had deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 (DADA2), 1 (1%) child had TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS). In this group of patients 94 (79%) patients were treated with methotrexate, 1 (1%) - azathioprine, 3 (2%) patients received hydroxychloroquine, 6(5%) - mycophenolate mofetil, 4 (3%) - sulfasalazine, 14(11%) children received prednisone, 6(5%) - cyclosporine A. All children included in this study received biological agents for more than 1 year, the distribution of biological agents among patients was as follows: 41(34%) - etanercept, 33(28%) - adalimumab, 24 (20%) - tocilizumab, 7 (6%) - canakinumab, 3 (2%) - abatacept, 4 (3%) - golimumab, 6 (5%) - rituximab. Out of 118 children, 4 (3%) patients had flu-like symptoms and positive results of PCR tests for COVID-19 (1 patient was treated with etanercept, 1 - adalimumab, 1 - tocilizumab, 1 - rituximab), none of the patients had signs of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. 10 (8%) patients had documented contact with COVID-19: among this patients 2 children had flu-like symptoms, positive results of PCR tests and absence of COVID-19 pneumonia (one of this patient was treated with adalimumab, another one - with rituximab), one more patient was treated with tocilizumab and had positive PCR test without any symptoms of COVID-19; other 7 children had negative PCR tests and didn’t have any signs of COVID-19. Conclusion Among our patients with various rheumatic diseases treated with biological agents there were no registered severe cases of COVID-19. Over the past period (32 weeks of follow-up) 3% of children with COVID-19 were identified and 8% patients had documented contact with COVID-19, but we suppose it is too early to make conclusions about the degree and severity of COVID-19 among children suffering from rheumatic diseases and receiving various biological agents.

With increasing data, we can move beyond estimating aggregate effects, to understanding the effects of individual interventions. In addition to effectiveness, policy decisions ought to reflect the burden different NPIs put on the population. Methods: To our knowledge, this is the largest data-driven study of NPI effectiveness to date. We collected chronological data on 9 NPIs in 41 countries between January and April 2020, using extensive fact-checking to ensure high data quality. We infer NPI effectiveness with a novel semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model, modelling both confirmed cases and deaths to increase the signal from which NPI effects can be inferred. Finally, we study the burden imposed by different NPIs with an online survey of preferences using the MaxDiff method. Results: Six NPIs had a >97.5% posterior probability of being effective: closing schools (mean reduction in R: 58%; 95% credible interval: 50% - 64%), limiting gatherings to 10 people or less (24%; 6% - 39%), closing nonessential businesses (23%; 5% - 38%), closing high-risk businesses (19%; 1% - 34%), testing patients with respiratory symptoms (18%; 8% - 26%), and stay-at-home orders (17%; 5% - 28%). These results show low sensitivity to 12 forms of varying the model and the data. The model makes sensible forecasts for countries and periods not seen during training. We combine the effectiveness and preference results to estimate effectiveness-to-burden ratios. Conclusions: Our results suggest a surprisingly large role for schools in COVID-19 transmission, a contribution to the ongoing debate about the relevance of asymptomatic carriers in disease spreading. We identify additional interventions with good effectiveness-burden tradeoffs, namely symptomatic testing, closing high-risk businesses, and limiting gathering size. Closing most nonessential businesses and issuing stay-at-home orders impose a high burden while having a limited additional effect.","Brauner, J. M.; Sharma, M.; Mindermann, S.; Stephenson, A.

Gradually it was restarted on May 4,2020 at the beginning of the so-called phase 2, when epidemiological data showed containment of the infection. Before the outbreak in eight high-volume bariatric centers 840 patients were surgically treated developing a Covid-19 infection, during phase 1, in only 5 cases (0.6%) without mortality. The post-operative complication rate was similar when compared to the 836 subjects submitted to bariatric surgery the year before. Since the high prevalence of infection in subjects with BMI > 30, it was argued that early intervention on obesity during phase 2 could help to minimize the effects of the disease in the event of a possible reversion to a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak phase 1.

We analysed four years (2012–2015) of daily bovine transports to assess the risk of disease transmission and identify times and locations where monitoring would be most effective. Specifically, we investigated how the seasonal dynamics of transport networks, driven by the alpine summering and traditional cattle markets, affect the risk of epidemic outbreaks. RESULTS: We found strong and consistent seasonal variation in several structural network measures as well as in measures for outbreak risk. Analysis of the consequences of excluding markets, dealers and alpine pastures from the network shows that markets contribute much more to the overall outbreak risk than alpine summering. Static descriptors of monthly transport networks were poor predictors of outbreak risk emanating from individual holdings; a dynamic measure, which takes the temporal structure of the network into account, gave better risk estimates. A stochastic simulation suggests that targeted surveillance based on this dynamic network allows a higher detection rate and smaller outbreak size at detection than compared to other sampling schemes. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic measures based on time-stamped data—the outgoing contact chain—can give better risk estimates and could help to improve surveillance schemes. Using this measure we find evidence that even in a country with intense summering practice, markets continue being the prime risk factor for the spread of contagious diseases.","Vidondo, Beatriz; Voelkl, Bernhard",BMC Vet Res,382,1

The Hospital Incident Command System (HICS) is a method by which the hospital operates when an emergency is declared. Hospitals are often ill equipped to evaluate the strengths and vulnerabilities of their own management systems before the occurrence of an actual disaster. The main objective of this study was to measure the decision making performance according to HICS job actions sheets using tabletop exercises. METHODS: This observational study was conducted between May 1st 2008 and August 31st 2009. Twenty three Iranian hospitals were included. A tabletop exercise was developed for each hospital which in turn was based on the highest probable risk. The job action sheets of the HICS were used as measurements of performance. Each indicator was considered as 1, 2 or 3 in accordance with the HICS. Fair performance was determined as < 40%; intermediate as 41-70%; high as 71-100% of the maximum score of 192. Descriptive statistics, T-test, and Univariate Analysis of Variance were used. RESULTS: None of the participating hospitals had a hospital disaster management plan. The performance according to HICS was intermediate for 83% (n = 19) of the participating hospitals. No hospital had a high level of performance. The performance level for the individual sections was intermediate or fair, except for the logistic and finance sections which demonstrated a higher level of performance. The public hospitals had overall higher performances than university hospitals (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The decision making performance in the Iranian hospitals, as measured during table top exercises and using the indicators proposed by HICS was intermediate to poor. In addition, this study demonstrates that the HICS job action sheets can be used as a template for measuring the hospital response. Simulations can be used to assess preparedness, but the correlation with outcome remains to be studied.","Djalali, Ahmadreza; Castren, Maaret; Hosseinijenab, Vahid; Khatib, Mahmoud; Ohlen, Gunnar; Kurland, Lisa",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,382,23

However, due to the variety of lung nodules and the similarity of visual characteristics for nodules and their surroundings, robust segmentation of nodules becomes a challenging problem. A segmentation algorithm based on the fast marching method is proposed that separates the image into regions with similar features, which are then merged by combining regions growing with k-means. An evaluation was performed with two distinct methods (objective and subjective) that were applied on two different datasets, containing simulation data generated for this study and real patient data, respectively. The objective experimental results show that the proposed technique can accurately segment nodules, especially in solid cases, given the mean Dice scores of 0.933 and 0.901 for round and irregular nodules. For non-solid and cavitary nodules the performance dropped—0.799 and 0.614 mean Dice scores, respectively. The proposed method was compared to active contour models and to two modern deep learning networks. It reached better overall accuracy than active contour models, having comparable results to DBResNet but lesser accuracy than 3D-UNet. The results show promise for the proposed method in computer-aided diagnosis applications.","Savic, Marko; Ma, Yanhe; Ramponi, Giovanni; Du, Weiwei; Peng, Yahui",Sensors (Basel),382,26

Their robust antiviral activity is due to the strong reliance of many different viruses, including RNA viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), dengue (DENV), and Zika (ZIKV), on the IMPα/β1-virus interface. High-throughput compound screens have identified many agents that specifically target this interface. Of these, agents targeting IMPα/β1 directly include the FDA-approved macrocyclic lactone ivermectin, which has documented broad-spectrum activity against a whole range of viruses, including HIV-1, DENV1–4, ZIKV, West Nile virus (WNV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, chikungunya, and most recently, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Ivermectin has thus far been tested in Phase III human clinical trials for DENV, while there are currently close to 80 trials in progress worldwide for SARS-CoV-2; preliminary results for randomised clinical trials (RCTs) as well as observational/retrospective studies are consistent with ivermectin affording clinical benefit. Agents that target the viral component of the IMPα/β1-virus interface include N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (4-HPR), which specifically targets DENV/ZIKV/WNV non-structural protein 5 (NS5). 4-HPR has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of infection by DENV1–4, including in an antibody-dependent enhanced animal challenge model, as well as ZIKV, with Phase II clinical challenge trials planned.

Although the virus neutralization test is the gold standard assay for MERS diagnosis and for investigating the zoonotic reservoir, it uses live virus and so must be performed in high containment laboratories. Competitive ELISA (cELISA), in which a labeled monoclonal antibody (MAb) competes with test serum antibodies for target epitopes, may be a suitable alternative because it detects antibodies in a species-independent manner. In this study, novel MAbs against the spike protein of MERS-CoV were produced and characterized. One of these MAbs was used to develop a cELISA. The cELISA detected MERS-CoV-specific antibodies in sera from MERS-CoV-infected rats and rabbits immunized with the spike protein of MERS-CoV. The MAb-based cELISA was validated using sera from Ethiopian dromedary camels. Relative to the neutralization test, the cELISA detected MERS-CoV-specific antibodies in 66 Ethiopian dromedary camels with a sensitivity and specificity of 98% and 100%, respectively. The cELISA and neutralization test results correlated well (Pearson’s correlation coefficients = 0.71–0.76, depending on the cELISA serum dilution).

The aim of our study was to learn more about the experiences of German patients and staff in the oncology services. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anonymous online survey was conducted among cancer patients and their therapists (physicians, medical staff, psychologists, spiritual care givers) in Germany between April and May 2020 asking about burden, fears, and perceived changes in German oncology service system. Besides answer frequencies of different stakeholders, uni- and multivariate analyses were performed for selected items to identify areas of high impact. RESULTS: In total 752 participants were included. All groups have identified high mental burden as central problem. A majority was confused about varying information policies and strategies against the pandemic. Patient reported restricted visits, isolation and delay of treatment as central fears and problems. The majority of fears could be coped by the health care workers. The patients describe processes at the oncology services during the first wave. Personal experiences with COVID-19 have had no influence on the felt burden of the patients. Physicians, medical staff, psychologists and spiritual care givers were extremely stressed but repressed their own burden. They await financial, physical and mental problems for their own future. CONCLUSIONS: The presented personal views and experiences allow focusing the discussions about heath care systems during the on-going pandemic.

Population-based surveys for adolescent samples provide excellent opportunities for addressing the substantial burden of early-life adversities, because collecting information close in time to exposure may increase accuracy of assessment. Still few large studies have been conducted, following individuals through adolescence. Therefore, the UEVO cohort was created with the aim of investigating prevalence of child maltreatment throughout childhood and adolescence, and its effects on health and functioning in a long-term perspective in a representative sample of Norwegian adolescents. PARTICIPANTS: The baseline for the cohort includes a representative sample of 9240 Norwegian adolescents (response rate 86.6%) aged 12–16 years, surveyed in January and February 2019. The cohort to be followed over time comprises the 5502 adolescents who agreed to be recontacted for subsequent data collection waves. FINDINGS TO DATE: The overall prevalence figures from the first wave of measurement have been published in a comprehensive national report on child maltreatment in Norway. FUTURE PLANS: A second study wave will commence in 2021, including about half of the original cohort (longitudinal), as well as a new sample starting at age 12. For participants above age 16, original survey data will be connected to national registries (pending indvidual consent), enabling the study of real-life functioning within the areas of healthcare utilisation, school drop-out, work-force participation and prescription of medication.","Hafstad, Gertrud Sofie; Sætren, Sjur Skjørshammer; Myhre, Mia Cathrine; Bergerud-Wichstrøm, Marianne; Augusti, Else-Marie",BMJ Open,382,13

Evidence has been documented that the immune system is impressively involved in the pathogenesis of this disease, especially in causing inflammation. One of the important components of the immune system is the complement system whose increased activity has been shown in inflammatory diseases and consequently damage caused by the activity of its components. In the present study, serum levels of C3 and C4 factors as well as the activity level of complement system in the classical pathway were measured by CH50 test in patients with SARS-CoV-2. Participants in the study consisted of 53 hospitalized patients whose real-time PCR test was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The mean age of these patients was 42.06 ± 18.7 years, including 40% women and 60% men. The most common symptoms in these patients were cough (70%), fever (59%), dyspnea (53%) and chills (53%), respectively. Analysis of biochemical and hematological test results revealed that 26 (49%) patients had lymphopenia, 34 (64%) patients were positive for C-reactive protein (CRP) and 26 (49%) patients had ESR and LDH levels significantly higher than normal. In addition, 27 patients (51%) had vitamin D deficiency. The mean CH50 activity level in COVID-19 patients was significantly reduced compared to healthy individuals (84.9 versus 169.9 U/ml, p = < 0.0001). Comparison of the mean CH50 activity levels between different subgroups of patients indicated that COVID-19 patients with decreased peripheral blood lymphocyte count and positive CRP had a significant increase in activity compared to the other groups (p = 0.0002). The serum levels of C3 and C4 factors had no significant change between patients and healthy individuals.

Furthermore, time trends of physical functioning and optimism as well as of associations with social inequality and loneliness are analyzed. Methods: The German Ageing Survey (DEAS), a longitudinal population-based survey of individuals aged 40 years and older, was used (four waves between 2008 and 2017, total sample size N = 23,572). Physical functioning and optimism were introduced as indicators of ageing well. Educational level, net equivalent income, and loneliness were used as predictors in linear mixed models for longitudinal data. Results: Time trends show that physical functioning decreases over time, while optimism slightly increases. Education and income are positively associated with physical functioning, while higher loneliness correlates with lower physical functioning. Higher optimism was associated with higher income and particularly with lower loneliness. Income and notable educational inequalities in physical functioning increase over time. Time trends of the associations with optimism show decreasing income inequalities and increasing disparities in loneliness. Conclusions: Increasing educational inequalities in physical functioning and a strong association of loneliness with optimism provide information for further interventions. Targeted health promotion among the aged and addressing maladaptive social cognition are options to tackle these issues. Key areas for action on healthy ageing include, for instance, the alignment of health systems to the needs of older populations or the creation of age-friendly environments.","Klein, Jens; von dem Knesebeck, Olaf; Lüdecke, Daniel",Int J Environ Res Public Health,382,1

The mortality rate for critically ill patients is up to 60%, and, thus, reducing the disease severity and case mortality is a top priority. Currently, cytokine storms are considered as the major cause of critical illness and death due to COVID‐19. After a systematical review of the literature, we propose that cross‐reactive antibodies associated with antibody‐dependent enhancement (ADE) may actually be the cause of cytokine storms. It would be more difficult to develop vaccines for highly pathogenic human coronaviruses (CoVs) if ADE characteristics are taken into consideration. Therefore, it is urgent to find an effective way to prevent the occurrence of severe illness as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV‐2 specific drugs or vaccines are still in development. If the activation of memory B cells can be selectively inhibited in high‐risk patients at an early stage of COVID‐19 to reduce the production of cross‐reactive antibodies against the virus, we speculate that ADE can be circumvented and severe symptoms can be prevented. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors satisfy such needs and it is recommended to conduct clinical trials for mTOR inhibitors in preventing the severity of COVID‐19.","Zheng, Yunfeng; Li, Renfeng; Liu, Shunai",J Med Virol,382,26

Systems biology approaches promise to shed new light on the regulation of innate immunity through the analysis and modelling of these networks. A key initial step in this process is the contextual cataloguing of the components of this system and the molecular interactions that comprise these networks. InnateDB (http://www.innatedb.com) is a molecular interaction and pathway database developed to facilitate systems-level analyses of innate immunity. RESULTS: Here, we describe the InnateDB curation project, which is manually annotating the human and mouse innate immunity interactome in rich contextual detail, and present our novel curation software system, which has been developed to ensure interactions are curated in a highly accurate and data-standards compliant manner. To date, over 13,000 interactions (protein, DNA and RNA) have been curated from the biomedical literature. Here, we present data, illustrating how InnateDB curation of the innate immunity interactome has greatly enhanced network and pathway annotation available for systems-level analysis and discuss the challenges that face such curation efforts. Significantly, we provide several lines of evidence that analysis of the innate immunity interactome has the potential to identify novel signalling, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators of innate immunity. Additionally, these analyses also provide insight into the cross-talk between innate immunity pathways and other biological processes, such as adaptive immunity, cancer and diabetes, and intriguingly, suggests links to other pathways, which as yet, have not been implicated in the innate immune response. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, curation of the InnateDB interactome provides a wealth of information to enable systems-level analysis of innate immunity.","Lynn, David J; Chan, Calvin; Naseer, Misbah; Yau, Melissa; Lo, Raymond; Sribnaia, Anastasia; Ring, Giselle; Que, Jaimmie; Wee, Kathleen; Winsor, Geoffrey L; Laird, Matthew R; Breuer, Karin; Foroushani, Amir K; Brinkman, Fiona SL; Hancock, Robert EW",BMC Syst Biol,382,17

In this survey, we consider how the Data Augmentation training strategy can aid in its development. We begin with the major motifs of Data Augmentation summarized into strengthening local decision boundaries, brute force training, causality and counterfactual examples, and the distinction between meaning and form. We follow these motifs with a concrete list of augmentation frameworks that have been developed for text data. Deep Learning generally struggles with the measurement of generalization and characterization of overfitting. We highlight studies that cover how augmentations can construct test sets for generalization. NLP is at an early stage in applying Data Augmentation compared to Computer Vision. We highlight the key differences and promising ideas that have yet to be tested in NLP. For the sake of practical implementation, we describe tools that facilitate Data Augmentation such as the use of consistency regularization, controllers, and offline and online augmentation pipelines, to preview a few. Finally, we discuss interesting topics around Data Augmentation in NLP such as task-specific augmentations, the use of prior knowledge in self-supervised learning versus Data Augmentation, intersections with transfer and multi-task learning, and ideas for AI-GAs (AI-Generating Algorithms).

A total of 2315 answers were obtained, 2307 were finally analysis, as eight questionnaires were removed because of data incompleteness. 60.4% of responders declared using the face masks. Those who reported an atopic predisposition wore face masks significantly (P = .007) more commonly (65.5% and 57.7%, respectively). Cloth masks (46.2%) appeared to be most popular ones, followed by surgical masks (39.2%), respirators (N95 and FFP) (13.3%), half‐face elastomeric respirators (0.8%) and full‐face respirators (0.4%). Females significantly more frequently (P = .0001) used cloth masks; respirators, half‐face elastomeric respirators and full‐face respirators were used more commonly by males (P < .0001, P = .001 and P = .001, respectively). 23.9% of responders who used single‐use mask wore it again. Moreover, 73.6% participants declared mask decontamination; however, the procedures were not always appropriate.

M gene sequences obtained for isolates from 22 dogs with enteritis over a 5-year period were evaluated. Sequence comparison revealed that the 22 Korean CCV strains had an 87.2 to 100% nucleotide homology. Comparing to the typical reference CCV strains (type II), the nucleotide sequence of Korean strains had homology ranged from 86.3% to 98.3% (89.1% to 99.2% for the amino acid sequence) and 87.7% to 97.8% (92.4% to 100% for the amino acid sequence) when compared to FCoV-like CCV strains (type I). Three amino acid variations in the M gene were characteristic for the Korean CCV strains. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the 22 Korean CCV strains belonged to four typical CCV clusters (i.e., a unique Korean CCV cluster, a type II and transmissible gastroenteritis virus cluster, an intermediate cluster between type I and II, and a type I cluster). This study was the first to identify genetic differences of the M gene from Korean CCV strains and provided a platform for molecular identification of different Korean CCV strains.","Jeoung, Seok-Young; Ann, So-Yun; Kim, Hyun-Tae; Kim, Doo",J Vet Sci,382,16

International Microsurgery Club (IMC), as one of the largest professionals-only online microsurgery education groups worldwide, began to host regular weekend webinars during the pandemic to fill the knowledge gap. This study aims to discuss how webinars have fundamentally changed the way knowledge is delivered and exchanged. METHODS: From February 29, 2020 to March 14, 2021, 103 IMC webinars were reviewed and analyzed in detail to determine the use, benefit, and effect. A comparison between webinars hosted by the different societies was made as well. A questionnaire survey focusing on attendees' behavior, attitude, and using habit about webinars was also made. RESULTS: As for the 103 IMC webinar events, the peak participants were 112.3 people in average. The members requesting to join IMC abruptly increased during the pandemic, and the group activity increased dramatically. From the questionnaire (n = 68), the satisfaction level was high (8.88 ± 1.18/10). The respondents were most satisfied with the good quality of the speakers (73.5%). Not only hosts our webinar series but IMC also serves as the platform that welcomes webinars from other societies to share their information. In September 2020, International Microsurgery Webinar League was established via the significant webinar hosts, with more than 300 recorded webinar talks connected successfully.

Although there is a concern that ICT equipment usage may increase power consumption and emit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, ICT has also been contributing to reducing GHG emissions through improved productivity and reduced mobility. This research targeted the main ICT services used in Japan and adopted a dynamic national computable general equilibrium model to quantitatively analyze future impacts on economic growth and GHG emission reduction until 2030 by using these ICTs, while considering both the increase in power consumption of ICT itself and the reduction in environmental load in other sectors. The results showed that the spread of ICT services, especially some artificial intelligence-based services, can improve productivity in most sectors through labor-saving and contribute to improving overall gross domestic product (GDP). Additionally, increased efficiency of logistics and manufacturing can greatly reduce the input of oil and coal products and so greatly contribute to GHG emission reduction. In 2030, compared with the baseline scenario in which all technology levels are fixed at current levels, at least 1% additional GDP growth and 4% GHG emission reduction can be expected by the targeted introduction of ICT in the ICT accelerated scenario in which the technology level of ICT accelerates. This also means ICT can potentially decouple the economy from the environment.","Zhang, Xiaoxi; Shinozuka, Machiko; Tanaka, Yuriko; Kanamori, Yuko; Masui, Toshihiko",Environ Dev Sustain,382,1

In extreme situations, patients develop a dysregulated inflammatory lung injury called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that causes progressive respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilatory support. Recent studies have demonstrated immunologic dysfunction in severely ill COVID-19 patients. To further delineate the dysregulated immune response driving more severe clinical course from SARS-CoV-2 infection, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to analyze the transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from hospitalized COVID-19 patients having mild disease (n = 5), developing ARDS (n = 6), and recovering from ARDS (n = 6). Our data demonstrated an overwhelming inflammatory response with select immunodeficiencies within various immune populations in ARDS patients. Specifically, their monocytes had defects in antigen presentation and deficiencies in interferon responsiveness that contrasted the higher interferon signals in lymphocytes. Furthermore, cytotoxic activity was suppressed in both NK and CD8 lymphocytes whereas B cell activation was deficient, which is consistent with the delayed viral clearance in severely ill COVID-19 patients. Finally, we identified altered signaling pathways in the severe group that suggests immunosenescence and immunometabolic changes could be contributing to the dysfunctional immune response. Our study demonstrates that COVID-19 patients with ARDS have an immunologically distinct response when compared to those with a more innocuous disease course and show a state of immune imbalance in which deficiencies in both the innate and adaptive immune response may be contributing to a more severe disease course in COVID-19.","Yao, Changfu; Bora, Stephanie A; Parimon, Tanyalak; Zaman, Tanzira; Friedman, Oren A; Palatinus, Joseph A; Surapaneni, Nirmala S; Matusov, Yuri P; Chiang, Giuliana Cerro; Kassar, Alexander G; Patel, Nayan; Green, Chelsi ER; Aziz, Adam W; Suri, Harshpreet; Suda, Jo; Lopez, Andres A; Martins, Gislaine A; Stripp, Barry R; Gharib, Sina A; Goodridge, Helen S; Chen, Peter",medRxiv,382,11

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of the Beirut blast on the COVID-19 situation in the country. SUBJECT AND METHODS: Data on COVID-19 were retrieved from the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health (LMOPH), where all the COVID-19 positive cases were reported. The study was divided into two periods, considering the incubation period of the COVID-19 virus: (July 27–August 9, 2020) and (August 10–23, 2020). Information obtained included daily number of cases, tests, deaths, hospitalized patients, intensive care unit (ICU) patients, and mode of acquisition (local vs. expat). Daily positivity rates were reported per 100 tests. An independent sample t-test and a Joinpoint regression analysis were used to determine significance. A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: A total of 201,010 tests were conducted during our studied period, with 8993 positive cases, constituting a total positivity rate of 4.5 per 100 tests. Case fatality rate over the studied period was 0.8%. The positivity rate of the period prior to August 10, 2020, was 2.7 per 100 tests, significantly less than that of the period following the explosion, which was 6.4 per 100 tests (p < 0.001). During our studied period, daily positivity rates were significantly increasing at a slope of 0.29 (p < 0.001). A significant increase in slope was noted on August 13, 2020 (p < 0.001).

METHODS: Participants were from the UK Chronotype of Patients with type 2 diabetes and Effect on Glycaemic Control (CODEC) observational study. Participants wore an accelerometer on their wrist for 8 days before and during COVID‐19 restrictions. Accelerometer outcomes included the following: overall physical activity, moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity (MVPA), time spent inactive, days/week with ≥30‐minute continuous MVPA and sleep. Predictors of change in physical activity taken pre‐COVID included the following: age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), socio‐economic status and medical history. RESULTS: In all, 165 participants (age (mean±S.D = 64.2 ± 8.3 years, BMI=31.4 ± 5.4 kg/m(2), 45% women) were included. During restrictions, overall physical activity was lower by 1.7 mg (~800 steps/day) and inactive time 21.9 minutes/day higher, but time in MVPA and sleep did not statistically significantly change. In contrast, the percentage of people with ≥1 day/week with ≥30‐minute continuous MVPA was higher (34% cf. 24%). Consistent predictors of lower physical activity and/or higher inactive time were higher BMI and/or being a woman. Being older and/or from ethnic minorities groups was associated with higher inactive time.

The first line of defense against pathogens is the innate immune response. In the case of a viral infection, it induces the interferon (IFN) signaling cascade and eventually the expression of type I IFN, which then causes an antiviral state in the cells. However, many viruses have developed strategies to counteract this mechanism and prevent the production of IFN. In order to modulate or inhibit the IFN signaling cascade in their favor, viruses have found ways to interfere at every single step of the cascade, for example, by inducing protein degradation or cleavage, or by mediate protein polyubiquitination. In this article, we will review examples of viruses that modulate the IFN response and describe the mechanisms they use.","Schulz, Katharina S.; Mossman, Karen L.",Front Immunol,382,10

Data were analyzed from an online, cross-sectional survey administered to people (N = 1405) living in Canada and the USA in June 2020. Significant results show that respondents from Canada were felt more prepared, adapted/coped better to the pandemic, had less life disruption, fewer challenges with healthcare and financially, and were personally less affected by the pandemic than respondents from the USA. Those from Canada also showed significant higher levels of support for both their national and provincial/state leadership and belief in the necessity of preventative measures than those in the USA. Respondents from the USA were more likely to use family and friends as a source of information and as a basis for their personal preventative practices, whereas those in Canada were more likely to follow the official government recommendations. There were no significant differences in methods of coping. These results support the need for a clear role of government and for government to respond to individuals in a way that promotes equity and social justice, and thus, ensuring human rights.","Wang, Donna; Krase, Kathryn; Clarke-Jones, Annette; Roberson-Steele, Joyce; Clark-Hoey, Karen",J Hum Rights Soc Work,382,21

However, the association between multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and COVID-19 is still unknown. We review the epidemiology, causes, clinical features, and current treatment protocols for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and adolescents associated with COVID-19. We also discuss the possible underlying pathophysiological mechanisms for COVID-19-induced inflammatory processes, which can lead to organ damage in paediatric patients who are severely ill. These insights provide evidence for the need to develop a clear case definition and treatment protocol for this new condition and also shed light on future therapeutic interventions and the potential for vaccine development.

The long-term pulmonary sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are yet unknown, and comprehensive clinical follow-up data are lacking. METHODS: In this prospective, multicentre, observational study, we systematically evaluated the cardiopulmonary damage in subjects recovering from COVID-19 at 60 and 100 days after confirmed diagnosis. We conducted a detailed questionnaire, clinical examination, laboratory testing, lung function analysis, echocardiography, and thoracic low-dose computed tomography (CT). RESULTS: Data from 145 COVID-19 patients were evaluated, and 41% of all subjects exhibited persistent symptoms 100 days after COVID-19 onset, with dyspnea being most frequent (36%). Accordingly, patients still displayed an impaired lung function, with a reduced diffusing capacity in 21% of the cohort being the most prominent finding. Cardiac impairment, including a reduced left ventricular function or signs of pulmonary hypertension, was only present in a minority of subjects. CT scans unveiled persisting lung pathologies in 63% of patients, mainly consisting of bilateral ground-glass opacities and/or reticulation in the lower lung lobes, without radiological signs of pulmonary fibrosis. Sequential follow-up evaluations at 60 and 100 days after COVID-19 onset demonstrated a vast improvement of both, symptoms and CT abnormalities over time. CONCLUSION: A relevant percentage of post-COVID-19 patients presented with persisting symptoms and lung function impairment along with pulmonary abnormalities more than 100 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, our results indicate a significant improvement in symptoms and cardiopulmonary status over time.","Sonnweber, Thomas; Sahanic, Sabina; Pizzini, Alex; Luger, Anna; Schwabl, Christoph; Sonnweber, Bettina; Kurz, Katharina; Koppelstätter, Sabine; Haschka, David; Petzer, Verena; Boehm, Anna; Aichner, Magdalena; Tymoszuk, Piotr; Lener, Daniela; Theurl, Markus; Lorsbach-Köhler, Almut; Tancevski, Amra; Schapfl, Anna; Schaber, Marc; Hilbe, Richard; Nairz, Manfred; Puchner, Bernhard; Hüttenberger, Doris; Tschurtschenthaler, Christoph; Aßhoff, Malte; Peer, Andreas; Hartig, Frank; Bellmann, Romuald; Joannidis, Michael; Gollmann-Tepeköylü, Can; Holfeld, Johannes; Feuchtner, Gudrun; Egger, Alexander; Hoermann, Gregor; Schroll, Andrea; Fritsche, Gernot; Wildner, Sophie; Bellmann-Weiler, Rosa; Kirchmair, Rudolf; Helbok, Raimund; Prosch, Helmut; Rieder, Dietmar; Trajanoski, Zlatko; Kronenberg, Florian; Wöll, Ewald; Weiss, Günter; Widmann, Gerlig; Löffler-Ragg, Judith; Tancevski, Ivan",Eur Respir J,382,16

METHODS: Children (aged <18 years) who diagnosed with MIS-C and severe/critical pediatric cases with COVID-19 and were admitted to hospital between March 26 and November 3, 2020 were enrolled in the study. RESULTS: A total of 52 patients, 22 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with severe/critical disease course and 30 patients diagnosed with MIS-C, were included in the study. Although severe COVID-19 cases and cases with MIS-C share many clinical and laboratory features, MIS-C cases had longer fever duration and higher rate of the existence of rash, conjunctival injection, peripheral edema, abdominal pain, altered mental status, and myalgia than in severe cases (p<0.001 for each). Of all, 53.3% of MIS-C cases had the evidence of myocardial involvement as compared to severe cases (27.2%). Additionally, C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell (WBC) are the independent predictors for the diagnosis of MIS-C, particularly in the existence of conjunctival injection and rash. Corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and biologic immunomodulatory treatments were mainly used in MIS-C cases rather than cases with severe disease course. There were only three deaths among 52 patients, one of whom had Burkitt lymphoma and the two cases with severe COVID-19 of late referral. CONCLUSION: Differences between clinical presentations, acute phase responses, organ involvements, and management strategies indicate that MIS-C might be a distinct immunopathogenic disease as compared to pediatric COVID-19. Conjunctival injection and higher CRP and low WBC count are reliable diagnostic parameters for MIS-C cases.","Ozsurekci, Yasemin; Gürlevik, Sibel; Kesici, Selman; Akca, Ummusen Kaya; Oygar, Pembe Derin; Aykac, Kubra; Karacanoglu, Dilek; Sarıtas Nakip, Ozlem; Ilbay, Sare; Katlan, Banu; Cengiz, Ali Bülent; Basaran, Ozge; Cura Yayla, Burcu Ceylan; Karakaya, Jale; Bilginer, Yelda; Bayrakci, Benan; Ceyhan, Mehmet; Ozen, Seza",Clin Rheumatol,382,20

However, there have been few reports which evaluated the results of long-term mild intradialytic exercises in elderly patients. The purpose of this study is to investigate the changes in body weight, body composition, and laboratory data in elderly hemodialysis patients after 1-year intradialytic leg exercises with resistance bands. METHODS: A retrospective study. Twenty-one outpatients, aged 65 or older (mean ± SD, 75.2 ± 5.1 years), received intradialytic leg exercises with resistance bands for a year were analyzed. The values of dry weight, body composition, and laboratory data were collected from the year-ago period, at baseline and 1 year after baseline. Fat and muscle mass were evaluated by using a multi-frequency bioimpedance device. RESULTS: Physical performance changed and body weight increased after 1-year resistance band exercises. However, the participants gained fat mass, not muscle mass. Although the changes in biochemical data related to protein intake were equivocal, triglyceride levels increased significantly after 1-year exercises. An elevation in serum creatinine levels was observed, even if solute clearance increased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: One-year intradialytic leg exercises with resistance bands may have a potential clinical benefit for body mass index even in elderly hemodialysis patients. However, optimal dietary modification is needed to achieve a balanced increase of muscle and fat mass. An increase of serum creatinine levels does not always mean muscle mass hypertrophy.

While mental health services are seriously hampered amid this COVID-19 pandemic, health services, particularly those of Low- and Middle- Income Countries (LMICs) are looking for alternatives to provide psychosocial support to the people amid this COVID-19 and beyond. Community Health Workers (CHWs) are an integral part of the health systems in many LMICs and played significant roles such as health education, contact tracing, isolation and mobilization during past emergencies and amid COVID-19 in many LMICs. However, despite their potentials in providing psychosocial support to the people amid this COVID-19 pandemic, they have been underutilized in most health systems in LMICs. The CHWs can be effectively engaged to provide psychosocial support at the community level. Engaging them can also be cost-saving as they are already in place and may cost less compared to other health professionals. However, they need training and supervision and their safety and security needs to be protected during this COVID-19. While many LMICs have mental health policies but their enactment is limited due to the fragility of health systems and limited health care resources. CHWs can contribute in this regard and help to address the psychosocial vulnerabilities of affected population in LMICs during COVID-19 and beyond.","Mistry, Sabuj Kanti; Harris-Roxas, Ben; Yadav, Uday Narayan; Shabnam, Sadia; Rawal, Lal Bahadur; Harris, Mark F.",Front Public Health,382,16

Results Forty-seven percent of departments replied with data provided on >820 patients. Nineteen percent of additional preoperative CT was in patients undergoing elective intervention and 81% in patients presenting with surgical abdominal pain. There was a high rate of false positives in patients who tested negative for COVID-19, producing a sensitivity for thoracic CT of 68.4%. Conclusion This UK-wide audit demonstrates that a large number of additional thoracic imaging examinations over a 5-day period were performed with a low sensitivity for the identification of COVID-19 in this preoperative group of patients. Given these findings, it is difficult to justify this additional examination in this group of patients.","Callaway, M.; Harden, S.; Ramsden, W.; Beavon, M.; Drinkwater, K.; Vanburen, T.; Rubin, C.; Beale, A.",Clin Radiol,382,16

This algorithm is intended to be utilized by a large hospital or a group of coordinated hospitals at the end of each day (e.g. 8pm) when the current number of non-ventilated Covid-19 patients and the predicated number of Covid-19 admissions for tomorrow are available. The predicted number of new admissions can be replaced by the numbers of Covid-19 admissions in the previous d days (including today) for some integer d [≥] 1 when such data is available. In our simulation model that is calibrated with New York City's Covid-19 data, our predictions have consistently provided reliable estimates of the number of the ventilator-starts next day. This algorithm has been implemented through a web interface at covidvent.github.io, which is available for public usage. Utilizing this algorithm, our paper also suggests a ventilator ordering and returning policy. The policy will dictate at the end of each day how many ventilators should be ordered tonight from a central stockpile so that they will arrive by tomorrow morning and how many ventilators should be returned tomorrow morning to the central stockpile. In 100 runs of operating our ventilator order and return policy, no patients were denied of ventilation and there was no excessive inventory of ventilators kept at hospitals.","Dai, J.

This study was conducted to investigate if there was a seasonal variation in the incidence of hMPV infection in young children and possible associations between hMPV infection and local meteorological parameters in Suzhou, China. A total of 6,655 children with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) admitted to the Children’s Hospital affiliated to Soochow University, Suzhou, were tested from January 2006 to December 2009 for the presence of hMPV using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. The relationship between the presence of the virus and regional meteorological conditions was analyzed by linear and multivariate regression analysis. The overall hMPV infection incidence over the four-year study was 8.2 %, 8.1 %, 12.7 % and 7.4 % per year, respectively. Four hundred eighty-eight hMPV-positive children (78.2 %) were younger than 3 years of age. hMPV infections appear to have a seasonal distribution in Suzhou. In 2006, 2007 and 2009, the peak seasons were in December to January, while in 2008, the peak of hMPV activity occurred in May. The incidence of hMPV infection was negatively correlated with the average monthly temperature and rainfall. hMPV was one of the most common viral pathogens after respiratory syncytial virus that was associated with acute respiratory tract infection in children in Suzhou. hMPV infection occurred throughout the year with peaks during late winter and early spring. Climatic factors, especially monthly average temperature, may affect the prevalence of hMPV in Suzhou.","Wang, Yuqing; Chen, Zhengrong; Yan, Yong Dong; Guo, Hongbo; Chu, Chu; Liu, Jing; Ding, Yunfang; Shao, Xuejun; Xu, Jun; Ji, Wei",Arch Virol,382,24

Among these viruses, La Crosse virus (LACV), a member of the California serogroup, circulates in the eastern and midwestern United States. While LACV infection is often asymptomatic, dozens of cases of encephalitis are reported yearly. Unfortunately, no antivirals have been approved to treat LACV infection. Here, we developed a method to rapidly test potential antivirals against LACV infection. From this screen, we identified several potential antiviral molecules, including known antivirals. Additionally, we identified many novel antivirals that exhibited antiviral activity without affecting cellular viability. Valinomycin, a potassium ionophore, was among our top targets. We found that valinomycin exhibited potent anti-LACV activity in multiple cell types in a dose-dependent manner. Valinomycin did not affect particle stability or infectivity, suggesting that it may preclude virus replication by altering cellular potassium ions, a known determinant of LACV entry. We extended these results to other ionophores and found that the antiviral activity of valinomycin extended to other viral families including bunyaviruses (Rift Valley fever virus, Keystone virus), enteroviruses (Coxsackievirus, rhinovirus), flavirivuses (Zika), and coronaviruses (229E and MERS-CoV). In all viral infections, we observed significant reductions in virus titer in valinomycin-treated cells. In sum, we demonstrate the importance of potassium ions to virus infection, suggesting a potential therapeutic target to disrupt virus replication. Importance No antivirals are approved for the treatment of bunyavirus infection. The ability to rapidly screen compounds and identify novel antivirals is one means to accelerate drug discovery for viruses with no approved treatments. We used this approach to screen hundreds of compounds against La Crosse virus, an emerging bunyavirus that causes significant disease, including encephalitis. We identified several known and previously unidentified antivirals. We focused on a potassium ionophore, valinomycin, due to its promising in vitro antiviral activity. We demonstrate that valinomycin, as well as a selection of other ionophores, exhibits activity against La Crosse virus as well as several other distantly related bunyaviruses. We finally observe that valinomycin has activity against a wide array of human viral pathogens, suggesting that disrupting potassium ion homeostasis with valinomycin may be a potent host pathway to target to quell virus infection.","Sandler, Zachary J.; Vu, Michelle N.; Menachery, Vineet D.; Mounce, Bryan C.",bioRxiv,382,1

In previous studies, predictions were investigated for single or several countries and territories. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop models that can be applied for real-time prediction of COVID-19 activity in all individual countries and territories worldwide. METHODS: Data of the previous daily incidence and infoveillance data (search volume data via Google Trends) from 215 individual countries and territories were collected. A random forest regression algorithm was used to train models to predict the daily new confirmed cases 7 days ahead. Several methods were used to optimize the models, including clustering the countries and territories, selecting features according to the importance scores, performing multiple-step forecasting, and upgrading the models at regular intervals. The performance of the models was assessed using the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), Pearson correlation coefficient, and Spearman correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Our models can accurately predict the daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in most countries and territories.

CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Baby A underwent antiviral therapy, oxygen supplementation, and ventilation in the ICU, while baby B remained stable and confirmed negative for SARS-CoV-2. The separation surgery was conducted after baby A had become clinically stable. Defect closure and reconstruction were accomplished. At one week follow-up, Baby A died of lung infection, while baby B remained well after one year.

METHODS: An observational retrospective study was conducted using modified submental platysmal adipomyofascial flap as a locoregional reconstructive option for both intraoral and oropharyngeal defects in early-stage oral/oropharyngeal cancer patients, from Jan 2016 to May 2020 in a tertiary care hospital. All patients in this study were male and the overall flap outcome was evaluated with post-operative follow-up. RESULTS: Out of 18 patients, in 4 patients modified submental platysmal adipomyofascial flap was used as a combination of flaps for reconstruction. Six patients (33.33%) underwent adjuvant radiation therapy/radiation chemotherapy. The long-term functions (speech and swallowing) and cosmetic outcomes were good in the majority of the patients. One patient (5.55%) had pinhole oroantral fistula. No patient had any major flap failure. CONCLUSION: Modified submental platysmal adipomyofascial flap can be considered as a good alternative in male patients for reconstruction of small- to mid-sized oral cavity/oropharyngeal defects post-resection, especially during the prevailing pandemic crisis. It is an oncologically safe procedure with the major advantage of providing a hairless flap for oral cavity, tonsillar and BOT resection defects with lesser donor site morbidity.","Singh, Abhishek; Chopra, Anshu; Chaudhary, Shashank; Venkatasubramaniyan, Manikandan; Joshi, Kiran; Agarwal, Mudit",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,382,1

Despite the broad antiviral activity of IFITM3, viruses like Lassa virus (LASV), are fully resistant to its inhibitory effects. It is currently unclear whether resistance arises from a highly efficient fusion machinery that is capable of overcoming IFITM3 restriction or the ability to enter from cellular sites devoid of this factor. Here, we constructed and validated a functional IFITM3 tagged with EGFP or other fluorescent proteins. This breakthrough allowed live cell imaging of virus co-trafficking and fusion with endosomal compartments in cells expressing fluorescent IFITM3. Three-color single virus and endosome tracking revealed that sensitive (IAV), but not resistant (LASV), viruses become trapped within IFITM3-positive endosomes where they underwent hemifusion but failed to release their content into the cytoplasm. IAV fusion with IFITM3-containing compartments could be rescued by amphotericin B treatment, which has been previously shown to antagonize the antiviral activity of this protein. By comparison, virtually all LASV particles trafficked and fused with endosomes lacking detectable levels of fluorescent IFITM3, implying that this virus escapes restriction by utilizing endocytic pathways that are distinct from the IAV entry pathways. The importance of virus uptake and transport pathways is further reinforced by the observation that LASV glycoprotein-mediated cell-cell fusion is inhibited by IFITM3 and other members of the IFITM family expressed in target cells. Together, our results strongly support a model according to which IFITM3 accumulation at the sites of virus fusion is a prerequisite for its antiviral activity and that this protein traps viral fusion at a hemifusion stage by preventing the formation of fusion pores. We conclude that the ability to utilize alternative endocytic pathways for entry confers IFITM3-resistance to otherwise sensitive viruses.","Suddala, Krishna C.; Lee, Christine C.; Meraner, Paul; Marin, Mariana; Markosyan, Ruben M.; Desai, Tanay M.; Cohen, Fredric S.; Brass, Abraham L.; Melikyan, Gregory B.",PLoS Pathog,382,29

In this study, we evaluated the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the rates of PSD and PSA. METHODS: All stroke admissions to two hospitals in Saudi Arabia during two months were prospectively evaluated for PSD and PSA. NIHSS and serum TSH assessed on admission. PSD and PSA were evaluated using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Post-stroke disability was assessed by mRS, while social support assessed by Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). RESULTS: Among 50 participants (28 males), clinically significant PSD was found in 36%, while PSA in 32%. PSD associated with higher NIHSS (P < 0.001); lower MSPSS (P = 0.003); higher mRS (P = 0.001); and discontinuation of rehabilitation (P = 0.02). PSA was associated with higher TSH (P = 0.01); lower MSPSS (P = 0.03); while discontinuation of rehabilitation was related to less PSA (P = 0.034). Multivariate analysis showed that NIHSS (OR: 1.58, 95% CI: 742–3.37; P = 0.01); and MSPSS score (OR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.47–0.94; P = 0.002) were associated with PSD; while PSA was related to TSH level (OR: 8.32, 95% CI:1.42–47.23; P = 0.02), and discontinuation of rehabilitation (OR: -0.96, 95% CI: -1.90–0.02; P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our research shows that the rise in PSD is related to stroke severity and this has not changed significantly during the pandemic; however, PSA showed a noticeable peak. Social deprivation and the lacking levels of rehabilitation related significantly to both.","Ahmed, Zakaria M.; Khalil, Mohamed F.; Kohail, Ahmed M.; Eldesouky, Islam F.; Elkady, Ahmed; Shuaib, Ashfaq",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,382,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Kidney transplant recipients diagnosed with COVID‐19 from five major transplant centers in Istanbul, Turkey, were included in this retrospective cohort study. Patients were classified as having moderate or severe pneumonia for the analysis. The primary endpoint was all‐cause mortality. The secondary endpoints were acute kidney injury, the average length of hospital stay, admission to intensive care, and mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: Forty patients were reviewed retrospectively over a follow‐up period of 32 days after being diagnosed with COVID‐19. Cough, fever, and dyspnea were the most frequent symptoms in all patients. The frequency of previous induction and rejection therapy was significantly higher in the group with severe pneumonia compared to the moderate pneumonia group. None of the patients using cyclosporine A developed severe pneumonia. Five patients died during follow‐up in the intensive care unit. None of the patients developed graft loss during follow‐up. DISCUSSION: COVID‐19 has been seen to more commonly cause moderate or severe pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients. Immunosuppression should be carefully reduced in these patients. Induction therapy with lymphocyte‐depleting agents should be carefully avoided in kidney transplant recipients during the pandemic period.","Demir, Erol; Uyar, Murathan; Parmaksiz, Ergun; Sinangil, Ayse; Yelken, Berna; Dirim, Ahmet Burak; Merhametsiz, Ozgur; Yadigar, Serap; Atan Ucar, Zuhal; Ucar, Ali Riza; Demir, Mehmet Emin; Mese, Meral; Akin, Emin Baris; Garayeva, Nurana; Safak, Seda; Oto, Ozgur Akin; Yazici, Halil; Turkmen, Aydin",Transpl Infect Dis,382,0

In this study, we present client's responses to standardized questionnaires applied during the COVID-19 pandemic period as part of the strategy to measure impacts on social and sexual vulnerability, access to STI prevention services, and access to STI care. METHODS: The questionnaires included variables on sociodemographics, behavior, risk perception, prevention attitudes, barriers to service-based HIV rapid test, reasons for taking an HIV self-test, and access to health services for STI diagnosis and treatment. We explored demographic variables associated with income reduction, reduced access to HIV/STI testing/treatment and increased vulnerability to HIV/STI. RESULTS: 847 participants responded to the study questionnaire between May 2020 and January 2021. Most were young, cisgender male, and 63% self-reported as men who have sex with men. Income reductions were reported by 50%, with 30% reporting a decline over 50% of total income. An increase in heavy episodic drinking (>5 doses) was reported by 18%; 7% reported more sexual partners and 6% reported using condoms less often. Difficulties in obtaining HIV tests, tests for other STI and treatment for STI were reported by 5%, 6% and 6%, respectively. Lower schooling was significantly associated with income reduction (p = 0.004) and with reduced access to HIV/STI testing or STI treatment (p = 0.024); employment status was associated with income reduction (p < 0.001) and increased vulnerability to HIV/STI (p = 0.027). Having access to an expedite test result, avoiding physical attendance in health units during the pandemic, and undertaking the test with privacy with a trusted person were reported as motivators for HIV self-test.

METHODS: We used a web-based survey, and a convenience sampling method was adopted to collect data from 603 F-HCWs working at different hospitals in Nepal during the first week of June 2020. A self-administered questionnaire was utilized to assess the KAP perceived by the F-HCWs. It was divided into 4-parts consisting of 30-items, demographic characteristics (10-items), knowledge (10-items), attitude (5-items), and practice (5-items). It consisted of both multiple-choice questions and Likert scale items questionnaire. RESULTS: Among the participants, 76% reported adequate knowledge, 54.7% reported positive attitude, and 78.9% reported appropriate practice. Statistically significant differences regarding the perceived level of knowledge among F-HCWs were observed among independent variables, including age, gender, level of education, marital status, profession, work experience, source of information, infection prevention and control (IPC) training, and online course(p < 0.05). Similarly, statistically significant differences regarding the attitude among F-HCWs were observed among independent variables, including age, gender, level of education, profession, and online course(p < 0.05). Moreover, only 2-independent variables, including the profession and online course, showed statistically significant differences with practice(p < 0.05). Pearson correlation analysis showed a significant association between knowledge, attitude and practice at the level of p = 0.01. The factors significantly associated with adequate knowledge were male gender, nurse and doctor, websites and IPC training. Similarly, factors significantly associated with positive attitude were online course related to COVID-19 only. Moreover, factors significantly associated with appropriate practice were master’s degree or above and online course related to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: F-HCWs reported adequate overall knowledge with a positive attitude and adopted the appropriate practice. The experienced F-HCWs with higher education and who received IPC training and online course regarding COVID-19 had better KAP. So, the stakeholders must arrange the educational programs and training for F-HCWs for better preparedness tackling with COVID-19.","Tamang, Nira; Rai, Punam; Dhungana, Siddhartha; Sherchan, Binod; Shah, Bikash; Pyakurel, Prajjwal; Rai, Saroj",BMC Public Health,382,2

Methods: Adults with confirmed COVID-19 and self-reported sudden LOS were prospectively recruited through a public call from the University of Mons (Belgium). Epidemiological and clinical data were collected using online patient-reported outcome questionnaires. Patients benefited from objective olfactory evaluation (Sniffin-Sticks-test) and were invited to attend for repeated evaluation until scores returned to normal levels. Results: From March 22 to May 22, 2020, 88 patients with sudden-onset LOS completed the evaluations. LOS developed after general symptoms in 44.6% of cases. Regarding objective evaluation, 22 patients (25.0%) recovered olfaction within 14 days following the onset of LOS. The smell function recovered between the 16th and the 70th day post-LOS in 48 patients (54.5%). At the time of final assessment at 2 months, 20.5% of patients (N = 18) had not achieved normal levels of olfactory function. Higher baseline severity of olfactory loss measured using Sniffin-Sticks was strongly predictive of persistent loss (p < 0.001). Conclusion: In the first 2 months, 79.5% of patients may expect to have complete recovery of their olfactory function. The severity of olfactory loss, as detected at the first Sniffin-Sticks-test, may predict the lack of mid-term recovery.","Lechien, Jerome R.; Journe, Fabrice; Hans, Stephane; Chiesa-Estomba, Carlos M.; Mustin, Vincent; Beckers, Eline; Vaira, Luigi A.; De Riu, Giacomo; Hopkins, Claire; Saussez, Sven",Front Med (Lausanne),382,24

The aim of this study is to analyze the search interests for oral cancer using mouth cancer, tongue cancer, gum cancer, and lip cancer as common keywords. METHODS: Internet searches relating to oral cancer from 2010 to 2020, from 250 countries and dependent areas, were retrieved from Google Trends. Color densities in a heat map were used to show geographic differences. Kruskal-Wallis test with post hoc Dunn's analysis was used to perform yearly comparisons of searches for mouth cancer, tongue cancer, gum cancer, and lip cancer. Search results within 2020 were also compared to determine differences. Forecasting searches from 2021 to 2022 were done by fitting time series models. RESULTS: From 29 of 250 (11.6%) countries, the highest search values were observed for mouth cancer in Sri Lanka, Qatar, Bangladesh, Finland, Netherlands, Spain, and France. Compared to 2020, greater searches were seen in 2018 (Mdn = 91%, P = 0.023) and 2019 (Mdn = 94%, P = 0.012) for mouth cancer, and 2019 (Mdn = 17%, P = 0.035) for lip cancer. The relative search volumes for gum cancer and lip cancer were substantially lower than mouth cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Higher-income countries tend to be more interested in seeking information about oral cancer. Noteworthy decline in the interest in seeking information online for oral cancer may have crucial implications during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We investigated the impact of these restrictions on HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use among Australian gay and bisexual men (GBM). METHODS: Participants in an ongoing online cohort study previously reported PrEP use from 2014 to 2019. In April 2020, 847 HIV-negative and untested participants completed questionnaires assessing changes in PrEP use as a result of COVID-19 public health measures. Binary logistic multiple regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) to compare changes in PrEP use behaviors. RESULTS: Among 847 men, mean age was 44.1 years (SD: 12.7). PrEP use rose from 4.9% in 2015 to 47.2% in 2020. Among those, 41.8% (n = 167) discontinued PrEP use during COVID-19 restrictions. Discontinuing PrEP during COVID-19 restrictions was independently associated with being less likely to have recently tested for HIV (aOR: 0.17; 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.34; P < 0.001) and less likely to report sex with casual partners (aOR: 0.28; 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.54; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: By April 2020, following the introduction of COVID-19 restrictions, GBM dramatically reduced PrEP use, coinciding with a reduction in sexual activity. Longer-term impacts of COVID-19 restrictions on sexual behaviors among GBM need to be monitored because they may foreshadow fluctuations in prevention coverage and risk of HIV infection. Our findings indicate a potential need for clear, targeted information about resumption of PrEP and on-demand optimal dosing regimens in response to ongoing changes in restrictions.","Hammoud, Mohamed A.; Grulich, Andrew; Holt, Martin; Maher, Lisa; Murphy, Dean; Jin, Fengyi; Bavinton, Benjamin; Haire, Bridget; Ellard, Jeanne; Vaccher, Stefanie; Saxton, Peter; Bourne, Adam; Degenhardt, Louisa; Storer, Daniel; Prestage, Garrett",J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,382,28

A comprehensive review on this topic is important to highlight the areas for improvement and interventions to prevent COVID-19. Thus, the purpose of this study was to summarize the level of KAP about COVID-19 via a systematic review Methods: A systematic literature search was performed using a combination of selected keywords in four scientific databases to identify relevant literature published from January 1 to May 31, 2020. Nineteen articles were included in the systematic review, and sixteen studies in the meta-analysis. The data was analyzed using a random-effects model due to the heterogeneity between the studies. Results: Lack of COVID-19-related knowledge, positive perceptions, and preventive practices was detected and seems widespread. In particular, 56.6% (95%CI: 45.9-67%) of the health care workers (HCWs) and medical students had poor knowledge about COVID-19 and only 46% (95%CI: 15-77) of the total study sample had positive perceptions towards COVID-19. Besides, 81.7% of the sample prioritized practicing hand hygiene to prevent COVID-19, but wearing a face mask to prevent COVID-19 transmission was suboptimal (73.4%). Finally, less than a tenth (8%) of the subjects had good knowledge about COVID-19 symptoms (79%) and its transmission (82%) and reported that they avoided crowded places to prevent getting COVID-19 (89%). Conclusion: Evidence-based practices on risk communication and raising awareness should be planned by local governments in collaboration with healthcare organizations. Specifically, educational initiatives for HCWs to prioritize wearing a face mask and practicing hand hygiene should be considered a priority.","Bhagavathula, A. S.; Aldhaleei, W.

The aim of this study is to assess the effects of these protective measures on the quality of the examination with an emphasis on gender-specific differences. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: An online survey was sent to ophthalmologists in 10 countries. The collected data included demographics, place of work, current professional status, COVID-19 protective measures and their impact on the quality of the examination. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data. Fisher’s exact test was used to analyse gender differences. RESULTS: A total of 120 responses were collected. 54.0% of the respondents identified as female and 43.4% as male. Over 75% agreed that protective measures made the examination conditions more difficult. The major problems were fogging of the lenses (87.6%) or slit lamp oculars (69.9%), reduced operability of the slit lamp due to protective barriers (60.2%) and time delay due to disinfection measures (68.1%). Significantly more women than men reported that they used filtering face piece (FFP2) instead of surgical masks (p=0.02). More male participants reported that they removed their mask to prevent fogging (p=0.01). 31% of all participants felt that the COVID-19 protective measures reduced the overall quality of slit lamp examination and 43.4% reported a reduced quality of fundoscopic examination.

Flavivirus infection can result in a myriad of symptoms ranging from mild rash and flu-like symptoms, to severe encephalitis and even hemorrhagic fever. Efforts to combat the impact of these viruses have been hindered due to limited antiviral drug and vaccine development. However, the advancement of knowledge in the structural biology of flaviviruses over the last 25 years has produced unique perspectives for the identification of potential therapeutic targets. With particular emphasis on the assembly and maturation stages of the flavivirus life cycle, it is the goal of this review to comparatively analyze the structural similarities between flaviviruses to provide avenues for new research and innovation.","Nicholls, Conrrad M.R.; Sevvana, Madhumati; Kuhn, Richard J.",Adv Virus Res,382,16

Many countries including the United Kingdom have relied on the symptom-based test and trace strategy in bringing the COVID-19 pandemic under control. The effectiveness of a test and trace strategy based on symptoms has been questionable and has failed to meet testing and tracing needs. This is further exacerbated by it not being delivered at the point of care, leading to rising cases and deaths. Increases in COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United Kingdom despite performing the highest number of tests in Europe suggest that symptom-based testing and contact tracing might not be effective as a control strategy. An alternative strategy is making testing available to all. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this review was to compare mass testing and contact tracing with the conventional test and trace method in the suppression of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The secondary objective was to determine the proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases reported during mass testing interventions. METHODS: Literature in English was searched from September through December 2020 in Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Mendeley, and PubMed. Search terms included “mass testing,” “test and trace,” “contact tracing,” “COVID-19,” “SARS-CoV-2,” “effectiveness,” “asymptomatic,” “symptomatic,” “community screening,” “UK,” and “2020.” Search results were synthesized without meta-analysis using the direction of effect as the standardized metric and vote counting as the synthesis metric. A statistical synthesis was performed using Stata 14.2. Tabular and graphical methods were used to present findings. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 286 articles from Google Scholar, 20 from ScienceDirect, 14 from Mendeley, 27 from PubMed, and 15 through manual search. A total of 35 articles were included in the review, with a sample size of nearly 1 million participants. We found a 76.9% (10/13, 95% CI 46.2%-95.0%; P=.09) majority vote in favor of the intervention under the primary objective. The overall proportion of asymptomatic cases among those who tested positive and in the tested sample populations under the secondary objective was 40.7% (1084/2661, 95% CI 38.9%-42.6%) and 0.0% (1084/9,942,878, 95% CI 0.0%-0.0%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: There was low-level but promising evidence that mass testing and contact tracing could be more effective in bringing the virus under control and even more effective if combined with social distancing and face coverings. The conventional test and trace method should be superseded by decentralized and regular mass rapid testing and contact tracing, championed by general practitioner surgeries and low-cost community services.","Mbwogge, Mathew",JMIRx Med,382,26

Methods: One week after the announcement of the COVID-19 as a pandemic, in a global survey, 177 addiction medicine professionals described COVID-19-related health responses in their own 77 countries in terms of SUD treatment and harm reduction services. The health response is categorized around (1) managerial measures and systems, (2) logistics, (3) service providers, and (4) vulnerable groups. Results: Respondents from over 88% of countries reported that core medical and psychiatric care for SUDs had continued; however, only 56% of countries reported having had any business continuity plan, and 37.5% of countries reported shortages of methadone or buprenorphine supplies. Participants of 41% of countries reported partial discontinuation of harm-reduction services such as needle and syringe programs and condom distribution. 57% of overdose prevention interventions and 81% of outreach services also having been negatively impacted. Conclusions: Participants reported that SUD treatment and harm reduction services had been significantly impacted globally early during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on our findings, we provide a series of recommendations to support countries to be prepared more efficiently for future waves or similar pandemics to 1) help policymakers generate business continuity plans, 2) maintain the use of evidence-based interventions for people with SUDs, 3) be prepared for adequate medication supplies, 4) integrate harm reduction programs with other treatment modalities and 5) have specific considerations for vulnerable groups such as immigrants and refugees.","Radfar, S.

However, their significance for public health remains unclear since their seroprevalence as well as antigenic relationship with human-infecting HVs have not been investigated. In the present study archived tissues of 1,419 bats of 22 species from 6 families collected in 5 south and southwest provinces in China were screened by pan-HV RT-PCR following viral metagenomic analysis. As a result nine HVs have been identified in two bat species in two provinces and phylogenetically classified into two species, Laibin virus (LAIV, ICTV approved species, 1 strain) and Xuan son virus (XSV, proposed species, 8 strains). Additionally, 709 serum samples of these bats were also analyzed by ELISA to investigate the seroprevalence and cross-reactivity between different HVs using expressed recombinant nucleocapsid proteins (rNPs) of LAIV, XSV and Seoul virus (SEOV). The cross-reactivity of some bat sera were further confirmed by western blot (WB) using three rNPs followed by fluorescent antibody virus neutralization test (FAVNT) against live SEOV. Results showed that the total HV seropositive rate of bat sera was 18.5% (131/709) with many cross reacting with two or all three rNPs and several able to neutralize SEOV. WB analysis using the three rNPs and their specific hyperimmune sera demonstrated cross-reactivity between XSV/SEOV and LAIV/XSV, but not LAIV/SEOV, indicating that XSV is antigenically closer to human-infecting HVs. In addition a study of the distribution of the viruses identified an area covering the region between Chinese Guangxi and North Vietnam, in which XSV and LAIV circulate within different bat colonies with a high seroprevalence. A circulation sphere of bat-borne HVs has therefore been proposed.","Xu, Lin; Wu, Jianmin; Li, Qi; Wei, Yamei; Tan, Zhizhou; Cai, Jianqiu; Guo, Huancheng; Yang, Ling’en; Huang, Xiaohong; Chen, Jing; Zhang, Fuqiang; He, Biao; Tu, Changchun",PLoS Pathog,382,1

There have been no major innovations in filter technology for PPE in the past two decades. Non-woven textiles used for filtering PPE are single-use products in the healthcare environment; use and protection is focused on preventing infection from airborne or aerosolized pathogens such as Influenza A virus or SARS-CoV-2. Recently, C–H bond activation under mild and controllable conditions was reported for crosslinking commodity aliphatic polymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene. Significantly, these are the same types of polymers used in PPE filtration systems. In this report, we take advantage of this C–H insertion method to covalently attach a photosensitizing zinc-porphyrin to the surface of a melt-blow non-woven textile filter material. With the photosensitizer covalently attached to the surface of the textile, illumination with visible light was expected to produce oxidizing (1)O(2)/ROS at the surface of the material that would result in pathogen inactivation. The filter was tested for its ability to inactivate Influenza A virus, an enveloped RNA virus similar to SARS-CoV-2, over a period of four hours with illumination of high intensity visible light. The photosensitizer-functionalized polypropylene filter inactivated our model virus by 99.99% in comparison to a control.","Cuthbert, T. J.; Ennis, S.; Musolino, S. F.; Buckley, H.

Obese individuals have a higher chance of presenting periodontitis. Clinical studies in different populations demonstrate that individuals with obesity have worse periodontal conditions. This current review aims to explore recent literature to understand what the impacts of obesity on periodontal treatment outcomes are and to learn whether periodontal treatment can improve systemic biomarkers in obese individuals. RECENT FINDINGS: Short- and long-term evaluations demonstrated that non-surgical periodontal treatment could improve clinical parameters in obese individuals, represented as the reduction in mean probing depth, sites with probing depth ≥ 4 mm, and extension of bleeding on probing. However, obese individuals may have less clinical improvement when compared to normal-weight individuals with a similar periodontal profile. Additionally, periodontal treatment may contribute to a reduction in systemic levels of retinol-binding protein 4 and leptin, while promoting an increase in systemic levels of adiponectin. SUMMARY: Overall, obese individuals with periodontitis can significantly benefit from non-surgical periodontal treatment. However, clinical improvements seem to be less prominent in obese individuals with periodontitis compared to non-obese individuals with similar periodontal status. Nevertheless, periodontal treatment may impact significantly on the reduction of several biochemical biomarkers of obesity with or without weight reduction. Further investigations are needed to improve our comprehension of the mechanisms underlying those findings.","Silva-Boghossian, Carina M.; Dezonne, Romulo S.",Curr Oral Health Rep,382,20

In addition, this study verified the independent and interactive effects of playing position and contextual factors on running outputs between these teams. METHODS: Forty-eight professional male outfield soccer players participated in this study (top-ranked team, n = 24; bottom-ranked team, n = 24). The distance- and accelerometry-based measures were recorded during 69 matches using a global positioning system (10 Hz) integrated with an accelerometer (400 Hz). RESULTS: The top-ranked team covered greater total distance [median (interquartile range); 10,330.0 m (1430.0)] and high-acceleration [97.0 m (32.0)] than the bottom-ranked team, in home and away matches [p < 0.05, effect size (ES) = small]. The midfielders of the top-ranked team covered higher total distance, high-speed running (> 18 km h(−1)), high acceleration (≥ 3 m s(−2)), high-deceleration (≤ −3 m s(−2)), and performed more sprints [(> 25 km h(−1)) compared to midfielders of the bottom-ranked team (p < 0.05, η(2) = small-moderate]. The matches against top-level opponents required high values of high-acceleration and number of sprints only for the top-ranked team (p < 0.05, ES = small). Independent analysis showed that match outcome (loss vs. draw vs. win) was not influenced by running performance for both bottom- and top-ranked teams (p > 0.05; η(2) = small). However, the top-ranked team covered greater total distance, high-acceleration/deceleration than bottom-ranked team in loss matches (p < 0.05, η(2) = small).

Fresh and frozen leucocytes isolated from saliva samples (six healthy non-smoking volunteers), were exposed to four genotoxic agents inducing different types of DNA damage, both primary (methyl methanesulfonate, actinomycin-D, ultraviolet radiation) and oxidative (potassium bromate), and standard or enzyme-modified comet assay was conducted. Results were compared with those obtained from PBL. Cells exposed to the four genotoxic agents showed dose-dependent increases of primary and oxidative DNA damage, demonstrating the suitability of all these samples to detect genetic damage from different origin. When comparing baseline levels of DNA damage, just a slight significant increase in primary DNA damage was observed in frozen salivary leucocytes regarding the other biomatrices, but similar results were obtained regarding sensitivity to DNA damage induction by all agents tested. This study demonstrates that salivary leucocytes can be employed in comet assay as an alternative or complement to blood samples.

Meeting the demand for pork has forced the revolution of swine production from traditional husbandry practices that involved a few pigs or small herds to intensive concentration of swine raised in multisite production systems. This dramatic change has made the production of pork very efficient, but it has also changed the ecology of many swine diseases, may encourage the emergence of new diseases, and amplifies the economic impact of swine diseases. Sustained treatment of diseases in livestock production is not feasible making prevention of disease a priority. Prevention of livestock diseases involves eliminating exposure to pathogens and anti-viral strategies to prevent or reduce clinical disease. For some swine diseases, efficacious vaccines can be made, however, for other diseases the host/pathogen relationship is more complex and efficacious vaccines are not available. Given the increasing demand for pork, the development of new approaches to improve swine anti-viral immunity is critical. Rate-limiting steps to improving vaccines are understanding how the pathogen interacts with the host's immune system, any immunopathology resulting from such interactions and how the host's immune system resolves the infection. Solving this puzzle will require sustained research and may require new technologies to battle contemporary diseases now wreaking havoc in swine production systems around the world. This Special Issue will focus on current swine viral diseases that are the most challenging to the global production of pork with contributions focusing on anti-viral immunity.","Lager, Kelly M.; Buckley, Alexandra C.",Front Immunol,382,18

Periodic assessment of R can inform public health strategies during long-standing epidemics like the current Covid-19 situation. This is especially relevant for large and resource-poor countries like India, which may require differential intervention strategies in different regions. However, the complexity of the calculation involved often proves to be a barrier for calculation of R. This communication proposes a simpler data collection and analytical method – involving a combination approach instead of full-fledged primary data collection - to estimate R for public-health decision-making. Study design Review of literature. Methods Data from available sources (time series data of new cases at population level) can be combined with some primary data (time interval between infection of index and secondary cases in family clusters) that can be collected with little resources. These data can then be fed into an approximation-based method (Wallinga and Lipsitch) for R calculation at the state/regional levels. The calculations can be repeated every fortnight using newly available data. Results The value of R, estimated using the proposed method, from subsequent periods can be used for assessing the status of the epidemic and values from subsequent periods can be compared for decision-making regarding implementation/modification of control measures. Conclusions The approximate R may be a little inaccurate but can still prove useful for rough estimation of epidemic evolution and for comparison between different periods, as the extent of error in R values across different periods is likely to be similar. Thus, the approximate R may not only be utilized to estimate the epidemic change in smaller geographies such as states/regions but also used for making appropriate changes to public health measures for managing a pandemic like Covid-19.","Das, Aritra",Public Health,382,1

Here, using SARS-CoV-2 S protein pseudovirus system, we confirm that human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, find that SARS-CoV-2 enters 293/hACE2 cells mainly through endocytosis, that PIKfyve, TPC2, and cathepsin L are critical for entry, and that SARS-CoV-2 S protein is less stable than SARS-CoV S. Polyclonal anti-SARS S1 antibodies T62 inhibit entry of SARS-CoV S but not SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions.

Understanding the effect of such restrictions requires analysis of the role of commuting and calls for a metapopulation modeling that incorporates both local, intra-community infection and population exchange between different locations. Standard metapopulation models are formulated as markovian processes, and as such they do not label individuals according to their original location. However, commuting from home to work and backwards (reverse commuting) is the main pattern of transportation. Thus, it is important to be able to accurately model the effect of commuting on epidemic spreading. In this study we develop a methodology for modeling bidirectional commuting of individuals, without keeping track of each individual separately and with no need of proliferation of number of compartments beyond those defined by the epidemiologic model. We demonstrate the method using a city map of the state of Israel. The presented algorithm does not require any special computation resources and it may serve as a basis for intervention strategy examination in various levels of complication and resolution.

We compared the time-dependent SARS-CoV-2 viral load in serial pharyngeal swab and exhaled breath (EB) samples of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: : In this prospective proof of concept study, we examined hospitalized patients initially tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The screening consisted of collecting paired oronasopharyngeal swab and EB specimens taken at different days of hospitalization. The EB collection was performed through a noninvasive simple method using an electret air filter-based device. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was determined with qRT-PCR. RESULTS: : Of 187 serial samples taken from 15 hospitalized patients, 87 oronasopharyngeal swabs and 70 of the 100 EB specimens tested positive. Comparing the number of SARS-CoV-2 copies, the viral load of the oronasopharyngeal swabs (n=87) was significantly higher (CI 99%, p<<0,001) than the viral load of the EB samples (n=70). The mean viral load per swab was 7.97 × 10(6) (1.65 × 10(2)-1.4 × 10(8)), whereas EB samples showed 2.47 × 10(3) (7.19 × 10(1)-2.94 × 10(4)) copies per 20 times exhaling. Viral loads of paired oronasopharyngeal swab and EB samples showed no correlation. CONCLUSIONS: : Assessing the infectiousness of COVID-19 patients merely through pharyngeal swabs might not be accurate. Exhaled breath could represent a more suitable matrix for evaluating the infectiousness and might allow screening for superspreader individuals and widespread variants such as the Delta variant.","Malik, Madiha; Kunze, Ann-Cathrin; Bahmer, Thomas; Herget-Rosenthal, Stefan; Kunze, Thomas",Int J Infect Dis,382,20

This particularly concerns senior management positions whose holders may substitute hospitality jobs with more secure and rewarding employment in other economic sectors. Organisational resilience of hospitality businesses, including their response to COVID-19, and corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices may, however, affect perceived job security of senior managers and, thus, influence their commitment to remain in their host organisations. This paper quantitatively tests the inter-linkages between the above variables on a sample of senior managers in hotels in Spain. It finds that the levels of organisational resilience and the extent of CSR practices reinforce perceived job security of managers which, in turn, determines their organisational commitment. Organisational response to COVID-19 affects perceived job security and enhances managers’ organisational commitment. To retain senior management teams in light of future disastrous events, hotels should, therefore, strengthen their organisational resilience and invest in CSR.","Filimonau, Viachaslau; Derqui, Belen; Matute, Jorge",Int J Hosp Manag,382,17

Real-world data remain limited, however, and thus this analysis presents findings from over 6,500 outpatient administrations of mAb at facilities affiliated with a large healthcare organization in the United States. Within 48 hours of mAb infusion, 15.6% (1,043) of patients received a drug that was indicative of a possible reaction to the infusion; the majority of these were mild (e.g., acetaminophen). Approximately 5.2% of patients who received mAb (n=347) had a post-infusion emergency department visit or admission for COVID-19 disease progression. The results of this analysis indicate that patients who receive mAb have a low likelihood of both an immediate negative reaction to the treatment as well as future inpatient admission related to COVID-19 disease progression.","Goldin, Laurel; Elders, Ty; Werhane, Leslie; Korwek, Kimberly; Poland, Russell; Guy, Jeffrey",Int J Infect Dis,382,28

The main way of transmission is from person to person through droplet nuclei. In this time, this disease has no treatment and vaccination. Hence, the WHO recommends countries to work intensively on prevention and control measures. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the level of awareness on clinical and epidemiological spectrum of COVID-19 and factors affecting it in the North Shoa zone, Amhara Regional State, Ethiopia, 2020. METHODS: A facility-based cross-sectional study design was used to assess awareness of health professionals on COVID-19 and associated factors affecting it before and during index case. A total of 384 participants selected from 10 hospitals participated in this study. The data were entered and coded using EPI-INFO version 3.5.4 and then transferred to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression were computed. Variables with a p-value less than 0.05 were taken as predictor variables. RESULTS: A total of 384 respondents with a response rate of 91% participated in this study. The proportion of participants with an awareness of COVID-19 was 305 (79.4%). The types of profession (AOR=6.9, 95% CI=1.6–29.8) and level of a profession (AOR=2.3, 95% CI=1.4–4.4) of the profession, availability of television at home (AOR=2.1, 95% CI=1.1, 3.9) and hearing of the emerging diseases in the past (AOR=2.7, 95% CI=1.5–5) were factors that determine the awareness of health professionals on COVID-19 clinical and epidemiological spectrum. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: The level of the health professional’s awareness on the clinical and epidemiological spectrum of COVID-19 was promising. There is a need for a coordinated effort from stakeholders and health professionals to increase awareness.","Abebe, Ayele; Mekuria, Abinet; Balchut, Awraris",Infect Drug Resist,382,20

A new betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has been recognized as the responsible pathogen in this infection. Although coronavirus disease is principally expressed as a pulmonary infection, critical SARS-CoV-2 infection is frequently complicated with coagulopathy, and thromboembolic events are recognizable in several patients. Dehydration, acute inflammatory condition, protracted immobilization during disease, existence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes, obesity or hypertension, previous coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, peripheral artery disease are frequent comorbidities in SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized subjects, which possibly augment thrombo-embolic risk. However, other causal factors can still be identified such as unrestricted angiotensin II action, the use of immunoglobulins, an increased production of adhesion molecules able to induce vascular inflammation and endothelial activation, complement stimulation, excessive production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and increased platelet count. Low-molecular-weight heparin should be chosen as early treatment because of its anti-inflammatory action and its ability to antagonize histones and so defend the endothelium. However, several therapeutic possibilities have also been proposed such as fibrinolytic treatment, drugs that target NETs, and complement inhibition. Nevertheless, although the violence of the pandemic may suggest the use of heroic treatments to reduce the frightening mortality that accompanies SARS-CoV-2 infection, we believe that experimental treatments should only be used within approved and controlled protocols, the only ones that can provide useful and specify information on the validity of the treatments.","Allegra, Alessandro; Innao, Vanessa; Allegra, Andrea Gaetano; Musolino, Caterina",Ann Hematol,382,5

STUDY DESIGN: Using a nationwide sample of claims we analyzed the immediate and sustained changes in contraceptive visits during the pandemic by calculating the percentage change in number of visits between May 2019 and April 2020 and between December 2019 and December 2020, respectively. We examined these changes by contraceptive method, region, age, and use of telehealth, and separately for postpartum individuals. RESULTS: Relative to May 2019, in April 2020, visits for tubal ligation declined by 65% (95% CI, -65.5, -64.1), LARCs by 46% (95% CI, -47.0, -45.6), pill, patch, or ring by 45% (95% CI, -45.8, -44.5), and injectables by 16% (95% CI -17.2, -15.4). The sustained change in visits in December 2020 was larger for tubal ligation (-18%, 95% CI, -19.1, -16.8) and injectable (-11%, 95% CI, -11.4, -9.6) visits than for LARC (-6%, 95% CI, -6.6, -4.4) and pill, patch, and ring (-5%, 95% CI, -5.7, -3.7) visits. The immediate decline was highest in the Northeast and Midwest regions. Declines among postpartum individuals were smaller but still substantial. CONCLUSIONS: There were large declines in contraceptive visits at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and visit numbers remained below pre-pandemic levels through the end of 2020. IMPLICATIONS: Declines in contraceptive visits during the pandemic suggest that many people faced difficulties accessing this essential health service during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Steenland, Maria W; Geiger, Caroline K; Chen, Lucy; Rokicki, Slawa; Gourevitch, Rebecca A; Sinaiko, Anna D; Cohen, Jessica L",Contraception,382,20

This strategy was implemented in a context in which unintentional adolescent pregnancy continues to be a major social problem for Uruguay and the Region, necessitating comprehensive, sustained, and evidence-based public policies. In Uruguay, adolescent fertility rates have remained high for over a decade. In addition to intersectoral action by government and civil society, the strategy received scientific assistance from the academic community, and technical and financial cooperation from regional and international organizations. Its actions and measures were adopted based on a socio-ecological vision, with cultural sensitivity, a gender-transformative approach, and a human rights perspective. Major barriers include social norms that value maternity as the main life project for women living in poverty, gender stereotypes (pregnancy as the exclusive responsibility of adolescent girls, without involving adolescent boys), the stigma of abortion, a lack of sexual and reproductive health services, and resistance to raising the visibility of pregnancy in girls under 15 years of age who are victims of structural and family violence.

For example, default strategies and accountable justification strategies have improved adherence to best practices in clinical settings. Embedding such strategies in the electronic health record (EHR) holds promise for simple and scalable approaches to facilitating implementation. A proven-effective but under-utilized treatment for patients who undergo mechanical ventilation involves prescribing low tidal volumes, which protects the lungs from injury. We will evaluate EHR-based implementation strategies grounded in behavioral economic theory to improve evidence-based management of mechanical ventilation. METHODS: The Implementing Nudges to Promote Utilization of low Tidal volume ventilation (INPUT) study is a pragmatic, stepped-wedge, hybrid type III effectiveness implementation trial of three strategies to improve adherence to low tidal volume ventilation. The strategies target clinicians who enter electronic orders and respiratory therapists who manage the mechanical ventilator, two key stakeholder groups. INPUT has five study arms: usual care, a default strategy within the mechanical ventilation order, an accountable justification strategy within the mechanical ventilation order, and each of the order strategies combined with an accountable justification strategy within flowsheet documentation. We will create six matched pairs of twelve intensive care units (ICUs) in five hospitals in one large health system to balance patient volume and baseline adherence to low tidal volume ventilation. We will randomly assign ICUs within each matched pair to one of the order panels, and each pair to one of six wedges, which will determine date of adoption of the order panel strategy. All ICUs will adopt the flowsheet documentation strategy 6 months afterwards. The primary outcome will be fidelity to low tidal volume ventilation. The secondary effectiveness outcomes will include in-hospital mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital length of stay, and occurrence of potential adverse events. DISCUSSION: This stepped-wedge, hybrid type III trial will provide evidence regarding the role of EHR-based behavioral economic strategies to improve adherence to evidence-based practices among patients who undergo mechanical ventilation in ICUs, thereby advancing the field of implementation science, as well as testing the effectiveness of low tidal volume ventilation among broad patient populations.

COVID-19 poses a serious threat to human life. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are diverse and severe and 20% of infected patients are reported to be in a critical condition. A loss in lung function and pulmonary fibrosis are the main manifestations of patients with the severe form of the disease. The lung function is affected, even after recovery, thereby greatly affecting the psychology and well-being of patients, and significantly reducing their quality of life. METHODS: Participants must meet the following simultaneous inclusion criteria: over 18 years of age, should have recovered from severe or critical COVID-19 cases, should exhibit pulmonary fibrosis after recovery, and should exhibit Qi-Yin deficiency syndrome as indicated in the system of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). The eligible candidates will be randomized into treatment or control groups. The treatment group will receive modern medicine (pirfenidone) plus TCM whereas the control group will be administered modern medicine plus TCM placebo. The lung function index will be continuously surveyed and recorded. By comparing the treatment effect between the two groups, the study intend to explore whether TCM can improve the effectiveness of modern medicine in patients with pulmonary fibrosis arising as a sequelae after SARS-CoV-2 infection. DISCUSSION: Pulmonary fibrosis is one of fatal sequelae for some severe or critical COVID-19 cases, some studies reveal that pirfenidone lead to a delay in the decline of forced expiratory vital capacity, thereby reducing the mortality partly. Additionally, although TCM has been proven to be efficacious in treating pulmonary fibrosis, its role in treating pulmonary fibrosis related COVID-19 has not been explored. Hence, a multicenter, parallel-group, randomized controlled, interventional, prospective clinical trial has been designed and will be conducted to determine if a new comprehensive treatment for pulmonary fibrosis related to COVID-19 is feasible and if it can improve the quality of life of patients. Trial registration: This multicenter, parallel-group, randomized controlled, interventional, prospective trial was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2000033284) on 26th May 2020 (prospective registered).

ABSTRACT: Microbes, including bacteria and fungi, easily form stable biofilms on many surfaces. Such biofilms have high resistance to antibiotics, and cause nosocomial and postoperative infections. The antimicrobial and antiviral behaviors of Ag and Cu nanoparticles (NPs) are well known, and possible mechanisms for their actions, such as released ions, reactive oxygen species (ROS), contact killing, the immunostimulatory effect, and others have been proposed. Ag and Cu NPs, and their derivative NPs, have different antimicrobial capacities and cytotoxicities. Factors, such as size, shape and surface treatment, influence their antimicrobial activities. The biomedical application of antimicrobial Ag and Cu NPs involves coating onto substrates, including textiles, polymers, ceramics, and metals. Because Ag and Cu are immiscible, synthetic AgCu nanoalloys have different microstructures, which impact their antimicrobial effects. When mixed, the combination of Ag and Cu NPs act synergistically, offering substantially enhanced antimicrobial behavior. However, when alloyed in Ag–Cu NPs, the antimicrobial behavior is even more enhanced. The reason for this enhancement is unclear. Here, we discuss these results and the possible behavior mechanisms that underlie them.","Fan, Xinzhen; Yahia, L’Hocine; Sacher, Edward",Biology (Basel),382,1

However, the impacts of specific state-level policies on mobility and subsequent COVID-19 case trajectories have not been completely quantified. Using anonymized and aggregated mobility data from opted-in Google users, we found that state-level emergency declarations resulted in a 9.9% reduction in time spent away from places of residence. Implementation of one or more social distancing policies resulted in an additional 24.5% reduction in mobility the following week, and subsequent shelter-in-place mandates yielded an additional 29.0% reduction. Decreases in mobility were associated with substantial reductions in case growth two to four weeks later. For example, a 10% reduction in mobility was associated with a 17.5% reduction in case growth two weeks later. Given the continued reliance on social distancing policies to limit the spread of COVID-19, these results may be helpful to public health officials trying to balance infection control with the economic and social consequences of these policies.","Wellenius, Gregory A.; Vispute, Swapnil; Espinosa, Valeria; Fabrikant, Alex; Tsai, Thomas C.; Hennessy, Jonathan; Dai, Andrew; Williams, Brian; Gadepalli, Krishna; Boulanger, Adam; Pearce, Adam; Kamath, Chaitanya; Schlosberg, Arran; Bendebury, Catherine; Mandayam, Chinmoy; Stanton, Charlotte; Bavadekar, Shailesh; Pluntke, Christopher; Desfontaines, Damien; Jacobson, Benjamin H.; Armstrong, Zan; Gipson, Bryant; Wilson, Royce; Widdowson, Andrew; Chou, Katherine; Oplinger, Andrew; Shekel, Tomer; Jha, Ashish K.; Gabrilovich, Evgeniy",Nat Commun,382,26

METHODS: A total of 413 older adults with a mean age of 57.72 (SD = 7.31) were recruited for this study. They responded to the measures on fear of COVID-19, insomnia, mental health, and COVID-19 preventive behaviors. RESULTS: There were small-large significant interrelationships between insomnia, mental health, fear of COVID-19, and preventive behaviors. Fear of COVID-19 significantly mediated the associations between perceived health status and insomnia, mental health, and COVID-19 preventive behaviors. It was also observed that perceived health status directly influenced insomnia and mental health of older adults but not their COVID-19 preventive behaviors. CONCLUSION: Fear of COVID-19 has an important role to play in the management of the health and preventive behaviors of older adults. Health experts and communicators may capitalize on these findings to educate people on COVID-19. Future studies are needed to perfectly ascertain the extent of fear needed to stimulate or initiate better preventive behaviors and healthcare practices.","Ahorsu, Daniel Kwasi; Lin, Chung-Ying; Pakpour, Amir H.",Gerontol Geriatr Med,382,29

Bats, remarkably, are the natural reservoirs of many of the most pathogenic viruses in humans. There are two bat genome projects currently underway, a circumstance that promises to speed the discovery host factors important in the coevolution of bats with their viruses. These genomes, however, are not yet assembled and one of them will provide only low coverage, making the inference of most genes of immunological interest error-prone. Many more wildlife genome projects are underway and intend to provide only shallow coverage. RESULTS: We have developed a statistical method for the assembly of gene families from partial genomes. The method takes full advantage of the quality scores generated by base-calling software, incorporating them into a complete probabilistic error model, to overcome the limitation inherent in the inference of gene family members from partial sequence information. We validated the method by inferring the human IFNA genes from the genome trace archives, and used it to infer 61 type-I interferon genes, and single type-II interferon genes in the bats Pteropus vampyrus and Myotis lucifugus. We confirmed our inferences by direct cloning and sequencing of IFNA, IFNB, IFND, and IFNK in P. vampyrus, and by demonstrating transcription of some of the inferred genes by known interferon-inducing stimuli. CONCLUSION: The statistical trace assembler described here provides a reliable method for extracting information from the many available and forthcoming partial or shallow genome sequencing projects, thereby facilitating the study of a wider variety of organisms with ecological and biomedical significance to humans than would otherwise be possible.","Kepler, Thomas B; Sample, Christopher; Hudak, Kathryn; Roach, Jeffrey; Haines, Albert; Walsh, Allyson; Ramsburg, Elizabeth A",BMC Genomics,382,16

To this end, we computationally investigated the MPD3 phytochemical database along with the pool of reported natural antiviral compounds with potential to be used as anti-SARS-CoV-2. The docking results demonstrated glycyrrhizin followed by azadirachtanin, mycophenolic acid, kushenol-w and 6-azauridine, as potential candidates. Glycyrrhizin depicted very stable binding mode to the active pocket of the Mpro (binding energy, −8.7 kcal/mol), PLpro (binding energy, −7.9 kcal/mol), and Nucleocapsid (binding energy, −7.9 kcal/mol) enzymes. This compound showed binding with several key residues that are critical to natural substrate binding and functionality to all the receptors. To test docking prediction, the compound with each receptor was subjected to molecular dynamics simulation to characterize the molecule stability and decipher its possible mechanism of binding. Each complex concludes that the receptor dynamics are stable (Mpro (mean RMSD, 0.93 Å), PLpro (mean RMSD, 0.96 Å), and Nucleocapsid (mean RMSD, 3.48 Å)). Moreover, binding free energy analyses such as MMGB/PBSA and WaterSwap were run over selected trajectory snapshots to affirm intermolecular affinity in the complexes. Glycyrrhizin was rescored to form strong affinity complexes with the virus enzymes: Mpro (MMGBSA, −24.42 kcal/mol and MMPBSA, −10.80 kcal/mol), PLpro (MMGBSA, −48.69 kcal/mol and MMPBSA, −38.17 kcal/mol) and Nucleocapsid (MMGBSA, −30.05 kcal/mol and MMPBSA, −25.95 kcal/mol), were dominated mainly by vigorous van der Waals energy. Further affirmation was achieved by WaterSwap absolute binding free energy that concluded all the complexes in good equilibrium and stability (Mpro (mean, −22.44 kcal/mol), PLpro (mean, −25.46 kcal/mol), and Nucleocapsid (mean, −23.30 kcal/mol)). These promising findings substantially advance our understanding of how natural compounds could be shaped to counter SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Muhseen, Ziyad Tariq; Hameed, Alaa R.; Al-Hasani, Halah M.

This study aimed to investigate spatiotemporal patterns of mortality due to these diseases in Tehran between 2008 and 2018. METHODS: We used a dataset available from Tehran Municipality including all cases deceased due RSDs in this city between 2008 and 2018. Global Moran’s I was performed to test whether the age-adjusted mortality rates were randomly distributed or had a spatial pattern. Furthermore, Anselin Local Moran’s I was conducted to identify potential clusters and outliers. RESULTS: During the 10-year study, 519,312 people died in Tehran, 43,177 because of RSDs, which corresponds to 831.1 per 10,000 deaths and 5.0 per 10,000 population. The death rate was much higher in men (56.8%) than in women (43.2%) and the highest occurred in the > 65 age group (71.2%). Overall, three diseases dominated the mortality data: respiratory failure (44.2%), pneumonia (15.9%) and lung cancer (10.2%). The rates were significantly higher in the central and southeastern parts of the city and lower in the western areas. It increased during the period 2008–2018 and showed a clustered spatial pattern between 2008 and 2013 but presented a random geographical pattern afterwards. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a first report of the spatial distribution of mortality due to RSDs in Tehran and shows a significant increase in respiratory disease mortality in the last ten years.

Methods: A population-based sample of cases and close contacts from the Zurich SARS-CoV-2 Cohort was surveyed regarding SwissCovid app use and SARS-CoV-2 exposure. We descriptively analyzed app adherence and effectiveness, and evaluated its effects on the time between exposure and quarantine among contacts using stratified multivariable time-to-event analyses. Results: We included 393 SARS-CoV-2 infected cases and 261 close contacts. 62% of cases reported using SwissCovid and among those, 88% received and uploaded a notification code. 71% of close contacts were app users, of which 38% received a warning. Non-household contacts notified by SwissCovid started quarantine 1 day earlier and were more likely to quarantine earlier than those not warned by the app (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.15–2.03). Conclusion: These findings provide evidence that DPT may reach exposed contacts faster than MCT, with earlier quarantine and potential interruption of SARS-CoV-2 transmission chains.","Ballouz, Tala; Menges, Dominik; Aschmann, Hélène E.; Domenghino, Anja; Fehr, Jan S.; Puhan, Milo A.; von Wyl, Viktor",Int J Public Health,382,16

To date, 38 patients required hospitalization while 9 remained self-home quarantined and 14 died. Compared to the general population, prevalence (18 vs 7 cases per 1000) and related case fatality rate (29.7 vs 15.4%) in heart transplant recipients were doubled. Univariable analysis showed older age (p=0.002), diabetes mellitus (p=0.040), extracardiac arteriopathy (p=0.040), previous PCI (p=0.040), CAV score (p=0.039), lower GFR (p=0.004), and higher NYHA classes (p=0.023) were all significantly associated with in-hospital mortality.

In this study, we elucidate whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) stimulates autoantibody production and contributes to autoimmunity activation. We enrolled 40 adult patients (66.8 years mean age) admitted to Alessandria Hospital between March and April 2020. All the patients had a confirmed COVID‐19 diagnosis and no previously clinical record of autoimmune disease. Forty blood donors were analyzed for the same markers and considered as healthy controls. Our patients had high levels of common inflammatory markers, such as C reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, and creatinine. Interleukin‐6 concentrations were also increased, supporting the major role of this interleukin during COVID‐19 infection. Lymphocyte numbers were generally lower compared with healthy individuals. All the patients were also screened for the most common autoantibodies. We found a significant prevalence of antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and ASCA immunoglobulin A antibodies. We observed that patients having a de novo autoimmune response had the worst acute viral disease prognosis and outcome. Our results sustain the hypothesis that COVID‐19 infection correlates with the autoimmunity markers. Our study might help clinicians to: (a) better understand the heterogeneity of this pathology and (b) correctly evaluate COVID‐19 clinical manifestations. Our data explained why drugs used to treat autoimmune diseases may also be useful for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. In addition, we highly recommend checking patients with COVID‐19 for autoimmunity markers, mainly when deciding on whether to treat them with plasma transfer therapy. STUDY HIGHLIGHTS: WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC? WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS? WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE? HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE? ☑ These results suggest that the drugs normally used to treat autoimmune diseases should also be considered during SARS‐CoV‐2, improving public health. In addition, before starting a transfer plasma therapy, it is important to also evaluate the autoimmunity conditions of the patients with COVID‐19. Transferring antibodies or trying to neutralize them should be done with precaution. It is possible that the risk of developing or increasing the autoimmune response may enhance.","Sacchi, Maria C.; Tamiazzo, Stefania; Stobbione, Paolo; Agatea, Lisa; De Gaspari, Piera; Stecca, Anna; Lauritano, Ernesto C.; Roveta, Annalisa; Tozzoli, Renato; Guaschino, Roberto; Bonometti, Ramona",Clin Transl Sci,382,20

When seeking a new PCP, patients want to know not only educational credentials but also providers’ communication traits, and personal information to showcase providers as real people. Offering this information, to help patients find providers best suited to meet their needs, is a key attribute of patient-centered care. OBJECTIVE: To analyze whether health systems’ online PCP biographies are including the information prospective patients deem important when selecting a PCP. DESIGN: Using the AHRQ’s Compendium of US Health Systems, 523 health systems’ PCP biographies were content analyzed (n = 5004 biographies) from December 2019 to March 2020. MAIN MEASURES: Forty-eight unique pieces of information were coded for either their presence or absence (e.g., education, photo, languages spoken, insurance accepted, patient reviews, philosophy of care, video provided, personal hobbies/interests). Providers’ alphabetic credentials (e.g., MD, DO, APRN) were also documented. KEY RESULTS: The majority of biographies stated the provider’s medical education (83.6%) and included a photo (81.4%). However, information patients also desire (e.g., communication traits and personal information) were less prevalent. Only 33.7% listed languages spoken, 18.2% offered patient reviews, 14.4% had personal hobbies/interests, and 10.6% included a video. There were also 192 unique alphabetic credential combinations listed next to providers’ names. Two health systems clearly included information within biographies to help prospective patients understand what these credentials meant. CONCLUSIONS: Health systems could make simple changes to their providers’ online biographies in order to help patients make more informed decisions of PCPs. Doing so may decrease doctor shopping, and also lead to a greater likelihood of developing longer-term relationships with PCPs.","Perrault, Evan K.; Barton, Jessie A.; Adu Gyamfi, Prince",J Gen Intern Med,382,1

While common in developing nations, it is unusual in the United Kingdom. We present the first United Kingdom case series and discuss its potential role during and after this pandemic. Methods We prospectively studied patients with appendicitis at a British district general hospital who were unsuitable for conservative management and consequently underwent open appendicectomy under SA. We also reviewed patient satisfaction after 30 days. This ran for 5 weeks from March 25th, 2020 until the surgical department reverted to the laparoscopic appendicectomy as the standard of care. Main outcomes were 30-day complication rates and patient satisfaction. Results None of the included seven patients were COVID positive. The majority (four-sevenths) had complicated appendicitis. There were no major adverse (Clavien-Dindo grade III to V) postoperative events. Two patients suffered minor postoperative complications. Two experienced intraoperative pain. Mean operative time was 44 minutes. Median length of stay and return to activity was 1 and 14 days, respectively. Although four stated preference in hindsight for GA, the majority (five-sevenths) were satisfied with the operative experience under SA. Discussion Although contraindications, risk of pain, and specific complications may be limiting, our series demonstrates open appendicectomy under SA to be safe and feasible in the United Kingdom.

DESIGN Applying an exploratory longitudinal design, participants (N = 431) from Germany and Austria completed surveys in April/May 2020 (T1) and July/August 2020 (T2). MEASURES Three outcome measures operationalised compliance with public health guidelines at T2: self-reported adherence (behavioural), agreement and opposition (attitudinal). At T1, demographics, perceived distress (PHQ-4, crisis of meaning), resources (self-control, meaningfulness), locus of control, conspiracy mentality and social media use were assessed. At T2, situational variables were added (person at risk, infection of close person, fear of infection, COVID-19 stress). Temporal shifts from T1 to T2 were examined as complementary information. RESULTS An attitude-behaviour gap at T2 was identified, as agreement with and opposition to the guidelines were only modestly correlated with adherence to them. Measures of personal concern (fear of infection, person at risk) were associated with both adherence and positive attitudes towards the measures. COVID-19 stress and conspiracy mentality predicted negative attitudes, but not adherence. Age predicted adherence positively, social media use negatively. CONCLUSION The findings support the significance of personal concern for compliance with public health guidelines and suggest a critical impact of social media use and conspiracy mentality.","Schnell, Tatjana; Spitzenstätter, Daniel; Krampe, Henning",Psychology & health,382,33

SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic strategies were reported to have a high false-negative rate and low sensitivity due to low viral antibodies or antigenic load in the specimens, that is why even PCR test is recommended to be repeated to overcome this problem. Thus, in anticipation of COVID-19 current wave and the upcoming waves, we should have an accurate and rapid diagnostic tool to control this pandemic. In this study, we developed a novel preanalytical strategy to be used for SARS-CoV-2 specimen enrichment to avoid misdiagnosis. This method depends on the immuno-affinity trapping of the viral target followed by in situ thermal precipitation and enrichment. We designed, synthesized, and characterized a thermal-responsive polymer poly (N-isopropylacrylamide-co-2-hydroxyisopropylacrylamide-co-strained alkyne isopropylacrylamide) followed by decoration with SARS-CoV-2 antibody. Different investigations approved the successful synthesis of the polymeric antibody conjugate. This conjugate was shown to enrich recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein samples to about 6 folds. This developed system succeeded in avoiding the misdiagnosis of low viral load specimens using the lateral flow immunoassay test. The strength of this work is that, to the best of our knowledge, this report may be the first to functionalize SARS-CoV-2 antibody to a thermo-responsive polymer for increasing its screening sensitivity during the current pandemic.","Nabil, Ahmed; Yoshihara, Erika; Hironaka, Keita; Hassan, Ayman A.; Shiha, Gamal; Ebara, Mitsuhiro",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,382,16

For vesicular stomatitis virus, conserved region VI in the large (L) polymerase protein catalyzes both guanine-N-7 (G-N-7) and ribose 2'-O (2'-O) methyltransferases, and the two methylases share a binding site for the methyl donor S-adenosyl-l-methionine. Unlike conventional mRNA cap methylation, the 2'-O methylation of VSV precedes subsequent G-N-7 methylation. In this study, we found that individual alanine substitutions in two conserved aromatic residues (Y1650 and F1691) in region VI of L protein abolished both G-N-7 and 2'-O methylation. However, replacement of one aromatic residue with another aromatic residue did not significantly affect the methyltransferase activities. Our studies provide genetic and biochemical evidence that conserved aromatic residues in region VI of L protein essential for both G-N-7 and 2'-O methylations. In combination with the structural prediction, our results suggest that these aromatic residues may participate in RNA recognition.","Zhang, Xiaodong; Wei, Yongwei; Ma, Yuanmei; Hu, Songhua; Li, Jianrong",Virology,382,33

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 122 patients (61 men and 61 women, 48 ± 15 years) confirmed with COVID-19 and 48 patients (23 men and 25 women, 47 ± 19 years) confirmed with influenza were enrolled in the study. Thin-section CT was performed. The clinical data and the chest CT findings were recorded. RESULTS: The most common symptoms of COVID-19 were fever (74%) and cough (63%), and 102 patients (83%) had Wuhan contact. Pneumonia in 50 patients with COVID-19 (45%) distributed in the peripheral regions of the lung, while it showed mixed distribution in 26 patients (74%) with influenza (p = 0.022). The most common CT features of the COVID-19 group were pure ground-glass opacities (GGO, 36%), GGO with consolidation (51%), rounded opacities (35%), linear opacities (64%), bronchiolar wall thickening (49%), and interlobular septal thickening (66%). Compared with the influenza group, the COVID-19 group was more likely to have rounded opacities (35% vs. 17%, p = 0.048) and interlobular septal thickening (66% vs. 43%, p = 0.014), but less likely to have nodules (28% vs. 71%, p < 0.001), tree-in-bud sign (9% vs. 40%, p < 0.001), and pleural effusion (6% vs. 31%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in the CT manifestations of patients with COVID-19 and influenza. Presence of rounded opacities and interlobular septal thickening, with the absence of nodules and tree-in-bud sign, and with the typical peripheral distribution, may help us differentiate COVID-19 from influenza. KEY POINTS: • Typical CT features of COVID-19 include pure ground-glass opacities (GGO), GGO with consolidation, rounded opacities, bronchiolar wall thickening, interlobular septal thickening, and a peripheral distribution. • Presence of rounded opacities and interlobular septal thickening, with the absence of nodules and tree-in-bud sign, and with the typical peripheral distribution, may help us differentiate COVID-19 from influenza.","Liu, Mengqi; Zeng, Wenbin; Wen, Yun; Zheng, Yineng; Lv, Fajin; Xiao, Kaihu",Eur Radiol,382,26

When the body needs energy, the lipid is broken down into glycerol (G) and free fatty acids (FFA) during the lipolysis process and transferred to various tissues in the body. Materials secreted from AT, especially adipocytokines (interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), are impressive in causing inflammation and OS of AT. There are several ways to improve obesity, but researchers have highly regarded the use of antioxidant supplements due to their neutralizing properties in removing ROS. In this review, we have examined the AT response to OS to antioxidant supplements focusing on animal studies. The results are inconsistent due to differences in the study duration and diversity in animals (strain, age, and sex).

This viral disease primarily causes lung pneumonia and has a wide range of clinical manifestations. The severity of infection ranges from those who are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms which do not require hospital admission, to those who require ventilator support and eventually die, depending on immunity, age and other comorbidities existing with the patients. The present report is an attempt to study the effect of physiological and environmental factors existing at high altitudes (HA) with spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of existing data revealed that HA natives do possess certain physiological advantages such as (1) improved hypoxic ventilatory response, (2) higher concentration of oxygen carrying molecules, haemoglobin, (3) increased production of Vitamin D, due to intense solar radiation, (4) lower rates of comorbidities such as lung infections, obesity etc. and (5) most importantly reduced production of angiotensin converting enzyme 2, a carrier molecule for SARS-CoV-2 virus entry into the host cell; all of which can collectively account for improved tolerance to SARS-CoV-2 infection in HA natives. In addition, environmental factors at HA such as (6) dry and chilly winds, (7) low air density and (8) intense UV radiations may further inhibit viral growth and spread into the atmosphere. We thus conclude that, high altitude natives may posses physiological and environmental advantage over low landers in terms of reduced severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its limited spread.

Initially, CT imaging was demonstrated to be one of the most sensitive tests for the detection of infection. Currently, with broader availability of polymerase chain reaction for disease diagnosis, CT is mainly used for the identification of complications and other defined clinical indications in hospitalized patients. Nonetheless, radiologists are interpreting lung imaging in unsuspected patients as well as in suspected patients with imaging obtained to rule out other relevant clinical indications. The knowledge of pathological findings is also crucial for imagers to better interpret various imaging findings. Identification of the imaging findings that are commonly seen with the disease is important to diagnose and suggest confirmatory testing in unsuspected cases. Proper precautionary measures will be important in such unsuspected patients to prevent further spread. In addition to understanding the imaging findings for the diagnosis of the disease, it is important to understand the growing set of tools provided by artificial intelligence. The goal of this review is to highlight common imaging findings using illustrative examples, describe the evolution of disease over time, discuss differences in imaging appearance of adult and pediatric patients and review the available literature on quantitative CT for COVID-19. We briefly address the known pathological findings of the COVID-19 lung disease that may help better understand the imaging appearance, and we provide a demonstration of novel display methodologies and artificial intelligence applications serving to support clinical observations.","Nagpal, Prashant; Narayanasamy, Sabarish; Vidholia, Aditi; Guo, Junfeng; Shin, Kyung Min; Lee, Chang Hyun; Hoffman, Eric A",Br J Radiol,382,2

However, the molecular basis of the mechanism by which this mutation enhances fitness is not clear. Here we demonstrated by cryo-electron microscopy that the D614G mutation resulted in increased propensity of multiple receptor binding domains (RBDs) in an upward conformation poised for host receptor binding. Multiple substates within the one RBD-up or two RBD-up conformational space were determined. According to negative staining electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and differential scanning fluorimetry, the most significant impact of the mutation lies in its ability to eliminate the unusual cold-induced unfolding characteristics, and to significantly increase the thermal stability under physiological pH. The D614G spike variant also exhibited exceptional long-term stability when stored at 37 ºC for up to two months. Our findings shed light on how the D614G mutation enhances the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 through a stabilizing mutation, and suggest an approach for better design of spike protein-based conjugates for vaccine development.","Yang, Tzu-Jing; Yu, Pei-Yu; Chang, Yuan-Chih; Hsu, Shang-Te Danny",J Biol Chem,382,12

The etiology of SSc remains quite obscure; it may encompass multiple host genetic and environmental -infectious/chemical-factors. The present review focused on the potential role of environmental agents in the etiopathogenesis of SSc based on epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory investigations previously published in the world literature. Among infectious agents, some viruses that may persist and reactivate in infected individuals, namely human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6), and parvovirus B19 (B19V), and retroviruses have been proposed as potential causative agents of SSc. These viruses share a number of biological activities and consequent pathological alterations, such as endothelial dysfunction and/or fibroblast activation. Moreover, the acute worsening of pre-existing interstitial lung involvement observed in SSc patients with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection might suggest a potential role of this virus in the overall disease outcome. A variety of chemical/occupational agents might be regarded as putative etiological factors of SSc. In this setting, the SSc complicating silica dust exposure represents one of the most promising models of study. Considering the complexity of SSc pathogenesis, none of suggested causative factors may explain the appearance of the whole SSc; it is likely that the disease is the result of a multifactorial and multistep pathogenetic process. A variable combination of potential etiological factors may modulate the appearance of different clinical phenotypes detectable in individual scleroderma patients. The in-deep investigations on the SSc etiopathogenesis may provide useful insights in the broad field of human diseases characterized by diffuse microangiopathy or altered fibrogenesis.","Ferri, Clodoveo; Arcangeletti, Maria-Cristina; Caselli, Elisabetta; Zakrzewska, Krystyna; Maccari, Clara; Calderaro, Adriana; D'Accolti, Maria; Soffritti, Irene; Arvia, Rosaria; Sighinolfi, Gianluca; Artoni, Erica; Giuggioli, Dilia",J Autoimmun,382,22

Our aim is to describe patient experience with their current and prior treatments and discuss factors they consider when choosing a treatment. METHODS: Twenty-one women with IC/BPS participated in five focus groups moderated by a psychologist. Focus groups were conducted until thematic saturation was reached. Group discussions were transcribed and independently coded by two reviewers. Emergent themes and concepts were identified using grounded theory methodology. Data on symptoms and beliefs regarding medications were collected using validated questionnaires: Interstitial Cystitis Symptom and Problem Index (ICSI and ICPI) and Beliefs in Medications Questionnaire-Specific (BMQ-S). RESULTS: The median age of participants was 42 years, and all had some college education. Median score (range) for the ICSI was 12 (4, 20) and for the ICPI was 10 (3, 16), indicating moderate symptom burden. Most patients had tried only first- or second-line treatments. The median BMQ-S score was 2, indicating a neutral attitude toward medication. Several themes were identified. Patients expressed interest in self-management of symptoms using a structured care plan that incorporates guided self-care practices and care that can be delivered virtually.

There is currently a great need for effective and safe therapies directed at the disease, but no drugs are presently registered for use in COVID-19. Several directed therapies have been proposed, and most are still in clinical trials. Currently available published, peer-reviewed results mostly involve small sample sizes with study limitations restricting the interpretation of the findings. Many trials currently published also do not have a control group, limiting the interpretation of the effect of the intervention. Investigational directed therapies as well as investigational supportive therapies against COVID-19 are reviewed here. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine show promise as directed therapies, but current trial results are conflicting. Lopinavir/ritonavir also shows potential, but was started late in the disease course in most trials. No randomised controlled evidence is currently available for remdesivir and favipiravir. Corticosteroid use is not recommended for directed therapy against COVID-19, and the role of tocilizumab is currently unclear, based on limited evidence. Early initiation of investigational directed therapies may provide benefit in selected patients. The results from larger randomised controlled trials will clarify the place of these therapies in COVID-19 treatment.","van Rensburg, V; Pillay-Fuentes Lorente, V; Decloedt, E",African Journal of Thoracic &amp; Critical Care Medicine,382,28

However, the greater length and higher error rate of the reads generated on long-read platforms make the tools used for assembling short reads unsuitable for use in data assembly and motivate the development of new approaches. We present LoReTTA (Long Read Template-Targeted Assembler), a tool designed for performing de novo assembly of long reads generated from viral genomes on the PacBio platform. LoReTTA exploits a reference genome to guide the assembly process, an approach that has been successful with short reads. The tool was designed to deal with reads originating from viral genomes, which feature high genetic variability, possible multiple isoforms, and the dominant presence of additional organisms in clinical or environmental samples. LoReTTA was tested on a range of simulated and experimental datasets and outperformed established long-read assemblers in terms of assembly contiguity and accuracy. The software runs under the Linux operating system, is designed for easy adaptation to alternative systems, and features an automatic installation pipeline that takes care of the required dependencies. A command-line version and a user-friendly graphical interface version are available under a GPLv3 license at https://bioinformatics.cvr.ac.uk/software/ with the manual and a test dataset.","Al Qaffas, Ahmed; Nichols, Jenna; Davison, Andrew J; Ourahmane, Amine; Hertel, Laura; McVoy, Michael A; Camiolo, Salvatore",Virus Evol,382,1

From the outbreak of COVID-19, many efforts are being made to find a way to fight this pandemic. More than 300 clinical trials are ongoing to investigate the potential therapeutic option for preventing/treating COVID-19. Considering the critical role of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) in pathogenesis being primarily involved in polyprotein processing and virus maturation, it makes SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) as an attractive and promising antiviral target. Thus, in our study, we focused on SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)), used machine learning algorithms and virtually screened small derivatives of anthraquinolone and quinolizine from PubChem that may act as potential inhibitor. Prioritisation of cavity atoms obtained through pharmacophore mapping and other physicochemical descriptors of the derivatives helped mapped important chemical features for ligand binding interaction and also for synergistic studies with molecular docking. Subsequently, these studies outcome were supported through simulation trajectories that further proved anthraquinolone and quinolizine derivatives as potential small molecules to be tested experimentally in treating COVID-19 patients.","Samarth, Nikhil; Kabra, Ritika; Singh, Shailza",Sci Rep,382,17

A key role in the pathophysiology of stroke plays the disruption of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) within the neurovascular unit. While estrogen induces vascular protective actions, its influence on stroke remains unclear. Moreover, experiments assessing its impact on endothelial cells to induce barrier integrity are non-conclusive. Since pericytes play an active role in regulating BBB integrity and function, we hypothesize that estradiol may influence BBB by regulating their activity. In this study using human brain vascular pericytes (HBVPs) we investigated the impact of estradiol on key pericyte functions known to influence BBB integrity. HBVPs expressed estrogen receptors (ER-α, ER-β and GPER) and treatment with estradiol (10 nM) inhibited basal cell migration but not proliferation. Since pericyte migration is a hallmark for BBB disruption following injury, infection and inflammation, we investigated the effects of estradiol on TNFα-induced PC migration. Importantly, estradiol prevented TNFα-induced pericyte migration and this effect was mimicked by PPT (ER-α agonist) and DPN (ER-β agonist), but not by G1 (GPR30 agonist). The modulatory effects of estradiol were abrogated by MPP and PHTPP, selective ER-α and ER-β antagonists, respectively, confirming the role of ER-α and ER-β in mediating the anti-migratory actions of estrogen. To delineate the intracellular mechanisms mediating the inhibitory actions of estradiol on PC migration, we investigated the role of AKT and MAPK activation. While estradiol consistently reduced the TNFα-induced MAPK and Akt phosphorylation, only the inhibition of MAPK, but not Akt, significantly abrogated the migratory actions of TNFα. In transendothelial electrical resistance measurements, estradiol induced barrier function (TEER) in human brain microvascular endothelial cells co-cultured with pericytes, but not in HBMECs cultured alone. Importantly, transcriptomics analysis of genes modulated by estradiol in pericytes showed downregulation of genes known to increase cell migration and upregulation of genes known to inhibit cell migration. Taken together, our findings provide the first evidence that estradiol modulates pericyte activity and thereby improves endothelial integrity.","Kurmann, Lisa; Okoniewski, Michal; Dubey, Raghvendra K.",Cells,382,1

Secured medical image transmission requires adequate techniques for protecting patient privacy. This study aims at encrypting Coronavirus (COVID-19) images of Computed Tomography (CT) chest scan into cipherimages for secure real-world data transmission of infected patients. Provably safe pseudo-random generators are used for the production of a ""key-stream"" to achieve high privacy of patient data. The Blum Blum Shub (BBS) generator is a powerful generator of pseudo-random bit-strings. In this article, a hashing version of BBS, namely Hash-BBS (HBBS) generator, is presented to exploit the benefits of a hash function to reinforce the integrity of extracted binary sequences for creating multiple key-streams. The NIST-test-suite has been used to analyze and verify the statistical properties of resulted key bit-strings of all tested operations. The obtained bit-strings showed good randomness properties; consequently, uniform distributed binary sequence was achieved over the key length. Based on the obtained key-streams, an encryption scheme of four COVID-19 CT-images is proposed and designed to attain a high grade of confidentiality and integrity in transmission of medical data. In addition, a comprehensive performance analysis was done using different evaluation metrics. The evaluation results of this study demonstrated that the proposed key-stream generator outperforms the other security methods of previous studies. Therefore, it can be successfully applied to satisfy security requirements of transmitting CT-images for COVID-19 patients.","Reyad, Omar; Karar, Mohamed Esmail",Arab J Sci Eng,382,20

GL is also known to exhibit various biological activities, including anti-viral effects, but the anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) effect of GL remains to be clarified. In this study, we demonstrated that GL treatment of HCV-infected Huh7 cells caused a reduction of infectious HCV production using cell culture-produced HCV (HCVcc). To determine the target step in the HCV lifecycle of GL, we used HCV pseudoparticles (HCVpp), replicon, and HCVcc systems. Significant suppressions of viral entry and replication steps were not observed. Interestingly, extracellular infectivity was decreased, and intracellular infectivity was increased. By immunofluorescence and electron microscopic analysis of GL treated cells, HCV core antigens and electron-dense particles had accumulated on endoplasmic reticulum attached to lipid droplet (LD), respectively, which is thought to act as platforms for HCV assembly. Furthermore, the amount of HCV core antigen in LD fraction increased. Taken together, these results suggest that GL inhibits release of infectious HCV particles. GL is known to have an inhibitory effect on phospholipase A2 (PLA2). We found that group 1B PLA2 (PLA2G1B) inhibitor also decreased HCV release, suggesting that suppression of virus release by GL treatment may be due to its inhibitory effect on PLA2G1B.

To provide sufficient information for all involved decision-makers (clinicians, public health authorities, drug regulatory agencies) a multiplicity of endpoints must be considered. It is a challenge to generate detailed high quality evidence from data while ensuring fast availability and evaluation of the results. Methods: We reviewed all interventional COVID-19 trials on Remdesivir, Lopinavir/ritonavir and Hydroxychloroquine registered in the National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and summarized the endpoints used to assess treatment effects. We propose a multistate model that harmonizes heterogeneous endpoints and differing lengths of follow-up within and between trials. Results: There are currently, March 27, 2020, 23 registered interventional trials investigating the potential benefits of Remdesivir, Lopinavir/ritonavir and Hydroxychloroquine. The endpoints are highly heterogeneous. Follow-up for the primary endpoints ranges from four to 168 days. A detailed precisely defined endpoint has been proposed by the global network REMAP-CAP, which is specialized on community-acquired pneumonia. Their seven-category endpoint accounts for major clinical events informative for all decision-makers. Moreover, the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative is currently working on a core outcome set. We propose a multistate model that accommodates analysis of these recommended endpoints. The model allows for a detailed investigation of treatment effects for various endpoints over the course of time thereby harmonizing differing endpoints and lengths of follow-up. Conclusion: Multistate model analysis is a powerful tool to study clinically heterogeneous endpoints (mortality, discharge) as well as endpoints influencing hospital capacities (duration of hospitalization and ventilation) simultaneously over time. Our proposed model extracts all information available in the data and is - by harmonizing endpoints within and between trials - a step towards faster decision making. All ongoing clinical trials, especially those with severe cases, should accommodate primary analysis with a stacked probability plot of the major events mechanical ventilation, discharge alive and death.","von Cube, Maja; Grodd, Marlon; Wolkewitz, Martin; Hazard, Derek; Lambert, Jerome",,382,16

METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted from April 8-11, 2020, among a representative sample of 600 Canadian adults from two different contexts (n=300 in Quebec, the French part of Canada, and n=300 elsewhere in Canada). Two psychological outcomes were assessed: probable post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and probable generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The roles of various stressors (i.e., threat perceived for oneself or family/friends, quarantine or isolation, financial losses, victims of stigma), assets (i.e., trust in authorities, information received, and compliance with directives) and sources of information used on these two outcomes were also examined. Chi-square tests were performed to examine differences in the distribution of probable PTSD and GAD according to these stressors and assets. RESULTS: Probable PTSD and GAD were observed in 25.5% and 25.4% of the respondents, respectively. These proportions were significantly lower in Quebec than elsewhere in Canada. Perceiving a high level of threat and being a victim of stigma were positively associated with probable PTSD and GAD (but not quarantine/isolation and financial losses). A high level of trust in authorities was the only asset associated with a lower risk of PTSD or GAD. Interestingly, this asset was more frequently reported in Quebec than elsewhere in Canada. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic represents a unique opportunity to evaluate the psychosocial impacts on various sociocultural groups and contexts, providing important lessons that could help respond to future disasters.","Généreux, Mélissa; Roy, Mathieu; David, Marc D; Carignan, Marie-Ève; Blouin-Genest, Gabriel; Qadar, S M Zeeshan; Champagne-Poirier, Olivier",Glob Health Promot,382,20

WHO, UNICEF and Gavi warn that at least 80 million children under the age of 1 are at risk of contracting diseases such as diphtheria, measles and polio due to the interruption of routine immunization and the temporary suspension of 93 campaigns of large-scale vaccination. In Spain, a new healthcare scenario, which prioritizes telematics over in person, fear of contagion by going to health centers, and recommendations for physical distance and restricted mobility, reduce attendance at primary care centers. Despite recommendations established by the health authorities, vaccination coverage has decreased in all Autonomous Communities between 5% and 60%, depending on the age and type of vaccine. School vaccinations have been suspended and only vaccination of pregnant women against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis has been maintained. The decrease has been more evident for non gratuity vaccines: the first dose of meningococcal vaccine B has decreased by 68.4%in the Valencian Community, and Andalusia has observed a 39% decrease in the total doses of this vaccine and of 18% for that of rotavirus. The recovering of vaccinations should be planned, organized and carried out in the shortest possible time.

A recent IJHPR article by Greenberg et al. evaluated changes in emergency department care following a directive of the Israeli Ministry of Health to limit occupancy in internal medicine wards. Over a six-year observation period, they found that one-month mortality and one-week readmissions after ED visits remained unchanged, while increases in average ED visit length, as well as increased delay time from ED admission to ward were observed. These findings help to assess the impact of the occupancy limit directive and may support future health policy decisions. However, the study by Greenberg et al. was limited by the unavailability of diagnostic data, and this illustrates a significant issue that transcends this particular study. In many countries, policy-relevant administrative data are not sufficiently available on a timely basis. Data availability is the prerequisite for monitoring developments in patterns of care following health policy changes. Besides conducting retrospective studies, timely availability of data makes it possible to establish monitoring systems which may help decision makers assess the impact of policy changes, identify undesired developments early, and recognize changes in need or demand of health services within the population.","Nimptsch, Ulrike",Isr J Health Policy Res,382,5

Prior research has demonstrated VDR regulation of bacteria; however, little is known regarding VDR and viruses. We hypothesize that VDR deficiency impacts on the intestinal virome and viral-bacterial interactions. We specifically deleted VDR from intestinal epithelial cells (VDR(ΔIEC)), Paneth cells (VDR(ΔPC)), and myeloid cells (VDR(ΔLyz)) in mice. Feces were collected for shotgun metagenomic sequencing and metabolite profiling. To test the functional changes, we evaluated pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and analyzed microbial metabolites. Vibrio phages, Lactobacillus phages, and Escherichia coli typing phages were significantly enriched in all three conditional VDR-knockout mice. In the VDR(ΔLyz) mice, the levels of eight more virus species (2 enriched, 6 depleted) were significantly changed. Altered virus species were primarily observed in female VDR(ΔLyz) (2 enriched, 3 depleted) versus male VDR(ΔLyz) (1 enriched, 1 depleted). Altered alpha and beta diversity (family to species) were found in VDR(ΔLyz). In VDR(ΔIEC) mice, bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 was significantly enriched. A significant correlation between viral and bacterial alterations was found in conditional VDR knockout mice. There was a positive correlation between Vibrio phage JSF5 and Cutibacterium acnes in VDR(ΔPC) and VDR(ΔLyz) mice. Also, there were more altered viral species in female conditional VDR knockout mice. Notably, there were significant changes in PRRs: upregulated TLR3, TLR7, and NOD2 in VDR(ΔLyz) mice and increased CLEC4L expression in VDR(ΔIEC) and VDR(ΔPC) mice. Furthermore, we identified metabolites related to virus infection: decreased glucose in VDR(ΔIEC) mice, increased ribulose/xylulose and xylose in VDR(ΔLyz) mice, and increased long-chain fatty acids in VDR(ΔIEC) and VDR(ΔLyz) female mice. Tissue-specific deletion of VDR changes the virome and functionally changes viral receptors, which leads to dysbiosis, metabolic dysfunction, and infection risk. This study helps to elucidate VDR regulating the virome in a tissue-specific and sex-specific manner.","Zhang, Jilei; Zhang, Yongguo; Xia, Yinglin; Sun, Jun",Gut microbes,382,1

The genetic diversity of viruses is commensurately enormous and might substantially exceed the diversity of cellular organisms. Unlike cellular organisms with their uniform replication-expression scheme, viruses possess either RNA or DNA genomes and exploit all conceivable replication-expression strategies. Although viruses extensively exchange genes with their hosts, there exists a set of viral hallmark genes that are shared by extremely diverse groups of viruses to the exclusion of cellular life forms. Coevolution of viruses and host defense systems is a key aspect in the evolution of both viruses and cells, and viral genes are often recruited for cellular functions. Together with the fundamental inevitability of the emergence of genomic parasites in any evolving replicator system, these multiple lines of evidence reveal the central role of viruses in the entire evolution of life.","Koonin, Eugene V.; Dolja, Valerian V.",Current Opinion in Virology,382,30

Here, we investigated the molecular, phylogenomic, and evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in western India, the most affected region of the country. A total of 90 genomes were sequenced. Four nucleotide variants, namely C241T, C3037T, C14408T (Pro4715Leu), and A23403G (Asp614Gly), located at 5UTR, Orf1a, Orf1b, and Spike protein regions of the genome, respectively, were predominant and ubiquitous (90%). Phylogenetic analysis of the genomes revealed four distinct clusters, formed owing to different variants. The major cluster (cluster 4) is distinguished by mutations C313T, C5700A, G28881A are unique patterns and observed in 45% of samples. We thus report a newly emerging pattern of linked mutations. The predominance of these linked mutations suggests that they are likely a part of the viral fitness landscape. A novel and distinct pattern of mutations in the viral strains of each of the districts was observed. The Satara district viral strains showed mutations primarily at the 3' end of the genome, while Nashik district viral strains displayed mutations at the 5' end of the genome. Characterization of Pune strains showed that a novel variant has overtaken the other strains. Examination of the frequency of three mutations i.e., C313T, C5700A, G28881A in symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients indicated an increased occurrence in symptomatic cases, which is more prominent in females. The age-wise specific pattern of mutation is observed. Mutations C18877T, G20326A, G24794T, G25563T, G26152T, and C26735T are found in more than 30% study samples in the age group of 10-25. Intriguingly, these mutations are not detected in the higher age range 61-80. These findings portray the prevalence of unique linked mutations in SARS-CoV-2 in western India and their prevalence in symptomatic patients. ImportanceElucidation of the SARS-CoV-2 mutational landscape within a specific geographical location, and its relationship with age and symptoms, is essential to understand its local transmission dynamics and control.

Las técnicas moleculares tienen como principales ventajas una excelente sensibilidad, especificidad, capacidad de adaptación a virus emergentes, capacidad para detectar múltiples dianas en un mismo ensayo y posibilidad de automatización. Adicionalmente, estas técnicas han permitido profundizar en el papel de los virus en la infección respiratoria aguda a la vez que han descrito la existencia de nuevos virus no conocidos previamente. Los métodos moleculares y no moleculares de diagnóstico rápido para 1 o más virus respiratorios han permitido la toma de decisiones de forma inmediata en el manejo del paciente mejorando su pronóstico y evitando la transmisión nosocomial. Sin embargo, también hay inconvenientes, la mayor sensibilidad de las técnicas moleculares ha supuesto un incremento significativo de la tasa de codetecciones múltiples de virus respiratorios, cuya implicación clínica resulta difícil de interpretar. Finalmente queda por demostrar todavía si la utilización de las nuevas técnicas, de elevado coste, en el diagnóstico microbiológico de rutina de las infecciones respiratorias agudas de etiología viral, en el paciente hospitalizado, es coste-efectiva. Abstract Conventional techniques for the diagnosis of respiratory viruses are still being used, although molecular methods are now considered as a gold standard in this field. Molecular techniques have a great number of advantages such as an excellent sensitivity, specificity, adaptability to emerging viruses, capability for multiplex and for automation. With all the available repertoire of techniques for microbiological diagnosis, the knowledge relative to respiratory viruses is growing up not only for new aetiological agents but also for its epidemiology. The advances in molecular and non-molecular fast diagnostic methods for one or more respiratory viruses allow quick decisions in the management of the patient. However, there are also disadvantages. The great sensitivity of molecular techniques has meant a significant increase in the rate of multiple detections of respiratory viruses, whose clinical involvement is difficult to interpret. Finally, it remains to show whether the use of new techniques, of high cost, in the microbiological routine diagnosis of acute respiratory viral infections in the hospitalized patient, is cost effective.","Pagarolas, Andrés Antón; Suñé, Tomàs Pumarola",Enfermedades Infecciosas y Microbiología Clínica,382,20

In this paper, we compare through simulations the performance of six screening plans based on poorly sensitive individual tests, in detecting infection outbreaks at the level of single classes in a typical European school context. The performance evaluation is done by simulating different epidemic dynamics within the class during the four weeks following the day of the initial infection. The plans have different costs in terms of number of individual tests required for the screening and are based on recurrent evaluations on all students or subgroups of students in rotation. Especially in scenarios where the rate of contagion is high, at an equal cost, testing half of the class in rotation every week appears to be better in terms of sensitivity than testing all students every two weeks. Similarly, testing one-fourth of the students every week is comparable with testing all students every two weeks, despite the first one is a much cheaper strategy. In conclusion, we show that in the presence of natural clusters in the population, testing subgroups of individuals belonging to the same cluster in rotation may have a better performance than testing all the individuals less frequently. The proposed simulations approach can be extended to evaluate more complex screening plans than those presented in the paper.","Baccini, Michela; Cereda, Giulia",PLoS One,382,23

Here, we report preliminary results on the efficacy and safety of Gam-COVID-Vac from the interim analysis of this phase 3 trial. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial at 25 hospitals and polyclinics in Moscow, Russia. We included participants aged at least 18 years, with negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR and IgG and IgM tests, no infectious diseases in the 14 days before enrolment, and no other vaccinations in the 30 days before enrolment. Participants were randomly assigned (3:1) to receive vaccine or placebo, with stratification by age group. Investigators, participants, and all study staff were masked to group assignment. The vaccine was administered (0·5 mL/dose) intramuscularly in a prime-boost regimen: a 21-day interval between the first dose (rAd26) and the second dose (rAd5), both vectors carrying the gene for the full-length SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein S. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 from day 21 after receiving the first dose. All analyses excluded participants with protocol violations: the primary outcome was assessed in participants who had received two doses of vaccine or placebo, serious adverse events were assessed in all participants who had received at least one dose at the time of database lock, and rare adverse events were assessed in all participants who had received two doses and for whom all available data were verified in the case report form at the time of database lock. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04530396). FINDINGS: Between Sept 7 and Nov 24, 2020, 21 977 adults were randomly assigned to the vaccine group (n=16 501) or the placebo group (n=5476). 19 866 received two doses of vaccine or placebo and were included in the primary outcome analysis. From 21 days after the first dose of vaccine (the day of dose 2), 16 (0·1%) of 14 964 participants in the vaccine group and 62 (1·3%) of 4902 in the placebo group were confirmed to have COVID-19; vaccine efficacy was 91·6% (95% CI 85·6–95·2). Most reported adverse events were grade 1 (7485 [94·0%] of 7966 total events). 45 (0·3%) of 16 427 participants in the vaccine group and 23 (0·4%) of 5435 participants in the placebo group had serious adverse events; none were considered associated with vaccination, with confirmation from the independent data monitoring committee. Four deaths were reported during the study (three [<0·1%] of 16 427 participants in the vaccine group and one [<0·1%] of 5435 participants in the placebo group), none of which were considered related to the vaccine.

Our objective was to identify how pharmacists’ roles were portrayed in images on Twitter for World Pharmacists Day (WPD) 2020. METHODS: A qualitative content analysis was undertaken to evaluate the images of pharmacists on WPD. Tweets were included that had a photo or image, used 1 of 5 WPD hashtags and were posted between September 24 and 26, 2020. Thematic analysis was performed independently by 2 investigators. Tweets were categorized into 5 groups: 1) drug distribution roles, 2) patient care roles, 3) no described roles, 4) not professional/unprofessional roles and 5) not relevant. Subgroup analysis was performed for the users who posted the tweets. RESULTS: Of the 970 tweets analyzed, only 11% of the overall tweets portrayed the patient care roles of pharmacists, whereas 51% portrayed drug distribution roles and 29% did not describe any particular roles of pharmacists. These proportions were similar between subgroups of tweeters. DISCUSSION: WPD is intended to promote and advocate for the pharmacy profession. The results of our study show poor messaging of pharmacists’ roles and reflect a missed opportunity to showcase the full scope of pharmacy practice. CONCLUSION: Based on the images tweeted on WPD 2020, the diversity of pharmacists’ practice as skilled health care practitioners was lost in a sea of tweets portraying pharmacists’ roles in drug distribution. We hope that pharmacists and pharmacy organizations will awaken to this self-induced problem for WPD 2021.

Viral diseases are highly infectious and capable of causing pandemics as evidenced by outbreaks of diseases like Ebola, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, West Nile, SARS-Corona, Nipah, Hendra, Avian influenza and Swine influenza. EXPALANTION: Many viruses affecting equines are also important human pathogens. Diseases like Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), Western equine encephalitis (WEE), and Venezuelan-equine encephalitis (VEE) are highly infectious and can be disseminated as aerosols. A large number of horses and human cases of VEE with fatal encephalitis have continuously occurred in Venezuela and Colombia. Vesicular stomatitis (VS) is prevalent in horses in North America and has zoonotic potential causing encephalitis in children. Hendra virus (HeV) causes respiratory and neurological disease and death in man and horses. Since its first outbreak in 1994, 53 disease incidents have been reported in Australia. West Nile fever has spread to many newer territories across continents during recent years. It has been described in Africa, Europe, South Asia, Oceania and North America. Japanese encephalitis has expanded horizons from Asia to western Pacific region including the eastern Indonesian archipelago, Papua New Guinea and Australia. Rabies is rare in horses but still a public health concern being a fatal disease. Equine influenza is historically not known to affect humans but many scientists have mixed opinions. Equine viral diseases of zoonotic importance and their impact on animal and human health have been elaborated in this article. CONCLUSION: Equine viral diseases though restricted to certain geographical areas have huge impact on equine and human health. Diseases like West Nile fever, Hendra, VS, VEE, EEE, JE, Rabies have the potential for spread and ability to cause disease in human. Equine influenza is historically not known to affect humans but some experimental and observational evidence show that H3N8 influenza virus has infected man. Despite our pursuit of understanding the complexity of the vector-host-pathogen mediating disease transmission, it is not possible to make generalized predictions concerning the degree of impact of disease emergence. A targeted, multidisciplinary effort is required to understand the risk factors for zoonosis and apply the interventions necessary to control it.","Kumar, Balvinder; Manuja, Anju; Gulati, BR; Virmani, Nitin; Tripathi, B.N.",Open Virol J,382,6

Although best known for causing symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection in mild cases and fulminant pneumonia in severe disease, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has also been associated with gastrointestinal, neurologic, cardiac, and hematologic presentations. Despite concerns over poor specificity and undue radiation exposure, chest imaging nonetheless remains central to the initial diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19 progression, as well as to the evaluation of complications. Classic features on chest CT include ground-glass and reticular opacities with or without superimposed consolidations, frequently presenting in a bilateral, peripheral, and posterior distribution. More recently, studies conducted with MRI have shown excellent concordance with chest CT in visualizing typical features of COVID-19 pneumonia. For patients in whom exposure to ionizing radiation should be avoided, particularly pregnant women and children, pulmonary MRI may represent a suitable alternative to chest CT. Although PET imaging is not typically considered among first-line investigative modalities for the diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections, numerous reports have noted incidental localization of radiotracer in parenchymal regions of COVID-19-associated pulmonary lesions. These findings are consistent with data from Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV cohorts suggesting an ability for (18)F-FDG PET to detect subclinical infection and lymphadenitis in subjects without overt clinical signs of infection. Though highly sensitive, use of PET/CT for primary detection of COVID-19 is constrained by poor specificity, as well as considerations of cost, radiation burden, and prolonged exposure times for imaging staff. Even still, decontamination of scanner bays is a time-consuming process, and proper ventilation of scanner suites may additionally require up to an hour of downtime to allow for sufficient air exchange. Yet, in patients who require nuclear medicine investigations for other clinical indications, PET imaging may yield the earliest detection of nascent infection in otherwise asymptomatic individuals. Especially for patients with concomitant malignancies and other states of immunocompromise, prompt recognition of infection and early initiation of supportive care is crucial to maximizing outcomes and improving survivability.","Fields, Brandon K.K.; Demirjian, Natalie L.; Dadgar, Habibollah; Gholamrezanezhad, Ali",Semin Nucl Med,382,20

To a much lesser extent, arterial thrombo-embolic events have also been reported in this setting. CASE SUMMARY: Here, we describe four different cases of COVID-19 infection with ischaemic arterial events, such as a myocardial infarction with high thrombus load, ischaemic stroke on spontaneous thrombosis of the aortic valve, floating thrombus with mesenteric, splenic and renal infarction, and acute limb ischaemia. DISCUSSION: Cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes are comorbidities most frequently found in patients with a severe COVID-19 infection and are associated with a higher death rate. Our goal is to provide an overview of the clinical spectrum of ischaemic arterial events that may either reveal or complicate COVID-19. Several suspected pathophysiological mechanisms could explain the association between cardiovascular events and COVID-19 (role of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, endothelial dysfunction, activation of coagulation cascade leading to a hypercoagulability state, virus-induced secondary antiphospholipid syndrome). We need additional studies of larger size, to estimate the incidence of these arterial events and to assess the efficacy of anticoagulation therapy.","Guillet, Henri; Gallet, Romain; Pham, Vincent; D’Humières, Thomas; Huguet, Raphaelle; Lim, Pascal; Michel, Marc; Khellaf, Mehdi",Eur Heart J Case Rep,382,16

First, using nominal-group technique, we identified the DL learning theories to be employed in blueprinting the DL-framework. Effectiveness of the designed DL-framework in anatomy teaching was demonstrated using the exemplar of the Head and Neck (H&N) course during COVID-19 lockdown, in the pre-clerkship curriculum at our medical school. The dissemination of the DL-framework in the anatomy course was informed by the Analyse, Design, Develop, Implement, and Evaluate (ADDIE) model. The efficiency of the DL-framework was evaluated using the first two levels of Kirkpatrick's model. Versatility of the DL-framework was demonstrated by aligning its precepts with individual domains of key learning outcomes framework. The framework's blueprint was designed amalgamating principles of: Garrison's community inquiry, Siemens' connectivism and Harasim's online-collaborative-learning; and improved using Anderson's DL-model. Following the implementation of the DL-framework in the H&N course informed by ADDIE, the framework's efficiency was evaluated. In total, 70% students responded to the survey assessing perception toward DL (Kirkpatrick's Level: 1). Descriptive analysis of the survey results showed that the DL-framework was positively received by students and attested that students had an enriched learning experience, which promoted collaborative-learning and student-autonomy. For, Kirkpatrick's Level: 2 i.e., cognitive development, we compared the summative assessment performance in the H&N course across three cohort of students. The results show that the scores of the cohort, which experienced the course entirely through DL modality was statistically higher (P < 0.01) than both the other cohorts, indicating that shift to DL did not have an adverse effect on students' learning. Using Bourdieu's Theory of Practice, we showed that the DL-framework is an efficient pedagogical approach, pertinent for medical schools to adopt; and is versatile as it attests to the key domains of students' learning outcomes in the different learning outcomes framework. To our knowledge this is the first-study of its kind where a rationale and theory-guided approach has been availed not only to blueprint a DL framework, but also to implement it in the MBBS curriculum.","Naidoo, Nerissa; Azar, Aida J.; Khamis, Amar Hassan; Gholami, Mandana; Lindsbro, Marjam; Alsheikh-Ali, Alawi; Banerjee, Yajnavalka",Front Public Health,382,20

Available nitric oxide (NO) is one of the major contributors to such complex adaptations at depth and oxidative stress is one of the major collateral effects of diving. Due to technical difficulties, these biomarkers have not so far been studied in vivo while at depth. The aim of this study is to investigate nitrate and nitrite (NOx) concentration, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and lipid peroxidation (TBARS) before, during, and after repetitive breath-hold dives in healthy volunteers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood plasma, obtained from 14 expert breath-hold divers, was tested for differences in NOx, TAC, and TBARS between pre-dive, bottom, surface, 30 and 60 min post-dive samples. RESULTS: We observed a statistically significant increase of NOx plasma concentration in the “bottom blood draw” as compared to the pre-dive condition while we did not find any difference in the following samples We found a statistically significant decrease in TAC at the bottom but the value returned to normality immediately after reaching the surface. We did not find any statistically significant difference in TBARS. DISCUSSION: The increased plasma NOx values found at the bottom were not observed at surface and post dive sampling (T0, T30, T60), showing a very rapid return to the pre-dive values. Also TAC values returned to pre- diving levels immediately after the end of hyperbaric exposure, probably as a consequence of the activation of endogenous antioxidant defenses. TBARS did not show any difference during the protocol.","Cialoni, Danilo; Brizzolari, Andrea; Samaja, Michele; Bosco, Gerardo; Paganini, Matteo; Pieri, Massimo; Lancellotti, Valentina; Marroni, Alessandro",Front Physiol,382,16

Recent studies have shown that wastewater surveillance can be a low-cost tool for management of COVID-19 pandemic and tracking COVID-19 outbreaks in communities but most studies have been focusing on sampling from wastewater treatment plants. Institutional level of wastewater surveillance may serve well for early warning purposes since cases can be tracked and immediate action can be executed in the event of positive signal. In this study, a novel Moore swab method was developed and used for wastewater surveillance of COVID-19 at institutional level. Among the 219 swab samples tested, 28 (12.8%) swabs collected from the three campuses and two buildings were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Further individual clinical diagnosis validated the wastewater results and indicated that this method was sensitive enough to detect 1-2 cases in a building. In addition, comparison between grab and Moore swab methods from the hospital sewage line indicated that Moore swab method was more sensitive than the grab sampling method. These results suggest that the Moore swab is a sensitive, practical, and easy to use early warning tool for COVID-19 surveillance especially in low-resource settings and at an early stage of infection in communities.","Liu, Pengbo; Ibaraki, Makoto; VanTassell, Jamie; Geith, Kelly; Cavallo, Matthew; Kann, Rebecca; Moe, Christine",,382,20

METHODS: Thirty-five older adults with hypertension were included in this exploratory study. Accelerometer-based PA and SB measures were assessed before and during a period of social distancing policy imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Housing type, housing surface area and household size were tested as predictors of changes in PA and SB. A generalized linear mixed model was used for the analysis. RESULTS: Housing type was associated with changes in PA and SB. Individuals residing in an apartment showed a greater decrease in light PA on weekdays (β= –65 min/day, p=0.035) and a trend for an increase in SB (β= 55 min/day, p=0.056) compared to those residing in a detached house.

We assessed the effect of community-wide mask usage to control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). Methods Patients presenting with respiratory symptoms at outpatient clinics or hospital wards were screened for COVID-19 per protocol. Epidemiological analysis was performed for confirmed cases, especially persons acquiring COVID-19 during mask-off and mask-on settings. The incidence of COVID-19 per-million-population in HKSAR with community-wide masking was compared to that of non-mask-wearing countries which are comparable with HKSAR in terms of population density, healthcare system, BCG vaccination and social distancing measures but not community-wide masking. Compliance of face mask usage in the HKSAR community was monitored. Findings Within first 100 days (31 December 2019 to 8 April 2020), 961 COVID-19 patients were diagnosed in HKSAR. The COVID-19 incidence in HKSAR (129.0 per-million-population) was significantly lower (p<0.001) than that of Spain (2983.2), Italy (2250.8), Germany (1241.5), France (1151.6), U.S. (1102.8), U.K. (831.5), Singapore (259.8), and South Korea (200.5). The compliance of face mask usage by HKSAR general public was 96.6% (range: 95.7% to 97.2%). We observed 11 COVID-19 clusters in recreational ‘mask-off’ settings compared to only 3 in workplace ‘mask-on’ settings (p = 0.036 by Chi square test of goodness-of-fit).

One of the factors that guide students through learning environments is their emotions. The few existing scales that measure the emotions of adolescents in learning environments have been developed with consideration of face-to-face learning environments and their items do not adequately express the state of online environments. For this reason, this study aimed to develop a scale which reveals the emotions of adolescents that may affect their academic success with regard to this transition of learning environments as they attend online lessons. A total of 3,655 middle and high school students living in Istanbul, Turkey, participated in the study. The scoring system was designed with regard to the frequency with which each student reading an item experiences the relevant emotion for the item in the online learning environment. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses conducted show the scale to possess a four-dimensional structure. These dimensions are enjoyment-pride, boredom-hopelessness, loneliness and anxiety. For all dimensions of the scale, Cronbach alpha values range between .93 and .83. ‘Positive and Negative Affects Schedule-Children’ was used to confirm the scale’s criterion-related validity, and correlations between dimensions were examined.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationship between self-esteem versus burnout; and effort-reward ratio versus favorability to the work environment, among Chinese nurses. METHODS: We employed four validated questionnaires in the assessment burnout, self-esteem, effort-reward ratio, and favorability of nursing workplace; Maslach-Burnout Inventory (MBI), Rosenberg’s self-esteem (RS), Effort-Reward imbalance (ERI) and Work-Environment Scale questionnaires (WES). Linear and ordinal regression models were utilized to assess the relationships between the variables. Analyses were conducted by using SPSS at a 95% level of significance. RESULTS: We assessed 487 (Mean age: 38.8±7.1 years) nurses from three hospitals. Higher self-esteem was associated with a lower level of emotional exhaustion (Unstandardized coefficient: -0.579, p-Value<0.001); and a lower level of depersonalization (Unstandardized coefficient: -0.212, p-Value = 0.001). The relationship between self-esteem and personal achievement did not reach statistical significance. A higher effort-reward ratio was associated with less likelihood that nurses would consider their work environment favorable (Logit estimate of -0.832, p-Value = 0.014). CONCLUSION: Lower self-esteem is associated with increased burnout. A higher effort-reward ratio is associated with an enhanced perception work environment as unfavorable. We recommend psychosocial intervention programs and amendments in nursing policies to improve effort-reward imbalance among Chinese nurses.","Kabakleh, Yasira; Zhang, Jing-ping; Lv, Mengmeng; Li, Juan; Yang, Silan; Swai, Joel; Li, Hui-Yuan",PLoS One,382,24

Many SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) were developed with efficient therapeutic potential. NAbs-based therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 are being expedited to preclinical and clinical studies with two antibody drugs, LY3819253 (LY-CoV555) and REGN-COV2 (REGN10933 and REGN10987), approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization for treating COVID-19. In this review, we provide a systemic overview of SARS-CoV-2 specific or cross-reactive NAbs and discuss their structures, functions and neutralization mechanisms. We provide insight into how these NAbs specific recognize the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 or cross-react to other CoVs. We also summarize the challenges of NAbs therapeutics such as antibody-dependent enhancement and viral escape mutations. Such evidence is urgently needed to the development of antibody therapeutic interventions that are likely required to reduce the global burden of COVID-19.","Huang, Yang; Sun, Hui; Yu, Hai; Li, Shaowei; Zheng, Qingbing; Xia, Ningshao",Antib Ther,382,5

Fifty-nine episodes of URI occurred in 56 residents during the study period. Serologic testing or virus isolation proved or suggested an etiologic agent on 22 occasions. URI was more common in late Fall and Winter and was caused by various agents, including influenza, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza viruses. A minor outbreak of influenza B in February 1986 contrasted with previous cases of URI in that the patients had a higher mean temperature and abnormal breath sounds, and they were clinically sicker. This suggests that clinical and epidemiologic surveillance during the influenza season may allow the early recognition of influenza in elderly nursing home residents. Over a 4-year period 147 serum antibody responses after influenza infection or influenza vaccination were compiled. Antibody responses to individual influenza vaccine components were measured 75 to 90 days after vaccination. The geometric mean titer (GMT) and the percentage of samples with antibody levels ⩾ 1:40 were determined for each of the three antigenic subtypes on 3 consecutive years. The GMT to individual vaccine components was consistently greater than 1:40, except to influenza B/Singapore in 1984 and A/Chile and B/U.S.S.R. in 1985, when these subtypes were first included in the vaccine, suggesting the NHCU residents responded less vigorously to unfamiliar vaccine subtypes. In 1984 the GMT to A/Phillippines of unvaccinated NHCU residents without URI was surprisingly no different from the corresponding GMT of their vaccinated counterparts, raising the possibility that an influenza A/Phillippines outbreak in 1983 conferred herd immunity.","Arroyo, Julio C.; Jordan, Wanda; Milligan, Lloyd",American Journal of Infection Control,382,12

There are reports of SARS-CoV-2 transmission as a consequence of environmental contamination. The SARS-CoV-2 laden infective droplets can actively persist on the surface of different materials for several hours to days. Sunlight can affect the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in these aerosols and thereby have an impact on the decay rate of the virus. Solar radiation might play an important role in inactivating SARS-CoV-2 that persists in different surfaces and the environment. Among the different climatological factors, ultraviolet radiation was found to have an important role in determining the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Although ultraviolet radiation C (UVC), UVB, UVA, visible light, and infrared radiation possess germicidal properties, human CoVs including the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 are inherently sensitive to UVC. However, the successful decontamination using other wavebands requires higher dosages and longer administration times. Furthermore, studies have also identified association between COVID-19 fatalities and the latitude. The intensity of sunlight is highest near the equator, and therefore populations in these regions with more regular exposure to sunlight are less susceptible to vitamin D deficiency. This article has analyzed the potential impact of sunlight in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility, morbidity, and mortality. It is evident that there exists an interesting link between sunlight exposure, latitude, and vitamin D status with COVID-19 incidence, fatality and recovery rates that requires further investigation.","Sharun, Khan; Tiwari, Ruchi; Dhama, Kuldeep",Ann Med Surg (Lond),382,24

Vaccine hesitancy plays an important role in the decreasing rates of vaccination and is considered by the World Health Organization as a top ten global threat to public health. Online vaccine misinformation is present in news outlets, websites, and social media, and its rapid and extensive dissemination is aided by artificial intelligence (AI). In combating online misinformation, public health experts, the medical community, and lay vaccination advocates can correct false statements using language that appeal to those who are undecided about vaccination. As the gatekeepers to online information, they can implement and enforce policy that limits or bans vaccine misinformation on their platforms. AI tools might also be used to address misinformation, but more research is needed before implementing this approach more broadly in health policy. This commentary examines the role that different online platforms appear to be playing in the spread of misinformation about vaccines. We also discuss the implications of online misinformation on attitudes about COVID-19 vaccine uptake and provide suggestions for ways to combat online misinformation.","Garett, Renee; Young, Sean D",Transl Behav Med,382,6

The prevalence of anxiety among the public has increased dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there are few studies evaluating the effects of positive psychological responses and information-seeking behaviors on anxiety experienced among social media users during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the prevalence of anxiety and its associated factors among WeChat users in mainland China during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: From February 10 to February 24, 2020, a nationwide, web-based cross-sectional survey study was carried out using convenience sampling. Participants’ levels of anxiety, positive psychological responses, and information-seeking behaviors were assessed. The survey was distributed among WeChat users via the WeChat smartphone platform. Chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the factors associated with anxiety. RESULTS: This study found that the prevalence of anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item [GAD-7] scale score ≥7) among WeChat users in China was 17.96% (446/2483) during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results of multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that information-seeking behaviors such as cannot stop searching for information on COVID-19, being concerned about the COVID-19 pandemic, and spending more than 1 hour per day consuming information about the pandemic were found to be associated with increased levels of anxiety. Additionally, participants who chose social media and commercial media as the primary sources to obtain information about the COVID-19 pandemic were found more likely to report anxiety. Conversely, participants who were confident or rational about the COVID-19 pandemic were less likely to report anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that positive psychological responses and information-seeking behaviors were closely associated with anxiety among WeChat users during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. It might be paramount to enhance mental well-being by helping people respond to the COVID-19 pandemic more rationally and positively in order to decrease symptoms of anxiety.","Zou, Changqing; Zhang, Weiyu; Sznajder, Kristin; Yang, Fengzhi; Jia, Yajing; Ma, Ruqing; Cui, Can; Yang, Xiaoshi",J Med Internet Res,382,1
