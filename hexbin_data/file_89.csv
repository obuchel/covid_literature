143,143,143,The intrinsically disordered C‐terminal domain of the measles virus nucleoprotein interacts with the C‐terminal domain of the phosphoprotein via two distinct sites and remains predominantly unfolded,9.618338,7.9514275,2009-01-01,"Measles virus is a negative‐sense, single‐stranded RNA virus within theMononegavirales order,which includes several human pathogens, including rabies, Ebola, Nipah, and Hendra viruses. Themeasles virus nucleoprotein consists of a structured N‐terminal domain, and of an intrinsically disordered C‐terminal domain, N(TAIL) (aa 401–525), which undergoes induced folding in the presence of the C‐terminal domain (XD, aa 459–507) of the viral phosphoprotein. With in N(TAIL), an α‐helical molecular recognition element (α‐MoRE, aa 488–499) involved in binding to P and in induced folding was identified and then observed in the crystal structure of XD. Using small‐angle X‐ray scattering, we have derived a low‐resolution structural model of the complex between XD and N(TAIL), which shows that most of N(TAIL) remains disordered in the complex despite P‐induced folding within the α‐MoRE. The model consists of an extended shape accommodating the multiple conformations adopted by the disordered N‐terminal region of N(TAIL), and of a bulky globular region, corresponding to XD and to the C terminus of N(TAIL) (aa 486–525). Using surface plasmon resonance, circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy, and heteronuclear magnetic resonance, we show that N(TAIL) has an additional site (aa 517–525) involved in binding to XD but not in the unstructured‐to‐structured transition. This work provides evidence that intrinsically disordered domains can establish complex interactions with their partners, and can contact them through multiple sites that do not all necessarily gain regular secondary structure.","Bourhis, Jean‐Marie; Receveur‐Bréchot, Véronique; Oglesbee, Michael; Zhang, Xinsheng; Buccellato, Matthew; Darbon, Hervé; Canard, Bruno; Finet, Stéphanie; Longhi, Sonia",Protein Sci,89,28
588,588,588,Machupo Virus Glycoprotein Determinants for Human Transferrin Receptor 1 Binding and Cell Entry,9.986921,8.157416,2011-07-07,"Machupo virus (MACV) is a highly pathogenic New World arenavirus that causes hemorrhagic fever in humans. MACV, as well as other pathogenic New World arenaviruses, enter cells after their GP1 attachment glycoprotein binds to their cellular receptor, transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1). TfR1 residues essential for this interaction have been described, and a co-crystal of MACV GP1 bound to TfR1 suggests GP1 residues important for this association. We created MACV GP1 variants and tested their effect on TfR1 binding and virus entry to evaluate the functional significance of some of these and additional residues in human and simian cells. We found residues R111, D123, Y122, and F226 to be essential, D155, and P160 important, and D114, S116, D140, and K169 expendable for the GP1-TfR1 interaction and MACV entry. Several MACV GP1 residues that are critical for the interaction with TfR1 are conserved among other New World arenaviruses, indicating a common basis of receptor interaction. Our findings also open avenues for the rational development of viral entry inhibitors.","Radoshitzky, Sheli R.; Longobardi, Lindsay E.; Kuhn, Jens H.; Retterer, Cary; Dong, Lian; Clester, Jeremiah C.; Kota, Krishna; Carra, John; Bavari, Sina",PLoS One,89,8
649,649,649,Detection of a Fourth Orbivirus Non-Structural Protein,9.465088,7.943306,2011-10-12,"The genus Orbivirus includes both insect and tick-borne viruses. The orbivirus genome, composed of 10 segments of dsRNA, encodes 7 structural proteins (VP1–VP7) and 3 non-structural proteins (NS1–NS3). An open reading frame (ORF) that spans almost the entire length of genome segment-9 (Seg-9) encodes VP6 (the viral helicase). However, bioinformatic analysis recently identified an overlapping ORF (ORFX) in Seg-9. We show that ORFX encodes a new non-structural protein, identified here as NS4. Western blotting and confocal fluorescence microscopy, using antibodies raised against recombinant NS4 from Bluetongue virus (BTV, which is insect-borne), or Great Island virus (GIV, which is tick-borne), demonstrate that these proteins are synthesised in BTV or GIV infected mammalian cells, respectively. BTV NS4 is also expressed in Culicoides insect cells. NS4 forms aggregates throughout the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus, consistent with identification of nuclear localisation signals within the NS4 sequence. Bioinformatic analyses indicate that NS4 contains coiled-coils, is related to proteins that bind nucleic acids, or are associated with membranes and shows similarities to nucleolar protein UTP20 (a processome subunit). Recombinant NS4 of GIV protects dsRNA from degradation by endoribonucleases of the RNAse III family, indicating that it interacts with dsRNA. However, BTV NS4, which is only half the putative size of the GIV NS4, did not protect dsRNA from RNAse III cleavage. NS4 of both GIV and BTV protect DNA from degradation by DNAse. NS4 was found to associate with lipid droplets in cells infected with BTV or GIV or transfected with a plasmid expressing NS4.","Belhouchet, Mourad; Mohd Jaafar, Fauziah; Firth, Andrew E.; Grimes, Jonathan M.; Mertens, Peter P.

1425,1425,1425,In Silico Analysis Reveals Sequential Interactions and Protein Conformational Changes during the Binding of Chemokine CXCL-8 to Its Receptor CXCR1,9.903548,8.227724,2014-04-04,"Chemokine CXCL-8 plays a central role in human immune response by binding to and activate its cognate receptor CXCR1, a member of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family. The full-length structure of CXCR1 is modeled by combining the structures of previous NMR experiments with those from homology modeling. Molecular docking is performed to search favorable binding sites of monomeric and dimeric CXCL-8 with CXCR1 and a mutated form of it. The receptor-ligand complex is embedded into a lipid bilayer and used in multi ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. A multi-steps binding mode is proposed: (i) the N-loop of CXCL-8 initially binds to the N-terminal domain of receptor CXCR1 driven predominantly by electrostatic interactions; (ii) hydrophobic interactions allow the N-terminal Glu-Leu-Arg (ELR) motif of CXCL-8 to move closer to the extracellular loops of CXCR1; (iii) electrostatic interactions finally dominate the interaction between the N-terminal ELR motif of CXCL-8 and the EC-loops of CXCR1. Mutation of CXCR1 abrogates this mode of binding. The detailed binding process may help to facilitate the discovery of agonists and antagonists for rational drug design.","Liou, Je-Wen; Chang, Fang-Tzu; Chung, Yi; Chen, Wen-Yi; Fischer, Wolfgang B.; Hsu, Hao-Jen",PLoS One,89,1

We aimed at characterizing the liver pathology in CCHF virus-infected IFNAR(−/−) mice by immunohistochemistry and employed the model to evaluate the antiviral efficacy of ribavirin, arbidol, and T-705 against CCHF virus. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: CCHF virus-infected IFNAR(−/−) mice died 2–6 days post infection with elevated aminotransferase levels and high virus titers in blood and organs. Main pathological alteration was acute hepatitis with extensive bridging necrosis, reactive hepatocyte proliferation, and mild to moderate inflammatory response with monocyte/macrophage activation. Virus-infected and apoptotic hepatocytes clustered in the necrotic areas. Ribavirin, arbidol, and T-705 suppressed virus replication in vitro by ≥3 log units (IC(50) 0.6–2.8 µg/ml; IC(90) 1.2–4.7 µg/ml). Ribavirin [100 mg/(kg×d)] did not increase the survival rate of IFNAR(−/−) mice, but prolonged the time to death (p<0.001) and reduced the aminotransferase levels and the virus titers. Arbidol [150 mg/(kg×d)] had no efficacy in vivo. Animals treated with T-705 at 1 h [15, 30, and 300 mg/(kg×d)] or up to 2 days [300 mg/(kg×d)] post infection survived, showed no signs of disease, and had no virus in blood and organs. Co-administration of ribavirin and T-705 yielded beneficial rather than adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Activated hepatic macrophages and monocyte-derived cells may play a role in the proinflammatory cytokine response in CCHF. Clustering of infected hepatocytes in necrotic areas without marked inflammation suggests viral cytopathic effects. T-705 is highly potent against CCHF virus in vitro and in vivo. Its in vivo efficacy exceeds that of the current standard drug for treatment of CCHF, ribavirin.","Oestereich, Lisa; Rieger, Toni; Neumann, Melanie; Bernreuther, Christian; Lehmann, Maria; Krasemann, Susanne; Wurr, Stephanie; Emmerich, Petra; de Lamballerie, Xavier; Ölschläger, Stephan; Günther, Stephan",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,89,1
2009,2009,2009,Complete Genome and Phylogeny of Puumala Hantavirus Isolates Circulating in France,9.715995,7.941888,2015-10-22,"Puumala virus (PUUV) is the agent of nephropathia epidemica (NE), a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Europe. NE incidence presents a high spatial variation throughout France, while the geographical distribution of the wild reservoir of PUUV, the bank vole, is rather continuous. A missing piece of the puzzle is the current distribution and the genetic variation of PUUV in France, which has been overlooked until now and remains poorly understood. During a population survey, from 2008 to 2011, bank voles were trapped in eight different forests of France located in areas known to be endemic for NE or in area from where no NE case has been reported until now. Bank voles were tested for immunoglobulin (Ig)G ELISA serology and two seropositive animals for each of three different areas (Ardennes, Jura and Orleans) were then subjected to laboratory analyses in order to sequence the whole S, M and L segments of PUUV. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that French PUUV isolates globally belong to the central European (CE) lineage although isolates from Ardennes are clearly distinct from those in Jura and Orleans, suggesting a different evolutionary history and origin of PUUV introduction in France. Sequence analyses revealed specific amino acid signatures along the N protein, including in PUUV from the Orleans region from where NE in humans has never been reported. The relevance of these mutations in term of pathophysiology is discussed.","Castel, Guillaume; Couteaudier, Mathilde; Sauvage, Frank; Pons, Jean-Baptiste; Murri, Séverine; Plyusnina, Angelina; Pontier, Dominique; Cosson, Jean-François; Plyusnin, Alexander; Marianneau, Philippe; Tordo, Noël",Viruses,89,1
2039,2039,2039,Chikungunya nsP2 protease is not a papain-like cysteine protease and the catalytic dyad cysteine is interchangeable with a proximal serine,9.899086,8.077468,2015-11-24,"Chikungunya virus is the pathogenic alphavirus that causes chikungunya fever in humans. In the last decade millions of cases have been reported around the world from Africa to Asia to the Americas. The alphavirus nsP2 protein is multifunctional and is considered to be pivotal to viral replication, as the nsP2 protease activity is critical for proteolytic processing of the viral polyprotein during replication. Classically the alphavirus nsP2 protease is thought to be papain-like with the enzyme reaction proceeding through a cysteine/histidine catalytic dyad. We performed structure-function studies on the chikungunya nsP2 protease and show that the enzyme is not papain-like. Characterization of the catalytic dyad cysteine residue enabled us to identify a nearby serine that is catalytically interchangeable with the dyad cysteine residue. The enzyme retains activity upon alanine replacement of either residue but a replacement of both cysteine and serine residues results in no detectable activity. Protein dynamics appears to allow the use of either the cysteine or the serine residue in catalysis. This switchable dyad residue has not been previously reported for alphavirus nsP2 proteases and would have a major impact on the nsP2 protease as an anti-viral target.","Saisawang, Chonticha; Saitornuang, Sawanan; Sillapee, Pornpan; Ubol, Sukathida; Smith, Duncan R.; Ketterman, Albert J.",Sci Rep,89,1

The IC(50) values of the developed mAb for enrofloxacin (ENR), ciprofloxacin, difloxacin, sarafloxacin, pefloxacin, and norfloxacin were 5.0, 8.3, 9.7, 21.7, 36.0, and 63.7 ng/mL, respectively. The lowest detectable level of ENR was 0.7 ng/mL in the prepared ELISA system. To validate the developed ELISA in the food matrix, known amounts of ENR were spiked in meat and egg samples at 10, 20 and 30 ng/mL. Recoveries for ENR ranged from 72.9 to 113.16% with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 2.42 to 10.11%. The applicability of the mAb-MNP system was verified by testing the recoveries for ENR residue in three different matrices. Recoveries for ENR ranged from 75.16 to 86.36%, while the CV ranged from 5.08 to 11.53%.

2292,2292,2292,Structural basis for viral 5′-PPP-RNA recognition by human IFIT proteins,9.845054,7.9188504,2013-01-13,"IFIT proteins are interferon-inducible, innate immune effector molecules that are thought to confer antiviral defence through disruption of protein-protein interactions in the host translation initiation machinery. However, recently it was discovered that IFITs could directly recognize viral RNA bearing a 5′-triphosphate group (PPP-RNA), which is a molecular signature that distinguishes it from host RNA. Here, we report crystal structures of human IFIT5, its complex with PPP-RNAs, and an N-terminal fragment of IFIT1. The structures reveal a new helical domain that houses a positively charged cavity designed to specifically engage only single stranded PPP-RNA, thus distinguishing it from the canonical cytosolic sensor of double stranded viral PPP-RNA, RIG-I. Mutational analysis, proteolysis and gel-shift assays reveal that PPP-RNA is bound in a non-sequence specific manner and requires approximately a 3-nucleotide 5′-overhang. Abrogation of PPP-RNA binding in IFIT1 and IFIT5 were found to cause a defect in the anti-viral response by HEK cells. These results demonstrate the mechanism by which IFIT proteins selectively recognize viral RNA and lend insight into their downstream effector function.","Abbas, Yazan M.; Pichlmair, Andreas; Górna, Maria W.; Superti-Furga, Giulio; Nagar, Bhushan",Nature,89,11
2685,2685,2685,Structural basis for the specificity of USP18 towards ISG15,9.878222,7.909322,2017-02-06,"Protein modification by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like modifiers (Ubls) is counteracted by ubiquitin- and Ubl-proteases collectively called DUBs. In contrast to other proteases of the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) family, USP18 shows no reactivity towards ubiquitin but specifically deconjugates the interferon induced Ubl ISG15. To identify molecular determinants for this specificity, we solved the crystal structures of mouse USP18 and of mouse USP18 in complex with mouse ISG15. USP18 was crystallized in an open and a closed conformation revealing high flexibility of the enzyme. Structural data, biochemical and mutational analysis showed that only the C-terminal ubiquitin-like domain of ISG15 is recognized and essential for USP18 activity. A critical hydrophobic patch in USP18 interacts with a hydrophobic region unique to ISG15 providing evidence that ISG15 specificity of USP18 is mediated by a small interaction interface. Our results may provide the structural basis for the development of new drugs modulating ISGylation.","Basters, Anja; Geurink, Paul P.; Röcker, Annika; Witting, Katharina F.; Tadayon, Roya; Hess, Sandra; Semrau, Marta S.; Storici, Paola; Ovaa, Huib; Knobeloch, Klaus-Peter; Fritz, Günter",Nat Struct Mol Biol,89,1

3474,3474,3474,NSs Protein of Sandfly Fever Sicilian Phlebovirus Counteracts Interferon (IFN) Induction by Masking the DNA-Binding Domain of IFN Regulatory Factor 3,9.902959,7.925277,2018-11-12,"Sandfly fever Sicilian virus (SFSV) is one of the most widespread and frequently identified members of the genus Phlebovirus (order Bunyavirales, family Phenuiviridae) infecting humans. Being transmitted by Phlebotomus sandflies, SFSV causes a self-limiting, acute, often incapacitating febrile disease (“sandfly fever,” “Pappataci fever,” or “dog disease”) that has been known since at least the beginning of the 20th century. We show that, similarly to other pathogenic phleboviruses, SFSV suppresses the induction of the antiviral type I interferon (IFN) system in an NSs-dependent manner. SFSV NSs interfered with the TBK1-interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) branch of the RIG-I signaling pathway but not with NF-κB activation. Consistently, we identified IRF3 as a host interactor of SFSV NSs. In contrast to IRF3, neither the IFN master regulator IRF7 nor any of the related transcription factors IRF2, IRF5, and IRF9 were bound by SFSV NSs. In spite of this specificity for IRF3, NSs did not inhibit its phosphorylation, dimerization, or nuclear accumulation, and the interaction was independent of the IRF3 activation or multimerization state. In further studies, we identified the DNA-binding domain of IRF3 (amino acids 1 to 113) as sufficient for NSs binding and found that SFSV NSs prevented the association of activated IRF3 with the IFN-β promoter. Thus, unlike highly virulent phleboviruses, which either destroy antiviral host factors or sequester whole signaling chains into inactive aggregates, SFSV modulates type I IFN induction by directly masking the DNA-binding domain of IRF3. IMPORTANCE Phleboviruses are receiving increased attention due to the constant discovery of new species and the ongoing spread of long-known members of the genus. Outbreaks of sandfly fever were reported in the 19th century, during World War I, and during World War II. Currently, SFSV is recognized as one of the most widespread phleboviruses, exhibiting high seroprevalence rates in humans and domestic animals and causing a self-limiting but incapacitating disease predominantly in immunologically naive troops and travelers. We show how the nonstructural NSs protein of SFSV counteracts the upregulation of the antiviral interferon (IFN) system. SFSV NSs specifically inhibits promoter binding by IFN transcription factor 3 (IRF3), a molecular strategy which is unique among phleboviruses and, to our knowledge, among human pathogenic RNA viruses in general. This IRF3-specific and stoichiometric mechanism, greatly distinct from the ones exhibited by the highly virulent phleboviruses, correlates with the intermediate level of pathogenicity of SFSV.","Wuerth, Jennifer Deborah; Habjan, Matthias; Wulle, Julia; Superti-Furga, Giulio; Pichlmair, Andreas; Weber, Friedemann",J Virol,89,17

Here, based on a novel genomic analysis of 2625 different viruses and 439 corresponding host organisms, we provide evidence of universal evolutionary selection for high dimensional ‘silent’ patterns of information hidden in the redundancy of viral genetic code. RESULTS: Our model suggests that long substrings of nucleotides in the coding regions of viruses from all classes, often also repeat in the corresponding viral hosts from all domains of life. Selection for these substrings cannot be explained only by such phenomena as codon usage bias, horizontal gene transfer and the encoded proteins. Genes encoding structural proteins responsible for building the core of the viral particles were found to include more host-repeating substrings, and these substrings tend to appear in the middle parts of the viral coding regions. In addition, in human viruses these substrings tend to be enriched with motives related to transcription factors and RNA binding proteins. The host-repeating substrings are possibly related to the evolutionary pressure on the viruses to effectively interact with host's intracellular factors and to efficiently escape from the host's immune system.

Clinical symptoms, laboratory parameters and the outcome of the cases are presented and compared to international literature and to Yamagushi’s in 1992 proposed diagnostic criteria. Nine patients were reexamined in our out-patient clinic. The chart of one additional patient, who died 10 month after the initial symptoms was also available for data analysis. Retrospectively, it was investigated whether any parameters were predictive for a chronic or severe form of the disease. □ RESULTS: One patient died 10 month after the diagnosis was established due to a secondary haemophagozytic syndrome. One patient developed a chronic form of the disease, whereas 2 patients had a chronic-remitting form. Six patients presented a self-limiting, shorter than 12 month lasting course of AOSD with a restitutio ad integrum. All patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of Yamagushi et al. Three of 10 patients developed a chronic form of AOSD, compared to up to 70% of the patients reported by others. The patient who died was significantly older (46 years) than the average age (24,9 years) of all patients. Interestingly, he did not present Still’s rash or lymphadenopathy, but rather developed a secondary hemophagocytic syndrome with an excessive hyperferritinaemia. □ CONCLUSION: Predicting parameters for a chronic course of the disease could not be found. Each patient’s diagnosis retrospectively could be confirmed using the Yamagushi’s diagnostic criteria.

Neurotrichus, Parascalops, and Condylura have a simple middle ear cavity with a loose ectotympanic bone, ossicles of a “microtype” morphology, and they retain a small tensor tympani muscle. These characteristics are ancestral for talpid moles. Talpa, Scalopus, Scapanus, and Parascaptor species, on the other hand, have a looser articulation between malleus and ectotympanic bone and a reduced or absent orbicular apophysis. These species lack a tensor tympani muscle, possess complete bullae, and extensions of the middle ear cavity pneumatize the surrounding basicranial bones. The two middle ear cavities communicate in Talpa, Scapanus, and Parascaptor species. Parascaptor has a hypertrophied malleus, a feature shared with Scaptochirus but not found in any other talpid genus. Differences in middle ear morphology within members of the Talpidae are correlated with lifestyle. The species with middle ears closer to the ancestral type spend more time above ground, where they will be exposed to high‐frequency sound: their middle ears appear suited for transmission of high frequencies. The species with derived middle ear morphologies are more exclusively subterranean. Some of the derived features of their middle ears potentially improve low‐frequency hearing, while others may reduce the transmission of bone‐conducted noise. By contrast, the unusual middle ear apparatus of Parascaptor, which exhibits striking similarities to that of golden moles, probably augments seismic sensitivity by inertial bone conduction. J.

At the same time, studies of IL-4-secreting cell frequencies directly ex vivo have argued that T cells with the potential to become IL-4 secretors exist in vivo, in the form of precursors requiring stimulation and 4 – 12 days of culture as well as restimulation with mitogen or Ag before they become detectable as lymphokine-secreting cells. We demonstrate here that intravenous administration of low doses of anti-CD3 mAb 145-2C11 results in IL-4 production within 60 min of stimulation as demonstrated by Northern analysis of mRNA and a sensitive, selective bioassay (CT.4S cell proliferation) of biologically active IL-4 protein. Production of IL-4 is paralleled by IFNγ synthesis, displaying similar kinetics. These findings, consistent with the presence of mature cells capable of IL-4 and IFNγ synthesis in the T cell repertoire of naive mice, are supported by the observation that stimulation of spleen cells from naive mice with anti-CD3 mAb in vitro for 12 h also results in strong IL-4 and IFNγ mRNA and protein synthesis. The data support and extend those obtained through analysis of cytokine mRNA synthesis alone, thereby providing evidence that “fresh” T cells are indeed capable of producing IL-4 directly ex vivo and are consistent with the existence of IL-4-secreting cells as a normal component of the T cell repertoire of naive mice.","Wang, Hui; Mohapatra, Shyam S.; HayGlass, Kent T.",Immunol Lett,89,28

However, the effects of an individual PEEP-optimisation on respiratory mechanics, oxygenation and their potential correlation with the inflammatory response and postoperative complications have not been evaluated have not been compared to standard LPV in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. Thirty-nine patients undergoing open radical cystectomy were enrolled in this study. In the study group (SG) optimal PEEP was determined by a decremental titration procedure and defined as the PEEP value resulting the highest static pulmonary compliance. In the control group (CG) PEEP was set to 6 cmH2O. Primary endpoints were intraoperative respiratory mechanics and gas exchange parameters. Secondary outcomes were perioperative procalcitonin kinetics and postoperative pulmonary complications. Optimal PEEP levels (median = 10, range: 8–14 cmH2O), PaO2/FiO2 (451.24 ± 121.78 mmHg vs. 404.15 ± 115.87 mmHg, P = 0.005) and static pulmonary compliance (52.54 ± 13.59 ml cmH2O-1 vs. 45.22 ± 9.13 ml cmH2O-1, P < 0.0001) were significantly higher, while driving pressure (8.26 ± 1.74 cmH2O vs. 9.73 ± 4.02 cmH2O, P < 0.0001) was significantly lower in the SG as compared to the CG. No significant intergroup differences were found in procalcitonin kinetics (P = 0.076). Composite outcome results indicated a non-significant reduction of postoperative complications in the SG.

We reevaluated benefits of head-up positioning using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) with pulse oximetry in a pig model. Six pigs (mean ± SD weight: 25.3 ± 0.6 kg) were anesthetized with isoflurane and evaluated in four positions—supine, head-up, head-down, head-up to supine—just before apnea (positions’ order after “supine” was randomized). In each position, after 5 min of preoxygenation with 100% oxygen, apnea was induced and the time to SpO(2) < 70% measured. Hemodynamic and blood-gas variables and the cerebral tissue oxygenation index (TOI) were evaluated using NIRS and recorded. Hypovolemia was induced by collecting 600 mL blood. Apnea experiment was performed again in each position. The times (seconds) ± SD to SpO(2) < 70% were 108 ± 13 (supine), 138 ± 15 (head-up; P < 0.0001 vs all other positions); 101 ± 12 (head-down) and 106 ± 15 (head-up to supine) during normovolemia, and 110 ± 29, 120 ± 7 (not significant vs all other positions), 101 ± 16, and 106 ± 11, respectively, during hypovolemia. Although the TOI was not associated with the positions during normovolemia, the head-up position during hypovolemia decreased TOI from 62% ± 6% (supine) to 50% ± 9% (head-up; P = 0.0019) before preoxygenation, and it remained low during apnea. The head-up position improves preoxygenation, but repositioning to supine negates the benefits. Head-up positioning during evident hypovolemia should be avoided because the cerebral oxygenation could decrease.","Kurita, Tadayoshi; Kawashima, Shingo; Morita, Koji; Nakajima, Yoshiki",J Clin Monit Comput,89,19

The therapeutic potential of MSCs is attributed to complex cellular and molecular mechanisms of action including differentiation into multiple cell lineages and regulation of immune responses via immunomodulation. The plasticity of MSCs in immunomodulation allow these cells to exert different immune effects depending on different diseases. Understanding the biology of MSCs and their role in treatment is critical to determine their potential for various therapeutic applications and for the development of MSC-based regenerative medicine. This review summarizes the recent progress of particular mechanisms underlying the tissue regenerative properties and immunomodulatory effects of MSCs. We focused on discussing the functional roles of paracrine activities, direct cell–cell contact, mitochondrial transfer, and extracellular vesicles related to MSC-mediated effects on immune cell responses, cell survival, and regeneration.

SETTING: University Clinic for Traumatology, Orthopedics, Anesthesia and Intensive Care Unit and Emergency Center (TOARILUC), Mother Teresa, Skopje, FYROM. METHOD: During the inclusion period March 2015 to September 2016, 38 tSCI patients were included. MRI, CT scan, and clinical examinations including International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI were performed at admission. The information included: demographic data, transport type, date of admission and discharge, past illnesses, addiction habits, cause and type of injury, injury level, associated injuries, injury-related complications, and mortality. RESULTS: Mean age was 43 years (median 41, range 17–83). Seventeen patients had a complete and 15 an incomplete SCI, six were unknown. Most frequent causes for tSCI were traffic accidents (42%) and falls (40%), 24% of the accidents were contracted at work. Sixteen patients were ventilator dependent at some point during the acute period. Common complications were pressure ulcers, gastrointestinal-related, and infections. Hospital length of stay (LOS) ranged from 1 to 73 days. The in-hospital mortality rate was 32%. CONCLUSION: The annual incidence of tSCI in FYROM was in 2015–16 13 persons/million inhabitants per year. The epidemiological profile of tSCI in FYROM implies that preventive measures should be taken to reduce incidence of accidents in traffic and at work places.

This study aims to report outcomes, with focus on CLD, of preterm infants managed with a bubble CPAP (b-CPAP) bundle of care. METHODS: Infants <1500 g were stratified into four groups depending on intubation status through first 3 days of life. The incidence of mortality, CLD and other morbidities were compared over four chronological epochs. Outcomes of the most recent epoch were compared to contemporaneous benchmarks from Vermont Oxford Network (VON). RESULTS: Of 773 infants (median GA = 28 weeks, average BW = 995 g), 24.5% were intubated in DR and 11.7% in the first day of life. Mechanical ventilation, bCPAP and oxygen days in survivors were 1.5, 29 and 14, respectively. Overall incidence of CLD was 6.4% that remained consistent in the four epochs (7.6%, 7.5%, 5.8% and 5%), respectively. In comparison to VON, CLD was significantly less (p < 0.001). Initial DR intubation was not associated with increased CLD compared to initial management with CPAP that required subsequent intubation. CONCLUSION: It is feasible and sustainable to administer a b-CPAP bundle of care to decrease CLD. Cluster randomized trials are needed to validate the reproducibility of this approach.","Aly, Hany; Mohamed, Mohamed A.",Pediatr Res,89,1

However, disinfection guidelines for low-resource outbreak settings are inconsistent and not evidence-based. METHODS: A systematic review of surface disinfection efficacy studies was conducted to inform low-resource outbreak guideline development. Due to variation in experimental procedures, outcomes were synthesized in a narrative summary focusing on chlorine-based disinfection against seven pathogens with potential to produce outbreaks in low-resource settings (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella spp., hepatitis A virus, rotavirus, norovirus, Ebola virus). RESULTS: Data were extracted from 89 laboratory studies and made available, including 20 studies on relevant pathogens used in combination with surrogate data to determine minimum target concentration × time (“CT”) factors. Stainless steel (68%) and chlorine-based disinfectants (56%) were most commonly tested. No consistent trend was seen in the influence of chlorine concentration and exposure time on disinfection efficacy. Disinfectant application mode; soil load; and surface type were frequently identified as influential factors in included studies. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights that surface disinfection efficacy estimates are strongly influenced by each study's experimental conditions. We therefore recommend laboratory testing to be followed by field-based testing/monitoring to ensure effectiveness is achieved in situ.","Gallandat, Karin; Kolus, Riley C.; Julian, Timothy R.; Lantagne, Daniele S.",Am J Infect Control,89,28

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to obtain validity evidence for relationships to other variables, internal structure, and consequences of testing for the task scores of a new low-cost portable simulator mediated by gestures for learning basic psychomotor skills in minimally invasive surgery. This new simulator is called SIMISGEST-VR (Simulator of Minimally Invasive Surgery mediated by Gestures - Virtual Reality). METHODS: In this prospective observational validity study, the authors looked for multiple sources of evidence (known group construct validity, prior videogaming experience, internal structure, test-retest reliability, and consequences of testing) for the proposed SIMISGEST-VR tasks. Undergraduate students (n=100, reference group), surgical residents (n=20), and experts in minimally invasive surgery (n=28) took part in the study. After answering a demographic questionnaire and watching a video of the tasks to be performed, they individually repeated each task 10 times with each hand. The simulator provided concurrent, immediate, and terminal feedback and obtained the task metrics (time and score). From the reference group, 29 undergraduate students were randomly selected to perform the tasks 6 months later in order to determine test-retest reliability. RESULTS: Evidence from multiple sources, including strong intrarater reliability and internal consistency, considerable evidence for the hypothesized consequences of testing, and partial confirmation for relations to other variables, supports the validity of the scores and the metrics used to train and teach basic psychomotor skills for minimally invasive surgery via a new low-cost portable simulator that utilizes interaction technology mediated by gestures. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained provided multiple sources of evidence to validate SIMISGEST-VR tasks aimed at training novices with no prior experience and enabling them to learn basic psychomotor skills for minimally invasive surgery.","Alvarez-Lopez, Fernando; Maina, Marcelo Fabián; Arango, Fernando; Saigí-Rubió, Francesc",JMIR Serious Games,89,1

Little is known about the relationship between symptom co-occurrence with physical activity (PA) and exercise. Novel diagnostic tools are needed for accurate symptom discrimination. In this secondary analysis, we examined relationships between baseline assessments of pain, dyspnea, objectively measured PA, and exercise capacity in persons with COPD who previously enrolled in three PA studies. Pain was assessed with the bodily pain domain of the Veterans RAND-36 (VR-36), and dyspnea with the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale. Average daily step count was assessed with the Omron HJ-720ITC or FitBit Zip pedometer, and exercise capacity with 6-minute walk test (6MWT). We also conducted a pilot neuroimaging study. Neuroimaging data were acquired on a Siemens 3-Tesla Magnetom Prisma(fit) whole-body scanner. Analysis of variance assessed trends in daily step count and 6MWT distance across categories of co-occurring pain and dyspnea. General linear models examined relationships between cortical thickness and resting state functional connectivity (fc) with symptoms and functional status. In 373 Veterans, 98% were male with mean age 70.5± 8.3 years and FEV(1)% predicted 59 ± 21%. Compared to those with no co-occurrence of pain and dyspnea, those with co-occurrence walked 1,291–1,444 fewer steps per day and had an 80–85 m lower 6MWT distance. Ten males participated in the pilot neuroimaging study. Predominant findings were that lower cortical thickness and greater fc were associated with higher pain and dyspnea, p<0.05. Greater cortical thickness and lower fc were associated with higher daily step count and 6MWT distance, p<0.05. Regional patterns of associations differed for pain and dyspnea, suggesting that cortical thickness and fc may discriminate symptoms. Co-occurring dyspnea and pain in COPD are associated with significant reductions in PA and exercise capacity. It may be feasible for neuroimaging markers to discriminate between pain and dyspnea.","Moy, Marilyn L.; Daniel, Rinu A.; Cruz Rivera, Paola N.; Mongiardo, Maria A.; Goldstein, Rebekah L.; Higgins, Diana M.; Salat, David H.",PLoS One,89,1

This study evaluates the drivers of livestock farmers’ KBM of ADs from a sample of 629 respondents selected using a three-stage sampling procedure in Kenya’s three hotspot counties of Baringo, Kwale, and Kilifi. A multivariate fractional probit model was used to assess the factors influencing the intensity of KBM. Only a quarter of the farmers had any knowledge of ADs while over four-fifths of them could not manage any of the three diseases. Access to information (experience and awareness), income, education, religion, and distance to a health facility considerably influenced the intensity of farmers’ KBM of ADs in Kenya. Thus, initiatives geared towards improving access to information through massive awareness campaigns are necessary to mitigate behavioral barriers in ADs management among rural communities in Kenya.","Nyangau, Paul Nyamweya; Nzuma, Jonathan Makau; Irungu, Patrick; Kassie, Menale",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,89,28

These tasks include target identification and validation; screening for active compounds; chemical modification of candidate compounds to achieve optimized pharmacology; formulating the final drug product; and establishing safety in preclinical models. “Repurposing” drugs that have previously been approved (or shown to be safe in humans) for new clinical indications can provide a faster, less risky, and more cost-effective route for bringing a new therapy to patients. Such shortcuts in development can be particularly valuable to resource-constrained academicians. When performing drug discovery research, we must be particularly attentive to the robustness of our experiments, because inability to reproduce academic data continues to be a sticking point when projects are transferred to industry.

Roots and leaves of the plant contain several alkaloids including tylophorine, tylophorinine and tylophrinidine. The major alkaloid, tylophorine found in T. indica possesses several properties, such as immunosuppressive, antitumour, antifeedant, antibacterial, antifungal, antiamoebic, diuretic and hepatoprotective activities. In addition to this, tylophorine provides positive stimulation to adrenal cortex. Biotechnological production of tylophorine was fulfilled by inducing hairy roots mediated by Agrobacterium rhizogenes (A4 strain). It was followed by its growth in liquid suspension culture that could yield maximum biomass and tylophorine production. This type of liquid suspension culture yielded 9.8 ± 0.21 mgL(−1) tylophorine within 4–6 weeks of incubation. Maceration technique employed for the extraction of tylophorine was the most viable and efficient protocol.

This is particularly dramatic for workers at the beginning of the value chain. The violations of internationally recognized social and economic rights in global supply chains are more massive today than before the crisis and reveal a far-reaching potential for new conflicts. The article illustrates this situation in the case of Brazil and India and, on this basis, raises the issue of global supply chains as a topic for peace and conflict research. Supply chains are spaces of political conflict about material and ideological conditions of production, which are shaped by a variety of institutional contexts and actors. One of the most controversial issues is the lack of labour and human rights protection. The dominant way to address this lack is through institutions and practices of transnational private governance—standards, certification, monitoring and audits. In the pandemic, these already patchy approaches reveal that, especially in times of crisis, they are unsuitable for securing basic labour and human rights and for pacifying existing conflicts. The article concludes with an emphasis of the linkages between global supply chains and local conflicts and argues for an extended research agenda on “supply chains and conflict”.","Scheper, Christian; Vestena, Carolina A.",Z Friedens und Konflforsch,89,1

An increase of glycolysis pathway leading to pyruvate escalation is the mechanism of hyperlactatemia in β2-adrenergic agonist drug. CASE PRESENTATION: A 40-year-old man who had poor-controlled asthma, presented with progressive dyspnea with coryza symptom for 6 days. He was intubated and admitted into medical intensive care unit due to deteriorated respiratory symptom. Severe asthmatic attack was diagnosed and approximate 1.5 canisters of salbutamol inhaler was administrated within 24 h of admission. Initial severe acidosis consisted of acute respiratory acidosis from ventilation-perfusion mismatch and acute metabolic acidosis resulting from bronchospasm and hypoxia-related lactic acidosis, respectively. The lactate level was normalized in 6 h after hypoxemia and ventilation correction. Given the lactate level re-elevated into a peak of 4.6 mmol/L without signs of tissue hypoxia nor other possible etiologies, the salbutamol toxicity was suspected and the inhaler was discontinued that contributed to rapid lactate clearance. The patient was safely discharged on the 6th day of admission. CONCLUSION: The re-elevation of serum lactate in status asthmaticus patient who had been administrated with the vast amount of β2-adrenergic agonist should be considered for salbutamol-induced lactic acidosis and promptly discontinued especially when there were no common potentials.","Phoophiboon, Vorakamol; Singhagowinta, Parima; Boonkaya, Sangdao; Sriprasart, Thitiwat",BMC Pulm Med,89,17

Draft animals provided the labor to clear and cultivate the majority of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed by 1900. Pigs brought by English colonists became important sources of food for both the settlers and native peoples. Initially, introduced chickens played a persistent but minor role in the food system. This changed with the development of the chicken for meat (broiler) industry on the Bay’s Delmarva Peninsula in the 1920s. The broiler industry pioneered the use of concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) and vertical integration of all aspects of production, a model now dominating the entire livestock enterprise. This propelled a 50% rise in per capita consumption of animal-based foods and attendant rise in human diseases, particularly coronary artery disease. Industrialization of chicken also increased its share of the animal products market sevenfold. The broiler industry pioneered the use of antibiotics as growth promoters, resulting in development of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Poultry workers face various health problems, including increased rates of respiratory disease and certain cancers. The poultry industry is the major source of Salmonella poisoning. Broiler chickens suffer crowded and polluted conditions in CAFOs. These CAFOs dominate the landscape of the Delmarva, producing air and water pollution. Nitrogen as a waste product from the industry reaches the Bay and is a major source of eutrophication.","Cuker, Benjamin E.",Diet for a Sustainable Ecosystem,89,18

Cattle persistently infected (PI) with BVDV are mild or asymptomatic; however, they become a source of BVDV transmission to other cattle. Hence, it is important to rapidly identify and remove the PI animals from cattle herds. Whereas cattle acutely infected (AI) with BVDV have various symptoms, yet they generally recover within 3 weeks. However, there is a paucity of information concerning clinical characteristics of AI cattle. Further accumulation of information would be required to accurately diagnose AI cattle with BVDV. Here, we attempted to obtain valuable information via various analyses using a case report of BVD outbreak that occurred for approximately four months in Iwate Prefecture in 2017. Using eight calves and multiple tests (real-time RT-PCR, virus isolation, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and virus neutralization assay) over 6 weeks, we diagnosed the continuous BVD outbreak as an acute infection and not a persistent one. Additionally, we revealed that the sporadic case was caused by low pathogenic BVDV2 via BVDV genotyping and phylogenetic analysis. The data suggest that BVDV2 AI animals might also be a source of transmission to susceptible calves; hence, it might persist for a long period owing to multiple AI animals. These findings provide useful information to diagnose AI and PI cattle with BVDV in the field.","Goto, Yusuke; Yaegashi, Gakuji; Fukunari, Kazuhiro; Suzuki, Tohru",Viruses,89,1

Many of these viruses are of primary biosecurity concern to countries that import equines where these viruses are not present. In addition, several equine viruses are zoonotic, which can have a significant impact on human health. Current diagnostic techniques are both time consuming and laboratory-based. The ability to accurately detect diseases will lead to better management, treatment strategies, and health outcomes. This review outlines the current modern isothermal techniques for diagnostics, such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification and insulated isothermal polymerase chain reaction, and their application as point-of-care diagnostics for the equine industry. ABSTRACT: The global equine industry provides significant economic contributions worldwide, producing approximately USD $300 billion annually. However, with the continuous national and international movement and importation of horses, there is an ongoing threat of a viral outbreak causing large epidemics and subsequent significant economic losses. Additionally, horses serve as a host for several zoonotic diseases that could cause significant human health problems. The ability to rapidly diagnose equine viral diseases early could lead to better management, treatment, and biosecurity strategies. Current serological and molecular methods cannot be field-deployable and are not suitable for resource-poor laboratories due to the requirement of expensive equipment and trained personnel. Recently, isothermal nucleic acid amplification technologies, such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and insulated isothermal polymerase chain reaction (iiPCR), have been developed to be utilized in-field, and provide rapid results within an hour. We will review current isothermal diagnostic techniques available to diagnose equine viruses of biosecurity and zoonotic concern and provide insight into their potential for in-field deployment.","Knox, Alexandra; Beddoe, Travis",Animals (Basel),89,8

In the past decades, emergency decision-making (EDM) has become a research hotspot and a lot of studies have been conducted for better managing emergency events under tight time constraint. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of the literature on this topic. The objective of this paper is to provide academic community with a complete bibliometric analysis of the EDM researches to generate a global picture of developments, focus areas, and trends in the field. A total of 303 journal publications published between 2010 and 2020 were identified and analyzed using the VOSviewer in regard to cooperation network, co-citation network, and keyword co-occurrence network. The findings indicate that the annual publications in this research field have increased rapidly since 2014. Based on the cooperation network and co-citation network analyses, the most productive and influential countries, institutions, researchers, and their cooperation networks were identified. Using the co-citation network analysis, the landmark articles and the core journals in the EDM area are found out. With the help of the keyword co-occurrence network analysis, research hotspots and development of the EDM domain are determined. According to current trends and blind spots in the literature, possible directions for further investigation are finally suggested for EDM. The literature review results provide valuable information and new insights for both scholars and practitioners to grasp the current situation, hotspots and future research agenda of the EDM field.","Hou, Lin-Xiu; Mao, Ling-Xiang; Liu, Hu-Chen; Zhang, Ling",Complex Intell,89,19

METHODS Ten healthy female sheep were used to perform transvaginal NOTES-assisted right laparoscopic nephrectomy using a flexible 12-mm gastroscope through a vaginal access and two additional 5- and 10-mm trocars placed in the abdomen. The renal artery, the renal vein, and the ureter were dissected, and ligation was accomplished by using laparoscopic clips. The right kidney was retrieved transvaginally after enlarging the vaginal trocar incision. All data related with the surgical procedure, perioperative, and postoperative outcomes were recorded. The animals were monitored after surgery for a 30-day period with daily clinical follow-up. RESULTS We established a useful animal model of transvaginal NOTES-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy, performing the transvaginal approach and the abdomen exploration with no complications in any animals. The renal artery, the renal vein, and the ureter were identified, clipped, and transected combining the 5-mm laparoscopic access and the endoscopic vision in the whole group. Mean operative time was 86 ± 14.49 min, estimated blood loss was less than 20 ml in all cases, and there was no bleeding or laceration of adjacent organs. The animals recovered successfully in all cases postoperatively. After 1 month, exploratory laparotomy did not show alterations in abdominal cavity, and the vaginotomy incision healed completely in every animal. CONCLUSIONS This experiment shows that transvaginal NOTES-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy in ovine model is feasible and reproducible while offering an innovative possibility to help surgeons with this recent technology in the treatment of renal cancer. Well-managed experimental studies need to be carried out to determine the safety and efficacy of NOTES in the treatment of renal cancer.","Sánchez-Margallo, Francisco M; Pérez, Francisco J; Sánchez, Miguel A; Bachiller, Jaime; Juárez, Alvaro; Serrano, Alvaro; Ribal, María José; Alcaraz, Antonio",Surgical endoscopy,89,17

METHODS A 62-year-old female presented with a complex abdominal wall history having undergone a transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) flap breast reconstruction 10 years ago, followed by an abdominal wall repair with Marlex™ mesh for weakness 3 years later. Two years ago, she developed an abdominal bulge repaired with a Permacol™ overlay. Twenty-three months postoperatively, she presented with abdominal distension. Computed tomography (CT) scanning demonstrated a fluid collection behind the Permacol™. She underwent incision and drainage of the hematoma/bursa and quilting repair of the abdominal wall. A 1 × 6-cm Permacol™ section was resected as part of closure. Histology, immunohistochemistry, and mechanical testing of the Permacol™ explant were performed. RESULTS Histology showed fibroblast and blood vessel ingrowth with no cellular infiltrates reflective of inflammation. Immunohistochemistry for human-specific collagen types I and III and elastin detected staining throughout. Sections stained with non-specific control antibody exhibited no discernable staining. Elastin highlighted blood vessels. Native Permacol™ had a breaking strength of ~20 N, while for explanted Permacol™, it was ~33 N. CONCLUSIONS Permacol™ maintained durability while allowing vascular ingrowth without residual inflammation. Explant demonstrated integration with human collagen and elastin remodeling throughout. Increase in mechanical strength may reflect newly synthesized collagen and elastin. These histologic findings and clinical result support the use of Permacol™ in complex abdominal wall reconstruction.","O'Brien, J A; Ignotz, R; Montilla, R; Broderick, G B; Christakis, A; Dunn, R M",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,89,27

A recent study concluded that since 1924 in the United States alone, vaccines have prevented 40 million cases of diphtheria, 35 million cases of measles, and a total of 103 million cases of childhood diseases. A report from the World Health Organization states that today vaccines prevent 2.5 million deaths per year: Every minute five lives are saved by vaccines worldwide. Overall, vaccines have done and continue to do an excellent job in eliminating or reducing the impact of childhood diseases. Furthermore, thanks to new technologies, vaccines now have the potential to make an enormous contribution to the health of modern society by preventing and treating not only communicable diseases in all ages, but also noncommunicable diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. The achievement of these results requires the development of novel technologies and health economic models able to capture not only the mere cost-benefit of vaccination, but also the value of health per se.","Rappuoli, Rino; Pizza, Mariagrazia; Del Giudice, Giuseppe; De Gregorio, Ennio",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,89,19

We tested the hypothesis that eFat-EVs transmit proinflammatory, profibrotic, and proarrhythmic molecules that induce atrial myopathy and fibrillation. Methods: We collected eFat specimens from patients with (n=32) and without AF (n=30) during elective heart surgery. eFat samples were grown as organ cultures, and the culture medium was collected every two days. We then isolated and purified eFat-EVs from the culture medium, and analyzed the EV number, size, morphology, specific markers, encapsulated cytokines, proteome, and miRNAs. Next, we evaluated the biological effects of unpurified and purified EVs on atrial mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) in vitro. To establish a causal association between eFat-EVs and vulnerability to AF, we modeled AF in vitro using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iCMs). Results: Microscopic examination revealed excessive inflammation, fibrosis, and apoptosis in fresh and cultured eFat tissues. Cultured explants from patients with AF secreted more EVs and harbored greater amounts of proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines, as well as profibrotic miRNA, than those without AF. The proteomic analysis confirmed the distinctive profile of purified eFat-EVs from patients with AF. In vitro, purified and unpurified eFat-EVs from patients with AF had a greater effect on proliferation and migration of human MSCs and ECs, compared to eFat-EVs from patients without AF. Finally, while eFat-EVs from patients with and without AF shortened the action potential duration of iCMs, only eFat-EVs from patients with AF induced sustained reentry (rotor) in iCMs. Conclusions: We show, for the first time, a distinctive proinflammatory, profibrotic, and proarrhythmic signature of eFat-EVs from patients with AF. Our findings uncover another pathway by which eFat promotes the development of atrial myopathy and fibrillation.","Shaihov-Teper, Olga; Ram, Eilon; Ballan, Nimer; Brzezinski, Rafael Y; Naftali-Shani, Nili; Masoud, Rula; Ziv, Tamar; Lewis, Nir; Schary, Yeshai; Levin-Kotler, La-Paz; Volvovitch, David; Zuroff, Elchanan M; Amunts, Sergei; Regev-Rudzki, Neta; Sternik, Leonid; Raanani, Ehud; Gepstein, Lior; Leor, Jonathan",Circulation,89,31

Treatment of these bariatric patients raises unique challenges, and at this time there is still no consensus on the best treatment option. This study was performed in a high-volume bariatric and minimally invasive surgery center at a tertiary care facility in the USA. Twenty-eight morbidly obese patients treated at our facility between 2003 and 2008 were separated into four groups according to anatomic features and symptoms. Patients with the following characteristics were classified as having a favorable anatomy: body mass index not exceeding 50 kg/m(2), gynecoid body habitus, reducible hernias found in a central location, abdominal wall thickness less than 4 cm, and the defect's largest diameter not exceeding 8 cm. All other patients were classified as having an unfavorable anatomy. In this study, we report a systematic treatment approach for the morbidly obese patient presenting with a ventral hernia based on whether the hernia is symptomatic or asymptomatic, as well as the distinct characteristics of the hernia and body habitus features. We followed up on these patients postoperatively for at least 2 years, with a mean follow-up period of 30 months. Only a total of three hernia recurrences were observed. Successful treatment of ventral hernias in morbidly obese patients should be individualized based on the patient's symptoms and defined hernia characteristics.","Eid, George M; Wikiel, Krzysztof J; Entabi, Fateh; Saleem, Mark",Obesity surgery,89,9

Metaphylactic administration of antimicrobial reduces colonization of respiratory tract by pathogens, but the development of antibiotic-resistance raises public health concerns leading to propose new control strategies. The study analyzed nasopharyngeal swabs of 231 imported cattle, 10% of 49 trucks, transported from France to southern Italy and, through Real-time PCR identified the prevalence of the involved pathogens speculating on strategies to reduce the impact of BRD. The samples were tested by Real-time PCR, for the detection of bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine parainfluenza virus (BPiV), bovine adenovirus (BAdV), Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, and Mycoplasma bovis. Yates-corrected chi squared, or Fisher's exact test were used to compare both animal-health status and positivity/negativity to pathogens, and the relationship between presence/absence of clinical signs and Real-time PCR-positivity. H. somni and BCoV were the most frequently identified pathogens. In BRD-diagnosed cattle, BAdV was detected in 13.8% (19/138), BRSV in 14.5% (20/138) and BPiV in 4.3% (6/138). Healthy cattle were mostly positive for H. somni (89.2%, 83/93). A statistically significant association was observed between clinical signs and positivity to M. haemolytica (p value = 0.016). Although mass-medication and vaccination are used for BRD control, it still remains a primary health problem. Our results highlight that the nasopharyngeal microbiota could be affected by transport and that strategies to enhance calf immunity for reducing BRD-risk development would be more effective if applied at farm of origin prior to loading.","Pratelli, Annamaria; Cirone, Francesco; Capozza, Paolo; Trotta, Adriana; Corrente, Marialaura; Balestrieri, Anna; Buonavoglia, Canio",Research in veterinary science,89,1

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of CC inhibition on exercise cardiovascular and ventilatory function, and exercise tolerance in health and CHF. Methods Twelve clinically stable, optimally treated patients with CHF (mean ejection fraction: 43 ± 2.5%) and 12 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited. Participants completed two time-to-symptom-limitation (TLIM) constant load cycling exercise tests at 75% peak power output with either intravenous saline or low-dose dopamine (2 μg⋅kg-1⋅min-1; order randomized). Ventilation was measured using expired gas data and operating lung volume data were determined during exercise by inspiratory capacity maneuvers. Cardiac output was estimated using impedance cardiography, and vascular conductance was calculated as cardiac output/mean arterial pressure. Results There was no change in TLIM in either group with dopamine (CHF: saline 13.1 ± 2.4 vs. dopamine 13.5 ± 1.6 min, p = 0.78; Control: saline 10.3 ± 1.2 vs. dopamine 11.5 ± 1.3 min, p = 0.16). In CHF patients, dopamine increased cardiac output (p = 0.03), vascular conductance (p = 0.01) and oxygen delivery (p = 0.04) at TLIM, while ventilatory parameters were unaffected (p = 0.76). In controls, dopamine improved vascular conductance at TLIM (p = 0.03), but no other effects were observed. Conclusion Our findings suggest that the CC contributes to cardiovascular regulation during full-body exercise in patients with CHF, however, CC inhibition does not improve exercise tolerance.","Collins, Sophie É; Phillips, Devin B; McMurtry, M Sean; Bryan, Tracey L; Paterson, D Ian; Wong, Eric; Ezekowitz, Justin A; Forhan, Mary A; Stickland, Michael K",Frontiers in physiology,89,1

We compared the prevalence of brain injury between patients undergoing venoarterial and venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. DATA SOURCES PubMed and six other databases from inception to April 2020. STUDY SELECTION Observational studies and randomized clinical trials in adult patients undergoing venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation reporting brain injury. DATA EXTRACTION Two independent reviewers extracted the data from the studies. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to pool data. DATA SYNTHESIS Seventy-three studies (n = 16,063) met inclusion criteria encompassing 8,211 patients (51.2%) undergoing venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and 7,842 (48.8%) undergoing venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients had more overall brain injury compared with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (19% vs 10%; p = 0.002). Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients had more ischemic stroke (10% vs 1%; p < 0.001), hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (13% vs 1%; p < 0.001), and brain death (11% vs 1%; p = 0.001). In contrast, rates of intracerebral hemorrhage (6% vs 8%; p = 0.35) did not differ. Survival was lower in venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (48%) than venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (64%) (p < 0.001). After excluding studies that included extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation, no significant difference was seen in the rate of overall acute brain injury between venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (13% vs 10%; p = 0.4). However, ischemic stroke (10% vs 1%; p < 0.001), hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (7% vs 1%; p = 0.02), and brain death (9% vs 1%; p = 0.005) remained more frequent in nonextracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation compared with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. CONCLUSIONS Brain injury was more common in venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation compared with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. While ischemic brain injury was more common in venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients, the rates of intracranial hemorrhage were similar between venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Further research on mechanism, timing, and effective monitoring of acute brain injury and its management is necessary.","Shoskes, Aaron; Migdady, Ibrahim; Rice, Cory; Hassett, Catherine; Deshpande, Abhishek; Price, Carrie; Hernandez, Adrian V; Cho, Sung-Min",Critical care medicine,89,1

A considerable amount of abortion research exists in the region; however, the spread of existing evidence is uneven such that some countries have an acute shortage of data with others over-researched. The imbalance reflects the complexities in prioritization among researchers, academics, and funders, and undeniably impedes effective policy and advocacy efforts. This scoping review aims to identify and map the landscape of abortion research in SSA, summarize existing knowledge, and pinpoint significant gaps, both substantive and geographic, requiring further investigation. This review will provide direction for future research, investments, and offer guidance for policy and programming on safe abortion. MATERIALS AND METHODS We utilize the Joanna Briggs Institute's methodology for conducting scoping reviews. We will perform the search for articles in 8 electronic databases (i.e., PubMed, AJOL, Science Direct, SCOPUS, HINARI, Web of Knowledge, CINAHL, and WHO Regional Databases).

DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Summary data on 27 291 employees at a tertiary healthcare system in the Greater Houston metropolitan area between 15 December 2020 and 5 June 2021. The initial 12-week vaccination programme period (15 December 2020 to 6 March 2021) was defined as a rapid roll-out phase. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES At the pandemic onset, HCW testing and surveillance was conducted where SARS-CoV-2-positive HCWs were offered STDL. Deidentified summary data of SARS-CoV-2 infections and STDL utilisation among HCWs were analysed. Prevaccination and postvaccination trends in SARS-CoV-2 positivity and STDL utilisation rates were evaluated. RESULTS Updated for 5 June 2021, 98.2% (n=26 791) of employees received a full or partial dose of one of the approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. The vaccination rate during the rapid roll-out phase was approximately 3700 doses/7 days. The overall mean weekly SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates among HCWs were significantly lower following vaccine roll-out (2.4%), compared with prevaccination period (11.8%, p<0.001). An accompanying 69.8% decline in STDL utilisation was also observed (315 to 95 weekly leaves). During the rapid roll-out phase, SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate among Houston Methodist HCWs declined by 84.3% (8.9% to 1.4% positivity rate), compared with a 54.7% (12.8% to 5.8% positivity rate) decline in the Houston metropolitan area. CONCLUSION Despite limited generalisability of regional hospital-based studies-where factors such as the emergence of viral variants and population-level vaccine penetrance may differ-accounts of robust HCW vaccination programmes provide important guidance for sustaining a critical resource to provide safe and effective care for patients with and without COVID-19 across healthcare systems.","Vahidy, Farhaan S; Pan, Alan P; Hagan, Kobina; Bako, Abdulaziz T; Sostman, Henry Dirk; Schwartz, Roberta L; Phillips, Robert; Boom, Marc L",BMJ open,89,16

Although in silico docking studies, sequence-based computational studies, and experimental studies have shown the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission in cats, ferrets, and other domestic/wild animals, the results are not conclusive of infection under natural conditions. Identifying the potential host range of SARS-CoV-2 will not only help prevent the possibility of human-to-animal and animal-to-human transmission but also assist in identifying efficient animal models that can mimic the clinical symptoms, transmission potential, and pathogenesis of the disease.

BACKGROUND Patients with ESRD undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement have an operative mortality approaching 20% and a 10-year survival of approximately 12%. We investigated whether TAVR is a more reasonable option. METHODS This is a multicenter, retrospective study of all patients with ESRD who underwent TAVR in 8 institutions between 12/2011 and 02/2013. Demographic characteristics, mortality, major, and minor complications were evaluated. Outcomes were stratified by operative approach. RESULTS Forty-three patients with a mean age 76.2 ± 11.0 years and a mean STS predicted risk of mortality of 15.53 ± 8.70% underwent TAVR. Mean duration of dialysis was 45.2 ± 52.3 months (median 29.5 months). Transfemoral (TF) TAVR was performed in 31/43 (72.1%), transapical in 11/43 (25.6%), and transaortic in 1/43 (2.3%). Operative mortality was 14.0% (6/43) with TF mortality 6.5% (2/31) and 33.3% (4/12) in non-TF patients. Six-month mortality was 11/43 (25.6%: 16.1% TF, 50.0% non-TF). Complications included stroke in 2.3% (1/43) and life-threatening or major bleeding in 14.0% (6/43). Discharge to another healthcare facility was 27.0% (10/37). Readmission within 30 days of procedure for any cause was 18.9% (7/37). CONCLUSIONS Patients with ESRD who undergo TAVR are at high risk for mortality and complications. TAVR outcomes are comparable to but not substantially better than those with SAVR. Transfemoral TAVR seems to be at least as safe and effective as the current standard SAVR in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Szerlip, Molly; Kim, Rebeca J; Adeniyi, Tokunbo; Thourani, Vinod; Babaliaros, Vasilis; Bavaria, Joseph; Herrmann, Howard C; Anwaruddin, Saif; Makkar, Raj; Chakravarty, Tarun; Rovin, Joshua; Creighton, Don; Miller, D Craig; Baio, Kim; Walsh, Elizabeth; Katinic, Jasmina; Letterer, Rebecca; Trautman, Leigh; Herbert, Morley; Farkas, Robert; Rudolph, Jill; Brown, David; Holper, Elizabeth M; Mack, Michael",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,89,1

However, recurrence of BE after initially successful RFA is common, and outcomes following recurrence not well described. We report the outcomes associated with recurrence following initially successful RFA. METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study of 306 patients treated with RFA for dysplastic BE. Complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia (CE-IM) was defined as complete histological and endoscopic remission of IM. Recurrence was defined as any presence of IM or dysplasia in the tubular esophagus or dysplasia in the gastric cardia subsequent to CE-IM. We examined rates and risk factors for recurrence, dysplastic recurrence, and invasive adenocarcinoma after CE-IM. We also describe the clinical course of patients following recurrence. RESULTS Of the 306 eligible patients undergoing RFA, 218 achieved CE-IM and also had subsequent surveillance endoscopy. Of these, 52 (24%) experienced recurrence of IM or Barrett's-associated neoplasia over 540.6 person-years (incidence rate 9.6%/year). Thirty (58%) of these achieved second CE-IM; 4 (1.8% of total, 7.7% of recurrences) ultimately progressed to invasive adenocarcinoma (incidence rate 0.65%/year). Longer Prague M was a strong risk factor for invasive adenocarcinoma (rate ratio of 1.34/cm). Most dysplastic recurrences were in the cardia, and the majority were not visible but detected on random biopsies. CONCLUSIONS Most patients with recurrent BE after initially successful RFA achieve second CE-IM; however, 1.8% progressed to invasive adenocarcinoma. Longer Prague M was predictive of invasive adenocarcinoma. Four-quadrant random biopsy of the cardia is advisable during surveillance endoscopy after CE-IM.","Guthikonda, Athidi; Cotton, Cary C; Madanick, Ryan D; Spacek, Melissa B; Moist, Susan E; Ferrell, Kathleen; Dellon, Evan S; Shaheen, Nicholas J",The American journal of gastroenterology,89,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS From January 2006 to December 2007, 168 consecutive patients (133 male, 35 female; mean age 66.7 ± 10.1 years) with cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A/B [146/22]) who underwent RFA for treatment for recurrent intrahepatic HCC ≤5 cm, and in up to three nodules (214 HCCs; mean diameter 20.8 ± 7.5 mm; 38 multinodular forms), were included. Univariate and multivariate analyses for potential clinical, tumor-related, and radiologic factors affecting overall and recurrence-free patient survival were performed using the Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS Major complications occurred in 5 patients (5 of 168, 3.0 %), although there were no procedure-related deaths. Complete ablation was achieved in 161 patients (161 of 168, 95.8 %). After a mean follow-up period of 4 ± 21 months, local tumor progression, distant intrahepatic recurrence, and extrahepatic metastasis occurred in 22, 132, and 41 patients, respectively. Overall 5-year survival and recurrence-free survival were 48.0 and 11.9 %, respectively. Significant predicting factors for overall patient survival were Child-Pugh class B (relative risk [RR] = 4.52, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.97-10.34; P < 0.001), serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level (RR = 1.01, 95 % CI 1.01-1.01; P < 0.001), number of HCC nodules (RR = 1.70, 95 % CI 1.04-2.76; P = 0.033), tumor size (RR = 1.40, 95 % CI 1.07-1.83; P = 0.014), and presence of portosystemic collaterals (RR = 1.78, 95 % CI 1.09-2.92; P = 0.022). CONCLUSION RFA is a safe and effective treatment modality for recurrent intrahepatic HCC and has a 5-year survival rate of 48.0 %. Serum AFP level, Child-Pugh class, tumor number and size, and presence of portosystemic collaterals significantly affect overall patient survival.","Lee, Dong Ho; Lee, Jeong Min; Lee, Jae Young; Kim, Se Hyung; Han, Joon Koo; Choi, Byung Ihn",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,89,0

Overall rates of intervention for PAD have been rising steadily in recent years. Changing demographics, evolution of technologies, and an expanding database of outcomes studies are primary forces influencing clinical decision making in PAD. The management of PAD is multidisciplinary, involving primary care physicians and vascular specialists with varying expertise in diagnostic and treatment modalities. PAD represents a broad spectrum of disease from asymptomatic through severe limb ischemia. The Society for Vascular Surgery Lower Extremity Practice Guidelines committee reviewed the evidence supporting clinical care in the treatment of asymptomatic PAD and intermittent claudication (IC). The committee made specific practice recommendations using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system. There are limited Level I data available for many of the critical questions in the field, demonstrating the urgent need for comparative effectiveness research in PAD. Emphasis is placed on risk factor modification, medical therapies, and broader use of exercise programs to improve cardiovascular health and functional performance. Screening for PAD appears of unproven benefit at present. Revascularization for IC is an appropriate therapy for selected patients with disabling symptoms, after a careful risk-benefit analysis. Treatment should be individualized based on comorbid conditions, degree of functional impairment, and anatomic factors. Invasive treatments for IC should provide predictable functional improvements with reasonable durability. A minimum threshold of a >50% likelihood of sustained efficacy for at least 2 years is suggested as a benchmark. Anatomic patency (freedom from restenosis) is considered a prerequisite for sustained efficacy of revascularization in IC. Endovascular approaches are favored for most candidates with aortoiliac disease and for selected patients with femoropopliteal disease in whom anatomic durability is expected to meet this minimum threshold. Conversely, caution is warranted in the use of interventions for IC in anatomic settings where durability is limited (extensive calcification, small-caliber arteries, diffuse infrainguinal disease, poor runoff). Surgical bypass may be a preferred strategy in good-risk patients with these disease patterns or in those with prior endovascular failures. Common femoral artery disease should be treated surgically, and saphenous vein is the preferred conduit for infrainguinal bypass grafting. Patients who undergo invasive treatments for IC should be monitored regularly in a surveillance program to record subjective improvements, assess risk factors, optimize compliance with cardioprotective medications, and monitor hemodynamic and patency status.","Conte, Michael S; Pomposelli, Frank B; Clair, Daniel G; Geraghty, Patrick J; McKinsey, James F; Mills, Joseph L; Moneta, Gregory L; Murad, M Hassan; Powell, Richard J; Reed, Amy B; Schanzer, Andres; Sidawy, Anton N",Journal of vascular surgery,89,0

As regional and local governments, non-governmental organisations, communities and families and children grapple with the immediate public health impact of COVID-19, the rights and wellbeing of children, especially those who are already marginalised, have been overlooked. Those working with children have likely encountered unprecedented challenges and responded in innovative ways in efforts to address the needs and rights of all children. OBJECTIVE This paper presents the protocol for a large-scale, multinational study using a new smartphone app to capture the real-time experiences and perspectives of practitioners and policymakers supporting children and families during the COVID-19 pandemic around the globe in relation to a children's human rights '4P' framework of protection, provision, prevention and participation. METHODS This is a mixed-method survey study utilising a custom-built iOS and Android smartphone app called the 'COVID 4P Log for Children's Wellbeing', developed in close consultation with 17 international Key Partner organisations. Practitioners and policymakers working with and for children's wellbeing across 26 countries and 5 continents were invited to download the app and respond to 8 weeks of questions. The anticipated large amount of qualitative and quantitative response data will be analysed using content analysis, descriptive statistics and word frequencies. RESULTS The formal data collection for this project took place from October 2020 until March 2021. Results are expected in June 2021. CONCLUSIONS The findings will directly inform the understanding of the ways COVID-19 has impacted practitioners', managers' and policymakers' efforts to support children's wellbeing, in their practices, services and policies. Innovative and ambitious in its scope and use of smartphone technology, this project also aims to inform and inspire future multinational research using app-based methodologies-the demand for which is likely to continue to dramatically rise in the COVID-19 era. Mitigating the risks of longitudinal remote data collection will help maximise the acceptability of the app, respondents' sustained engagement and data quality.","Davidson, Jennifer C; Karadzhov, Dimitar; Wilson, Graham",JMIR research protocols,89,31

Key developments in detection of viruses, including electron microscopy and monolayer cell culture, were made in the middle of that century. However, in terms of patient care, the results from the virology laboratory often arrived the patient was 'better or dead'. The advent of molecular techniques, particularly polymerase chain reaction and more recently whole genome sequencing made timely and accurate diagnosis of viral infections feasible. A range of approaches have been taken to identify and characterise new viruses. Vaccines against viruses have made it possible to eliminate two pathogenic mammalian viruses altogether, with several others close to eradication.

Throughout the years different techniques and materials developed to address the complex anatomy of the ribs and reach an adequate fixation. Our aim is to present a prosthetic-free ribs stabilization technique which is easily reproducible and can achieve an efficient mechanical stabilization of the chest wall. Methods This surgical technique can be summarized in three steps: muscle sparing thoracotomy following modified ""Shaw-Paulson's"" technique (complete section of the latissimus dorsi muscle along the transverse processes of vertebral spine to rich the serratus muscles plane), prosthetic-free ribs fixation with single stiches (Maxon™ 1) and muscles repositioning. Results Between January 2018 and June 2020, we retrospectively evaluated ten consecutive patients (six male and four female) which underwent a chest wall stabilization because of a posterior ribs destruction and flail chest. No chest wall deformities were observed during follow-up with CT-scan after 4, 30 and 90 days and no patient underwent additional early or late stabilization procedures. Conclusions In the case of severe thoracic trauma with chest wall destruction and flail chest, modified ""Shaw-Paulson approach"" and prosthetic-free fixation technique with Maxon thread should be considered as a valuable option allowing an adequate stabilization of the chest with optimal respiratory function.","Girotti, Paolo N C; Tschann, Peter; Königsrainer, Ingmar",Journal of thoracic disease,89,24

DAR-901 represents a scalable manufacturing process for SRL172. We sought to determine if DAR-901 would prevent infection with M. tuberculosis among BCG-primed adolescents age 13-15 years in Tanzania. METHODS Adolescents with a negative T- SPOT.TBR interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) were randomized 1:1 to three intradermal injections of DAR-901 or saline placebo at 0, 2 and 4 months. Repeat IGRAs were performed at 2 months, and at 1, 2, and 3 years. The primary efficacy outcome was time to new TB infection (IGRA conversion to positive); the secondary outcome was time to persistent TB infection (IGRA conversion with repeat positive IGRA). RESULTS Among 936 participants screened 667 were eligible and randomized to their first dose of vaccine or placebo (safety cohort). At 2 months, 625 participants remained IGRA-negative and were scheduled for the additional two doses (efficacy cohort). DAR-901 was safe and well-tolerated. One DAR-901 recipient developed a vaccine site abscess. Neither the primary nor secondary endpoints differed between the two treatment arms (p = 0.90 and p = 0.20, respectively). DAR-901 IGRA converters had median responses to ESAT-6 of 50.1 spot-forming cells (SFCs) vs. 19.6 SFCs in placebo IGRA converters (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS A three-dose series of 1 mg DAR-901 was safe and well-tolerated but did not prevent initial or persistent IGRA conversion. DAR-901 recipients with IGRA conversion demonstrated enhanced immune responses to ESAT-6. Since protection against disease may require different immunologic responses than protection against infection a trial of DAR-901 to prevent TB disease is warranted.

Various interactions of antiseptic dressings with wound environments regarding antimicrobial efficacy remain unclear. Therefore, this work aimed to investigate the influence of human acute wound fluid (AWF) on the antimicrobial performance of different antiseptic foam dressings in vitro against typical bacterial wound pathogens. Eight antiseptic polyurethane foam dressings containing either a silver formulation or a polyhexamethylene-biguanide (PHMB) were assessed regarding their antimicrobial potency against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using a modified time-kill assay based on ISO EN 20743. The antiseptic efficacy was evaluated standardly as well as under the influence of human AWF after 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours. The specific chemical formulation and concentration of the antiseptic substance (ionic or nanocrystalline silver, silver sulfadiazine, PHMB 0.1%/0.5%) embedded within the dressings seemed to play a key role. For certain dressings (two nanocrystalline and one ionic silver dressing), the antimicrobial efficacy was significantly reduced under the influence of AWF compared to unchallenged test series. Unchallenged the efficacy of PHMB was comparable to silver against P. aeruginosa and even significantly superior against S. aureus and E. coli. Challenged with AWF the reduction rates for silver adjusted or even exceeded (P. aeruginosa) those of PHMB. Within a challenging wound environment, especially some silver formulations demonstrated a reduced bacterial reduction. Regarding the presented in vitro results, the biomolecular interactions of antiseptic wound dressings with wound fluid should be part of more extensive investigations, considering varying factors such as bacterial species and wound (micro)environment to develop targeted therapeutic regimes for the individual.","Rembe, Julian-Dario; Fromm-Dornieden, Carolin; Böhm, Julia; Stuermer, Ewa K",Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society,89,1

PATIENTS AND METHODS Specimens were collected from 200 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (disease group) and 200 normal children (control group) in our hospital. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood nucleated cells in both groups to detect the gene polymorphisms rs2069830 and rs2069836 of IL-6, as well as rs3024489 and rs3024493 of IL-10. Then, the content of serum IL-6 and IL-10 was determined via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS It was found that there were differences in the distribution of alleles of IL-6 gene polymorphism rs2069830 (p=0.000) and IL-10 gene polymorphism rs3024493 (p=0.007) between the disease group and control group. The frequency of T allele of IL-6 gene polymorphism rs2069830 was higher, while that of IL-10 gene polymorphism rs3024493 was lower in the disease group. Besides, the differences in the distribution of genotypes of IL-6 gene polymorphism rs2069830 (p=0.000) and IL-10 gene polymorphism rs3024493 (p=0.000) were also observed between the disease group and control group. Moreover, the disease group had higher frequencies of TT genotype of IL-6 gene polymorphism rs2069830 and TA genotype of IL-10 gene polymorphism rs3024493. The frequencies of dominant model of IL-6 gene polymorphism rs2069830 (p=0.048) and recessive model of IL-10 gene polymorphism rs3024493 (p=0.000) in the disease group were different from those in the control group. In addition, the frequency of CC + CT dominant model of IL-6 gene polymorphism rs2069830 was lower, and the frequency of TA + AA recessive model of IL-10 gene polymorphism rs3024493 was higher in the disease group. There were differences in haplotypes CG (p=0.001), CT (p=0.007), and TG (p=0.000) of IL-6 gene, as well as haplotypes AA (p=0.002) and AT (p=0.005) of IL-10 gene between disease group and control group. Furthermore, the content of IL-6 in the serum was associated with the genotypes of IL-6 gene polymorphism rs2069830 (p<0.05), whereas the children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia carrying CT genotype had remarkably higher content of serum IL-6. The genotypes of IL-6 gene polymorphism rs2069830 was notably related to white blood cell (WBC) (p=0.002), and the WBC level was higher in children with CT genotype. The genotypes of IL-10 gene polymorphism rs3024489 had prominent correlations with platelet (PLT) (p=0.043), and the children with AA genotype had a higher PLT level. In addition, the genotypes of IL-10 gene polymorphism rs3024493 were evidently correlated with hemoglobin, which was significantly higher in children carrying TA genotype. CONCLUSIONS The gene polymorphisms of IL-6 and IL-10 are significantly correlated with the susceptibility to and pathogenesis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","Liu, R-T; Wang, X-X; Sun, J-R; Gao, N; Yu, W-Z",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,89,17

METHODS All psychiatric admissions aged 65 or older in the 3 months before and after COVID-19 (from November 2019 to April 2020), in the previous 2 years (from November 2017 to April 2018 and from November 2018 to April 2019), and in the year of SARS (from November 2002 to April 2003) in a major gazette inpatient psychiatric unit in Hong Kong, which serves a catchment population of 1.4 million, were anonymously reviewed. The number of psychogeriatric admissions between different timeframes was compared, and factors that might explain the increase in admissions following COVID-19 were examined. RESULTS Psychogeriatric admissions increased by 21.4% following the COVID-19 outbreak. This increase was not explained by seasonal variation, and was greater and lasted longer than that in SARS. A rising trend in admissions for older adults living in residential care homes was observed. The increase in admissions was associated with fewer outpatient attendance, fewer home visits by nurses, and more older adults with dementia requiring inpatient care. CONCLUSIONS Our findings highlight the impact of COVID-19 on older adults' mental health, greater demand for inpatient psychogeriatric services in COVID-19 than in SARS, and the importance of maintaining support for community-living older adults, in particular those with dementia, and their caregivers in reducing the needs for inpatient psychiatric treatment during the pandemic.

METHODS A retrospective review of patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation for treatment of Barrett's Esophagus was performed. Data analyzed included patient demographics, medical history, length of Barrett's Esophagus, number of radiofrequency ablation sessions, and histopathology. Subsets of patients achieving complete eradication were compared with those not achieving complete eradication. RESULTS A total of 107 patients underwent radiofrequency ablation for Barrett's Esophagus, the majority white, overweight, and male. Before treatment, 63 patients had low-grade dysplasia, and 44 patients had high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma. Complete eradication was achieved in a majority of patients (57% for metaplasia, and 76.6% for dysplasia). Failure of eradication occurred in 15.7% of patients. The median number of radiofrequency ablation treatments in patients achieving complete eradication was 3 sessions, compared to 4 sessions for failure of eradication (p = 0.06). Barrett's esophagus length of more than 5 cm was predictive of failure of eradication (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Radiofrequency ablation for dysplastic Barrett's Esophagus is a proven and effective treatment modality, associated with a high rate of complete eradication. Our rates of eradication from a center starting an ablation program are comparable to previously published studies. Length of Barrett's segment > 5 cm was found to be predictive of failure of eradication in patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation.","Luckett, Tyler; Allamneni, Chaitanya; Cowley, Kevin; Eick, John; Gullick, Allison; Peter, Shajan",BMC gastroenterology,89,16

Depletion of noradrenaline and dopamine, or of acetylcholine from the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC), is as devastating as removing the cortex itself, and serotonergic influences are also critical to proper functioning of the orbital and medial PFC. Most neuromodulators have a narrow inverted U dose response, which coordinates arousal state with cognitive state, and contributes to cognitive deficits with fatigue or uncontrollable stress. Studies in monkeys have revealed the molecular signaling mechanisms that govern the generation and modulation of mental representations by the dlPFC, allowing dynamic regulation of network strength, a process that requires tight regulation to prevent toxic actions, e.g., as occurs with advanced age. Brain imaging studies in humans have observed drug and genotype influences on a range of cognitive tasks and on PFC circuit functional connectivity, e.g., showing that catecholamines stabilize representations in a baseline-dependent manner.

A myriad of factors, namely, genetic, metabolic, immunological, and inflammatory, is associated with progression of periodontitis. Periodontitis is also associated with systemic conditions such as neoplastic disorders, obesity, and diabetes. The current diagnosis of this disease relies on clinical measurements such as clinical attachment loss and probing depth, which have poor precision due to patient, operator and probe-related factors. Thus, there is a need to develop reliable, objective, and reproducible biomarkers for early diagnosis of periodontitis. In this regard, saliva, with contributions from the gingival crevicular fluid, holds great potential. However, most of the information on biomarkers of periodontium-related salivary proteins has come from studies on the molecular pathogenesis of periodontitis. In periodontitis, a more holistic approach, such as the use of -omics technologies, for biomarker discovery, is needed. Herein, we review the biomarkers proposed to date for the assessment of periodontitis, with emphasis on the role of salivary peptides in periodontitis and their assessment by high-throughput saliva proteomics. We also discuss the challenges pertaining to the identification of new periodontitis biomarkers in saliva.","Hirtz, Christophe; O'Flynn, Robin; Voisin, Pierre Marie; Deville de Périère, Dominique; Lehmann, Sylvain; Guedes, Sofia; Amado, Francisco; Ferreira, Rita; Trindade, Fábio; Vitorino, Rui",Critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences,89,1

Written benefit finding is known to improve psychological and physical health in a range of patient groups. Here, we tested the efficacy of written benefit finding, delivered online during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown, on mood and physical symptoms. We also investigated perseverative thinking as a moderator of these effects. Design. A quantitative longitudinal design was employed. Main Outcome Measures. Participants (n = 91) completed self-report measures of anxiety, depression, stress and physical symptoms at baseline, and two weeks after being randomised to complete three consecutive days of writing about the positive thoughts and feelings they experienced during the pandemic (written benefit finding) or to unemotively describe the events of the previous day (control). State anxiety was measured immediately before and after writing. Perseverative thinking was measured at baseline. Results. Anxiety and depression symptoms decreased between baseline and the two week follow-up, but did not differ significantly between the two conditions. Perseverative thinking was negatively associated with changes in symptoms of anxiety, depression and stress, but did not moderate any writing effects. There was a significant reduction in state anxiety in the written benefit finding condition. Conclusions. Written benefit finding may be a useful intervention for short-term improvements in wellbeing.","Hansen, Sarah R; Wetherell, Mark A; Smith, Michael A",Psychology & health,89,12

High-throughput and robust methods are being developed for the accurate measurement of metabolites associated with disease. Traditionally, quantitative assays have utilized triple quadrupole (QQQ) MS based methods; however, the use of such focused methods removes the ability to perform discovery-based metabolic phenotyping. An integrated workflow for the hybrid simultaneous quantification of 34 biogenic amines in combination with full scan high-resolution accurate mass (HRAM) exploratory metabolic phenotyping is presented. Primary and secondary amines are derivatized with 6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate prior to revered-phase liquid chromatographic separation and mass spectrometric detection. Using the HRAM-MS data, retrospective phenotypic data mining could be performed, demonstrating the versatility of HRAM-MS instrumentation in a clinical and molecular epidemiological environment. Quantitative performance was assessed using two MS detector platforms: Waters TQ-XS (QQQ; n = 3) and Bruker Impact II QToF (HRAMS-MS; n = 2) and three human biofluids (plasma, serum and urine). Finally, each platform was assessed using a certified external reference sample (NIST SRM 1950 plasma). Intra- and inter-day accuracy and precision were comparable between the QQQ and QToF instruments (<15%), with excellent linearity (R2 > 0.99) over the quantification range of 1-400 μmol L-1. Quantitative values were comparable across all instruments for human plasma, serum and urine samples, and calculated concentrations were verified against certified reference values for NIST SRM 1950 plasma as an external reference. As a real-life biological exemplar, the method was applied to plasma samples obtained from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients versus healthy controls. Both the QQQ and QToF approaches were equivalent in being able to correctly classify SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Critically, the use of HRAM full scan data was also assessed for retrospective exploratory mining of data to extract additional biogenic amines of biomarker interest beyond the 34 quantified targets.","Gray, Nicola; Lawler, Nathan G; Yang, Rongchang; Morillon, Aude-Claire; Gay, Melvin C L; Bong, Sze-How; Holmes, Elaine; Nicholson, Jeremy K; Whiley, Luke",Talanta,89,8

However, a pragmatic approach comparing manipulation to mobilization has not been examined in a patient population with cervicogenic headache. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effectiveness of manipulation compared to mobilization applied in a pragmatic fashion for patients with cervicogenic headache. METHODS Forty-five (26 females) patients with cervicogenic headache (mean age 47.8 ± SD 16.9 years) were randomly assigned to receive either pragmatically selected manipulation or mobilization. Outcomes were measured at baseline, the second visit, discharge, and 1-month follow-up and included the Neck Disability Index (NDI), Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6), the Global Rating of Change (GRC), the Patient Acceptable Symptoms Scale (PASS). The primary aim (effects of treatment on disability and pain were examined with a mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA), with treatment group (manipulation versus mobilization) as the between subjects variable and time (baseline, 48 hours, discharge and follow-up) as the within subjects variable. RESULTS The interaction for the mixed model ANOVA was not statistically significant for NDI (p = 0.91), NPRS (p = 0.81), or HIT (p = 0.89). There was no significant difference between groups for the GRC or PASS.

In this study, computational fluid dynamics was applied to in vivo data to provide quantitative insight into the hemodynamic response of the deep venous system to static external compression. The geometry and flow information of deep veins before and after compression was acquired from ten healthy volunteers using magnetic resonance imaging. Our results indicated that application of the compression stocking led to a small reduction in blood flow rate but a significant reduction in cross-sectional area of the peroneal veins in the calf, resulting in an increase in wall shear stress (WSS), but the individual effects were highly variable. The mean volume reduction of the deep veins was 58%, while the time-averaged WSS showed an average increase of 398% after compression (median 98%). The analysis also showed a strong linear correlation between the time-averaged WSS and mean blood velocity, suggesting that flow in the deep veins under the level of compression examined here can be approximated by Poiseuille's law despite local geometric variations. It is hoped that quantitative analysis of WSS in the deep venous system will aid in the future design and optimisation of the compression stocking.","Wang, Ying; Pierce, Iain; Gatehouse, Peter; Wood, Nigel; Firmin, David; Xu, Xiao Yun",Medical engineering & physics,89,19

The objective of this study was to examine the global association between lifestyle related factors and COVID-19 mortality using data from each individual country. Methods: The association between prevalence of seven lifestyle related factors (overweight, insufficient physical activity, smoking, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and age over 65) and COVID-19 mortality was assessed by linear and multivariable regression among 186 countries. The cumulative effect of lifestyle related factors on COVID-19 mortality was assessed by dividing countries into four categories according to the number of lifestyle related factors in the upper half range and comparing the mean mortality between groups. Results: In linear regression, COVID-19 mortality was significantly associated with overweight, insufficient physical activity, hyperlipidemia, and age [≥]65. In multivariable regression, overweight and age [≥]65 demonstrated significant association with COVID-19 mortality (P = 0.0039, 0.0094). Countries with more risk factors demonstrated greater COVID-19 mortality (P for trend <0.001). Conclusion: Lifestyle related factors, especially overweight and elderly population, were associated with increased COVID-19 mortality on a global scale.

From a study preceding this pandemic, this article seeks to better understand the experiences lived by domestic tourists from when they visited two typical protected natural parks as specific experiential contexts (extraordinary versus ordinary) providing different experiences. Each experiential context enables the distinction of actual visitors’ experiences inside each park—education, esthetics, entertainment, escapism, physical activity—differentiated, on one hand by the visitors’ participation axis and, on the other hand, by the absorption-immersion axis influencing the visitors’ arousal and memory. A structural equation model tested the data collected (n = 1000) in both experiential contexts and shows their moderator effect. The results underline the link between the experiential context and the actual experiences and highlight the interest of a new global framework including the visitors’ participation and a bodily axis relative to the specific context.

As a significant growth driver of the economy, the domestic construction industry employs nearly one million of the population directly in various trades. Unfortunately, almost every project has been severely hampered. It is, therefore, prudent to address the impact of the pandemic on construction labour at the outset and end of the crisis to prepare for any future challenges or opportunities that it may undergo. This study aims to investigate the effect of COVID-19 on the construction industry's survival and possible measures to be taken in both the short and the long run. This paper summarizes using a narrative analysis of the key takeaways of 15 webinar discussions on the COVID-19 impact and outlook of the construction sector in Sri Lanka. The impacts and fallouts have been addressed by key industry personnel. The study found the most prominent impacts of COVID-19 are the suspension of projects, labour impact, and job loss, time overrun, cost overrun, and delay in payments. The findings of this study shed light on the consequences of the sudden occurrence of a pandemic and raise awareness of the most critical impacts which cannot be overlooked.

Excessive neutrophil influx is a critical pathogenic factor in the development of ALI. Here, we identify the subset of neutrophils that is responsible for ALI and lethality in polymicrobial sepsis. The pro-inflammatory neutrophil subpopulation was characterized by its unique ability to endocytose albumin nanoparticles (ANP), upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines as well as the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in models of endotoxemia and septicemia. ANP delivery of the drug piceatannol, a spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) inhibitor, to the susceptible subset of neutrophils, prevented ALI and mortality in mice subjected to polymicrobial infection.

Application of Oxford Nanopore Technologies’ MinION sequencer has the potential to fulfil this requirement. We have developed a multiplexing assay which pools PCR amplicons for MinION sequencing to enable sequencing of multiple templates from multiple individuals which could be applied to gene-targeted diagnostics. Methods A combined strategy of barcoding and sample pooling was developed for simultaneous multiplex MinION sequencing of 100 PCR amplicons, spanning 30 loci in DNA isolated from 82 neurodevelopmental cases and family members. The target regions were chosen for further interegation because a potentially disease-causative variants had been identified in affected individuals by Illumina exome sequencing. The pooled MinION sequences were deconvoluted by aligning to custom references using the guppy aligner software. Results Our multiplexing approach produced interpretable and expected sequence from 29 of the 30 targeted genetic loci. The sequence variant which was not correctly resolved in the MinION sequence was adjacent to a five nucleotide homopolymer. It is already known that homopolymers present a resolution problem with the MinION approach. Interstingly despite equimolar quantities of PCR amplicon pooled for sequencing, significant variation in the depth of coverage (139x – 21,499x; mean = 9,050, std err = 538.21) was observed. We observed independent relationships between depth of coverage and target length, and depth of coverage and GC content. These relationships demonstrate biases of the MinION sequencer for longer templates and those with lower GC content. Conclusion We demonstrate an efficient approach for variant discovery or confirmation from short DNA templates using the MinION sequencing device. With less than 140x depth of coverage required for accurate genotyping, the methodology described here allows for rapid highly multiplexed targeted sequencing of large numbers of samples in a minimally equipped laboratory.","Whitford, Whitney; Hawkins, Victoria; Moodley, Kriebashne; Grant, Matthew J.; Lehnert, Klaus; Snell, Russell G.; Jacobsen, Jessie C.",bioRxiv,89,17

The incompatibility of web-based platforms with such experimental regimes would seem to preclude online auditory psychophysical paradigms, where success may hinge on absolute sound presentation level, reliably estimated perceptual thresholds, and sustained motivation and attention. Here, we introduce and validate a set of procedures that address these challenges and facilitate successful online auditory psychophysics. First, we establish a simple means of setting sound presentation levels where online participants serve as their own sound level meter. Across a set of three experiments conducted in person, we demonstrate the stability and robustness of this volume setting procedure both ‘in the wild’ and in controlled settings. Second, we test participants’ tone-in-noise thresholds using widely adopted online experiment platforms, and demonstrate that reliable threshold estimates can be derived in approximately one minute of testing. Third, using these sound level setting and thresholding procedures to establish participant-specific stimulus conditions, we show that frequency- selective attention can be reliably demonstrated in individual participants with an online implementation of the classic, yet challenging, probe signal psychophysics paradigm. Finally, we show how threshold and attentional measures relate to well-validated assays of participants’ in-task motivation, fatigue, and confidence.

This paper outlines the evaluation of the telesimulation component of a programme that was designed as a solution to COVID-19 restriction. Methods: A mixed methods approach was used to evaluate the telesimulation educational activities. Via a post-course online survey student were asked to rate the pre-simulation preparation, level of engagement, confidence in recognising and responding to the four clinical presentations and to evaluate telesimulation as a tool to prepare for working in the clinical environment. Students responded to open-ended questions describing their experience in greater depth. Results: Forty-two (72.4%) out of 58 students responded. 97.62% agreed that participating in the simulation was interesting and useful and 90.48% felt that this will provide a good grounding prior to clinical work. Four key themes were identified: Fidelity, Realism, Engagement and Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes Outcomes. Limitations of telesimulation included the inability to examine patients, perform procedures and experience non-verbal cues of team members and patients;but this emphasised importance of non-verbal cues and close looped communication. Additionally, designing the telesimulation according to defined objectives and scheduling it after the theory teaching contributed to successful execution. Conclusion: Telesimulation is an effective alternative when in-person teaching is not possible and if used correctly, can sharpen non-tactile aspects of clinical care such as history taking, executing treatment algorithms and team communication.

The current knowledge of the classification of silkworm hemocytes mainly comes from morphology rather than specific markers, so our understanding of the detailed classification, hemocyte lineage and functions of silkworm hemocytes is very incomplete. Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) is a representative member of the baculoviruses, which are a major pathogens that specifically infects silkworms and cause serious loss in sericulture industry. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of silkworm hemocytes in BmNPV and mock-infected larvae to comprehensively identify silkworm hemocyte subsets and determined specific molecular and cellular characteristics in each hemocyte subset before and after viral infection. A total of 19 cell clusters and their potential marker genes were identified in silkworm hemocytes. Among these hemocyte clusters, clusters 0, 1, 2, 5 and 9 might be granulocytes (GR); clusters 14 and 17 were predicted as plasmatocytes (PL); cluster 18 was tentatively identified as spherulocytes (SP); and clusters 7 and 11 could possibly correspond to oenocytoids (OE). In addition, all of the hemocyte clusters were infected by BmNPV and some infected cells carried high viral-load in silkworm larvae at 3 day post infection (dpi). Interestingly, BmNPV infection can cause severe and diverse changes in gene expression in hemocytes. Cells belonging to the infection group mainly located at the early stage of the pseudotime trajectories.

However, studies have demonstrated poor humoral response to SARS-CoV2 mRNA vaccine in immunocompromised patients and data on cellular immune response are currently lacking. Here we compared immune response after 2-dose vaccination in 100 immunocompromised patients (solid organ transplant recipients, hematologic malignancy, autoimmune condition, and primary immunodeficiency) and 16 immunocompetent healthy healthcare workers. We find that 100% (CI=80.6-100%) of immunocompetent individuals show positive cell-mediated and humoral immune response post vaccination while only 50% (CI=40.4-59.6%) of immunocompromised patients show humoral immune response and 69% (CI=59.4-77.2%) have a positive cell-mediated immune response. 21% of immunocompromised patients have no humoral immune response or cell-mediated immune response and thus are likely vulnerable to SARS-CoV2 infection. Monitoring of immune response in immunocompromised populations, particularly in high-risk immunocompromised patients (solid organ transplant recipients, patients with severe autoimmunity, and those [≥]50 years), with clinical IGRA and serological assay after vaccination may identify patients who may benefit from revaccination or prophylactic monoclonal antibody therapy to prevent COVID-19 in this patient population","Ramanathan, M.; Murugesan, K.; Yang, L.

The virus transmits rapidly; it has a basic reproductive number R of 2.2-2.7. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. COVID-19 is currently affecting more than 200 countries with 6M active cases. An effective testing strategy for COVID-19 is crucial to controlling the outbreak but the demand for testing surpasses the availability of test kits that use Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). In this paper, we present a technique to screen for COVID-19 using artificial intelligence. Our technique takes only seconds to screen for the presence of the virus in a patient. We collected a dataset of chest X-ray images and trained several popular deep convolution neural network-based models (VGG, MobileNet, Xception, DenseNet, InceptionResNet) to classify the chest X-rays. Unsatisfied with these models, we then designed and built a Residual Attention Network that was able to screen COVID-19 with a testing accuracy of 98% and a validation accuracy of 100%. A feature maps visual of our model show areas in a chest X-ray which are important for classification. Our work can help to increase the adaptation of AI-assisted applications in clinical practice.

There is limited evidence on the effect of various vaccines on the human reproductive system. Potential adverse effects of vaccines on fertility are associated with autoimmune disorders, which might cause gonadal damage. Currently, several studies are underway investigating the impact of COVID-19 vaccines on human fertility. To our best knowledge, there is only one study published which demonstrated no adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccine on assisted reproductive technology outcomes. Aim. To investigate the effect of the Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V) vaccine on ovarian reserve and antiphospholipid antibody level in reproductive-age women. Materials and methods. The prospective study included 51 women vaccinated against COVID-19 with Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V) vaccine. The inclusion criteria were age from 18 to 45, preserved menstrual function, normal ovarian reserve, no history of COVID-19, negative PCR test result for SARS-CoV-2 and negative SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody test before vaccination, no pregnancy, and no history of serious illnesses. Clinical evaluation was carried out twice-immediately before immunization and 90 days after the first vaccine component administration. The antral follicle count was measured by pelvic ultrasound. Serum levels of AMH, FSH, TSH, estradiol, antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) M and G isotypes against cardiolipin (aCL), β2-glycoprotein-1 (aβ2-GP-1), annexin V (aAn V), phosphatidylserine (aPS), and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were measured by enzyme immunoassay. Results. There were no significant changes in hormones levels and antral follicle counts before and after vaccination, including in women of advanced reproductive age (≥37 years). After immunization, aPL antibody levels did not differ significantly from the baseline. There was no correlation between aPL antibody level dynamics and level of FSH and AMH, which indirectly demonstrates no possible autoimmune effect of vaccination on women's fertility. Conclusion. This is the first study investigating the effect of the Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine on ovarian reserve parameters and aPL antibody levels. The preliminary results prove that the Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine in women of reproductive age does not adversely impact ovarian reserve.","Dolgushina, N. V.; Drapkina, Yu S.; Krechetova, L.

However, there is limited information about this disease in children and adolescents. Only a few pediatric cases of COVID-19 have been reported so far. Since the immune responses of children are different from adults, their clinical findings and therapeutic responses may differ. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in a 12-year-old girl with abdominal pain in Iran. CASE PRESENTATION: A 12-year-old girl with a history of cold, dry cough, sore throat, fever, and left-sided abdominal pain was referred to the Children’s Medical Center, Tehran, Iran, on March 7, 2020. The chest X-ray indicated air space opacification in the right lower lobe and faint ground-glass opacity in the left lower lung. A subsequent chest computed tomography (CT) scan indicated blialteral patchy lower lobe consolidations. The patient’s oropharyngeal swab was positive for COVID-19, based on the result of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. The patient’s clinical status was improved, and she was discharged five days after admission (March 11, 2020). CONCLUSION: Since the number of infected cases with COVID-19 is growing rapidly in Iran, early detection and management of infected cases are highly recommended for preventing the disease transmission and reducing the rate of infection.","Mahmoudi, Shima; Rostamyan, Maryam; Aziz-Ahari, Alireza; Pourakbari, Babak; Ghaffari, Mohammad; Mamishi, Setareh",Tanaffos,89,4

Inflammatory cytokines, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), along with transcription factor, nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) in young (n=16, 21.1±2.1 years) individuals were examined in a cross-sectional descriptive study, to assess the effects of chronic stimulation on their expression and relationship with health parameters. METHODS: Fasting venous whole blood and lipid levels along with body composition measurements were obtained from young, healthy, endurance-trained NCAA Division III student-athletes and untrained individuals. Assays (ELISA) were conducted to analyze fasting plasma (CRP, IL-6, and TNFα) and isolated lymphocyte NF-κB activation (lymphocytes were isolated from whole blood samples through differential centrifugation and Ficoll-Paque). A Spearman’s rank order correlation coefficient was used for associations between variables and a regression analysis was performed to determine which measurement accounted for the inflammation in this young and apparently healthy population. RESULTS: While the inflammatory markers were not associated with each other, CRP levels were associated with body composition and following regression analyses, body fat percentage (P>0.05) was a significant factor for elevated CRP. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic physical exercise eliciting lower body fat percentages in young adults may have a positive protective impact through anti-inflammatory status, minimizing disease risk in a young population. RELEVANCE FOR PATIENTS: Chronic physically active young adult patients may exhibit less inflammation and lower body fat levels which may decrease their risk for chronic disease.","Dunn, Sarah L.; Vera, Desiree L.; Weaver, Kathleen F.; Garcia, Jerome V.",J Clin Transl Res,89,26

We thus hypothesized family physicians between the two places would be different in how they protected themselves, their staff and families during the epidemic. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to explore and contrast the impact of SARS on family physicians in Hong Kong and Toronto. METHODS A postal questionnaire was designed and sent to 183 tutors affiliated with the Chinese University of Hong Kong with 137 replies (74.8%). In Toronto, 150 questionnaires were sent to academic family physicians affiliated with the University of Toronto with 51 replies (34%). RESULTS All agreed SARS had changed their clinical behaviour. For public health measures in the control of SARS, Hong Kong physicians were less likely to quarantined themselves (77.1% versus 19.4%, P < 0.01) or gave quarantine leave to staff (95% versus 59.7%, P < 0.01) after exposure to probable or suspected SARS. However, they were more likely to wear a mask (52.7% versus 97.7%, P = 0) during consultation, having support staff to wear masks (68.6% versus 97.8%, P = 0) and test patient's temperature (47.1% versus 68.1%, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION There were noticeable differences in how family physicians deal with SARS between the two cities. As SARS emerged as a global disease, better understanding of practice differences among physicians from different countries would facilitate globalization of public health.","Wong, Samuel Yeung Shan; Wong, William; Jaakkimainen, Liisa; Bondy, Susan; Tsang, Kwong Ka; Lee, Albert",Family practice,89,16

To know the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the city of Madrid and its 21 districts in the first 4 months of the epidemic and its relationship with some socioeconomic and demographic variables. METHODS Cross-sectional ecological study (39,270 cases). The 39,270 cases diagnosed from the beginning of the pandemic until June 26, 2020, published by the Comunidad de Madrid in were studied. In the districts, the distribution of gross and fair incidence is related to the ones of the independent variables (Municipal Statistics and Estudio de Salud 2018, Madrid Salud). The Incidence and the r and r2 coefficients, obtained with the factors and the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model, are studied. RESULTS The city of Madrid presents a cumulative incidence of COVID-19, which is double the national one (100), with a Standardized Cumulative Incidence Ratio (RIAE) of 204.59 per 100. The districts with the most RIAE were those in the southeast, all>240 per 100. In the districts, the per capita household rate, the per capita income, and the mortality rate from infectious diseases in men reached high and inverse correlations with RIAE (all r>-0.3). The RLM model with these 3 indicators predicts 30% of the RIAES. CONCLUSIONS The relationship between material wealth and the risk of COVID-19 infection is inverse. The knowledge in the districts of per capita income, household rate and mortality rate due to infectious diseases in men reduces the uncertainty about the accumulated incidence by 30%.","Díaz-Olalla, José Manuel; Blasco-Novalbos, Gema; Valero-Otero, Irene",Revista espanola de salud publica,89,16

CKD patients should be treated according to local or national COVID-19 protocols as other patients. But, there is no data on using remdesivir in patients with severe CKD. Oseltamivir and ribavirin require dose modification in patients with moderate to severe CKD. Nephrolithiasis, CKD, and acute interstitial nephritis have been reported with protease inhibitors. Acute kidney injury has been reported with remdesivir in patients with severe COVID-19. Pharmacokinetic-enhanced protease inhibitors increase the concentration of some drugs such as statins, cinacalcet, steroids, calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs). Some hypothetical benefits and harms have been suggested for statins and renin-angiotensinaldosterone system inhibitors in COVID-19 patients. Continuing guideline-directed administration of these drugs is recommended. Among different immunomodulating/immunosuppressive drugs, hydroxychloroquine and CNIs are the safest ones during COVID-19. Antimetabolites are suggested to be withheld during moderate to severe COVID-19. Fluid therapy and anticoagulant prophylaxis/ treatment need special attention in CKD patients with COVID-19.

To identify the receptor-binding domain of the viral spike glycoprotein (S), we expressed soluble truncated histidine-tagged S glycoproteins by using baculovirus expression vectors. Truncated S proteins purified by nickel affinity chromatography were shown to be glycosylated and to react with polyclonal anti-HCoV-229E antibodies and monoclonal antibodies to the viral S protein. A truncated protein (S(547)) that contains the N-terminal 547 amino acids bound to 3T3 mouse cells that express hAPN but not to mouse 3T3 cells transfected with empty vector. Binding of S(547) to hAPN was blocked by an anti-hAPN monoclonal antibody that inhibits binding of virus to hAPN and blocks virus infection of human cells and was also blocked by polyclonal anti-HCoV-229E antibody. S proteins that contain the N-terminal 268 or 417 amino acids did not bind to hAPN-3T3 cells. Antibody to the region from amino acid 417 to the C terminus of S blocked binding of S(547) to hAPN-3T3 cells. Thus, the data suggest that the domain of the spike protein between amino acids 417 and 547 is required for the binding of HCoV-229E to its hAPN receptor.","Bonavia, Aurelio; Zelus, Bruce D; Wentworth, David E; Talbot, Pierre J; Holmes, Kathryn V",Journal of virology,89,28

The coding sequence of gene 1 is 20,273 nucleotides in length. Within this coding region are two large open reading frames, ORF 1a (4,086 codons) and ORF 1b (2,687 codons) which overlap by 40 nucleotides. In the overlapping region, the genomic RNA can be folded into a pseudoknot structure, an element which is known to mediate -1 ribosomal frame-shifting in other coronaviruses. Assuming that -1 frame-shifting occurs at the HCV sequence UUUAAAC (nucleotides 12,514-12,520), the ORF 1a - ORF 1b product is predicted to be 6,758 amino acids in length. Our sequence analysis of the HCV 229E gene 1 has revealed a high degree of similarity within the ORF 1b of HCV, MHV and IBV, whereas ORF 1a is much less conserved.

Safe triage and follow up systems are required to manage this unprecedented demand. METHODS We designed a pathway for the triage and assessment of patients based on their resting oxygen saturations and response to a 30 metre rapid walking test. We admitted patients to a 'Virtual Ward' for remote oximetry monitoring from the Emergency Department, step down from inpatient wards and from the local Primary Care 'Hot Hub'. This allowed the safe and managed readmission of those patients who deteriorated at home. RESULTS During the first wave of COVID-19 we entered 273 onto the pathway for Virtual Ward follow up. Of these, 31 patients were readmitted to hospital, two were admitted to Intensive Care and one patient died. Median oxygen saturation at presentation was 97 % (IQR 96-98%) and following a 30 metre walk test 96% (IQR 94-97%). Median NEWS-2 score was 2 (IQR 1-3). On feedback 99.5% of patients were likely or extremely likely to recommend the service to their family and friends. There was a cost avoidance of £107,600 per month. CONCLUSION It is safe, feasible and cost effective to set up a triage system with remote oximetry monitoring for patients with COVID-19 and overwhelmingly patients find it a positive experience.","Nunan, J; Clarke, D; Malakouti, A; Tannetta, D; Calthrop, A; Xu, X H; Chan, N B; Khalil, R; Li, W; Walden, A",Acute medicine,89,26

The aim of this study was to compare the incidence rate and surgical management of these complications in LVR patients with polyester (PE) or polypropylene (PP) prostheses. METHODS From January 2004 to June 2012, 149 patients underwent LVR with PE and 176 underwent LVR with PP. Surgical management and rate of infectious and erosive prosthesis-related complications, depending on the type of prosthesis, were described and compared. Functional results after complications were assessed. RESULTS Five patients from the PE prosthesis group (3.3 %), compared with two patients from the PP prosthesis group (1.1 %), experienced prosthesis-related infection or erosion (p = 0.16). The rate of erosion alone was 3.3 % in patients with a PE prosthesis, and 0.55 % in patients with a PP prosthesis (p = 0.06). The average time until clinical diagnosis of a prosthesis-related complication was identical for both groups: 31 months (range 3-62 months). All patients underwent surgical removal of the prosthesis: For the five patients from the PE group, complete removal was performed by laparoscopy associated with a transanal procedure. For the two patients in the PP mesh group, laparoscopy was ineffective in removing the mesh which was partially removed through a subsequent transanal procedure. None of the patients had a protective stoma, and in all patients the complication had resolved 12 months after removal. Only one patient had worsening functional symptoms (fecal incontinence) after prosthesis removal. CONCLUSIONS When a prosthesis-related infection or erosion occurs, treatment consists in the surgical removal of the prosthesis by laparoscopy/and/or a transanal procedure. Functional symptoms do not routinely recur after prosthesis removal.","Borie, F; Coste, T; Bigourdan, J M; Guillon, F",Techniques in coloproctology,89,1

Three scenarios were compared: ""no gown,"" ""standard gown"" and ""modified gown."" Key time intervals were extracted from videotaped data. RESULTS Ninety-five scenarios were analyzed. Mean time interval to chest compression was 39 seconds (95% confidence interval [CI] 34-43) for ""no gown"" scenarios, 71 seconds (95% CI 66-77) for ""standard gown"" scenarios and 59 seconds (95% CI 54-63) for ""modified gown"" scenarios (p < 0.001). Time to first ventilation was 146 seconds (95% CI 134-158), 238 seconds (95% CI 224-253) and 210 seconds (95% CI 198-223) in the 3 groups, respectively (p < 0.001). Post hoc testing showed that the time differences between all groups were statistically significant. CONCLUSION Standard gowns protect front-line care providers but cause significant delays to chest compressions and ventilations, potentially increasing patient morbidity and mortality. Minor gown modifications, including pre-tied neck straps and longer waist ties that tie in front, allow for easier use and shorter delays to time-critical interventions. Future research is required to reduce care delays while maintaining adequate protection of emergency medical service providers from infectious disease.","Watson, Leah; Sault, William; Gwyn, Randy; Verbeek, P Richard",CJEM,89,19

METHODS Samples of peripheral blood were collected twice during the first 2 weeks after discharge and then once every 2 - 4 weeks from 310 convalescents of SARS, 131 males and 179 females, aged 18 - 74, discharged from hospitals in Beijing April 3 to June 20 2003 with the average discharge date of June 10, to detect the level of immunoglobulin G (IgG) by ELISA. A curve of level of IgG was drawn to describe the change by the specific month in the year. RESULTS Most of the 310 convalescents underwent successive or non-successive testing for 2 - 4 months and 15 were tested for 5 months, 15 for 6 months, and 2 for 7 months. IgG was detected in each sample with the mean of A value of 0.97 +/- 0.37 (0.197 - 1.849). The mean IgG level peaked in July (1.203), about 35 days after discharge, and then gradually declined to 0.857 in December, a decline by 27.3%. CONCLUSION All SARS patients generate specific antibody against the coronavirus. However, the antibody level gradually decline with the lapse of time during the convalescence. Long-term surveillance of the change of antibody is necessary.","Fan, Bao-Xing; Liu, You-Ning; Xie, Li-Xin; Tian, Qing; Chen, Liang-An; Chen, Wei-Jun; Wen, Jie",Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,89,1

The recent introduction of knotless barbed sutures may address the shortcomings of conventional sutures and offer the additional benefit of reduced operating time. In this paper, we describe our experience with barbed sutures for body-contouring procedures. We share technical insights and evaluate postoperative complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS A retrospective assessment of prospectively collected data over a period of more than 5 years was undertaken. Six hundred twenty-three consecutive patients underwent 695 body-contouring procedures with barbed suture closure. Patients were followed for at least 12 weeks postoperatively. Patient demographics, operation time as well as suture-related complications, such as wound dehiscence and wound site infection were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS Barbed sutures can facilitate skin closure, rectus plication, quilting, and deep layer closure in body-contouring procedures. The average operating time in our study cohort was 108 min with reduction mammoplasty being the quickest (94 min) and bodylift (156 min) being the slowest procedure. Sixty-eight patients experienced suture-related complications resulting in an overall complication rate of 9.7 % with thigh lift having the most (15 %) and reduction mammoplasty (7 %) the fewest adverse events. CONCLUSION The use of barbed sutures allows quick closure of lengthy body-contouring incision lines with low complication rates. Our observations support that barbed sutures are safe, convenient and effective. In our hands barbed sutures appear to be superior to traditional wound-closure techniques in body-contouring procedures.

A small gastric pouch is created, leaving a narrow gastrojejunal anastomosis, with a long jejunal limb. Very little is known regarding the behavior of this pouch years after surgery. AIM To determine through prospective sequential endoscopic studies the size of the gastric pouch, the diameter of the anastomosis, and the behavior of H. pylori infection after surgery. METHODS In 130 patients subjected to resectional gastric bypass, several routine sequential endoscopic (until 120 months) and histological evaluations of the gastric pouch were performed. RESULTS After surgery, a mean of 3.6 endoscopies/patient were performed. Macroscopically nearly 95% of the small gastric pouches were normal, and the main pathological finding was a marginal ulcer. Erosive esophagitis disappeared in 93% of the patients. There was no increase in the orocaudal size of the pouch during this period of observation. There was no dilatation of the diameter of gastrojejunal anastomosis. Near 54% of all patients had normal fundic mucosa, while 18% had chronic active gastritis, coincident with H. pylori infection. Five patients had intestinal metaplasia. CONCLUSION Based on this sequential endoscopic evaluation, there was no increase in the orocaudal size of the gastric pouch nor increase in the diameter of the gastrojejunal anastomosis. H. pylori behavior was inconsistent and difficult to interpret.","Csendes, Attila; Smok, Gladys; Burgos, Ana Maria; Canobra, Moira",Arquivos brasileiros de cirurgia digestiva : ABCD = Brazilian archives of digestive surgery,89,1

Increasing cigarette excise taxes is one of the most effective tobacco control policies because it directly increases cigarette prices, thereby reducing cigarette use and smoking-related death and disease. All states and the District of Columbia (DC) impose an excise tax on cigarettes. Because many states increased their cigarette excise taxes in 2009, CDC conducted a survey of these tax increases. For this report, CDC reviewed data contained in a legislative database to identify cigarette excise tax legislation that was enacted during 2009 by the 50 states and DC. During that period, 15 states (including DC), increased their state excise tax on cigarettes, increasing the national mean from $1.18 per pack in 2008 to $1.34 per pack in 2009. However, none of the 15 states dedicated any of the new excise tax revenue by statute to tobacco control. Additionally, for the first time, two states (Connecticut and Rhode Island) had excise tax rates of at least $3.00 per pack. Additional increases in cigarette excise taxes, and dedication of all resulting revenues to tobacco control and prevention programs at levels recommended by CDC, could result in further reductions in smoking and associated morbidity and mortality.",,MMWR.

The present study aimed to address this issue through the determination of the influences of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of myxovirus resistence-1 (MxA) -88 G/T and interferon (IFN)-gamma +874 A/T on the natural history of HBV infection in endemic regions. One hundred adult patients with self-limiting HBV infection (positive for both anti-HBs and anti-HBc) and 340 adult patients with persistent HBV infection were recruited from southern China, an endemic area with an HBsAg carrier rate of 17.8%. SNPs of MxA -88 G/T and interferon (IFN)-gamma +874 A/T were typed using a protocol based on competitively differentiated polymerase chain reaction. A highly significant difference in the distribution of MxA -88 G/T was observed between those with persistent and self-limiting HBV infections. The latter displayed a lower frequency of the GG genotype (41.0% vs. 52.9%, P = 0.036) and a higher frequency of the TT genotype (16.0% vs. 2.4%, P = 0.000), compared to patients with persistent infection. These differences were not gender- or age-specific. However, a significant distribution difference of IFN-gamma +874 A/T was not observed. Between two groups of patients, respectively, the distribution frequencies of the AA genotype (65.0% vs. 72.8%, P = 0.139) and the TT genotype (2.0% vs. 1.2%, P = 0.894) were found. These results suggest that MxA gene -88 G/T and IFN-gamma +874 A/T behave differently in endemic HBV infections.

Their 5' common leader sequence is derived from the genomic 5'-proximal region. Fusion of sg RNA leader and ""body"" segments involves a discontinuous transcription step. Presumably during minus-strand synthesis, the nascent RNA strand is transferred from one site in the genomic template to another, a process guided by conserved transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) at these template sites. Subgenomic RNA species are produced in different but constant molar ratios, with the smallest RNAs usually being most abundant. Factors thought to influence sg RNA synthesis are size differences between sg RNA species, differences in sequence context between body TRSs, and the mutual influence (or competition) between strand transfer reactions occurring at different body TRSs. Using an Equine arteritis virus infectious cDNA clone, we investigated how body TRS activity affected sg RNA synthesis from neighboring body TRSs. Flanking sequences were standardized by head-to-tail insertion of several copies of an RNA7 body TRS cassette. A perfect gradient of sg RNA abundance, progressively favoring smaller RNA species, was observed. Disruption of body TRS function by mutagenesis did not have a significant effect on the activity of other TRSs. However, deletion of body TRS-containing regions enhanced synthesis of sg RNAs from upstream TRSs but not of those produced from downstream TRSs. The results of this study provide considerable support for the proposed discontinuous extension of minus-strand RNA synthesis as a crucial step in sg RNA synthesis.","Pasternak, Alexander O; Spaan, Willy J M; Snijder, Eric J",Journal of virology,89,19

The association between lung injury and thrombocytopenia was further investigated in vitro in rats with lung injury. MK and platelet counts, and platelet activation between the prepulmonary (right atrial) and postpulmonary (left atrial) blood were also compared. In human, the total number of MK in central venous was higher than those of peripheral arteries during normal circulation. During CPB, the total MK and Type-4 MK of central venous and peripheral arteries were significant increased when compared with that in normal circulation. In healthy rats, the postpulmonary blood had lower MK count, higher platelet count, and similar P-selectin expression. However, the lung-damaged animals showed no such differences in either MK or platelet count, but P-selectin expression was greater in the postpulmonary blood. Peripheral platelets in the lung-injured rats were significantly lower than those in their respective controls.

Determining an appropriate level of response requires rapid estimation of the rate of spread of infection from limited disease distribution data. Generally, the techniques used to estimate such spatial parameters require detailed spatial data at multiple time points; such data are often time-consuming and expensive to collect. Here we present an alternative approach that is computationally efficient and only requires spatial data from a single time point, hence saving valuable time at the start of the epidemic. By assuming that fundamental spatial statistics are near equilibrium, parameters can be estimated by minimizing the expected rate of change of these statistics, hence conserving the general spatial pattern. Although applicable to both ecological and epidemiological data, here we focus on disease data from computer simulations and real epidemics to show that this method produces reliable results that could be used in practical situations.","Keeling, Matt J; Brooks, Stephen P; Gilligan, Christopher A",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,89,7

Purpose To determine the value of chest radiographic findings together with patient history and laboratory markers at admission to predict critical illness in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Material and Methods In this retrospective study including patients from 7th March 2020 to 24th April 2020, a consecutive cohort of hospitalized patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 from two large Dutch community hospitals was identified. After univariable analysis, a risk model to predict critical illness (i.e. death and/or ICU admission with invasive ventilation) was developed, using multivariable logistic regression including clinical, CXR and laboratory findings. Distribution and severity of lung involvement was visually assessed using an 8-point scale (chest radiography score). Internal validation was performed using bootstrapping. Performance is presented as an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Decision curve analysis was performed, and a risk calculator was derived. Results The cohort included 356 hospitalized patients (69 ±12 years, 237 male) of whom 168 (47%) developed critical illness. The final risk model's variables included gender, chronic obstructive lung disease, symptom duration, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein level, lactate dehydrogenase level, distribution of lung disease and chest radiography score at hospital presentation. The AUC of the model was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.72-0.81, P < .001). A risk calculator was derived for individual risk assessment; Dutch COVID-19 risk model (see Appendix E2). At an example threshold of 0.70, 71 of 356 patients would be predicted to develop critical illness of which 59 (83%) would be true-positives.

211414,211414,211414,A dynamic simulation study of FDA drug from zinc database against COVID-19 main protease receptor,9.733388,8.236711,2020,"IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of SARS-CoV-2 to inform public health policy. By enabling definition of lineages it facilitates tracking of the global spread of the virus. The evolution of new variants can be monitored and knowledge of specific mutations provides insights into the mechanisms through which the virus increases transmissibility or evades immunity. To date almost one million SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been sequenced by members of the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium. To achieve similar feats in a more cost-effective and sustainable manner in future, improved high throughput virus sequencing protocols are required. We have therefore developed a miniaturized library preparation protocol with drastically reduced consumable use and costs. MethodsSARS-CoV-2 RNA was amplified using the ARTIC nCov-2019 multiplex RT-PCR protocol and purified using a conventional liquid handling system. Acoustic liquid transfer (Echo 525) was employed to reduce reaction volumes and the number of tips required for a Nextera XT library preparation. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq. ResultsWe present the Mini-XT miniaturized tagmentation-based library preparation protocol available on protocols.io (https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bvntn5en). The final version of Mini-XT has been used to sequence 4,384 SARS-CoV-2 samples from N. Ireland with a COG-UK QC pass rate of 97.4%. Sequencing quality was comparable and lineage calling consistent for replicate samples processed with full volume Nextera DNA Flex (333 samples) or using nanopore technology (20 samples). SNP calling between Mini-XT and these technologies was consistent and sequences from replicate samples paired together in maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees. ConclusionThe Mini-XT protocol maintains sequence quality while reducing library preparation reagent volumes 8-fold and halving overall tip usage from sample to sequence to provide concomitant cost savings relative to standard protocols.

In this study, the effects of a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 was investigated in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Stimulation of PBMCs with spike glycoprotein S1 (100 ng/mL) resulted in significant elevation in the production of TNF&#945;, IL-6, IL-1ß and IL-8. However, pre-treatment with dexamethasone (100 nM) caused significant reduction in the release of these cytokines. Further experiments revealed that S1 stimulation of PBMCs increased phosphorylation of NF-&#954;B p65 and I&#954;B&#945;, and I&#954;B&#945; degradation. DNA binding of NF-&#954;B p65 was also significantly increased following stimulation with spike glycoprotein S1. Treatment of PBMCs with dexamethasone (100 nM) or BAY11-7082 (1 µM) resulted in inhibition of spike glycoprotein S1-induced NF-&#954;B activation. Activation of p38 MAPK by S1 was blocked in the presence of dexamethasone and SKF 86002. CRID3, but not dexamethasone pre-treatment, produced significant inhibition of S1-induced activation of NLRP3/caspase-1. Further experiments revealed that S1-induced increase in the production of TNF&#945;, IL-6, IL-1ß and IL-8 was reduced in the presence of BAY11-7082 and SKF 86002, while CRID3 pre-treatment resulted in the reduction of IL-1ß production. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 stimulated PBMCs to release pro-inflammatory cytokines through mechanisms involving activation of NF-&#954;B, p38 MAPK and NLRP3 inflammasome. It is proposed that the clinical benefits of dexamethasone in COVID-19 are possibly due to its anti-inflammatory activity in reducing SARS-CoV-2 cytokine storm.","Olajide, Olumayokun A; Iwuanyanwu, Victoria U; Lepiarz-Raba, Izabela; Al-Hindawi, Alaa A",Inflammation,89,16

METHOD: The study applied the taxonomic triangulation technique on a clinical management guide to coronavirus disease, COVID-19, from the World Health Organization. The technique is divided into the phases: extraction of knowledge in natural language about assessment, planning and intervention, translation into standard language NOC and NIC, linking to NANDA-I diagnoses, triangulation looking for diagnostic matches in the three sets, and, finally, validation by a panel of experts from a hospital and a university. FINDINGS: The extraction identified 159 terms in natural language that were translated into 173 variables: 34 NOC for assessment, 19 NOC for planning, and 120 NIC for intervention. The relationships to NANDA-I diagnoses recorded 2,182 links and the triangulation returned 109 diagnoses, 54 of them for a critical situation. The panel of experts unanimously validated the 29 diagnoses with the highest number of links. CONCLUSION: Coronavirus disease, COVID-19, involves a complex situation with multiple associated care problems that can be identified using the taxonomic triangulation technique. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The links between taxonomies and the taxonomic triangulation technique are an important tool for generating knowledge. The results of this study may guide the diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus disease, COVID-19, as well as similar processes that occur with acute respiratory distress syndrome.","González-Aguña, Alexandra; Jiménez-Rodríguez, María Lourdes; Fernández-Batalla, Marta; Herrero-Jaén, Sara; Monsalvo-San Macario, Enrique; Real-Martínez, Verónica; Santamaría-García, José María",International journal of nursing knowledge (Online),89,16

A total of 1,421 healthcare professionals who were in contact with at least one positive COVID-19 patient participated in a cross-sectional online survey from April to June 2020. Mental health was measured with the General Health Questionnaire-12, and loneliness was assessed with the 3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale. More than 80% of participants showed a certain prone to experience mental health problems, and 90% felt that they had not enough workplace protective measures to manage COVID-19 patients. Presence of loneliness was positively related to higher mental health problems after controlling for other covariates. Other factors related to higher mental health problems were a higher COVID-19 risk perception, being in quarantine, checking COVID-19-related news several times a day and having a lower training on managing infectious diseases. Neither living alone, nor supervisor social support, were related to healthcare professionals' mental health. Results suggest that the impact of COVID-19 in terms of mental health in the healthcare professionals could be more related to subjective appraisals of social isolation rather than to be physically alone. There were also a variety of cognitive, behavioural and training-related factors that were associated with the healthcare professionals' mental health, and that should be potentially managed in the mental healthcare interventions.","Cabello, María; Izquierdo, Ana; Leal, Itziar",Heal. soc. care community,89,20

Design and methods: In this exploratory study, we prospectively included adult patients (aged &#8805; 18 years) admitted between February 26 and April 30, 2020 to a tertiary care hospital in Switzerland. We assessed the association of an underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection and equilibrium serum levels of RAAS peptides in hospitalized COVID-19 patients 1:1 propensity-score matched with patients suffering from SARS-CoV-2-negative respiratory infections. Subgroup analyses involved stratification for taking RAAS inhibitors. Results: COVID-19 patients had about 50% lower equilibrium serum RAAS peptide levels as compared with matched controls (angiotensin I: 31.6 vs 66.8 pmol/L, -52.7% (95%CI: -68.5% to -36.9%); angiotensin II: 37.7 vs 92.5 pmol/L, -59.2% (95%CI: -72.1% to -46.3%); angiotensin (1-5): 3.3 vs 6.6 pmol/L, -49.7% (95%CI: -59.2% to -40.2%); angiotensin (1-7): 4.8 vs 7.6 pmol/L, -64.9% (95%CI: -84.5% to -45.3%)). While the plasma renin activity was lower in COVID-19 patients (88.6 vs 207.9 pmol/L, -58.5% (95%CI: -71.4% to -45.6%)), there was no difference of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 plasma activity between the groups. Subgroup analyses revealed a pronounced RAAS peptide profile depression in COVID-19 patients among those not on RAAS inhibitors. Conclusions: As compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative patients, we found a downregulated RAAS in presence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whether the lower levels of the protective angiotensin (1-5) and (1-7) are linked to adverse outcomes in COVID-19 warrants further investigation.","Kutz, Alexander; Conen, Anna; Gregoriano, Claudia; Haubitz, Sebastian; Koch, Daniel; Domenig, Oliver; Bernasconi, Luca; Mueller, Beat; Schuetz, Philipp",Eur J Endocrinol,89,24

Using unsupervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) semantic topic discovery, we identify temporal patterns in the use of credit cards that allow us to quantitatively assess the changes in the behavior of the people under the lockdown measures because of the COVID-19 pandemic. An unsupervised latent topic analysis uncovers the main patterns of credit card transaction activity that explain the behavior of the inhabitants of Santiago City. The approach is non-intrusive because it does not require the collaboration of people for providing the anonymous data. It does not interfere with the actual behavior of the people in the city; hence, it does not introduce any bias. We identify a strong downturn of the economic activity as measured by credit card transactions (down to 70%), and thus of the economic activity, in city sections (communes) that were subjected to lockdown versus communes without lockdown. This change in behavior is confirmed by independent data from mobile phone connectivity. The reduction of activity emerges before the actual lockdowns were enforced, suggesting that the population was spontaneously implementing the required measures for slowing virus propagation.","Muñoz-Cancino, Ricardo; Rios, Sebastian A; Goic, Marcel; Graña, Manuel",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),89,16

It has inflicted severe public health and economic hardships across the world. In addition to acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, sepsis, and acute kidney injury, COVID-19 also causes heart failure (HF). COVID-19-induced HF is manifested via different mechanisms, including, but not limited to, (1) virus-induced infiltration of inflammatory cells, which could impair the function of the heart; (2) pro-inflammatory cytokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin-1ß; interleukin-6; tumor necrosis factor-&#945;) that could cause necrosis and death of the myocardium; (3) endothelial injury coupled with micro-thrombosis which could damage the endocardium; and (4) acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure that could lead to heart failure due to severe hypoxia. It is concluded that the etiology of COVID-19-induced HF is multifactorial and mitigation of the development of HF in patients with COVID-19 will require different approaches such as social distancing, drug therapy, and the urgent development of a vaccine to eradicate the disease.","Adeghate, Ernest A; Eid, Nabil; Singh, Jaipaul",Heart fail. rev,89,29

METHODS: We constructed a forecast model of the epidemiological scenario via the classic susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) approach. The World Health Organization's COVID-19 Essential Supplies Forecasting Tool was used to evaluate the healthcare resources needed for the next 12 weeks. RESULTS: Over the forecast period, there will be 104 713.7 hospital admissions due to severe disease and 34 904.5 hospital admissions due to critical disease. This will require 47 247.7 beds for severe disease and 1929.9 beds for critical disease at the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Metabolic disease development was determined in Asbt-/- mice receiving a low fat control diet or high fat diet (HFD) rich in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) or PUFAs. RESULTS: Both ASBT inhibition and Asbt gene inactivation reduced total fat absorption, particularly of SFAs. Asbt gene inactivation lowered bodyweight gain, improved insulin sensitivity and decreased the NAFLD activity score upon feeding a HFD rich in SFAs but not in PUFAs. CONCLUSIONS: The beneficial metabolic effects of ASBT inactivation on diet-induced obesity depend on decreased intestinal absorption of SFAs, and thus on the dietary fatty acid composition. These findings highlight the importance of dietary fatty acid composition in the therapeutic effects of ASBT inhibition. This article is protected by copyright.

Infectious disease outbreaks such as COVID-19 can also significantly affect the sustainable development of urban areas. Several factors such as population density and climatology parameters could potentially affect the spread of the COVID-19. In this study, a combination of the virus optimization algorithm (VOA) and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was used to investigate the effects of various climate-related factors and population density on the spread of the COVID-19. For this purpose, data on the climate-related factors and the confirmed infected cases by the COVID-19 across the U.S counties was used. The results show that the variable defined for the population density had the most significant impact on the performance of the developed models, which is an indication of the importance of social distancing in reducing the infection rate and spread rate of the COVID-19. Among the climatology parameters, an increase in the maximum temperature was found to slightly reduce the infection rate. Average temperature, minimum temperature, precipitation, and average wind speed were not found to significantly affect the spread of the COVID-19 while an increase in the relative humidity was found to slightly increase the infection rate. The findings of this research show that it could be expected to have slightly reduced infection rate over the summer season. However, it should be noted that the models developed in this study were based on limited one-month data. Future investigation can benefit from using more comprehensive data covering a wider range for the input variables.","Behnood, Ali; Mohammadi Golafshani, Emadaldin; Hosseini, Seyedeh Mohaddeseh",Chaos Solitons Fractals,89,3

Several strategies have been explored to develop vaccines against these viral diseases. The main effort in the journey of development of vaccines is to neutralize the fusion protein using antibodies. However, significant efforts have been made in discovering peptides and small molecules that inhibit the fusion between virus and host cell, thereby inhibiting the entry of viruses. This class of inhibitors is called entry inhibitors, and they are extremely efficient in reducing viral infection as the entry of the virus is considered as the first step of infection. Nevertheless, these inhibitors are highly selective for a particular virus as antibody-based vaccines. The recent COVID-19 pandemic lets us ponder to shift our attention towards broad-spectrum antiviral agents from the so-called 'one bug-one drug' approach. This review discusses peptide and small molecule-based entry inhibitors against class I, II, and III viruses and sheds light on broad-spectrum antiviral agents.","Pattnaik, Gourab Prasad; Chakraborty, Hirak",J Membr Biol,89,6

However, a rise in COPD hospitalisations may indicate a considerable increase in fatality rate in public health. The current study focuses on the association between consecutive ambient air pollution (CAAP) and COPD hospitalisation to offer predictable early guidance towards estimates of COPD hospital admissions in the event of consecutive exposure to air pollution. Big data analytics were collected from 3-year time series recordings (from 2015 to 2017) of both air data and COPD hospitalisation data in the Chengdu region in China. Based on the combined effects of CAAP and unit increase in air pollutant concentrations, a quasi-Poisson regression model was established, which revealed the association between CAAP and estimated COPD admissions. The results show the dynamics and outbreaks in the variations in COPD admissions in response to CAAP. Cross-validation and mean squared error (MSE) are applied to validate the goodness of fit. In both short-term and long-term air pollution exposures, Z test outcomes show that the COPD hospitalisation risk is greater for men than for women; similarly, the occurrence of COPD hospital admissions in the group of elderly people (> 65 years old) is significantly larger than that in lower age groups. The time lag between the air quality and COPD hospitalisation is also investigated, and a peak of COPD hospitalisation risk is found to lag 2 days for air quality index (AQI) and PM10, and 1 day for PM2.5. The big data-based predictive paradigm would be a measure for the early detection of a public health event in post-COVID-19. The study findings can also provide guidance for COPD admissions in the event of consecutive exposure to air pollution in the Chengdu region.","Zhang, Yi; Wang, Ziyue; Cao, Yu; Zhang, Lifu; Wang, Guan; Dong, Fangjie; Deng, Ren; Guo, Baogen; Zeng, Li; Wang, Peng; Dai, Ruimei; Ran, Yu; Lyu, Wenyi; Miao, Peiwen; Su, Steven",Air Qual Atmos Health,89,14

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty Sprague Dawley rats were divided into 5 groups. Two groups served as control and received orally either vehicle or TPPU (3 mg/kg) for five weeks. The other three groups were given L-NAME (50 mg/kg/day) in drinking water for five weeks. Two weeks after the L-NAME treatment, animals received orally either saline or TPPU (3 mg/kg/day) or lisinopril (10 mg/kg/day) daily for 3 weeks. Blood pressure (BP) was measured weekly. At the end of the experiment, plasma Ang II, cardiac ACE and AT1R protein and gene expressions were determined. RESULTS: L-NAME caused a significant increase in BP of the animals. TPPU and lisinopril resulted in normalization of L-NAME-induced hypertension. They also caused a significant reduction in Ang II and ACE protein and gene expressions compared to L-NAME and vehicle-treated animals. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that TPPU effectively lowers L-NAME-induced hypertension in rats. The mechanism of its antihypertensive effect is likely mediated by the suppression of ACE gene and protein expression, leading to a lower Ang II level.","Bukhari, I A; Alorainey, B I; Al-Motrefi, A A; Mahmoud, A; Campbell, W B; Hammock, B D",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,89,26

The aim was to analyse the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak on reperfusion therapies for acute ischaemic stroke in the northwest of Spain. METHODS: This was a Spanish multicentre retrospective observational study based on data from tertiary hospitals of the NORDICTUS network. All patients receiving reperfusion therapy for ischaemic stroke between 30 December 2019 and 3 May 2020 were recorded, and their baseline, clinical and radiological characteristics, extra- and intra-hospital times of action, Code Stroke activation pathway, COVID-19 status, reperfusion rate, and short-term outcome before and after the setting of the emergency state were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 796 patients received reperfusion therapies for ischaemic stroke. There was a decrease in the number of patients treated per week (46.5 patients per week vs. 39.0 patients per week, P = 0.043) and a delay in out-of-hospital (95.0 vs. 110.0 min, P = 0.001) and door-to-needle times (51.0 vs. 55.0, P = 0.038). Patients receiving endovascular therapy obtained less successful reperfusion rates (92.9% vs. 86.6%, P = 0.016). COVID-19 patients had more in-hospital mortality.

Ophthalmologists are at daily personal risk of acquiring and transmitting the virus. Implementation of official practical and protective guidelines can be challenging and is often absent. The purpose of this study was to describe the status of ophthalmology practice in Israel, at the early stages of the outbreak. METHODS: A 17-item questionnaire was distributed to ophthalmologists practicing in Israel. Data was obtained regarding demographics and clinical and surgical practice during the pandemic. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-seven ophthalmologists completed the survey from all regions of Israel. The survey was distributed during the early stages of the outbreak. At this time, no official government guidelines were in place. Most respondents reported no reduction of elective clinic visits and surgeries and no utilization of triage questionnaires. COVID-19 guidelines were reportedly promulgated to hospital ophthalmologists but not to community and private physicians. Personal protective equipment (PPE) measures were reportedly utilized; however, many respondents often acquired them individually. A majority of respondents advocated that healthcare institutions limit clinic and surgery services to emergency services.

However, data for frontline HCWs level of exposure and risk of COVID-19 virus infection are limited. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the level of exposure and risk of COVID-19 virus infection among HCWs in COVID-19 treatment centers in Ghana. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was utilized in this study and HCWs were invited by convenience to participate in the study, 408 HCWs in 4 COVID-19 treatment centers participated in the study. Adherence to infection prevention and control (IPC) measures were used to categorized HCWs as low or high risk of COVID-19 virus infection. The WHO COVID-19 risk assessment tool was used to collect quantitative data from the study participants. RESULTS: There was a high (N = 328, 80.4%) level of occupational exposure to the COVID-19 virus. However, only 14.0% of the exposed HCWs were at high risk of COVID-19 virus infection. Healthcare workers who performed or were present during any aerosol-generating procedures (AGP) were 23.8 times more likely to be exposed compared to HCWs who did not perform or were absent during any AGP (AOR 23.83; 95% CI: 18.45, 39.20). High risk of COVID-19 virus infection was less likely among registered nurses (AOR = 0.09; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.60), HCWs who performed or were present during any AGP (AOR = 0.05; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.50) and HCWs with a master's degree qualification (AOR 0.06; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.63). CONCLUSION: Despite the high level of exposure to the COVID-19 virus among HCWs in the treatment centers, only 14.0% were at high risk of COVID-19 virus infection.

The primary endpoint of this study is to compare the mortality rate at 1 month after surgery in symptomatic COVID-positive patients with that of asymptomatic patients. A secondary endpoint of the study is to evaluate, in the two groups of patients, mortality at 1 month on the basis of type of fracture and type of surgical treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this retrospective multicentre study, we reviewed the medical records of patients hospitalised for proximal femur fracture at 14 hospitals in Northern Italy. Two groups were formed: COVID-19-positive patients (C+ group) presented symptoms, had a positive swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and received treatment for COVID-19; COVID-19-negative patients (C- group) were asymptomatic and tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. The two groups were compared for differences in time to surgery, survival rate and complications rate. The follow-up period was 1 month. RESULTS: Of the 1390 patients admitted for acute care for any reason, 477 had a proximal femur fracture; 53 were C+ but only 12/53 were diagnosed as such at admission.

At the beginning of the article, he makes it clear with a few historical quotations that Chinese medicine has been dealing with epidemic diseases for a long time and offers a range of treatment options for combating them. For the purpose of therapy, he differentiates between three stages of the disease: the suspected, the disease and the convalescence phase. In describing the interventions, acupuncture, moxibustion and ear acupuncture are of primary importance. In addition to focusing on the main therapeutic principle of strengthening the immune system, the article also mentions points for treating accompanying symptoms such as various forms of coughing, fever, weakness or nausea and vomiting. The possibilities of acupressure, Tuina and Qigong/Taiji are also considered as ways in which patients can actively participate in prevention and therapy.","Liang, Fanrong",Chinesische Med.,89,29

In the month of March 2020, teacher educators across Canada were prompted to move to online delivery of content for preservice teachers and, in many cases, this pivot was, while not simple, at least imaginable. More difficult was the integration of an online solution for the teaching practicum, a cornerstone of teacher education. The following article outlines the steps taken to ensure a credible and engaging online experiential offering. Themes were generated through the self-reflections of the design and leadership team, as well as through a survey completed by postsecondary students undertaking the online practicum. Findings included the initial challenges as noted by the design team including program and licensing requirements, as well as philosophical differences among stakeholders as to the role of practicum in teacher education. In addition, a number of important opportunities were presented by this shift to an online practicum, including the importance of the pedagogy of online learning and the need to re-vision and question the practicum.","Burns, Amy Danyluk Patricia Kapoyannis Theodora Kendrick Astrid",International Journal of E-Learning & Distance Education,89,20

Here, the dynamics of this epidemic is studied by using a generalized logistic function model and extended compartmental models with and without delays. For a chosen population, it is shown as to how forecasting may be done on the spreading of the infection by using a generalized logistic function model, which can be interpreted as a basic compartmental model. In an extended compartmental model, which is a modified form of the SEIQR model, the population is divided into susceptible, exposed, infectious, quarantined, and removed (recovered or dead) compartments, and a set of delay integral equations is used to describe the system dynamics. Time-varying infection rates are allowed in the model to capture the responses to control measures taken, and distributed delay distributions are used to capture variability in individual responses to an infection. The constructed extended compartmental model is a nonlinear dynamical system with distributed delays and time-varying parameters. The critical role of data is elucidated, and it is discussed as to how the compartmental model can be used to capture responses to various measures including quarantining. Data for different parts of the world are considered, and comparisons are also made in terms of the reproductive number.

Our hypothesis is that there are regional differences in stroke outcome depending on location during the COVID-19 study period which influences stroke epidemiology and clinical stroke practice. METHODS: The American Heart Association's 'Get with the Guidelines' (GWTG) database was used to evaluate the following categories: code stroke, diagnosis of stroke upon discharge, inpatient mortality, modified Rankin Score (mRS) upon discharge (morbidity), and time since last known well (LKW). Stroke registry data from February through June 2019 and 2020 were collected for retrospective review. RESULTS: The total number of strokes decreased in the US and CA, but increased in SHS during the COVID-19 study period. The US and SHS demonstrated no change in stroke mortality, but CA demonstrated a higher stroke mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was greater loss of independence with increased stroke morbidity in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a significant increase in time since LKW in the US and SHS, and an increase trend in time since LKW in CA during the COVID-19 study period. DISCUSSION: To understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stroke epidemiology, we propose that all stroke inpatients should receive a SARS-CoV-2 detection test and this result be entered into the GWTG database. We demonstrate that the regional distribution of stroke mortality in the US changed during the COVID-19 study period, with increased stroke mortality in CA. Stroke morbidity throughout the US was significantly worse during the COVID-19 pandemic. We propose methods to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical stroke practice such as the use of mobile stroke units, clinical trials using anti-inflammation drugs on SARS-CoV-2 positive stroke patients, and COVID stroke rehabilitation centers.","Friedlich, Daniel; Newman, Tali; Bricker, Stephanie",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,89,26

Laboratory coagulation tests showed PT, AT and platelet count (PltC) values within normal range and markedly increased D-dimer and fibrinogen levels. Viscoelastic tests showed a maximum clot strength just above normal reference value, while fibrin clot strength was strongly increased. The overall contribution of fibrin to clot strength was high with 71 [56-85]%. CONCLUSION: Anti Xa activity was within the target range of pharmacodynamic endpoint for covid-19 patients but viscoelastic tests still demonstrated a procoagulant pattern.","Vlot, E A; Van den Dool, E J; Hackeng, C M; Sohne, M; Noordzij, P G; Van Dongen, E P A",Thromb Res,89,26

Lewis (2020) currently offers his students a sector-leading portfolio of 15 different traditional research and capstone project opportunities to choose from. Our aim was therefore to share our knowledge and expertise of research and capstone project opportunities which can be undertaken remotely, and supporting resources, with colleagues globally to enable them to provide meaningful and educationally robust projects for their students. In March-August 2020, online interactive workshops were provided for colleagues. To provide scaffolding and support, Choosing Your Capstone and How to do it guides were created for students and Faculty respectively, and shared globally. Collections of simulations and large publically available datasets were also shared. Follow-up surveys of workshop participants were undertaken in December 2020. This research was approved by the University of Leeds Faculty of Biological Sciences Research Ethics Committee. The workshops attracted over 500 participants. The support resources have been viewed 11,000 times from over 50 Countries. All survey participants, representing 53 Universities within the UK and overseas, found the workshops extremely informative and inspirational. All are implementing multiple formats of non-traditional capstones as alternatives to laboratory-based research projects into their programmes in 2020-21. Eighty-six percent wish to be involved with this initiative going forward. This programme of work has shown the need for alternatives to laboratory-based research projects for students in the Biosciences, not only during the current pandemic, but going forward. By offering a portfolio of both traditional research and non-traditional capstone projects, students can select the project that best provides the experience and develops the skills required for their particular career intentions.

Objective: To investigate the prevalence of and risk factors associated with mental health symptoms in the general population in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This large-sample, cross-sectional, population-based, online survey study was conducted from February 28, 2020, to March 11, 2020. It involved all 34 province-level regions in China and included participants aged 18 years and older. Data analysis was performed from March to May 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The prevalence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and acute stress among the general population in China during the COVID-19 pandemic was evaluated using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Insomnia Severity Index, and Acute Stress Disorder Scale. Logistic regression analyses were used to explore demographic and COVID-19-related risk factors. Results: Of 71â¯227 individuals who clicked on the survey link, 56â¯932 submitted the questionnaires, for a participation rate of 79.9%. After excluding the invalid questionnaires, 56â¯679 participants (mean [SD] age, 35.97 [8.22] years; 27â¯149 men [47.9%]) were included in the study; 39â¯468 respondents (69.6%) were aged 18 to 39 years. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the rates of mental health symptoms among the survey respondents were 27.9% (95% CI, 27.5%-28.2%) for depression, 31.6% (95% CI, 31.2%-32.0%) for anxiety, 29.2% (95% CI, 28.8%-29.6%) for insomnia, and 24.4% (95% CI, 24.0%-24.7%) for acute stress. Participants with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 and their family members or friends had a high risk for symptoms of depression (adjusted odds ratios [ORs], 3.27 [95% CI, 1.84-5.80] for patients; 1.53 [95% CI, 1.26-1.85] for family or friends), anxiety (adjusted ORs, 2.48 [95% CI, 1.43-4.31] for patients; 1.53 [95% CI, 1.27-1.84] for family or friends), insomnia (adjusted ORs, 3.06 [95% CI, 1.73-5.43] for patients; 1.62 [95% CI, 1.35-1.96] for family or friends), and acute stress (adjusted ORs, 3.50 [95% CI, 2.02-6.07] for patients; 1.77 [95% CI, 1.46-2.15] for family or friends). Moreover, people with occupational exposure risks and residents in Hubei province had increased odds of symptoms of depression (adjusted ORs, 1.96 [95% CI, 1.77-2.17] for occupational exposure; 1.42 [95% CI, 1.19-1.68] for Hubei residence), anxiety (adjusted ORs, 1.93 [95% CI, 1.75-2.13] for occupational exposure; 1.54 [95% CI, 1.30-1.82] for Hubei residence), insomnia (adjusted ORs, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.45-1.77] for occupational exposure; 1.20 [95% CI, 1.01-1.42] for Hubei residence), and acute stress (adjusted ORs, 1.98 [95% CI, 1.79-2.20] for occupational exposure; 1.49 [95% CI, 1.25-1.79] for Hubei residence). Both centralized quarantine (adjusted ORs, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.10-1.61] for depression; 1.46 [95% CI, 1.22-1.75] for anxiety; 1.63 [95% CI, 1.36-1.95] for insomnia; 1.46 [95% CI, 1.21-1.77] for acute stress) and home quarantine (adjusted ORs, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.25-1.36] for depression; 1.28 [95% CI, 1.23-1.34] for anxiety; 1.24 [95% CI, 1.19-1.30] for insomnia; 1.29 [95% CI, 1.24-1.35] for acute stress) were associated with the 4 negative mental health outcomes. Being at work was associated with lower risks of depression (adjusted OR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.79-0.91]), anxiety (adjusted OR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.86-0.99]), and insomnia (adjusted OR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.81-0.94]). Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this survey indicate that mental health symptoms may have been common during the COVID-19 outbreak among the general population in China, especially among infected individuals, people with suspected infection, and people who might have contact with patients with COVID-19. Some measures, such as quarantine and delays in returning to work, were also associated with mental health among the public. These findings identify populations at risk for mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic and may help in implementing mental health intervention policies in other countries and regions.","Shi, Le; Lu, Zheng-An; Que, Jian-Yu; Huang, Xiao-Lin; Liu, Lin; Ran, Mao-Sheng; Gong, Yi-Miao; Yuan, Kai; Yan, Wei; Sun, Yan-Kun; Shi, Jie; Bao, Yan-Ping; Lu, Lin",JAMA Netw Open,89,20

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there will be a waitlist for rescheduling colonoscopies once the mitigation is lifted. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the accuracy of stool DNA methylation tests in detecting colorectal cancer. Methods/Interventions: The PubMed, Cochrane Library, and MEDLINE via Ovid were searched. Studies reporting accuracy (Sackett phase 2 or 3) of stool DNA methylation tests to detect sporadic colorectal cancer were included. The DerSimonian-Laird method with random-effects model was utilized for meta-analysis. Results/Outcome(s): Forty-six studies totaling 16,149 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled sensitivity and specificity of all single genes and combinations was 62.7% (57.7%, 67.4%) and 91% (89.5%, 92.2%), respectively. Combinations of genes provided higher sensitivity as compared to single genes [80.8% (75.1%, 85.4%) vs. 57.8% (52.3%, 63.1%)] with no significant decrease in specificity [87.8% (84.1%, 90.7%) vs. 92.1% (90.4%, 93.5%)]. The most accurate single gene was found to be SDC2 with a sensitivity of 83.1% (72.6%, 90.2%) and a specificity of 91.2% (88.6%, 93.2%). Conclusions/Discussion: Stool DNA methylation tests have high specificity with lower sensitivity allowing to rule in the diagnosis of colorectal cancer. Combination of genes increases sensitivity as compared to single gene tests. The single most accurate gene is SDC2, which should be considered in future tests.","Gachabayov, M.; Lebovics, E.; Rojas, A.; McGuirk, M.; Anderson, C.; Bergamaschi, R.",Diseases of the Colon and Rectum,89,20

Moreover, quantifying social contact mixing patterns and their variations in a rapidly evolving pandemic intervened by changing public health measures is key for retroactive evaluation and proactive assessment of the effectiveness of different age- and setting-specific interventions. Contact mixing patterns have been used to inform COVID-19 pandemic public health decision-making; but a rigorously justified methodology to identify setting-specific contact mixing patterns and their variations in a rapidly developing pandemic, which can be informed by readily available data, is in great demand and has not yet been established. Here we fill in this critical gap by developing and utilizing a novel methodology, integrating social contact patterns derived from empirical data with a disease transmission model, that enables the usage of age-stratified incidence data to infer age-specific susceptibility, daily contact mixing patterns in workplace, household, school and community settings; and transmission acquired in these settings under different physical distancing measures. We demonstrated the utility of this methodology by performing an analysis of the COVID-19 epidemic in Ontario, Canada. We quantified the age- and setting (household, workplace, community, and school)-specific mixing patterns and their evolution during the escalation of public health interventions in Ontario, Canada. We estimated a reduction in the average individual contact rate from 12.27 to 6.58 contacts per day, with an increase in household contacts, following the implementation of control measures. We also estimated increasing trends by age in both the susceptibility to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and the proportion of symptomatic individuals diagnosed. Inferring the age- and setting-specific social contact mixing and key age-stratified epidemiological parameters, in the presence of evolving control measures, is critical to inform decision- and policy-making for the current COVID-19 pandemic.","McCarthy, Zachary; Xiao, Yanyu; Scarabel, Francesca; Tang, Biao; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Nah, Kyeongah; Heffernan, Jane M; Asgary, Ali; Murty, V Kumar; Ogden, Nicholas H; Wu, Jianhong",J Math Ind,89,1

However, drug development for 3CLpro has been hindered by a lack of cell-based reporter assays that can be performed in a BSL-2 setting. Current efforts to identify 3CLpro inhibitors largely rely upon in vitro screening, which fails to account for cell permeability and cytotoxicity of compounds, or assays involving replication-competent virus, which must be performed in a BSL-3 facility. To address these limitations, we have developed a novel cell-based luciferase complementation reporter assay to identify inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro in a BSL-2 setting. The assay is based on a lentiviral vector that co-expresses 3CLpro and two luciferase fragments linked together by a 3CLpro cleavage site. 3CLpro-mediated cleavage results in a loss of complementation and low luciferase activity, whereas inhibition of 3CLpro results in 10-fold higher levels of luciferase activity. The luciferase reporter assay can easily distinguish true 3CLpro inhibition from cytotoxicity, a powerful feature that should reduce false positives during screening. Using the assay, we screened 32 small molecules for activity against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, including HIV protease inhibitors, HCV protease inhibitors, and various other compounds that have been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. Of these, only five exhibited significant inhibition of 3CLpro in cells: GC376, boceprevir, Z-FA-FMK, calpain inhibitor XII, and GRL-0496.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate urological patient satisfaction with teleconsultation during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observational, prospective, cross-sectional, non-interventional study carried out by telephone survey during the period considered as the peak of the pandemic (March-April 2020). A quality survey composed of 11 questions on urological care provided by physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted, selecting a representative sample of patients attended by teleconsultation. RESULTS: Two hundred patients were contacted by telephone to answer a survey on the quality of teleconsultation. The distribution of patients surveyed among the specialized consultations was homogeneous with the number of consultations cited in the period; 18% of them required assistance from family members. Sixty percent of patients avoided going to a medical center during the pandemic. Of the surveyed patients, 42% had cancelled diagnostic tests, 59% had cancelled medical consultations, 3.5% had cancelled treatments and 1% had cancelled interventions. Ten percent reported a worsening of urological symptoms during confinement. According to physicians, consultations were effectively delivered in 72% of cases, with teleconsultation being carried out by their usual urologist in 81%. Teleconsultation overall satisfaction level was 9 (IQI8-10), and 61.5% of respondents consider teleconsultation as a «health care option¼ after the healthcare crisis. CONCLUSION: Teleconsultation has been evaluated with a high level of satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic, offering continuous care to urological patients during the healthcare crisis. The perceived quality offers a field of optional telematic assistance in selected patients, which should be re-evaluated in a period without confinement measures.","Leibar Tamayo, A; Linares Espinós, E; Ríos González, E; Trelles Guzmán, C; Álvarez-Maestro, M; de Castro Guerín, C; Fernández-Pascual, E; Girón de Francisco, M; Gómez de Vicente, J M; Gómez Rivas, J; Mainez Rodriguez, J A; Pérez-Carral, J R; Garcia-Matres, M J; Martinez-Piñeiro, L",Actas urol. esp,89,16

The study hypothesis is that treatment with HCQ will reduce the risk of hospitalization because of Covid-19 infection, and the sample size estimate of the study is based on the need to test this hypothesis. The secondary objectives of the study are: to evaluate the safety and tolerability of HCQ in the treatment of adult patients with PCR-confirmed Covid-19 infection in a primary open-care setting, as compared to placebo; to collect experience of the use of HCQ in the treatment of Covid-19 infection in outpatients, in order to be able to identify patient characteristics that predict specific treatment responses (favourable or unfavourable); this objective will also be addressed by post-hoc subgroup analysis of the study results and by meta-analysis of pooled patient data from other clinical trials of HCQ in outpatients; and to evaluate the impact of Covid-19 infection and its treatment on the mental health and well-being of the study participants. In addition, if the data allow, the study has the following exploratory objectives: to evaluate the extent and duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding by PCR testing of nasopharyngeal swab samples in study subjects treated with HCQ, as compared to placebo; to evaluate the extent and time course of SARS-CoV-2 virus-specific antibody responses in serum of study subjects treated with HCQ, as compared to placebo; to evaluate other possible biomarker changes in blood in study subjects treated with HCQ, as compared to placebo; to explore the possible effects of genetic variation in drug metabolizing enzymes on HCQ-related outcomes in the study population; to explore the associations of HCQ-related outcome variables with other patient characteristics, e.g. HLA haplotypes, HCQ concentrations, demographic variables, disease history and concomitant medications. TRIAL DESIGN: This is a phase 2, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group treatment trial comparing HCQ with placebo in outpatients with Covid-19 infection. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the two treatment arms. PARTICIPANTS: Main inclusion criteria: 1. Males and females >40 years of age, or 18-40 years of age with one or both of the following: i. diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2); ii. BMI > 35 kg/m2; 2. Valid independent informed consent obtained; 3. Symptoms typical of Covid-19 infection, according to criteria specified in the study protocol. The onset of symptoms must be within 5 days of enrolment; 4. Positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result of a nasopharyngeal swab sample. Main exclusion criteria: 1. Suspected severe or moderately severe pneumonia, presenting with any of the following: respiratory rate > 26 breaths/min; significant respiratory distress; or SpO2 &#8804;94% on room air; 2. Requiring treatment in the hospital, according to the treating physician's judgement; 3. Any contraindication to treatment with HCQ; 4. Pregnancy or lactation. The trial will be conducted at seven study sites in a primary public health care setting in the region of Satakunta, Finland. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Participants will be randomized to receive either HCQ capsules at 300 mg twice a day for one day and then 200 mg twice a day for 6 days, or placebo capsules for 7 days. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint of the study is the number of hospitalizations due to Covid-19 infection within four weeks of entry into the study. The secondary endpoints of the study include the following: duration and severity of Covid-19-related symptoms, as reported by daily self-assessments; number of Intensive Care Unit treatment episodes due to Covid-19 infection within four weeks of entry into the study; number of deaths due to Covid-19 infection within four weeks of entry into the study; number of treatment-related adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs); all-cause hospitalizations and mortality within six months of entry into the study; and self-assessed symptoms of anxiety, as assessed with repeated administration of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7). The exploratory endpoints of the study include the following: extent and duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding and virus-specific antibody responses in serum; and possible other blood biomarker changes. RANDOMISATION: Eligible study participants are randomly allocated into two treatment arms (1:1 ratio). The randomization list has been generated using Viedoc&#8482; (Viedoc Technologies AB, Uppsala, Sweden) that is used as an electronic data capture system for this study. BLINDING (MASKING): The participants and all study personnel remain blinded to the treatment allocation by having both IMPs packed in identical containers. Masking of the treatments was performed by re-formulation of the IMPs so that the HCQ capsules and the placebo capsules have identical appearance. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): 600 participants are to be randomised with 300 in each arm. TRIAL STATUS: Protocol version 2, dated 14 July 2020; recruitment is expected to start in December, 2020, and to be completed in June, 2021.

This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine (Hereinafter referred to as ""Integrated Medicine"") to COVID-19. We searched six major Chinese and English databases to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case-control studies (CCSs) of Integrated Medicine on COVID-19. Two reviewers independently screened, identified studies, and extracted data. Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale were used to assess the quality of included RCTs and CCSs, respectively. Stata (version 13.0; StataCorp) was used to perform meta-analyses with the random-effects model. Risk ratio (RR) was used for dichotomous data while the weighted mean difference (WMD) was adopted for continuous variables as effect size, both of which were demonstrated in effect size and 95% confidence intervals (CI). A total of 11 studies were included. Four were RCTs and seven were CCSs. The sample size of including studies ranged from 42 to 200 (total 982). The traditional Chinese medicine included Chinese medicine compound drugs (QingFei TouXie FuZhengFang) and Chinese patent medicine (e.g. Shufeng Jiedu Capsule, Lianhua Qingwen granules). Compared with the control group, the overall response rate [RRâ¯=â¯1.230, 95%CI (1.113, 1.359), Pâ¯=â¯0.000], cure rate [RRâ¯=â¯1.604, 95%CI (1.181, 2.177), Pâ¯=â¯0.002], severity illness rate [RRâ¯=â¯0.350, 95%CI (0.154, 0.792), Pâ¯=â¯0.012], and hospital stay [WMDâ¯=â¯-1.991, 95%CI (-3.278, -0.703), Pâ¯=â¯0.002] of the intervention group were better. In addition, Integrated Medicine can improve the disappearance rate of fever, cough, expectoration, fatigue, chest tightness and anorexia and reduce patients' fever, and fatigue time (Pâ¯<â¯0.05). This review found that Integrated Medicine had better effects and did not increase adverse drug reactions for COVID-19.

Much remains unknown about detailed symptomatic features of COVID-19 onset and rehabilitation. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 932 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan were enrolled, including 52 severe cases and 880 non-severe cases. The symptomatic features were analyzed and compared between the severe and non-severe groups. All patients were followed up 3 months after discharge. RESULTS: Of the 932 patients, fever (60%), cough (50.8%), and fatigue (36.4%) were the most common symptoms, followed by anorexia (21.8%) and dyspnea (19.2%). The median duration of fever was 7 days, which was characterized by persistent low fever. The median duration of cough was 17 days, characterized by dry cough without sputum. Most dyspnea occurred on the fourth day after illness onset, with a median duration of 16 days. The incidences of taste loss and olfactory disturbance were only 6.2% and 3.1%, respectively. After adjusting age and gender, multivariate regression analysis showed that fever lasting for more than 5 days (OR 1.90, 95%CI 1.00-3.62, P = 0.0498), anorexia at onset (2.61, 1.26-5.40, P = 0.0096), and modified Medical Research Council level above grade 2 when dyspnea occurred (14.19, 7.01-28.71, P < 0.0001) were symptomatic risk factors for severe COVID-19. Through follow-up, cough (6.2%), dyspnea (7.2%), fatigue (1.8%), olfactory and taste disorders (1.5%) were the significant remaining symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 caused clusters of symptoms with multiple systems involved. Certain symptomatic characteristics have predictive value for severe COVID-19. Short-term follow-up showed that most patients had a good prognosis.","Sun, Liang-Liang; Wang, Jian; Wang, Yu-Sheng; Hu, Ping-Fang; Zhao, Zheng-Qing; Chen, Wei; Ning, Bei-Fang; Yin, Chuan; Hao, Yu-Shi; Wang, Qiong; Wang, Chen; Liu, Ya-Long; Chen, Cheng; Yin, Ji-Zhong; Huang, Hai; Xie, Wei-Fen",J. dig. dis,89,26

Very little is known about the infection mechanism for this virus. More importantly, there are no drugs or vaccines that can cure or prevent a person from getting COVID-19. In this study, the binding affinity of 2692 protease inhibitor compounds that are known in the protein data bank, are calculated against the main protease of the novel coronavirus with docking and molecular dynamics (MD). Both the docking and MD methods predict the macrocyclic tissue factor-factor VIIa (PubChem ID: 118098670) inhibitor to bind strongly with the main protease with a binding affinity of -10.6 and -10.0 kcal/mol, respectively. The TF-FVIIa inhibitors are known to prevent the coagulation of blood and have antiviral activity as shown in the case of SARS coronavirus. Two more inhibitors, phenyltriazolinones (PubChem ID: 104161460) and allosteric HCV NS5B polymerase thumb pocket 2 (PubChem ID: 163632044) have shown antiviral activity and also have high affinity towards the main protease of COVID-19. Furthermore, these inhibitors interact with the catalytic dyad in the active site of the COVID-19 main protease that is especially important in viral replication. The calculated theoretical dissociation constants of the proposed COVID-19 inhibitors are found to be very similar to the experimental dissociation constant values of similar protease-inhibitor systems.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

After dividing 2344 eligible patients randomly into a training set and a validation set, we first identified and scored five parameters, that is, age, sex, performance status, HCT-comorbidity index (HCT-CI), and donor type, on the basis of their impact on non-relapse mortality for patients in the training set. The non-relapse mortality-J (NRM-J) index using the sum of these scores was then applied to patients in the validation set, resulting in a clear differentiation of non-relapse mortality, with expected 2-year rates of 11%, 16%, 27%, and 33%, respectively (P < 0.001). The estimated c-statistic was 0.67, which was significantly higher than that of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation score (0.60, P = 0.002) and the HCT-CI (0.57, P < 0.001). The NRM-J index showed a significant association with overall survival, but not with relapse. Our findings demonstrate that the NRM-J index is useful for predicting post-transplant non-relapse mortality for patients with AML in first CR, for whom the decision of whether to perform allogeneic HCT is critical.","Yanada, Masamitsu; Konuma, Takaaki; Mizuno, Shohei; Saburi, Masuho; Shinohara, Akihito; Tanaka, Masatsugu; Marumo, Atsushi; Sawa, Masashi; Uchida, Naoyuki; Ozawa, Yukiyasu; Onizuka, Makoto; Yoshioka, Satoshi; Nakamae, Hirohisa; Kondo, Tadakazu; Kimura, Takafumi; Kanda, Junya; Fukuda, Takahiro; Atsuta, Yoshiko; Nakasone, Hideki; Yano, Shingo",Bone marrow transplant,89,29

These optimal interventions allow policymakers to manage NPIs to minimize the epidemiological and human health impacts of both COVID-19 and the intervention itself. Here, we use a susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) mathematical model to explore the feasibility of optimizing the duration, magnitude and trigger point of five different NPI scenarios to minimize the peak prevalence or the attack rate of a simulated UK COVID-19 outbreak. An optimal parameter space to minimize the peak prevalence or the attack rate was identified for each intervention scenario, with each scenario differing with regard to how reductions to transmission were modelled. However, we show that these optimal interventions are fragile, sensitive to epidemiological uncertainty and prone to implementation error. We highlight the use of robust, but suboptimal interventions as an alternative, with these interventions capable of mitigating the peak prevalence or the attack rate over a broader, more achievable parameter space, but being less efficacious than theoretically optimal interventions. This work provides an illustrative example of the concept of intervention optimization across a range of different NPI strategies.

This initial webinar included 41 live participants and an additional 40 views within one week of posting the recording. Event responses prompted creation of the Beef Brunch Educational Series, an online series designed to maintain engagement and allow agents to present timely management recommendations and industry news to producers. Live webinars occur at 10:30 a.m. on the second Tuesday of each month. Webinars are also recorded for online distribution through the LSU AgCenter website, LSU AgCenter-Livestock YouTube channel, and podcast platforms. Bi-weekly news updates are released on the same platforms. News updates feature weather and pasture conditions, market outlooks, management tips, events, and current industry topics. Webinar engagement on all platforms averages 233 viewers with a growth range of 81 to 859 since April. News updates average 87 views with a growth range of 29 to 270 participants. When asked, 85% of viewers strongly agreed or agreed that information learned in webinars would be applied to their operations. Extension agents utilize this program for professional development, with 75% strongly agreeing or agreeing that webinars increased confidence to apply presented knowledge and 70% stating they have or plan to incorporate news update content in their programming. Thus, increased views, positive feedback, and requests for more information illustrate relevance in continuing the Beef Brunch Educational Series beyond the COVID-19 pandemic and optimistically developing it into a leading informational source for beef cattle producers in Louisiana.

While battling for the disease in China, six Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) recipes have been shown to be remarkably effective for treating patients with COVID-19. The present review discusses principles of TCM in curing infectious disease, and clinical evidence and mechanisms of the 6 most effective TCM recipes used in treating COVID-19 in 92% of all of the confirmed cases in China. Applications of TCM and specific recipes in the treatment of other viral infections, such as those caused by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, influenza A virus (including H1N1 and H7N9), influenza B, dengue virus as well as Ebola virus, are also discussed. Among the 6 TCM recipes, Jinhua Qinggan (JHQG) granules and Lianhua Qingwen (LHQW) capsules are recommended during medical observation; Lung Cleansing and Detoxifying Decoction (LCDD) is recommended for the treatment of both severe and non-severe patients; Xuanfeibaidu (XFBD) granules are recommended for treating moderate cases; while Huashibaidu (HSBD) and Xuebijing (XBJ) have been used in managing severe cases effectively. The common components and the active ingredients of the six TCM recipes have been summarized to reveal most promising drug candidates.

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses a great threat to public health worldwide. However, some parts of the globe have been worse affected in terms of prevalence and deaths than others. The causes and conditions of such variations have yet to be explored. Although some studies indicated a possible correlation between air pollution and COVID-19 severity, there is yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer. This review summarizes the impact of air pollution on COVID-19 infections and severity and discusses the possible management strategies and challenges involved. The available literature investigating the correlation between air pollution and COVID-19 infections and mortality are included in the review. The studies reviewed here suggest that exposure to air pollution, particularly to PM2.5 and NO2 , is positively correlated with COVID-19 infections and mortality. Some data indicate that air pollution can play an important role in the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. A high percentage of COVID-19 incidences has been reported in the most polluted areas, where patients needed hospital admission. The available data also show that both short-term and long-term air pollution may enhance COVID-19 severity. However, most of the studies that showed a link between air pollution and COVID-19 infections and mortality did not consider potential confounders during the correlation analysis. Therefore, more specific studies need to be performed focusing on some additional confounders such as individual age, population density, and pre-existing comorbidities to determine the impact of air pollution on COVID-19 infections and deaths.

The continuous process was based on the generation of hydroxyl-radicals via the UV-C (254 nm) photo-degradation of hydrogen peroxide and ozone. The decontamination efficacy of the gAOP was dependent on the orientation of the N95 mask passing through the gAOP unit with those positioned horizontally enabling greater exposure to hydroxyl-radicals compared to when arranged vertically. The lethality of gAOP was independent of the applied hydrogen peroxide concentration (2-6% v/v) but was significantly (P<0.05) higher when H2O2 was introduced into the unit at 40 ml/min compared to 20 ml/min. A suitable treatment for N95 masks was identified as 3% v/v hydrogen peroxide delivered into the gAOP reactor at 40 ml/min with continuous introduction of ozone gas and a UV-C dose of 113 mJ/cm2 (30 s processing time). The treatment supported >6 log CFU decrease in Geobacillus stearothermophilus endospores, > 8 log reduction of human coronavirus 229E, and no detection of Escherichia coli K12 on the interior and exterior of masks. There was no negative effect on the N95 mask fitting or particulate efficacy after 20 passes through the gAOP system. No visual changes or hydrogen peroxide residues were detected (<1 ppm) in gAOP treated masks. The optimized gAOP treatment could also support >6 log CFU reduction of endospores inoculated on the interior or exterior of surgical masks. G. stearothermophilus Apex spore strips could be applied as a biological indicator to verify the performance of gAOP treatment. Also, a chemical indicator based on the oxidative polymerization of pyrrole was found suitable for reporting the generation of hydroxyl-radicals. In conclusion, gAOP is a verifiable treatment that can be applied to decontaminate N95 and surgical masks without any negative effects on functionality.","Hasani, Mahdiyeh; Campbell, Tracey; Wu, Fan; Warriner, Keith",PLoS One,89,16

Because modulating -1 PRF can attenuate the virus, ligands binding to the RNA pseudoknot that stimulates -1 PRF may have therapeutic potential. Mutations in the pseudoknot have occurred during the pandemic, but how they affect -1 PRF efficiency and ligand activity is unknown. Studying a panel of six mutations in key regions of the pseudoknot, we found that most did not change -1 PRF levels, even when base-pairing was disrupted, but one led to a striking 3-fold decrease, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 may be less sensitive to -1 PRF modulation than expected. Examining the effects of a small-molecule -1 PRF inhibitor active against SARS-CoV-2, it had a similar effect on all mutants tested, regardless of basal -1 PRF efficiency, indicating that anti-frameshifting activity can be resistant to natural pseudoknot mutations. These results have important implications for therapeutic strategies targeting SARS-CoV-2 through modulation of -1 PRF.","Neupane, Krishna; Munshi, Sneha; Zhao, Meng; Ritchie, Dustin B; Ileperuma, Sandaru M; Woodside, Michael T",J Mol Biol,89,16

Because the primary trial endpoint was vaccine efficacy (VE) against symptomatic disease, there are limited data on the extent to which vaccines protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection and the ability to infect others (infectiousness). Assumptions about VE against infection and infectiousness have implications for changes to infection prevention guidance for vaccinated populations, including testing strategies. METHODS: We use a stochastic agent-based SEIR model of a nursing home to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We model three scenarios, varying VE against infection, infectiousness, and symptoms, to understand the expected impact of vaccination in nursing homes, increasing staff vaccination coverage, and different screening testing strategies under each scenario. RESULTS: Increasing vaccination coverage in staff decreases total symptomatic cases in the nursing home (among staff and residents combined) in each VE scenario. In scenarios with 50% and 90% VE against infection and infectiousness, increasing staff coverage reduces symptomatic cases among residents. If vaccination only protects against symptoms, and asymptomatic cases remain infectious, increased staff coverage increases symptomatic cases among residents. However, this is outweighed by the reduction in symptomatic cases among staff. Higher frequency testing-more than once weekly-is needed to reduce total symptomatic cases if the vaccine has lower efficacy against infection and infectiousness, or only protects against symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Encouraging staff vaccination is not only important for protecting staff, but might also reduce symptomatic cases in residents if a vaccine confers at least some protection against infection or infectiousness.","Kahn, Rebecca; Holmdahl, Inga; Reddy, Sujan; Jernigan, John; Mina, Michael J; Slayton, Rachel B",Clin. infect. dis,89,14

RESULTS: SARS-COV-2 RNA was positive as early as day four. It remained positive until day 55 post-onset in the sputum-throat swabs and became negative in most cases (55%) within 14 days after onset. Lymphocytopenia occurred in 40% (8/20) of patients during the peak infection period and returned to normal at week five. The most severe inflammation in the lungs appeared in week 2 or 3 after onset, and this was completely absorbed between week 6 and 8 in 85.7% of patients.

The present study aimed to identify the predictors of turnover intention based on psychosocial factors in nurses of Ardabil pre-hospital emergency and educational and medical centres during the COVID-19 outbreak. DESIGN: The present descriptive-analytical study was conducted in June, 2020. METHODS: A total of 479 nurses working in Ardabil pre-hospital emergency and educational and medical centres to fight COVID-19 were recruited for this study using the census method. Data were collected using the Demographic Information Questionnaire, Turnover Intention Questionnaire, Weiss & Marmar Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), General Health Questionnaire (12 C-GHQ) and Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ). Data were analysed with SPSSv.22 software using correlation, t test, analysis of variance, multiple regression and descriptive tests. RESULTS: The mean turnover intention score of nurses was 41.73 with a standard deviation of 12.11. The results of correlation coefficient revealed a positive relationship between PTSD, general health, job demand and job strain with turnover intention (p &#8804; .01) and a positive and significant relationship between social support and turnover intention (p &#8804; .01). Multiple regression analysis showed that the variables of gender, marital status, work position, decision latitude, social support, job strain, general health and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were predictors of turnover intention. CONCLUSION: Job stressors during the COVID-19 outbreak have led to an increase in nurses' turnover intention.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate possible associations between aneurysm hemodynamic and geometric characteristics and the development of blebs in intracranial aneurysms. METHODS: A total of 270 IAs in 199 patients selected for surgical clipping were studied. Blebs were visually identified and interactively marked on patient-specific vascular models constructed from presurgical images. Blebs were then deleted from the vascular reconstruction to approximate the aneurysm before bleb formation. Computational fluid dynamics studies were performed in these models and in cases without blebs. Hemodynamic and geometric characteristics of aneurysms with and without blebs were compared. RESULTS: A total of 173 aneurysms had no blebs, while 97 aneurysms had a total of 122 blebs. Aneurysms favoring bleb formation had stronger (p<0.0001) and more concentrated inflow jets (p<0.0001), higher flow velocity (p=0.0061), more complex (p<0.0001) and unstable (p=0.0157) flow patterns, larger maximum wall shear stress (WSS; p<0.0001), more concentrated (p=0.0005) and oscillatory (p=0.0004) WSS distribution, and a more heterogeneous WSS field (p<0.0001), than aneurysms without blebs. They were also larger (p<0.0001), more elongated (p<0.0001), had wider necks (p=0.0002), and more distorted and irregular shapes (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Strong and concentrated inflow jets, high-speed, complex, and unstable flow patterns, and concentrated, oscillatory, and heterogeneous WSS patterns favor the formation of blebs in IAs. Blebs are more likely to form in large, elongated, and irregularly shaped aneurysms. These adverse characteristics could be considered signs of aneurysm instability when evaluating aneurysms for conservative observation or treatment.","Salimi Ashkezari, Seyedeh Fatemeh; Mut, Fernando; Chung, Bong Jae; Robertson, Anne M; Cebral, Juan R",J. neurointerv. surg.

Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is developed from live-attenuated Mycobacterium bovis, which is a microorganism found in a cow. Discovered by Dr. Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin since 1921, the BCG has served as a protection against tuberculosis and its complications. It is noticeable that countries which use mandatory BCG vaccination approach had lower COVID-19 infection and death rate. Current review aims to clarify this issue through epidemiological illustration of correlation between national BCG immunization and COVID-19 mortality, in addition to biological background of BCG-induced immunity Epidemiological data shows that universal BCG policy countries have lower median mortality rate compare to countries with past universal BCG policy and non-mass immunization BCG. (18 May 2020). Still, the links between BCG vaccination and better COVID-19 situation in certain countries are unclear, and more data on actual infection rate using SAR-CoV-2 antibody testing in large population sample is crucial for disease spreading comparison. Two immunological mechanisms, heterologous effects of adaptive immunity and trained innate immunity which induced by BCG vaccination, may explain host tolerance against COVID-19 infection, however, there is no direct evidence to support this biological background. Clinical trials related to BCG vaccination against COVID-19 are under investigation. Without a strong evidence, BCG must not be recommended for COVID-19 prevention, although, this should not be absolute contraindication.

Common CNS-related symptoms include anosmia, caused by viral interaction with either neurons or supporting cells in nasal olfactory tissues. Diffuse encephalopathy is the most common sign of CNS dysfunction, which likely results from the CNS consequences of the systemic inflammatory syndrome associated with severe COVID-19. Additionally, microvascular injuries and thromboembolic events likely contribute to the neurologic impact of acute COVID-19. These observations are supported by evidence of CNS immune activation in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in autopsy tissue, along with the detection of microvascular injuries in both pathological and neuroimaging studies. The frequent occurrence of thromboembolic events in patients with COVID-19 has generated different hypotheses, among which viral interaction with perivascular cells is particularly attractive, yet unproven. A distinguishing feature of CSF findings in SARS-CoV-2 infection is that clinical signs characteristic of neurotropic viral infections (CSF pleocytosis and blood-brain barrier injury) are mild or absent. Moreover, virus detection in CSF is rare and often of uncertain significance. In this review, we provide an overview of the neurological impact that occurs in the acute phase of COVID-19, and the role of CSF biomarkers in the clinical management and research to better treat and understand the disease. In addition to aiding as diagnostic and prognostic tools during acute infection, the use of comprehensive and well-characterized CSF and blood biomarkers will be vital in understanding the potential impact on the CNS in the rapidly increasing number of individuals recovering from COVID-19.","Edén, Arvid; Simrén, Joel; Price, Richard W; Zetterberg, Henrik; Gisslén, Magnus",J. neurochem,89,27

The cumulative curve of the phenomenon was analyzed to show the extent of the pandemic's decline or spread. On the other hand, the time curve of the number of cases of the pandemic was fitted based on a set of mathematical and statistical models, which were divided into three sections [nonlinear growth model, Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered (SEIR) model, regression model] to attain the best possible fitting of the relationship curve. The results show that the Weibull model and Polynomial model at (n = 4) are the best models for fitting the relationship at short run and the SEIR model gives better relationship fitting at long run.

The identification of ACE2 in as many as 72 tissues suggests that extrapulmonary invasion and damage is likely, which indeed has already been demonstrated by cardiovascular and gastrointestinal symptoms. On the other hand, identifying ACE2 dysregulation in patients with comorbidities may offer insight as to why COVID-19 symptoms are often more severe in these individuals. This may be attributed to a pre-existing proinflammatory state that is further propelled with the cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection or the loss of functional ACE2 expression as a result of viral internalization. Here, we aim to characterize the distribution and role of ACE2 in various organs to highlight the scope of damage that may arise upon SARS-CoV-2 invasion. Furthermore, by examining the disruption of ACE2 in several comorbid diseases, we offer insight into potential causes of increased severity of COVID-19 symptoms in certain individuals. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Cell surface expression of ACE2 determines the tissue susceptibility for coronavirus infectious disease 2019 infection. Comorbid disease conditions altering ACE2 expression could increase the patient's vulnerability for the disease and its complications, either directly, through modulation of viral infection, or indirectly, through alteration of inflammatory status.","Hammoud, Safaa H; Wehbe, Zena; Abdelhady, Samar; Kobeissy, Firas; Eid, Ali H; El-Yazbi, Ahmed F",Mol Pharmacol,89,1

In this special context, the French Rare Health Care for Neuromuscular Diseases Network (FILNEMUS) has established guidance in an attempt to homogenize the management of neuromuscular (NM) patients within the French territory. Hospitalization should be reserved for emergencies, the conduct of treatments that cannot be postponed, check-ups for which the diagnostic delay may result in a loss of survival chance, and cardiorespiratory assessments for which the delay could be detrimental to the patient. A national strategy was adopted during a period of 1 to 2months concerning treatments usually administered in hospitalization. NM patients treated with steroid/immunosuppressants for a dysimmune pathology should continue all of their treatments in the absence of any manifestations suggestive of COVID-19. A frequently asked questions (FAQ) sheet has been compiled and updated on the FILNEMUS website. Various support systems for self-rehabilitation and guided exercises have been also provided on the website. In the context of NM diseases, particular attention must be paid to two experimental COVID-19 treatments, hydroxycholoroquine and azithromycin: risk of exacerbation of myasthenia gravis and QT prolongation in patients with pre-existing cardiac involvement. The unfavorable emergency context related to COVID-19 may specially affect the potential for intensive care admission (ICU) for people with NMD.

After the filament started to erupt, two flare ribbons formed, one of which had a well-visible hook enclosing a core (twin) dimming region. Along multiple funnels located in this dimming, a motion of plasma directed outwards started to be visible in the 171\,\AA~and 193\,\AA~filter channels of the instrument. In time-distance diagrams, this motion generated a strip-like pattern, which lasted for more than five hours and which characteristics did not change along the funnel. We therefore suggest the motion to be a signature of outflows corresponding to velocities ranging between $\approx70$ and 140 km\,s$^{-1}$. Interestingly, the pattern of the outflows as well as their velocities were found to be similar to those we observed in a neighboring ordinary coronal hole. Therefore, the outflows were most likely a signature of a CME-induced slow solar wind flowing along the open-field structures rooted in the dimming region. Further, the evolution of the hook encircling the dimming region was examined in the context of the latest predictions imposed for the three-dimensional magnetic reconnection. The observations indicate that the filament's footpoints were, during their transformation to the dimming region, reconnecting with surrounding canopies. To our knowledge, our observations present the first imaging evidence for outflows of plasma from a dimming region.","Lorinvc'ik, Juraj; Dud'ik, Jaroslav; Aulanier, Guillaume; Schmieder, Brigitte; Golub, Leon",,89,24

How the physical properties of vaccine carriers such as mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) influence this cascade is unclear. We fabricated 80-nm MSNs with different pore sizes (7.8 nm, 10.3 nm, and 12.9 nm) and loaded them with ovalbumin antigen. Results demonstrated these MSNs with different pore sizes were equally effective in the first three steps of the DUMP cascade, but those with larger pores showed higher cross-presentation efficiency (step 4). Consistently, large-pore MSNs loaded with B16F10 tumor antigens yielded the strongest antitumor effects. These results demonstrate the promise of our lymph node-targeting large-pore MSNs as vaccine-delivery vehicles for immune activation and cancer vaccination.","Hong, Xiaoyu; Zhong, Xiaofang; Du, Guangsheng; Hou, Yingying; Zhang, Yunting; Zhang, Zhirong; Gong, Tao; Zhang, Ling; Sun, Xun",Sci.

However, robust data are lacking on the relative performance of available rapid molecular tests across a full range of viral concentrations. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare two recently-authorized rapid tests, Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 and Abbott ID Now SARS-CoV-2, to the Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay for samples with low, medium, and high viral concentrations. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 113 nasopharyngeal swabs from remnant patient samples were tested, including 88 positives spanning the full range of observed Ct values on the cobas assay. RESULTS: Compared to cobas, the overall positive agreement was 73.9% with ID Now and 98.9% with Xpert. Negative agreement was 100% and 92.0% for ID Now and Xpert, respectively. Both ID Now and Xpert showed 100% positive agreement for medium and high viral concentrations (Ct value <30). However, for Ct values >30, positive agreement was 34.3% for ID Now and 97.1% for Xpert. CONCLUSIONS: While Xpert showed high agreement with cobas across a wide range of viral concentrations, this study highlights an important limitation of ID Now for specimens collected in viral or universal transport media with low viral concentrations.

Of note, ACE2 is responsible for the host cell entry of the virus. METHODS: We extracted data on 575 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) of Humanitas Center, between February 21 and April 14, 2020. The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of chronic treatment with ACE-I or ARBs and other clinical predictors on in-hospital mortality in a cohort of COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed that a chronic intake of ACE-I was associated with a trend in reduction of mortality (OR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.27-1.03; p = 0.06), differently from a chronic intake of ARB (OR: 1.1; 95% CI: 0.5-2.8; p=0.8). Increased age (ORs ranging from 3.4 to 25.2 and to 39.5 for 60-70, 70-80 and >80 years vs <60) and cardiovascular comorbidities (OR: 1.90; 95% CI: 1.1-3.3; p = 0.02) were confirmed as important risk factors for COVID-19 mortality. Timely treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in ED was found to be protective (OR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.21-0.62; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This study can contribute to understand the reasons behind the high mortality rate of patients in Lombardy, a region which accounts for >50% of total Italian deaths. Based on our findings, we support that daily intake of antihypertensive medications in the setting of COVID-19 should not be discontinued and that a timely LMWH administration in ED has shown to decrease in-hospital mortality.","Desai, Antonio; Voza, Giuseppe; Paiardi, Silvia; Teofilo, Francesca Ilaria; Caltagirone, Giuseppe; Pons, Marta Ripoll; Aloise, Monia; Kogan, Maria; Tommasini, Tobia; Savevski, Victor; Stefanini, Giulio; Angelini, Claudio; Ciccarelli, Michele; Badalamenti, Salvatore; De Nalda, Ana Lleo; Aghemo, Alessio; Cecconi, Maurizio; Martinelli Boneschi, Filippo; Voza, Antonio",Int. j. cardiol,89,21

Previously, we determined the virus stability on different types of surfaces under indoor and seasonal climatic conditions. SARS-CoV-2 survived the longest on surfaces under winter conditions, followed by spring/fall and summer conditions, suggesting the seasonal pattern of stability on surfaces. However, under natural conditions, the virus is secreted in various biological fluids from infected humans. In this respect, it remains unclear how long the virus survives in various types of biological fluids. This study explores SARS-CoV-2 stability in virus-spiked human biological fluids under different environmental conditions by determining the virus half-life. The virus was stable for up to 21 days in nasal mucus, sputum, saliva, tear, urine, blood, and semen;it remained infectious significantly longer under winter and spring/fall conditions than under summer conditions. In contrast, the virus was only stable up to 24 h in feces and breast milk. These findings demonstrate the potential risk of infectious biological fluids in SARS-CoV-2 transmission and have implications for its seasonality.","Kwon, T.; Gaudreault, N. N.; Richt, J.

Vital sign trends are routinely used to monitor patients with changes in these parameters often preceding an adverse event. Wearable sensors can measure vital signs continuously (e.g. heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature) remotely and can be utilised to recognise early clinical deterioration. METHODS: We describe the protocol for a pilot, proof-of-concept, observational study to be conducted in an engineered hotel near London airports, UK. The study is set to continue for the duration of the pandemic. Individuals arriving to London with mild symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 or returning from high-risk areas requiring quarantine, as recommended by the Public Health England, or healthcare professionals with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 unable to isolate at home will be eligible for a wearable patch to be applied for the duration of their stay. Notifications will be generated should deterioration be detected through the sensor and displayed on a central monitoring hub viewed by nursing staff, allowing for trend deterioration to be noted. The primary objective is to determine the feasibility of remote monitoring systems in detecting clinical deterioration for quarantined individuals in a hotel. DISCUSSION: This trial should prove the feasibility of a rapidly implemented model of healthcare delivery through remote monitoring during a global pandemic at a hotel, acting as an extension to a healthcare trust. Potential benefits would include reducing infection risk of COVID-19 to healthcare staff, with earlier recognition of clinical deterioration through ambulatory, continuous, remote monitoring using a discrete wearable sensor.

Because the virus is transmitted predominantly by inhaling respiratory droplets from infected persons, universal mask use can help reduce transmission (1). Starting in April, 39 states and the District of Columbia (DC) issued mask mandates in 2020. Reducing person-to-person interactions by avoiding nonessential shared spaces, such as restaurants, where interactions are typically unmasked and physical distancing (&#8805;6 ft) is difficult to maintain, can also decrease transmission (2). In March and April 2020, 49 states and DC prohibited any on-premises dining at restaurants, but by mid-June, all states and DC had lifted these restrictions. To examine the association of state-issued mask mandates and allowing on-premises restaurant dining with COVID-19 cases and deaths during March 1-December 31, 2020, county-level data on mask mandates and restaurant reopenings were compared with county-level changes in COVID-19 case and death growth rates relative to the mandate implementation and reopening dates. Mask mandates were associated with decreases in daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates 1-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61-80, and 81-100 days after implementation. Allowing any on-premises dining at restaurants was associated with increases in daily COVID-19 case growth rates 41-60, 61-80, and 81-100 days after reopening, and increases in daily COVID-19 death growth rates 61-80 and 81-100 days after reopening. Implementing mask mandates was associated with reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission, whereas reopening restaurants for on-premises dining was associated with increased transmission. Policies that require universal mask use and restrict any on-premises restaurant dining are important components of a comprehensive strategy to reduce exposure to and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (1). Such efforts are increasingly important given the emergence of highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants in the United States (3,4).","Guy, Gery P; Lee, Florence C; Sunshine, Gregory; McCord, Russell; Howard-Williams, Mara; Kompaniyets, Lyudmyla; Dunphy, Christopher; Gakh, Maxim; Weber, Regen; Sauber-Schatz, Erin; Omura, John D; Massetti, Greta M",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,89,21

Methods: Epidemiological, business and economic data were extracted from official government sources covering the period 31st January to 13th August 2020; healthcare system data up to end of June 2019. Results: UK-wide COVID-19 cases and deaths were 313,798 and 46,706 respectively (472 cases and 70 deaths per 100,000 population) by 12th August. There were regional variations in England, with London and North West (756 and 666 cases per 100,000 population respectively) disproportionately affected compared with other regions. As of 11th August, 13,618,470 tests had been conducted in the UK. Increased risk of mortality was associated with age (&#8805;60 years), gender (male) and BAME groups. Since onset of the pandemic, emergency department attendance, primary care utilisation and cancer referrals and inpatient/outpatient referrals have declined; emergency ambulance and NHS111 calls increased. Business sectors most impacted are the arts, entertainment and recreation, followed by accommodation and food services. Government interventions aimed at curtailing the business and economic impact have been implemented, but applications for state benefits have increased. Conclusions: The impact of COVID-19 on the UK population, health system and economy has been profound. More data are needed to implement the optimal policy and technological responses to preventing further spikes in COVID-19 cases, and to inform strategic planning to manage future pandemics.","Flynn, Darren; Moloney, Eoin; Bhattarai, Nawaraj; Scott, Jason; Breckons, Matthew; Avery, Leah; Moy, Naomi",,89,32

The clinical presentation and disease severity is common in both the infection condition. The present paper deals with studying co-infection model system through systems biology approaches. Understanding signaling regulation in COVID-19 and co-infection model systems aid in the development of network-based models thereby suggesting intervention points for therapeutics. This paper highlights the aim of revealing such perturbations to decipher opportune mediating cross talks characterizing the deadly viral disease. The comparative analysis of both the models reveals major signaling protein NFκB and STAT1 playing a crucial role in establishing co-infection. By targeting these proteins at cellular level, it might help modulating the release of potent pro-inflammatory cytokines thereby taming the severity of the disease symptoms. Mathematical models developed here are precisely tailored and serves as a first step towards co-infection model offering flexibility and pitching towards therapeutic investigation.","Soni, Bhavnita; Singh, Shailza",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,89,20

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of lockdown on physical activity and sedentary behaviour. METHODS: A total of 1565 Dutch CVD patients participated in this prospective cohort study, in which we compared physical activity and sedentary behaviour before and during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Baseline measures were assessed in 2018 and data on follow-up measures were collected between 17 and 24 April 2020 (5 weeks after the introduction of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions). Validated questionnaires were used to assess physical activity and sedentary behaviour. RESULTS: Moderate-to-vigorous physical activities increased from 1.6 (0.9, 2.8) to 2.0 (1.0, 3.5) h/day [median (interquartile range)] (p < 0.001) during the COVID-19 lockdown, mainly due to an increase in time spent walking and doing odd jobs. In contrast, time spent exercising significantly declined [1.0 (0.0, 2.3) to 0.0 (0.0, 0.6) h/week], whereas sedentary time increased from 7.8 (6.1, 10.4) to 8.9 (6.8, 11.4) h/day (p < 0.001). The absolute increase in physical activity was 13 (−36, 81) min/day, whereas sedentary behaviour increased by 55 (−72, 186) min/day. CONCLUSION: Despite a small increase in physical activities, the larger increase in sedentary time induced a net reduction in habitual physical activity levels in Dutch CVD patients during the first-wave COVID-19 lockdown. Since a more inactive lifestyle is strongly associated with disease progression and mortality, we encourage CVD patients and their caregivers to explore novel solutions to increase physical activity levels and reduce sedentary time during (and beyond) the COVID-19 pandemic.","van Bakel, B.

This study aims to find out the reasons of Non-adherence to ATT in patients receiving anti-tubercular treatment at DIRECTLY OBSERVED TREATMENT SHORTCOURSE (DOTS) Centre at District Tuberculosis Centre (DTC), Kalibadi, Raipur during COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted at Department of Pharmacology, Pt. JNM Medical College and DTC Kalibadi Raipur. 55 Patients taking ATT fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria were interviewed using structured questionnaire. The data obtained was analysed to know causes of non-adherence. RESULTS: Study was carried out between March & April 2020. In our study, 80% subjects were male and 20% were female. The main reasons for Non-adherence were Side-effects of drug in 36% cases, missing medication intentionally in 34% cases, lack of encouragement by family members in 32% cases, patient’s unawareness of consequences of skipping medication in 25% cases, unaware of treatment duration in 22%, not feeling any change, forgetting to take medication, and burden of concomitant medication besides ATT, each in 20% cases, 13% cases had difficulty in procuring medication due to lockdown, 5%. cases did not go to collect their medicine due to fear of contracting COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows reasons for Non-adherence are multi-factorial with drug side –effects & intentionally skipping medication being major factors.","Jaiswal, Shikha; sharma, Himanshu; Joshi, Usha; Agrawal, Manju; Sheohare, Raka",Indian J Tuberc,89,16

We modelled the pandemic growth using a simple logistic function to derive information of the viral infection and describe the growth of infected and recovered cases. The results indicate that the infected and recovered cases of the first wave were controlled in China and managed in both South America and Africa. There is a negative correlation between both humidity (r = − 0.21; p = 0.27) and temperature (r = −0.22; p = 0.24) with spread of the virus. Though this study did not fully encompass socio-cultural factors, we recognise that local government responses, general health policies, population density and transportation could also affect the spread of the virus. The pandemic can be managed better in the second wave if stricter safety protocols are implemented. We urge various units to collaborate strongly and call on countries to adhere to stronger safety protocols in the second wave.","Babuna, Pius; Han, Chuanliang; Li, Meijia; Gyilbag, Amatus; Dehui, Bian; Awudi, Doris Abra; Supe Tulcan, Roberto Xavier; Yang, Saini; Yang, Xiaohua",Environ Res,89,16

Many of those that suffered from the illness continue to experience symptoms weeks to months following their initial recovery. We assessed patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were discharged from the hospital to an outpatient-based continuous remote patient monitoring (CRPM) program. METHODS: Forty hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia between the ages of 28 and 78 were referred to a designated CRPM team for evaluation and enrollment in a remote monitoring pilot program prior to discharge between the dates of December 2020 and April 2021. Enrolled patients were issued an FDA-approved biophysiologic monitoring device, digital tablet for video teleconferencing, and an in-home Wi-Fi/Mobile Data hub following nursing-led training prior to departing the medical facility. The provided equipment was capable of continuous, near-real time monitoring of SpO2, heart rate, respiration rate, surface/axillary temperature, and mobility data;intermittent data was also collected via a linked automatic blood pressure cuff and portable spirometer. Patients were monitored 24 hours, 7 days per week during their enrollment by dedicated tele-health nursing staff and received serial automated prompts to perform blood pressure assessments and spirometry using the included equipment. Initial and final pulse oximetry and spirometric data was reviewed, consisting of forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC ratio. Patients were disenrolled from the program in the following circumstances: the patient was readmitted to the hospital, the patient chose to disenroll themselves, or the supervising physician determined the patient to be stable for ≥ 72 hours. RESULTS: Forty patients enrolled in the pilot program. Twenty-seven of these patients completed initial and final spirometry and pulse oximetry prior to program discharge. Total days of enrollment were on average 31 ± 25 days. Initial pulse oximetric data returned with a mean of 95 ± 1.6%. Of note, 13 of the 27 patients required supplemental oxygen following hospital discharge. Initial spirometric data for these individuals returned with mean values for FVC (L) of 1.77 ± 0.82, FEV1(L) of 1.22 ± 0.47, and FEV1/FVC of 75 ± 20%. Prior to program disenrollment, mean pulse oximetry was measured at 97 ± 1.9% with only 2 of the 27 patients continuing to require oxygen. Final spirometric data returned with mean values for FVC (L) of 2.61 ± 1.16, FEV1(L) of 1.89 ± 0.72, and FEV1/FVC of 78 ± 19%. CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluated early and late home-tested spirometry and pulse oximetry in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia discharged from the hospital to a CRPM pilot program. Nearly half of the patients (48%) required supplemental oxygen at the time of discharge with only 7.4% requiring oxygen once discharged from the pilot program. Spirometric data indicated an increase of 47.5% in FVC, an increase of 55% for FEV1, an increase of 4.1% in FEV1/FVC between initial and final testing. Correlation with in-lab spirometry testing and percent predicted values will aid in determining the accuracy of the deficits identified on home testing. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This study provides insight into the rate of lung function recovery in hospitalized COVID-19 pneumonia patients, and introduces a novel method to closely monitor recovering patients on an outpatient-basis.

Notably, hRSV infections can give way to pneumonia and predispose to other respiratory complications later in life, such as asthma. Even though the social and economic burden associated with hRSV infections is tremendous, there are no approved vaccines to date to prevent the disease caused by this pathogen. Recently, coinfections and superinfections have turned into an active field of study, and interactions between many viral and bacterial pathogens have been studied. hRSV is not an exception since polymicrobial infections involving this virus are common, especially when illness has evolved into pneumonia. Here, we review the epidemiology and recent findings regarding the main polymicrobial infections involving hRSV and several prevalent bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, human rhinoviruses, influenza A virus, human metapneumovirus, and human parainfluenza viruses. As reports of most polymicrobial infections involving hRSV lack a molecular basis explaining the interaction between hRSV and these pathogens, we believe this review article can serve as a starting point to interesting and very much needed research in this area.","Pacheco, Gaspar A.; Gálvez, Nicolás M.

In Romania, specific challenges were faced with regards to managing the spread and limiting the impact of the disease, ranging from healthcare infrastructure to demographic and sociocultural aspects. As the country has a sizeable diaspora, major difficulties were faced when large numbers of individuals from highly affected areas returned to Romania. However, the fast implementation of control measures successfully averted a surge in the number of COVID-19 cases. This delayed the overburdening of an already challenged healthcare system during the initial phases of the epidemic. Furthermore, early control was facilitated by the exploitation of communication channels that penetrated all layers of society, from ordinary citizens to governmental authorities and high-ranking religious figures. The management of the COVID-19 crisis in Romania illustrates the importance of a fast initial response which takes into account the role played by sociocultural aspects in the context of an epidemic. As the challenges faced by Romania are not unique, these results could inform future public health strategies worldwide.","Dascalu, Stefan",Front Public Health,89,16

METHODS: We included consecutive hospitalized elderly individuals suspected of having pneumonia. At inclusion, NPS were collected from all participants and tested by PCR for the presence of viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens (index test, defined as comprehensive molecular testing). Routine diagnostic tests (blood and sputum culture, urine antigen detection) were also performed. The reference standard was the presence of pneumonia on a low-dose CT scan as assessed by two independent expert radiologists. RESULTS: The diagnosis of pneumonia was confirmed in 127 of 199 (64%) included patients (mean age 83 years, community-acquired pneumonia in 105 (83%)). A pathogen was identified by comprehensive molecular testing in 114 patients (57%) and by routine methods in 22 (11%). Comprehensive molecular testing was positive for viruses in 62 patients (31%) and for bacteria in 73 (37%). The sensitivity and specificity were 61% (95% CI 53%–69%) and 50% (95% CI 39%–61%) for comprehensive molecular testing, and 14% (95% CI 82%–21%) and 94% (95% CI 86%–98%) for routine testing, respectively. Positive likelihood ratio was 2.55 for routine methods and 1.23 for comprehensive molecular testing. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive molecular testing of NPS increases the number of pathogens detected compared with routine methods, but results are poorly predictive of the presence of pneumonia. Hence, comprehensive molecular testing is unlikely to impact clinical decision-making (NCT02467192).

The Ciao Corona study is a longitudinal cohort investigating SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and clustering of cases among around 2500 children from 55 randomly selected primary and secondary schools in the canton of Zurich in Switzerland. Between June 2020 and April 2021, we completed three testing phases where we collected venous blood for serological analysis (ABCORA 2.0 test) and asked about symptoms with online questionnaires. We compared children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in October/November 2020 with those who tested negative. Children who were seronegative in October/November 2020 and seroconverted or were not retested by March/April 2021 were excluded from the analysis (n=256). In March-May 2021 we assessed the presence of symptoms occurring since October 2020, lasting for at least 4 weeks, and persisting for either >4 weeks or >12 weeks. Overall, 1355 of 2503 children with a serology result in October/November 2020 and follow up questionnaire in March/April 2021 were included. Among seropositive and seronegative 6- to 16-year-old children and adolescents, 9% versus 10% reported at least one symptom beyond 4 weeks, and 4% versus 2% at least one symptom beyond 12 weeks. None of the seropositive children reported hospitalization after October 2020. This study suggests a very low prevalence of long COVID in a randomly selected population-based cohort of children followed over 6 months after serological testing. Importantly, seropositive children, all with a history of pauci-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, did not report long COVID more frequently than seronegative children.","Radtke, T.; Ulyte, A.; Puhan, M.

However, the impact of platelets on HIV-1 infection of T cells is unclear. RESULTS: We found that platelets suppress HIV-1 spread in co-cultured T cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Platelets containing granules inhibited HIV-1 spread in T cells more efficiently than degranulated platelets, indicating that the granule content might exert antiviral activity. Indeed, supernatants from activated and thus degranulated platelets suppressed HIV-1 infection. Infection was inhibited at the stage of host cell entry and inhibition was independent of the viral strain or coreceptor tropism. In contrast, blockade of HIV-2 and SIV entry was less efficient. The chemokine CXCL4, a major component of platelet granules, blocked HIV-1 entry and neutralization of CXCL4 in platelet supernatants largely abrogated their anti-HIV-1 activity. CONCLUSIONS: Release of CXCL4 by activated platelets inhibits HIV-1 infection of adjacent T cells at the stage of virus entry. The inhibitory activity of platelet-derived CXCL4 suggests a role of platelets in the defense against infection by HIV-1 and potentially other pathogens.","Solomon Tsegaye, Theodros; Gnirß, Kerstin; Rahe-Meyer, Niels; Kiene, Miriam; Krämer-Kühl, Annika; Behrens, Georg; Münch, Jan; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Retrovirology,89,3

Safety and tolerability were good, with no acute infections or severe deteriorations. Interpretation: Facial and throat pain may correspond to postulated mechanism of action corresponding to activation of innate defences with antiviral effects and may explain the potentially protective effects seen.

Of the app features we tested in our conjoint analysis experiment, only one had statistically significant effects on the self-reported likelihood of downloading the app: decentralized data architecture increased the likelihood by 5.4 percentage points. CONCLUSION: Support for public health surveillance policies to curb the spread of COVID-19 is relatively low in the U.S. Contact tracing apps that use decentralized data storage, compared with those that use centralized data storage, are more accepted by the public. While respondents’ support for expanding traditional contact tracing is greater than their support for the government encouraging the public to download and use contact tracing apps, there are smaller partisan differences in support for the latter policy.","Zhang, Baobao; Kreps, Sarah; McMurry, Nina; McCain, R.

However, most implemented SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance projects were based on qPCR measurement of virus titers and did not address the mutational spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in the population. METHODS: We have implemented a nanopore RNA sequencing monitoring system in the city of Nice (France, 550,000 inhabitants). Between October 2020 and March 2021, we monthly analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 variants in 113 wastewater samples collected in the main wastewater treatment plant and 20 neighborhoods. FINDINGS: We initially detected the lineages predominant in Europe at the end of 2020 (B.1.160, B.1.177, B.1.367, B.1.474, and B.1.221). In January, a localized emergence of a variant (Spike:A522S) of the B.1.1.7 lineage occurred in one neighborhood. It rapidly spread and became dominant all over the city. Other variants of concern (B.1.351, P.1) were also detected in some neighborhoods, but at low frequency. Comparison with individual clinical samples collected during the same week showed that wastewater sequencing correctly identified the same lineages as those found in COVID-19 patients. INTERPRETATION: Wastewater sequencing allowed to document the diversity of SARS-CoV-2 sequences within the different neighborhoods of the city of Nice. Our results illustrate how sequencing of sewage samples can be used to track pathogen sequence diversity in the current pandemics and in future infectious disease outbreaks.

Available research on active surveillance among hospitalized adult patients suffering from SARI in China is limited. This pilot study aimed to identify associated etiologies and describe the demographic, epidemiological and clinical profiles of hospitalized SARI patients aged over 16 years in Jinshan, Shanghai. METHODS: Active surveillance was conducted at 1 sentinel hospital in Jinshan district, Shanghai, from April 2017 to March 2018. Hospitalized SARI patients aged over 16 years old were enrolled, and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected within 24 hours of admission and tested for multiple respiratory viruses (including 18 common viruses) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae with real-time polymerase chain reaction. Demographic, epidemiological and clinical information was obtained from case report forms. RESULTS: In total, 397 SARI patients were enrolled; the median age was 68 years, and 194 (48.9%) patients were male. A total of 278 (70.0%) patients had at least one underlying chronic medical condition. The most frequent symptoms were cough (99.2%) and sputum production (88.4%). The median duration of hospitalization was 10 days. A total of 250 infection patients (63.0%) were positive for at least one pathogen, of whom 198 (49.9%) were positive for a single pathogen and 52 (13.1%) were positive for multiple pathogens. The pathogens identified most frequently were M. pneumoniae (23.9%, 95/397), followed by adenovirus (AdV) (11.6%, 46/397), influenza virus A/H3N2 (Flu A/H3N2) (11.1%, 44/397), human rhinovirus (HRhV) (8.1%, 32/397), influenza virus B/Yamagata (Flu B/Yamagata) (6.3%, 25/397), pandemic influenza virus A/H1N1 (Flu A/pH1N1) (4.0%, 16/397), parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 1 (2.0%, 8/397), human coronavirus (HCoV) type NL63 (2.0%, 8/397), HCoV 229E (1.5%, 6/397), HCoV HKU1 (1.5%, 6/397), PIV 3 (1.5%, 6/397), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (1.5%, 6/397), PIV 4 (1.3%, 5/397), HCoV OC43 (1.0%, 4/397), influenza virus B/Victoria (Flu B/Victoria) (0.5%, 2/397), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) type B (0.5%, 2/397), and human bocavirus (HBoV) (0.3%, 1/397). The seasonality of pathogen-confirmed SARI patients had a bimodal distribution, with the first peak in the summer and the second peak in the winter. Statistically significant differences were observed with respect to the rates of dyspnea, radiographically diagnosed pneumonia and the presence of at least one comorbidity in patients who were infected with only M. pneumoniae, AdV, HRhV, Flu A/H3N2, Flu A /pH1N1 or Flu B/Yamagata. The differences in the positivity rates of the above 6 pathogens among the different age groups were nonsignificant. CONCLUSIONS: M. pneumoniae, AdV and Flu A/H3N2 were the main pathogens detected in hospitalized SARI patients aged over 16 years old in Jinshan district, Shanghai. Our findings highlight the importance of sustained multipathogen surveillance among SARI patients in sentinel hospitals, which can provide useful information on SARI etiologies, epidemiology, and clinical characteristics.","Li, Jian; Song, Can-Lei; Wang, Tang; Ye, Yu-Long; Du, Jian-Ru; Li, Shu-Hua; Zhu, Jian-Min",PLoS One,89,16

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Older adults with ≥1 chronic condition(s) were recruited from 4 active, federally funded studies in Chicago to participate in a longitudinal telephone survey. Participants self-reported stress regarding COVID-19 in the last week. Adherence was measured via the ASK-12 survey. RESULTS: Most participants reported feeling stressed “some of the time” (54.0%), while 18.2% felt stressed “most” or “all of the time” and 27.8% “never” felt stressed. In bivariate analyses, participants who reported being stressed “most” or “all of the time” had worse medication adherence than participants who reported being stressed “some of the time” or “never” (p < 0.001). In multivariable analyses, participants who reported feeling stressed “most” or “all of the time” had worse adherence than those who “never” felt stressed (Adjusted Least Square Mean (Standard Error): 21.3 (0.6) vs 19.7 (0.6), p=0.01). CONCLUSION: Stress due to COVID-19 has significantly impacted medication adherence, which has negative implications for the course of both COVID-19 and comorbid conditions.

We focus on the recent badger culls in the UK, claiming that, based on data provided by the English Government, these culls may be unjustified, all thing considered. We highlight the relevance of ethical reasoning rooted in One Health for this discussion, and make several suggestions including a moratorium on culling until data are provided to support the effectiveness of culling; to conduct a randomized trial to compare proactive culling with alternative methods; to apply deliberative democratic methods to assess public opinion towards the culls, and to find in Brexit an opportunity for aiming for more effective control measures.","Lederman, Zohar; Magalhães-Sant’Ana, Manuel; Voo, Teck Chuan",J Agric Environ Ethics,89,3

Recent studies have emphasized the importance of sphingolipids as signaling molecules in the development and pathogenicity of microbial pathogens including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. In particular, sphingolipids play key roles in regulating the delicate balance between microbes and hosts during microbial pathogenesis. Some pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses, harness host sphingolipids to promote development and infection, whereas sphingolipids from both the host and pathogen are involved in fungus–host interactions. Moreover, a regulatory role for sphingolipids has been described, but their effects on host physiology and metabolism remain to be elucidated. Here, we summarize the current state of knowledge about the roles of sphingolipids in pathogenesis and interactions with host factors, including how sphingolipids modify pathogen and host metabolism with a focus on pathogenesis regulators and relevant metabolic enzymes. In addition, we discuss emerging perspectives on targeting sphingolipids that function in host–microbe interactions as new therapeutic strategies for infectious diseases.","Wang, Jian; Chen, Yi-Li; Li, Yong-Kang; Chen, Ding-Kang; He, Jia-Fan; Yao, Nan",Front Microbiol,89,3

Severity of COVID-19 might be associated with hyperinflammation, thus we aimed at the complete immunoinformatic analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 viroporin E, P0DTC4. We also identified the human proteins interacting with P0DTC4 and the enriched molecular functions of the corresponding genes. The complete sequence of P0DTC4 in FASTA format was processed in 10 databases relative to secondary and tertiary protein structure analyses and prediction of optimal vaccine epitopes. Three more databases were accessed for the retrieval and the molecular functional characterization of the P0DTC4 human interactors. The immunoinformatics analysis resulted in the identification of 4 discontinuous B-cell epitopes along with 1 linear B-cell epitope and 11 T-cell epitopes which were found to be antigenic, immunogenic, nonallergen, nontoxin, and unable to induce autoimmunity thus fulfilling prerequisites for vaccine design. The functional enrichment analysis showed that the predicted host interactors of P0DTC4 target the cellular acetylation network. Two of the identified host-cell proteins – BRD2 and BRD4 – have been shown to be promising targets for antiviral therapy. Thus, our findings have implications for COVID-19 therapy and indicate that viroporin E could serve as a promising vaccine target against SARS-CoV-2.

The current cross-sectional study aimed to assess family routines prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic and examine associations with individual and family well-being. Using a national sample, 300 caregivers of children ages 6-18 were surveyed using Amazon Mechanical Turk platform during the first three months of COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Caregivers reported on family demographics, COVID-19-related stress, engagement in family routines (prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic), stress mindset, self-efficacy, and family resiliency. Overall, families reported engaging in fewer routines during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to prior to the pandemic. COVID-19-related stress was highest in low-income families, families of healthcare workers, and among caregivers who had experienced the COVID-19 virus. Moreover, COVID-19-related stress was negatively related to self-efficacy, positively related to an enhancing stress mindset, and negatively related to family resilience. Engagement in family routines buffered relations between COVID-19-related stress and family resilience, such that COVID-19-related stress was not associated with lower family resilience among families that engaged in high levels of family routines. Results suggest that family routines were challenging to maintain in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, but were associated with better individual and family well-being during this period of acute health, economic, and social stress.","Bates, Carolyn R.; Nicholson, Laura M.; Rea, Elizabeth M.; Hagy, Hannah A.; Bohnert, Amy M.",J Child Fam Stud,89,1

Cattle are the most common mammalian species in which Cryptosporidium is detected, with pre-weaned calves considered to be reservoirs for zoonotic C. parvum. In October 2013, severe diarrhoea was observed in 396 pre-weaned calves at a farm in the Ningxia Autonomous Region of Northwestern China. 356 of the infected calves died despite antibiotic therapy. FINDINGS: 252 faecal samples were collected from the investigated farm. The identity of Cryptosporidium species was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, and by DNA sequence analysis of the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene. C. parvum was subtyped using sequence analysis of the 60 kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene. The highest infection rate of 83.3% (40/48) was seen in 2–3-week-old calves with diarrhoea, corresponding to the age at which animals died. Three Cryptosporidium species were identified, including C. parvum (n = 51), C. bovis (n = 1), and C. ryanae (n = 1). All C. parvum isolates were further identified as subtype IIdA15G1. CONCLUSIONS: Cryptosporidium parvum was likely to be most responsible for diarrhoea and death.

However, the need to develop the economy to sustain the growing human population poses the Climate Commons Dilemma. Although citizens may need to support policies that forgo their country’s economic growth, they may instead be motivated to grow their economy while freeriding on others’ efforts to mitigate the ongoing climate change. To examine how to resolve the climate commons dilemma, we constructed a Climate Commons Game (CCG), an experimental analogue of the climate commons dilemma that embeds a simple model of the effects of economic activities on global temperature rise and its eventual adverse effects on the economy. The game includes multiple economic units, and each participant is tasked to manage one economic unit while keeping global temperature rise to a sustainable level. In two experiments, we show that people can manage the climate system and their economies better when they regarded the goal of environmentally sustainable economic growth as a singular global goal that all economic units collectively pursue rather than a goal to be achieved by each unit individually. In addition, beliefs that everyone shares the knowledge about the climate system help the group coordinate their economic activities better to mitigate global warming in the CCG. However, we also found that the resolution of the climate commons dilemma came at the cost of exacerbating inequality among the economic units in the current constrains of the CCG.

While previous studies investigating determinants of health system efficiency focused primarily on economic and social influence factors, the role of the political regime has been neglected. In addition, there is a lack of formal theoretical work on this specific topic, which ensures transparency and logical consistency of arguments and implications. Using a public choice approach, this paper provides a rigorous theoretical and empirical investigation of the relationships between health system efficiency and political institutions. We develop a simple principal-agent model describing the behavior of a government with respect to investments in population health under different political regimes. The main implication of the theoretical model is that governments under more democratic regimes put more effort in reducing embezzlement of health expenditure than non-democratic regimes. Accordingly, democratic countries are predicted to have more efficient health systems than non-democratic countries. We test this hypothesis based on a broad dataset including 158 countries over the period 1995-2015. The empirical results clearly support the implications of the theoretical model and withstand several robustness checks, including the use of alternative indicators for population health and democracy and estimations accounting for endogeneity. The empirical results also indicate that the effect of democracy on health system efficiency is more pronounced in countries with higher income levels. From a policy perspective, we discuss the implications of our findings in the context of health development assistance.","Roessler, Martin; Schmitt, Jochen",PLoS One,89,29

The aim of this study was to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) specifically designed to detect FCoV spike gene mutations at two nucleotide positions. It was hypothesized that this test would correctly discriminate feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). METHODS: The study included 63 cats with signs consistent with FIP. FIP was confirmed in 38 cats. Twenty-five control cats were definitively diagnosed with a disease other than FIP. Effusion and/or serum/plasma samples were examined by real-time RT-PCR targeting the two FCoV spike gene fusion peptide mutations M1058 L and S1060A using an allelic discrimination approach. Sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values including 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. RESULTS: FIPV was detected in the effusion of 25/59 cats, one of them being a control cat with chronic kidney disease. A mixed population of FIPV/FECV was detected in the effusion of 2/59 cats; all of them had FIP. RT-PCR was negative or the pathotype could not be determined in 34/59 effusion samples.

Vaccine safety concerns might nevertheless outweigh the perceived disease risks when an individual decides whether or not to accept the vaccine. We investigated the role of perceived risk of COVID-19 (i.e., perceived likelihood of infection, perceived disease severity, and disease-related worry) and perceived safety of a prospective vaccine against COVID-19 in predicting intentions to accept a COVID-19 vaccine. Three Finnish samples were surveyed: 825 parents of small children, 205 individuals living in an area with suboptimal vaccination coverage, and 1325 Facebook users nationwide. As points of reference, we compared the perceptions of COVID-19 to those of influenza and measles. COVID-19 was perceived as a threatening disease—more so than influenza and measles. The strongest predictor of COVID-19 vaccination intentions was trusting the safety of the potential vaccine. Those perceiving COVID-19 as a severe disease were also slightly more intent on taking a COVID-19 vaccine. Informing the public about the safety of a forthcoming COVID-19 vaccine should be the focus for health authorities aiming to achieve a high vaccine uptake.","Karlsson, Linda C.; Soveri, Anna; Lewandowsky, Stephan; Karlsson, Linnea; Karlsson, Hasse; Nolvi, Saara; Karukivi, Max; Lindfelt, Mikael; Antfolk, Jan",Pers Individ Dif,89,28

Sars Cov-2 - ACE2 binding leads to a RAS mediated immune response, which targets especially lungs to form ARDS, which in turn, is the most important cause of mortality in COVID-19. CD8(+) T cell response dominates over CD4(+) T cell response and natural killer cell dysfunction also leads to CD4(+) cell dysfunction in COVID-19; this immune dysregulation leads to inappropriate (ARDS) and inadequate (low or quickly waning antibodies) responses to the disease and unfortunately, prepares the patients for re-infections. The peripheral anergy seen in chronic sarcoidosis has much resemblance to COVID-19; CD8(+) T cell accumulation is also responsible for inadequate reaction to tuberculin and antigenic stimulus. This article, based on the similarity of COVID-19 and sarcoidosis, discusses a combination of the therapeutic strategy of the tetanus-diphtheria vaccine and dual RAS inhibition, alongside with hydroxychloroquine and antiviral agents, as a solution to overcome the problems described above.","Ozbalci, Demircan",Med Hypotheses,89,17

There is a growing need to discuss the elements of a coordinated strategy to control the spread and mitigate the severity of COVID-19. H1N1 and Streptococcus pneumonia vaccines are available. The current analysis was performed to analyze the severity of COVID-19 and influenza (H1N1) vaccination in adults ≥ 65. Also, to correlate the lower respiratory tract infections (LRIs), and influenza attributable to the lower respiratory tract infections' incidence with Covid-19 mortality. Evolutionarily influenza is close in resemblance to SARS-CoV-2 viruses and shares some common epitopes and mechanisms. Methods: Recent influenza vaccination data of 34 countries from OECD and other publications were correlated with COVID-19 mortality from worldometer data. LRIs attributable to influenza and streptococcus pneumonia were correlated with COVID-19 mortality. Specifically, influenza-attributable LRI incidence data of various countries (n = 182) was correlated with COVID-19 death by linear regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyzes. In a logistic regression model, population density and influenza LRI incidence were correlated with COVID-19 mortality. Results: There is a correlation between COVID-19-related mortality, morbidity, and case incidence and the status of influenza vaccination, which appears protective. The tendency of correlation is increasingly highlighted as the pandemic is evolving. In countries where influenza immunization is less common, there is a correlation between LRIs and influenza attributable to LRI incidence and COVID-19 severity, which is beneficial. ROC curve showed an area under the curve of 0.86 (CI 0.78 to 0.944, P < 0.0001) to predict COVID-19 mortality >150/million and a decreasing trend of influenza LRI episodes. To predict COVID-19 mortality of >200/million population, the odds ratio for influenza incidence/100,000 was −1.86 (CI −2.75 to −0.96, P < 0.0001). To predict the parameter Covid-19 mortality/influenza LRI episodes(*)1000>1000, the influenza parameter had an odd's ratio of −3.83 (CI −5.98 to −1.67), and an AUC of 0.94. Conclusion: Influenza (H1N1) vaccination can be used as an interim measure to mitigate the severity of COVID-19 in the general population. In appropriate high-risk circumstances, Streptococcus pneumonia vaccination would also be an adjunct strategy, especially in countries with a lower incidence of LRIs.","Arokiaraj, Mark Christopher",Front Public Health,89,10

The initial step of the infection involves the binding of the virus through the viral spike protein with the host angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In this study, the interaction of some ACE or ACE2 inhibitors and their analogues as well as selected compounds with the viral spike protein as a strategy to hinder viral-ACE2 interaction were investigated. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as well as the ligands were retrieved from protein databank and ChEBI database respectively. The molecules were prepared before initiating the virtual screening using PyRx software. Discovery studio was used to further visualize the binding interactions between the compounds and the protein. RESULTS: The ACE inhibitors and their analogues fosinopril (1-), fosinopril and moexipril have the best binding affinity to the protein with binding energies < − 7.0 kcal/mol while non-flavonoid stilben-4-ol binds with free binding energy of − 7.1 kcal/mol. Others compounds which belong to either the flavonoids, terpenes and alkaloid classes also have binding energies < − 7.0 kcal/mol. Such high binding energies were enhanced via hydrogen bond (h-bond) interactions in addition to other interactions observed between the compounds and the amino acid residues of the protein. CONCLUSIONS: The ACE inhibitors and their analogues as well as the selected compounds could serve as inhibitors of the spike protein as well as lead in drug discovery processes to target the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Aminu, Suleiman; Ibrahim, Mohammed Auwal; Sallau, Abdullahi Balarabe",Beni Suef Univ J Basic Appl Sci,89,20

Considering CoVs as RNA viruses with a single-stranded RNA genome (+ssRNA), the critical viral enzyme RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is a promising therapeutic target for the potentially fatal infection COVID-19. Nicotinamide riboside (NR), which is a naturally occurring analogue of Niacin (vitamin B3), is expected to have therapeutic effects on COVID-19 due to its super close structural similarity to the proven RdRp inhibitors. Thus, at the first phase of the current molecular docking and dynamics simulation studies, we targeted SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. On the next phase, SARS-CoV RdRp, human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, Inosine-5’-monophosphate dehydrogenase, and the SARS-CoV-2 Structural Glycoproteins Spike, Nonstructural viral protein 3-Chymotrypsin-like protease, and Papain-like protease were targeted using the docking simulation to find other possible antiviral effects of NR serendipitously. In the current study, the resulted scores from molecular docking and dynamics simulations as the primary determinative factor as well as the observed reliable binding modes have demonstrated that Nicotinamide Riboside and its active metabolite NMN can target human ACE2 and IMPDH, along with the viral S(pro), M(pro), PL(pro), and on top of all, RdRp as a potential competitive inhibitor.","Esam, Zohreh; Akhavan, Malihe; lotfi, Maryam; Bekhradnia, Ahmadreza",J Mol Struct,89,20

In many countries, the health systems collapsed and healthcare professionals had to be on the front line of this crisis. The adverse effects on the mental health of healthcare professionals have been widely reported. This research focuses on identifying the main factors associated with adverse psychological outcomes. Methods Descriptive, cross-sectional study based on surveys, applying the PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI and EIE-R tests to healthcare professionals from Ecuador during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results 1,028 participants, distributed in: 557 physicians (54.18%), 349 nurses (33.94%), 29 laboratory workers (2.82%), 27 paramedics (2.62%), 52 psychologists (5.05%) and 14 respiratory therapists (1.36%), from 16 of the 24 provinces of Ecuador. Of these, 27.3% presented symptoms of depression, 39.2% anxiety symptoms, 16.3% insomnia and 43.8% symptoms of PTSD, with the 4 types of symptoms ranging from moderate to severe. The most relevant associated factors were: working in Guayas (the most affected province) (OR = 2.18 for depressive symptoms and OR = 2.59 for PTSD symptoms); being a postgraduate doctor (OR = 1.52 for depressive symptoms and OR = 1.57 for insomnia), perception of not having the proper protective equipment (OR = 1.71 for symptoms of depression and OR = 1.57 for symptoms of anxiety) and being a woman (OR = 1.39 for anxiety). Conclusions Healthcare professionals can suffer a significant mental condition that may require psychiatric and psychological intervention. The main associated factors are primarily related to living and working in cities with a higher number of cases and the characteristics of the job, such as being a postgraduate doctor, as well as the perception of security. The main risk factors are primarily related to geographical distribution and job characteristics, such as being a resident physician and self-perception of safety. Further studies are required as the pandemic evolves.","Pazmiño Erazo, Edgar Efraín; Alvear Velásquez, María José; Saltos Chávez, Ivonne Gisselle; Pazmiño Pullas, David Emanuel",Rev Colomb Psiquiatr (Engl Ed),89,20

The conformation of the spike protein can be either open or closed, yet it is unclear how the conformations affect the protein’s functions or what regulate the conformational changes. Using SARS-CoV-1 and bat RaTG13-CoV as comparisons, we identified two molecular switches that regulate the conformations of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein: (i) a furin motif loop turns SARS-CoV-2 spike from a closed conformation to a mixture of open and closed conformations, and (ii) a K417V mutation turns SARS-CoV-2 spike from mixed conformations to an open conformation. We showed that the open conformation favors viral potency by exposing the RBD for receptor binding and viral entry, whereas the closed conformation supports viral immune evasion by hiding the RBD from neutralizing antibodies. Hence SARS-CoV-2 spike has evolved to reach a balance between potency and immune evasiveness, which may contribute to the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2. The dynamics between viral potency and invasiveness is likely to further evolve, providing insights into future evolution of SARS-CoV-2.","Wan, Yushun; Huang, Linfen; Zhang, Xiujuan; Shang, Jian; Perlman, Stanley; Du, Lanying; Li, Fang",Res Sq,89,24

Because children were first identified as potential spreaders of the virus, schools were closed in several countries. However, it rapidly became evident that the number of hospitalized children infected by SARS-CoV-2 was dramatically lower than that of adults. To date, only hypotheses have been raised to explain this difference, so it is of great importance to describe the presentation of this disease among children. Here, we describe a wide spectrum of COVID-19 manifestation in children in a dedicated pediatric unit in France. Methods: Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who were diagnosed on the basis of either positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs and/or typical aspects in chest-computed tomography (CT) were included between March and May 2020 in Paris. Results: Twenty-three patients were included on the basis of positive RT-PCR (n = 20) and/or typical aspects in CT (n = 4). The median age was 4.9 years [0.1–17.6]. Patients were grouped by age (<2 years old: n = 14, 61%; 2–10 years old: n = 2, 9%; >10 years old: n = 7, 30%). Overweight or obesity was reported in only three patients. At presentation, the most frequent symptom in the overall cohort was fever (n = 18, 78%), followed by acute rhinitis (n = 9, 64%) and cough (n = 7, 50%) in the under 2-year-old group and cough (n = 4, 57%), fatigue, dyspnea and abdominal pain (n = 3, 43% each) in the over 10-year-old group. Five patients required ICU treatment, four of whom were aged >10 years, two presented with acute myocarditis, and two were sickle cell disease patients who presented with acute chest syndrome. Discussion and conclusion: The youngest patients seem to present milder forms of COVID-19 without the need for ICU treatment and with a shorter length of hospitalization. More severe evolutions were observed in teenagers, with, however, favorable outcomes. Given the context of closed schools and confinement, the infection of these children suggests intra-familial transmission that needs to be further assessed. This description might help to understand the intriguing differences in COVID-19 severity across age-classes.","Nathan, Nadia; Prevost, Blandine; Sileo, Chiara; Richard, Nicolas; Berdah, Laura; Thouvenin, Guillaume; Aubertin, Guillaume; Lecarpentier, Thibault; Schnuriger, Aurélie; Jegard, Julien; Guellec, Isabelle; Taytard, Jessica; Corvol, Harriet",J Clin Med,89,29

After laparoscopic appendectomy, histopathology of the appendix demonstrated only mild serosal inflammation and was not consistent with acute appendicitis. Her overall clinical presentation was felt to be consistent with MIS-C and she subsequently improved with immunomodulatory and steroid treatment. CONCLUSIONS: We note that MIS-C can mimic acute appendicitis. This case highlights MIS-C as a cause of abdominal imaging with features concerning for appendicitis, and MIS-C should be considered in the differential for a patient with appendicitis-like symptoms and a positive COVID-19 IgG. Lab criteria, specifically low-normal white blood cell count and thrombocytopenia, appears to be of high relevance in differing MIS-C from acute appendicitis, even when appendix radiologically is dilated.","Hwang, Michelle; Wilson, Kelsey; Wendt, Lisa; Pohlman, Joshua; Densmore, Emily; Kaeppler, Caitlin; Van Arendonk, Kyle; Yale, Sarah",BMC Pediatr,89,24

We examine the mechanisms through which the government’s policies have led to changes in people’s behavior. Using smartphone location data, we construct a daily prefecture-level stay-at-home measure to identify the following two effects: (1) the effect that citizens refrained from going out in line with the government’s request, and (2) the effect that government announcements reinforced awareness with regard to the seriousness of the pandemic and people voluntarily refrained from going out. Our main findings are as follows. First, the declaration of the state of emergency reduced the number of people leaving their homes by 8.5% through the first channel, which is of the same order of magnitude as the estimates obtained for lockdowns in the United States. Second, a 1% increase in new infections in a prefecture reduces people’s outings in that prefecture by 0.027%. Third, the government’s requests are responsible for about one quarter of the decrease in outings in Tokyo, while the remaining three quarters are the result of citizens obtaining new information through government announcements and the daily release of the number of infections. The findings suggest that what mattered for containing the spread of COVID-19 was not strong, legally binding measures but the provision of appropriate information that encouraged people to change their behavior.","Watanabe, Tsutomu; Yabu, Tomoyoshi",PLoS One,89,24

Kuwait reported its first cases of COVID-19 on February 24th 2020 and since then the number of cases has been increasing rapidly. Methods and Findings: This is a retrospective single-center study of consecutive 417 COVID-19 patients admitted to Jaber Al-Ahmad hospital between 24/2/2020 and 24/5/2020. The mean age of cohort was 45.35 years (S.D. 17.16) and 62.8% of cases were males. Patients were divided into four groups; Asymptomatic group, symptomatic group with mild form of the disease, ICU survivors and ICU death. In total, 39.3% of patients were asymptomatic, 41% were symptomatic with mild symptoms, 5.3% were admitted to ICU and recovered and 14.4% died. Mean age of ICU patients was 53.61 years (S.D. 13.43). Comorbidities were more prevalent in ICU death group when compared to other groups (p<0.05) including Diabetes (40%), Hypertension (46.7%), Asthma (20.3%) and cardiovascular disease (21.7%). Blood biochemistry analysis showed that ICU death group had a characteristic abnormal pattern of certain markers upon admission in the ICU. Including significantly high WBC and neutrophil counts (P<0.05) and prolonged Prothrombin Time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) (P<0.05). D-dimer, C-reactive protein and Procalcitonin (PCT) showed significantly high levels in ICU admissions and in ICU death group in particular (P<0.05). Kidney injury complications were reported in 65% of ICU death group (P<0.05) which also showed significantly elevated urea levels (P<0.05). We also reported rapid deteriorating kidney function (eGFR) in ICU death cases during ICU stay until the outcome was reached. Conclusions: In this single-center study of 417 COVID19 patients in Kuwait. The disease showed varying degree of severity ranging from asymptomatic status to death. Our comprehensive laboratory analysis revealed distinct abnormal patterns of markers that are associated with poor prognosis. Our dynamic profiling of eGFR in COVID-19 ICU patients highlight potential role of renal markers in forecasting disease outcome and perhaps identify patients at risk of poor outcome.","Alshukry, A.; Ali, H.; Ali, Y.; Al Taweel, T.; Abu-farha, M.; AbuBaker, J.; Devarajan, S.; Dashti, A.

Several observational trans-omics analyses associated carbon and amino acid metabolism in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity in patients but lacked mechanistic insights. In this study, using patient- derived multi-omics data and in vitro infection assays, we aimed to understand i) role of key metabolic pathways in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) reproduction and ii) its association with disease severity. Our data suggests that monocytes are key to the altered immune response during COVID-19. COVID-19 infection was associated with increased plasma glutamate levels, while glucose and mannose levels were determinants of the disease severity. Monocytes showed altered expression pattern of carbohydrate and amino acid transporters, GLUT1 and xCT respectively in severe COVID-19. Furthermore, lung epithelial cells (Calu-3) showed a strong acute metabolic adaptation following infection in vitro by modulating central carbon metabolism. We found that glycolysis and glutaminolysis are essential for virus replication and blocking these metabolic pathways caused significant reduction in virus production. Taken together, our study highlights that the virus utilizes and re-wires pathways governing central carbon metabolism leading to metabolic toxicity. Thus, the host metabolic perturbation could be an attractive strategy to limit the viral replication and disease severity.","Krishnan, Shuba; Nordqvist, Hampus; Ambikan, Anoop T.; Gupta, Soham; Sperk, Maike; Svensson-Akusjärvi, Sara; Mikaeloff, Flora; Benfeitas, Rui; Saccon, Elisa; Ponnan, Sivasankaran Munusamy; Rodriguez, Jimmy Esneider; Nikouyan, Negin; Odeh, Amani; Ahlén, Gustaf; Asghar, Muhammad; Sällberg, Matti; Vesterbacka, Jan; Nowak, Piotr; Végvári, Ákos; Sönnerborg, Anders; Treutiger, Carl Johan; Neogi, Ujjwal",bioRxiv,89,9

SARS coronaviruses have been detected in wastewater during outbreaks in China, Europe, and the United States. In this perspective, we outline the risk fecal shedding poses at locations without safely managed sanitation, as in most of Nigeria where we work. We believe that feco-oral transmission could occur if community transmission becomes high and sustained in densely populated cities without proper sanitation in Nigeria and many other African and Asian settings. In the absence of basic sanitation, or where existing sanitation is not safely managed, groundwater, which is often drawn up from wells and boreholes for drinking and household use, can become contaminated with enteric bacteria and viruses from fecal matter. Endemic and epidemic transmission of multiple feco-oral pathogens via this route continues to be documented in areas without safely managed sanitation, and, therefore, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission needs to be evaluated, tracked, and forestalled in such settings. We suggest that fecal matter from treatment facilities and recovered patients should be carefully and properly disposed. Furthermore, environmental surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and accumulated human waste, as well as efforts to mitigate the virus’ entry into unprotected household water sources, should be a priority part of the COVID-19 response in settings without safely managed sanitation for the duration of the pandemic.","Odih, Erkison E.; Afolayan, Ayorinde O.; Akintayo, IfeOluwa; Okeke, Iruka N.",Am J Trop Med Hyg,89,1

The primary objective of this study was to determine if the implementation of a designated COVID-19 cohort area (hot zone) within a busy ED mitigated the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 throughout the rest of the department. METHODS: In an ED of a tertiary academic medical center, with 64,000 annual visits, an eight room pod was designated for known COVID-19 or individuals with high suspicion for infection. There was a single entry and exit for donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE). Health care workers (HCW) changed gowns and gloves between patients, but maintained their N-95 mask and face shield, cleaning the shield with a germicidal wipe between patients. Staffing assignments designated nurses and technicians to remain in this area for 4 h, where physicians regularly moved between the hot zone and rest of the ED. Fifteen surface samples and four air samples were taken to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 contamination levels and the effectiveness of infection control practices. Samples were collected outside of patient rooms in 3 primary ED patient care areas, the reception area, the primary nurses station, inside the cohort area, and the PPE donning and doffing areas immediately adjacent. Samples were recovered and analyzed for the presence of the E gene of SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was not detected on any surface samples, including in and around the cohort area. All air samples outside the COVID-19 hot zone were negative for SARS-CoV-2, but air samples within the cohort area had a low level of viral contamination. CONCLUSION: A designated COVID-19 cohort area resulted in no air or surface contamination outside of the hot zone, and only minimal air, but no surface contamination, within the hot zone.","Barksdale, Aaron Nathan; Zeger, Wesley G.; Santarpia, Joshua L.; Herrera, Vicki L.; Ackerman, Daniel N.; Lowe, John J.; Wadman, Michael C.",Am J Emerg Med,89,27

Design: Cross-sectional e-survey study. Setting: African countries Participants: Cardiologists Primary and Secondary outcomes measures: The primary outcome was the change in service delivery in African cardiology units during the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary outcomes were the satisfaction of cardiologists with regards to the workload and factors associated with this satisfaction. Results: There was a significant reduction in working time and the number of patients consulted by week during this pandemic (p<0.001). In general, there was a decrease in the overall activities in cardiovascular care delivery. The majority of cardiology services (76.5%) and consulting programs (85%) were adjusted to the pandemic. Only half of the participants were satisfied with their workload. Reconfiguration of the consultation schedule was associated with a reduced satisfaction of participants (p=0.02). Conclusions: COVID-19 is associated with an overall reduction in cardiology services rendered in Africa. Since the cardiovascular burdens continue to increase in this part of the World and the risk of cardiovascular complications linked to SARS COV2 remains unchanged cardiology, departments in Africa should anticipate a significant surge of cardiology services demanded by patients after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Nganou-Gnindjio, C.

DESIGN: Community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods including focus group discussions, interviews, and surveys were conducted with Somali community members and expert advisors to design the educational content. Co-design approaches with community input were employed in a phased approach to develop the VR storyline. PARTICIPANTS: 60 adult Somali refugees and seven expert advisors who specialise in healthcare, autism research, technology development and community engagement. SETTING: Somali refugees participated at the offices of a community-based organisation, Somali Family Service, in San Diego, California and online. Expert advisors responded to surveys virtually. RESULTS: We find that a CBPR approach can be effectively used for the co-design of a VR educational programme. Additionally, cultural and linguistic sensitivities can be incorporated within a VR educational programme and are essential factors for effective community engagement. Finally, effective VR utilisation requires flexibility so that it can be used among community members with varying levels of health and technology literacy. CONCLUSION: We describe using community co-design to create a culturally and linguistically sensitive VR experience promoting vaccination within a refugee community. Our approach to VR development incorporated community members at each step of the process.

At the first, seventeen potent linear B-cell and T-cell binding epitopes from surface glycoprotein were predicted in silico, then the epitopes were joined together via different linkers. The ability of the selected epitopes to induce interferon-gamma was evaluate using IFNepitope web server. One final vaccine was constructed which composed of 398 amino acids and attached to 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12 as adjuvant. Physicochemical properties, as well as antigenicity in the proposed vaccines, were checked for defining the vaccine stability and its ability to induce cell-mediated immune responses. Three-dimensional structure of the mentioned vaccine was subjected to the molecular docking studies with MHC-I and MHC-II molecules.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying epithelial cell polarity establishment remain elusive. Here, we show that septin cytoskeleton interacts with catenin complex to organize a functional domain to separate apical from basal membranes in polarized epithelial cells. Using polarized epithelial cell monolayer as a model system with transepithelial electrical resistance as functional readout, our studies show that septins are essential for epithelial cell polarization. Our proteomic analyses discovered a novel septin‒catenin complex during epithelial cell polarization. The functional relevance of septin‒catenin complex was then examined in three-dimensional (3D) culture in which suppression of septins resulted in deformation of apical lumen in cysts, a hallmark seen in polarity-deficient 3D cultures and animals. Mechanistically, septin cytoskeleton stabilizes the association of adherens catenin complex with actin cytoskeleton, and depletion or disruption of septin cytoskeleton liberates adherens junction and polarity complexes into the cytoplasm. Together, these findings reveal a previously unrecognized role for septin cytoskeleton in the polarization of the apical‒basal axis and lumen formation in polarized epithelial cells.","Wang, Xueying; Wang, Wenwen; Wang, Xiwei; Wang, Ming; Zhu, Lijuan; Garba, Fatima; Fu, Chuanhai; Zieger, Barbara; Liu, Xu; Liu, Xing; Yao, Xuebiao",J Mol Cell Biol,89,16

PRRSV nonstructural protein (nsp) 1β was identified as the nuclear protein playing the role for host mRNA nuclear retention and subversion of host protein synthesis. A SAP (SAF-A/B, Acinus, and PIAS) motif was identified in nsp1β with the consensus sequence of (126)-LQxxLxxxGL-(135). In situ hybridization unveiled that SAP mutants were unable to cause nuclear retention of host cell mRNAs and did not suppress host protein synthesis. In addition, these SAP mutants reverted PRRSV-nsp1β-mediated suppression of interferon (IFN) production, IFN signaling, and TNF-α production pathway. Using reverse genetics, a series of SAP mutant PRRS viruses, vK124A, vL126A, vG134A, and vL135A were generated. No mRNA nuclear retention was observed during vL126A and vL135A infections. Importantly, vL126A and vL135A did not suppress IFN production. For other arteriviruses, mRNA nuclear accumulation was also observed for LDV-nsp1β and SHFV-nsp1β.

This virus is a new isolate of coronavirus, and the current infection crisis has surpassed the SARS and MERS epidemics that occurred in 2002 and 2013, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 has currently infected more than 142,000 people, causing 5,000 deaths and spreading across more than 130 countries worldwide. The spreading capacity of the virus clearly demonstrates the potential threat of respiratory viruses to human health, thereby reiterating to the governments around the world that preventive health policies and scientific research are pivotal to overcoming the crisis. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) causes flu-like symptoms in most cases. However, approximately 15% of the patients need hospitalization, and 5% require assisted ventilation, depending on the cohorts studied. What is intriguing, however, is the higher susceptibility of the elderly, especially individuals who are older than 60 years of age, and have comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease. In fact, the death rate in this group may be up to 10-12%. Interestingly, children are somehow less susceptible and are not considered as a risk group. Therefore, in this review, we discuss some possible molecular and cellular mechanisms by virtue of which the elderly subjects may be more susceptible to severe COVID-19. Toward this, we raise two main points, i) increased ACE-2 expression in pulmonary and heart tissues in users of chronic angiotensin 1 receptor (AT1R) blockers; and ii) antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) after previous exposure to other circulating coronaviruses. We believe that these points are pivotal for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19, and must be carefully addressed by physicians and scientists in the field.","Peron, Jean Pierre Schatzmann; Nakaya, Helder",Clinics (Sao Paulo),89,1

Clinical characteristics regarding secondary infections in patients with COVID-19 have been reported but detailed microbiology, risk factors and outcomes of secondary bloodstream infections (sBSI) in patients with severe COVID-19 have not been well described. METHODS: We performed a multicenter, case-control study including all hospitalized patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19 and blood cultures drawn from March 1, 2020 to May 7, 2020 at three academic medical centers in New Jersey, USA. Data collection included demographics, clinical and microbiologic variables, and patient outcomes. Risk factors and outcomes were compared between cases (sBSI) and controls (no sBSI). RESULTS: A total of 375 hospitalized patients were included. There were 128 sBSIs during the hospitalization. For the first set of positive blood cultures, 117 (91.4%) were bacterial and 7 (5.5%) were fungal. Those with sBSI were more likely to have altered mental status, lower mean percent oxygen saturation on room air, have septic shock and be admitted to the intensive care unit compared to the controls. In-hospital mortality was higher in those with a sBSI versus controls (53.1% vs 32.8%, p=0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: We observed hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19 and sBSI had a more severe initial presentation, prolonged hospital course, and worse clinical outcomes. To maintain antimicrobial stewardship principles, further prospective studies are necessary to better characterize risk factors and prediction modeling to better understand when to suspect and empirically treat for sBSI in severe COVID-19.","Bhatt, Pinki J; Shiau, Stephanie; Brunetti, Luigi; Xie, Yingda; Solanki, Kinjal; Khalid, Shaza; Mohayya, Sana; Au, Pak Ho; Pham, Christopher; Uprety, Priyanka; Nahass, Ronald; Narayanan, Navaneeth",Clin Infect Dis,89,16

We evaluated the Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device for COVID-19 diagnosis in symptomatic patients (n=412) attended in primary healthcare centers. METHODS: RAD was performed immediately after sampling following the manufacturer’s instructions (reading at 15 min.). RT-PCRs were carried out within 24 h. of specimen collection. Samples displaying discordant results were processed for culture in Vero E6 cells. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 in cell cultures was confirmed by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Out of 412 patients, 43 (10.4%) tested positive by RT-PCR and RAD and 358 (86.9%) negative by both methods, showing discordant results (RT-PCR+/RAD-) in 11 patients (2.7%). Overall specificity and sensitivity of rapid antigen detection (RAD) was 100% (95% CI, 98.7-100%), and 79.6% (95% CI, 67.-88.8%), respectively, taking RT-PCR as the reference. Overall RAD negative predictive value for an estimated prevalence of 5% and 10% was 99% (95% CI, 97.4-99.6%) and 97.9% (95% CI, 95.9-98.9), respectively. SARS-CoV-2 could not be cultured from specimens yielding RT-PCR+/RAD-results (n=11). CONCLUSION: The Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device performed well as a POCT for early diagnosis of COVID-19 in primary healthcare centers.

METHODS: We conducted a multi-stage sampling, cross-sectional survey using self-administered anonymous questionnaires from May to June, in 2014. The main outcome variable was residents’ willingness to accept a future H7N9 vaccine. Logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of vaccination willingness. RESULTS: Of the 7264 eligible participants, 14.5% of Beijing residents reported that they had not heard of H7N9. Among those who had heard of H7N9, 59.5% of the general adult population would be willing to accept a future H7N9 vaccine, and approximately half of them reported ‘I am afraid of being infected by H7N9’ and ‘H7N9 vaccine can prevent infections’, and 28.1% reported ‘my daily life is affected by H7N9’. The variables that were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of reporting willingness were being younger adults (aged 18–29 years: OR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.17–1.97; aged 30–39 years: OR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.08–1.78), being farmers (OR = 1.61; 95% CI: 1.32–1.96), being unemployed people (OR = 1.36; 95% CI: 1.04–1.78), living in suburban areas (OR = 2.18; 95% CI: 1.89–2.51), having ≥2 children in the family (OR = 1.41; 95% CI: 1.03–1.92), perceived risk in China (OR = 1.30; 95% CI: 1.15–1.48), perceived susceptibility to disease (OR = 3.13; 95% CI: 2.73–3.58), perceived negative effect on daily life (OR = 1.32; 95% CI: 1.13–1.55), perceived effectiveness of vaccination (OR = 2.34; 95% CI: 2.07–2.64), and recent uptake of influenza vaccine (OR = 2.26; 95% CI: 1.92–2.66). CONCLUSIONS: A great number of Beijing residents had doubts about the vaccine’s effectiveness and were not concerned about disease risk, which were the factors affecting willingness to be vaccinated. Targeted education programs on disease risk as well as vaccine’s effectiveness are needed to improve the willingness of vaccination for potential H7N9 pandemic preparedness.","Wu, Shuangsheng; Su, Jianting; Yang, Peng; Zhang, Haiyan; Li, Hongjun; Chu, Yanhui; Hua, Weiyu; Li, Chao; Tang, Yaqing; Wang, Quanyi",Vaccine,89,22

There is increasing focus on promotion of wellness in survivorship and active approaches to reducing morbidity related to treatment; however, current models of follow-up care are heavily reliant on hospital-based specialist-led care. This study aims to test the feasibility of the EMINENT intervention for implementing an integrated, shared-care model involving both cancer centre specialists and community-based general practitioners for early breast cancer post-treatment follow-up. METHODS: We describe a protocol for a phase II, randomised controlled trial with two parallel arms and 1:1 allocation. A total of 60 patients with early-stage breast cancer will be randomised to usual, specialist-led, follow-up care (as determined by the treating surgeons, medical oncologists, and radiation oncologists) or shared follow-up care intervention (i.e. EMINENT). EMINENT is a nurse-enabled, pre-specified shared-care pathway with follow-up responsibilities divided between cancer centre specialists (i.e. surgeons and oncologists) and general practitioners. The primary outcome is health-related quality of life as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy—Breast Cancer. Secondary outcomes include patient experience, acceptance, and satisfaction of care; dietary, physical activity, and sedentary behaviours; financial toxicity; adherence; health resource utilisation; and adverse events. DISCUSSION: The trial is designed to identify the barriers to implementing a shared-care model for breast cancer survivors following treatment. Results of this study will inform a definitive trial testing the effects of shared-care model on health-related quality of life of breast cancer survivors, as well as its ability to alleviate the growing demands on the healthcare system.

In this study, we sought to determine the extent of neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 in a prospective series of unselected patients admitted to the general medicine wards of our hospitals due to COVID-19 and who were examined by a team of neurologists. Methods Eight neurologists provided medical attention to patients hospitalized for COVID-19 to provide medical support to other hospital units tasked with the care of an increasingly larger influx of patients with COVID-19. A series of 100 consecutive, unselected patients were evaluated systematically, including a questionnaire that collected medical information derived from the initial examination and the medical history. Results Eighty-eight percent of the patients had 1 neurologic manifestation associated with COVID-19 during hospitalization. Most common were anosmia-dysgeusia and headache (44% each), myalgias (43%), and dizziness (36%). Less frequent were encephalopathy (8%), syncope (7%), seizures (2%), and ischemic stroke during the period of hospitalization (2%). Anosmia and headache associated with younger patients with less severe disease, and both were associated with each other and with serum inflammatory markers. Encephalopathy was associated with fever and syncope and with markers of inflammation. Conclusions Neurologic disturbances are common in patients with COVID-19, particularly if patients are evaluated by neurologists. There is a wide variety of neurologic conditions, some of them severe, in the spectrum of COVID-19 disease that will benefit from an evaluation by practicing neurologists.","García-Moncó, Juan Carlos; Cabrera Muras, Antonio; Erburu Iriarte, Markel; Rodrigo Armenteros, Patricia; Collía Fernández, Alejandra; Arranz-Martínez, Javier; Kapetanovic, Solange; Lorenzo-García, Ana; Bilbao González, Amaia; Gomez-Beldarrain, Marian",Neurology.

However, things have not turned out that way, due to both the continual progress witnessed in plasma fractionation and viral-reduction technologies and technical difficulties still being encountered in developing more cost-effective non-immunogenic, fully active recombinant therapeutic proteins. Accordingly, plasma fractionation remains a reasonably healthy industry worldwide, with an ever-increasing volume of plasma fractionated each year to meet the demands for safe and effective plasma-derived medicines at the global level. While high-income countries currently have generally good access to a panel of plasma-derived and recombinant products, desperate shortages of fractionated plasma products remain in developing economies, and patients still have to be treated inadequately. The steady development of the collection of whole blood in developing economies, to gradually cover the recognized needs for red blood cell concentrates, generates an increasing volume of recovered plasma that is currently wasted. Incentives are therefore high for those countries to consider fractionating such plasma as a means of enhancing their supply of products to treat patients, thereby also decreasing the level of dependence on imported products. Challenges of local plasma fractionation in developing economies are high, in a context where the technological and regulatory sophistication of the plasma fractionation industry is often underestimated, and the blood supply may be exposed to emerging infectious agents. In parallel, plasma product quality requirements and drivers are evolving in developed economies as is the awareness of clinicians to newer uses of products such as intravenous immunoglobulins, somewhat deviating from what currently remain the basic needs of developing countries in terms of affordable safe plasma products. Global market trends for plasma-derived products, through plasma fractionation, are still increasing, despite increasing use of recombinant products, and attention is being focused on the five Ws of the fractionation field: which products; where; when; what and how much; and who will be the main suppliers?","Burnouf, Thierry; Seghatchian, Jerard",Transfus Apher Sci,89,16

SARS-CoV-2 infected millions of people in the world and immediately became a pandemic in March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the beta-coronavirus genus of the large family of Coronaviridae. It is now known that its surface spike glycoprotein binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), which is expressed on the lung epithelial cells, mediates the fusion of the cellular and viral membranes, and facilitates the entry of viral genome to the host cell. Therefore, blocking the virus-cell interaction could be a potential target for the prevention of viral infection. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 is a protein–protein interaction, and so, analyzing the structure of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and its underlying mechanism to bind the host cell receptor would be useful for the management and treatment of COVID-19. In this study, we performed comparative in silico studies to deeply understand the structural and functional details of the interaction between the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and its cognate cellular receptor ACE2. According to our results, the affinity of the ACE2 receptor for SARS-CoV-2 was higher than SARS-CoV. According to the free energy decomposition of the spike glycoprotein-ACE2 complex, we found critical points in three areas which are responsible for the increased binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 compared with SARS-CoV. These mutations occurred at the receptor-binding domain of the spike glycoprotein that play an essential role in the increasing the affinity of coronavirus to ACE2. For instance, mutations Pro462Ala and Leu472Phe resulted in the altered binding energy from − 2 kcal mol(−1) in SARS-COV to − 6 kcal mol(−1) in SARS-COV-2. The results demonstrated that some mutations in the receptor-binding motif could be considered as a hot-point for designing potential drugs to inhibit the interaction between the spike glycoprotein and ACE2.","Jafary, Farzaneh; Jafari, Sepideh; Ganjalikhany, Mohamad Reza",Sci Rep,89,14

METHODOLOGY: An online survey was proposed to people with or without IBS during the exponential phase of the pandemic in France. The questionnaire included questions about socio-demographic data, conditions of confinement, activities carried out, IBS characteristics, measurement of stress level, consequences on sleep, fatigue, anxiety and depression, and quality of life (both perceived non-specific and specific for IBS). RESULTS/DISCUSSION: From March 31 to April 15, 2020, 304 participants, 232 with IBS and 72 without were included in the survey (mean age: 46.8 ± 16.8 years, female gender: 75.3%). Age, level of education, financial resources, living space per person and activities performed during confinement were identical in both groups. Stress linked to fear of COVID-19, lockdown and financial worries was at the same level in both groups, but the psychological consequences and deterioration of quality of life (QOL) were both higher in IBS participants. In a univariate analysis, teleworking, solitary confinement, and low household resources had a variable impact on the scores of depression, anxiety, fatigue and non-specific perceived QOL, but in a multivariate analysis, the only factor explaining a deterioration of non-specific QOL was the fact of suffering from IBS. CONCLUSION/PERSPECTIVES: Stress linked to the COVID-19 pandemic and confinement is high and equivalent in both IBS and non-IBS participants, with higher psychological and QOL consequences in IBS patients who have altered coping capacities.","Sabate, J.-M.; Deutsch, D.; Melchior, C.; Entremont, A.; Mion, F.; Bouchoucha, M.; Façon, S.; Raynaud, J.-J.; Zerbib, F.; Jouët, P.",Ethics Med Public Health,89,1

However, few studies have investigated the effects of mechanically stretched -MSCs (MS-MSCs) in in vitro models of ARDS. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential therapeutic effects of MS-MSCs on pulmonary microvascular endothelium barrier injuries induced by LPS. We introduced a cocultured model of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell (EC) and MSC medium obtained from MSCs with or without mechanical stretch. We found that Wright-Giemsa staining revealed that MSC morphology changed significantly and cell plasma shrank separately after mechanical stretch. Cell proliferation of the MS-MSC groups was much lower than the untreated MSC group; expression of cell surface markers did not change significantly. Compared to the medium from untreated MSCs, inflammatory factors elevated statistically in the medium from MS-MSCs. Moreover, the paracellular permeability of endothelial cells treated with LPS was restored with a medium from MS-MSCs, while LPS-induced EC apoptosis decreased. In addition, protective effects on the remodeling of intercellular junctions were observed when compared to LPS-treated endothelial cells. These data demonstrated that the MS-MSC groups had potential therapeutic effects on the LPS-treated ECs; these results might be useful in the treatment of ARDS.","Li, Jin-ze; Meng, Shan-shan; Xu, Xiu-Ping; Huang, Yong-bo; Mao, Pu; Li, Yi-min; Yang, Yi; Qiu, Hai-bo; Pan, Chun",Stem Cells Int,89,16

Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of corticosteroids in non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID19 pneumonia complicated by acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF). Methods: This was a single center retrospective cohort study, comprising of 205 patients admitted to the general wards with COVID19 pneumonia. The primary outcome was a composite of ICU transfer, intubation, or inhospital mortality. Cox proportional hazard regression was implemented. Result: Among 205 patients, 60 (29.27%) were treated with corticosteroid. The mean age was ~57 years, and ~75% were men. Thirteen patients (22.41%) developed a primary composite outcome in the corticosteroid cohort vs. 54 (37.5%) patients in the non-corticosteroid cohort (P=0.039). The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for the development of the composite primary outcome was 0.15 (95% CI, 0.07 to 0.33; P <0.001). The adjusted hazard ratio for ICU transfer was 0.16 (95% CI, 0.07 to 0.34; P < 0.001), intubation was 0.31 (95% CI, 0.14 to 0.70; P=0.005), death was 0.53 (95% CI, 0.22 to 1.31; P=0.172), and discharge was 3.65 (95% CI, 2.20 to 6.06; P<0.001). The corticosteroid cohort had increasing SpO2/FiO2 over time compared to the non-corticosteroid cohort who experience decreasing SpO2/FiO2 over time. Conclusion: Among non-ICU patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by AHRF, treatment with corticosteroid was associated with a significantly lower risk of the primary composite outcome of ICU transfer, intubation, or inhospital death.","Majmundar, Monil; Kansara, Tikal; Lenik, Joanna M; Park, Hansang; Ghosh, Kuldeep; Doshi, Rajkumar; Shah, Palak; Kumar, Ashish; Amin, Hossam; Chaudhari, Shobhana; Habtes, Imnette",,89,3

Fecal BKV excretion was significantly correlated with that of the urine (P=0.036) and was significantly associated with allogeneic HSCT (P=0.037) and persistent and peaking of urinary BKV excretion (P<0.001). Binary logistic regression showed that BKV viruria was the only significant risk factor for fecal BKV excretion (P=0.021). Fecal BKV excretion occurred in 40% patients undergoing HSCT, implicating the gastrointestinal tract as a BKV latency site.","Wong, A S Y; Cheng, V C C; Yuen, K-Y; Kwong, Y-L; Leung, A Y H",Bone Marrow Transplant,89,20

Moreover, chronic inflammation associated with TB leads to pulmonary damage that can remain even after successful cure. Thus, there is a great need for the development of effective shorter drug regimens to improve clinical outcome and strengthen TB control. Host-directed therapy (HDT) is emerging as a novel adjunctive strategy to enhance the efficacy and shorten the duration of TB treatment. Previously, we showed that the administration of CC-3052, a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor (PDE4i), reduced the host inflammatory response during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection and improved the antimicrobial efficacy of isoniazid (INH) in both the mouse and rabbit models. In the present study, we evaluated the pharmacokinetics and explored the mechanism underlying the efficacy of a more potent PDE4i, CC-11050, as adjunct to INH treatment in a mouse model of pulmonary Mtb infection. Genome-wide lung transcriptome analysis confirmed the dampening of inflammation and associated network genes that we previously reported with CC-3052. Consistent with the reduction in inflammation, a significant improvement in Mtb control and pathology was observed in the lungs of mice treated with CC-11050 plus INH, compared to INH alone. This important confirmatory study will be used to help design upcoming human clinical trials with CC-11050 as an HDT for TB treatment.","Subbian, Selvakumar; Koo, Mi-Sun; Tsenova, Liana; Khetani, Vikram; Zeldis, Jerome B.; Fallows, Dorothy; Kaplan, Gilla",Front Immunol,89,1

The objectives of this study are to estimate the overall effect of the pandemic on essential health service use and outcomes in Mexico, describe observed and predicted trends in services over 24 months, and to estimate the number of visits lost through December 2020. METHODS: We used health information system data for January 2019 to December 2020 from the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS), which provides health services for more than half of Mexico’s population—65 million people. Our analysis includes nine indicators of service use and three outcome indicators for reproductive, maternal and child health and non-communicable disease services. We used an interrupted time series design and linear generalised estimating equation models to estimate the change in service use and outcomes from April to December 2020. Estimates were expressed using average marginal effects on the risk ratio scale. RESULTS: The study found that across nine health services, an estimated 8.74 million patient visits were lost in Mexico. This included a decline of over two thirds for breast and cervical cancer screenings (79% and 68%, respectively), over half for sick child visits and female contraceptive services, approximately one-third for childhood vaccinations, diabetes, hypertension and antenatal care consultations, and a decline of 10% for deliveries performed at IMSS. In terms of patient outcomes, the proportion of patients with diabetes and hypertension with controlled conditions declined by 22% and 17%, respectively. Caesarean section rate did not change. CONCLUSION: Significant disruptions in health services show that the pandemic has strained the resilience of the Mexican health system and calls for urgent efforts to resume essential services and plan for catching up on missed preventive care even as the COVID-19 crisis continues in Mexico.","Doubova, Svetlana V; Leslie, Hannah H; Kruk, Margaret E; Pérez-Cuevas, Ricardo; Arsenault, Catherine",BMJ Glob Health,89,21

This study investigates changes in waste disposal characteristics and the relationship between the mass of biomedical waste disposed and new COVID-19 tests performed in Regina, Canada. Results suggest that between May and September 2020, significant differences in the median amount of waste disposed exist. The amount of monthly waste disposed was slightly lower to about 450–550 tonnes/month. Monthly waste data variability, however, was significantly lower. Seasonal effects on total waste disposal is observed, but is less obvious than pre-COVID time. Furthermore, the distribution of different waste fractions varies, probably due to operational and industrial characteristics. A non-linear relationship exists between the number of COVID-19 tests performed and the mass of biomedical waste disposed, perhaps due to a lagged relationship between biomedical waste generation and disposal.","Richter, Amy; Ng, Kelvin Tsun Wai; Vu, Hoang Lan; Kabir, Golam",Waste Manag,89,1

The COVID-19 rapidly spread across the nations with high mortality rate even as very little is known to contain the virus at present. In the current study, we report novel natural metabolites namely, ursolic acid, carvacrol and oleanolic acid as the potential inhibitors against main protease (M(pro)) of COVID-19 by using integrated molecular modeling approaches. From a combination of molecular docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, we found three ligands bound to protease during 50 ns of MD simulations. Furthermore, the molecular mechanic/generalized/Born/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/G/P/BSA) free energy calculations showed that these chemical molecules have stable and favourable energies causing strong binding with binding site of M(pro) protein. All these three molecules, namely, ursolic acid, carvacrol and oleanolic acid, have passed the ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion) property as well as Lipinski’s rule of five. The study provides a basic foundation and suggests that the three phytochemicals, viz. ursolic acid, carvacrol and oleanolic acid could serve as potential inhibitors in regulating the M(pro) protein’s function and controlling viral replication.

Previous work examining pediatric and nonsurgical adult patients has documented the effectiveness of inexpensive, nonpharmacological techniques to reduce anxiety and pain as well as health care costs and length of hospitalization. However, the impact of nonpharmacological interventions administered by a dedicated comfort coach has not been evaluated in an adult surgical setting. OBJECTIVE: This trial aims to assess whether nonpharmacological interventions administered by a trained comfort coach affect patient experience, opioid use, and health care utilization compared with usual care in adult cardiac surgery patients. This study has 3 specific aims: assess the effect of a comfort coach on patient experience, measure differences in inpatient and outpatient opioid use and postoperative health care utilization, and qualitatively evaluate the comfort coach intervention. METHODS: To address these aims, we will perform a prospective, randomized controlled trial of 154 adult cardiac surgery patients at Michigan Medicine. Opioid-naive patients undergoing first-time, elective cardiac surgery via sternotomy will be randomized to undergo targeted interventions from a comfort coach (intervention) versus usual care (control). The individualized comfort coach interventions will be administered at 6 points: preoperative outpatient clinic, preoperative care unit on the day of surgery, extubation, chest tube removal, hospital discharge, and 30-day clinic follow-up. To address aim 1, we will examine the effect of a comfort coach on perioperative anxiety, self-reported pain, functional status, and patient satisfaction through validated surveys administered at preoperative outpatient clinic, discharge, 30-day follow-up, and 90-day follow-up. For aim 2, we will record inpatient opioid use and collect postdischarge opioid use and pain-related outcomes through an 11-item questionnaire administered at the 30-day follow-up. Hospital length of stay, readmission, number of days in an extended care facility, emergency room, urgent care, and an unplanned doctor’s office visit will be recorded as the primary composite endpoint defined as total days spent at home within the first 30 days after surgery. For aim 3, we will perform semistructured interviews with patients in the intervention arm to understand the comfort coach intervention through a thematic analysis. RESULTS: This trial, funded by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Foundation in 2019, is presently enrolling patients with anticipated manuscript submissions from our primary aims targeted for the end of 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Data generated from this mixed methods study will highlight effective nonpharmacological techniques and support a multidisciplinary approach to perioperative care during the adult cardiac surgery patient experience. This study’s findings may serve as the foundation for a subsequent multicenter trial and broader dissemination of these techniques to other types of surgery.

However, among these peptides, the role of adipocyte-specific fatty-acid-binding protein (AFABP), chemerin, and secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) in gestational diabetes (GDM) has not been fully investigated. METHOD: The maternal fasting level of adipocytokines of 53 subjects with GDM and 43 normal pregnant (NGDM) was measured using multiplex immunoassay at 24–28 weeks, before delivery, immediate postpartum, and 2–6 months postpuerperium. RESULTS: Higher levels of AFABP were associated with a 3.7-fold higher risk of GDM. Low chemerin levels were associated with a 3.6-fold higher risk of GDM. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) was inversely associated with the risk of GDM. SPARC had no association with GDM. AFABP was directly correlated to interleukin-6 (r = 0.50), insulin resistance index (r = 0.26), and body mass index (r = 0.28) and inversely correlated to C-reactive protein (r = −0.27). Chemerin levels were directly and strongly correlated with IL-10 (r = 0.41) and interleukin-4 (r = 0.50) and inversely correlated to insulin resistance index (r = −0.23) in GDM but not NGDM. In the longitudinal assessment, there were no significant differences in AFABP and chemerin concentrations of both studied groups. CONCLUSION: AFABP and chemerin were associated with a higher risk of GDM. These adipocytokines were related to insulin resistance, body mass index, and inflammation in pregnant women diagnosed with GDM.","Mosavat, Maryam; Mirsanjari, Mitra; Lwaleed, Bashir A.; Kamarudin, Maherah; Omar, Siti Zawiah",J Diabetes Res,89,1

However, despite the potential, adoption rates remained low. With the outbreak of COVID-19, it has suddenly been pushed to the forefront of care delivery. As we progress into the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a need and opportunity to review the impact remote care had in primary care settings and reassess its potential future role. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the perspectives of general practitioners (GPs) and family doctors on the (1) use of virtual care during the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) perceived impact on quality and safety of care, and (3) essential factors for high-quality and sustainable use of virtual care in the future. METHODS: This study used an online cross-sectional questionnaire completed by GPs distributed across 20 countries. The survey was hosted in Qualtrics and distributed using email, social media, and the researchers’ personal contact networks. GPs were eligible for the survey if they were working mainly in primary care during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive statistical analysis will be performed for quantitative variables, and relationships between the use of virtual care and perceptions on impact on quality and safety of care and participants’ characteristics may be explored. Qualitative data (free-text responses) will be analyzed using framework analysis. RESULTS: Data collection took place from June 2020 to September 2020. As of this manuscript’s submission, a total of 1605 GP respondents participated in the questionnaire. Further data analysis is currently ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: The study will provide a comprehensive overview of the availability of virtual care technologies, perceived impact on quality and safety of care, and essential factors for high-quality future use. In addition, a description of the underlying factors that influence this adoption and perceptions, in both individual GP and family doctor characteristics and the context in which they work, will be provided. While the COVID-19 pandemic may prove the first great stress test of the capabilities, capacity, and robustness of digital systems currently in use, remote care will likely remain an increasingly common approach in the future. There is an imperative to identify the main lessons from this unexpected transformation and use them to inform policy decisions and health service design.

Necropsy studies are increasingly revealing underlying endothelial vasculopathies in the form of micro-haemorrhages and micro-thrombi. Intertwined with defective antiviral responses, dysregulated coagulation mechanisms, abnormal hyper-inflammatory reactions and responses, COVID-19 is disclosing a wide pathophysiological palette. An additional property in categorising the disease is the combination of tissue (e.g. neuro- and vasculo-tropism) with organ tropism, whereby the virus preferentially attacks certain organs with highly developed capillary beds, such as the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, kidney and brain. These multiple clinical presentations confirm that the acute respiratory syndrome as described initially is increasingly unfolding as a more complex nosological entity, a multiorgan syndrome of systemic breadth. The neurological manifestations of COVID-19, the focus of this review, reflect this manifold nature of the disease.","Barrantes, Francisco J.",Brain Behav Immun Health,89,1

OBJECTIVES: To compare the impact of a syndromic test performed in the ED as a POCT and in the central laboratory on length of stay (LOS), antibiotic use and single-room assignment. METHODS: From 19 November 2019 to 9 March 2020, adults with acute respiratory illness seeking care in the ED of a large hospital were enrolled, with mPCR performed with a weekly alternation in the ED as a POCT (week A) or in the central laboratory (week B). RESULTS: 474 patients were analysed: 275 during A weeks and 199 during B weeks. Patient characteristics were similar.

Health systems worldwide responded with swift changes to increase workflow capacity while protecting the vulnerable, including those with cancer. This led to unprecedented and rapid restructuring of health service provision. Published data from the 2003 SARS pandemic focuses on medical and nursing staff, overlooking other departmental employees such as administration officers or food service workers. Our protocol aims to document directives and adjustments communicated to staff in two cancer care departments and correlate this with measures of distress and perceived preparedness across the spectrum of all staff involved in cancer care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We use a semiqualitative approach comprising weekly diarising of events and simultaneous staff surveys. Principal investigators will document changes at a metropolitan quaternary cancer centre and a regional cancer centre. Communications, directives and changes will be diarised in real time in four executional domains. Simultaneously, prospective voluntary self-administered online surveys will be conducted at regular intervals by staff. The survey assesses the perceived institutional preparedness and personal well-being, with a combination of Likert scaled and open response questions. A semiquantitative self-assessment of distress adapted from National Comprehensive Cancer Network distress thermometer is incorporated. Additionally, open-text personal reflections on themes including difficult decisions will be invited. Survey participants will be drawn from various work areas of the cancer care departments: administrative staff, health professionals, for example, allied health, ancillary workers, nursing and medical. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been reviewed and approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee (LNR/2020/QRBW/62982). Published literature on domains of distress neglects categories of healthcare worker who form an essential part of the care delivery team. Our study hopes to gather insights about psychosocial impact and adjustment which could direct responses in future emergencies.","Gasper, Harry; Ahern, Elizabeth; Roberts, Natasha; Chan, Bryan; Hughes, Brett; Kennedy, Glen; Wyld, David; Eastgate, Melissa; Lwin, Zarnie",BMJ Open,89,16

We aim to provide a summary of learned experiences and important considerations for implementing and offering telehealth to provide laryngology subspecialty care during the COVID-19 pandemic and thereafter. MATERIALS AND METHODS: : Four laryngologists and a voice-specialized speech-language pathologist from a tertiary-care academic Voice and Swallowing Center were engaged in a structured group consensus conference. Participants shared input, experiences and practice patterns employed via telemedicine (via telephone or video-communication) during the early COVID-19 era. RESULTS: : Key identified areas of consideration when offering telemedicine included (1) how to set up and structure a telemedicine visit and maintain patient confidentiality, (2) patient examination and treatment initiation, (3) optimization of the tele-visit, (4) limitations and recognition of when a tele-visit is insufficient for patient care needs, (5) billing/reimbursement considerations. Group consensus for the aforementioned topics is summarized and discussed. CONCLUSION: : During the COVID-19 pandemic, a telemedicine model can be effectively employed to improve patient access to subspecialty laryngology care, including a multi-disciplinary care approach, with initiation of various therapeutic interventions. A major limitation given the preclusion of in-person assessment is the lack of access to laryngoscopy, which can likely be delayed safely in the majority of individuals.","Strohl, Madeleine P.; Dwyer, Christopher D.; Ma, Yue; Rosen, Clark A.; Schneider, Sarah L.; Young, VyVy N.",J Voice,89,6

Its high transmission rate has resulted in nosocomial infections in health care facilities all over the world. Nursing personnel account for nearly 50% of the global health workforce and are the primary provider of direct care in hospitals and long-term care facilities. Nurses stand on the frontline against the spread of this pandemic, and proper protection procedures are vital. OBJECTIVES: The present study aims to share the procedures and measures used by Taiwan nursing personnel to help reduce global transmission. REVIEW METHODS: Compared with other regions, where large-scale epidemics have overwhelmed the health systems, Taiwan has maintained the number of confirmed cases within a manageable scope. A review of various national and international policies and guidelines was done to present proper procedures and preventions for nursing personnel in health care settings. RESULTS: This study shows how Taiwan's health system rapidly identified suspected cases as well as the prevention policies and strategies, key protection points for nursing personnel in implementing high-risk nursing tasks, and lessons from a nursing perspective. CONCLUSIONS: Various world media have affirmed the rapid response and effective epidemic-prevention strategies of Taiwan's health system. Education for nurses in procedures for infection control, reporting cases, and implementing protective measures to prevent nosocomial infections are critical to prevent further outbreaks.","Liu, Shu-Yen; Kang, Xiao Linda; Wang, Chia-Hui; Chu, Hsin; Jen, Hsiu-Ju; Lai, Hui-Ju; Shen, Shu-Tai H.; Liu, Doresses; Chou, Kuei-Ru",Aust Crit Care,89,20

Balloting was used to assign two schools (public and private) with 25 participants to the intervention group, and the other two schools (public and private) with 25 participants as waiting-list controls. The two groups were dyad-matched for baseline ISI scores, gender, and type of school to reduce baseline differences. The treatment group received weekly group-based manualised CBT-based intervention over 5 weeks. Primary outcome was ISI score at 6th week. Secondary outcomes were sleep onset latency (SOL), Total sleep duration (TSD), depressive symptoms, sleep hygiene, and knowledge about sleep. RESULTS: Participants were aged 13–17 years (M = 14.9, SD = 1.16) and consisted of 18 males and 32 females. Controlling for baseline scores, the intervention group showed significantly lower post-intervention insomnia scores compared with the control group {F (1, 34) = 1.10, p = 0.0001, (ηp(2) = 0.59}, shorter SOL {F (1, 33) = 1.41, p = 0.0001, ηp(2) = 0.39}, longer TSD {F (1, 33) = 1.03, p = 0.0001, ηp(2) = 0.47}, lower depressive symptoms {F (1, 31) = 1.32, p = 0.002 (ηp(2) = 0.34}, higher knowledge of sleep {F (1, 34) = 1.02, p = 0.001, ηp(2) = 0.36}, but no significant change in sleep hygiene {F (1, 32) = 1.08, p = 0.08, ηp(2) = 0.15}. All participants in the intervention group rated the programme as good or excellent. CONCLUSION: This pilot CBT-based intervention for adolescents with insomnia was feasible, well received and showed promising efficacy in this setting. Larger controlled trials are recommended to establish the generalisability of these findings in this region.

Online food outlet access has not previously been investigated in England or across an entire country. Systematic differences in online food outlet access could exacerbate existing health inequalities, which is a public health concern. However, this is not known. Across postcode districts in England (n = 2118), we identified and described the number of food outlets and unique cuisine types accessible online from the market leader (Just Eat). We investigated associations with area-level deprivation using adjusted negative binomial regression models. We also compared the number of food outlets accessible online with the number physically accessible in the neighbourhood (1600m Euclidean buffers of postcode district geographic centroids) and investigated associations with deprivation using an adjusted general linear model. For each outcome, we predicted means and 95% confidence intervals. In November 2019, 29,232 food outlets were registered to accept orders online. Overall, the median number of food outlets accessible online per postcode district was 63.5 (IQR; 16.0–156.0). For the number of food outlets accessible online as a percentage of the number accessible within the neighbourhood, the median was 63.4% (IQR; 35.6–96.5). Analysis using negative binomial regression showed that online food outlet access was highest in the most deprived postcode districts (n = 106.1; 95% CI: 91.9, 120.3). The number of food outlets accessible online as a percentage of those accessible within the neighbourhood was highest in the least deprived postcode districts (n = 86.2%; 95% CI: 78.6, 93.7). In England, online food outlet access is socioeconomically patterned. Further research is required to understand how online food outlet access is related to using online food delivery services.","Keeble, Matthew; Adams, Jean; Bishop, Tom R.P.; Burgoine, Thomas",Appl Geogr,89,26

Porcine kobuviruses were detected in 13.1 % (33/251) of the samples. We demonstrated that porcine kobuvirus infections exist in indigenous pigs in Kenya and Uganda and that the prevalence was higher in young piglets than older pigs: nursing piglets (15 %), post-weaning (3-month-old) pigs (17 %), 4-month-old pigs (10 %). Genetic analysis of the partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) region (690 nt) revealed that kobuviruses circulating in East Africa are diverse, sharing nucleotide sequence identities ranging from 89.7 to 99.1 % and 88 to 92.3 % among them and with known porcine kobuviruses, respectively. The nucleotide sequence identities between our kobuvirus strains and those of human, bovine and canine kobuviruses were 69.4-70.7 %, 73.1-74.4 % and 67-70.7 %, respectively. Additionally, upon sequencing selected samples that showed consistent 720-bp RT-PCR bands while using the same primer set, we detected porcine astroviruses in our samples belonging to type 2 and type 3 mamastroviruses. To our knowledge, this study reports the first detection and molecular analysis of both porcine kobuviruses and astroviruses in an African region. Further studies are required to determine the role of these viruses in gastrointestinal infections of pigs in this region and to determine the genetic diversity of the circulating strains to develop accurate diagnostic tools and implement appropriate control strategies.","Amimo, Joshua O.; Okoth, Edward; Junga, Joseph O.; Ogara, William O.; Njahira, Moses N.; Wang, Qiuhong; Vlasova, Anastasia N.; Saif, Linda J.; Djikeng, Appolinaire",Arch Virol,89,1

We explored the concept of Opioid Treatment Deserts including racial differences in potential spatial accessibility and applied it to one Midwestern urban county using high resolution spatiotemporal data. METHODS: We obtained individual-level data from one Emergency Medical Services (EMS) agency (Columbus Fire Department) in Franklin County, Ohio. Opioid overdose events were based on EMS runs where naloxone was administered from 1/1/2013 to 12/31/2017. Potential spatial accessibility was measured as the time (in minutes) it would take an individual, who may decide to seek treatment after an opioid overdose, to travel from where they had the overdose event, which was a proxy measure of their residential location, to the nearest opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment provider that provided medically-assisted treatment (MAT). We estimated accessibility measures overall, by race and by four types of treatment providers (any type of MAT for OUD, Buprenorphine, Methadone, or Naltrexone). Areas were classified as an Opioid Treatment Desert if the estimate travel time to treatment provider (any type of MAT for OUD) was greater than a given threshold. We performed sensitivity analysis using a range of threshold values based on multiple modes of transportation (car and public transit) and using only EMS runs to home/residential location types. RESULTS: A total of 6,929 geocoded opioid overdose events based on data from EMS agencies were used in the final analysis. Most events occurred among 26–35 years old (34%), identified as White adults (56%) and male (62%). Median travel times and interquartile range (IQR) to closest treatment provider by car and public transit was 2 minutes (IQR: 3 minutes) and 17 minutes (IQR: 17 minutes), respectively. Several neighborhoods in the study area had limited accessibility to OUD treatment facilities and were classified as Opioid Treatment Deserts. Travel time by public transit for most treatment provider types and by car for Methadone-based treatment was significantly different between individuals who were identified as Black adults and White adults based on their race. CONCLUSIONS: Disparities in access to opioid treatment exist at the sub-county level in specific neighborhoods and across racial groups in Columbus, Ohio and can be quantified and visualized using local public safety data (e.g., EMS runs). Identification of Opioid Treatment Deserts can aid multiple stakeholders better plan and allocate resources for more equitable access to MAT for OUD and, therefore, reduce the burden of the opioid epidemic while making better use of real-time public safety data to address a public health epidemic that has turned into a public safety crisis.","Hyder, Ayaz; Lee, Jinhyung; Dundon, Ashley; Southerland, Lauren T.; All, David; Hammond, Gretchen; Miller, Harvey J.",PLoS One,89,1

We used a telephone survey with random sampling and obtained a probability community sample of 616 adults (39.1% men; M(age) = 41.7, SD(age) = 16.3) in Macao, China in April 2020. The prevalence of 8.8% probable depression and 12.0% probable anxiety was observed in this sample. Positive perceptions toward government’s pandemic responses were found to be negatively associated with probable depression and probable anxiety (ORu = .36 and .41, p < .05). Three lifestyle-changing stressors (i.e., increased family conflict, friendship deterioration, and weight gain), were commonly reported (29.9, 27.5, and 43.0% respectively), and displayed positive associations with probable depression (ORu = 1.67 to 1.87, p < .05) and probable anxiety (ORu = 1.54 to 2.10, p < .05). Our findings suggest protective effects of perceived trust and satisfaction regarding government’s pandemic responses against mental distress and the potential mental health threats from three pandemic-specific lifestyle-changing stressors. These findings can inform clinicians and policymakers to better prepare for the mental health impacts of the current and future pandemics.","Chen, Juliet Honglei; Yu, Eilo Wing-yat; Su, Xiaoyu; Tong, Kwok Kit; Wu, Anise M.

Some orthopaedic surgeons in Wuhan were infected with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a survey to identify the orthopaedic surgeons who were infected with COVID-19 in Wuhan. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to collect information such as social demographic variables, clinical manifestations, exposure history, awareness of the outbreak, infection control training provided by hospitals, and individual protection practices. To further explore the possible risk factors at the individual level, a 1:2 matched case-control study was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 26 orthopaedic surgeons from 8 hospitals in Wuhan were identified as having COVID-19. The incidence in each hospital varied from 1.5% to 20.7%. The onset of symptoms was from January 13 to February 5, 2020, and peaked on January 23, 8 days prior to the peak of the public epidemic. The suspected sites of exposure were general wards (79.2%), public places at the hospital (20.8%), operating rooms (12.5%), the intensive care unit (4.2%), and the outpatient clinic (4.2%). There was transmission from these doctors to others in 25% of cases, including to family members (20.8%), to colleagues (4.2%), to patients (4.2%), and to friends (4.2%). Participation in real-time training on prevention measures was found to have a protective effect against COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR], 0.12). Not wearing an N95 respirator was found to be a risk factor (OR, 5.20 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09 to 25.00]). Wearing respirators or masks all of the time was found to be protective (OR, 0.15). Severe fatigue was found to be a risk factor (OR, 4 [95% CI, 1 to 16]) for infection with COVID-19.

In addition to causing cardiovascular and respiratory lethal dysfunction, these viruses can cause neurodegeneration leading to neurological disorders. Review of the current scientific literature reveals the multiple neuropathies and neuronal dysfunction associated with these viruses. Here, we review the major findings of these studies and discuss the main neurological sequels and outcomes of coronavirus infections with SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. This article analyzes and discusses the main mechanisms of coronavirus-induced neurodegeneration according to the current experimental and clinical studies. Coronaviruses can damage the nerves directly through endovascular dysfunctions thereby affecting nerve structures and synaptic connections. Coronaviruses can also induce neural cell degeneration indirectly via mitochondrial dysfunction inducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. Thus, coronaviruses can cause neurological disorders by inducing neurovascular dysfunction affecting nerve structures and synaptic connections, and by inducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. While some of these mechanisms are similar to other RNA viruses, the neurotoxic mechanisms of COVID-19, MERS, and SARS-CoV viruses are unknown and need detailed clinical and experimental studies.","Gholami, Mina; Safari, Sepideh; Ulloa, Luis; Motaghinejad, Majid",J Neurovirol,89,26

Studies documenting approaches to deliver MAB infusions and demonstrating their efficacy are lacking. OBJECTIVE: We describe our experience and the outcomes of almost 3000 patients who received MAB infusion therapy at Northwell Health, a large integrated health care system in New York. METHODS: This is a descriptive study of adult patients who received MAB therapy between November 20, 2020, to January 31, 2021, and a retrospective cohort survival analysis comparing patients who received MAB therapy prior to admission versus those who did not. A multivariable Cox model with inverse probability weighting according to the propensity score including covariates (sociodemographic, comorbidities, and presenting vital signs) was used. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality; additional evaluations included emergency department use and hospitalization within 28 days of a positive COVID-19 test for patients who received MAB therapy. RESULTS: During the study period, 2818 adult patients received MAB infusion. Following therapy and within 28 days of a COVID-19 test, 123 (4.4%) patients presented to the emergency department and were released, and 145 (5.1%) patients were hospitalized. These 145 patients were compared with 200 controls who were eligible for but did not receive MAB therapy and were hospitalized. In the MAB group, 16 (11%) patients met the primary outcome of in-hospital mortality, versus 21 (10.5%) in the control group. In an unadjusted Cox model, the hazard ratio (HR) for time to in-hospital mortality for the MAB group was 1.38 (95% CI 0.696-2.719). Models adjusting for demographics (HR 1.1, 95% CI 0.53-2.23), demographics and Charlson Comorbidity Index (HR 1.22, 95% CI 0.573-2.59), and with inverse probability weighting according to propensity scores (HR 1.19, 95% CI 0.619-2.29) did not demonstrate significance. The hospitalization rate was 4.4% for patients who received MAB therapy within 0 to 4 days, 5% within 5 to 7 days, and 6.1% in ≥8 days of symptom onset (P=.15). CONCLUSIONS: Establishing the capability to provide neutralizing MAB infusion therapy requires substantial planning and coordination. Although this therapy may be an important treatment option for early mild to moderate COVID-19 in patients who are at high risk, further investigations are needed to define the optimal timing of MAB treatment to reduce hospitalization and mortality.","Jarrett, Mark; Licht, Warren; Bock, Kevin; Brown, Zenobia; Hirsch, Jamie; Coppa, Kevin; Brar, Rajdeep; Bello, Stephen; Nash, Ira",JMIRx Med,89,1

The analysis of related prognostic factors in diabetic patients with COVID-19 would be helpful for further treatment of such patients. Methods: This retrospective study involved 3623 patients with COVID-19 (325 with diabetes). Clinical characteristics and laboratory tests were collected and compared between the diabetic group and the non-diabetic group. Binary logistic regression analysis was applied to explore risk factors associated in diabetic patients with COVID-19. A prediction model was built based on these risk factors. Results: The risk factors for higher mortality in diabetic patients with COVID-19 were dyspnea, lung disease, cardiovascular diseases, neutrophil, PLT count, and CKMB. Similarly, dyspnea, cardiovascular diseases, neutrophil, PLT count, and CKMB were risk factors related to the severity of diabetes with COVID-19. Based on these factors, a risk score was built to predict the severity of disease in diabetic patients with COVID-19. Patients with a score of 7 or higher had an odds ratio of 7.616. Conclusions: Dyspnea is a critical clinical manifestation that is closely related to the severity of disease in diabetic patients with COVID-19.

The survey aimed to provide an overview of existing psychogeriatric services in Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, and North Macedonia. METHODS: After identification of psychogeriatric units across the four countries, their head physicians were asked to provide data on their clinical, teaching, and research activity, as well as staff composition. Moreover, the attitudes of head physicians to current needs and future service development were explored. RESULTS: A total of 15 psychogeriatric units were identified (3 in Bulgaria, 8 in Greece, and 4 in North Macedonia). Results show wide variation regarding the location, team size and composition, service availability, numbers of patients attending, and inpatient treatment length. Most head physicians underscored the urgent need for breakthroughs in the graduate and postgraduate education in psychogeriatrics of medical and nonmedical professionals, as well as in the interconnection of their units with community primary healthcare services and long-term care facilities for seniors via telemedicine. They would welcome the development of national standards for psychogeriatric units, potentially embodying clear pointers for action. A number of head physicians advocated the development of nationwide old age mental health registries. CONCLUSIONS: Regional disparities in resources and services for seniors’ mental health services were unveiled. These data may enrich the dialogue on optimizing psychogeriatric services through planning future cross-border collaborations mainly based on telemedicine services, especially in the era of the novel coronavirus pandemic, and training/education in psychogeriatrics of mental health professionals.","Alexopoulos, P.; Novotni, A.; Novotni, G.; Vorvolakos, T.; Vratsista, A.; Konsta, A.; Kaprinis, S.; Konstantinou, A.; Bonotis, K.; Katirtzoglou, E.; Siarkos, K.; Bekri, E.

With ectodomains of only ∼20–40 residues, it is unclear how such diminutive viral fusion proteins mediate the initial stages (i.e. membrane contact and close membrane apposition) of the fusion reaction that precede actual membrane merger. We now show that the FAST proteins lack specific receptor-binding activity, and in their natural biological context of promoting cell–cell fusion, rely on cadherins to promote close membrane apposition. The FAST proteins, however, are not specifically reliant on cadherin engagement to mediate membrane apposition as indicated by their ability to efficiently utilize other adhesins in the fusion reaction. Results further indicate that surrogate adhesion proteins that bridge membranes as close as 13 nm apart enhance FAST protein-induced cell–cell fusion, but active actin remodelling is required for maximal fusion activity. The FAST proteins are the first example of membrane fusion proteins that have specifically evolved to function as opportunistic fusogens, designed to exploit and convert naturally occurring adhesion sites into fusion sites. The capacity of surrogate, non-cognate adhesins and active actin remodelling to enhance the cell–cell fusion activity of the FAST proteins are features perfectly suited to the structural and functional evolution of these fusogens as the minimal fusion component of a virus-encoded cellular fusion machine. These results also provide a basis for reconciling the rudimentary structure of the FAST proteins with their capacity to fuse cellular membranes.","Salsman, Jayme; Top, Deniz; Barry, Christopher; Duncan, Roy",PLoS Pathog,89,30

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether HRVC-QCE was a distinct HRV-C strain, by determining its genome and prevalence, by cataloguing genomic features for strain discrimination and by observing clinical features in positive patients. STUDY DESIGN: Novel real-time RT-PCRs and retrospective chart reviews were used to investigate a well-defined population of 1247 specimen extracts to observe the prevalence and the clinical features of each HRV-QCE positive case from an in- and out-patient pediatric, hospital-based population during 2003. An objective illness severity score was determined for each HRVC-QCE positive patient. RESULTS: Differences in overall polyprotein and VP1 binding pocket residues and the predicted presence of a cis-acting replication element in 1B defined HRVC-QCE as a novel HRV-C strain. Twelve additional HRVC-QCE detections (1.0% prevalence) occurred among infants and toddlers (1–24 months) suffering mild to moderate illness, including fever and cough, who were often hospitalized. HRVC-QCE was frequently detected in the absence of another virus and was the only virus detected in three (23% of HRVC-QCE positives) children with asthma exacerbation and in two (15%) toddlers with febrile convulsion. CONCLUSIONS: HRVC-QCE is a newly identified, genetically distinct HRV strain detected in hospitalized children with a range of clinical features. HRV strains should be independently considered to ensure we do not overestimate the HRVs in asymptomatic illness.","Arden, K.E.; Faux, C.E.; O’Neill, N.T.; McErlean, P.; Nitsche, A.; Lambert, S.B.; Nissen, M.D.; Sloots, T.P.; Mackay, I.M.",J Clin Virol,89,22

Methods: We enrolled the first five COVID-19 patients quarantined in our institution; none received immunomodulatory treatment. We monitored shedding of viral RNA and infectious virus by RT-PCR and cell culture from the upper respiratory tract, and characterized the kinetics of systemic innate and adaptive immune responses. Results Despite mild clinical disease, high viral loads and shedding of infectious virus were observed from the respiratory tract, with isolation of infectious virus and prolonged positivity by PCR up to day 7 and 19 post onset of symptoms, respectively. Robust innate responses characterized by an increase in activated CD14+CD16+ monocytes and cytokine responses were observed as early as 2 days after symptoms onset. Cellular and humoral SARS-CoV-2 specific adaptive responses were detectable in all patients. Conclusion Infectious virus shedding was limited to the first week of symptom onset in mild cases. A strong innate response, characterized by the mobilization of activated monocytes during the first days of infection, as well as SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies were detectable, even in patients with mild disease.","Vetter, P.; Eberhardt, C.; Meyer, B.; Martinez, P.; Torriani, G.; Pigny, F.; Lemeille, S.; Cordey, S.; Laubscher, F.; Vu, D.-L.; Calame, A.; Schibler, M.; Jacquerioz, F.; Blanchard, G.; Siegrist, C.-A.; Kaiser, L.; Didierlaurent, A.; eckerle, i.",,89,21

Community engagement is the first line of defense in the fight against infectious diseases, and general practitioners (GPs) play an important role in it. GPs are facing unique challenges from disasters and pandemics in delivering health care. However, there is still no suitable mobile management system that can help GPs collect data, dynamically assess risks, and effectively triage or follow-up with patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to design, develop, and deploy a mobile-based decision support system for COVID-19 (DDC19) to assist GPs in collecting data, assessing risk, triaging, managing, and following up with patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Based on the actual scenarios and the process of patients using health care, we analyzed the key issues that need to be solved and designed the main business flowchart of DDC19. We then constructed a COVID-19 dynamic risk stratification model with high recall and clinical interpretability, which was based on a multiclass logistic regression algorithm. Finally, through a 10-fold cross-validation to quantitatively evaluate the risk stratification ability of the model, a total of 2243 clinical data consisting of 36 dimension clinical features from fever clinics were used for training and evaluation of the model. RESULTS: DDC19 is composed of three parts: mobile terminal apps for the patient-end and GP-end, and the database system. All mobile terminal devices were wirelessly connected to the back end data center to implement request sending and data transmission. We used low risk, moderate risk, and high risk as labels, and adopted a 10-fold cross-validation method to evaluate and test the COVID-19 dynamic risk stratification model in different scenarios (different dimensions of personal clinical data accessible at an earlier stage). The data set dimensions were (2243, 15) when only using the data of patients’ demographic information, clinical symptoms, and contact history; (2243, 35) when the results of blood tests were added; and (2243, 36) after obtaining the computed tomography imaging results of the patient. The average value of the three classification results of the macro–area under the curve were all above 0.71 in each scenario. CONCLUSIONS: DCC19 is a mobile decision support system designed and developed to assist GPs in providing dynamic risk assessments for patients with suspected COVID-19 during the outbreak, and the model had a good ability to predict risk levels in any scenario it covered.","Liu, Ying; Wang, Zhixiao; Ren, Jingjing; Tian, Yu; Zhou, Min; Zhou, Tianshu; Ye, Kangli; Zhao, Yinghao; Qiu, Yunqing; Li, Jingsong",J Med Internet Res,89,28

This study included 14 consecutive patients on HD or with advanced CKD who initiated HD after being diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from February to April 2020 in hospitals throughout Daegu, South Korea. The included patients, 42.9% of whom were men, had a mean age of 63.5 years. Four patients had a history of contact with a patient suffering from COVID-19. The most common symptom was cough (50.0%), followed by dyspnea (35.7%). The mean time from symptom onset to diagnosis and admission was 2.6 and 3.5 days, respectively. Patients exhibited lymphopenia and elevated inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein and ferritin. Chest radiography findings showed pulmonary infiltration in 10 patients. All patients underwent regular HD in a negative pressure room and received antiviral agents. Four patients received mechanical ventilation and continuous renal replacement therapy at a median duration of 14.0 and 8.5 days, respectively. One patient underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for three days. Among the 14 patients included, two died due to acute respiratory distress syndrome, nine were discharged from the hospital, and three remained hospitalized. Despite the high-risk conditions associated with worse outcomes, patients on HD did not exhibit extremely poor overall COVID-19 outcomes perhaps due to early diagnosis, prompt hospitalization, and antiviral therapy.","Jung, Hee-Yeon; Lim, Jeong-Hoon; Kang, Seok Hui; Kim, Seong Gyu; Lee, Yong-Hoon; Lee, Jaehee; Chang, Hyun-Ha; Kim, Shin-Woo; Choi, Ji-Young; Cho, Jang-Hee; Kim, Chan-Duck; Kim, Yong-Lim; Park, Sun-Hee",J Clin Med,89,16

Though inner preputial skin graft (IPG) was described even earlier than BMG, its usage lately has fallen out of favour. The aim of the study was to evaluate the outcome of a SU with IPG from a tertiary care centre. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of prospectively maintained clinical data was conducted at our tertiary care centre enrolling 80 patients with anterior urethral stricture from January 2015 to January 2018. Patients were evaluated for the aetiology, length and site of the urethral stricture. All patients underwent dorsolateral SU with IPG. Post-operative assessment including uroflowmetry and sexual outcomes using IIEF and MSHQ-EJD questionnaires was done at 3 weeks, 3 months, 12 months and half-yearly thereafter. Success was defined by the stable maximum urinary flow value > 14 ml/s or urethral calibration with 16 French Foley catheter. RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 40 years (18–69). The most common aetiology was post-instrumentation (65%) and 60% had stricture at penobulbar site. Mean stricture length was 65 mm. At a mean follow-up of 48 months (range 30–66 months), successful outcomes were seen in 69/80 (87%). Patients with failure were managed with optical internal urethrotomy (OIU). Uroflowmetry and obstructive symptoms significantly improved and sexual function remained unaffected using IPG for SU. CONCLUSIONS: Preputial graft is a tissue familiar to the urologist, located very close to the surgical field, easily harvested and operated under regional anaesthesia. Overall success outcomes are acceptable to BMG urethroplasty.

In addition, we discuss advantages, barriers, and enablers of such technology. RECENT FINDINGS: Telemedicine in orthopedics was initially described to discuss simple cases among non-specialist doctors through videoconferencing. Recently, it evolved to postoperative follow-up on selected cases, physical examination, and even teleconsultations direct to patients. Studies have reported that consultation can be offered safely to selected patients. Although this topic is already being addressed for a long time, recent studies have reported that there is still resistance among many orthopedic surgeons. SUMMARY: Telemedicine for orthopedics has safely expanded its operations. It can be used in postoperative follow-up of selected cases, fracture follow-up, and even in pediatric cases. Remote diagnosis of fractures is done successfully on an outpatient basis in many countries. Protocols and methods to standardize the virtual orthopedic examination for common musculoskeletal conditions have been developed. Satisfaction with teleconsultations as well as cost-effectiveness of remote care orthopedics were already well reported by some studies. We believe that remote care will be expanded in several hospitals around the world due to its huge potential. This fact is explained by natural technological development and by change and obliteration of habits accelerated exponentially after COVID-19 crisis.","Foni, Noel Oizerovici; Costa, Lauro Augusto Veloso; Velloso, Leandro Manuel Reis; Pedrotti, Carlos Henrique Sartorato",Curr Rev Musculoskelet Med,89,13

The pandemic caused anxiety and depression in individuals. However, there is insufficient information on the effects of COVID-19 on individuals and their coping methods. Therefore, mental problems associated with the pandemic need to be evaluated rapidly. AIMS: This study was carried out to determine depression levels and related factors in a society affected by COVID-19. METHOD: The study was planned using a descriptive cross-sectional design. The study started 2 weeks after the first diagnosis of COVID-19 in Turkey and was carried out between March 23 and April 3, 2020. The study included 1115 adult participants who were between 18 and 65 years of age and were citizens of the Turkish Republic. The study was carried out using online questionnaires, and data were collected with the Personal Information Form and the Beck Depression Inventory. The data were evaluated using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 20 software program. RESULTS: The depression scores of female participants who were between 18 and 29 years of age, single, students, and had less income than their expenses were found to be higher than others. People who experienced fear of being infected and infecting others, had a cleaning obsession, anxiety about the future, sadness, and anxiousness experienced depression at lower levels when compared to other participants. Participants who had to change their place of residence during the quarantine, experienced loneliness, fear of death, hopelessness, sleep problems, felt useless and worthless, started to smoke and drink alcohol, and experienced depression at moderate levels. Depression scores of those who spent time with their family, made time for themselves, were busy with home education or work were lower compared to others. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic caused mild-level depression in the Turkish society.","Ustun, Gonca",Int J Soc Psychiatry,89,21

Earlier, we reported findings from a phase 1 (vaccination regimen on days 0 and 14) randomised, double-blind trial on the safety and immunogenicity of three different formulations of BBV152 and one control arm containing Algel (without antigen). Two formulations were selected for the phase 2 (days 0 and 28) study. Here, we report interim findings of a controlled, randomised, double-blind trial on the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152, 3{micro} and 6{micro} with Algel-IMDG. Methods We conducted a double-blind, randomised, multicentre, phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152. A total of 380 healthy children and adults were randomised to receive two vaccine formulations (n=190 each) with 3{micro} with Algel-IMDG and 6{micro} with Algel-IMDG. Two intramuscular doses of vaccines were administered (four weeks apart). Participants, investigators, and laboratory staff were blinded to the treatment allocation. The primary outcome was seroconversion (4-fold above baseline) based on wild-type virus neutralisation (PRNT50). Secondary outcomes were reactogenicity and safety. Cell-mediated responses were evaluated. A follow-up blood draw was collected from phase 1 participants at day 104 (three months after the second dose). Findings Among 921 participants screened between Sep 7-13, 2020, 380 participants were randomised to the safety and immunogenicity population. The PRNT50 seroconversion rates of neutralising antibodies on day 56 were 92.9% (88.2, 96.2) and 98.3% (95.1, 99.6) in the 3{micro} and 6{micro} with Algel-IMDG groups, respectively. Higher neutralising titres (2-fold) were observed in the phase 2 study than in the phase 1 study (p<0.05). Both vaccine groups elicited more Th1 cytokines than Th2 cytokines. After two doses, the proportion (95% CI) of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions were 9.7% (6.9, 13.2) and 10.3% (7.4, 13.8) in the 3{micro} and 6{micro} with Algel-IMDG groups, respectively. No significant difference was observed between the groups. No serious adverse events were reported in this study. Phase 1 follow-up immunological samples at day 104 showed seroconversion in 73.5% (63.6, 81.9), 81.1% (71.4, 88.1), and 73.1% (62.9, 81.8) of individuals in the 3{micro} with Algel-IMDG, 6{micro} with Algel-IMDG, and 6{micro} with Algel groups, respectively. Interpretation In the phase 1 trial, BBV152 produced high levels of neutralising antibodies that remained elevated in all participants three months after the second vaccination. In the phase 2 trial, BBV152 led to tolerable safety outcomes and enhanced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. The safety profile of BBV152 is noticeably lower than the rates for other SARS-CoV-2 vaccine platform candidates.

One such population is US veterans, who have high rates of pre‐existing behavioral health conditions and may thus be at‐risk for poorer outcomes. The current study aimed to investigate substance use among US veterans during COVID‐19 as a function of pre‐existing depression, loneliness, and social support. METHODS: We investigated the relationship between pre‐pandemic depression and substance use during COVID‐19 using linear (alcohol) and logistic (cannabis) regression among a large sample of US veterans (N = 1230). We then tested if loneliness and social support moderated these effects. RESULTS: Though there was a decrease in alcohol and cannabis use among the overall sample, veterans who screened for depression prior to the pandemic exhibited higher levels of substance use after the pandemic's onset. Loneliness compounded the effects of depression on rates of alcohol use. Social support was not protective for the effects of depression on either alcohol or cannabis use. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Veterans with pre‐existing depression may be in need of attention for substance use behaviors. Interventions aimed at alleviating loneliness among veterans may be useful in mitigating alcohol use, but not cannabis use, amid COVID‐19. SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings are among the first to report tangible behavioral health outcomes experienced by US veterans as a result of COVID‐19.

Institutional guidance for PLs pursuing field and laboratory work centers on the physical safety of individuals while in the lab or field, but largely ignores the vast differences in how team members may be experiencing the pandemic. Strains on mental, physical, and emotional health; racial trauma; familial responsibilities; and compulsory productivity resources, such as high-speed internet, quiet work spaces, and support are unequally distributed across team members.

The S gene sequences of these viral strains were compared with those of recently published strains BCV-Mebus, BCV-Quebec, and BCV-F15. An open reading frame of 4092 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 1363 amino acid residues, was found in all six strains. Frameshifts and insertions or deletions were not observed except for the BCV-Fl 5. The S gene sequences were more than 98% conserved overall inspite of different origins of the six viruses. There were 45 to 56 nt differences between the virulent and avirulent groups while there were 6 to 14 nt differences among four avirulent strains. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences indicated that the S proteins had typical properties of membrane glycoproteins. Nineteen Winked glycosylation sites were predicted in five strains, and 18 of them were conserved in the avirulent strain BCV-L9. The sequence KRRSRR at the predicted proteolytic cleavage site was identified in five strains while the sequence KRRSVR was found in BCV-Fl 5. Substitutions of few amino acids in the putative fusogenic domains and two prolines at 507 and 567 in the antigenic domains may cause altered immunogenic and other functional properties of the S proteins specified by the virulent and avirulent BCV strains.

Ebola virus (EBOV) is a lethal pathogen that causes up to 90% mortality in humans, whereas H5N1 avian influenza has a 60% fatality rate. Both viruses are considered pandemic threats. The objective was to evaluate the protective efficacy of a bivalent, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vaccine expressing both the A/Hanoi/30408/2005 H5N1 hemagglutinin and the EBOV glycoprotein (VSVΔG-HA-ZGP) in a lethal mouse model of infection. Methods. Mice were vaccinated 28 days before or 30 minutes after a lethal challenge with mouse-adapted EBOV or selected H5N1 influenza viruses from clades 0, 1, and 2. Animals were monitored for weight loss and survival, in addition to humoral and cell-mediated responses after immunization. Results. A single VSVΔG-HA-ZGP injection was efficacious when administered 28 days before a homologous H5N1 and/or mouse-adapted EBOV challenge, as well as a heterologous H5N1 challenge. Postexposure protection was only observed in vaccinated animals challenged with homologous H5N1 and/or mouse-adapted EBOV.

This virus can cause a disease that ranges in spectrum from asymptomatic to severe respiratory disease with multiorgan failure, and the most severe cases are associated with some comorbidities and patient age. However, there are patients who do not have those risk factors who still develop serious disease. In this study, we identified the presence of other respiratory viruses in positive cases of COVID-19 in Mexico to determine if any coinfections were correlated with more severe manifestations of COVID-19. We analysed 103 confirmed cases of COVID-19 using RT-qPCR for the detection of 16 other respiratory viruses.Of the cases analysed, 14 (13.6%) were cases of coinfection, and 92% of them never required hospitalization, even when comorbidities and advanced age were involved. There were not significant differences between the presence of comorbidities and the mean ages of the groups. These results suggest that coinfection is not related to more severe COVID-19 and that, depending on the virus involved, it could even lead to a better prognosis. We believe that our findings may lay the groundwork for new studies aimed at determining the biological mechanism by which this phenomenon occurs and for proposing corresponding strategies to limit the progression to severe cases of COVID-19.","Fernandes-Matano, Larissa; Monroy-MuÃ±oz, Irma Eloisa; Uribe-Noguez, Luis Antonio; HernÃ¡ndez-Cueto, MarÃ­a de los Angeles; Sarquiz-MartÃ­nez, Brenda; Pardavamp, HÃ©ctor Daniel; eacute-Alejandre,; Coy-Arechavaleta, Andrea Santos; Alvarado-Yaah, Julio Elias; Rojas-Mendoza, Teresita; Santacruz-Tinoco, Clara Esperanza; Grajales-MuÃ±iz, ConcepciÃ³n; Borja-Aburto, VÃ­ctor Hugo; MuÃ±oz-Medina, JosÃ© Esteban",,89,27

Cancer history appears to be a poor prognostic factor for COVID-19 patients, though the reasons for this are unclear. In this report, we assess if extent of prior lung irradiation is a risk factor for death due to COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 between March 14(th) and April 15(th), 2020 at our institution and previously received radiotherapy for cancer in our department were included in this analysis. Patient characteristics and metrics describing the extent of lung irradiation were tabulated. Cox regression models were used to identify predictors of death following COVID-19 diagnosis. A logistic model was used to characterize the association between mean lung radiotherapy dose and 14-day mortality risk following COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: 107 patients met inclusion criteria. With a median follow-up of 7 days from COVID-19 diagnosis for surviving patients, 24 deaths have been observed. The actuarial survival rate 14 days after COVID-19 testing is 66%. Increasing mean lung dose (HR per Gy = 1.1, p=0.002), lung cancer diagnosis (HR=3.0, p=0.034), and receiving radiotherapy between one month and one year before COVID-19 testing (HR = 3.4, p=0.013) were associated with increased risk of death. Our survival model demonstrates a near linear relationship between mortality risk following COVID-19 diagnosis and mean lung radiotherapy dose. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients with a history of radiotherapy for cancer have a poor prognosis, and mortality risk appears to be associated with extent of lung irradiation. Validation of these findings will be critical as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.","Kabarriti, Rafi; Brodin, N.

HYPOTHESIS: Propentofylline (PPF) can decrease vasculitis, and therefore prolong survival time in cats with FIP, and increase their quality of life. ANIMALS: Twenty‐three privately owned cats with FIP. METHODS: Placebo‐controlled double‐blind trial. FIP was confirmed by histology or immunostaining of feline coronavirus (FCoV) antigen in effusion or tissue macrophages or both. The cats were randomly selected for treatment with either PPF or placebo. All cats received additional treatment with glucocorticoids, antibiotics, and low molecular weight heparin according to methods. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in the survival time of cats treated with PPF (8 days, 95% CI 5.4–10.6) versus placebo (7.5 days, 95% CI 4.4–9.6). The median survival time of all cats was 8 days (4–36 days). There was neither a difference in quality of life (day 7, P = .892), in the amount of effusion (day 7, P = .710), the tumor necrosis factor‐alpha (TNF‐α) concentration (day 7, P = .355), nor in any other variable investigated in this study, including a complete blood count, and a small animal biochemistry profile. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: This study did not detect an effect of PPF on the survival time, the quality of life, or any clinical or laboratory parameter in cats with FIP. Therefore, PPF does not appear to be an effective treatment option in cats with a late stage of the disease FIP.","Fischer, Y.; Ritz, S.; Weber, K.; Sauter‐Louis, C.; Hartmann, K.",J Vet Intern Med,89,24

The recent pandemic of COVID-19 not only causes infection per se but also has an impact on mental health. This case series aimed to explore the role of VRET in the intervention of psychiatric illnesses with chief complaints of fear of COVID-19 infection. In vivo exposure therapy for fear of COVID-19 infection is not possible due to the risk of virus infection; in this scenario, the VRET provides an immersive experience and can act as adjunctive therapy for treating phobias and anxiety disorders arising due to novel coronavirus pandemic. Clinical presentation and findings as well as management and procedures of VRET are discussed. Medical record of three patients (two male and one female) at the Shenzhen Mental Health Center (Shenzhen Kangning Hospital), China, was included in the present case series. Patients were assessed with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and Fear of COVID-19 Scale to measure anxiety and fear, respectively. Throughout VRET sessions, we gradually and systematically exposed the patient to virtual COVID-19 scenarios (for example, touching stained door handle which may have viruses, watching pandemic news, watching frontline health care workers, etc.). In our study, VRET intervention significantly reduced the related symptoms caused by fear of COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, virtual reality can provide relevant theoretical and practical support for exploring the remote psychological counseling of patients in isolation wards.","Zhang, Wanling; Paudel, Dhirendra; Shi, Rui; Liang, Jie; Liu, Jingwen; Zeng, Xiansheng; Zhou, Yunfei; Zhang, Bin",Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,89,28

Tears and conjunctival secretions were examined for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA. RESULTS: While non-reactive results are strongly correlated to low titre and vice versa, severity showed significant correlation with neither IgA reactivity nor titre. Meanwhile, IgA reactivity did not show significant correlation with either age or sex. The reactivity and IgA titre are correlated with ocular symptoms. CONCLUSION: The anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA could be found in ocular secretions in SARS-CoV-2 patients.

The study collected 425 unique tweets posted by CDC during a 17-week period and constructed a diffusion tree for each unique tweet. Findings indicated that, with respect to message features, perceived efficacy after reading a tweet positively predicted diffusion size of the tweet, whereas perceived susceptibility to a health condition after reading a tweet positively predicted structural virality of the tweet. Perceived negative emotion positively predicted both size and structural virality. With respect to network features, the level of involvement of brokers in diffusing a tweet increased the tweet's structural virality.

The repurposing of existing drugs and recognition of new medicines are continuously in progress. Efforts are being made to single out plant-based novel therapeutic compounds. As a result, some of these biomolecules are in their testing phase. During these efforts, the whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has given the direction to explore the omics systems and approaches to overcome this unprecedented health challenge globally. Genome, proteome, and metagenome sequence analyses have helped identify virus nature, thereby assisting in understanding the molecular mechanism, structural understanding, and disease propagation.

Visitors’ eye movements produced approximately 25,000 fixations and were analysed using linear mixed-effects models. Absolute and area-normalized dwell time analyses yielded mostly non-significant main effects of the environment, indicating similarity of visual exploration patterns between physical and VR settings. One major difference observed was the decrease of average fixation duration in VR, where visitors tended to more rapidly switch focus in this environment with shorter bursts of attentional focus. The experiment demonstrated the ability to compare gaze data between physical and virtual environments as a proxy to measure the similarity of aesthetic experience. Similarity of viewing patterns along with questionnaire results suggested that virtual galleries can be treated as ecologically valid environments that are parallel to physical art galleries.","Gulhan, Doga; Durant, Szonya; Zanker, Johannes M.",Sci Rep,89,1

RDEB is associated with high levels of TGF-β1, which is likely to be involved in the fibrosis that develops in this disease. Endoglin (CD105) is a type III coreceptor for TGF-β1 and its overexpression in fibroblasts deregulates physiological Smad/Alk1/Alk5 signalling, repressing the synthesis of TGF-β1 and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Raloxifene is a specific estrogen receptor modulator designated as an orphan drug for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, a rare vascular disease. Raloxifene stimulates endoglin synthesis, which could attenuate fibrosis. By contrast, the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine may have therapeutic value to rectify inflammation, fibrosis and endothelial dysfunction. Thus, we present here a repurposing strategy based on the molecular and functional screening of fibroblasts from RDEB patients with these drugs, leading us to propose the repositioning of these two well-known drugs currently in clinical use, raloxifene and N-acetylcysteine, to counteract fibrosis and inflammation in RDEB. Both compounds modulate the profibrotic events that may ultimately be responsible for the clinical manifestations in RDEB, suggesting that these findings may also be relevant for other diseases in which fibrosis is an important pathophysiological event.","Aguado, Tania; García, Marta; García, Adela; Ferrer-Mayorga, Gemma; Martínez-Santamaría, Lucía; del Río, Marcela; Botella, Luisa-María; Sánchez-Puelles, José-María",Cells,89,32

Initially considered as deleterious or hazardous substances, the modern era has witnessed the controlled utilization of dangerous poisons in medicine and cosmetics. Simultaneously, antidotes have become crucial as reversal agents to counteract the effects of a poison, and they are also used today to positively cancel the benefits of a poison after use. Currently, the majority of poisons are composed of small molecules. This review focuses on recent developments to reverse or prevent toxic effects of poisons by encapsulation in host molecules. Cyclodextrins, cucurbiturils, acyclic cucurbituril derivatives, calixarenes, and pillararenes, have been reported to largely impact the effects of toxic compounds, thus extending the current paradigm of small molecule antidotes by adding a new family of macrocyclic compounds to the current arsenal of antidotes.

This was a general pattern across countries, but Canada's agricultural trade increased by at least 11%, more than the world aggregate and that of the U.S. This was mostly due to the success of crop exports, specifically in oilseeds, lentils, and cereals. Although some of the increase was due to rising commodity prices, for the most part trade volumes also increased substantially. Not only was Canada's export boom not expected but it was also not closely related to the pandemic. It was due to commodity‐specific circumstances, such as China's rebuilding of its depleted hog herd, a short crop of lentils in India, and demand shifts to Canadian wheat, durum and barley. Increased Asian demand helped this export growth, but accounted for less than a third of it.","Barichello, Richard",Canadian Journal of Agricultural Economics,89,20

By treatment with dansylcadaverine and chlorpromazine and overexpression of a dominant negative form of the Eps15 protein, a clathrin‐mediated endocytosis for productive DENV‐1 internalization into Vero cells was demonstrated whereas the infectious entry of DENV‐2 in the same cell system was independent of clathrin. Treatment with the inhibitors nystatin and methyl‐β‐cyclodextrin, as well as transfection of Vero cells with dominant negative caveolin‐1, had no effect on DENV‐2 virus infection. It was also shown, by using the K44A mutant and the inhibitor dynasore, that dynamin was required for DENV‐2 entry.

The current study examines in depth how the occupational balance of healthcare professionals has changed in the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS The current study has a mixed design, which involves collecting both qualitative and quantitative data. In the first stage of the study, which is the quantitative one, Turkish Occupational Balance Questionnaire (OBQ11-T) was used to collect data, whereas the second stage of the study, which is the qualitative one, was designed to explore occupational balance and the related issues via using semi-structured interviews. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare parameters between the groups (working in active-passive contact with COVID patients). On the other hand, qualitative data were evaluated via consensual qualitative data analysis. RESULTS The level of occupational balance of healthcare professionals included in the study group was found to be significantly lower than the level of occupational balance of healthcare professionals included in the control group (P = .005). Although there was no clear problem in self-care activities of healthcare professionals, the balance between productivity and leisure time activities was disrupted.
