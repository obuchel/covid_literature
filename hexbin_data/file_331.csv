1975,1975,1975,Efficacy of a nonsurgical treatment regimen in patients with bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaws in Saudi Arabia,18.155361,7.478803,2014-02-14,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a nonsurgical treatment regimen in the long-term control of necrotic areas of the jaws and pain in such patients. METHODS: A total of 96 patients suffering from the disease were included in this study. All patients received nonsurgical treatment regimen for 10 days, and repeated every 3 months for 2 years. The size of the osteonecrotic lesions was measured and the pain level was self-assessed with a visual analog scale. RESULTS: The patients showed a statistically significant (F = 16.1; p < .01; r(2) = .95) gradual decrease in the size of exposed bone areas during the nonsurgical therapy (from 12.5 to 8.8 mm). Pain scores ranged from 0 to 3 score scale. Complete resolution of the disease was observed in some patients. CONCLUSIONS: This conservative nonsurgical treatment regimen seems to provide successful treatment in reduction of the sizes of exposed bone areas in the majority of patients.","Alsehimy, Mohammad M",SAGE Open Med,331,22

2331,2331,2331,Ebola virus disease and critical illness,17.843307,10.585914,2016-07-29,"As of 20 May 2016 there have been 28,646 cases and 11,323 deaths resulting from the West African Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak reported to the World Health Organization. There continue to be sporadic flare-ups of EVD cases in West Africa. EVD presentation is nonspecific and characterized initially by onset of fatigue, myalgias, arthralgias, headache, and fever; this is followed several days later by anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Anorexia and gastrointestinal losses lead to dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, and metabolic acidosis, and, in some patients, acute kidney injury. Hypoxia and ventilation failure occurs most often with severe illness and may be exacerbated by substantial fluid requirements for intravascular volume repletion and some degree of systemic capillary leak. Although minor bleeding manifestations are common, hypovolemic and septic shock complicated by multisystem organ dysfunction appear the most frequent causes of death. Males and females have been equally affected, with children (0–14 years of age) accounting for 19 %, young adults (15–44 years) 58 %, and older adults (≥45 years) 23 % of reported cases. While the current case fatality proportion in West Africa is approximately 40 %, it has varied substantially over time (highest near the outbreak onset) according to available resources (40–90 % mortality in West Africa compared to under 20 % in Western Europe and the USA), by age (near universal among neonates and high among older adults), and by Ebola viral load at admission. While there is no Ebola virus-specific therapy proven to be effective in clinical trials, mortality has been dramatically lower among EVD patients managed with supportive intensive care in highly resourced settings, allowing for the avoidance of hypovolemia, correction of electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities, and the provision of oxygen, ventilation, vasopressors, and dialysis when indicated. This experience emphasizes that, in addition to evaluating specific medical treatments, improving the global capacity to provide supportive critical care to patients with EVD may be the greatest opportunity to improve patient outcomes.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of patients with pulmonary metastases (PM) from HCC who had undergone curative PM-ectomy at National Taiwan University Hospital between 1990 and 2004. Univariate (log-rank) and multivariate (Cox’s model) analyses of survival were used to identify the significant prognostic factors. RESULTS: In total, 34 patients were eligible for curative PM-ectomy. The overall survival rates (Kaplan-Meier) after PM-ectomy were 65.2% and 27.5% at 2 and 5 years, respectively. High alpha-fetoprotein level, positive hepatic resection margin, and short disease-free interval (DFI) were unfavorable factors for overall survival from univariate analysis, however, only DFI (P = 0.028) was identified as an independently prognostic factor by multivariate analysis. Bilateral distribution and more PMs were unfavorable factors for PM-free survival from univariate analysis, with only PM number identified as an independent prognostic factor by multivariate analysis (P = 0.017). CONCLUSION: Patients with longer DFIs and fewer PMs can benefit from PM-ectomy in HCC.","Kuo, Shuenn-Wen; Chang, Yih-Leong; Huang, Pei-Ming; Hsu, Hsao-Hsun; Chen, Jin-Shin; Lee, Jang-Ming; Lee, Po-Huang; Lee, Yung-Chie",Ann Surg Oncol,331,8

This invasive procedure is painful for patients; inadequate analgesia may have lasting effects. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends analgesia during all LP procedures, and oral sucrose alone does not offer sufficient analgesia. Our objective was to identify analgesic use trends during infant LP in our emergency department and create a system of analgesic administration. We aimed for complete compliance with one method of analgesia and an increase in our use of 2 or more methods to 85% over 12 months. METHODS: We utilized Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle methodology and retrospective chart review. Five interventions focused on staff communication, collaboration, and education. Inclusion criteria: infants <60 days who underwent LP procedure due to fever >38°C, hypothermia <36.5°C of unknown origin, or ill-appearance. RESULTS: One hundred infant LPs analyzed: 52 preintervention and 48 intervention. The use of one analgesic increased from 98% preintervention to 100%. The use of 2 or more analgesics increased from 58% preintervention to 87%. Topical lidocaine use increased from 56% preintervention to 73%. LP success rates were high in both groups, with no statistically significant change in the success rate. CONCLUSION: We created a streamlined process to ensure all infants undergoing lumbar puncture received at least 1 analgesic and increased the proportion of infants treated with 2 or more analgesics. This work could be expanded to improve analgesia during other invasive procedures in the emergency department.","Balay, Erin E.; Hendrickson, Marissa A.; Harvey, Brian; Dewald, Jennifer; Johnson, Brittany; Louie, Jeffrey",Pediatr Qual Saf,331,1

Here, we present an integrated approach of single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM), computational modeling, and site-specific mass spectrometry (MS) to probe glycan shield structure and behavior at multiple levels. We found that dynamics lead to an extensive network of interglycan interactions that drive the formation of higher-order structure within the glycan shield. This structure defines diffuse boundaries between buried and exposed protein surface and creates a mapping of potentially immunogenic sites on Env. Analysis of Env expressed in different cell lines revealed how cryo-EM can detect subtle changes in glycan occupancy, composition, and dynamics that impact glycan shield structure and epitope accessibility. Importantly, this identified unforeseen changes in the glycan shield of Env obtained from expression in the same cell line used for vaccine production. Finally, by capturing the enzymatic deglycosylation of Env in a time-resolved manner, we found that highly connected glycan clusters are resistant to digestion and help stabilize the prefusion trimer, suggesting the glycan shield may function beyond immune evasion.","Berndsen, Zachary T.; Chakraborty, Srirupa; Wang, Xiaoning; Cottrell, Christopher A.; Torres, Jonathan L.; Diedrich, Jolene K.; López, Cesar A.; Yates, John R.; van Gils, Marit J.; Paulson, James C.; Gnanakaran, Sandrasegaram; Ward, Andrew B.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,331,1

Glycolytic enzymes are crucial molecules for the survival and development of E. granulosus. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular characterization, immunogenicity, tissue distribution and serodiagnostic potential of E. granulosus hexokinase (EgHK), the first key enzyme in the glycolytic pathway. METHODS: EgHK was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Specific serum antibodies were evaluated in mice immunized with recombinant EgHK (rEgHK). The location of EgHK in the larval stage of E. granulosus was determined using fluorescence immunohistochemistry, and the potential of rEgHK as a diagnostic antigen was investigated in patients with CE using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Recombinant EgHK could be identified in the sera of patients with CE and in mouse anti-rEgHK sera. High titers of specific immunoglobulin G were induced in mice after immunization with rEgHK. EgHK was mainly located in the tegument, suckers and hooklets of protoscoleces and in the germinal layer and laminated layer of the cyst wall. The sensitivity and specificity of the rEgHK-ELISA reached 91.3% (42/46) and 87.8% (43/49), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We have characterized the sequence, structure and location of EgHK and investigated the immunoreactivity, immunogenicity and serodiagnostic potential of rEgHK. Our results suggest that EgHK may be a promising candidate for the development of vaccines against E. granulosus and an effective antigen for the diagnosis of human CE.

Hyperventilation and breath-holding are common ventilatory changes that occur around the time of sampling, rapidly altering the ‘true’ status of the blood. This is particularly relevant in emergency medicine patients without permanent arterial catheters, where the pain and anxiety of arterial punctures can cause ventilatory changes. This study aimed to determine whether peripheral venous values could be a more reliable measure of blood gases following acute changes in ventilation. METHODS: To allow for characterisation of ventilatory changes typical of acutely ill patients, but without the confounding influence of perfusion or metabolic disturbances, 30 patients scheduled for elective surgery were studied in a prospective observational study. Following anaesthesia, and before the start of the surgery, ventilator settings were altered to achieve a + 100% or − 60% change in alveolar ventilation (‘hyper-’ or ‘hypoventilation’), changes consistent with the anticipation of a painful arterial puncture commonly encountered in the emergency room. Blood samples were drawn simultaneously from indwelling arterial and peripheral venous catheters at baseline, and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 s following the ventilatory change. Comparisons between the timed arterial (or venous) samples were done using repeated-measures ANOVA, with post-hoc analysis using Bonferroni’s correction. RESULTS: Arterial blood pH and PCO(2) changed rapidly within the first 15–30s after both hyper- and hypoventilation, plateauing at around 60s (∆pH = ±0.036 and ∆PCO(2) = ±0.64 kPa (4.7 mmHg), respectively), with peripheral venous values remaining relatively constant until 60s, and changing minimally thereafter. Mean arterial changes were significantly different at 30s (P < 0.001) when compared to baseline, in response to both hyper- and hypoventilation. CONCLUSION: This study has shown that substantial differences in arterial and peripheral venous acid-base status can be due to acute changes in ventilation, commonly seen in the ER over the 30s necessary to sample arterial blood. If changes are transient, peripheral venous blood may provide a more reliable description of acid-base status.","Shastri, Lisha; Kjærgaard, Søren; Thyrrestrup, Peter S.; Rees, Stephen E.; Thomsen, Lars P.",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,331,33

We present 6 cases of atopic dermatitis (AD), which had stability in their improvement for 1 year or more, under classical homeopathy. The cases were retrospectively assessed with selected based on the Hanifin Rajka atopic dermatitis diagnostic criteria and the follow ups evaluated according to changes on SCORing Atopic Dermatitis scale (SCORAD) scale. The pictures are presented as evidence. Modified Naranjo Criteria for assessing causal attribution of clinical outcome to homeopathic intervention was used to assess the effect of homeopathy in these cases. All the cases improved and stabilised with complete skin clearance (those that relapsed within 1 year were not included). These patients had not suffered high fevers/acute inflammatory diseases since onset/aggravation of AD. Five of the 6 cases developed acute inflammatory diseases as the chronic condition improved. The last case showed return of an old, lesser pathology. The control cases – which were selected for non-improvement under classical homeopathy also showed remarkable skin clearance when there was appearance of acute inflammatory states. In this study, there is a mutually exclusive relationship between efficient acute inflammation and chronic inflammation, which is in accordance with the 2 theories considered here. Further scientific studies are necessary to establish the phenomenon at tissue level.","Mahesh, Seema; Mallappa, Mahesh; Habchi, Olga; Konstanta, Vasiliki; Chise, Cristina; Sykiotou, Panagiota; Vithoulkas, George",Clin Med Insights Case Rep,331,1

The study included 558 nursing students from three different universities in South Korea. Data were collected using structured questionnaires from 2 August to 29 August, 2019. The results show that e-health literacy had a significant direct effect on health-promoting behaviors through the three mediators. Moreover, the overall model explained 46% of the total variance in health-promoting behaviors. Based on these findings, it is necessary to introduce interventions that improve e-health literacy and develop a strategy to promote healthy behaviors. It is also necessary to develop programs to improve e-health literacy competency in nursing students. Moreover, health interventions that improve health-promoting behaviors should be developed, and research to evaluate the effect of the interventions should be conducted.","Kim, Sunghee; Oh, Jihyun",Int J Environ Res Public Health,331,22

Momordica charantia commonly known as bitter gourd has many bioactive compounds with antidiabetic properties. The current study was designed to use computational methods to discover the best antidiabetic peptides devised from hypoglycemic polypeptide-P of M. charantia. The binding affinity and interaction patterns of peptides were evaluated against four receptor proteins (i.e., as agonists of insulin receptor and inhibitors of sodium-glucose cotransporter 1, dipeptidyl peptidase-IV, and glucose transporter 2) using molecular docking approach. A total of thirty-seven peptides were docked against these receptors. Out of which, top five peptides against each receptor were shortlisted based on their S-scores and binding affinities. Finally, the eight best ligands (i.e., LIVA, TSEP, EKAI, LKHA, EALF, VAEK, DFGAS, and EPGGGG) were selected as these ligands strictly followed Lipinski's rule of five and exhibited good ADMET profiling. One peptide EPGGGG showed activity towards insulin and SGLT1 receptor proteins.

Red beans, soya beans, and benny beans were the three samples utilised in this study. This work investigates the appropriate poultry mix for birds breed for meat and egg. Thirty grammes of proteinous feedstock were weighed and homogeneously combined with 70 grammes of maize bran. The following was revealed in a proximate analysis of the feeds: moisture ranged from 1.18% to 1.54%, unrefined lipids 0.99–3.08%, total carbohydrate 57% to 72%, ash content 38.48% to 38.92%, unrefined protein 18.38% to 22.53% and unrefined fiber 2.0% to 4.65% respectively for broilers and layers. In terms of nutritional concentrations, all feed samples showed a substantial variation. Based on the findings of the study, it can be stated that Soya bean-maize bran is an excellent poultry-mix formulation that has deep well-disposed benefits and meets nearly all nutritional needs for meat and egg-producing birds.","Afolabi, Solagbade Saheed; Oyeyode, John Oluwafemi; Shafik, Wasswa; Sunusi, Zubair.

Since these methods assume global smoothness within the image domain, they pose issues for scenarios where local discontinuities are expected, such as the sliding motion between the lungs and the chest wall during the respiratory cycle. Furthermore, an objective function must be optimized for each given pair of images, thus registering multiple sets of images become very time-consuming and scale poorly to higher resolution image volumes. Using recent advances in deep learning, we propose an unsupervised learning-based image registration model. The model is trained over a loss function with a custom regularizer that preserves local discontinuities, while simultaneously respecting the smoothness assumption in homogeneous regions of image volumes.

This study compared outcomes for AA patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) with non-AA patients. METHODS: The MBSAQIP database was reviewed for RYGB and SG patients (2015–2017). Patients were identified as AA or non-AA and grouped to RYGB or SG. Combined and univariate analyses were performed on unmatched/propensity matched populations to assess outcomes. RESULTS: After applying exclusion criteria, 75,409 AA and 354,305 non-AA patients remained. Univariate analysis identified AA-RYGB and AA-SG patients were heavier and younger than non-AA patients. Overall, AA patients tended to have fewer preoperative comorbidities than non-AA patients with the majority of AA comorbidities related to hypertension and renal disease. Analysis of propensity matched data confirmed AA bariatric surgery patients had increased cardiovascular-related disease incidence compared with non-AA patients. Perioperatively, AA-RYGB patients had longer operative times, increased rates of major complications/ICU admission, and increased incidence of 30-day readmission, re-intervention, and reoperation, concomitant with lower rates of minor complications/superficial surgical site infection (SSI) compared with non-AA patients. For SG, AA patients had longer operative times and higher rates of major complications and 30-day readmission, re-intervention, and mortality, coupled with fewer minor complications, superficial/organ space SSI, and leak. CONCLUSION: African American patients undergoing bariatric surgery are younger and heavier than non-AA patients and present with different comorbidity profiles.

To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused millions of people to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. It has been known since the 2003 SARS epidemic that coronaviruses (CoVs) have large RNA genomes, the replication of which requires an RNA-dependent RNA replication/transcription complex. CoV nonstructural proteins (Nsps) play pivotal roles in the assembly of this complex and associated enzymatic functions in virus genomic replication. Several smaller nonenzymatic Nsps assist with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase function. In this study, we determined the structure of SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 9 (nsp9), an RNA-binding protein that is essential for CoV replication. Its homotetrameric structure with two stable dimeric interfaces provids a structural basis for understanding the mechanisms of RNA-binding protein self-assembly, which may be essential for the regulation of viral RNA replication and transcription.","Zhang, Changhui; Chen, Yiping; Li, Li; Yang, Yan; He, Jun; Chen, Cheng; Su, Dan",Mol Biomed,331,16

This disease can be asymptomatic or can affect multiple organ systems. Damage induced by the virus is related to dysfunctional activity of the immune system, but the activity of molecules such as C‐reactive protein (CRP) as a factor capable of inducing an inflammatory status that may be involved in the severe evolution of the disease, has not been extensively evaluated. A systematic review was performed using the NCBI‐PubMed database to find articles related to Covid‐19 immunity, inflammatory response, and CRP published from December 2019 to December 2020. High levels of CRP were found in patients with severe evolution of Covid‐19 in which several organ systems were affected and in patients who died. CRP activates complement, induces the production of pro‐inflammatory cytokines and induces apoptosis which, together with the inflammatory status during the disease, can lead to a severe outcome. Several drugs can decrease the level or block the effect of CRP and might be useful in the treatment of Covid‐19. From this review it is reasonable to conclude that CRP is a factor that can contribute to severe evolution of Covid‐19 and that the use of drugs able to lower CRP levels or block its activity should be evaluated in randomized controlled clinical trials.","Mosquera‐Sulbaran, Jesús A.; Pedreañez, Adriana; Carrero, Yenddy; Callejas, Diana",Rev Med Virol,331,26

Notwithstanding the importance of prior knowledge on corruption extension and experience, research has made little progress in exploring why people condone it, especially in unsuspicious countries, with effective institutions and stable democratic rules and processes. The present study examines this gap in the literature by assessing the European Values Study (EVS) and the Special Eurobarometer (EB) attempts at measuring ‘Tolerance towards Corruption’ (TtC) in OECD countries in Europe during the same period (2017–2019). In the end, measurements proved to be constrained by the limited number of questions/items that try to capture TtC, which gave room to conclude that: (a) EVS and EB approaches do not measure the same TtC. The first measures it through social transgressions not exclusively related to corruption, while the second measures the willingness to accept a public-office corruption when dealing with the public sphere. (b) Lower ages combined with individual preferences/perceptions of less satisfaction with life, widespread corruption, and prior experiences with corruption proved to be more relevant to explain TtC, regardless of the country in which individuals were surveyed. (c) The type of TtC citizens display in advanced democracies proved to be mainly contingent on their age and on the way they interpret the extension of corruption and the prior contact they had with a public-office corruption in a given society.

In this context, large-scale asset purchases are effective because they transfer unwanted risk to the government’s balance sheet.

We focus on the non-energy exchange traded funds (ETFs) as proxies for financial innovations given the potential positive correlation between energy variants and crude oil proxies. We employ a multivariate volatility modeling framework that accounts for important statistical features of the non-energy ETFs and oil price series in the computation of optimal weights and optimal hedging ratios. Results show evidence of hedging effectiveness for the financial innovations against oil market risks, with higher hedging performance observed during the pandemic. Overall, we show that sectoral financial innovations provide resilient investment options. Therefore, we propose that including the ETFs in an investment portfolio containing oil could improve risk-adjusted returns, especially in similar financial crisis as witnessed during the pandemic. In essence, our results are useful for investors in the global oil market seeking to maximize risk-adjusted returns when making investment decisions. Moreover, by exploring the role of structural breaks in the multivariate volatility framework, our attempts at establishing robustness for the results reveal that ignoring the same may lead to wrong conclusions about the hedging effectiveness.","Salisu, Afees A.; Obiora, Kingsley",Financ Innov,331,1

Nevertheless, bacteria continue to evolve new mechanisms to evade this drug-mediated killing with surprising speed on the deployment of each new drug and antibiotic worldwide, a phenomenon called antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Nowadays, AMR represents a critical health threat, for which new medical interventions are urgently needed. By 2050, it is estimated that the leading cause of death will be through untreatable AMR pathogens. Although antibiotics remain a first-line treatment, non-antibiotic therapies such as prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are increasingly interesting alternatives to limit the spread of such antibiotic resistant microorganisms. For the discovery of new vaccines and mAbs, the search for effective antigens that are able to raise protective immune responses is a challenging undertaking. In this context, outer membrane vesicles (OMV) represent a promising approach, as they recapitulate the complete antigen repertoire that occurs on the surface of Gram-negative bacteria. In this review, we present Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as specific examples of key AMR threats caused by Gram-negative bacteria and we discuss the current status of mAbs and vaccine approaches under development as well as how knowledge on OMV could benefit antigen discovery strategies.","Antonelli, Giada; Cappelli, Luigia; Cinelli, Paolo; Cuffaro, Rossella; Manca, Benedetta; Nicchi, Sonia; Tondi, Serena; Vezzani, Giacomo; Viviani, Viola; Delany, Isabel; Scarselli, Maria; Schiavetti, Francesca",Int J Mol Sci,331,26

This has been emphasised during the challenging times of COVID-19. However, their utility for training is countered by the high cost of the equipment, with the most basic simulators costing upwards of £50,000. METHOD: A simple polypectomy simulator model was created using a drain-pipe and surgical gloves. n = 9 junior doctors were timed in their ability to remove the 3 polyps from the simulator. The exercise was repeated over 6 sessions over the course of 3 weeks. Means were compared using ANOVA. RESULTS: There was a mean relative reduction of 75% in overall time taken to complete the task(p < 0.0001). This improvement was seen for both surgical trainees(p = 0.005) and FY1 novices(p < 0.0001) and junior doctors reported feeling more confident with basic Colonoscopic skills. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated an improvement in performance times across both surgical trainees and novices. In today’s era of COVID-19, when direct training opportunities may become more scarce, simple alternatives may become vital in ensuring progression of basic surgical skills such as endoscopy.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is associated with a high mortality rate and recurrent hospitalizations. PURPOSE: To present the first data of the patients using Satelia® Cardio solution METHOD: Satelia® Cardio is a HF patient management solution with a remote monitoring system and a therapeutic guidance by a dedicated-nurse phone platform, supported by the ETAPES Program. The system is accessible from any device and requiring no installation. After the inclusion, the patient is contacted by the nurse, he then receives an SMS alerts following cardiologist prescription (on regular basis), with a link leading to a web page on which he will answer 7 questions and enter his current body weight. Satelia® Cardio algorithm is based on these data inputs, their variability, and the weight. In case of worsening of symptoms, the cardiologist will be notified. Since Covid-19 lockdown, more than 1400 patients have been monitored with the solution. RESULTS: 165 centers (306 cardiologists) are using Satelia® Cardio with 3540 HF patients monitored in the last 29 months. The patients with a mean age of 72 years (19-100) are predominantly males (67%), and mostly NYHA II/III (69%/31%) with a mean LVEF of 40%. The adherence to the system is very good (91%) with 78% of patients still monitored (n = 2787).

Over the period of analysis, the HF patients answered to 163 700 questionnaires, generating 8210 alerts transmitted to the referent cardiologists. CONCLUSION: Patient management solution with a remote monitoring system is key to improving the follow-up of HF patients. The solution Satelia® Cardio is an easy way to use a web application to monitor HF patients, especially on the current period of Covid-19 with a low rate of premature discontinuation. A further step will be to initiate studies to assess the potential benefits for both patients and HCPs of such remote monitoring solution in HF.","Lemieux, H; Picard, F; Barritault, F; Labarre, J; Lafitte, S; Maribas, P; Chaouky, H; Abdennadher, M; Lasserre, R; Amara, W; Pages, N; Nisse-Durgeat, S; Diebold, B",Eur J Prev Cardiol,331,1

We employed the data collection techniques of focus group discussion, community mapping, photovoice, and follow-up small group discussions with 14 African American youth in Cleveland, Ohio. Utilizing participatory thematic analysis, the participants established four main thematic categories connected to the neighborhood which have a strong influence on youth health and well-being. These categories included: (1) Crime and safety; (2) Housing and the built environment; (3) Social Influence; (4) Community Activities. By involving youth as co-constructors of the research, we elicited perspectives on the pathways between a healthy neighborhood to healthy residents, with implications for future research, policy, and intervention programming aimed at improving the health and well-being of children and youth.","Benninger, Elizabeth; Schmidt-Sane, Megan; Spilsbury, James C.",Child Indic Res,331,10

Changes in the practice of bronchoscopy post pandemic: A perspective,18.095312,7.287551,2021-07-20,"Retinal imaging helps to detect retinal and cardiovascular abnormalities. Among these abnormalities, Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) and Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), both are frequent retinal degenerative diseases leading to blindness. Content based retinal OCT scan retrieval process makes use of characteristic features to retrieve similar Optical Coherent Tomography (OCT) scans, index-wise, from a database with minimal human intervention. A number of existing methods take care of segmentation and identification of retinal landmarks and pathologies from OCT volumes. As per the literature survey, till date, no papers are there which deal with the retrieval of retinal OCT scans. In this work, we propose a retrieval system for retinal OCT scans which extracts feature maps of both query and database samples from the layer of deep convolutional neural network and compares for their similarity. The Twin network comparison approach exploits deep features without the resource, space and computation exhaustive network training phase. Most of the techniques involving deep network implementation suffer from the drawbacks of data augmentation and resizing. These requirements have been eliminated automatically as part of the Twin network implementation procedure. The system successfully retrieves retinas with similar symptoms from the database of differently affected and unaffected OCT scans. We evaluated different variations of retrieval performances like AMD-Normal, DME-Normal, AMD-DME, AMD-DME-Normal, etc. Execution time optimization has also been achieved as the network used is comparatively shallow and network training is not required. The system retrieves similar scans from a dataset of abnormal and normal OCT scans with a mean average precision of 0.7571 and mean reciprocal rank of 0.9050. Considering all possible variations of retrieval, we achieved overall mean average precision and mean reciprocal rank of 0.631167 and 0.829607, respectively which are also quite notable with rank thresholds of 3, 5 and 7. Experiments show that the method is noticeably successful in retrieving similar OCT volumes. Per image mean average retrieval time is 8.3 sec. Automatic retrieval of retinal OCT volumes for the presence of a particular ailment can help ophthalmologists in the mass screening process.

Automated group formation requires identifying personal characteristics, designing tasks to probe students’ perceptions, and grouping them to increase individual learning chances. Designers of automated group formation recommendation modules (GFRMs) rarely consider content-specific objectives. We draw on theories on conceptual learning in mathematics and dialogic thinking to emphasize the role of a dialogic gap between students’ voices to enhance individual learning. In an experiment, fifty 8th and 9th grade students solved three mathematical tasks in a pre-intervention-post-set-up: individually, then in dyads, and then individually again. We used a learning analytics system to collect fine-grained content-specific data on students’ responses based on four pre-defined aspects of the parabola concept. We compared students’ answers with those of their peers in order to identify interpersonal relations. The experiment results indicate that students’ thinking about the parabola concept was the most successfully developed when every group member had a different perception of this concept. We illustrate the learning trajectories of four students and elaborate on the learning sequence of one of these students in particular. This article suggests that the centrality of a dialogic gap in developing personal learning is probably content independent. We thus call for software engineers to think about GFRMs that can support content-specific learning and instruction.","Abdu, Rotem; Olsher, Shai; Yerushalmy, Michal",Digit Exp Math Educ,331,16

Nevertheless, most existing studies neglected the core failure mechanism (i.e., spatio-temporal propagation of traffic congestion). In this article, we review existing studies on traffic reliability management and propose a health management framework covering the entire traffic congestion lifetime, from emergence, evolution to dissipation, based on the study of core failure modes with percolation theory. Aiming to be “reliable, invulnerable, resilient, potential, and active”, our proposed traffic health management framework includes modeling, evaluation, diagnosis, and improvement. Our proposed framework may shed light on traffic management for megacities and urban agglomerations around the world.

METHODS We retrospectively measured supply costs, operative time, intra-operative complications, and length of stay in a cohort of 145 patients at a children's hospital who underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy. A standardized preference card for laparoscopic appendectomy was developed and implemented. Data were prospectively collected on 101 consecutive patients and compared to the retrospective cohort using multiple linear regression. A survey assessing the perception of surgeons, nurses and scrub technologists of the impact of standardization on patient safety, patient care, OR efficiency, and cost was conducted. Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to evaluate associations between clinical role and years of experience with the total level of agreement on the survey. RESULTS A 20% average reduction was achieved in supply cost per case, with no significant change in operative time (p=0.14), total time in OR (p=0.15), or length of stay (p=0.60). No intra-operative complications were identified in either group. Survey participants agreed that standardization improves cost and safety. Nurses tended to have greater agreement that standardization improved efficiency and patient care compared to other roles (p=0.06). CONCLUSIONS Standardization of operative equipment can result in a significant cost reduction without impacting quality or delivery of care. Based on average case number per year, a total annual cost savings of >$41,000 could be realized. Survey participants agree that standardization improves cost and patient safety, yet perceptions regarding the impact on efficiency and patient care varied by occupation.","Avansino, Jeffrey R; Goldin, Adam B; Risley, Renelle; Waldhausen, John H T; Sawin, Robert S",Journal of pediatric surgery,331,12

Clinical characteristics of patients in an out-patient rehabilitation program.,17.742445,7.6769,2021-05-06,"AbstractPolymorphic warning signals in aposematic systems are enigmatic because predator learning should favor the most common form, creating positive frequency-dependent survival. However, many populations exhibit variation in warning signals. There are various selective mechanisms that can counter positive frequency-dependent selection and lead to temporal or spatial warning signal diversification. Examining these mechanisms and their effects requires first confirming whether the most common morphs are favored at both local and regional scales. Empirical examples of this are uncommon and often include potentially confounding factors, such as a lack of knowledge of predator identity and behavior. We tested how bird behavior influences the survival of three coexisting morphs of the aposematic wood tiger moth Arctia plantaginis offered to a sympatric predator (great tit Parus major) at different frequencies. We found that although positive frequency-dependent selection is present, its strength is affected by predator characteristics and varying prey profitability. These results highlight the need to understand predator foraging in natural communities with variable prey defenses in order to better examine how behavioral interactions shape evolutionary outcomes.","Gordon, Swanne P; Burdfield-Steel, Emily; Kirvesoja, Jimi; Mappes, Johanna",The American naturalist,331,24

A number of minimally invasive surgical techniques have been introduced as a treatment to prevent glaucoma progressing. Among them, endoscopic cyclophotocoagulation (ECP) is a cyclodestructive procedure developed by Martin Uram in 1992. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ECP in people with open angle glaucoma (OAG) and primary angle closure whose condition is inadequately controlled with drops. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2018, Issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP. The date of the search was 12 July 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of ECP compared to other surgical treatments (other minimally invasive glaucoma device techniques, trabeculectomy), laser treatment or medical treatment. We also planned to include trials where these devices were combined with phacoemulsification compared to phacoemulsification alone. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors planned to independently extract data from reports of included studies using a data collection form and analyse data based on methods expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome was proportion of participants who were drop-free (not using eye drops). Secondary outcomes included mean change in IOP; proportion of participants who achieved an IOP of 21 mmHg or less, 17 mmHg or less or 14 mmHg or less; and proportion of participants experiencing intra- and postoperative complications, We planned to measure all outcomes in the short-term (six to 18 months), medium-term (18 to 36 months), and long-term (36 months onwards). MAIN RESULTS We found one ongoing study that met our inclusion criteria (ChiCTR-TRC-14004233). The study compares combined phacoemulsification with ECP to phacoemulsification alone in people with primary angle closure glaucoma. The primary outcome is intraocular pressure (IOP) and number of IOP-lowering drugs. A total of 50 people have been enrolled. The study started in February 2014 and the trialists have completed recruitment and are in the process of collecting data. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is currently no high-quality evidence for the effects of ECP for OAG and primary angle closure. Properly designed RCTs are needed to assess the medium and long-term efficacy and safety of this technique.","Tóth, Márta; Shah, Anupa; Hu, Kuang; Bunce, Catey; Gazzard, Gus",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,331,6

Accumulating experience in LC has resulted in an increasing number of investigators reporting that LC can be safely performed in cirrhotic patients. The aim of this study was to report the efficacy and safety of LC in the treatment of symptomatic cholelithiasis in cirrhotic patients, and a review of the literature in the matter. METHODS Between January 2006 and July 2010, from 503 patients under LC, we reviewed 43 cirrhotic patients of Child-Pugh Classification A, B, and C, with symptomatic gallstones. RESULTS Conversion to an open procedure was necessary in 5 patients due to multiple factors. The mean operative time and length of hospital stay were significantly longer and higher in cirrhotic group (P<0.05). Postoperative complications were observed in 37.2% of patients. Trocar site hematoma (P=0.02), wound complications (P=0.02), and intra-abdominal collection (P=0.01) occurred more frequently in patients with cirrhosis (Child B and C class) than in patients without cirrhosis. One case of continuing hemorrhage from the gallbladder bed required a reoperation for hemostasis. Two patients with Child-Pugh class C and 1 patient with class B cirrhosis developed ascites after surgery; 1 patient with Child-Pugh class A had bile leakage. No deaths occurred. CONCLUSIONS LC is an effective and safe procedure and should be the treatment of choice for symptomatic cholelithiasis or cholecystitis in patients with compensated cirrhosis.","Lledó, Jose Bueno; Ibañez, Jose C; Mayor, Lucas García; Juan, Manuel B","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",331,1

We observe that Treg frequencies increase with nodal invasion, and that Tregs express higher levels of co-inhibitory/stimulatory receptors than effector cells. Also, while Tregs show conserved suppressive function in TDLN and tumor, conventional T cells (Tconvs) in TDLNs proliferate and produce Th1-inflammatory cytokines, but are dysfunctional in the tumor. We describe a common transcriptomic signature shared by Tregs from tumors and nodes, including CD80, which is significantly associated with poor patient survival.

There are few preclinical animal models to evaluate these strategies. Here we report on a model to simultaneously evaluate both of these treatment approaches. METHODS Allogeneic clot was injected through the 6 F guide catheter after creating >50% luminal stenosis of the common carotid arteries of New Zealand White rabbits. The stenosis was released after 1 h, allowing sufficient time for clot-vessel wall interaction. Occlusion was confirmed and each vessel was assigned to receive either balloon angioplasty alone, intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator (tPA, Alteplase, Genentech, San Francisco, California, USA), tPA delivery through prototype balloon infusion wire (NIT Therapeutics, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA), partial stent deployment or partial stent deployment with locally delivered tPA. The negative control received no treatment. RESULTS In vivo revascularization Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score revealed that the balloon infusion wire achieved a stable and higher revascularization score of TICI 2B, with a lower dose of tPA in comparison with other treatment strategies. All treatment strategies resulted in endothelial denudation and exposure of the internal elastic lamina. CONCLUSIONS The proposed animal model permits reliable and consistent thromboembolic occlusion of the target vasculature and allows for an assessment of both pharmacologic and mechanical revascularization strategies for acute ischemic stroke.","Gounis, Matthew J; Nogueira, Raul G; Mehra, Manik; Chueh, Juyu; Wakhloo, Ajay K",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,331,31
70545,70545,70545,Multiple Rib Fractures in Severe Kyphoscoliosis: A Question Mark Spine.,17.862535,7.244742,2020,"BACKGROUND On February 26, 2020, the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was detected in Israel. The Ministry of Health (MoH) instructed people to take isolation measures and restrict their movement. Similarly, there was a gradual decrease in the number of visits to our emergency department (ED). OBJECTIVES To describe the decline in the referrals to the ED and in-hospital beds occupancy during the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare it to the H1N1 2009 pandemic. METHODS Employing a cross-sectional epidemiologic study, the pattern of visits to the ED during the COVID-19 was compared with the pattern of visits during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, as well as a year without a pandemic. The data was adjusted to consider changes in population size. The Welch t test for unpaired, unequal samples was used to analyze the data. RESULTS Within 2 months of the COVID-19 outbreak, the average number of visits to the ED dropped by 30.2% and the hospital occupancy by 29.2% (a minimum of 57%), compared to the same period, the year before. In comparison to the same period during the H1N1 outbreak, we witnessed a significant decline in the number of visits to the ED during the COVID-19 outbreak. CONCLUSION The behavior of people during the COVID-19 pandemic was different from their behavior during the H1N1 pandemic. People seemed to avoid visiting the ED. The boundary between precaution and panic in the generation of the media could be very thin. Decision-makers must take this into account.","Basis, Fuad; Zeidani, Hisam; Hussein, Khetam; Hareli, Shlomo",International journal of health policy and management,331,33

His rule adds nine months and seven days to the first day of the last menstrual period. The expected date of confinement from this formula is approximately right in the majority of cases. However, the idea that this rule can apply to every pregnant female - young or old, nulliparous or multigravida, Caucasian, Asian, African, or Indigenous - stretches credulity. In addition, many women regard the 40-week date as a deadline, which if crossed, may then place the baby under stress. Forty weeks is such a simple, round, convenient figure that it has proved difficult to challenge, despite criticism. Nonetheless, what might have been an appropriate formula in Germany in the 19th century deserves to be revisited in the 21st. AIMS To review the length of pregnancy, in the light of current technology, in particular ultrasound scanning, and assisted reproductive techniques. MATERIAL AND METHODS A Medline search was performed for variables on the length of pregnancy, the expected date of confinement, and prolonged pregnancy. RESULTS A number of factors were found to significantly influence the length of a pregnancy, including ethnicity, height, variations in the menstrual cycle, the timing of ovulation, parity and maternal weight. CONCLUSIONS Naegele's rule should be considered as a guideline for the expected date of confinement, and not a definite date.","Lawson, Gerald Wightman",The Australian & New Zealand journal of obstetrics & gynaecology,331,20

Despite it being highly preventable, hypertension is responsible for a significant proportion of global morbidity and mortality. Common methods for controlling hypertension include prescribing anti-hypertensive medication, a pharmacological approach, and increasing physical activity, a behavioural approach. In general, little is known about the comparative effectiveness of pharmacological and behavioural approaches for reducing blood pressure in hypertension. A previous network meta-analysis suggested that physical activity interventions may be just as effective as many anti-hypertensive medications in preventing mortality; however, this analysis did not provide the comparative effectiveness of these disparate modes of intervention on blood pressure reduction. The primary objective of this study is to use network meta-analysis to compare the relative effectiveness, for blood pressure reduction, of different approaches to increasing physical activity and different first-line anti-hypertensive therapies in people with hypertension. METHODS A systematic review will be conducted to identify studies involving randomised controlled trials which compare different types of physical activity interventions and first-line anti-hypertensive therapy interventions to each other or to other comparators (e.g. placebo, usual care) where blood pressure reduction is the primary outcome. We will search the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and PsycInfo. For studies which meet our inclusion criteria, two reviewers will extract data independently and assess the quality of the literature using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Network meta-analyses will be conducted to generate estimates of comparative effectiveness of each intervention class and rankings of their effectiveness, in terms of reduction of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. DISCUSSION This study will provide evidence regarding the comparability of two common first-line treatment options for people with hypertension. It will also describe the extent to which there is direct evidence regarding the comparative effectiveness of increasing physical activity and initiating anti-hypertensive therapy.

STUDY DESIGN Experimental study. ANIMALS Adult Beagle dogs (n = 5). METHODS Gelatin sponge particles (GSPs) were injected through a microcatheter for selective embolization of the left hepatic artery in normal dogs. Computed tomography (CT) and histology were performed during an 8-week observation period; biochemical analysis data were obtained during a 12-week observation period after TAE. RESULTS Embolization was successful in all dogs and did not induce any change in the clinical appearance of dogs. Postoperative CT was consistent with recanalization of the artery within 2 weeks of embolization in all dogs. Hepatic enzyme levels increased temporarily after embolization but gradually returned to normal ranges. Histological examinations did not differ between treated and untreated liver tissues. CONCLUSION TAE appears safe in normal dogs observed for 12 weeks. Arterial recanalization seems to occur within 2 weeks after injection of GSPs in the left hepatic artery. IMPACT/CLINICAL RELEVANCE Selective TAE of the hepatic artery was well tolerated in normal dogs. Selective TAE may be applicable to canine hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Oishi, Yasuhisa; Tani, Kenji; Ozono, Koushiro; Itamoto, Kazuhito; Haraguchi, Tomoya; Taura, Yasuho",Veterinary surgery : VS,331,0

Many studies have indicated the need for evidence to find the most effective skin care protocol to reduce the incidence and severity of IAD in critically ill patients. Aim and objective To develop a need-based interventional skin care protocol on IAD after identifying the risk of developing IAD in critically ill patients and by assessing the nurse's knowledge and practice on IAD. Materials and methods Quantitative research approach with an exploratory research design was adopted in the study. A total of 40 staff nurses and 100 patients were included. To assess the knowledge of staff nurses regarding IAD, a knowledge questionnaire was administered and the IAD prevention practice among staff nurses was assessed with the help of an observation checklist. The risk of IAD among 100 critically ill patients was observed by the investigator, using a perineal risk assessment tool. The obtained data were analyzed by using descriptive and inferential statistics. The protocol was developed by the researcher and it was validated by 5 experts. Results The results revealed that most of patients (60%) had a high risk for development of IAD. Most of the nurses had poor knowledge (40%) and had poor practice in assessment, perineal area, and prevention of infection area. Hence considering all these aspects, a protocol was developed. Conclusion The researchers developed a need-based skin care protocol to decrease the development of IAD. How to cite this article Sharma P, Latha S, Sharma RK.

This study explores the ability of (111)In-bevacizumab scintigraphy to depict RCC and to evaluate response to neoadjuvant treatment with sorafenib, a VEGF receptor inhibitor. METHODS The ability to depict RCC with (111)In-bevacizumab scintigraphy was tested in 14 patients scheduled to undergo a tumor nephrectomy; of these, 9 RCC patients were treated in a neoadjuvant setting with sorafenib (400 mg orally twice a day). In the latter group, baseline and posttreatment (111)In-bevacizumab scans were compared. The intratumoral distribution of (111)In-bevacizumab was determined scintigraphically ex vivo in a 1-cm lamella of the resected tumorous kidney. Expression of VEGF-A, glucose transporter-1, carbonic anhydrase IX, α-smooth-muscle actin, and Ki67 was determined by immunohistochemistry and compared with the local concentration of (111)In-bevacizumab. Additionally, the VEGF-A content in tumor samples was determined quantitatively by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS In all 5 non-neoadjuvant-treated patients, preferential accumulation of (111)In-bevacizumab was observed in the tumors. All ccRCC lesions with enhanced (111)In-bevacizumab targeting expressed high levels of VEGF-A. Treatment with sorafenib resulted in a significant decrease of (111)In-bevacizumab uptake in the tumor in the patients with ccRCC (mean change, -60.5%; range, +1.5% to -90.1%). The decrease in uptake was due to destruction of the tumor neovasculature, whereas the VEGF-A expression remained intact. In the patient with papillary RCC, limited uptake without change after sorafenib was observed. CONCLUSION RCC lesions were clearly delineated with (111)In-bevacizumab scintigraphy. Neoadjuvant treatment with sorafenib resulted in a significant decrease of (111)In-bevacizumab uptake in RCC. (111)In-bevacizumab scintigraphy can be an attractive biomarker for response and needs further study.","Desar, Ingrid M E; Stillebroer, Alexander B; Oosterwijk, Egbert; Leenders, William P J; van Herpen, Carla M L; van der Graaf, Winette T A; Boerman, Otto C; Mulders, Peter F A; Oyen, Wim J G","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",331,1

One such training intervention is simulation-based training that emphasises learning actual tasks through experimentation in a risk-free environment without negative patient outcomes. EHR-specific simulation-based training can be employed to improve EHR use, thereby enhancing healthcare providers' skills and behaviours. Despite the potential advantages of this type of training, no study has identified and mapped the available evidence. To fill that gap, this scoping review will synthesise the current state of literature on EHR simulation-based training. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The Arksey and O'Malley methodological framework will be employed. Three databases (PubMed, Embase and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) will be searched for published articles. ProQuest and Google Scholar will be searched to identify unpublished articles. Databases will be searched from inception to 29 January 2020. Only articles written in English, randomised control trials, cohort studies, cross-sectional studies and case-control studies will be considered for inclusion. Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Then, they will review full texts to determine articles for final inclusion. Citation chaining will be conducted to manually screen references of all included studies to identify additional studies not found by the search. A data abstraction form with relevant characteristics will be developed to help address the research question. Descriptive numerical analysis will be used to describe characteristics of included studies. Based on the extracted data, research evidence of EHR simulation-based training will be synthesised.

As sleep problems may persist and hurt health, it is important to identify which populations have experienced changes in sleeping patterns during the pandemic and their extent. METHODS In Study 1, 3,062 responders from 49 countries accessed the survey website voluntarily between March 26-April 26, 2020, and 2,562 (84%; age: 45.2±14.5, 68% women) completed the study. In Study 2, 1,022 adult US responders were recruited for pay through Mechanical Turk, and 971 (95%; age 40.4±13.6, 52% women) completed the study. The survey tool included demographics and items adapted from validated sleep questionnaires on sleep duration, quality and timing, and sleeping pills consumption. RESULTS In Study 1, 58% of the responders were unsatisfied with their sleep. Forty percent of the responders reported a decreased sleep quality vs. before COVID-19 crisis. Self-reported sleeping pill consumption increased by 20% (p<0.001). Multivariable analysis indicated that female sex, being in quarantine, 31 to 45-year age group, reduced physical activity and adverse impact on livelihood were independently associated with more severe worsening of sleep quality during the pandemic. The majority of findings were reproduced in the independent cohort of Study 2. CONCLUSIONS Changes imposed due to the pandemic have led to a surge in individuals reporting sleep problems across the globe. The findings raise the need to screen for worsening sleep patterns and use of sleeping aids, especially in more susceptible populations, namely, women and people with insecure livelihoods subjected to social isolation.","Mandelkorn, Uri; Genzer, Shir; Choshen-Hillel, Shoham; Reiter, Joel; Meira E Cruz, Miguel; Hochner, Hagit; Kheirandish-Gozal, Leila; Gozal, David; Gileles-Hillel, Alex",Journal of clinical sleep medicine : JCSM : official publication of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine,331,1

Within fragile health systems that lack PC, incurable illness is often marked by pain and suffering, as well as burdensome costs. In high-income settings, PC decreases healthcare utilisation, thus enhancing value. Similar cost-effectiveness models are lacking in low-income and middle-income countries and with them, the impetus and funding to expand PC delivery. METHODS We conducted a systematic search of seven databases to gather evidence of the cost-effectiveness of PC in low-income and middle-income countries. We extracted and synthesised palliative outcomes and economic data from original research studies occurring in low-income and middle-income countries. This review adheres to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and includes a quality appraisal. RESULTS Our search identified 10 eligible papers that included palliative and economic outcomes in low-income and middle-income countries. Four provided true cost-effectiveness analyses in comparing the costs of PC versus alternative care, with PC offering cost savings, favourable palliative outcomes and positive patient-reported and family-reported outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Despite the small number of included studies, wide variety of study types and lack of high-quality studies, several patterns emerged: (1) low-cost PC delivery in low-income and middle-income countries is possible, (2) patient-reported outcomes are favourable and (3) PC is less costly than the alternative. This review highlights the extraordinary need for robust cost-effectiveness analysis of PC in low-income and middle-income countries in order to develop health economic models for the delivery of PC, direct resource allocation and guide healthcare policy for PC delivery in low-income and middle-income countries.","Reid, Eleanor Anderson; Kovalerchik, Olga; Jubanyik, Karen; Brown, Stuart; Hersey, Denise; Grant, Liz",BMJ supportive & palliative care,331,1

The significance of each pathogenetic component of no-reflow is suggested to be different in different patients, which may warrant an individualized approach in the treatment.","Zhuravlev, A S; Azarov, A V; Semitko, S P; Ioseliani, D G",Kardiologiia,331,12

FST-loaded nanoparticles were prepared with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) by the interfacial deposition method. A central composite design of two independent variables, the concentration of PVA and the amount of PLGA, was applied for the optimization of the preparative parameter. The responses, including average particle size, polydispersity index, encapsulation efficiency, and zeta potential, were assessed. The optimized formulation possessed a mean particle size of 187.9 nm, the polydispersity index of 0.121, encapsulation efficiency of 79.3%, and zeta potential of -29.2 mV. The morphological observation demonstrated a globular shape for particles. Differential scanning calorimetry and powder X-ray diffraction studies confirmed that the encapsulated FST was presented as the amorphous state. The dissolution test indicated a 3.06-fold increase for the accumulating concentrations, and the everted gut sac test showed a 4.9-fold gain for permeability at the duodenum region. In conclusion, the optimized FST-loaded nanoparticle formulation in this work can be developed as an efficient oral delivery system of FST to improve its biopharmaceutic properties.","Liu, Wan-Yi; Lin, Chia-Chen; Hsieh, Yun-Shan; Wu, Yu-Tse",Molecules,331,19

However, there is a lack of evidence on the impact of the pandemic on functional prognosis. The aim of this study is to analyse the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the 3-month functional outcomes of patients hospitalised due to acute ischaemic stroke in Aragon (Spain). MATERIL AND METHODS We reviewed the data of all patients admitted due to ischaemic stroke to any hospital in our regional healthcare system between 30 December 2019 and 3 May 2020. We compared modified Rankin Scale scores and mortality at 3 months in patients hospitalised before and after the declaration of a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS In total, 318 patients with acute ischaemic stroke met our inclusion criteria. No differences were observed between periods in global or specific characteristics, with the exception of a higher proportion of patients older than 80 years during the first period (42.2% vs. 29.0%, P=.028). In the comparative analysis, we found no significant differences in mortality (12.3 vs. 7.9, P=.465) or in the proportion of patients with modified Rankin Scale scores ≤ 2 (57.7% vs. 57.1%, P=.425) at 3 months. CONCLUSION To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyse the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the 3-month functional outcomes of patients with ischaemic stroke. In our region, there has been no increase in rates of mortality or disability at 3 months in patients admitted due to ischaemic stroke during the pandemic.","Tejada Meza, H; Lambea Gil, Á; Villar Yus, C; Pérez Lázaro, C; Navarro Pérez, M P; Campello Morer, I; Giménez Muñoz, Á; Artal Roy, J; Alberti González, O; Hernando Quintana, N; Ruiz Palomino, P; Crespo Burillo, J A; García Arguedas, C; Ballester Marco, L; Palacin Larroy, M; Seral Moral, M; Marta Moreno, J",Neurologia,331,16

Most of the health system capacity has been directed to COVID-19 patients, and routine outpatient clinics have been suspended. Chronic disease patients, such as inherited metabolic disorders (IMD), have had trouble accessing healthcare services. Methods An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among patients with IMDs who were present for a follow-up at our clinic to address their problems during pandemic period. Our clinic's Instagram and Facebook accounts were used to invite the participants. Three reminders were given between May 1, 2020, and May 30, 2020. Survey questions were analyzed using descriptive statics. Results A total of 213 patients completed our survey. Incomplete surveys were excluded, and 175 questionnaires were evaluated. Most of patients had a special diet, and 51% of them had some difficulty with their diet. The reported rate of using a special treatment was 38%, and most of these patients (91%) had no problem receiving these special therapies during this time. Parents who were wearing masks while caring for their child were very few (17%), but a vast majority of parents (73.7%) had high handwashing rates. None of the patients had a SARS-COV2 infection until this paper was written. Conclusion This is the first study that aims to determine the problems faced by patients with IMD during the COVİD-19 period. Considering that the pandemic will not immediately pass, recognizing the problems faced by patients with chronic diseases and developing solutions would help these patients avoid long-term damage.","Oge Enver, Ece; Hopurcuoglu, Duhan; Ahmadzada, Seffa; Zubarioglu, Tanyel; Aktuglu Zeybek, Ayşe Cigdem; Kiykim, Ertugrul",Journal of pediatric endocrinology & metabolism : JPEM,331,12

PARTICIPANTS The four sites of this cohort are in northern (Ballabgarh), southern (Chennai), eastern (Kolkata) and western (Pune) parts of India. We enrolled 5336 participants across 4220 households and began surveillance in July 2018 for viral respiratory infections with additional participants enrolled annually. Trained field workers collected data about individual-level and household-level risk factors at enrolment and quarterly assessed frailty and grip strength. Trained nurses surveilled weekly to identify acute respiratory infections (ARI) and clinically assessed individuals to diagnose acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) as per protocol. Nasal and oropharyngeal swabs are collected from all ALRI cases and one-fifth of the other ARI cases for laboratory testing. Cost data of the episode are collected using the WHO approach for estimating the economic burden of seasonal influenza. Handheld tablets with Open Data Kit platform were used for data collection. FINDINGS TO DATE The attrition of 352 participants due to migration and deaths was offset by enrolling 680 new entrants in the second year. All four sites reported negligible influenza vaccination uptake (0.1%-0.4%), low health insurance coverage (0.4%-22%) and high tobacco use (19%-52%). Ballabgarh had the highest proportion (54.4%) of households in the richest wealth quintile, but reported high solid fuel use (92%). Frailty levels were highest in Kolkata (11.3%) and lowest in Pune (6.8%). The Chennai cohort had highest self-reported morbidity (90.1%). FUTURE PLANS The findings of this cohort will be used to inform prioritisation of strategies for influenza and RSV control for older adults in India. We also plan to conduct epidemiological studies of SARS-CoV-2 using this platform.","Krishnan, Anand; Dar, Lalit; Amarchand, Ritvik; Prabhakaran, Aslesh Ottapura; Kumar, Rakesh; Rajkumar, Prabu; Kanungo, Suman; Bhardwaj, Sumit Dutt; Choudekar, Avinash; Potdar, Varsha; Chakrabarti, Alok Kumar; Kumar, Cp Girish; Parameswaran, Giridara Gopal; Dhakad, Shivram; Manna, Byomkesh; Choudhary, Ashish; Lafond, Kathryn E; Azziz-Baumgartner, Eduardo; Saha, Siddhartha",BMJ open,331,27

When applied systematically, 7,8-DHF can pass through blood-brain barrier and exhibit potential therapeutic effects in several animal models of neurodegenerative disorders. This study investigates the remedial effects of 7,8-DHF on behavioral impairments and biochemical changes associated with aging with a species emphasis on cortex. For this purpose three experimental groups were formed which are young control group, old group and old-DHF groups. 5 mg/kg 7,8-DHF was administered intraperitoneally to old-DHF group for 3 weeks. We assessed the hang wire and adhesive removal performances of mice. Also, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and synaptic protein levels in the cortex were measured. We observed that chronic administration of 7,8-DHF improved behavioral performance of old mice. Besides, 7,8-DHF reversed MDA level which was increased in old control animals. However, 3 weeks application of 7,8-DHF failed to recover the levels of neuroinflammation markers (TNF-α and IL-6) and synaptic proteins (PSD-95 and Synaptophysin) which were reduced in old group. These findings demonstrate that improvement of age-dependent behavioral impairments and MDA levels by 7,8-DHF could be attributed to its antioxidant actions.","Keser, Hatice; Doğramacı, Şeniz; Şahin, Elif; Sağlam, Neslihan; Erdem, Mehmet; Alver, Ahmet; Aydin-Abidin, Selcen",General physiology and biophysics,331,1

Here we present a comprehensive analysis of the biogeography and ecophysiology of a widely distributed NCD, Gamma4. Gamma4 was the most abundant Gammaproteobacterial NCD along transects across the subtropical North Pacific. Using quantitative PCR, Gamma4 was detectable throughout the surface waters of North Pacific (7°N-55°N, 138°E-80°W), whereas GammaA was detected at <2/3 of the stations. Gamma4 was abundant during autumn-winter and positively correlated with chlorophyll a, while GammaA thrived during spring-summer and was positively correlated with temperature. Environmental clones affiliated with Gamma4 were widely detected in pelagic waters, oxygen minimum zones and even dinoflagellate microbiomes. By analysing the metabolic potential of a genome of Gamma4 reconstructed from the Tara Oceans dataset, we suggest that Gamma4 is a versatile heterotrophic NCD equipped with multiple strategies in scavenging phosphate (and iron) and for respiratory protection of nitrogenase. The transcription of nitrogenase genes is putatively regulated by Fnr-NifL-NifA and GlnD-GlnK systems that respond to intracellular oxygen and glutamate concentration. These results provide important implications for the potential life strategies of pelagic NCDs.","Cheung, Shunyan; Zehr, Jonathan P; Xia, Xiaomin; Tsurumoto, Chihiro; Endo, Hisashi; Nakaoka, Shin-Ichiro; Mak, Wingkwan; Suzuki, Koji; Liu, Hongbin",Environmental microbiology,331,1

Pre-transplant risk assessment can include many factors, but there is no clear consensus on which parameters to take into account, and their relative importance. In general younger patients are known to be at higher risk for acute rejection, compounded by higher rates of non-adherence in adolescents. Donor age and recipient gender do not appear to exert a meaningful effect on risk of rejection per se, but black recipient ethnicity remains a well-established risk factor even under modern immunosuppression regimens. Little difference in risk is now observed between deceased- and living-donor recipients. Immunological risk assessment has developed substantially in recent years. Cross-match testing with cytotoxic analysis has long been supplemented by flow cytometry, but development of solid-phase single-bead antigen testing of solubilized human leukocyte antigens (HLA) to detect donor-specific antibodies (DSA) permits a far more nuanced stratification of immunological risk status, including the different classes and intensities of HLA antibodies Class I and/or II, including HLA-DSA. Immunologic risk evaluation is now often based on a combination of these tests, but other assessments are becoming more widely introduced, such as measurement of non-HLA antibodies against angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptors or T-cell ELISPOT assay of alloantigen-specific donor. Targeted densensitization protocols can improve immunological risk, notably for DSA-positive patients with negative cytotoxicity and flow cross-match. HLA mismatch remains an important and undisputed risk factor for rejection. Delayed graft function also increases the risk of subsequent acute rejection, and the early regimen can be modified in such cases. Overall, there is a shift towards planning the immunosuppressive regimen based on pre-transplant immunology testing although certain conventional risk factors retain their importance.","Pratschke, Johann; Dragun, Duska; Hauser, Ingeborg A; Horn, Sabine; Mueller, Thomas F; Schemmer, Peter; Thaiss, Friedrich",Transplantation reviews,331,16

Lithium inhibits inositol monophosphatase (IMPase), a probable key therapeutic mechanism. The anti-inflammatory drug, ebselen, also inhibits IMPase and appears well-tolerated and safe. OBJECTIVES To assess the efficacy of adjunctive ebselen in mania using the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) (primary outcome) and the Altman Self-Rating Mania (ASRM) Scale and Clinical Global Impression-Severity Scale (CGI-S) among the secondary outcomes. METHODS Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial conducted between October 2017 and June 2019, at Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust. Pharmacy-controlled randomisation was computer-generated, with full allocation concealment. In/outpatients (n = 68) aged 18-70, experiencing mania or hypomania, were assigned to 3 weeks ebselen (600 mg bd) (n = 33) or placebo (n = 35). Participants received usual clinical care and psychotropic medication. RESULTS Ebselen was numerically, but not statistically, superior to placebo in lowering scores on the YMRS (adjusted mean difference and 95% confidence interval, - 1.71 (- 5.34 to 1.91), p = 0.35) and ASRM (- 1.36 (- 3.75 to 1.17), p = 0.29). However, scores on the CGI-S were significantly lower at week 3 in ebselen-treated participants (adjusted mean difference, - 0.58 (- 1.14 to - 0.03), p = 0.04). A post hoc analysis excluding patients taking concomitant valproate treatment magnified the difference between ebselen and placebo on the YMRS. Adverse events were comparable between groups, and mild. CONCLUSIONS Ebselen merits further investigation where concomitant psychotropic medication is better controlled and participants taking valproate are excluded. If effective, ebselen's superior tolerance and safety could make it a useful alternative to lithium.

Our study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of RF ablation, administered with either multitined expandable electrodes or with internally cooled cluster electrodes, in the treatment of large (≥10 cm diameter) hepatic hemangiomas. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed our sequential experience of treating 43 large hepatic hemangiomas in 42 patients with RF ablation/multitined expandable electrodes or with RF ablation/internally cooled electrodes. Twenty-two hemangiomas in 21 patients were treated with expandable electrode (multitined electrode group), and 21 hemangiomas in 21 patients were treated with internally cooled cluster electrode (internally cooled electrode group). RESULTS Among the 43 large hepatic hemangiomas, 27 subcapsular lesions were treated by a laparoscopic approach, and 16 lesions located in liver parenchyma were treated by a computed tomography-guided percutaneous approach. In the multitined electrode group, RF ablation treatment was performed in all 21 patients in 1 session. In the internally cooled electrode group, 18 patients were treated by RF ablation in 1 session, and 3 patients, with ≥14.0-cm single hemangioma, were treated with RF ablation in 2 sessions. Complete ablation was achieved in 81.8% (18/22) and 90.5% (19/21) in the multitined electrode group and the internally cooled electrode group, respectively (P>0.05). Ablation time for single hemangioma was shorter with the internally cooled electrode than with the multitined electrode (P<0.05). There were 79 complications related to ablation (2 major and 77 minor) in 31 patients. All 21 patients in the multitined electrode group experienced complications, compared with 10 of 21 patients (47.6%) in the internally cooled electrode group (P<0.05). Both of the 2 major complications occurred in the multitined electrode group. All the complications were treated successfully with conservative measures. CONCLUSIONS RF ablation is a safe and effective treatment for large hepatic hemangiomas. Use of the internally cooled cluster electrodes and a more defensive treatment algorithm can reduce the complications.","Gao, Jun; Ding, Xuemei; Ke, Shan; Xin, Zonghai; Ning, Chunmin; Sha, Qi; Sun, Wenbing",Journal of clinical gastroenterology,331,4

To date, however, no study has correlated histologic findings of intestinal injury with the OPTN criteria. We aimed to describe histopathologic and molecular features of allograft injury in relation to donor conditions defined by the OPTN criteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS Graft histology (Park Score), Claudin-3 staining, systemic inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein/lipopolysaccharide-binding protein) and expression of heat shock protein 70, heme oxygenase 1, and interleukin 6 were evaluated in multiorgan deceased donors (donation after brain death [DBD] and donation after cardiac death [DCD]). RESULTS Ninety-seven samples (52 jejunum/45 ileum) were recovered from 59 donors (46 DBD/13 DCD). The OPTN criterion cold ischemia time correlated with histologic injury (Park score) to which the jejunum appeared more susceptible than the ileum. Claudin-3 staining was higher, and heat shock protein 70 expression lower in donors meeting the OPTN criteria compared with donors not meeting the criteria and in DBD versus DCD. In DBD donors, interleukin 6 expression was higher compared with DCD donors and inversely related to C-reactive protein. CONCLUSIONS Our multiparameter analysis suggests that the OPTN criteria can be discriminative concerning intestinal graft quality. Our data suggest that DCD intestinal allografts are qualitatively inferior and that the jejunum is more sensitive to ischemia than the ileum.","Roskott, Anne Margot C; van Haaften, Wouter T; Leuvenink, Henri G D; Ploeg, Rutger J; van Goor, Harry; Blokzijl, Tjasso; Ottens, Petra J; Dijkstra, Gerard; Nieuwenhuijs, Vincent B",The Journal of surgical research,331,23

METHODS 374 patients undergoing isolated aortic valve replacements were identified between 2015 and 2017. Patients with preoperative heart block, patients undergoing concomitant MAZE procedure and those undergoing multivalve procedures were excluded. Interrupted technique was performed with multiple non-pledgeted sutures. Running technique was performed with three 2-0 polypropylene sutures. Propensity-score matching (caliper distance = 0.10) was used to match based on patient age, gender, BMI, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, heart failure, arrythmias, use of anti-arrhythmics, and STS PROM. RESULTS Propensity score matching yielded 103 pairs of running technique and interrupted technique patients for analysis. Within the propensity score-matched cohort, there were no differences in sustained complete heart block and need for pacemaker, 4 (3.8%) for running technique vs 3 (2.9%) for interrupted technique (p = 0.307). At 4 weeks, there was no difference in mean prosthetic aortic valve gradients calculated on transthoracic echocardiogram (6.39 ± 2.47 mmHg vs 6.46 ± 2.86, p = 0.850). There was no difference in paravalvular leak (0 (0%) vs 2 (1.9%), p = 0.070). CONCLUSIONS Surgical implantation of a prosthetic aortic valve may be performed with a running suture technique without any significant increase in risk of heart block, need for permanent pacemaker or paravalvular leak. Long-term data will be critical to evaluate any development of paravalvular leaks in the future.","Sultan, Ibrahim; Dufendach, Keith A; Kilic, Arman; Bianco, Valentino; Navid, Forozan; Gleason, Thomas G",General thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,331,8

For patients with more severe symptoms, initial treatment with long acting β2-agonists and long-acting muscarinic antagonists combination therapy is recommended. Tiotropium + olodaterol fixed-dose combination (Tio+Olo FDC) is an aqueous solution of tiotropium bromide and olodaterol delivered by the RESPIMAT® Soft MistTM inhaler for patients with moderate to very severe COPD. METHODS This single site, open-label, phase Ib clinical study assessed the pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety profiles of once-daily Tio+Olo FDC (5 μg/5 μg) after single dose and at steady state in Chinese patients with moderate to severe COPD over 3 weeks. The PK and safety profiles of Japanese and Caucasian populations from 2 independent COPD studies were provided for comparison. RESULTS A total of 12 Chinese patients received Tio+Olo FDC. After multiple inhaled administration of Tio+Olo FDC, tiotropium and olodaterol were rapidly absorbed and reached peak plasma concentration at about 5 and 25 min, respectively. The accumulation ratios after multiple administrations were 1.3 and 1.6 for tiotropium and olodaterol in Chinese patients. Tio+Olo FDC was well-tolerated; all AEs were mild. CONCLUSION Tio+Olo FDC (5 μg/5 μg) was rapidly absorbed and had a good safety profile in Chinese patients with COPD.","Wang, Zhenlei; Tadayasu, Yusuke; Hu, Na; Shu, Shiqing; Hu, Chao; Luo, Zhu",Pulmonary pharmacology & therapeutics,331,7

Here, we compare methyl rotations in the dry and variously hydrated states of three primary drugs under consideration to treat the recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19), namely, hydroxychloroquine and its sulfate, dexamethasone and its sodium diphosphate, and remdesivir. We find that the main driving force behind the considerable reduction in the activation energy for methyl rotations in the hydrated state is the hydration-induced disorder in the methyl group local environments. Furthermore, the activation energy for methyl rotations in the hydration-induced disordered state is much lower than that in an isolated drug molecule, indicating that neither isolated molecules nor periodic crystalline structures can be used to analyze the potential landscape governing the side group dynamics in drug molecules. Instead, only the explicitly considered disordered structures can provide insight.","Mamontov, Eugene; Cheng, Yongqiang; Daemen, Luke L; Kolesnikov, Alexander I; Ramirez-Cuesta, Anibal J; Ryder, Matthew R; Stone, Matthew B",The journal of physical chemistry letters,331,5

METHODS A literature search was undertaken for RCTs comparing SILC with MLC in adult patients with benign gallbladder disease. Primary outcomes were body image and cosmesis scores at different time points. Secondary outcomes included intraoperative and postoperative complications, postoperative pain and frequency of port-site hernia. RESULTS Thirty-seven RCTs were included, with a total of 3051 patients. The body image score favoured SILC at all time points (short term: mean difference (MD) -2·09, P < 0·001; mid term: MD -1·33, P < 0·001), as did the cosmesis score (short term: MD 3·20, P < 0·001; mid term: MD 4·03, P < 0·001; long-term: MD 4·87, P = 0·05) and the wound satisfaction score (short term: MD 1·19, P = 0·03; mid term: MD 1·38, P < 0·001; long-term: MD 1·19, P = 0·02). Duration of operation was longer for SILC (MD 13·56 min; P < 0·001) and SILC required more additional ports (odds ratio (OR) 6·78; P < 0·001). Postoperative pain assessed by a visual analogue scale (VAS) was lower for SILC at 12 h after operation (MD in VAS score -0·80; P = 0·007). The incisional hernia rate was higher after SILC (OR 2·50, P = 0·03). All other outcomes were similar for both groups. CONCLUSION SILC is associated with better outcomes in terms of cosmesis, body image and postoperative pain. The risk of incisional hernia is four times higher after SILC than after MLC.","Haueter, R; Schütz, T; Raptis, D A; Clavien, P-A; Zuber, M",The British journal of surgery,331,1

We examined the relationship between the bispectral index (BIS) and responses to the isolated forearm technique (IFT) to evaluate the adequacy of general anaesthesia in C/S and determine a suitable cut-off point for BIS values based on IFT results. METHODS In 61 parturients, a standardized anaesthetic technique was applied. It included sodium thiopental and succinylcholine for induction, and O2, N2O, and sevoflurane for maintenance of anaesthesia. BIS values and IFT response were recorded at 16 predetermined events during anaesthesia. RESULTS Positive IFT responses were seen in 41%, 46%, and 23% of the parturients at laryngoscopy, intubation, and skin incision, respectively. BIS could not reliably differentiate between IFT responders and non-responders during these three stages. The receiver operating characteristic curve cut-off points for BIS to predict IFT responders with 100% sensitivity were 34, 37, and 27, respectively, for these stages. In all stages of the operation after skin incision, more than 90% of parturients had no IFT test response, and BIS values between 40 and 63 were associated with negative IFT results. During a structured interview within 12-24 h after the operation, no patient had evidence of explicit recall of intraoperative events. CONCLUSIONS The BIS is not reliable for monitoring anaesthesia depth in C/S. Lower than previously recommended values are needed to avoid IFT test responses during laryngoscopy, intubation, and skin incision.","Zand, F; Hadavi, S M R; Chohedri, A; Sabetian, P",British journal of anaesthesia,331,12

The advantages of sIPN include spray-on application, in situ photopolymerization, and ability to cover large contoured areas. sIPN has also been shown to be an effective delivery vehicle for keratinocyte growth factor, dexamethasone, bupivacaine, and silver sulfadiazine in vitro. Our aim for this study was to show that these products delivered to the wound bed with sIPN would not change the wound healing characteristics compared with the control site through qualitative clinical evaluation and to compare the rate and quality of donor site healing through histologic evaluation. Eight Yucatan swine of 40 lbs each were randomly divided into four groups of two pigs before surgery. Each animal had 5.6% TBSA of skin harvested from two different dorsal regions, with one at 22/1000th-inch and the other at 30/1000th-inch setting on the dermatome. Each test site on each animal was then sequentially dressed with 50 cm(2) of Xeroform gauze, sIPN, sIPN loaded with 0.5% bupivacaine, or sIPN loaded with 1% silver sulfadiazine. sIPN with or without soluble drugs were applied as liquid, then photopolymerized in situ to form an elastic covering. Each of the test areas was separated by 50 cm(2) of autograft, which was used to divide the test areas. Wound assessment and killing occurred at days 7, 9, 14, and 21. A full-thickness biopsy was taken from each of the study areas for histological analysis. By 14 days, all areas showed complete epidermal coverage histologically. The 30/1000th-inch site revealed a thicker, more irregular dermis compared with the 22/1000th-site. Evaluation of the day-21 sites revealed equal thinning and flattening of the new epidermis. No site showed full restoration of the rete ridges. No signs of infection were seen in clinical or histological evaluations of any treatment. The addition of bupivacaine and silver sulfadiazine to sIPN does not show any alterations in wound healing of a donor site in a swine model when compared with sIPN without loaded drugs and a standard control dressing. This efficacy may be coupled with established localized sIPN drug delivery profiles and allow further studies to evaluate the efficacy of these drugs to promote healing, eradicate and prevent infection, and manage pain.","Faucher, Lee D; Kleinbeck, Kyle R; Kao, Weiyuan John",Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association,331,1

Update as of July 31st, 2020.",18.196661,7.0047455,2020-09-01,"The order in which genes are organized within a genome is generally not conserved between distantly related species. However, within virus orders and families, strong conservation of gene order is observed. The factors that constrain or promote gene-order diversity are largely unknown, although the regulation of gene expression is one important constraint for viruses. Here we investigate why gene order is conserved for a positive-strand RNA virus encoding a single polyprotein in the context of its authentic multicellular host. Initially, we identified the most plausible trajectory by which alternative gene orders could evolve. Subsequently, we studied the accessibility of key steps along this evolutionary trajectory by constructing two virus intermediates: (1) duplication of a gene followed by (2) loss of the ancestral gene. We identified five barriers to the evolution of alternative gene orders. First, the number of viable positions for reordering is limited. Second, the within-host fitness of viruses with gene duplications is low compared to the wild-type virus. Third, after duplication, the ancestral gene copy is always maintained and never the duplicated one. Fourth, viruses with an alternative gene order have even lower fitness than viruses with gene duplications. Fifth, after more than half a year of evolution in isolation, viruses with an alternative gene order are still vastly inferior to the wild-type virus. Our results show that all steps along plausible evolutionary trajectories to alternative gene orders are highly unlikely. Hence, the inaccessibility of these trajectories probably contributes to the conservation of gene order in present-day viruses.","Willemsen, Anouk; Zwart, Mark P; Tromas, Nicolas; Majer, Eszter; Daròs, José-Antonio; Elena, Santiago F",Genetics,331,26

Here we report the synthesis of seven new C 2h symmetric tetrapodal SCRs. The structures of these SCRs possess a conserved biaryl core, and they vary in the four heterocyclic binding groups that are linked to the biaryl core via secondary amines. Supramolecular association between these SCRs and 5 biologically relevant C 1 -O-octyloxy glycans, α/β-glucoside ( α/β-Glc ), α/β-mannoside ( α/β-Man ), and β-galactoside ( β-Gal ), was studied by mass spectrometry, 1 H NMR titrations, and molecular modeling. These studies revealed that selectivity can be achieved in these tetrapodal SCRs by varying the heterocyclic binding group. We found that SCR017 (3-pyrrole), SCR021 (3-pyridine), and SCR022 (2-phenol) bind only to β-Glc . SCR019 (3-indole) binds only to β-Man. SCR020 (2-pyridine) binds β-Man and α-Man with a preference to the latter. SCR018 (2-indole) binds α-Man and β-Gal with a preference to the former. The glycan guests bound within their SCR hosts in one of three supramolecular geometries: center-parallel, center perpendicular, and off-center. Many host•guest combinations formed higher stoichiometry complexes, 2:1 glycan•SCR or 1:2 glycan•SCR , where the former are driven by positive allosteric cooperativity induced by glycan-glycan contacts.","Bravo, Marcelo Fernando; Palanichamy, Kalanidhi; Shlain, Milan; Schiro, Frank; Naeem, Yasir; Marianski, Mateusz; Braunschweig, Adam B",Chemistry,331,28

We aimed to evaluate initiation timing and clinical outcomes of dabigatran in AIS patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). DESIGN Retrospective study based on prospectively collected data in SITS (Safe Implementation of Treatment in Stroke) Thrombolysis and Thrombectomy Registry from July 2014 to July 2018. PARTICIPANTS European NVAF patients (≥18 years) hospitalised after first-ever ischaemic stroke. SETTING A multinational, observational monitoring register. INTERVENTION Dabigatran initiation within 3 months after the ischaemic stroke. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES The primary outcome was time from first-ever ischaemic stroke (index event) to dabigatran initiation. Additional outcomes included physicians' reasons for delaying dabigatran initiation beyond acute hospital discharge and outcomes within 3 months of index event. METHODS We identified patients with NVAF who received dabigatran within 3 months of the index event. We performed descriptive statistics for baseline and demographic data and clinical outcomes after dabigatran initiation. RESULTS In total, 1489 patients with NVAF received dabigatran after AIS treated with thrombolysis and/or thrombectomy. Of these, 1240 had available initiation time. At baseline, median age was 75 years; 53% of patients were women, 15% were receiving an oral anticoagulant, 29% acetylsalicylic acid and 4% clopidogrel. Most patients (82%) initiated dabigatran within 14 days after the index event. Patients initiating earlier had lower stroke severity from median NIHSS 8 (IQR 6-13) if initiated within 7 days to NIHSS 15 (9-19) if initiated between 28 days and 3 months. Most common reasons for delaying initiation were haemorrhagic transformation or intracranial haemorrhage, stroke severity and infarct size. Few thrombotic/haemorrhagic events occurred within 3 months after the index event (20 of 926 patients, 2.2% with the available data). CONCLUSIONS Our findings, together with previous observational studies, indicate that dabigatran initiated within the first days after an AIS is safe in patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis, endovascular thrombectomy or both.

There is little data describing the safety and efficacy of endovascular thrombolysis and the frequency of post-thrombotic syndrome after thrombolysis in children. OBJECTIVE Retrospective analysis of children undergoing percutaneous endovascular thrombolysis to determine (1) the safety and efficacy of this procedure and (2) the frequency of the diagnosis of post-thrombotic syndrome after thrombolysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS We reviewed the medical and imaging databases for children who underwent percutaneous endovascular thrombolysis for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) between November 2008 and June 2013 at our institution. Demographic data were reviewed for the technical success and complications of thrombolysis and the last assigned post-thrombotic syndrome score using standardized scoring tools. RESULTS Forty-one children ages 3 months to 21 years (median age: 15 years; 44% male) underwent percutaneous endovascular thrombolysis between November 2008 and June 2013. Upper extremity DVT occurred in 13 patients (32%); lower extremity DVT occurred in 28 patients (68%). All 41 patients received thrombolysis grading; 90% of those patients achieved greater than 50% thrombus lysis. Twenty-eight patients received formal post-thrombotic syndrome scoring and 4 (14%) met diagnostic criteria for post-thrombotic syndrome. One major bleeding episode and one pulmonary embolism occurred with no long-term sequelae. CONCLUSION Endovascular thrombolysis for DVT in children is safe, effective at thrombus removal and may reduce the incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome.

The utility of this body of work is unclear. The objective of this study was to synthesize all such systematic reviews in terms of clinical effectiveness, to appraise their quality, and to determine whether areas of duplication exist across reviews. METHODS Systematic reviews comparing laparoscopic and open surgery for colorectal cancer were identified using a comprehensive search protocol (1991 to 2008). The primary outcome was overall survival. The methodological quality of reviews was appraised using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) instrument. Abstraction and quality appraisal was carried out by two independent reviewers. Reviews were synthesized, and outcomes were compared qualitatively. A citation analysis was carried out using simple matrices to assess the comprehensiveness of each review. RESULTS In total, 27 reviews were included; 13 reviews included only randomized controlled trials. Rectal cancer was addressed exclusively by four reviews. There was significant overlap between review purposes, populations and, outcomes. The mean AMSTAR score (out of 11) was 5.8 (95% CI: 4.6 to 7.0). Overall survival was evaluated by ten reviews, none of which found a significant difference. Three reviews provided a selective meta-analysis of time-to-event data. Previously published systematic reviews were poorly and highly selectively referenced (mean citation ratio 0.16, 95% CI: 0.093 to 0.22). Previously published trials were not comprehensively identified and cited (mean citation ratio 0.56, 95% CI: 0.46 to 0.65). CONCLUSIONS Numerous overlapping systematic reviews of laparoscopic and open surgery for colorectal cancer exist in the literature. Despite variable methods and quality, survival outcomes are congruent across reviews. A duplication of research efforts appears to exist in the literature.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within cytokine genes with T1D in a cohort of Saudi subjects. METHODS A total of 300 well-characterized type 1 diabetic patients and 300 T1D-free control subjects were enrolled in this investigation. Cytokine SNPs were genotyped by using Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with sequence-specific primers. RESULTS Our data revealed that IFN-γ +874T allele carriers [odds ratio (OR) = 1.87, p < 0.001] and TT homozygotes (OR = 1.28, p < 0.001) were significantly more susceptible to developing T1D than the A allele carriers. In addition, TNF-α -308A allele carriers (OR = 1.73, p < 0.001) and AA homozygotes (OR = 1.74, p < 0.001) were also overrepresented among the diabetics than G allele carriers. IL-4 -590C/T TT homozygotes (OR = 2.23, p < 0.001) were significantly more susceptible to develop T1D than CC genotypes, whereas CT heterozygotes were not significantly associated (OR = 1.43, p = 0.78) with T1D. Furthermore, IL-4 T allele was statistically associated with T1D patients compared to control group (OR = 2.24, p < 0.001). Similarly, IL-1β -511C/T TT homozygotes (OR = 1.85, p = 0.012) and the T allele (OR = 1.85, p < 0.001) were significantly more susceptible to T1D than CC genotypes, whereas TC heterozygotes (OR = 1.04, p = 0.86) were not significantly associated with T1D. CONCLUSION Our data concluded that IFN-γ +874T allele, TNF-α -308A allele, IL-1β -511T allele, and IL-4 -590T allele could be considered risk factors for T1D development in Saudi subjects.","Allam, Gamal; Nasr, Amre; Talaat, Iman M; Abuelsaad, Abdelaziz S A; Bakheit, Ali M; Nemenqani, Dalal; Alsulaimani, Adnan A",Immunological investigations,331,19

It is unknown whether different surgical approaches affect changes in CAR differently. The objective of this study was to compare the potential change in CAR in preterm infants during and after ligation comparing two surgical approaches: sternotomy and posterolateral thoracotomy. Design: This was an observational cohort pilot study. Setting: Level III NICU. Patients: Preterm infants (GA < 32 weeks) requiring ductal ligation were eligible for inclusion. Interventions: Halfway the study period, our standard surgical approach changed from a posterolateral thoracotomy to sternotomy. We analyzed dynamic CAR, using an index of autoregulation (COx) correlating cerebral tissue oxygen saturation and invasive arterial blood pressure measurements, before, during, and after ligation, in relation to the two approaches. Measurements and Main Results: Of nine infants, four were approached by thoracotomy and five by sternotomy. Median GA was 26 (range: 24.9-27.9) weeks, median birth weight (BW) was 800 (640-960) grams, and median post-natal age (PNA) was 18 (15-30) days, without differences between groups. COx worsened significantly more during and after thoracotomy from baseline (Δρ from baseline: during surgery: Δ + 0.32, at 4 h: Δ + 0.36, at 8 h: Δ + 0.32, at 12 h: Δ + 0.31) as compared with sternotomy patients (Δρ from baseline: during surgery: Δ + 0.20, at 4 h: Δ + 0.05, at 8 h: Δ + 0.15, at 12 h: Δ + 0.11) (F = 6.50; p = 0.038). Conclusions: In preterm infants, CAR reduced significantly during and up to 12 h after ductal ligation in all infants, but more evident during and after posterolateral thoracotomy as compared with sternotomy. These results need to be confirmed in a larger population.","Kooi, Elisabeth M W; van der Laan, Michelle E; Accord, Ryan E; Roofthooft, Marcus T R; Aries, Marcel J; Elting, Jan Willem J",Frontiers in pediatrics,331,1

This phenomenon has yet to be directly explored in episodic memory, nor explored for physiological correlates or reaction times. We designed a novel method to elicit the DKE via a test of item recognition while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Throughout the task, participants were asked to estimate the percentile in which they performed compared to others. Results revealed participants in the bottom 25th percentile overestimated their percentile, while participants in the top 75th percentile underestimated their percentile, exhibiting the classic DKE. Reaction time measures revealed a condition by group interaction whereby over-estimators responded faster than under-estimators when estimating being in the top percentile and responded slower when estimating being in the bottom percentile. Between-group EEG differences were evident between over-estimators and under-estimators during Dunning-Kruger responses, which revealed FN400-like effects of familiarity supporting differences for over-estimators, whereas 'old-new' memory event-related potential (ERP) effects revealed a late parietal component (LPC) associated with recollection-based processing for under-estimators that was not evident for over-estimators. Findings suggest over- and under-estimators use differing cognitive processes when assessing their performance, such that under-estimators may rely on recollection during memory while over-estimators may draw upon excess familiarity when over-estimating their performance. Episodic memory thus appears to play a contributory role in metacognitive judgments of illusory superiority.","Muller, Alana; Sirianni, Lindsey A; Addante, Richard J",The European journal of neuroscience,331,1

Recent animal studies were unable to reflect this clinical pathophysiological process, largely hampering the development of new efficacious therapies. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM-2) is a novel immune regulator with multiple activities. However, very little is known about the regulatory role of TREM-2 in sepsis upon aging. METHODS Blood samples were collected from septic patients within 24 hours after Intensive Care Unit admission. The patients were preselected into two groups based on the age (age with ≥ 60 years old and age with < 60 years old). Sepsis in aged mice was induced by cecal ligation and puncture. The expression of TREM-2 was evaluated in septic patients and aged septic mice. Aged macrophages overexpressing TREM-2 and green fluorescent protein (GFP) were administered to aged septic mice after cecal ligation and puncture. Survival rate was monitored, and bacterial load and inflammatory mediators levels were evaluated. In vivo IL-23 function was blocked using appropriate monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS The expression levels of TREM-2 were downregulated in both aged septic patients and aged septic mice. The administration of TREM-2-overexpressing macrophages significantly prolonged survival and alleviated organ injury in the aged septic mice. The protective effect did not affect host bacterial burden, but markedly inhibited the host IL-17A response, as determined by a multiplex cytokine assay. Screening the expression of IL-17A-related activating factors revealed that the IL-23 level in TREM-2-overexpressing macrophages was significantly lower than that in GFP-expressing macrophages. Blocking IL-23 after the administration of GFP-expressing macrophages protected aged mice against sepsis. CONCLUSIONS TREM-2 prolonged survival of aged mice from sepsis by finely modulating the IL-23/IL-17A immune pathway. These results provide previously unidentified mechanistic insight into immune regulation by TREM-2 and new therapeutic targets in sepsis upon aging.","Chen, QiXing; Yang, Yang; Wu, XiaoLiang; Yang, ShiYue; Zhang, Yan; Shu, Qiang; Fang, XiangMing",Shock,331,1

PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes from 2009 to 2012 were recruited for this population-based and observational study. Diabetes complications severity index (DCSI) score and defined daily dose (DDD) were used for analysis. The multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the risk of KP pneumonia by DPP4i use, with adjustments for propensity score. The Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test was used to estimate the risk of KP pneumonia for DPP4i users. RESULTS 34774 patients were included. The incidence rate of KP pneumonia in DDP4i users was 1.51 per 1000 person-years and that for the comparison was 2.25 per 1000 person-years. DDP4i users also had a significantly lower cumulative incidence of KP pneumonia (log-rank test p-value = 0.03). DDP4i users had a significantly lower risk of developing KP pneumonia compared with nonusers (adjusted HR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.48-0.95). CONCLUSIONS For public health issue with type2 diabetes and infection, DPP4i use decreased KP pneumonia. Male gender, patients with co-morbidities, patients with higher DSCI score and higher DDD of DPP4i were observed to decrease KP pneumonia infection in our analysis. The possible role of DPP4i causing immunological disturbances should be considered.","Chen, Hsin-Hung; Chen, Ching-Chu; Ho, Chun-Wei; Hsieh, Ming-Chia; Hsu, Sheng-Pang; Lin, Cheng-Li; Kao, Chia-Hung",Postgraduate medicine,331,1

This article summarizes the efforts, successes, and challenges experienced by ISU-CVM clinical faculty during this transition. Numerous data sources were reviewed, including college records and announcements, faculty survey results, and student rotation evaluations. Data were explored using quantitative and qualitative methods. Between March and July 2020, 36 faculty from 15 different clinical services invested approximately 5,000 hours in delivering virtual content to 165 VM4 students from ISU-CVM and Caribbean veterinary schools. With departmental, college, and university assistance, faculty effectively used educational technologies (Zoom, Canvas, Echo360) and developed adaptive and innovative methods for virtual content delivery. Virtual VM4 rotations were collectively well received and appreciated by students, and student evaluation scores were statistically equivalent or higher for virtual rotations than for the corresponding in-person rotations in the preceding year. Although certain hands-on skills could not be adequately acquired in a virtual environment, students gained theoretical knowledge and case-based problem-solving skills in the online format. Faculty reported satisfaction with their adaptability and resilience in these challenging circumstances. These findings demonstrate that ISU-CVM clinical faculty invested substantial time and effort to transition in-person clinical rotations to virtual format during the early COVID-19 pandemic. This is particularly noteworthy given that many of these same faculty simultaneously served as essential personnel managing clinical cases in the university's teaching hospital.","Ward, Jessica L; Mulherin, Brenda L; Vengrin, Courtney A",Journal of veterinary medical education,331,28

Understanding the SARS-CoV-2 mechanism of infection is crucial in the development of potential therapeutics and vaccines. The infection process is triggered by direct binding of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) to the host cell receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Many efforts have been made to design or repurpose therapeutics to deactivate RBD or ACE2 and prevent the initial binding. In addition to direct inhibition strategies, small chemical compounds might be able to interfere and destabilize the meta-stable, pre-fusion complex of ACE2-RBD. This approach can be employed to prevent the further progress of virus infection at its early stages. In this study, Molecular docking is employed to analyze the binding of two chemical compounds, SSAA09E2 and Nilotinib, with the druggable pocket of the ACE2-RBD complex. The structural changes as a result of the interference with the ACE2-RBD complex are analyzed by molecular dynamics simulations. Results show that both Nilotinib and SSAA09E2 can induce significant conformational changes in the ACE2-RBD complex, intervene with the hydrogen bonds, and influence the flexibility of proteins. Moreover, essential dynamics analysis suggests that the presence of small molecules can trigger large-scale conformational changes that may destabilize the ACE2-RBD complex.","Razizadeh, Meghdad; Nikfar, Mehdi; Liu, Yaling",ChemRxiv : the preprint server for chemistry,331,29

Reduction of such pain by local anesthetics that are delivered for several days postoperatively is a desirable clinical objective, which is approached by a new formulation and applied in animal studies reported here. METHODS We subcutaneously injected a new formulation of poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid polymer microspheres, which provides steady drug release for 96+ hours into rats at the dorsal region 2 hours before surgery. A single 1.2-cm-long skin incision was followed by blunt dissection of skin away from the underlying fascia, and closed by 2 sutures, followed by 14 days of testing. Microspheres containing 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg bupivacaine were injected locally 2 hours before surgery; bupivacaine-free microspheres were the vehicle control, and bupivacaine HCl solution (0.5%), the positive control. Mechanical sensitivity was determined by the frequency of local muscle contractions to repeated pokes with nylon monofilaments (von Frey hairs) exerting 4 and 15 g forces, testing, respectively, allodynia and hyperalgesia, and by pinprick. RESULTS Injection of bupivacaine microspheres (40 mg drug) into intact skin reduced responses to 15 g von Frey hairs for 6 hours and to pinprick for 36 hours. Respective reductions from bupivacaine HCl lasted for 3 and 2 hours. Skin incision and dissection alone caused mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia for 14 days. Microspheres containing 20 or 40 mg bupivacaine suppressed postoperative hypersensitivity for up to 3 days, reduced integrated allodynia (area under curve of response versus time) over postoperative days 1 to 5 by 51% ± 20% (mean ± SE) and 78% ± 12%, and reduced integrated hyperalgesia by 55% ± 13% and 64% ± 11%, for the respective doses. Five and ten milligrams bupivacaine in microspheres and the 0.5% bupivacaine solution were ineffective in reducing postoperative hypersensitivity, as were 40 mg bupivacaine microspheres injected contralateral to the incision. CONCLUSIONS Significant suppression of postoperative pain by the slow-release bupivacaine preparation outlasts its anesthetic action on intact skin. These findings demonstrate preventive analgesia and indicate the importance of acute processes in the development of chronic postoperative pain.","Ohri, Rachit; Wang, Jeffrey Chi-Fei; Blaskovich, Phillip D; Pham, Lan N; Costa, Daniel S; Nichols, Gary A; Hildebrand, William P; Scarborough, Nelson L; Herman, Clifford J; Strichartz, Gary R",Anesthesia and analgesia,331,8

In diatoms and green algae, plasma-membranes are moderately to highly permeable to CO2 but effectively impermeable to HCO3 - . Here, CO2 and HCO3 - membrane permeabilities were measured using an 18 O-exchange technique on two species of haptophyte algae, Emiliania huxleyi and Calcidiscus leptoporus, which showed that the plasma membranes of these species are also highly permeable to CO2 (0.006 to 0.02 cm · s-1 ) but minimally permeable to HCO3 - . Increased temperature and CO2 generally increased CO2 membrane permeabilities in both species, possibly due to changes in lipid composition or CO2 channel proteins. Changes in CO2 membrane permeabilities showed no association with the density of calcium carbonate coccoliths surrounding the cell, which could potentially impede passage of compounds. Haptophyte plasma membrane permeabilities to CO2 were somewhat lower than those of diatoms but generally higher than membrane permeabilities of green algae. One caveat of these measurements is that the model used to interpret 18 O-exchange data assumes that carbonic anhydrase, which catalyzes 18 O-exchange, is homogeneously distributed in the cell. The implications of this assumption were tested by using a two-compartment model with an inhomogeneous distribution of carbonic anhydrase to simulate 18 O-exchange data and then inferring plasma-membrane CO2 permeabilities from the simulated data. This analysis showed that the inferred plasma-membrane CO2 permeabilities are minimal estimates but should be quite accurate under most conditions.","Blanco-Ameijeiras, Sonia; Stoll, Heather M; Zhang, Hongrui; Hopkinson, Brian M",Journal of phycology,331,0

We hypothesized that using a scoring balloon for the side branch and a drug-eluting stent for the main vessel might improve outcomes of true bifurcation lesions. METHODS AND RESULTS A total of 93 patients with complex bifurcations were enrolled in a multicenter, single-arm, prospective clinical trial. A drug-eluting stent was deployed in the main vessel following dilatation of the side-branch stenosis with a scoring balloon. The overall angiographic success rate was 93.5%, and procedural success rate was 91.4%. The final diameter stenosis was 13.9% ± 7.2% for the main vessel and 33.3% ± 22.9% for the side branch. Crossover to stent deployment in the side branch was required in 10.8%. The postscoring balloon dissection rate was 8.2% and 6% (all ≤ class C) for the main vessel and side branch respectively, which was reduced to 1.1 and 2.1% poststenting. At 9-month follow-up, the composite MACE rate [cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or target lesion revascularization (TLR)] was 5.4%, including a TLR rate of 3.3% (1.1% from hospital discharge to 9 months). CONCLUSION The 9-month results of the AGILITY trial support a simple provisional strategy for treating complex true bifurcation lesions with deployment of a drug-eluting stent in the main vessel after dilatation of the side-branch vessel with a scoring balloon. This strategy was associated with excellent and safe procedural results, a low rate of crossover to side-branch stenting, and favorable outcomes.","Weisz, Giora; Metzger, D Christopher; Liberman, Henry A; O'Shaughnessy, Charles D; Douglas, John S; Turco, Mark A; Mehran, Roxana; Gershony, Gary; Leon, Martin B; Moses, Jeffrey W",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,331,1

Most studies addressing virulence factors of B. bronchiseptica utilize isolates derived from hosts other than pigs in conjunction with rodent infection models. Based on previous in vivo mouse studies, we hypothesized that the B. bronchiseptica type III secretion system (T3SS) would be required for maximal disease severity and persistence in the swine lower respiratory tract. To examine the contribution of the T3SS to the pathogenesis of B. bronchiseptica in swine, we compared the abilities of a virulent swine isolate and an isogenic T3SS mutant to colonize, cause disease, and be transmitted from host to host. We found that the T3SS is required for maximal persistence throughout the lower swine respiratory tract and contributed significantly to the development of nasal lesions and pneumonia. However, the T3SS mutant and the wild-type parent are equally capable of transmission among swine by both direct and indirect routes, demonstrating that transmission can occur even with attenuated disease. Our data further suggest that the T3SS skews the adaptive immune response in swine by hindering the development of serum anti-Bordetella antibody levels and inducing an interleukin-10 (IL-10) cell-mediated response, likely contributing to the persistence of B. bronchiseptica in the respiratory tract. Overall, our results demonstrate that the Bordetella T3SS is required for maximal persistence and disease severity in pigs, but not for transmission.","Nicholson, Tracy L; Brockmeier, Susan L; Loving, Crystal L; Register, Karen B; Kehrli, Marcus E; Shore, Sarah M",Infection and immunity,331,1

Neighborhood-level redlining and lending bias represent state-sponsored systems of segregation, potential drivers of adverse health outcomes. We sought to estimate the effect of redlining and lending bias on breast cancer (BC) mortality and explore differences by race. METHODS Using Georgia Cancer Registry data, we included 4943 non-Hispanic White (NHW) and 3580 non-Hispanic Black (NHB) women with a first primary invasive BC diagnosis in metro-Atlanta (2010-2014). Redlining and lending bias were derived for census tracts using the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act database. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations of redlining, lending bias on BC mortality and estimated race-stratified associations. RESULTS Overall, 20% of NHW and 80% of NHB women lived in redlined census tracts, and 60% of NHW and 26% of NHB women lived in census tracts with pronounced lending bias. Living in redlined census tracts was associated with a nearly 60% increase in BC mortality (HR=1.58, 95%CI=1.37-1.82) while residing in areas with substantial lending bias reduced the hazard of BC mortality (HR=0.86, 95%CI=0.75-0.99). Among NHB women living in redlined census tracts we observed a slight increase in BC mortality (HR=1.13, 95%CI=0.90-1.42); among NHW women the association was more pronounced (HR=1.39, 95%CI=1.09-1.78).

MgSt-V macroscopic analysis included mean particle size, specific surface area, particle morphology, and BFE. Principal component analysis and partial least squares multivariate analysis techniques were used to develop predictive qualitative and quantitative relationships between the molecular and macroscopic properties of MgSt-V grades, design variables, and resulting tablet formulation properties. MgSt-V fraction and blending time and their square effects showed statistical significant effects. Significant variation in the molecular and macroscopic properties of MgSt-V did not have a statistically significant impact on the studied product quality attributes (BFE, TMS, DT, and LSR). In setting excipient release specifications, functional testing may be appropriate in certain cases to assess the effect of statistically significant different molecular and macroscopic properties on product quality attributes.","Haware, Rahul V; Dave, Vivek S; Kakarala, Bhavyasri; Delaney, Sean; Staton, Scott; Munson, Eric; Gupta, Mali Ram; Stagner, William C",European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,331,19

However, the differences regarding the training loads and implementation between synchronous and asynchronous types are not yet known. The purpose of this study was to compare the implementation and training load between synchronous and asynchronous tele-exercise programs in individuals with spinal cord injury. METHODS Forty individuals with spinal cord injury were recruited and stratified into tetraplegia and paraplegia groups. All subjects performed 3 weeks of both the synchronous and asynchronous tele-exercise programs, after two weeks of familiarization with the exercises, remote connection tools and methods to record information. The primary outcomes were training load (average daily workload and average and total weekly training load) and implementation (adherence and successful exercise recording). Demographic characteristics were obtained from participants' electronic medical records. RESULTS Weekly mean workload, total workload, adherence and successful exercise recording presented significantly higher values in the synchronous compared to asynchronous tele-exercises. Average daily workload did not present significant differences between the tele-exercises. DISCUSSION The training load for each training session presented no differences between synchronous and asynchronous tele-exercises. Both adherence and successful data recording showed more favourable implementation values for synchronous training, thus allowing greater weekly training loads (total and average).","Costa, Rodrigo Rodrigues Gomes; Dorneles, Jefferson R; Veloso, João Hcl; Gonçalves, Carlos Wp; Neto, Frederico Ribeiro",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,331,2

However, regional anesthesia is slowly finding viable applications in this field. This review aims at providing an update on the current practice of regional anesthesia techniques outside of the operating theatre. RECENT FINDINGS Some anesthetic departments have implemented the use of regional anesthesia in novel applications outside of the operating room. In most cases, it remains an adjunct to general anesthesia but is sometimes used as the sole anesthetic technique. The use of the paravertebral block during radiofrequency ablation of different tumors is a recent application in interventional radiology. In emergency medicine, regional anesthesia is gaining traction in analgesia for trauma patients. SUMMARY Regional anesthesia is finding its way into broader applications every day, offering a range of potential benefits in anesthetic care. Its implementation in NORA is promising and may aid in decreasing patient morbidity. However, great care should be taken in applying the recommended safety precautions for regional anesthesia in any setting.","Faddoul, Annibal; Bonnet, Francis",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,331,1

However, they have varying effectiveness in the management of perianal CD. Identifying the most appropriate therapy and optimizing it is essential to maximize effectiveness of therapy. Additionally, the management of perianal CD requires imaging of the perianal area to identify the fistula anatomy and local complications such as abscesses that require surgical drainage. Initial surgical assessment is key to drain abscesses and allow fistula healing with medical therapy. RECENT FINDINGS Although anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNFs) remain the most effective medications to treat perianal CD, real-world data suggests that ustekinumab may be a 2nd-line option in patients nonresponsive to an anti-TNF or having contraindications. Mesenchymal stem cells are an emerging therapeutic approach that is currently in Phase 3 trials in the United States and poised to play a major role in the treatment algorithm.

Most eukaryotic viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm, including coronaviruses, have evolved strategies to cap their RNAs. In this report, we used a yeast genetic system to functionally screen for the cap-forming enzymes encoded by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and identified the nonstructural protein (nsp) 14 of SARS coronavirus as a (guanine-N7)-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) in vivo in yeast cells and in vitro using purified enzymes and RNA substrates. Interestingly, coronavirus nsp14 was previously characterized as a 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease, and by mutational analysis, we mapped the N7-MTase domain to the carboxy-terminal part of nsp14 that shows features conserved with cellular N7-MTase in structure-based sequence alignment. The exoribonuclease active site was dispensable but the exoribonuclease domain was required for N7-MTase activity. Such combination of the 2 functional domains in coronavirus nsp14 suggests that it may represent a novel form of RNA-processing enzymes. Mutational analysis in a replicon system showed that the N7-MTase activity was important for SARS virus replication/transcription and can thus be used as an attractive drug target to develop antivirals for control of coronaviruses including the deadly SARS virus. Furthermore, the observation that the N7-MTase of RNA life could function in lieu of that in DNA life provides interesting evolutionary insight and practical possibilities in antiviral drug screening.","Chen, Yu; Cai, Hui; Pan, Ji'an; Xiang, Nian; Tien, Po; Ahola, Tero; Guo, Deyin",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,331,7

However, few studies have investigated telemedicine from the perspective of the patient experience. OBJECTIVE To evaluate patient satisfaction scores of telemedicine outpatient clinic visits in neurosurgery in comparison with in-person visits. METHODS After obtaining Institutional Review Board approval, Press Ganey surveys from 3/1/2019 to 9/15/2020 were evaluated retrospectively from single-institution, academic neurosurgical clinics. Due to the non-normality of our data, stratified Wilcoxon tests were performed with correction for care provider differences. Domain score probability values were corrected for multiple comparisons. Average scores (range 20-100) are documented as mean ± standard deviation. RESULTS The response rates were 20% (97 responders) for telemedicine visits and 19% (589 responders) for in-person visits. Patient overall satisfaction score was slightly higher with telemedicine visits compared to in-person corrected for care provider differences (94.2 ± 12.2 vs 93.1 ± 13.4, p = 0.085). The care provider domain demonstrated no statistically significant difference in telemedicine compared to in-person (94.7 ± 14.4 vs 92.4 ± 16.5, p = 0.096). The access domain (93.7 ± 12.3 vs 93.4 ± 12.4, p = 0.999) and overall domains (94.1 ± 12.1 vs 94.4 ± 13.4, p = 1.000) were not found to be different between visit types. CONCLUSION Telemedicine appears to be a valuable option for neurosurgical patients and is not significantly different to in-person visits in all domains. This study demonstrates that telemedicine visits result in comparable satisfaction scores by neurosurgical patients, and providers should continue offering this option to their patients as we approach the post-COVID era.","Porche, Ken; Vaziri, Sasha; Mehkri, Yusuf; Christie, Carlton; Laurent, Dimitri; Wang, Yu; Rahman, Maryam",Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,331,31

The initial step for all drug discovery models is the identification of suitable targets. One approach organizations may take to tackle this involves issuing raw data publicly for collaboration with other organizations in order to spark discussion, collectively experiment and stay up to date with advances in scientific knowledge. Areas covered: Numerous organizations have released genomic data, amongst other tools, for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and this has led to the development of growing datasets of knowledge for continued collaboration amongst different scientific communities. A different technique employs a more closed, market-driven method in order to stay ahead financially in the race for developing a suitable antiviral or vaccine. The latter allows sustained motivation for company ambitions and progress has been made toward clinical trials for potential drugs. Expert opinion: A case can be made for both open and closed drug discovery models; however, due to the rapidly evolving nature of this deadly virus, organizations should collate their research and support one another to ensure satisfactory treatment can be approved in a timely manner.","Harky, Amer; Mishra, Vaibhav; Ansari, Daniyal Matin; Melamed, Naomi",Expert opinion on drug discovery,331,31

It causes life events which trigger anxiety, depression, anger, sleep deprivation, emotional distress and stress. World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic on March 11, pointing to the over 118,000 cases in over 110 countries. Many healthcare workers became ill during the pandemic and some among them died. In this study we aimed to evaluate and compare level of stress against COVID-19 pandemic among doctors from Turkey and Italy. METHODS This research is a cross-sectional study in which Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) and Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale (STSS) are administered online via social networks. All data collection tools were delivered to individuals between 1-15 June 2020 and filled in online with Google Forms application. In total 618 individuals were included in this study and all of them were medical doctors. RESULTS Higher PS and STS levels were found related to woman gender, being married, working in pandemic hospital and older ages. Stress levels were found statistically higher in Turkish doctors comparing to Italian doctors for both stress scales (Turkish/Italian PSS:20.18±7.90/ 19.35±6.71, STSS: 44.19±13.29/ 38.83±13.74). CONCLUSION The number of doctors per 1,000 of population is lower and per capita visits to a physician is higher in Turkey comparing to Italy. Besides pandemic, these heavier working conditions, increased weekly working hours can cause stress for Turkish doctors. Reporting information such this study and international collaborations are essential to plan future prevention strategies. We need to strengthen international ties and build more international collaborations rather than staying within our national silos. Additionally, interventions to promote mental well-being in health care professionals exposed to COVID-19 need to be immediately implemented.","Ozen, Gulsum; Zanfardino, Angela; Ozen, Gulsah; Acan, Burak; Piscopo, Alessia; Casaburo, Francesca; Gicchino, Francesca; Confetto, Santino; Troncone, Alda; Iafusco, Dario",International journal of clinical practice,331,31

It could reduce Zika virus-related costs by $65.2 million ($2.8 million from less Zika virus testing and monitoring and $62.3 million from avoided costs of Zika virus-associated microcephaly [ZAM]). The estimates are influenced by the contraception methods used, the frequency of ZAM, and the lifetime incremental cost of ZAM. Accounting for unwanted pregnancies that are prevented, irrespective of Zika virus infection, an additional $40.4 million in medical costs would be avoided through the intervention.

The aim of this study was to describe RSV subtype circulation patterns and associated disease severity to inform on potential impact of an RSV-specific prevention strategy. METHODS Single-centre retrospective observational study of children aged <16 years with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection from 2014 to 2018 inclusive. We described the features and frequency of all RSV subtype detections. We selected a random sample of RSV-A and RSV-B cases from each year (n = 200), described demographic and clinical features of these cases, and compared indicators of disease severity between subtypes. RESULTS We identified 3591 RSV detections over a 5-year period and found consistent co-circulation of subtypes with alternating predominance. Demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between children presenting with RSV-A and RSV-B infections. There was no difference in indicators of severity between the subtypes except for paediatric intensive care unit length of stay which was longer in the RSV-B group (3 vs. 5 days, P = 0.006). Respiratory co-infections were more frequent in the RSV-B group (41.8% vs. 27.4%, P = 0.035). When these were excluded there was no longer a detectable difference in paediatric intensive care unit length of stay. CONCLUSIONS We found co-circulation of RSV subtypes and no convincing evidence of a difference in disease severity between subtypes. RSV-specific interventions will need to be equally effective against both RSV-A and RSV-B to have the greatest impact on reducing severe RSV disease in this population.","Saravanos, Gemma L; Ramos, Isabelle; Britton, Philip N; Wood, Nicholas J",Journal of paediatrics and child health,331,16

However, substantial interobserver variability impairs outcome assessment as well as reduces power of clinical trials. Guided by the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, we developed a comprehensive, hierarchical assessment tool (miFUNCTION) to address the shortcomings of the modified Rankin Scale and deliver a more thorough understanding of disability following stroke. METHODS The initial construct validity of miFUNCTION was established in a pilot study of patients at an outpatient stroke prevention clinic that had been diagnosed with stroke within 60 days. To further assess criterion validity, miFUNCTION was compared against the modified Rankin Scale and other outcome measures within the Endovascular Treatment for Small Core and Anterior Circulation Proximal Occlusion With Emphasis on Minimizing CT to Recanalization Times (ESCAPE) trial. Logistic regression analysis with miFUNCTION as an outcome was used to demonstrate the beneficial effect of endovascular treatment. RESULTS The pilot study showed moderate inter-observer agreement (k = 0.585, p < 0.005) but near perfect correlation between miFUNCTION and modified Rankin Scale (ρ = 0.821, p < 0.05). The correlation of miFUNCTION and modified Rankin Scale was near perfect again in the ESCAPE trial (ρ = 0.944). Effect size of the multivariable models using modified Rankin Scale (adjusted odds ratio: 3.45, 95% confidence interval: 2.05-5.78) and miFUNCTION (adjusted odds ratio: 3.32, 95% confidence interval: 1.99-5.55) as an outcome measure for the ESCAPE trial patients was similar. CONCLUSIONS miFUNCTION is strongly associated with the degree of disability following stroke both in an outpatient setting and a clinical trial. Further work remains to assess sensitivity to change and to improve the inter-observer reliability of the scale.","Zerna, Charlotte; Burley, Tyler; Green, Theresa L; Dukelow, Sean P; Demchuk, Andrew M; Hill, Michael D",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,331,7

The aim of our study was to investigate the vancomycin removal during hemoperfusion (HP) using HA380 cartridge. METHODS This is an experimental study, in which 500 mL of solution was circulated in a closed-circuit (blood flow of 250 mL/min) simulating HP ran using HA380. Vancomycin was added to reach a through concentration or a very high concentration to evaluate the removal ratio (RR) during 120 min of HP. Comparison between blood-crystalloid solution and balanced solution was performed by using Kruskal-Wallis test. The kinetics of vancomycin removal and the adsorption isotherm were evaluated. RESULTS We found a complete removal of vancomycin at baseline through concentration of 23.0 ± 7.4 mg/L. Using extremely high concentration (baseline 777.0 ± 62.2 mg/L), RR was 90.1 ± 0.6% at 5 min and 99.2 ± 0.6% at 120 min. No difference in terms of RR was found between blood-crystalloid mixture and balanced solution. The kinetics of the vancomycin reduction followed an exponential decay. Repeated boluses (total amount of 2,000 mg) resulted in cumulative adsorption of 1,919.4 mg with RR of 96.6 ± 1.4%, regardless of the amount injected (100 vs. 500 mg). Vancomycin adsorption onto HA380 followed the Langmuir isotherm model. CONCLUSIONS A considerable amount of vancomycin was rapidly removed during in vitro HP with HA380. Clinical studies are needed to determine whether this may lead to underdosing. Drug therapeutic monitoring is highly recommended when using HA380 for blood purification in patients receiving vancomycin.","Godi, Ilaria; Lorenzin, Anna; De Rosa, Silvia; Golino, Gianlorenzo; Knust, Maira; Gaspar, Ana; Sandini, Alessandra; Fiorin, Francesco; de Cal, Massimo; Navalesi, Paolo; Ronco, Claudio",Nephron,331,12

OBJECTIVES The anti-inflammatory and anti-catabolic actions of Diclofenac were compared with apigenin-C-glycosides rich Clinacanthus nutans (CN) leaf extract in osteoporotic-osteoarthritis rats. METHODS Female Sprague Dawley rats were randomized into five groups (n = 6). Four groups were bilateral ovariectomised for osteoporosis development, and osteoarthritis were induced by intra-articular injection of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) into the right knee joints. The Sham group was sham-operated, received saline injection and deionized drinking water. The treatment groups were orally given 200 or 400 mg extract/kg body weight or 5 mg diclofenac /kg body weight daily for 28 days. Articular cartilage and bone changes were monitored by gross and histological structures, micro-CT analysis, serum protein biomarkers, and mRNA expressions for inflammation and catabolic protease genes. RESULTS HPLC analysis confirmed that apigenin-C-glycosides (shaftoside, vitexin, and isovitexin) were the major compounds in the extract. The extract significantly and dose-dependently reduced cartilage erosion, bone loss, cartilage catabolic changes, serum osteoporotic-osteoarthritis biomarkers (procollagen-type-II-N-terminal-propeptide PIINP; procollagen-type-I-N-terminal-propeptide PINP; osteocalcin), inflammation (IL-1β) and mRNA expressions for nuclear-factor-kappa-beta NF-κβ, interleukin-1-beta IL-1β, cyclooxygenase-2; and matrix-metalloproteinase-13 MMP13 activities, in osteoporotic-osteoarthritis rats comparable to Diclofenac.

The increased apoptosis is associated with higher expression of programmed death-1 (PD-1) on gB-Tet(-) CD8(+) T cells and the interaction with PD-1 ligand (PD-L1/B7-H1). IFN-γ regulated expression of the PD-1 ligand (PD-L1/B7-H1) on neurons bearing higher copies of latent viral genome. In latently infected TG of B7-H1(-/-) mice, the number and frequency of PD-1(+) gB-Tet(-) CD8(+) T cells increases dramatically, but gB-Tet(-) CD8(+) T cells remain largely nonfunctional and do not provide increased protection from HSV-1 reactivation in ex vivo cultures of latently infected TG. Unlike observations in some chronic infection models, B7-H1 blockade did not increase the function of exhausted gB-Tet(-) CD8 T cells in latently infected TG.","Jeon, Sohyun; St Leger, Anthony J; Cherpes, Thomas L; Sheridan, Brian S; Hendricks, Robert L",Journal of immunology,331,1

This study was undertaken to document late outcomes after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. METHODS Five hundred ten patients underwent laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication >10 years ago and were prospectively followed. Preoperatively and postoperatively, patients scored the frequency and severity of symptoms (from 0 = never/not bothersome to 10 = always/very bothersome). Symptom scores before and after fundoplication were compared. Median symptom scores are presented. RESULTS Early after fundoplication, significant improvements were noted in the frequency and severity of symptoms (e.g., for heartburn, from 8 to 0 and from 8 to 0, respectively, P < .001 for each). Late after fundoplication, significant improvements were maintained in the palliation of symptoms (e.g., frequency and severity for heartburn, 2, 1; respectively). At latest follow-up, 89% of patients were pleased with their symptom resolution. CONCLUSIONS With long-term follow-up, laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication durably and significantly palliates symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Given these limitations, we use a Community Cultural Wealth (CCW) (Yosso, 2005) framework to describe how muxeres, Latina women who identify as promotoras, madres, and mamás, leveraged their political power and culturally informed leadership to improve the health and well-being of their communities. We highlight instances from our fieldwork, witnessing the agency of muxeres en acción for health equity. We offer three case studies to describe how we approached our collaborations with three groups of muxeres situated in different geographic locations in the state of California. The first case study discusses how immigrant muxeres who identify as promotoras (e.g., health workers) in the Central Valley developed their research skills through a promotora model that allowed them to build the capacity to advocate for the well-being of their communities. The second example offers reflections from a Community-Based Participatory Action Research (CBPAR) project with a group of Mexican immigrant madres in a gentrified community in San José. Lastly, the third case study describes how a group of mamás in the East Side of Los Angeles addressed issues of educational inequities. Together, these case studies illustrate muxeres' advocacy for their health and well-being. Because women in general, and muxeres in particular, are considered gatekeepers of culture and tradition within their families, it is crucial that community psychologists ground their work in ethically and culturally appropriate frameworks that highlight the power of muxeres.","Fernández, Jesica Siham; Guzmán, Bianca L; Bernal, Ireri; Flores, Yvette G",American journal of community psychology,331,4

Key considerations are highlighted to enable safe and effective implementation of remote virtual consultations, along with the advantages and disadvantages of each method. These include patient consent, confidentiality, data sharing and protection, professionalism, student agreements and data gathering templates. It is hoped that sharing of these methods of virtual consulting will support the ongoing delivery of Primary Care education across medical schools.","Taggar, Jaspal; Saha, Runa; Hopwood-Carr, Paula; Patel, Bakula; Johnson, Christine","Education for primary care : an official publication of the Association of Course Organisers, National Association of GP Tutors, World Organisation of Family Doctors",331,16

The purpose of this study was to evaluate differences in technique and results of taIPAA in three centers performing taIPAA across two continents. METHODS Prospective IPAA registries from three institutions in the US and Europe were queried for patients undergoing taIPAA. Demographic, preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data were compiled into a single database and evaluated. RESULTS Sixty-two patients (median age 38 years; range 16-68 years, 43 (69%) male) underwent taIPAA in the three centers (USA 24, UK 23, Italy 15). Most patients had had a subtotal colectomy before taIPAA [n = 55 (89%)]. Median surgical time was 266 min (range 180-576 min) and blood loss 100 ml (range 10-500 ml). Technical variations across the three institutions included proctectomy plane of dissection (intramesorectal or total mesorectal excision plane), specimen extraction site (future ileostomy site vs. anus), ileo-anal anastomosis technique (stapled vs. hand sewn) and use of fluorescence angiography. Despite technical differences, anastomotic leak rates (5/62; 8%) and overall complications (18/62; 29%) were acceptable across the three centers. CONCLUSIONS This is the first collaborative report showing safety and feasibility of taIPAA. Despite technical variations, outcomes are similar across centers.

To meet the rising service demands, more trainees and established consultants need to learn the technique. We sought to establish whether it is feasible and safe to train on a large proportion of patients without adversely affecting clinical outcome or smooth running of clinical service. METHODS Between September 2006 and July 2008, four senior trainees of the Wessex Specialist Registrar training rotation were involved in training in laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Major colorectal resections were separated into clearly defined modules for training purposes. Right and left hemicolectomies each comprised two modules, and low anterior resection comprised three modules. Prospective data on consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery were collected. Data included type of surgery, module of procedure performed by trainee or trainer, body mass index (BMI), conversion rates, median operative time, complications, length of hospital stay, and mortality. RESULTS During the study period 227 colorectal resections were attempted laparoscopically. Of these, 216 (96%) proved suitable for training and 97% were completed laparoscopically. Some 23% of patients were American Society of Anesthesiologists score (ASA)≥3; 35% had a BMI≥28; 38% had a history of previous laparotomy. Trainees performed 96% (142/148) of right hemicolectomy modules, 99% (154/156) of left hemicolectomy modules, and 67% (128/192) of rectal resection modules. Each trainee was competent to do right and left hemicolectomy at the end of the training period. Four patients (2%) required further surgery for postoperative complications. Of the procedures completed by the trainees, 155/171 (91%) cancer resections were potentially surgically curative, and R0 resections were achieved in 99%. The readmission rate was 10% (22/216) and median length of hospital stay was 4 days. Postoperative mortality was zero. CONCLUSIONS Using a modular approach it is possible to provide effective training during almost all laparoscopic colorectal resections while achieving good clinical outcomes for the patients.","Hemandas, Anil; Flashman, Karen G; Farrow, Jill; O'Leary, Daniel P; Parvaiz, Amjad",World journal of surgery,331,1

OBJECTIVE The aim of this review was to investigate the potential effects of glucose and sucrose, compared with placebo, on cognition in healthy humans. DATA SOURCES The electronic databases PubMed and Web of Science were searched up to December 2019. Reference lists of selected articles were checked manually. STUDY SELECTION Randomized controlled trials or crossover trials that compared glucose or sucrose with placebo for effects on cognition were eligible. DATA EXTRACTION Potentially eligible articles were selected independently by 2 authors. Risk of bias was assessed through the Cochrane Collaboration tool. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were obtained from random-effects meta-analyses for a subsample of studies that reported the same outcomes. RESULTS Thirty-seven trials were identified, of which 35 investigated the effect of glucose consumption compared with placebo on cognition. Two studies found no effect of glucose on cognition, while the others found mixed results. Only 3 of the 37 studies investigated the effects of sucrose intake, reporting mixed results. Meta-analyses revealed a significantly positive effect of glucose compared with control, but only when a verbal performance test (immediate word recall) was used in parallel-design studies (SMD = 0.61; 95%CI, 0.20-1.02; I2 = 0%). Twenty-four studies were classified as having high risk of bias for the selection procedure. CONCLUSIONS A limited body of evidence shows a beneficial effect of glucose in individuals performing immediate verbal tasks.

To explore the impact of intervention measures on the COVID-19 epidemic, we established SEIR models to predict the epidemic characteristics of COVID-19 at four different phases (beginning, outbreak, recession, and plateau) from January 1st, 2020, to March 30th, 2020. We found that the infection rate rapidly grew up to 0.3647 at phase II from 0.1100 at phase I and went down to 0.0600 and 0.0006 at phase III and IV, respectively. The reproduction numbers of COVID-19 were 10.7843, 13.8144, 1.4815, and 0.0137 at phase I, II, III, and IV, respectively. These results suggest that intensive interventions, including compulsory home isolation and rapid improvement of medical resources, can effectively reduce the COVID-19 transmission. Furthermore, the predicted COVID-19 epidemic trend by our models was close to the actual epidemic trend in Wuhan.

Our objective was to compare short-term intra and post-operative complication rates of bilateral total salpingectomy versus partial salpingectomy performed during the course of a cesarean delivery. METHODS A large series of tubal sterilizations during cesarean sections were studied in a single tertiary medical center between 1/2014 and 8/2016 before and after a policy change was made, switching from partial salpingectomy to total salpingectomy. Patients who underwent bilateral partial salpingectomy using the modified Pomeroy technique were compared with those who underwent total salpingectomy. Operative length, estimated blood loss, postpartum fever, wound infection, need for re-laparotomy, hospitalization length, and blood transfusions were compared. RESULTS During the study period, 149 women met inclusion criteria. Fifty parturients underwent bilateral total salpingectomy and 99 underwent partial salpingectomy in the course of the cesarean section. Demographic, obstetrical, and surgical characteristics were similar in both groups. Mean cesarean section duration was comparable for partial salpingectomy and total salpingectomy (a median of 35 min in both groups, P = 0.92). Complications were rare in both groups with no significant differences in rates of postpartum fever, wound infection, re-laparotomy, hospitalization length, estimated blood loss, transfusions, and readmissions within 1-month postpartum. CONCLUSION Rates of short-term complications are similar in patients undergoing bilateral partial salpingectomy and total salpingectomy during cesarean deliveries, making the latter a feasible alternative to the former.","Shinar, Shiri; Blecher, Yair; Alpern, Sharon; Many, Ariel; Ashwal, Eran; Amikam, Uri; Cohen, Aviad",Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,331,27

Safety and Efficacy of NeuroFlo Technology in Ischemic Stroke (SENTIS), the largest randomized controlled trial of device therapy to date, tested the potential augmentation of collateral perfusion. SYNTHESIS Expansion, Mechanical Retrieval and Recanalization of Stroke Clots Using Embolectomy (MR RESCUE), and Interventional Management of Stroke (IMS) III chronicled the saga of endovascular therapy trialed against medical treatment for acute ischemic stroke. These recent randomized studies, however, largely neglect current device technology available for endovascular therapy as advanced by the TREVO2 and SOLITAIRE™(TM) FR With the Intention For Thrombectomy (SWIFT) studies. Such exhaustive efforts in recent trials have failed to introduce a new treatment for stroke that unequivocally improves patient outcomes. Collateral perfusion is widely recognized to vary across individuals in any population and exerts a dramatic effect on baseline variables including the time course of ischemic injury, stroke severity, imaging findings, and therapeutic opportunities. Similarly, collaterals have been recognized to influence recanalization, reperfusion, hemorrhagic transformation, and subsequent neurological outcomes after stroke. Collateral lessons may be gleaned from these trials, to expand consideration of overall study results and perhaps most importantly, alter ongoing and new trials in development. Detailed analyses of available information on collaterals from these trials demonstrate that collaterals may be more influential than the choice of treatment modality or intervention.","Liebeskind, David S",Neurological research,331,1

DESIGN AND METHODS The incidence rates per 100,000 inhabitants and the case fatality ratio (CFR) (dependent variables) in all Italian regions were calculated in January 2021 at John Hopkins University Coronavirus Center. The independent variables were: -Minimum average temperatures in the same month (January) of 2020, -Average pollution of PM10 in the air in each region in the last year available reported on a 0-10 scale to 0 = total absence of PM10 to 10 maximum pollutions. -Number of places in hotels occupied per inhabitants in 2020. Linear regression and Multiple Regression Analysis were carried out. RESULTS The spread of the COVID-19 in the Italian regions seems to be related to pollution of PM10, the number of beds occupied in hotels (as an index of mobility and temperature (indirect correlation). On the contrary, the CFR correlates inversely with temperature but not with pollution. Measuring the concomitant effect of two independent variables by means of Multiple Regression Analysis, temperature and pollution show a synergistic effect on COVID-19 incidence. CONCLUSIONS The study seems to confirm the literature on the influence of temperature on the lethality of COVID-19 but adds the new results of an inverse relationship between the spread of the virus and low temperature in regions between the Mediterranean area (which includes southern Italy and Sicily and Sardinia islands) and the cold European temperate zone which includes the northern regions under the Alps. A new date also concerns the summation effect of the risk between cold weather and PM10 air pollution was found. Due to several methodic weakness the study has an exploratory than conclusive relevance.","Carta, Mauro Giovanni; Minerba, Luigi; Demontis, Roberto; Orrù, Germano; Romano, Ferdinando; Scano, Alessandra; Restivo, Angelo; Del Giacco, Stefano; Deidda, Simona; Firnu, Davide; Campagna, Marcello; Meloni, Federico; Cossu, Giulia; Sancassiani, Federica; Chessa, Luchino; Kalcev, Goce; Littera, Roberto; Zorcolo, Luigi; Aviles-Gonzale, Cesar Ivan; Usai, Paolo",Journal of public health research,331,24

CD24 is primarily expressed by immune cells but is often overexpressed in human tumors. In cancer, CD24 is a regulator of cell migration, invasion, and proliferation. Its expression is associated with poor prognosis and it is used as cancer stemness marker. Recently, CD24 on tumor cells was identified as a phagocytic inhibitor (""don't eat me"" signal) having a suppressive role in tumor immunity via binding to Siglec-10 on macrophages. This finding is reminiscent of the demonstration that soluble CD24-Fc can dampen the immune system in autoimmune disease. In the present review, we summarize recent progress on the role of the CD24-Siglec-10 binding axis at the interface between tumor cells and the immune system, and the role of CD24 genetic polymorphisms in cancer. We describe the specific function of cytoplasmic CD24 and discuss the presence of CD24 on tumor-released extracellular vesicles. Finally, we evaluate the potential of CD24- based immunotherapy.

METHODS Three anthropomorphic thorax phantoms were filled with (201)Tl. For each phantom five repeated (201)Tl MPS were obtained. In addition, in 20 patients repeated (201)Tl rest-MPS and in 26 patients early and delayed (201)Tl rest-MPS were performed. Quantitative analysis was done using MunichHeart. Statistical methods were used to calculate variability. Visual analysis was performed by 2 independent observers. RESULTS The average variation between repeated phantom MPS was 0.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.4% to 1.4%). For patient scans this was -5.0% (95% CI: -2.5% to -7.5%) and between early and delayed (201)Tl MPS -15.5% (95% CI: -11.7% to -19.3%). Visual assessment revealed no clinical significant differences between rest (201)Tl and repeated or delayed (201)Tl MPS. CONCLUSIONS Repositioning in phantom (201)Tl MPS does not cause significant variation. Repeated (201)Tl MPS in patients shows 5.0% decrease of (201)Tl in 30 minutes, which increases to 15% during a two-hour time interval without quantitative or visual regional differences. This decrease indicates a time-related washout of (201)Tl, but does not change clinical diagnosis.","Backus, Barbra E; Verburg, Frederik A; Romijn, R Leo; Konijnenberg, Mark W; Beekman, Freek J; Verzijlbergen, J Fred",Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology,331,28

MATERIALS AND METHODS Prospective data from 35 consecutive cases using CPM were compared with retrospective data of all cases using TVE from December 2014 to January 2017. Patients were matched 1:1 based on myoma diameter. A total of 62 women were included in the final analysis. Specimen retrieval was performed using the TVE or CPM within an insufflated isolation bag. RESULTS Age, body mass index, mode of prior obstetric delivery, history of previous abdominal surgery, indication for myomectomy, and the myoma(s) characteristics were similar between groups. Retrieval time was significantly shorter in the TVE group compared with the CPM group: 10 minutes (3-15 minutes) versus 17 minutes (14-42 minutes); P < .001. Time required for placement of the instruments was 9.7 minutes for the isolation bag and 0.5 minutes for the vaginal extractor. Additional analgesic administration for pain relief was necessary in 13 patients (42%) in the TVE group and 23 patients (72%) in the CPM group ( P = .01). Total cost of the hospital stay was significantly higher in the CPM group compared with the TVE group ( P < .001). Estimated blood loss and duration of hospital stay were similar between groups. CONCLUSION Both CPM and TVE can be used for safe retrieval of large myomas that are removed laparoscopically. Compared with CPM, TVE was associated with a shorter retrieval time, less postoperative pain, and less hospital costs.","Boza, Aysen; Misirlioglu, Selim; Taskiran, Cagatay; Urman, Bulent",Surgical innovation,331,16

Intervention programs to prevent e-cigarette initiation administered by authority figures are met with more resistance from youth compared to peer-led programs. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and implementation process of using social network analysis (SNA) to identify student peer leaders in schools and train them to deliver e-cigarette prevention programming to their peers. Nine schools were recruited to participate in the study during the 2019-2020 school year. Schools were assigned to one of three conditions: (1) expert; (2) peer-random (selected peer-leaders would teach to random students); and (3) peer-fixed (selected peer-leaders would teach to assigned students based on nominations). Study participation varied by day due to school attendance, with 686 participants at baseline and 608 at posttest. Almost all students who did not complete the study resulted from the interruption of schools being closed due to COVID-19. Implementation issues fell into three categories: (1) scheduling, (2) day-of logistics, and (3) student group dynamics. Overall, the results showed positive satisfaction among teachers, who unanimously found the program appropriate for the grade-level and that peer-leaders worked well within their groups. Peer-led students-both random and assigned-reported having more fun and willing to tell friends to try the program compared to expert-led students. This study demonstrated the feasibility of implementing a peer-led e-cigarette prevention program for 6th grade students, using SNA to provide intervention rigidity and validity.","Chu, Kar-Hai; Sidani, Jaime; Matheny, Sara; Rothenberger, Scott D; Miller, Elizabeth; Valente, Thomas; Robertson, Linda",Addictive behaviors,331,17

Notably, the recent development of the HCV cell culture infection system now allows not only for the study of the entire viral life cycle, but also for the screening of inhibitors against all aspects of HCV infection. However, in order to screen libraries of potential antiviral compounds, it is necessary to develop a highly reproducible, accurate assay for HCV infection adaptable for high-throughput screening (HTS) automation. Using an internally quenched 5-FAM/QXL 520 fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) substrate containing the HCV NS3 peptide cleavage sequence, we report the development of a simple, mix-and-measure, homogenous, cell-based HCV infection assay amendable for HTS. This assay makes use of synchronized, nondividing human hepatoma-derived Huh7 cells, which support more-reproducible long-term HCV infection and can be readily scaled down to a 96-well-plate format. We demonstrate that this stable cell culture method eliminates common problems associated with standard cell-based HTS, such as cell culture variability, poor reproducibility, and low signal intensity. Importantly, this HCV FRET assay not only can identify inhibitors that act throughout the viral life cycle as effectively as more-standard HCV assays, such as real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis, but also exhibits a high degree of accuracy with limited signal variation (i.e., Z' > or = 0.6), providing the basis for a robust HTS campaign for screening compound libraries and identifying novel HCV antivirals.","Yu, Xuemei; Sainz, Bruno; Uprichard, Susan L",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,331,20

Objective To elucidate the association between reperfusion and brain edema. The secondary objectives were to evaluate whether brain edema could partially be responsible for worse outcomes in patients with later reperfusion or lower Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score. Design, Setting, and Participants This was a post hoc analysis of the Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN), which was a prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical trial of endovascular treatment compared with conventional care of patients with acute anterior circulation ischemic stroke. Of 502 patients enrolled from December 2010 to June 2014, 2 patients declined to participate. Additionally, exclusion criteria were absence of follow-up imaging or presence of parenchymal hematoma, resulting in 462 patients included in this study. Brain edema was assessed retrospectively, from December 10, 2016, to July 24, 2017, by measuring midline shift (MLS) in all available follow-up scans. Observers were blinded to clinical data. Main Outcomes and Measures Midline shift was assessed as present or absent and as a continuous variable. Reperfusion status was assessed by the modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score in the endovascular treatment arm. The modified arterial occlusive lesion score was used to evaluate the recanalization status in both arms. The modified Rankin scale score at 90 days was used for functional outcome. Results Of 462 patients, the mean (SD) age was 65 (11) years, and 41.8% (n = 193) were women. Successful reperfusion and recanalization were associated with a reduced likelihood of having MLS (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.12-0.53; P < .001 and adjusted common odds ratio, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.21-0.55; P < .001, respectively). Midline shift was partially responsible for worse modified Rankin scale scores in patients without reperfusion or recanalization (MLS changed the logistic regression coefficients by 30.3% and 12.6%, respectively). In patients with delayed reperfusion or lower Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score, MLS mediated part of the worse modified Rankin scale scores, corresponding to a change in the regression coefficient of 33.3% and 64.2%, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance Successful reperfusion was associated with reduced MLS. This study identifies an additional benefit of reperfusion in relation to edema, as well as rescuing ischemic brain tissue at risk for infarction.

RECENT FINDINGS Although the use of ultrasound to assess the anatomy of the various abdominal organs is well established within radiology and critical care, its use as part of functional and physiological assessment is still evolving. Recent developments have extended the use of ultrasound beyond standard B-mode/2D imaging techniques to incorporate more functional and haemodynamic assessment. These include the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), elastography, and colour Doppler techniques. SUMMARY Whilst Doppler techniques are reasonably well established within critical care ultrasound (CCUS), especially in echocardiography, CEUS and elastography are less well known. CEUS utilizes a purely intravascular contrast agent whilst elastography measures the degree of deformation or stiffness in various organs. Whilst their use individually may be limited; they may play a role in a multiparametric assessment. Mirroring the overall trends in critical care ultrasound development, abdominal ultrasound assessment is best integrated in a holistic approach and adapted to the individual patient.","Wong, Adrian; Yusuf, Gibran Timothy; Malbrain, Manu L N G",Current opinion in critical care,331,19

METHODS We started to develop a pandemic plan to maintain oncological rehabilitation in February 2020. With the involvement of the whole clinic staff we developed protection scenarios with the aim of achieving Covid-19-free clinics. Schedules were developed and implemented based on the epidemiological bulletins of the RKI (Robert Koch Institute, Germany) of 2017 (influenza infection) and 2020 (Covid-19). The effects of these measures were evaluated by means of a patient and employee survey. RESULTS The challenges of the pandemic have been successfully implemented. Both the patient and employee surveys showed a high level of acceptance of the measures. For example, 98.5% of patients stated that the continuation of rehabilitation was important for their health, even in the pandemic situation. At the same time, 87% felt safe. 88% of all employees (MA) and 93% of MA in the risk group stated that the protective measures were introduced at the right time. At the same time, 76% of all employees and 84% of the employees in the risk group agreed with the additional burden. In spite of the high risk potential in the clinics (immunocompromised patients, patients from different districts with different levels of exposure), an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 could be avoided in the clinics. CONCLUSION The timely roll-out of adapted pandemic rules in rehabilitation clinics enables the continuation of high-quality oncological rehabilitation even in pandemic times and thus contributes to a stabilisation of the supply chain for cancer diseases. A high level of acceptance of the measures among patients and hospital staff was evaluated.","Leibbrand, Birgit; Seifart, Ulf",Die Rehabilitation,331,20

We review our experience with balloon-augmented Onyx embolization of cerebral AVMs using a dual-lumen balloon catheter technique designed to minimize these challenges. METHODS Retrospectively acquired data for all balloon-augmented cerebral AVM embolizations performed between 2011 and 2014 were obtained from four tertiary care centers. For each procedure, at least one Scepter C balloon catheter was advanced into the AVM arterial pedicle of interest and Onyx embolization was performed through the inner lumen after balloon inflation via the outer lumen. RESULTS Twenty patients underwent embolization with the balloon-augmented technique over 24 discreet treatment episodes. There were 37 total arterial pedicles embolized with the balloon-augmented technique, a mean of 1.9 per patient (range 1-5). The treated AVMs were heterogeneous in their location and size (mean 3.3±1.6 cm). Mean fluoroscopy time for each procedure was 48±26 min (28 min per embolized pedicle). Two Scepter C balloon catheter-related complications (8.3% of embolization sessions, 5.4% of pedicles embolized) were observed: an intraprocedural rupture of a feeding pedicle and fracture and retention of a catheter fragment. CONCLUSIONS This multicenter experience represents the largest reported series of balloon-augmented Onyx embolization of cerebral AVMs. The technique appears safe and effective in the treatment of AVMs, allowing more efficient and controlled injection of Onyx with a decreased risk of reflux and decreased fluoroscopy times.","Spiotta, Alejandro M; James, Robert F; Lowe, Stephen R; Vargas, Jan; Turk, Aquilla S; Chaudry, M Imran; Bhalla, Tarun; Janjua, Rashid M; Delaney, John J; Quintero-Wolfe, Stacey; Turner, Raymond D",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,331,19

I study whether health information technology (HIT) complements patient prescription data in PDMPs to reduce opioid-related mortality and morbidity. A novel dataset is constructed that records state policies that integrate PDMP with HIT and facilitate interstate data sharing. Using difference-in-differences models, I find that PDMP-HIT integration policies reduce opioid-related inpatient morbidity. The reductions are substantial in states that established integration without ever mandating the use of a PDMP. A mechanism test suggests that PDMP integration works mainly through the hospital system while a mandate affects legal opioids prescription. The impacts from integration are strongest for the vulnerable groups-middle-aged, low-to middle-income patients, and those with public insurance. There is suggestive evidence that interstate data sharing further complements integration despite not having a significant impact independently. The results are robust to a set of tests using alternative specifications and measures. The total benefits from integration far exceed the associated costs.","Wang, Lucy Xiaolu",Health economics,331,16

Data are insufficient to conclude which type of mesh affords the greatest benefit. Our aim was to compare the outcomes of LVR using a non-cross-linked biologic versus a permanent mesh. METHODS Twenty nine cases of LVR with permanent mesh were matched based on age and surgical indication with an equal number of patients using biologic mesh. Cases were retrospectively reviewed from a prospectively maintained database. Symptom resolution, patient satisfaction and recurrence of prolapse were measured among those who underwent LVR with either a biologic (Biodesign(®), Cook Medical) or polypropylene mesh. RESULTS Age, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class, surgical indication and primary symptoms were not different between the two groups. After a median follow-up of 15.4 months, all patients reported being either completely or partially satisfied. Rates of complete or partial symptom resolution (p = 0.26) or satisfaction (p = 0.27) did not differ between groups. After LVR, similar rates of additional procedures were performed in the biologic (21 %) and the permanent (28 %) mesh group. Among patients with full-thickness prolapse (n = 33), there were five cases (15 %) of recurrence, one in the biologic group and four in the permanent mesh group (p = 0.37). There were no mesh-related complications in either group. CONCLUSIONS LVR using a non-cross-linked biologic mesh appears to have comparable rates of symptom improvement and patient satisfaction in the short term. Longer follow-up will be required to determine if prolapse recurrence depends on mesh type.","Ogilvie, James W; Stevenson, Andrew R L; Powar, Michael",International journal of colorectal disease,331,1

Electrical impedance values of emulsions obtained at different emulsification speeds were estimated according to the frequency response data with frequencies ranging from 1 MHz to 1 Hz. The equivalent circuit model of toluene-in-water emulsion was established by the resistor (RO/W) and capacitor (CO/W) in parallel connection. Nyquist diagrams for the emulsions prepared by toluene and water were characterized by the formation of one semi-circle. The droplet size distribution is one of the important factors that affect the stability of the emulsion, except for the volume fraction of water and oil, the size of stabilizing particles, etc. The average particle size of the emulsion droplets decreased as the emulsification speed increased, indicating the higher stability of the emulsion. It was found that the fitted impedance value RO/W of the emulsion decreased with decreasing particle size prepared at different emulsification speeds and storage time by performing real-time EIS detection techniques. The results suggested that EIS could be used to characterize the stability of a toluene-in-water emulsion stabilized by FcA modified silica nanoparticles. Moreover, based on the good electrochemical activity of the FcA molecule, the stability of the Pickering emulsion can be modulated by adding oxidant and reductant and detected by EIS in real-time.","Jiang, Qiuyan; Sun, Ning; Kumar, Parveen; Li, Qiuhong; Liu, Bo; Li, Aixiang; Wang, Weiwei; Gao, Zengli",Molecules,331,29

We compared residents (3,559,694 on 1 January 2020) in such occupations aged 20-70 years (mean: 44.1; standard deviation: 14.3 years; 51% men) to age-matched individuals in other professions using logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, birth country and marital status.ResultsNurses, physicians, dentists and physiotherapists had 2-3.5 times the odds of COVID-19 during the first wave when compared with others of working age. In the second wave, bartenders, waiters, food counter attendants, transport conductors, travel stewards, childcare workers, preschool and primary school teachers had ca 1.25-2 times the odds of infection. Bus, tram and taxi drivers had an increased odds of infection in both waves (odds ratio: 1.2-2.1). Occupation was of limited relevance for the odds of severe infection, here studied as hospitalisation with the disease.ConclusionOur findings from the entire Norwegian population may be of relevance to national and regional authorities in handling the epidemic.

The purpose of this study was to identify potential financial implications of continued telehealth use in hand and wrist surgery clinical practice. METHODS Two hundred telehealth visits were randomly selected and matched 1:1 based on primary diagnosis code to in-person visits. Medical and billing records were reviewed to compare visit complexities, total visit charges, work relative value units (wRVUs), and approved insurance reimbursement. Postoperative visits and visits with radiographic evaluation were excluded. RESULTS Level 4 visits were more common with in-person encounters compared to telehealth (11% vs 2%, respectively), and level 1 and 2 visits were more common with telehealth compared to in-person encounters (14% vs 6%, respectively). Twenty-seven in-person visits (13%) had at least 1 additional procedure code billed. The mean total visit charge was 26% less in telehealth compared to in-person. Based on the primary procedure code alone, the sum of wRVUs was 15.1 points less in the telehealth cohort compared to in-person (per visit average, 1.1 [telehealth] vs 1.2 [in-person]). The 28 additional services provided during in-person visits accounted for an added 20.7 wRVUs. Unpaid claims were more common among telehealth encounters (8% [telehealth] vs 3% [in-person]). CONCLUSIONS Higher complexity visits and visits with additional procedural codes billed were more common with in-person visits. This led to a lower number of total wRVUs and lower total visit charges among the included telehealth visits compared to the matched in-person controls. CLINICAL RELEVANCE It is important to understand and consider the long-term financial impact of telehealth implementation. Practices must develop strategies to incorporate radiographic evaluation into telehealth visits and effectively stratify those patients that may require procedural interventions for in-person visits. Understanding the economic implications of this changing care delivery paradigm, providers can continue to provide telehealth services while protecting the financial sustainability of hand surgery practices.","Tadley, Madeline; Henry, Tyler W; Horan, Dylan P; Beredjiklian, Pedro K",The Journal of hand surgery,331,22

METHOD For 17 patients with pancreatic carcinoma, dynamic dual-source DECT acquisitions were performed at 80kVp/Sn140kVp every 1.5 s over 51 s. Virtual monoenergetic images (VMI) were reconstructed for photon energies between 40 keV and 150 keV (5 keV steps). Using the maximum-slope model, perfusion maps of blood flow were calculated from VMIs and 80kVp images and compared quantitatively with regard to blood flow measured in regions of interest in healthy tissue and carcinoma, standard deviation (SD), and absolute-difference-to-standard-deviation ratio (ADSDR) of measurements. RESULTS On average, blood flow calculated from VMIs increased with increasing energy levels from 114.3 ± 37.2 mL/100 mL/min (healthy tissue) and 45.6 ± 25.3 mL/100 mL/min (carcinoma) for 40 keV to 128.6 ± 58.9 mL/100 mL/min (healthy tissue) and 75.5 ± 49.8 mL/100 mL/min (carcinoma) for 150 keV, compared to 114.2 ± 37.4 mL/100 mL/min (healthy tissue) and 46.5 ± 26.6 mL/100 mL/min (carcinoma) for polyenergetic 80kVp. Differences in blood flow between tissue types were significant for all energies. Differences between perfusion maps calculated from VMIs and 80kVp images were not significant below 110 keV. SD and ADSDR were significantly better for perfusion maps calculated from VMIs at energies between 40 keV and 55 keV than for those calculated from 80kVp images. Compared to effective dose of dynamic 80kVp acquisitions (4.6 ± 2.2mSv), dose of dynamic DECT/VMI acquisitions (8.0 ± 3.7mSv) was higher. CONCLUSIONS Perfusion maps of blood flow based on low-energy VMIs between 40 keV and 55 keV offer improved robustness and quality of quantitative measurements over those calculated from 80kVp image data (reference standard), albeit at increased patient radiation exposure.","Skornitzke, Stephan; Kauczor, Hans-Ulrich; Stiller, Wolfram",European journal of radiology,331,27

Better tissue contrast, more biocompatible contrast agents and the absence of any radiation for the patient are some of the many advantages of using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) rather than X-ray technology. But implantable medical devices cannot be visualized by conventional MRI and a tool therefore needs to be developed to rectify this. The synthesis of a new MRI-visible degradable polymer is described by grafting an MR contrast agent (DTPA-Gd) to a non-water-soluble, biocompatible and degradable poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL). The substitution degree, calculated by (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, is close to 0.5% and proves to be sufficient to provide a strong and clear T1 contrast enhancement. This new MRI-visible polymer was coated onto a commercial mesh for tissue reinforcement using an airbrush system and enabled in vitro MR visualization of the mesh for at least 1 year. A stability study of the DTPA-Gd-PCL chelate in phosphate-buffered saline showed that a very low amount of gadolinium was released into the medium over 52 weeks, guaranteeing the safety of the device. This study shows that this new MRI-visible polymer has great potential for the MR visualization of implantable medical devices and therefore the post-operative management of patients.","Blanquer, Sebastien; Guillaume, Olivier; Letouzey, Vincent; Lemaire, Laurent; Franconi, Florence; Paniagua, Cedric; Coudane, Jean; Garric, Xavier",Acta biomaterialia,331,1

AIM To examine associations between ethnicity and deprivation with timing of palliative care referral for inpatients with COVID-19. DESIGN Service evaluation of consecutive patients with COVID-19 referred to palliative care. Sociodemographic (including age, sex, Index of Multiple Deprivation, ethnicity coded as White/non-White) and clinical variables were described. The primary outcome was timing of referral to palliative care. Associations between ethnicity and socioeconomic deprivation with the primary outcome were explored using multivariable regression. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS Patients with COVID-19 referred to a hospital palliative care service across two London hospitals February-May 2020. RESULTS A total of 334 patients were included. 119 (36%) were from a non-White ethnic group; most commonly Black British (77, 23%) and Asian British (26, 8%). A longer time between admission and palliative care referral was associated with male gender (IRR 1.23, 95% CI 1.14-1.34) and lower levels of socioeconomic deprivation (IRR 1.61, 95% CI 1.36-1.90) but not ethnicity (IRR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.87-1.06). CONCLUSIONS This large service evaluation showed no evidence that patients from ethnic minority or more deprived socioeconomic groups had longer time to palliative care referral.

However, there is still a lack of evidence for the long-term outcome in distally located aneurysms in the M2 segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and beyond. METHODS Consecutive subjects (from June 2013 to August 2020) with MCA aneurysms in the M2 segment or beyond treated with FDS were reviewed retrospectively. The primary endpoints for clinical safety were the absence of mortality, stroke event, re-rupture of the aneurysm, and worsening of clinical symptoms. The primary endpoint for treatment efficacy was complete/near-complete occlusion at follow-up after 12 months. RESULTS 23 patients were identified: 7 aneurysms were located in the M2 segment of the MCA, 4 in the M2-M3 bifurcation, 2 in M3, 3 in M3-4 branching, and 2 in M4; 5 aneurysms were located in M2 with extension into the M1-M2 bifurcation. 13 aneurysms were of fusiform morphology, 8 sacculofusiform, and 2 saccular. 16 aneurysms were of highly suspected dissecting etiology. The median diameter of the parent vessel was 2.1 mm proximally and 2 mm distally. The median time of the follow-up was 30 months (range 16 months to 6 years). Complete/near complete occlusion was observed in 14/20 patients (70%) and one stable remodeling (5%) was seen at 12 months. 22 patients (95.6%) had an excellent clinical outcome (mRS 0-1) at 6 months. Technical challenges associated with the deployment of FDS occurred in 8.7% of cases. Severe complications, intraparenchymal hemorrhage and re-rupture of the aneurysm occurred in 2 patients (8.7%).

To investigate early development of embryonic muscles and the expression of regulatory genes during myogenesis in chicken, quail and their hybrids, meat-breeding cocks and egg-breeding cocks were selected as male parents, quails were used as female parents. Their offspring were meat and egg hybrids via Artificial insemination. We measured expression of MUSTN1, IGF-1, and PDK4 using qRT-PCR. We examined muscle fiber diameter using scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that muscle development was two days slower in chicken, egg hybrid, and meat hybrid than in quail. Muscle fiber spacing was the largest in chicken, followed by meat hybrid, egg hybrid, and quail. A similar trend was obtained for muscle fiber diameter. Additionally, muscle fiber diameter increased with embryogenesis. The sarcomere was present on day 17 of incubation in quail, but not in the other species. MUSTN1 could up-regulated IGF-1 by activating PI3K/Akt. IGF-1 expression was consistent with myoblast proliferation and myotube fusion. PDK4 was expressed from E7 to E17. The first peak was reached on E10, egg hybrid and meat hybrid reached their peak at E15. PDK4 is involved in the early proliferation and differentiation of muscle, thereby affecting muscle growth and development. Our findings demonstrated that MUSTN1, IGF-1 and PDK4 genes are expressed to varying levels in breast muscle of chicken, quail, egg hybrid and meat hybrid during the embryonic period. Interestingly, with increasing embryonic age, muscle development was approximately 48 hours faster in quail than in other species. We speculated that MUSTN1, IGF-1 and PDK4 genes may be the main candidate genes that cause differences in poultry muscle traits, but the molecular regulation mechanisms need to be further studied. Our findings shed some light on the avian embryo muscle formation and molecular breeding of poultry muscle traits, which provide theoretical basis for poultry breeding.","Zhu, Mengting; Wang, Mingyuan; Shao, Yanyan; Nan, Ying; Blair, Hugh T; Todd Morris, Stephen; Zhao, Zongsheng; Zhang, Hongmei",Gene,331,1

Neuronavigated TMS pulses were delivered over two individually defined nodes of the default mode (DMN) and dorsal attention (DAN) networks in a group of healthy subjects, with test-retest reliability assessed 1-month apart. TMS-evoked activity was predicted by the modularity and structural integrity of the stimulated network rather than the targeted region(s) or the whole-brain connectivity, suggesting network-level structural connectivity as more relevant than local brain properties in shaping TMS signal propagation.

STUDY SELECTION Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts and then full texts for eligibility. Ten publications were included. DATA EXTRACTION A single reviewer extracted data from the included publications and a second reviewer completed cross-checking. Qualitative data were extracted in five categories relating to the key factors influencing delivery of early mobilization to critically ill patients. DATA SYNTHESIS Methodological quality was appraised using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II tool. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II scores for applicability were low. Median quality scores for editorial independence, rigor of development, and stakeholder engagement were also poor. Narrative synthesis of publication content was undertaken. All publications supported implementation of early mobilization. Most documents agreed upon seven topics: 1) early mobilization is safe and may reduce healthcare costs, 2) safety criteria should be provided, 3) a protocolized or structured approach should be used, 4) collaborative teamwork is required, 5) staff require specific skills or experience, 6) patient and family engagement is important, and 7) program evaluation and outcome measurement are a key component of implementation. There was no consensus on dosage and patient selection. The areas of team culture and leadership were poorly addressed. CONCLUSIONS Despite significant variation in the methodological quality of clinical practice guidelines for early mobilization, there were important consistencies in recommendations internationally. Future research should address gaps related to patient selection, dosage, team culture, and expertise. Future clinical practice guidelines in this area should focus on engagement of patients and families in the development process and provision of resources to support implementation based on the consideration of known barriers and facilitators.","Lang, Jenna K; Paykel, Melanie S; Haines, Kimberley J; Hodgson, Carol L",Critical care medicine,331,16

Changing the carbon dioxide (CO(2)) tension in arterial blood is commonly used as a cerebral vasoactive stimulus to assess the cerebral vascular response, changing cerebral blood flow (CBF) by up to 5-11 percent/mmHg in normal adults. Here we describe two approaches to generating the CO(2) challenge using a computer-controlled gas blender to administer: i) a square wave change in CO(2) and, ii) a ramp stimulus, consisting of a continuously graded change in CO(2) over a range. Responses were assessed regionally by blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We studied 8 patients with known cerebrovascular disease (carotid stenosis or occlusion) and 2 healthy subjects. The square wave stimulus was used to study the dynamics of the vascular response, while the ramp stimulus assessed the steady-state response to CO(2). Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) maps were registered by color coding and overlaid on the anatomical scans generated with 3 Tesla MRI to assess the corresponding BOLD signal change/mmHg change in CO(2), voxel-by-voxel. Using a fractal temporal approach, detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) maps of the processed raw BOLD signal per voxel over the same CO(2) range were generated. Regions of BOLD signal decrease with increased CO(2) (coded blue) were seen in all of these high-risk patients, indicating regions of impaired CVR. All patients also demonstrated regions of altered signal structure on DFA maps (Hurst exponents less than 0.5; coded blue) indicative of anti-persistent noise. While 'blue' CVR maps remained essentially stable over the time of analysis, 'blue' DFA maps improved. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE This combined dual stimulus and dual analysis approach may be complementary in identifying vulnerable brain regions and thus constitute a regional as well as global brain stress test.","Mutch, W Alan C; Mandell, Daniel M; Fisher, Joseph A; Mikulis, David J; Crawley, Adrian P; Pucci, Olivia; Duffin, James",PloS one,331,29

In this systematic review and meta-analysis the evidence was evaluated for primary prevention of any viral respiratory tract infection (RTI) such as SARS-CoV-2, through supplementation of nutrients with a recognized role in immune function: multiple micronutrients, vitamin A, folic acid, vitamin B12, C, D, E, beta-carotene, zinc, iron and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. The search produced 15,163 records of which 93 papers (based on 115 studies) met the inclusion criteria, resulting in 199,055 subjects (191,636 children and 7,419 adults) from 37 countries. Sixty-three studies were included in the meta-analyses, which was performed for children and adults separately. By stratifying the meta-analysis by world regions, only studies performed in Asia showed a significant, but heterogeneous protective effect of zinc supplementation on RTIs (RR 0.86, 95%CI 0.7-0.96, I2=79.1%, p=0.000). Vitamin D supplementation in adults significantly decreased the incidence of RTI (RR 0.89, 95%CI 0.79-0.99, p=0.272), particularly in North America (RR 0.82 95%CI 0.68-0.97), but not in Europe or Oceania. Supplementation of nutrients in the general population has either no, or at most a very limited effect on prevention of RTIs.

Idiopathic chronic diarrhea (ICD) in rhesus macaques also resembles ulcerative colitis, one form of human inflammatory bowel disease. To test for viral etiologies, we characterized and compared the fecal viromes from 32 healthy animals, 31 animals with acute diarrhea, and 29 animals with ICD. The overall fractions of eukaryotic viral reads were 0.063% for the healthy group, 0.131% for the acute-diarrhea group, and 0.297% for the chronic-diarrhea group. Eukaryotic viruses belonging to 6 viral families, as well as numerous circular Rep-encoding single-stranded DNA (CRESS DNA) viral genomes, were identified. The most commonly detected sequences were from picornaviruses, making up 59 to 88% of all viral reads, followed by 9 to 17% for CRESS DNA virus sequences. The remaining 5 virus families, Adenoviridae, Astroviridae, Anelloviridae, Picobirnaviridae, and Parvoviridae, collectively made up 1 to 3% of the viral reads, except for parvoviruses, which made up 23% of the viral reads in the healthy group. Detected members of the families Picornaviridae and Parvoviridae were highly diverse, consisting of multiple genera, species, and genotypes. Coinfections with members of up to six viral families were detected. Complete and partial viral genomes were assembled and used to measure the number of matching short sequence reads in feces from the 92 animals in the two clinical and the healthy control groups. Several enterovirus genotypes and CRESS DNA genomes were associated with ICD relative to healthy animals. Conversely, higher read numbers from different parvoviruses were associated with healthy animals. Our study reveals a high level of enteric coinfections with diverse viruses in a captive rhesus macaque colony and identifies several viruses positively or negatively associated with ICD.","Kapusinszky, Beatrix; Ardeshir, Amir; Mulvaney, Usha; Deng, Xutao; Delwart, Eric",Journal of virology,331,7

A koronavírus-fertőzés 2019 végén indult útjára, lassan a Föld teljes lakosságát elérő pandémiaként. Egy olyan kórokozóról van szó, amely ilyen nagy számú megbetegedést még nem okozott, ezért annak természetes lefolyásáról, a szövődmények kialakulásáról és a kezelési lehetőségekről még keveset tudunk. Ennek következtében a kezdetben megjelent információk nagyon felületesek voltak, a következtetések nemritkán tévútra vezették mind az orvosokat, mind a betegeket. Az adatok gyarapodásával azonban egyre több kérdésre kapunk választ. Erre a folyamatra az egyik legreprezentánsabb példa az ibuprofén története, amely kezdetben tiltott, később tűrt terápiás szer volt, de ma már támogatott kezelési lehetőség a koronavírus-fertőzésben. Orv Hetil. 2020; 161(50): 2104-2106. Summary. The coronavirus infection started in late 2019, as a pandemic slowly reaching the entire population of the earth. This pathogen has not yet caused such a large number of diseases, so little is known about its natural course, the development of complications, and treatment options. As a result, the information initially published was very superficial, and the conclusions often misled both physicians and patients. As the data grows, however, we get more and more questions answered. One of the most representative examples of this process is the history of ibuprofen, which was initially banned, thereafter tolerated, and is now a supported treatment option for coronavirus infection.

Currently the overall incidence of health care associated infection has been increased and burden of these infections is staggering. This study aimed to assess health care workers compliance with standard precaution practices and associated factors in public health institutions of Dawuro zone, south west Ethiopia, 2016. METHODS An institution based cross sectional study was conducted from February1-30/ 2016 in 17 health institutions found in Dawuro zone. Data were collected using a pre-tested questionnaire on 250 health care workers selected by simple random sampling technique. Collected data was checked, coded and analyzed by using SPSS version 20. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULT Two hundred fifty health care workers were participated in the study. Out of the total respondents, 162(65.0%) of respondents had complied with standard precaution practices. Service year less than or equal to 5 years, training on standard precaution, having good hand hygiene and availability of personal protective equipment were independently associated with compliance to standard precaution practices. CONCLUSION Significant numbers of health care workers were not complied with standard precaution practices in this study. Therefore strategies targeted in fulfilling health institutions with supplies like hand hygiene material, Personal Protective equipment and training on standard precaution will improve compliance with standard precaution practice.","Beyamo, Abera; Dodicho, Terefe; Facha, Wolde",BMC health services research,331,12

Moreover, there is no study on the comparing the concentration of indoor air pollutants in different ORs. Therefore, this study aimed to measure and compare the benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) concentrations in the air of different ORs in hospitals of Sabzevar, Iran. Moreover, carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risk of exposure to these pollutants were assessed using Monte Carlo simulations technique. This cross-sectional study was based on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) passive sampling of eight ORs including General surgery, Curettage, Eye surgery, Neurosurgery, Orthopedic, Laparoscopic, Cesarean and Ear, nose, throat (ENT) in two monthly campaigns from November 2019 to February 2020. One-way ANOVA and Post-hoc analyses were used to compare the concentration of BTEX compounds in different ORs. The overall mean (standard deviation (SD)) of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene and total BTEX concentrations were 10.0 (1.8), 7.2 (1.9), 1.8 (0.6), 0.4 (0.2) and 19.4 (4.1) μg/m3. The Curettage OR had the highest (12.93 μg/m3) and ENT OR had the lowest (7.42 μg/m3) benzene concentrations. The highest concentrations of toluene, ethylbenzene and total BTEX were observed in General surgery OR. The cancer risks of exposure to benzene in all ORs were higher than the acceptable range recommended by Unite State Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA, 1 × 106). However, the hazard quotient (HQ) values for all ORs were at safe level (HQ < 1). Overall, our study suggested that the concentrations of BTEX compounds were significantly difference in different ORs and benzene had a carcinogenic risk for personnel and surgical staff in different ORs.","Moslem, Ali Reza; Rezaei, Hossein; Yektay, Sima; Miri, Mohammad",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,331,6

To control the spread of the pandemic and to choose a suitable treatment plan, a fast, accurate, effective, and ready-to-use diagnostic method has become an important prerequisite. In this Review, we introduce the principles of multiple off-site and on-site detection methods for virus diagnosis, including qPCR-based, ELISA-based, CRISPR-based methods, etc. All of these methods have been successfully implanted on the microfluidic platform for rapid screening. We also summarize currently available diagnostic methods for the detection of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Some of them not only can be used to analyze the SARS and MERS but also have the potential for COVID-19 detection after modifications. Finally, we hope that understanding of current microfluidic-based detection approaches can help physicians and researchers to develop advanced, rapid, and appropriate clinical detection techniques that reduce the financial expenditure of the society, accelerate the examination process, increase the accuracy of diagnosis, and eventually suppress the worldwide pandemic.","Mu, Hsuan-Yu; Lu, Yu-Lun; Hsiao, Tzu-Hung; Huang, Jen-Huang",Biomicrofluidics,331,17

Moreover, acquired resistance inevitably emerges, primarily due to RAF lesions that prevent inhibition of BRAF V600 with current treatments. Therefore, there is a need for new therapies that target other mechanisms of activated BRAF. In this study, we use the Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) technology, which promotes ubiquitination and degradation of neo-substrates, to address the limitations of BRAF inhibitor-based therapies. Using vemurafenib-based PROTACs, we achieve low nanomolar degradation of all classes of BRAF mutants, but spare degradation of WT RAF family members. Our lead PROTAC outperforms vemurafenib in inhibiting cancer cell growth and shows in vivo efficacy in a Class 2 BRAF xenograft model. Mechanistic studies reveal that BRAFWT is spared due to weak ternary complex formation in cells owing to its quiescent inactivated conformation, and activation of BRAFWT sensitizes it to degradation. This study highlights the degree of selectivity achievable with degradation-based approaches by targeting mutant BRAF-driven cancers while sparing BRAFWT, providing an anti-tumor drug modality that expands the therapeutic window.","Alabi, Shanique; Jaime-Figueroa, Saul; Yao, Zhan; Gao, Yijun; Hines, John; Samarasinghe, Kusal T G; Vogt, Lea; Rosen, Neal; Crews, Craig M",Nature communications,331,20

We aimed at evaluating viral load and T-cell responses to human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in a cohort of 25 MPN patients treated with ruxolitinib. EBV-DNA and HCMV-DNA was quantified monthly using real-time PCR on peripheral blood samples, and T-cell subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry. HCMV and EBV-directed T-cell responses were evaluated using the IFN-γ ELISPOT assay. Most patients had CD4+ and/or CD8+ T-cells below the normal range; these reductions were related to the duration of ruxolitinib treatment. In fact, reduced T-lymphocytes' subsets were found in 93% of patients treated for ≥5 years and in 45% of those treated for <5 years (P = 0.021). The former also had lower median numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ cells. Subclinical reactivation of EBV and HCMV occurred in 76% and 8% of patients. We observed a trend to an inverse relationship between EBV and CMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses and viral load, and a trend to an inverse correlation with ruxolitinib dose. So, our data suggest that ruxolitinib treatment may interfere with immunosurveillance against EBV and HCMV. This article is protected by copyright.

Gibbs free energy appears to be the critical factor of successful virus infection. A virus always has a more negative Gibbs free energy of growth than its host. Hence, the synthesis of viral components is thermodynamically favourable. On the other side, it could be essential to better thermodynamically understand how S1 and S2 spike protein interacts with the ACE2 receptors and the cell membrane more efficiently than the usual nutrients, which are intercepted. Gibbs energy gives a static model, which does not include the time arrow of viral evolution.

However, as of yet, there is little evidence indicating that the cognitive benefits of playing action video games generalize to naturalistic multisensory scenes – a fundamental characteristic of our natural, everyday life environments. The present study addressed the generalization of attentional control enhancement due to AVGP experience to real-life like scenarios by comparing the performance of action video-game players (AVGPs) with non-players (NVGPs) on a visual search task using naturalistic, dynamic audio-visual scenes. To this end, a questionnaire collecting data on gaming habits and sociodemographic data as well as a visual search task was administered online to a gender-balanced sample of 60 participants of age 18 to 30 years. According to the standard hypothesis, AVGPs outperformed NVGPs in the search task overall, showing faster reaction times without sacrificing accuracy. In addition, in replication of previous findings, semantically congruent cross-modal cues benefited performance overall. However, according to our results, despite the overall advantage in search, and the multisensory congruence benefit, AVGPs did not exploit multisensory cues more efficiently than NVGPs. Exploratory analyses with gender as a variable indicated that the advantage of AVG experience to both genders should be done with caution.","Hamzeloo, Mohammad; Kvasova, Daria; Soto-Faraco, Salvador",bioRxiv,331,1

Aims: To explore the K-6 symptoms network and its structure replication across the three types of disasters. Methods: A network analysis of psychological distress symptoms as assessed by the K-6 was conducted using data from 9,271 participants from different disaster samples: Terror (n = 5842), COVID-19 (n = 2428), and Nature related (n = 1001). Results: While there were extensive connections between items across all disaster samples, network structure differed across the disaster types. While after a nature related disaster and the COVID-19 pandemic depression- and anxiety- items were interconnected, a terror attack resulted in more separated manifestations of anxiety and depression. Centrality analysis showed depressed/no cheering up to be the node with the highest strength centrality in all networks; in the Nature-related network, restless or fidgety was also highly central. Conclusions: Results provide evidence of different psychological distress structures in different disasters.

Restrictions such as home quarantine and social restrictions due to Covid-19 pandemic have reduced women's access to the services that is effective on their reproductive health. In this study, the effect of Covid-19 pandemic on women's reproductive health issues was reviewed. Methods: In this narrative review, searches were performed in databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, Cochran library, and Farsi database of Magiran in 2019-2020 using the keywords including Covid-19, reproductive health, sexual satisfaction, mental health, domestic violence, childbearing, pregnancy, fertility, partner violence, maternal health, and family planning. Results: Covid-19 pandemic has different effects on reproductive health issues. Studies have shown an increase in the frequency of sexual intercourse due to increased presence of the spouse at home, but also there was a decrease in the quality of sexual intercourse due to the stress caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Also regarding women's mental health, an increase was observed in domestic violence as well as stress, anxiety and depression in women of reproductive age. Conclusion: In the pandemic high-risk situation, it is necessary that health care teams to focus more on women's reproductive issues and screen them in terms of mental health, domestic violence, sexual relationships, use of contraceptive methods and intending for childbearing. Providing virtual group educations and use of national media, could enhance the awareness of women of reproductive age.","Ardakani, Tayebeh Shojaaddini Poshti Bahare Amiri Tooran Poshti Banafshe Amiri Tooran",Journal of Midwifery &amp; Reproductive Health,331,1

To accurately assess this symptom burden, we developed a valid, reliable patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure of C19 symptoms combined with a known measure of cancer symptom burden. Methods: Within the institutional initiative on COVID-19 and cancer named Data- Driven Determinants for COVID-19 Oncology Discovery Effort (D3CODE), patients with cancer and PCR-positive C19 tests were invited to participate in this longitudinal study after providing consent. Pts completed the EQ-5D-5L and the 13 symptom severity and 6 interference items of the core MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) plus 14 COVID-specific symptom items generated from literature and expert review. Items were measured on a 0-10 scale, 0 = none to 10 = worst imaginable symptom or interference. Demographic and disease information was collected. Psychometric procedures determined validity and reliability of the MDASI-COVID. Results: 600 pts enrolled, mean age 56.5y (range 20 to 91y). 59% female, 80% white. 78% solid tumors, 19% heme cancers. 12.5% required hospitalization for C19. Median number of days between positive C19 test and PRO completion was 17 days. Mean overall health rating on EQ-5D-5L was 78.3 (SD 19.6), best being 100. Highest mean (M) severity symptoms on the MDASI-COVID were fatigue (M 3.45, SD 2.17), drowsiness (M 2.50, SD 2.89), sleep disturbance (M 2.44, SD 2.99), malaise (M 2.37, SD 3.05), and distress (M 2.27, SD 2.90). Most severe (≥ 7) symptoms) reported were fatigue (21.3% of pts), change in taste (14.8%), change in smell (14.4%), malaise (14.3%), sleep disturbance (14.3%), and drowsiness (14%). Internal consistency (Cronbach α) of the 27 symptom items was 0.957, of the 6 interference items was 0.937. Mean severity of the 27 symptom items was significantly correlated with overall EQ-5D-5L health rating (correlation = -0.45, P &lt; 0.0005), demonstrating concurrent validity. Mean symptom severity and interference showed known-group validity between patients who required C19 hospitalization (symptom M 2.32, SD 2.09;interference M 3.29, SD 3.02) and those who did not (symptom M 1.69, SD 1.85;interference M 2.20, SD 2.64) (symptom P 0.007;interference P 0.004). Conclusions: We have validated a novel PRO, the MDASI-COVID, to quantify the combined symptom burden in patients with cancer and COVID-19. This measure allows longitudinal evaluation of COVID-19 on cancer symptom burden and provide clinicians with an accurate tool for ongoing symptom assessment and management. Longitudinal analysis on long-term symptoms related to COVID-19 and cancer are ongoing.","Williams, L. A.; Whisenant, M.; Mendoza, T. R.; Malveaux, D.; Griffin, D.; Ponce, D.; Cleeland, C.

This study aimed to examine health anxiety (HA) in the healthcare workers (HCWs) of COVID-19 patients from March to May 2020. Material and Methods: The statistical population of this descriptive study consisted of all 101 HCWs of COVID-19 patients at Ali ibn-Abi Talib Hospital in the Rafsanjan County, who were invited to help with this survey using the census sampling method. They completed the Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI). The data were analyzed using ANOVA and the independent t-test. Results: A total of 39 (38.6%) of the participants witnessed the death of COVID-19 patients. Out of the 101 staff, 72.3% suffered from mild anxiety, 24.8% from moderate anxiety, and 3% from health anxiety. The mean score of health anxiety was significantly higher in male participants (p= 0.040) and also in those who witnessed the death of COVID-19 patients (p= 0.036). There was a significant negative correlation between health anxiety and work experience (p=0.032) so that health anxiety was higher in employees with less experience (p= 0.033). Conclusion: The level of anxiety and health anxiety in staff dealing with COVID-19 patients is high. Due to negative effects of anxiety on effectiveness of employee performance, it is necessary to make necessary interventions to improve their mental state. © The Author(s) 2021;All rights reserved.

Here, we investigated differences in RT-qPCR Ct values across Qatar national cohorts of primary infections, reinfections, BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) breakthrough infections, and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) breakthrough infections. Through matched-cohort analyses of the randomly diagnosed infections, the mean Ct value was higher in all cohorts of breakthrough infections compared to the cohort of primary infections in unvaccinated individuals. The Ct value was 1.3 (95% CI: 0.9-1.8) cycles higher for BNT162b2 breakthrough infections, 3.2 (95% CI: 1.8-4.5) cycles higher for mRNA-1273 breakthrough infections, and 4.0 (95% CI: 3.4-4.6) cycles higher for reinfections in unvaccinated individuals. Assuming a linear relationship between viral load and infectiousness, these differences imply that breakthrough infections are at least 50% less infectious than primary infections in unvaccinated individuals.

Using panel data and pooled Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), it is seen that the increase in COVID-19 verified cases has led to adverse reactions by the stock market. This can be determined through related stock market returns data from March 3rd, 2020 to December 9th, 2020, which shows that, during this period, stock market returns declined as numbers of registered cases grew. In addition, further observation reveals that stock markets took a more dynamic stance towards the rise in confirmed non-fatal cases as opposed to that of virus-related fatalities. Furthermore, it is noticed that when the degree of restriction of lockdown increases, the impact of Brent crude oil price return on Saudi stock market return decreases. Thus, the suggestion is that investors should not use Brent oil return as an indicator of Saudi stock return during a complete lockdown. Moreover, the rise of lockdown restrictions and the number of confirmed cases leads to more fluctuation in the Saudi stock market return.

The COVID-19 epidemic has negatively affected their health and especially their sleep quality. This study aimed to compare the quality of sleep and the factors affecting it among Iranian nurses before and at the same time with the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: This analytical cross-sectional study was performed on 175 frontline nurses in the fight against COVID-19 in 2020. Samples were collected using convenience sampling from two selected military and referral hospitals of COVID-19 in Tehran, Iran. Data were collected using a demographic information form and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Questionnaire. Data were analyzed using SPSS 16 software and one-sample t-test, independent t-test, and one-way analysis of variance. Results: The majority of the samples were male (64%), under 30 years old (41.4%), and with less than 10 years of clinical experience (58.9%). 96% of nurses had poor sleep quality. Comparison of the results of nurses' sleep quality with the same population before the time of the Covid-19 epidemic showed a statistically significant difference (P <0.05). There was a significant difference between gender, marriage, and interest in the organization with poor sleep status (P <0.05). Conclusion: According to the results, nurses did not have good sleep quality.

A prominent hypothesis, mostly based on preclinical studies, is that individual differences in the gut microbiome composition and drug-induced dysbiosis may be associated with vulnerability to psychiatric disorders including substance use disorder. However, most studies used small sample size, ignored individual differences, or used animal models with limited relevance to addiction. Here, we test the hypothesis that pre-existing microbiome composition and drug-induced changes in microbiome composition can predict addiction-like behaviors using an advanced animal model of extended access to cocaine self-administration in a large cohort of heterogenous stock (HS) rats. Adult male and female HS rats were allowed to self-administer cocaine under short (2h/day) and long access (6h/day) for ~7 weeks under various schedule of reinforcement to identify individuals that are resistant or vulnerable to addiction-like behaviors and fecal samples were collected before the first session and after the last session to assess differences in the microbiome composition. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) identified sex-dependent and sex-independent differences at the phylum, order, and species level that are differentially abundant in resistant vs. vulnerable individuals, including high level of actinobacteria both before the first exposure to cocaine and after 7 weeks of cocaine self-administration in resistant animals. Predictions of functional gene content using PICRUSt revealed differential regulation of short-chain fatty acid processing in the vulnerable group after self-administration. These results identify microbiome constituents as well as metabolic pathways that are associated with resistance or vulnerability to addiction-like behaviors in rats. Identification of microbes and tangential metabolic pathways involved in cocaine resilience/vulnerability may represent an innovative strategy for the development of novel biomarkers and medication for the treatment of cocaine use disorder.","Simpson, S.; de Guglielmo, G.; Brennan, M.; Maturin, L.; Peters, G.; Jia, H.; Wellmeyer, E.; Andrews, S.; Woods, L.

Approximately 48% (967/2038) had recovered from COVID-19 within 1-3 months (short-term recovered), 34.2% (375/2038) had recovered from COVID-19 >3 months ago (long recovered), and 18.4% (375) were recovered within the last one month (recently recovered). Nearly 38% (770/2038) had a history of hospitalization for COVID-19. Of them, 34.28% (264/770) required oxygen therapy during the hospital stay. Most patients were discharged within 5-10 days of hospital stay (54%, 415/770). Only 5.58% (43/770) required a stay of more than 20 days. Seventy-five percent (575/770) of the hospitalized patients received steroid therapy. Of those who received steroid therapy, 56.5% (325/575) had not required oxygen therapy. Forty percent (233/575) of patients received steroid therapy for two weeks, 24% (138/575) for one week, 33.73% received steroids only during the hospital stay, and 1.73% were still on steroid therapy during the survey. Most importantly, of the 2038 respondents, 41.8% (851/2038) still had persistent symptoms related to COVID-19. Most common symptom was fatigue (64.15%), followed by body pain (31%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (25%) (Figure). Six percent (49/851) of them required hospitalization for post-COVID-19 symptoms. Forty-six percent (449/967) in the short term recovered group (1-3 months), 40.1% (279/696) in the long-recovered group, and 32.8% (123/375) in the recently recovered group had persistent symptoms related to COVID-19 (P=0.001). Forty-eight percent (374/770) of the hospitalized patients developed post-COVID-19 symptoms, while only 37.6% (477/1268) developed post-COVID-19 symptoms among the non-hospitalized patients (P<0.001). Fifty-three percent (303/575) of those who received steroids developed post-COVID-19 symptoms, while only 36.41% (71/195) of those who did not receive steroids developed post-COVID-19 symptoms (P<0.001). 49% (159/325) of patients who received steroids despite being not requiring oxygen developed post-COVID-19 symptoms compared to only 37.5% (543/1449) who did not receive steroids and were not on oxygen therapy (P<0.001). Nearly 40% (336/851) of respondents felt that post-COVID-19 symptoms are not being appropriately treated or taken care of seriously. Conclusions: Post-COVID-19 symptoms are common in patients who recovered from COVID-19. These symptoms are more often noted in patients who received steroid therapy. Post-COVID-19 symptomatology is present in a significant number of patients and requires to be addressed seriously.","Rao, V. G.; Gella, V.; Radhakrishnan, M.; Kumar, J.

The majority of evidence relates to pandemic 2009 A/H1N1 influenza. The objective of this study was to describe the characteristics and outcomes of pregnant women hospitalised with seasonal influenza. Methods This national, prospective, observational cohort study used the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) to identify all pregnant women admitted to hospital between 01/11/2016 and 31/10/2018 with laboratory confirmed influenza together with a comparison group of pregnant women. Baseline characteristics, immunisation status, maternal and perinatal outcomes were compared. Results There were 405 women admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed influenza in pregnancy: 2.7 per 10,000 maternities. Compared to 694 comparison women, women with influenza were less likely to be professionally employed (aOR 0.59, 95%CI 0.39-0.89) or immunised in the relevant season (aOR 0.59, 0.39-0.89) and more likely to have asthma (aOR 2.42, 1.30-4.49) or have had a previous pregnancy complication (aOR 2.47, 1.33-4.61). They were more likely to be admitted to intensive care (aOR 21.3, 2.78-163.1) and to have a caesarean birth (aOR 1.42, 1.02-1.98). Their babies were more likely to be admitted to neonatal intensive care (aOR 1.86, 1.01-3.42). Conclusions Immunisation reduces the risk of hospitalisation with influenza in pregnancy which is associated with increased risk of morbidity for both the mother and baby. There is a continued need to increase awareness of safety and effectiveness of immunisation in pregnancy and provision within antenatal care settings, especially for high risk groups.","Vousden, N.; Bunch, K.; Knight, M.; Group, UKOSS Influenza Co-Investigators",,331,9

(99m)Tc-(CO)₃ His-ann A5 was injected 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours posttreatment, and micro-single-photon emission computed tomography was performed. Immunostaining of caspase-3 (apoptosis), survivin (antiapoptosis), and LC3-II (autophagy marker) was also performed. Different dynamics of (99m)Tc-(CO)₃ His-ann A5 uptake were observed in this colorectal cancer xenograft model, in response to a single dose of three different chemotherapeutics (5-FU, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin). Bevacizumab-treated mice showed no increased uptake of the radiotracer, and a peak of (99m)Tc-(CO)₃ His-ann A5 uptake in panitumumab-treated mice was observed 24 hours posttreatment, as confirmed by caspase-3 immunostaining. For irinotecan-, oxaliplatin-, and bevacizumab-treated tumors, a significant correlation was established between the radiotracer uptake and caspase-3 immunostaining (r = .8, p < .05; r = .9, p < .001; r = .9, p < .001, respectively). For 5-FU- and panitumumab-treated mice, the correlation coefficients were r = .7 (p = .18) and r = .7 (p = .19), respectively.

Significantly more patients receiving lumiracoxib than placebo were responders according to ACR20 criteria at week 13 (41.1 and 42.7% for lumiracoxib 200 and 400 mg o.d., respectively; 32.4% for placebo; both p < 0.05). The proportion responding to naproxen (39.1%) was not significantly different from placebo.

A prospective multicenter observational study was conducted using a preestablished sentinel surveillance system in Guangzhou, China during 2009. In this study, the clinical presentations of patients with either acute respiratory infection or community-acquired pneumonia were recorded, and nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected for detection of respiratory virus strains using cell cultures or real-time reverse transcription/real-time polymerase chain reaction. Comparisons of the clinical features between A(H1N1)pdm09- and seasonal influenza viruses-infected patients were conducted accordingly. Of the 1,498 patients examined, 265 tested positive for A(H1N1)pdm09, 286 were positive for seasonal influenza A viruses, and 137 for influenza B viruses. The predominant virus was influenza B before the emergence of A(H1N1)pdm09 (epidemiological week [EW] 1-EW 21); then, predominantly non-A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza A and, later, A(H1N1)pdm09, which peaked in EW 46. Compared with the common seasonal influenza-infected patients, A(H1N1)pdm09-infected patients were younger, and had a higher proportion of these patients reported prior contact with infected individuals (P < 0.001, by χ(2) test). However, few significant differences were observed in clinical symptoms and severity among any of the infections caused by the different influenza A strains. Our hospital-based network served as a useful source of information during A(H1N1)pdm09 monitoring. Viral distribution in Guangzhou was characterized by a sharp rise in A(H1N1)pdm09-infected patients in September 2009.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the leading causes of discrepancies between imaging studies [contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and contrast enhanced computer tomography (CECT)] diagnosis and histology in patients presenting to a tertiary referral center with previously detected pancreatic masses by standard abdominal ultrasound. METHODS. We performed a prospective longitudinal observational study on 76 patients with pancreatic masses: 57 (75%) patients with solid pancreatic tumors and 19 (25%) patients with cystic and mixed pancreatic masses. For each tumor the CEUS and CECT features were analyzed and compared with the final histological diagnosis. RESULTS. Testing the performance of CEUS and CECT in evaluating the benign or malignant etiology of pancreatic masses, we obtained a probability of 82% for CEUS and of 83% for CECT, for a randomly selected individual from the pancreatic tumor group to have an imaging result indicating suspicion for malignancy. We obtained discordances with the histopathological diagnosis in 25 (32.89%) patients for CEUS and in 23 (30.26%) patients for CECT. In multiple regression analysis, two variables independently influenced the discordance between the two imaging methods and histological conclusion: enhancement pattern and tumor nature (solid vs. cystic). CONCLUSIONS.CEUS and CECT showed a good diagnostic performance in differentiating benign from malignant pancreatic tumors. Enhancement pattern and tumor nature (solid vs. cystic) are independent confounders between imaging and histological diagnosis.","Vasile, Tudor Andrei; Feier, Diana; Socaciu, Mihai; Anton, Ofelia Maria; Seicean, Andrada; Iancu, Cornel; Zaharie, Toader; Badea, Radu",Journal of gastrointestinal and liver diseases : JGLD,331,19

Iridoviruses are emerging pathogens that cause global amphibian epizootics, including tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) die-offs throughout western North America. To explain phylogeographical relationships and potential causes for emergence of western North American salamander iridovirus strains, we sequenced major capsid protein and DNA methyltransferase genes, as well as two noncoding regions from 18 geographically widespread isolates. Phylogenetic analyses of sequence data from the capsid protein gene showed shallow genetic divergence (< 1%) among salamander iridovirus strains and monophyly relative to available fish, reptile, and other amphibian iridovirus strains from the genus Ranavirus, suggesting a single introduction and radiation. Analysis of capsid protein sequences also provided support for a closer relationship of tiger salamander virus strains to those isolated from sport fish (e.g. rainbow trout) than other amphibian isolates. Despite monophyly based on capsid protein sequences, there was low genetic divergence among all strains (< 1.1%) based on a supergene analysis of the capsid protein and the two noncoding regions. These analyses also showed polyphyly of strains from Arizona and Colorado, suggesting recent spread. Nested clade analyses indicated both range expansion and long-distance colonization in clades containing virus strains isolated from bait salamanders and the Indiana University axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) colony. Human enhancement of viral movement is a mechanism consistent with these results. These findings suggest North American salamander ranaviruses cause emerging disease, as evidenced by apparent recent spread over a broad geographical area.","Jancovich, J K; Davidson, E W; Parameswaran, N; Mao, J; Chinchar, V G; Collins, J P; Jacobs, B L; Storfer, A",Molecular ecology,331,28

Expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II in the spinal cords of mice infected with TMEV was found predominantly on macrophages in demyelinating lesions. The distribution of I-As staining overlapped that of the macrophage marker sialoadhesin in frozen sections and coincided with that of another macrophage/microglial cell marker, F4/80, by flow cytometry. In contrast, astrocytes, identified by staining with glial fibrillary acidic protein, rarely expressed detectable MHC class II, although fibrillary gliosis associated with the CNS damage was clearly seen. The costimulatory molecules B7-1 and B7-2 were expressed on the surface of most MHC class II-positive cells in the CNS, at levels exceeding those found in the spleens of the infected mice. Immunohistochemistry revealed that B7-1 and B7-2 colocalized on large F4/80(+) macrophages/microglia in the spinal cord lesions. In contrast, CD4(+) T cells in the lesions expressed mainly B7-2, which was found primarily on blastoid CD4(+) T cells located toward the periphery of the lesions. Most interestingly, plastic-adherent cells freshly isolated from the spinal cords of TMEV-infected mice were able to process and present TMEV and horse myoglobin to antigen-specific T-cell lines. Furthermore, these cells were able to activate a TMEV epitope-specific T-cell line in the absence of added antigen, providing conclusive evidence for the endogenous processing and presentation of virus epitopes within the CNS of persistently infected SJL/J mice.","Pope, J G; Vanderlugt, C L; Rahbe, S M; Lipton, H L; Miller, S D",Journal of virology,331,33

The MHV Wb1 isolate is a deletion mutant that lacks a functional ns2 gene and the transcriptional signals required for the synthesis of an ns2 mRNA. However, there are no obviously significant differences in the growth of the MHV Wb1 and MHV Wb3 isolates in continuous cell lines or in the synthesis of viral mRNAs or proteins in infected cells.

However, administration of corticosteroid to Mycoplasma pneumoniae patients suspected of having SARS may unnecessarily increase the risk of opportunistic infection. We compared the clinical course of 13 SARS patients and 6 patients with mycoplasma pneumonia treated during the outbreak of SARS in Taiwan. METHODS Patients admitted due to suspicion of SARS with a subsequent diagnosis of SARS or Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia were included. RESULTS The initial clinical manifestations were similar in patients with SARS and those with M. pneumoniae infection. However, SARS patients had more severe lymphopenia (p = 0.013) and anemia (p = 0.007), and more persistent pulmonary infiltrates (p = 0.023). Respiratory failure developed in 15.4% of the SARS patients and in none of the M. pneumoniae patients. Recovery from thrombocytopenia was associated with defervescence in 12 SARS patients and radiographic improvement in 6 in the following 5 days. In those with unsatisfactory resolution of the pulmonary infiltrates, corticosteroid therapy was associated with rapid radiographic improvement. CONCLUSIONS Because of similar initial presentations, differentiating SARS from M. pneumoniae pneumonia is very difficult based on symptomatology. In this series, lymphopenia and anemia were more severe in SARS than in M. pneumoniae infection, and SARS patients had more persistent and more new pulmonary infiltrates after hospitalization.","Wang, Jann-Yuan; Lee, Chih-Hsin; Cheng, Shih-Lung; Chang, Hou-Tai; Hsu, Yeong-Long; Wang, Hao-Chien; Chu, Shu-Hsun",Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,331,24

The CASB patients were assessed before and after graft insertion. RESULTS The average APT value was 18.5 mm for the pre-operative knees and it fell to 8.9 mm after AM bundle reconstruction. However, when the PL bundle was inserted in the first place, the average APT value was 13.1 mm only. The average values recorded after the DB and CASB reconstructions were 6.1 mm and 9.1 mm, respectively. The average IR range of motion in the pre-operative joints was 18.6 degrees. After AM bundle reconstruction it was 13.9 degrees and after PL bundle repair it was 15.3 degrees. In DB reconstruction the average IR value achieved 10.4 degrees, and in CASB repair surgery it was 13.7 degrees. The average ER range of motion in the pre-operative joints was 17.8 degrees. After AM bundle reconstruction it was 14.5 degrees and after PL bundle repair it was 14.9 degrees. In DB reconstruction the average ER value achieved 11.4 degrees, and in CASB repair surgery it was 14.5 degrees. DISCUSSION Rotational stability of the knee after ACL reconstruction is one of the most important factors in restoring physiological kinematics of the joint after ACL injury. Since there are not many studies comparing knee rotational stability after CASB with that after DB reconstructions, the results presented here may contribute to selecting the optimal method of ACL reconstruction. CONCLUSIONS The results show that, in ACL reconstruction, the DB technique provides better stability to the knee, in both APT and rotation, than the CASB method. The latter has the same effect on knee stability as the presence of the AM bundle alone. When the PL bundle is added, knee stability, in both APT and internal/external rotation, is increased in comparison with central single-bundle ACL repair. Key words:anterior cruciate ligament, navigation, central anatomical single-bundle reconstruction, double-bundle reconstruction.","Komzák, M; Hart, R; Smíd, P; Puskeiler, M",Acta chirurgiae orthopaedicae et traumatologiae Cechoslovaca,331,1

Conditions such as HIV infection or treatment with immunosuppressors (in cancer or autoimmune diseases) are not among the bad prognosis factors for development of distress. To date, there have been no reported case fatalities in children, probably due to their more immature immune system. Our conclusions follow: (1) The milder form of SARS in children and the apparent protective factor that immunosupression represent rules out a significant viral cytopathic effect (they would be the most affected). (2) The evidence for immune implication in distress strongly supports immunomodulators for therapy: phosphodiesterase inhibitors (due to their down-modulating activity on proinflammatory cytokines); inhaled corticoids (aimed at producing a local immunomodulation); teophylline or nedocromil sodium (which prevents inflammatory cell recruitment into the airway wall). (3) An early immunomodulatory therapy, based on the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and clinical parameters to evaluate the respiratory function such as arterial oxygen saturation, could prevent the occurrence of distress. (4) Vaccine design should consider the immune origin of distress. (5) Physicians should be aware of mildly symptomatic patients (children, immuno-compromised hosts) to avoid transmission to immunocompetent adults.","Bermejo, Jesus F; Muñoz-Fernandez, M Angeles",Viral immunology,331,1

This present study was aimed to examine the trend, the disease categories treated and the outcomes of HMV use in Hong Kong. In the year 2002, all adult respiratory units in Hong Kong were invited to report to a multicentre retrospective survey of HMV use. A total of 249 patients (156 males, mean age 62.7 +/- 13.8 yrs) were treated since 1980, with 197 (79%) continuing with HMV at the time of the survey. Cumulative number of HMV grew as a cubic function of time since 1980. Currently, there are 2.9 users per 100,000 population. The predominant mode of HMV was noninvasive ventilation by bilevel pressure support ventilators (n=236). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease accounted for 48.6% of all cases. The overall 3-yr HMV continuation rate was 66.2%. Death was the main reason for discontinuation. A rapidly rising trend of home mechanical ventilation use is observed in Hong Kong. In contrast to other series, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was the major group treated and bilevel pressure support ventilation was the predominant mode chosen. Most patients tolerate home mechanical ventilation reasonably well, with approximately two-thirds continuing with its use at 36 months.","Chu, C M; Yu, W C; Tam, C M; Lam, C W; Hui, D S C; Lai, C K W",The European respiratory journal,331,26

METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 53 children who were confirmed with asymptomatic or subclinical COVID-19, including epidemiological history, clinical typing, co-infection, time to clearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid in nasopharyngeal swabs, laboratory examination results, length of hospital stay, and treatment outcome. RESULTS The children with asymptomatic or subclinical COVID-19 accounted for 30.5% (53/174) in children with COVID-19 hospitalized in the COVID-19 ward of Wuhan Children's Hospital. All cases occurred with familial aggregation. Among the 53 children, 35 (66%) had asymptomatic infection and 18 (34%) had subclinical infection. Mycoplasma infection was found in 17 children (32%). For the 53 children, the mean time to clearance of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in nasopharyngeal swabs was 9±4 days. Most laboratory markers were maintained within the normal range. The mean hospital stay was 11±4 days. Lung CT of 18 children with subclinical COVID-19 showed ground-glass opacities, linear opacities, and patchy opacities, with relatively limited lesions. CONCLUSIONS There is a high proportion of children with asymptomatic or subclinical COVID-19 among the children with COVID-19 hospitalized in the COVID-19 ward. The transmission risk of asymptomatic or subclinical COVID-19 should be taken seriously.","Liu, You-Jing; Chen, Peng; Liu, Zhi-Sheng; Li, Ying; DU, Hui; Xu, Jia-Li",Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,331,1

Influence of these viral infections on body weight, survival, and prevalences of spontaneous tumors in the F344/NCr rats of 28 diet control groups at five different laboratories were evaluated. Tumor prevalences evaluated in this investigation included the following: leukemia and tumors of the anterior pituitary, lungs, salivary glands and Harderian glands in both sexes; adrenal pheochromocytomas in male rats; and mammary tumors in female rats. SV and PVM but not RCV/SDAV infections were associated with significant (P less than 0.05) decreases in body weights of male and female rats. Male rat groups with PVM infection had a lower prevalence of leukemia and male rat groups with RCV/SDAV infection had a higher prevalence of anterior pituitary tumors than the corresponding uninfected groups. Female rat groups with SV infection had greater survival and a higher prevalence of lung tumors than groups without SV infection. However, none of the tumor prevalence and survival differences were statistically significant when interlaboratory variability and time-related effects were taken into account.","Rao, G N; Haseman, J K; Edmondson, J",Laboratory animal science,331,22

In Hong Kong, we converted a conventional operating theater into a negative-pressure operating theater that has been in service for more than a year. In this article, we introduce its ventilation design and evaluate the airflow performance in relation to different combinations of medical lamp configurations and modes of launching infectious particles into the room air. METHODS We used a computational fluid dynamics technique for the numerical analysis. RESULTS Our analyses showed that the airflow performance in the negative-pressure operating theater was satisfactory and comparable to the original positive-pressure design. The airflow pattern effectively controlled the dispersion of infectious particles. Our calculations demonstrated that the airflow contained the dispersion of infectious particles released from the patient sufficiently to protect the surgical team, and vice versa. CONCLUSIONS Computational fluid dynamics can be used to assess airflow in a negative-pressure operating room and model the dispersion of infectious particles from the patient.","Chow, Tin-tai; Kwan, Anne; Lin, Zhang; Bai, Wei",Anesthesia and analgesia,331,20

OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical and analytical features of a coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) infected cohort with SCI to enable accurate diagnosis and to outline prevention measures. SETTING: This study was conducted at the National Hospital for Paraplegics (Toledo, Spain). METHODS: A cohort analysis of seven patients with SCI infected by Covid-19 was performed. Diagnosis was confirmed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasal exudate or sputum samples. Clinical, analytical, and radiographic findings were registered. RESULTS: RT-PCR detected COVID-19 infection in all patients, affecting males and people with a cervical level of injury more often (five out of seven). The average delay for diagnostic confirmation was 4 days (interquartile range, 1-10). Fever was the most frequent symptom (six out of seven). The second most common symptom was asthenia (four out of seven), followed by dyspnea, cough, and expectoration (three out of seven for each symptom). The Modified Early Warning System score for Covid-19 severity rating was classified as severe in five out of seven cases. All but one patient showed radiological alterations evident in chest X-rays at the time of diagnosis. All patients recovered gradually. CONCLUSION: Our patients with SCI and Covid-19 infection exhibited fewer symptoms than the general population. Furthermore, they presented similar or greater clinical severity. The clinical evolution was not as pronounced as had been expected. This study recommends close supervision of the SCI population to detect early compatible signs and symptoms of Covid-19 infection.","Rodríguez-Cola, Miguel; Jiménez-Velasco, Irena; Gutiérrez-Henares, Francisco; López-Dolado, Elisa; Gambarrutta-Malfatti, Claudia; Vargas-Baquero, Eduardo; Gil-Agudo, Ángel",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,331,6

Despite the fact that SARS-CoV-2 has slower evolutionary rate than other coronaviruses, different mutational hotspots have been identified along the SARS-CoV-2 genome. METHODS: We performed whole-genome high throughput sequencing on isolates from 50 Egyptian patients to see if the variation in clinical symptoms was related to mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Then, we investigated the relationship between the observed mutations and the clinical characteristics of the patients. RESULTS: Among the 36 most common mutations, we found two frameshift deletions linked to an increased risk of shortness of breath, a V6 deletion in the spike glycoprotein's signal peptide region linked to an increased risk of fever, longer fever duration and nasal congestion, and L3606-nsp6 deletion linked to a higher prevalence of cough and conjunctival congestion. S5398L nsp13-helicase was linked to an increased risk of fever duration and progression. The most common mutations (241, 3037, 14,408, and 23,403) were not linked to clinical variability. However, the E3909G-nsp7 variant was more common in children (2-13 years old) and was associated with a shorter duration of symptoms. The duration of fever was significantly reduced with E1363D-nsp3 and E3073A-nsp4. CONCLUSIONS: The most common mutations, D614G/spike-glycoprotein and P4715L/RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase, were linked to transmissibility regardless of symptom variability. E3909G-nsp7 could explain why children recover so quickly. Nsp6-L3606fs, spike-glycoprotein-V6fs, and nsp13-S5398L variants may be linked to clinical symptom worsening. These variations related to host-virus interactions might open new therapeutic avenues for symptom relief and disease containment.","Zekri, Abdel-Rahman N; Mohanad, Marwa; Hafez, Mohammed M; Soliman, Hany K; Hassan, Zainab K; Abouelhoda, Mohamed; Amer, Khaled E; Seadawy, Mohamed G; Ahmed, Ola S",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Basis Dis,331,16

More importantly, elevated expression of regulatory molecules, such as CD244 and programmed death-1 (PD-1), on NK cells and T cells, as well as decreased serum cytotoxic effector molecules including perforin and granzyme A, were detected in patients with COVID-19. The serum IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-&#945; were significantly increased in severe patients. Moreover, the CD3-CD56dimCD16- cells were screened out as an influential factor in severe cases by LASSO logistic regression. Conclusions: The functional exhaustion and other subset alteration of NK and T cells may contribute to the progression and improve the prognosis of COVID-19. Surveillance of lymphocyte subsets may in the future enable early screening for signs of critical illness and understanding the pathogenesis of this disease.","Li, Mingyue; Guo, Weina; Dong, Yalan; Wang, Xiaobei; Dai, Die; Liu, Xingxing; Wu, Yiquan; Li, Mengmeng; Zhang, Wenjing; Zhou, Haifeng; Zhang, Zili; Lin, Lan; Kang, Zhenyu; Yu, Ting; Tian, Chunxia; Qin, Renjie; Gui, Yang; Jiang, Feng; Fan, Heng; Heissmeyer, Vigo; Sarapultsev, Alexey; Wang, Lin; Luo, Shanshan; Hu, Desheng",Front Immunol,331,2

However, little is known about this practice, including potential motivating factors. Objective: To examine individual reasons for accessing medication abortion through an online telemedicine service as well as associations between state- and county-level factors and the rate of requests. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cross-sectional study examined all requests for self-managed medication abortion through an online consultation form available from Aid Access, a telemedicine service in the US, between March 20, 2018, and March 20, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Individual-level reasons for accessing the telemedicine service were examined as well as the rate of requests per 100â¯000 women of reproductive age by state. Zip code data provided by individuals making requests were used to examine county-level factors hypothesized to be associated with increased demand for self-managed abortion: distance to a clinic (calculated using location data for US abortion clinics) and the population proportion identifying as a member of a racial/ethnic minority group, living below the federal poverty level, and having broadband internet access (calculated using census data). Results: During the 2-year study period, 57â¯506 individuals in 2458 counties in 50 states requested self-managed medication abortion; 52.1% were aged 20 to 29 years (mean [SD] age, 25.9 [6.7] years), 50.0% had children, and 99.9% were 10 weeks' pregnant or less. The most common reasons cited by individuals making requests were the inability to afford in-clinic care (73.5%), privacy (49.3%), and clinic distance (40.4%). States with the highest rate of requests were Louisiana (202.7 per 100â¯000 women) and Mississippi (199.9 per 100â¯000 women). At the county level, an increase of 1 SD (47 miles) in distance to the nearest clinic was significantly associated with a 41% increase in requests (incidence rate ratio, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.31-1.51; P < .001), and a 10% increase in the population living below the federal poverty level was significantly associated with a 20% increase in requests (incidence rate ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.13-1.28; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study, clinic access barriers were the most commonly cited reason for requesting self-managed medication abortion using an online telemedicine service. At the county level, distance to an abortion clinic and living below the federal poverty level were associated with a higher rate of requests. State and federal legislation could address these access barriers.","Aiken, Abigail R A; Starling, Jennifer E; Gomperts, Rebecca",JAMA Netw Open,331,26

The registration characteristics of ethical status, number of recruits, total time, number of groups, intervention, study endpoint type, withdrawal, randomized controlled trial (RCT), stage, registration type, provinces distribution and patients' condition were summarized. IBM SPSS 22.0 software was used to analyze the above characteristics. Results: A total of 400 registered clinical studies were collected. Among them, 59 studies were not ethically approved, 15 studies were withdrawn, and stages of 303 studies were unclear. The differences of the three registration characteristics on the two official websites were statistically significant (all P&lt;0.05). Fourteen studies recruited more than 1 000 people, the total time of 189 studies exceeded 6 months, and the number of groups in 22 studies exceeded 4 groups. There was no significant difference in the three registration characteristics on the two official websites. Only 15 studies were industry-sponsored trial. Most registered clinical studies were distributed in Hubei Province. Conclusion: The awareness of Chinese investigator initiating trial registration has increased.

DESIGN: descriptive analysis of temporal variations of total excess deaths and COVID-19 deaths in the phase 1 and phase 2 of the epidemic in Italy. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 12 Northern cities and 20 Central-Southern cities from December 2019 to June 2020: daily mortality from the National Surveillance System of Daily Mortality (SiSMG) and COVID-19 deaths from the integrated COVID-19 surveillance system. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: total mortality excess and COVID-19 deaths, defined as deaths in microbiologically confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2, by gender and age groups. RESULTS: the largest excess mortality was observed in the North and during the first phase of the epidemic. The portion of excess mortality explained by COVID-19 decreases with age, decreasing to 51% among the very old (>=85 years). In phase 2 (until June 2020), the impact was more contained and totally attributable to COVID-19 deaths and this suggests an effectiveness of social distancing measures.

For success, the chosen strategy would need considerable public support. So here we demonstrate how support, or otherwise, could have been predicted using our freely available Planticipate app. It self improves by sending its users' judgements to the cloud, where learning routines formulate regression- and neural network-based relationships between thirteen, key, plan-evaluation criteria and overall plan desirability. Hence whenever any set of plans are scored on the criteria, these relationships generate forecasts of plan desirability according to a number of demographic groups of past users. Our app predicted that many community groups will regard the ‘do-Nothing’ option as statistically significantly inferior to the other two plans, and it also made several less-than-statistically-significant forecasts which were extremely thought provoking. Using innovative face charts to better interpret complicated, thirteen-dimensional data, Planticipate also suggested probable reasons for such forecasts. These included an apparent fixation upon only permissiveness and productivity by people living in North America and relative pragmatism amongst females. Such revelations immediately suggested possible modifications for making different plans more acceptable to certain community groups. Given that in reality several of these modifications were only implemented later on during the pandemic, an early application of our app would almost certainly have prompted faster, more creative and more empathetic urban management.","Wyatt, Ray",Journal of Urban Management,331,16

This paper examines effectiveness of different vaccination strategies. We investigate the effects of two key elements in mass vaccination, which are allocations and timing of first and second doses and types of vaccines, on the spread of COVID-19. Amid limited supply of approved vaccines and constrained medical resources, the choice of a vaccination strategy is fundamentally an economic problem. We employ standard time-series and panel data models commonly used in economic research with real world data to estimate the effects of progress in vaccination and types of vaccines on health outcomes. Potential confounders such as government responses and people's behavioral changes are also taken into account. Our findings suggest that the share of people vaccinated with at least one dose is significantly negatively associated with new infections and deaths. Conditioning on first dose progress, full vaccination offers no further reductions in new cases and deaths. For vaccines from China, however, we find weaker effects of vaccination progress on health outcomes. Our results support the extending interval between first and second dose policy adopted by Canada and the UK among others for mRNA-based vaccines. As vaccination progressed, people's mobility increased and it offset the direct effects of vaccination. Therefore, public health measures are still important to contain the transmission by refraining people from being more mobile after vaccinated.","Kim, Dongwoo; Lee, Young Jun",,331,26

Shortage of Intensive care unit (ICU) beds led clinicians to deliver NIV also outside intensive care units (ICUs). Data about the use of NIV in COVID-19 is limited. OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 treated with NIV outside the ICUs. To investigate the factors associated with NIV failure (need for intubation or death). METHODS: In this prospective single day observational study, we enrolled adult COVID-19 patients, treated with NIV outside the ICU from thirty-one hospitals in Lombardy, Italy. RESULTS: We collected data on demographic, clinical characteristics, ventilatory management and patients' outcome. Of 8753 COVID-19 patients present in the hospitals on the study day, 909 (10%) were receiving NIV outside the ICU. 778/909 (85%) patients were treated with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), delivered by helmet in 617 (68%). NIV failed in 300 patients (37.6%), while 498 (62.4%) were discharged alive without intubation. Overall mortality was 25%. NIV failure occurred in 152/284 (53%) patients with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 150 mmHg. Higher C-reactive protein, lower PaO2/FiO2, and platelet counts were independently associated with increased risk of NIV failure. CONCLUSIONS: The use of NIV outside the ICUs, in COVID-19 was common, with a predominant use of helmet CPAP, with a rate of success greater than 60% and close to 75% in full treatment patients. C-reactive protein, PaO2/FiO2, platelet counts were independently associated with increased risk of NIV failure.

In this work, we introduce SMedBERT, a medical PLM trained on large-scale medical corpora, incorporating deep structured semantic knowledge from neighbors of linked-entity.In SMedBERT, the mention-neighbor hybrid attention is proposed to learn heterogeneous-entity information, which infuses the semantic representations of entity types into the homogeneous neighboring entity structure. Apart from knowledge integration as external features, we propose to employ the neighbors of linked-entities in the knowledge graph as additional global contexts of text mentions, allowing them to communicate via shared neighbors, thus enrich their semantic representations. Experiments demonstrate that SMedBERT significantly outperforms strong baselines in various knowledge-intensive Chinese medical tasks. It also improves the performance of other tasks such as question answering, question matching and natural language inference.","Zhang, Taolin; Cai, Zerui; Wang, Chengyu; Qiu, Minghui; Yang, Bite; He, Xiaofeng",,331,1

We investigated the impact of social distancing practiced during the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic on the incidence of selected VPDs in South Korea. METHODS: National surveillance data on monthly incidence of hepatitis A, hepatitis B, varicella, mumps, invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), and pertussis were retrieved and compared the VPD incidences in 2020 to the average of the last 4 years (2015-2019) of the corresponding months. RESULTS: In 2020, there were 44% decline for mumps, 44% decline for varicella, 28% decline for pertussis, 22% decline for IPD, 14% decline in incidence of hepatitis A, and no change for hepatitis B incidences, compared to baseline years (2015-2019). The largest decline of total VPDs were in April (65%) and in May (67%), during the intensified social distancing measures.

We aimed to investigate the potential association between autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases and COVID-19 early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We did an exposure-driven, propensity score-matched study using a South Korean nationwide cohort linked to general health examination records. We analysed all South Korean patients aged older than 20 years who underwent SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing between Jan 1 and May 30, 2020, and received general health examination results from the Korean National Health Insurance Service. We defined autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (inflammatory arthritis and connective tissue diseases) based on the relevant ICD-10 codes, with at least two claims (outpatient or inpatient) within 1 year. The outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, severe COVID-19 (requirement of oxygen therapy, intensive care unit admission, application of invasive ventilation, or death), and COVID-19-related death. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were estimated after adjusting for the potential confounders. Findings: Between Jan 1 and May 30, 2020, 133 609 patients (70 050 [52·4%] female and 63 559 [47·6%] male) completed the general health examination and were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 4365 (3·3%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 8297 (6·2%) were diagnosed with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases. After matching, patients with an autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic disease showed an increased likelihood of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (adjusted OR 1·19, 95% CI 1·03-1·40; p=0·026), severe COVID-19 outcomes (1·26, 1·02-1·59; p=0·041), and COVID-19-related death (1·69, 1·01-2·84; p=0·046). Similar results were observed in patients with connective tissue disease and inflammatory arthritis. Treatment with any dose of systemic corticosteroids or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) were not associated with COVID-19-related outcomes, but those receiving high dose (&#8805;10 mg per day) of systemic corticosteroids had an increased likelihood of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adjusted OR 1·47, 95% CI 1·05-2·03; p=0·022), severe COVID-19 outcomes (1·76, 1·06-2·96; p=0·031), and COVID-19-related death (3·34, 1·23-8·90; p=0·017). Interpretation: Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases were associated with an increased likelihood of a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, worse clinical outcomes of COVID-19, and COVID-19-related deaths in South Korea.

New surveillance and control strategy was set up to detect emerging outbreaks. AIM: To detect and describe the evolution of COVID-19 clusters and cases during the 2020 summer in Spain. METHODS: A near-real time surveillance system to detect active clusters of COVID-19 was developed based on Kulldorf's prospective space-time scan statistic (STSS) to detect daily emerging active clusters. RESULTS: Analyses were performed daily during the summer 2020 (June 21st - August 31st) in Spain, showing an increase of active clusters and municipalities affected. Spread happened in the study period from a few, low-cases, regional-located clusters in June to a nationwide distribution of bigger clusters encompassing a higher average number of municipalities and total cases by end-August. CONCLUSION: STSS-based surveillance of COVID-19 can be of utility in a low-incidence scenario to help tackle emerging outbreaks that could potentially drive a widespread transmission. If that happens, spatial trends and disease distribution can be followed with this method. Finally, cluster aggregation in space and time, as observed in our results, could suggest the occurrence of community transmission.","Rosillo, Nicolás; Del-Águila-Mejía, Javier; Rojas-Benedicto, Ayelén; Guerrero-Vadillo, María; Peñuelas, Marina; Mazagatos, Clara; Segú-Tell, Jordi; Ramis, Rebeca; Gómez-Barroso, Diana",BMC Public Health,331,24

Little is known about the clinical characteristics of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the high-altitude region of China. We reported the clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Gansu province, China. METHODS: In this retrospective study, patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were consecutively enrolled from January 21, 2020 to February 11, 2020. The information on the epidemiological, clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, radiological features on admission, treatment and outcome were obtained with the final follow-up of March 13, 2020. On the basis of the median length of hospital stay, patients were further analyzed in two groups (long- vs. short-hospital stay). RESULTS: Of the 86 patients of COVID-19 in 11 cities of Gansu Province, the median hospital stay was 14.0 days (interquartile rang, 11.0-19.0 days). In the overall cohort, the median age was 41.0 years (interquartile rang, 31.0-54.3 years), and 48 (55.8%) patients were female. Forty (46.5%) had a history of exposure to epidemic regions, but none exposed to the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Common symptoms included fever (41, 47.7%), and cough (37, 43.0%). On admission, 30 (34.9%) and 58 (67.4%) patients had leukopenia and lymphopenia. According to chest CT scans, 53 (66.3%) of 80 patients showed bilateral pneumonia, and 19 (23.8%) of 80 patients showed unilateral pneumonia. Of the 15 asymptomatic cases, 10 (66.6%) cases were found CT findings of pneumonia. Besides, there were 65 (75.6%) patients with mild and moderate type of COVID-19. All 86 patients received antiviral and traditional Chinese medicine therapy, 53 (61.6%) received antibacterial therapy, and 3 (3.5%) patients received invasive ventilator mechanical ventilation. The proportion of patients received antibiotic treatment in long-hospital stay group was significantly higher than that in the short-hospital stay group (P=0.045). As of March 13, 2020, 84 (97.7%) patients were discharged, and two (2.3%) cases died.

Last-mile logistics service contributes a significant part of the e-commerce experience. In contrast to the traditional last-mile logistics services, smart logistics service with autonomous driving technologies provides a promising solution to reduce the delivery cost and to improve efficiency. However, the traffic conditions in complex traffic environments, such as those in China, are more challenging compared to those in well-developed countries. Many types of moving objects (such as pedestrians, bicycles, electric bicycles, and motorcycles, etc.) share the road with autonomous vehicles, and their behaviors are not easy to track and predict. This paper introduces a technical solution from JD.com, a leading E-commerce company in China, to the autonomous last-mile delivery in complex traffic environments. Concretely, the methodologies in each module of our autonomous vehicles are presented, together with safety guarantee strategies.

However, effective pharmacological treatments to combat sepsis-induced tissue hypoxia are not available. Emerging experimental and clinical evidence reveals an evolutionary conserved action of thyroid hormone (TH) to adapt injured tissue to hypoxic conditions via its action on p38 MAPK, Akt signaling pathways. In addition, TH has favorable effects on the immune system and viral load in infected tissue. Non-Thyroid Illness Syndrome is common in sepsis, acute myocardial infarction and trauma and is associated with increased mortality. Thus, TH may be a novel treatment in the setting of critical illness due to viral infection in which hypoxia prevails. The present study aims to address the efficacy and safety of acute administration of triiodothyronine (T3) in critically ill COVID-19 infected patients requiring mechanical respiratory support or Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). TRIAL DESIGN: This study is a phase II, parallel, 2-arm (1:1 ratio), multi-centre, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Male and female patients aged over 18 years old who are diagnosed with pulmonary infection due to COVID-19, admitted to Intensive Care Unit and requiring mechanical ventilation or ECMO will be enrolled in this trial. Patients will be excluded in cases of pregnancy, severe systemic disease with life expectancy less than 6 months, participation in another trial of an investigational drug or device, corticosteroid and/or sympathomimetic use before initiation of treatment. All data will be collected in electronic CRF files. Participants will start to be recruited from the ICU center of ""ATTIKO"" University Hospital in Greece. We aim to include two more clinical sites in the trial one from Greece and one from Germany INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention: T3 Solution for injection 10 µg/ml. The dose administered will be 0.8g/kg i.v. bolus and will be followed by an infusion of 0.113g. kg-1.h-1 i.v. for 48 hours (therapeutic dose). After the first 48h, a maintenance dose will be administered corresponding to 50% of the therapeutic dose (0.057g. kg-1.h-1 i.v.). Drug administration will stop after successful weaning or end of follow up (maximum 30 days). Comparator: Placebo with composition and dosage identical apart from the active substance. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome assessed in the present study will be the percentage of patients successfully weaned after 30 days of follow-up. Successful weaning is defined as no requirement for ventilatory support after extubation (mechanical support) or support from ECMO for 48 hours. RANDOMISATION: An allocation sequence to one of the groups will be prepared by the Sponsor of the study. A 1:1 treatment allocation will be adopted. An electronic CRF will be used incorporating IWRS in order to assure proper randomization and unblinding in emergency cases. The representative of the sponsor will get a copy of randomization codes. The information of the randomization codes will then be locked in the database until the time at which an interim analysis or final analysis is performed. BLINDING (MASKING): Participants, caregivers, and all investigators assessing the outcomes will be blinded to group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The sample size of 60 patients (that indicates 30 subjects for each group) will have 84% power to detect the estimated difference between the two study groups. The criterion for significance (alpha) has been set at 0.05 and the test is 2-tailed. TRIAL STATUS: Protocol number T3inj-02/ThySupport, version 03, May 11, 2020. The trial is not recruiting yet.

DESIGN: Before and after study. SETTIN: General Hospital, United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: All adult patients admitted to 6 acute elderly care/rehabilitation hospital wards between July and October 2018. METHODS: Baseline audit of PHH opportunities conducted over 6 weeks. Focus group with staff and survey of the public informed the development of a PHH bundle. Effect of bundle on PHH monitored by structured observation of HH opportunities over 12 weeks. RESULTS: During baseline 303 opportunities for PHH were observed; compliance with PHH was 13.2% (40/303; 95% confidence interval 9.9-7.5). In the evaluation of PHH bundle, 526 PHH opportunities were observed with HH occurring in 58.9% (310/526); an increase of 45.7% versus baseline (95% confidence interval 39.7%-51.0%; P < .001). CONCLUSION: Providing patients with multiwipe packs of handwipes is a simple, cost-effective approach to increasing PHH and reducing the risk of HCAI in hospital.

INTRODUCTION: According to data collected by the World Health Organization, by the autumn of 2020, all regions of the world were affected by SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. In Hungary, the first cases were detected in March 2020, and the epidemic, among several other patient rights issues, drew attention to the paramount importance of patient information, its compliance with the law, and the difficulties encountered in its application. During the last decades, the possibility of male partner involvement in birth has become increasingly popular in the process of family planning and starting a life together. Preparing fathers for childbirth and coordinating information restrictions that have changed due to the epidemic is a priority for obstetric departments. The full application of patient information requires a number of considerations to ensure that childbirth remains a positive memory for mother and father, even in a situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We wanted to analyze how the obstetric wards in Hungary were able to comply with the laws and procedures in force at the time of the pandemic, what measures became necessary for creating male partner involvement in births, and at the same time to ensure that the rights of the mother and the father are not violated. METHOD: We sent an online questionnaire to the head of the obstetrics department of all Hungarian state hospitals and clinics, using 14 multiple-choice questions. The data of the received questionnaires were also compared with the information related to male partner involvement in births published on the websites of the institutions. RESULTS: In the period from 20 March to 20 September 2020, in terms of informing pregnant couples, the service providers always followed the procedures in force, but in several cases this meant more financial expenditure and organization for them. CONCLUSION: Our data showed that those who give birth insist on the best possible information about conditions of male partner involvement in births, have the same expectations about the conditions of childbirth as during the epidemic-free period. If the information is satisfactory and detailed for them, they are more tolerant of adverse changes. In view of the epidemic, the possibility of father involvement in birth remained in all departments available, while maintaining appropriate epidemiological measures.

Handling large numbers of small multiples imposes challenges on many analytic tasks like inspection, comparison, navigation, or annotation. To address these challenges, we developed a framework and implemented a library called Piling.js for designing interactive piling interfaces. Based on the piling metaphor, such interfaces afford flexible organization, exploration, and comparison of large numbers of small multiples by interactively aggregating visual objects into piles. Based on a systematic analysis of previous work, we present a structured design space to guide the design of visual piling interfaces. To enable designers to efficiently build their own visual piling interfaces, Piling.js provides a declarative interface to avoid having to write low-level code and implements common aspects of the design space. An accompanying GUI additionally supports the dynamic configuration of the piling interface. We demonstrate the expressiveness of Piling.js with examples from machine learning, immunofluorescence microscopy, genomics, and public health.","Lekschas, Fritz; Zhou, Xinyi; Chen, Wei; Gehlenborg, Nils; Bach, Benjamin; Pfister, Hanspeter",,331,20

Here, we investigated whether a point of care (POC) approach to perioperative bleeding and coagulopathy based on rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) results could decrease perioperative blood loss and the perioperative consumption of blood products during lung transplantation. METHODS: Patients undergoing bilateral lung transplantation were randomized into two groups: In the first group, designated the ""non POC"" group, the management of perioperative bleeding and coagulopathy was based on the clinical experience of the anesthesiologist; in the second group, designated the ""POC"" group, the management of perioperative bleeding, and coagulopathy was based on the ROTEM results. RESULTS: After performing an interim statistical analysis, the project was prematurely terminated as the results were significantly in favor of the POC approach. Data were analyzed for the period January 2018 until June 2020 when 67 patients were recruited into the study. There was significantly decreased perioperative blood loss in the POC group (nâ¯=â¯31 patients) with pâ¯=â¯0.013, decreased perioperative consumption of RBC with pâ¯=â¯0.009, and decreased perioperative consumption of fresh frozen plasma with p < 0.0001 (practically no fresh frozen plasma was used in the POC group) without deteriorating clot formation in secondary and primary hemostasis as compared to the non POC group (nâ¯=â¯36). CONCLUSION: POC management of perioperative bleeding and coagulopathy based on ROTEM results is a promising strategy to decrease perioperative blood loss and the consumption of blood products in lung transplantation.","Durila, Miroslav; Vajter, Jaromir; Garaj, Michal; Pollert, Lukas; Berousek, Jan; Vachtenheim, Jiri; Vymazal, Tomas; Lischke, Robert",J Heart Lung Transplant,331,1

According to recommendations implemented by the Israeli Obstetric Anesthesia Society, which were implemented due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, we increased the rate of neuraxial anesthesia among deliveries. OBJECTIVES: To compare the rates of neuraxial anesthesia in our cesarean population before and during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. METHODS: We included consecutive women undergoing an elective cesarean delivery from two time periods: pre-SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (15 February 2019 to 14 April 2019) and during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (15 February 2020 to 15 April 2020). We collected demographic data, details about cesarean delivery, and anesthesia complications. RESULTS: We included 413 parturients undergoing consecutive elective cesarean delivery identified during the study periods: 205 before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and 208 during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We found a statistically significant difference in neuraxial anesthesia rates between the groups: before the pandemic (92/205, 44.8%) and during (165/208, 79.3%;P &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that patient and provider education about neuraxial anesthesia can increase its utilization. The addition of a trained obstetric anesthesiologist to the team may have facilitated this transition.","Binyamin, Y.; Heesen, P.; Gruzman, I.; Zlotnik, A.; Ioscovich, A.; Ronen, A.; Weiniger, C.

Lymphoma patients need to be distinguished from the general population because of their deficient immune status and intensive anti-tumor treatment. The impacts of cancer subtypes and treatment on COVID-19 infection are unclear. Case Presentation: We here report the case of a primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma patient who was infected with COVID-19 after intensive immunochemotherapy (DA-EPOCH-R). The patient developed a neutropenic fever during chemotherapy, and fever was persistent, although antibiotics were used. Initial chest CT was negative, and the patient received a throat swab test since the second CT showed evidence of pneumonia. With treatment with Arbidol Hydrochloride and LianHuaQingWen capsule, his COVID-19 was cured. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report focusing on COVID-19 infection in a lymphoma patient undergoing intensive immunochemotherapy. For those patients being treated with immunochemotherapy in epidemic areas, a reduced dose intensity of intensive chemotherapy should be considered, and the effect of immunotherapies such as rituximab on COVID-19 infection should be considered. The impacts of anti-cancer treatment on COVID-19 infection need to be explored further.","Li, Qiuhui; Zhu, Fang; Xiao, Yin; Liu, Tao; Liu, Xinxiu; Wu, Gang; Zhang, Liling",Front. Oncol.,331,24

Using data from our calculations we construct phase diagrams for the two metals in the region of very high compressions and obtain their melting curves. For tin at pressures <100 GPa and zero temperature, we did not find the region of stability of the body-centered orthorhombic (bco) phase, as it was earlier observed in experiments by Salamat et al. [Phys Rev. B 88, 104104 (2013)]. Our calculations suggest that one structural transition from the tetragonal to cubic phase, bctâbcc, occurs in perfect Sn crystal at T=0 K in the pressure range of about 27-32 GPa. But any deviation from perfection may cause an orthorhombic distortion of its tetragonal phase. At pressures above 100 GPa, the bccâhcp transition exists in both metals, and the phase boundary has a domed shape and does not rise in temperature above 2 kK. This behavior of the phase boundary with the increasing temperature is caused by the softer phonon modes of the bcc structure and the smaller contribution of lattice vibrations to the free energy of the crystal compared to the hcp phase. At pressures above 2.5 TPa and T&#8804;1 kK, lead can also undergo another structural transition, hcpâfcc, but at Ð¢>1.5 kK there must exist the more energetically preferable bccâfcc transition.","Smirnov, Nikolai A",J. phys. condens. matter,331,24
246823,246823,246823,Rethinking Hospital-Associated Disability for Patients With COVID-19,17.978224,7.596402,2020,"BACKGROUND: The peak of the global COVID-19 pandemic has not yet been reached, and many countries face the prospect of a second wave of infections before effective vaccinations will be available. After an initial phase of viral replication, some patients develop a second illness phase in which the host thrombotic and inflammatory responses seem to drive complications. Severe COVID-19 disease is linked to high mortality, hyperinflammation, and a remarkably high incidence of thrombotic events. We hypothesize a crucial pathophysiological role for the contact pathway of coagulation and the kallikrein-bradykinin pathway. Therefore, drugs that modulate this excessive thromboinflammatory response should be investigated in severe COVID-19. METHODS: In this adaptive, open-label multicenter randomized clinical trial, we compare low molecular weight heparins at 50 IU anti-Xa/kg twice daily-or 75 IU anti-Xa twice daily for intensive care (ICU) patients-in combination with aprotinin to standard thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In the case of hyperinflammation, the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist anakinra will be added on top of the drugs in the interventional arm. In a pilot phase, the effect of the intervention on thrombotic markers (D-dimer) will be assessed. In the full trial, the primary outcome is defined as the effect of the interventional drugs on clinical status as defined by the WHO ordinal scale for clinical improvement. DISCUSSION: In this trial, we target the thromboinflammatory response at multiple levels. We intensify the dose of low molecular weight heparins to reduce thrombotic complications. Aprotinin is a potent kallikrein pathway inhibitor that reduces fibrinolysis, activation of the contact pathway of coagulation, and local inflammatory response. Additionally, aprotinin has shown in vitro inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry. Because the excessive thromboinflammatory response is one of the most adverse prognostic factors in COVID-19, we will add anakinra, a recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, to the regimen in case of severely increased inflammatory parameters. This way, we hope to modulate the systemic response to SARS-CoV-2 and avoid disease progressions with a potentially fatal outcome. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The EU Clinical Trials Register 2020-001739-28 .

METHODS: Corneal densitometry (CD) values of 102 eyes were divided into three main groups: 33 DMEKs, 19 DSAEKs, and 50 healthy eyes without previous ocular surgery. The CD values were then analyzed and compared between the groups. We measured three main layers in depth and four different concentric zones at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS: In the DMEK group, total CD significantly decreased from 38.02 ± 10.21 grayscale units (GSU) to 31.13 ± 9.25 GSU (P < 0.01) between the first and the sixth month postoperative. In the DSAEK group, we found significant changes only between the first and three months after surgery (from 42.62 ± 9.31 GSU to 38.71 ± 10.53 GSU (P < 0.01). Regarding the concentric zones, CD in the DMEK group significantly decreased in the central zone from 33.55 ± 12.07 GSU to 30.63 ± 10.15 GSU (P < 0.01) and significantly increased in the periphery from 30.63 ± 10.15 GSU to 36.72 ± 9.37 GSU, (P < 0.01).

Operation Warp Speed aims to accelerate the development of a safe and effective vaccine by early 2021. Multiple vaccine candidates with reassuring safety and efficacy profiles have advanced to phase 3 clinical trials in adults. The purpose of this review is to describe the burden of COVID-19 in children, to update pediatricians about adult COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials, to discuss the importance of COVID-19 vaccine trials in children and to instill confidence in the established vaccine development and licensure processes. RECENT FINDINGS: Children of all ages are at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease manifestations. Children are also susceptible to downstream effects of COVID-19, including social isolation and interruption in education. Developing a pediatric COVID-19 vaccine could prevent disease, mitigate downstream effects and enable children to re-engage in their world. SUMMARY: Children could benefit both directly and indirectly from vaccination. In light of the safety and immunogenicity results from recent adult COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials, children should have the opportunity to be included in clinical trials in parallel to ongoing adult phase 3 clinical trials in a manner that is careful, methodical and transparent.","Kamidani, Satoshi; Rostad, Christina A; Anderson, Evan J",Curr. opin. pediatr,331,24

METHODS: To collect information on public sentiment regarding governments' reactions to COVID-19, we consider five factors for analysis: number of confirmed cases per million population, number of deaths per million population, and governments' containment and health policies, stringency policies, and economic support policies. We examine the Kendall correlations of variables in the 14 countries and use the wild bootstrap method for regression models to find important regressors. RESULTS: Our results show that people pay stronger attention to the results of their governments' battle against COVID-19 (number of confirmed cases and deaths per million population) rather than to what policies they initiate. Health policy and economic support do influence the approval of any national response to COVID-19. We also find that public satisfaction in Japan and South Korea toward the two governments' responses to the pandemic varies greatly compared to that of other countries' citizens to their governments' responses. CONCLUSIONS: The results herein offer some suggestions to governments when initiating policies to balance public health, livelihoods, and economic support.","Chen, Cathy W S; Lee, Sangyeol; Dong, Manh Cuong; Taniguchi, Masanobu",Int J Infect Dis,331,24

There is a paucity of population-based data on these phenomena for stroke. We examined the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the presentation and treatment of ischemic stroke in an entire population. Methods: We used linked provincial administrative data and data from the Quality Improvement and Clinical Research Alberta Stroke Program, a registry capturing stroke-related data on the entire population of Alberta(4.3 million), to identify all patients presenting with stroke in the pre-pandemic(1-January-2016 to 27-February-2020, n=19,531) and pandemic(28-February-2020 to 30-August-2020, n=2,255) periods. We examined changes in thrombolysis and endovascular therapy(EVT) rates, workflow, and in-hospital outcomes. Results: Hospitalizations/presentations for ischemic stroke dropped (weekly adjusted-incidence-rate-ratio[aIRR]:0.48, 95%CI:0.46-0.50, adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, pre-admission care needs), as did population-level incidence of thrombolysis(aIRR:0.49,0.44-0.56) or EVT(aIRR:0.59,0.49-0.69). However, the proportions of presenting patients receiving acute therapies did not decline (e.g. thrombolysis:11.7% pre-pandemic vs 13.1% during-pandemic, aOR:1.02,0.75-1.38). Onset-to-door times were prolonged; EVT recipients experienced longer door-to-reperfusion times (median door-to-reperfusion:110-minutes, IQR:77-156 pre-pandemic vs 132.5-minutes, 99-179 during-pandemic; adjusted-coefficient:18.7-minutes, 95%CI:1.45-36.0). Hospitalizations were shorter but stroke severity and in-hospital mortality did not differ. Interpretation: The first COVID-19 wave was associated with a halving of presentations and acute therapy utilization for ischemic stroke at a population level, and greater pre-hospital and in-hospital treatment delays. Our data can inform public health messaging and stroke care in current and future waves. Messaging should encourage attendance for emergencies and stroke systems should re-examine code stroke protocols to mitigate inefficiencies.","Ganesh, Aravind; Stang, Jillian M; McAlister, Finlay; Shlakhter, Oleksandr; Holodinsky, Jessalyn K; Mann, Balraj; Hill, Michael D; Smith, Eric E.",,331,20

However, little is known about the virus-host interaction of COVID-19 in sperm cells. We are the first to address the connection between changes in multiple seminal biomarkers and reproductive function in male patients recovering from COVID-19. In a prospective longitudinal cohort study, seminal ACE2 activity, markers of inflammation and oxidative stress, apoptotic variables, and semen quality parameters were evaluated at 10-day intervals for a maximum follow-up time of 60 days among male patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (n = 84) and healthy controls (CON; n = 105). At the baseline and the subsequent follow-ups, the COVID-19 group revealed significantly higher levels of seminal plasma ACE2 enzymatic activity, IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TGF-ß, TNF-&#945;, IFN-&#945;, IFN-Î³, ROS, caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 activity as well as lower levels of SOD activity than those in the CON group (P < 0.05). These perturbations tended to persist over time and were correlated with significant impairments in semen volume, progressive motility, sperm morphology, sperm concentration, and the number of spermatozoa. We provide the direct experimental evidence that the male reproductive system could be targeted and damaged by the COVID-19 infection. These findings go beyond our current understanding of the disease, suggesting that the reproductive function of the patients recovering from the disease should be precisely followed and evaluated to detect and avoid more serious reproductive problems in the future, as they may develop a transient state of male subfertility like those with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia.","Hajizadeh Maleki, Behzad; Tartibian, Bakhtyar",Reproduction,331,24

BACKGROUND: Homebound persons have a significantly higher mortality risk as well as physical and psychosocial burden. A clarification of the term is necessary to develop preventive measures. DESIGN: Concept analysis. DATA SOURCES: Scientific literature from electronic databases (CINAHL, Medline via PubMed, PsycINFO, PsycArticles, and Scopus) and definitions from online dictionaries. REVIEW METHODS: Walker and Avant's method was applied to guide the concept analysis. To prevent arbitrary and empty results in determining the attributes, antecedents, and consequences a thematic analysis was carried out. RESULTS: Homebound is defined as an enduring condition in which the life-space is reduced to the home, but moving around in the home is possible (by walking short distances alone or by holding on to furniture, or with the help of a stick, walker, or another person). Homebound has six attributes: in need of help in ADL/IADL and in leaving the life-space, powerlessness, life-space confinement, mobility limitation, endurance, and weakness. Physiological instability and physical immobility are antecedents with wide-ranging influencing factors as illness, complexity, burden, and endogenous/exogenous booster. Homebound has also wide-ranging consequences such as the progression of inactivity, physical, psychosocial, and/or spiritual problems. CONCLUSIONS: The multidimensional concept of homebound modifies the concepts of mobility and immobility. Given the extensive consequences of homebound nurses play a central role in the prevention.","Schirghuber, Johannes; Schrems, Berta",Nurs. forum,331,14

The growing infection rate and death toll demand the use of all possible approaches to design novel drugs and vaccines to curb this disease. In this study, we combined drugs repurposing and virtual drug screening strategies to target 3CLpro, which has an essential role in viral maturation and replication. A total of 31 FDA approved anti-HIV drugs, and Traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) database were screened to find potential inhibitors. As a result, Saquinavir, and five drugs (TCM5280805, TCM5280445, TCM5280343, TCM5280863, and TCM5458190) from the TCM database were found as promising hits. Furthermore, results from molecular dynamics simulation and total binding free energy revealed that Saquinavir and TCM5280805 target the catalytic dyad (His41 and Cys145) and possess stable dynamics behavior. Thus, we suggest that these compounds should be tested experimentally against the SARS-COV-2 as Saquinavir has been reported to inhibit HIV protease experimentally.

Reports of unrecognized anosmia in COVID-19 patients suggests that self-reported measures are insufficient for capturing patients with chemosensory dysfunction. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to quantify the impact of recent COVID-19 infection on chemosensory function and demonstrate the use of at-home objective smell and taste testing in an at-risk population of healthcare workers. Methods: Two hundred and fifty healthcare workers were screened for possible loss of smell and taste using online surveys. Self-administered smell and taste tests were mailed to respondents meeting criteria for elevated risk of infection, and one-month follow-up surveys were completed. Results: Among subjects with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, 73% reported symptoms of olfactory and/or gustatory dysfunction. Self-reported smell and taste loss were both strong predictors of COVID-19 positivity. Subjects with evidence of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection (<45 days) had significantly lower olfactory scores but equivalent gustatory scores compared to other subjects. There was a time-dependent increase in smell scores but not in taste scores among subjects with prior infection and chemosensory symptoms. The overall infection rate was 4.4%, with 2.5% reported by PCR swab. Conclusion: Healthcare workers with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection had reduced olfaction and normal gustation on self-administered objective testing compared to those without infection. Rates of infection and chemosensory symptoms in our cohort of healthcare workers reflect those of the general public.","Cao, Austin C; Nimmo, Zachary M; Mirza, Natasha; Cohen, Noam A; Brody, Robert M; Doty, Richard L",,331,24

Subsequently, meta-analysis of 40 non-overlapping studies, comprising of 4844 patients from seven countries, was conducted to see differences in clinical characteristics and laboratory outcomes across patients from different geographical regions (Wuhan, other parts of China and outside China), severity (non-severe, severe and fatal) and age groups (adults and children). Patients from Wuhan had a higher mean age (54.3 years) and rates of dyspnea (39.5%) compared with patients from other parts of China and outside China. Myalgia, fatigue, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and fatalities were also significantly more prevalent among Wuhan patients. A significant dose-response increase in prevalence of diabetes, D-dimer, white blood cells, neutrophil levels and ARDS was seen from non-severe to severe and fatal outcomes. A significant increase in mean duration of symptom onset to admission was seen between non-severe cases (4.2 days) and severe and fatal cases (6.3 days and 8.8 days, respectively). Proportion of asymptomatic cases was higher in children (20%) compared with adults (2.4%).

Commercial wildlife trade, and associated markets, are recognized mechanisms for zoonotic disease emergence, resulting in a growing global conversation around reducing human disease risks from spillover associated with hunting, trade, and consumption of wild animals. These discussions are especially relevant to people who rely on harvesting wildlife to meet nutritional, and cultural needs, including those in Arctic and boreal regions. Global policies around wildlife use and trade can impact food sovereignty and security, especially of Indigenous Peoples. We reviewed known zoonotic pathogens and current risks of transmission from wildlife (including fish) to humans in North American Arctic and boreal biomes, and evaluated the epidemic and pandemic potential of these zoonoses. We discuss future concerns, and consider monitoring and mitigation measures in these changing socio-ecological systems. While multiple zoonotic pathogens circulate in these systems, risks to humans are mostly limited to individual illness or local community outbreaks. These regions are relatively remote, subject to very cold temperatures, have relatively low wildlife, domestic animal, and pathogen diversity, and in many cases low density, including of humans. Hence, favorable conditions for emergence of novel diseases or major amplification of a spillover event are currently not present. The greatest risk to northern communities from pathogens of pandemic potential is via introduction with humans visiting from other areas. However, Arctic and boreal ecosystems are undergoing rapid changes through climate warming, habitat encroachment, and development; all of which can change host and pathogen relationships, thereby affecting the probability of the emergence of new (and re-emergence of old) zoonoses. Indigenous leadership and engagement in disease monitoring, prevention and response, is vital from the outset, and would increase the success of such efforts, as well as ensure the protection of Indigenous rights as outlined in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Partnering with northern communities and including Indigenous Knowledge Systems would improve the timeliness, and likelihood, of detecting emerging zoonotic risks, and contextualize risk assessments to the unique human-wildlife relationships present in northern biomes.","Keatts, Lucy O; Robards, Martin; Olson, Sarah H; Hueffer, Karsten; Insley, Stephen J; Joly, Damien O; Kutz, Susan; Lee, David S; Chetkiewicz, Cheryl-Lesley B; Lair, Stéphane; Preston, Nicholas D; Pruvot, Mathieu; Ray, Justina C; Reid, Donald; Sleeman, Jonathan M; Stimmelmayr, Raphaela; Stephen, Craig; Walzer, Chris",Front Public Health,331,17

Such antibodies provide protection against reinfection by the same strain of a pathogen. A highly mutable virus, like HIV or influenza, evades recognition by these strain-specific antibodies via the emergence of new mutant strains. A vaccine that elicits antibodies that can bind to many diverse strains of the virus-known as broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs)-could protect against highly mutable pathogens. Despite much work, the mechanisms by which bnAbs emerge remain uncertain. Using a computational model of affinity maturation, we studied a wide variety of vaccination strategies. Our results suggest that an effective strategy to maximize bnAb evolution is through a sequential immunization protocol, wherein each new immunization optimally increases the pressure on the immune system to target conserved antigenic sites, thus conferring breadth. We describe the mechanisms underlying why sequentially driving the immune system increasingly further from steady state, in an optimal fashion, is effective. The optimal protocol allows many evolving B cells to become bnAbs via diverse evolutionary paths.","Sprenger, Kayla G; Louveau, Joy E; Murugan, Pranav M; Chakraborty, Arup K",Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The basic treatments are mainly represented by antiviral drugs, even if the evidence is not satisfactory. Among the antivirals, the most promising appears to be remdesivir. Corticosteroids and tocilizumab seem to guarantee positive results in selected patients so far, although the timing of starting therapy and the most appropriate therapeutic schemes remain to be clarified. Efficacy of the other drugs is still uncertain, and they are currently used as a cocktail of treatments in the absence of definitive guidelines. What will represent the real solution to the enormous problem taking place worldwide is the identification of a safe and effective vaccine, for which enormous efforts and investments are underway.","Menzella, Francesco; Biava, Mirella; Barbieri, Chiara; Livrieri, Francesco; Facciolongo, Nicola",Drugs Context,331,14

As an alternative of the Diebold and Yilmaz (2012 and 2014) spillover methodology, this paper proposes the application of the fresh time-varying parameter vector autoregression (TVP-VAR) methodology by Antonakakis and Gabauer (2017) during the sample period between January 7, 2000 and September 17, 2020. In addition, this paper pays special attention to the most relevant periods of economic turbulence among the last 20 years: dotcom bubble, Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and COVID-19 pandemic crisis. About the main results, the directional return and volatility connectedness of oil risk shocks is higher than oil demand shocks and, in turn, higher than oil supply shocks. In addition, the dynamic total return and volatility connectedness changes over time, rising during periods of economic crisis. In general, the net return connectedness considerably increases during the three most important crises. Thus, the differences between transmitters' (Canola and Corn) and receivers’ (Orange Juice, Lean Hog, Sugar and Rubber) agricultural commodity markets are emphasized during the GFC and the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Finally, the net volatility connectedness measure would not show evidence as clear as the net return connectedness measure.","Umar, Zaghum Jareño Francisco Escribano Ana",Resources Policy,331,21

Measuring the level or significance of fear in different populations may help identify populations and areas in need of public health and education campaigns. We were interested in diagnostic tests developed to assess or diagnose COVID-19-related fear or phobia. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of studies that examined instruments diagnosing or assessing fear or phobia of COVID-19 (PROSPERO registration: CRD42020197100). We utilized the Norwegian Institute of Public Health's Live map of covid-19 evidence, a database of pre-screened and pre-categorized studies. The Live map of covid-19 evidence identified references published since 1 December 2019 in MEDLINE, Embase, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Following biweekly searches, two researchers independently categorized all studies according to topic (seven main topics, 52 subordinate topics), population (41 available groups), study design, and publication type. For this review, we assessed for eligibility all studies that had been categorized to the topic ""Experiences and perceptions, consequences; social, political, economic aspects"" as of 25 September 2020, in addition to hand-searching included studies' reference lists. We meta-analyzed correlation coefficients of fear scores to the most common reference tests (self-reports of anxiety, depression, and stress), and reported additional concurrent validity to other reference tests such as specific phobias. We assessed study quality using the QUADAS-2 for the minority of studies that presented diagnostic accuracy statistics. RESULTS: We found 18 studies that validated fear instruments. Fifteen validated the Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S). We found no studies that proposed a diagnosis of fear of COVID-19 or a threshold of significant/clinical versus non-significant/subclinical fear. Study quality was low, with the most common potential biases related to sampling strategy and un-blinded data analysis. The FSV-19S total score correlated strongly with severe phobia (r = 0.703, 95%CI 0.634-0.761) in one study, and moderately with anxiety in a meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of the FSV-19S needs to be measured further using fear-related reference instruments, and future studies need to provide cut-off scores and normative values. Further evaluation of the remaining three instruments is required.","Muller, Ashley Elizabeth; Himmels, Jan Peter William; Van de Velde, Stijn",BMC Med Res Methodol,331,1

In recent years, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 is the third highly pathogenic event and large-scale epidemic affecting the human population. It follows the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012. This novel SARS-CoV-2 employs the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, like SARS-CoV, and spreads principally in the respiratory tract. The viral spike (S) protein of coronaviruses facilities the attachment to the cellular receptor, entrance, and membrane fusion. The S protein is a glycoprotein and is critical to elicit an immune response. Glycosylation is a biologically significant post-translational modification in virus surface proteins. These glycans play important roles in the viral life cycle, structure, immune evasion, and cell infection. However, it is necessary to search for new information about viral behavior and immunological host's response after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The present review discusses the implications of the CoV-2 S protein glycosylation in the SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 interaction and the immunological response. Elucidation of the glycan repertoire on the spike protein can propel research for the development of an appropriate vaccine.","Ramírez Hernández, Eleazar; Hernández-Zimbrón, Luis Fernando; Martínez Zúñiga, Nayeli; Leal-García, Juan José; Ignacio Hernández, Violeta; Ucharima-Corona, Luis Eduardo; Pérez Campos, Eduardo; Zenteno, Edgar",Viral Immunol,331,5

However, despite that nutrition may change in a lockdown situation, little is known about the influence of malnutrition among subjects hospitalized due to COVID-19. Our study aimed to assess whether the presence of malnutrition among patients admitted due to COVID-19 had any impact on clinical outcomes compared with patients with the same condition but well nourished. METHODS: 75 patients admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 were analyzed cross-sectionally. Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) was completed by phone interview. Clinical parameters included were extracted from the electronic medical record. RESULTS: According to the SGA, 27 admitted due to a COVID-19 infection had malnutrition. Patients not well nourished were older than patients with a SGA grade A (65 ± 14.1 vs 49 ± 15.1 years; p < 0.0001). Length of hospital stay among poorly nourished patients was significantly higher (18.4 ± 15.6 vs 8.5 ± 7.7 days; p = 0.001). Mortality rates and admission to ICU were greater among subjects with any degree of malnutrition compared with well-nourished patients (7.4% vs 0%; p = 0.05 and 44.4% vs 6.3%; p < 0.0001). CRP (120.9 ± 106.2 vs 60.8 ± 62.9 mg/l; p = 0.03), D-dimer (1516.9 ± 1466.9 vs 461.1 ± 353.7 ng/mL; p < 0.0001) and ferritin (847.8 ± 741.1 vs 617.8 ± 598.7mcg/l; p = 0.03) were higher in the group with malnutrition. Haemoglobin (11.6 ± 2.1 vs 13.6 ± 1.5 g/dl; p < 0.0001) and albumin 3.2 ± 0.7 vs 4.1 ± 0.5 g/dl; p < 0.0001) were lower in patients with any degree of malnutrition. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a poor nutritional status is related to a longer stay in hospital, a greater admission in the ICU and a higher mortality.","Nicolau, Joana; Ayala, Luisa; Sanchís, Pilar; Olivares, Josefina; Dotres, Keyla; Soler, Ana-Gloria; Rodríguez, Irene; Gómez, Luis-Alberto; Masmiquel, Lluís",Clin Nutr ESPEN,331,1

The World Health Organization has called it the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Rapid dissemination of the virus occurs mainly through the saliva (Flugge's droplets) and aerosol, together with nasal and lachrymal passages. The literature associated with the recent advancement in terms of rapid diagnostics and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has thoroughly studied the role of ACE2 receptors and Furin, as well as viral agent access into the host cell and its significant persistence at the level of the oral mucosa, which represents the main access to the virus. The purpose of this review was to underline the processes of SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms and novel breakthroughs in diagnostics and vaccines. Different technologies, such as the RT-PCR molecular test and the antigenic test, have been developed to identify subjects affected by the SARS-CoV-2 in order to improve the tracking of infection geographical diffusion. Novel rapid and highly sensitive diagnostic tests has been proposed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 to improve the screening capability of suspected contagions. The strengthening of the vaccination campaign represents the most effective means to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection and prevent severe manifestations of the virus-different classes of vaccines have been developed for this purpose. Further attention on the novel SARS-CoV-2 variant is necessary in order to verify the protection efficacy and virulence reduction of the infective agent in the recent vaccine campaign.","Inchingolo, A.

The social network consists of more than 2 million nodes, each representing an inhabitant of Slovenia. The nodes are organised and interconnected according to the real household and elderly-care center distribution, while their connections outside these clusters are semi-randomly distributed and fully-linked. The virus spread model is coupled to the disease progression model. The ensemble approach with the perturbed transmission and disease parameters is used to quantify the ensemble spread, a proxy for the forecast uncertainty. The presented ongoing forecasts of COVID-19 epidemic in Slovenia are compared with the collected Slovenian data. Results show that infection is currently twice more likely to transmit within households/elderly care centers than outside them. We use an ensemble of simulations (N = 1000) to inversely obtain posterior distributions of model parameters and to estimate the COVID-19 forecast uncertainty. We found that in the uncontrolled epidemic, the intrinsic uncertainty mostly originates from the uncertainty of the virus biology, i.e. its reproductive number. In the controlled epidemic with low ratio of infected population, the randomness of the social network becomes the major source of forecast uncertainty, particularly for the short-range forecasts. Social-network-based models are thus essential for improving epidemics forecasting.","Zaplotnik, Ziga; Gavric, Aleksandar; Medic, Luka",,331,16

SARS-Cov-2 entry into a cell is dependent upon binding of the viral spike (S) protein to cellular receptor and on cleavage of the spike protein by the host cell proteases such as Cathepsin L and Cathepsin B. CTSL/B are crucial elements of lysosomal pathway and both enzymes are almost exclusively located in the lysosomes. CTSL disruption offers potential for CoVID-19 therapies. The mechanisms of disruption include: decreasing expression of CTSL, direct inhibition of CTSL activity and affecting the conditions of CTSL environment (increase pH in the lysosomes). We have conducted a high throughput drug screen gene expression analysis to identify compounds that would downregulate the expression of CTSL/CTSB. One of the top significant results shown to downregulate the expression of the CTSL gene is amantadine (10uM). Amantadine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1968 as a prophylactic agent for influenza and later for Parkinson's disease. It is available as a generic drug. Amantadine in addition to downregulating CTSL appears to further disrupt lysosomal pathway, hence, interfering with the capacity of the virus to replicate. It acts as a lysosomotropic agent altering the CTSL functional environment. We hypothesize that amantadine could decrease the viral load in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and as such it may serve as a potent therapeutic decreasing the replication and infectivity of the virus likely leading to better clinical outcomes. Clinical studies will be needed to examine the therapeutic utility of amantadine in COVID-19 infection.","Smieszek, Sandra P; Przychodzen, Bart P; Polymeropoulos, Mihael H",Int J Antimicrob Agents,331,16

RESULTS: The search yielded 78 studies presenting data on 77,443 people. Most studies (82%) were conducted in China. No studies included patients from low- and middle-income countries. The overall quality of included studies was low to moderate, and the majority of studies did not include a control group. Fever and cough were the most commonly reported symptoms early in the pandemic. Laboratory and imaging findings were diverse with lymphocytopenia and ground glass opacities the most common findings respectively. Clinical data in children and vulnerable populations were limited. CONCLUSIONS: The early Covid-19 literature had moderate to high risk of bias and presented several methodological issues. Early clinical characterisation studies should aim to include different at-risk populations, including patients in non-hospital settings. Pandemic preparedness requires collection tools to ensure observational studies are methodologically robust and will help produce high-quality data early on in the pandemic to guide clinical practice and public health policy.

As a large London transplant center serving a diverse patient population, we report the outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in our cohort of 2848 kidney and/or pancreas transplant patients. METHODS: Data were obtained retrospectively for all transplant patients who attended hospital during the peak of the pandemic and had a positive nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 test. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. Twenty percent were treated as outpatients, 59% were admitted to the general ward, and 21% required intensive care. Treatment consisted of reduced immunosuppression, antibiotics for pneumonia or sepsis, and other supportive treatments. Within our cohort, 12 patients died (18%), with an overall mortality of 0.4%. Predictive risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 severity were explored. CONCLUSIONS: Severe disease was associated with lower hemoglobin prior to coronavirus disease 2019 diagnosis and lower lymphocyte count at the time of diagnosis but not age, sex, ethnicity, or preexisting comorbidities. Lower glomerular filtration rate and higher C-reactive protein were associated with more severe disease. Despite no use of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, antiviral, or immunomodulatory medications, our mortality rate (kidney and pancreas transplant patients) is similar to current international rates.","Sran, K; Olsburgh, J; Kasimatis, T; Clark, K; Gökmen, R; Hilton, R; Shah, S; Shaw, C; Farmer, C; Kilbride, H; Asgari, E",Transplant. proc,331,24

Clinical suspicion is fundamental since it is an unusual entity with a progressive and often asymptomatic installation over a long period. The authors report a 70-year-old man with diabetic nephropathy who underwent a kidney transplant (KT) in August 2014 with good clinical evolution. No previous CMV infection or episodes of acute rejection were reported. Five years after transplant, he was admitted due to a reduced visual acuity of the left eye with seven days of evolution with associated hyperemia, without exudate. The ophthalmologic evaluation was compatible with acute necrosis of the retina and presumed associated with CMV infection. He had a progressive improvement after ganciclovir initiation. CMV retinitis is one of the most serious ocular complications in immune-suppressed individuals and can lead to irreversible blindness, and because of that, early diagnosis and treatment remains crucial in obtaining the best visual prognosis in affected patients. Secondary prophylaxis with ganciclovir is not consensual, neither is the safety of reintroducing the antimetabolite in these cases.","Silva, Filipa; Ficher, Klaus Nunes; Viana, Laila; Coelho, Inês; Rezende, Juliana Toniato; Wagner, Daniel; Vaz, Maria Lúcia; Foresto, Renato; Silva Junior, Helio Tedesco; Pestana, José Medina",J. bras. nefrol,331,15

Biplanar radiographies were acquired at baseline, immediate post-operatively, 1-year and 2-year follow-up, and 3D reconstruction of the spine and pelvis was performed. NTK and THK showed different global sagittal alignment, as well as differences compared to controls. AIS with THK at baseline had higher SVA/SFD (2.0 ± 2.9 vs - 0.4 ± 1.9; P < 0.05) and OD-HA (0.2 ± 1.4° vs - 1.3 ± 1.6°; P < 0.05) than controls, indicating that THK had compensated balance with unusual forward leaning posture. Immediately post-operation, SVA/SFD remained high (1.3 ± 3.0) while OD-HA reversed (- 1.2 ± 1.7°), indicating that THK patients had found partially compensated balance. After 2-yeas, both SVA/SFD (- 1.3 ± 2.1) and OD-HA (- 1.4 ± 0.9°) were normalized. The changes in global sagittal alignment and mechanism of balance are different in AIS with or without THK. As the head plays a critical role on balance during immediate and delayed post-operation, OD-HA can be complementary parameter for assessing global balance during post-operative follow-up of AIS patients with THK.","Yeung, Kwong Hang; Man, Gene Chi Wai; Skalli, Wafa; Hu, Zongshan; Hung, Vivian Wing Yin; Hung, Alec Lik Hang; Lam, Tsz Ping; Ng, Bobby Kin Wah; Cheng, Jack Chun Yiu; Vergari, Claudio; Chu, Winnie Chiu Wing",Sci Rep,331,15

As we learn more about the effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with the recognition that olfactory dysfunction is a key symptom of this disease process, there is a greater need than ever for evidence-based management of postinfectious olfactory dysfunction (PIOD). OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to provide an evidence-based practical guide to the management of PIOD (including post-coronavirus 2019 cases) for both primary care practitioners and hospital specialists. METHODS: A systematic review of the treatment options available for the management of PIOD was performed. The written systematic review was then circulated among the members of the Clinical Olfactory Working Group for their perusal before roundtable expert discussion of the treatment options. The group also undertook a survey to determine their current clinical practice with regard to treatment of PIOD. RESULTS: The search resulted in 467 citations, of which 107 articles were fully reviewed and analyzed for eligibility; 40 citations fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 11 of which were randomized controlled trials. In total, 15 of the articles specifically looked at PIOD whereas the other 25 included other etiologies for olfactory dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: The Clinical Olfactory Working Group members made an overwhelming recommendation for olfactory training; none recommended monocycline antibiotics. The diagnostic role of oral steroids was discussed; some group members were in favor of vitamin A drops.

The impact and course of COVID-19 infection in cancer patients receiving immunotherapy remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety of the management of patients with advanced melanoma treated with immunotherapy in 2 Cancer Centers located in areas of Italy with a high incidence of COVID-19 infections. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from January 1 to April 30, 2020 on patients with locally advanced and metastatic melanoma receiving immunotherapy at either Istituto Europeo di Oncologia or Città della Salute e della Scienza University Hospital. RESULTS: One-hundred and sixty-nine patients with stage III and IV melanoma were treated with an immunotherapy regimen at either Istituto Europeo di Oncologia or Città della Salute e della Scienza University Hospital. One-hundred and four patients continued treatment without interruption or delay, while 49 patients had a treatment delay. The main reasons for treatment delay were older age (median age of the group of patients with or without treatment-delay, respectively 60 and 69 years, P value <0.001) and/or presence of comorbidities (percentage of patients with at least one comorbidity respectively 81% and 62%, in patients with or without treatment delay, P valueâ¯=â¯0.001). One-hundred and twelve patients had at least 1 thoracic CT scan performed and radiological findings suspicious for COVID-19 were observed in only 7 cases (4%). Fifteen patients (9%) developed symptoms potentially related to COVID-19; nasopharyngeal swabs were collected in 9 patients and only 1 was positive for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 infection observed in our cohort of patients with advanced malignant melanoma treated with immunotherapy appears meaningfully lower as compared with that reported in the overall population in Italy as well as in patients affected by solid tumors. We conclude that in patients with locally advanced and metastatic melanoma, immunotherapy can be safely continued without delay in the majority of cases, reserving precautionary delay only for the most frail patients.","Pala, Laura; Conforti, Fabio; Saponara, Maristella; De Pas, Tommaso; Giugliano, Federica; Omodeo Salè, Emanuela; Jemos, Costantino; Rubatto, Marco; Agostini, Andrea; Quaglino, Pietro; Fava, Paolo; Fierro, Maria Teresa; Queirolo, Paola",Semin Oncol,331,16

However, the quality, functionality and location of GI in urban areas illustrated a disparity in distribution that meant that in many cases communities with higher ethnic diversity, lower income and greater health inequality suffered from insufficient access. This paper provides commentary on these issues, reflecting on how planners, urban designers and environmental organizations are positioning GI in decision-making to address inequality.

Methods The clinical data of 292 adult patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed, including 21 severe patients and 271 mild patients. The demographic characteristics, epidemiological history, history of underlying diseases and laboratory examinations were compared between the two groups. Measurement data were compared using t test or Mann-Whitney U test. The count data were compared using hi-square test. The binary logistic regression equation was used to analyze the risk factors for the progression of patients to severe cases. Results Among the 292 patients, 21 were severe cases with the rate of 7.2% (21/292). One patient died, and the mortality rate was 4.8% in severe patients. The severe patients aged (65.0±15.7) years old, 19 (90.5%) were male, 11 (52.4%) had underlying diseases, 7 (33.3%) had close relatives diagnosed with COVID-19. The mild patients aged (48.7±15.7) years old, 135 (49.8%) were male, 74 (27.3%) had underlying diseases, 36 (13.3%) had close relatives diagnosed with COVID-19. The differences between two groups were all significant statistically ( t =-4.730, χ 2 =12.930, 5.938 and 4.744, respectively, all P <0.05).

Results A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of distress measured by IES-R: 47 (33.6%) mild, 45 (32.1%) moderate and 37 (26.4%) severe. SRQ-20 total score was positive in 82 (58.6%) patients, particularly in the female population (p = 0.009) with an age between 45-65 years (p = 0.020). In multiple regression analysis, being actively working (Beta = 0.15, p = 0.03) and SRQ-20 (Beta = 0.56, p = 0.00) significantly predicted IES-R total score.

Across the experiments, a global pattern was discriminated under conditions of less familiarization than was necessary for local elements to be discriminated, thus indicating a global precedence in the sequence of visual processing at 3 months of age. Patterns of discrimination were also observed to vary as a function of individual differences in infants' look duration. Furthermore, the pattern of novelty and familiarity preferences for short-looking infants varied in complex ways as a function of familiarization time: Preferences for novel global properties were supplanted by familiarity preferences at the point in familiarization at which infants first became sensitive to local properties.","Frick, Janet E; Colombo, John; Allen, Jennifer Ryther",Infancy,331,16

Convalescent Plasma Therapy has been authorized as an off-label therapeutic procedure. We assessed the outcome of convalescent plasma (CP) units versus standard treatment on the complete recovery, improvement and 28 days' mortality of COVID 19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present was multi-centric case controlled observational prospective study. The study was conducted for a period of four and half months from July 15 2020 to 30 November 2020 after taking approval from the Expert Committee, Health & Family Welfare Department, Government of Odisha. Plasma therapy was applied on two groups of 1189 serious COVID patients (959 number of pre- critical and 230 number of critical patients) not responding to oxygen therapy. It was compared with non- transfused control group of 1243 patients (996 number of pre-critical and 247 number of critical patients). RESULTS: Discharge was better in (55.5%) transfused than (43%)in non-transfused pre-critical patients and the mortality was lower (44.3%) in transfused, (48.9%) than non-transfused critical patients respectively. Complete recovery was highest in those who were transfused with CP with neutralizing titer more than 1:160 (52.5%), 18-30 years' age group (64%), females (53%), 'O' Rh D positive blood group (51.5%). There was no adverse reaction due to CP transfusion. CONCLUSIONS: CP is effective in improving the recovery rate with earlier discharge and decrease in the 28 days' mortality than in the control non-transfused group. CP with neutralizing antibody titer more than 1:160 has the best outcome with complete recovery and decrease in the mortality. It is more effective in treating pre-critical patients when transfused early, in female patients, in younger age group and in blood group 'O' Rh D positive.","Mahapatra, S; Rattan, R; Mohanty, C B K",Transfus. clin. biol,331,16

OBJECTIVES: We identified risk factors associated with increased risk of hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality in inner North East London (NEL) during the first UK COVID-19 wave. METHODS: Multivariate logistic regression analysis on linked primary and secondary care data from people aged 16 or older with confirmed COVID-19 infection between 01/02/2020 and 30/06/2020 determined odds ratios (OR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and P-values for the association between demographic, deprivation and clinical factors with COVID-19 hospitalisation, ICU admission and mortality. RESULTS: Over the study period, 1781 people were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 1195 (67%) were hospitalised, 152 (9%) admitted to ICU and 400 (23%) died. Results confirm previously identified risk factors: being male, or of Black or Asian ethnicity, or aged over 50. Obesity, type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) increased the risk of hospitalisation. Obesity increased the risk of being admitted to ICU. Underlying CKD, stroke and dementia increased the risk of death. Having learning disabilities was strongly associated with increased risk of death (OR = 4.75, 95% CI = [1.91, 11.84], P = .001). Having three or four co-morbidities increased the risk of hospitalisation (OR = 2.34, 95% CI = [1.55, 3.54], P < .001; OR = 2.40, 95% CI = [1.55, 3.73], P < .001 respectively) and death (OR = 2.61, 95% CI = [1.59, 4.28], P < .001; OR = 4.07, 95% CI = [2.48, 6.69], P < .001 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We confirm that age, sex, ethnicity, obesity, CKD and diabetes are important determinants of risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation or death. For the first time, we also identify people with learning disabilities and multi-morbidity as additional patient cohorts that need to be actively protected during COVID-19 waves.","Cummins, Lisa; Ebyarimpa, Irene; Cheetham, Nathan; Tzortziou Brown, Victoria; Brennan, Katie; Panovska-Griffiths, Jasmina",Influenza other respir. viruses,331,4

In this study, pre-processing is used to reduce the effect of intensity variations between CT slices. Then histogram thresholding is used to isolate the background of the CT lung scan. Each CT lung scan undergoes a feature extraction which involves deep learning and a Q-deformed entropy algorithm. The obtained features are classified using a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network classifier. Subsequently, combining all extracted features significantly improves the performance of the LSTM network to precisely discriminate between COVID-19, pneumonia and healthy cases.

METHODS: We performed a prospective, single-center, point of care validation of two Ag-RDT in comparison to RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. RESULTS: Between October 9th and 23rd, 2020, 1064 participants were enrolled. The PanbioTM Covid-19 Ag Rapid Test device (Abbott) was validated in 535 participants, with 106 positive Ag-RDT results out of 124 positive RT-PCR individuals, yielding a sensitivity of 85.5% (95% CI: 78.0-91.2). Specificity was 100.0% (95% CI: 99.1-100) in 411 RT-PCR negative individuals. The Standard Q Ag-RDT (SD Biosensor, Roche) was validated in 529 participants, with 170 positive Ag-RDT results out of 191 positive RT-PCR individuals, yielding a sensitivity of 89.0% (95%CI: 83.7-93.1). One false positive result was obtained in 338 RT-PCR negative individuals, yielding a specificity of 99.7% (95%CI: 98.4-100). For individuals presenting with fever 1-5 days post symptom onset, combined Ag-RDT sensitivity was above 95%. Lower sensitivity of 88.2% was seen on the same day of symptom development (day 0). CONCLUSIONS: We provide an independent validation of two widely available commercial Ag-RDTs, both meeting WHO criteria of &#8805;80% sensitivity and &#8805;97% specificity.

The association of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid markers, such as galactomannan, with the presence of Aspergillus infections is also unclear. Methods: Our cohort included all patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Northwestern Memorial Hospital ICU from March to November 2020 who were intubated and underwent a BAL;patients were identified as having COVID-19 by the presence of a flag in the electronic medical record. We evaluated BAL fluid data for fungal organisms and markers. Data analysis was performed in Excel and Prism, with non-parametric values compared by two-tailed Mann Whitney tests. Results: We identified 274 patients meeting study entry criteria. The median (interquartile range) age was 62 years (47-69), and 93 (34%) were female. 714 BALs were performed on these patients, and 457 galactomannan tests were sent from these BALs. Only six (2.2%) patients grew Aspergillus on BAL fluid culture;one patient never grew Aspergillus but given his significantly elevated BAL galactomannan of 7.81, was empirically treated. The median (IQR) optical density index of galactomannan for the BAL samples that grew Aspergillus was 6.69 (3.37-8.87) compared with 0.08 (0.06-0.13) for those that did not, p&lt;0.001. Using our lab's reported galactomannan index cutoff of &gt;0.5 as positive, with patients who grew Aspergillus on culture as gold standard, the test sensitivity was 91.7% and specificity was 94.6%;using the ATS recommended cutoff of &gt;1.0 as positive, the sensitivity was 75.0% and specificity was 97.5%. The median (IQR) age of patients who grew Aspergillus was 71.5 years (64-80.5) (p=0.02 compared with the overall cohort). Only two were immunocompromised (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and another was status post liver transplant). Of note, two patients who grew Aspergillus had visible mold or plaque seen during bronchoscopy;three had cavitary findings on imaging;three died. Conclusions: Aspergillus superinfection is uncommon among ventilated patients with COVID-19 but can occur in patients without typical immunocompromising risk factors. BAL fluid galactomannan levels are lower in patients without Aspergillus, and had reasonable specificity especially if cutoff of &gt;1.0 was used. Future analysis should focus on additional factors that differentiate between these two groups.","Gao, C.; Nannapaneni, P.; Schneider, D.; Pickens, C.; Kang, M.; Rasmussen, L.; Cuttica, M.

To alleviate the challenges of small dataset sizes, these systems often rely on pretraining. In this work, we aim to assess the broader implications of these approaches. For diabetic retinopathy grading as exemplary use case, we compare the impact of different training procedures including recently established self-supervised pretraining methods based on contrastive learning. To this end, we investigate different aspects such as quantitative performance, statistics of the learned feature representations, interpretability and robustness to image distortions. Our results indicate that models initialized from ImageNet pretraining report a significant increase in performance, generalization and robustness to image distortions. In particular, self-supervised models show further benefits to supervised models. Self-supervised models with initialization from ImageNet pretraining not only report higher performance, they also reduce overfitting to large lesions along with improvements in taking into account minute lesions indicative of the progression of the disease. Understanding the effects of pretraining in a broader sense that goes beyond simple performance comparisons is of crucial importance for the broader medical imaging community beyond the use-case considered in this work.","Srinivasan, Vignesh; Strodthoff, Nils; Ma, Jackie; Binder, Alexander; Muller, Klaus-Robert; Samek, Wojciech",,331,1

The ""Regeneración Urbana, Calidad de Vida y Salud"" (Urban Regeneration, Quality of Life, and Health) or RUCAS project is a longitudinal, multi-method study that will evaluate the impact of an intervention focused on dwellings, built environment and community on the health and wellbeing of the population in two social housing neighborhoods in Chile. METHODS: RUCAS consists of a longitudinal study where inhabitants exposed and unexposed to the intervention will be compared over time within the study neighborhoods (cohorts), capitalizing on interventions as a natural experiment. Researchers have developed a specific conceptual framework and identified potential causal mechanisms. Proximal and more distal intervention effects will be measured with five instruments, implemented pre- and post-interventions between 2018 and 2021: a household survey, an observation tool to evaluate dwelling conditions, hygrochrons for measuring temperature and humidity inside dwellings, systematic observation of recreational areas, and qualitative interviews. Survey baseline data (956 households, 3130 individuals) is presented to describe sociodemographics, housing and health characteristics of both cohorts, noting that neighborhoods studied show worse conditions than the Chilean population. DISCUSSION: RUCAS' design allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the effects that the intervention could have on various dimensions of health and health determinants. RUCAS will face some challenges, like changes in the intervention process due to adjustments of the master plan, exogenous factors -including COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns- and lost to follow-up. Given the stepped wedge design, that the study capitalizes on within household changes over time, the possibility of adjusting data collection process and complementarity of methods, RUCAS has the flexibility to adapt to these circumstances. Also, RUCAS' outreach and retention strategy has led to high retention rates. RUCAS will provide evidence to inform regeneration processes, highlighting the need to consider potential health effects of regeneration in designing such interventions and, more broadly, health as a key priority in urban and housing policies.","Baeza, Fernando; Vives Vergara, Alejandra; González, Francisca; Orlando, Laura; Valdebenito, Roxana; Cortinez-O039,; Ryan, Andrea; Slesinski, Claire; Diez Roux, Ana V",BMC Public Health,331,20

During COVID-19, delivering medical service was negatively affected. AIMS: To describe the impact of COVID-19 on psoriasis healthcare delivery, management, and practice. METHODS: This observational cross-sectional study was conducted on 197 dermatologists using a validated online questionnaire. The survey evaluated the effect of COVID-19 on the decisions, prescription patterns, appointments rescheduling, and healthcare delivery for psoriasis patients by dermatologists. The questionnaire was developed and validated with a reliability score >0.7. RESULTS: During the pandemic, most dermatologists delayed initiating biological/immunosuppressive therapy for psoriasis unless urgently needed by the patient. For patients already receiving biologics or immunosuppressive treatment, most dermatologists favored continuation of therapy. Almost half (44.2%) of participants do not perform SARS-CoV-2 PCR screening before initiating biologics/immunosuppressive therapy. Dermatologists also reported an increased prescription of topical medications (79.2%), natural sunlight (28.4%), acitretin (26.9%), and home UVB (21.3%). Opinions regarding the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 treatment/prophylaxis for psoriasis patients were controversial. Intervals between face-to-face follow-up visits were prolonged by 71.6% of dermatologists. More than half of participants reported that their patients discontinued treatment without medical consultation. More than three fourth of responders either agreed or strongly agreed that COVID-19 negatively affected psoriasis patients. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has a negative impact on psoriasis management and healthcare delivery. Dermatologists are cautious about using biologics and immunosuppressive drugs during the pandemic, making case-by-case decisions. Psoriasis patients need compliance monitoring, and psychological support during the pandemic, which can be facilitated by teledermatology.","El-Komy, Mohamed H M; Abdelnaby, Asmaa; El-Kalioby, Mona",J Cosmet Dermatol,331,20

However during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, public and private insurers rapidly expanded access to telehealth in order to reduce exposure and avoid transmission. It is unknown whether telehealth will become a more regular substitute for in-person care beyond the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to provide evidence on the value of telehealth by comparing the productivity of physicians and other specialized clinicians who provide telehealth with the productivity of those who do not. RESEARCH DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective data analysis of 17,705 unique providers in the areas of internal medicine, cardiology, dermatology, psychiatry, psychology, and optometry practicing in the US veterans affairs health care system during the period 2015 to 2018. For each year, we measured individual providers productivity by the total number of relative value units (RVUs) per full-time equivalent (FTE). We estimated the impact of providing telehealth on RVUs/FTE using fixed effects regression models estimated on a panel dataset of 58,873 provider-year observations and controlling for provider and patient characteristics. RESULTS: Overall provider productivity increased in veterans affairs over the period, particularly in cardiology and dermatology. Providers of telehealth had above average productivity by 124 RVUs/FTE, or â¼4% of average total provider productivity. For the highest quartile of telehealth providers, average productivity was 188 RVUs/FTE higher than productivity of other providers. CONCLUSION: Strategies that encourage long-term integration of telehealth into provider practices may contribute to overall health care value.","Stefos, Theodore; Carey, Kathleen; Shen, Mei-Ling; Poe, Stacy; Oh, Dennis H; Moran, Eileen",Med Care,331,32

We examined those perceptions among Students of Agronomy, Soil, and Environmental Sciences (SASES). The goals were to determine how changes in education during the COVID-19 pandemic, i) changed student perceptions of online education, ii) shifted student comfort with online education and communication, and iii) highlighted issues limiting student success. A link to an online survey was sent to SASES members in late 2020 resulting in 31 responses. Course format shifted from mostly face-to-face delivery to synchronous and asynchronous online delivery following the COVID-19 shutdown. Students perceived decreased instructor effort and increased student effort. Nearly all students had access to devices. However, access to fast, reliable internet was a common issue. A small percentage of students were more likely to take online courses after the pandemic, yet a majority were now more comfortable taking online classes and using virtual meeting software. Student concern for COVID-19 was low. However, most reported wearing masks in buildings and on campus. Students reported increases and decreases in hours worked, with both changes resulting in perceived positive and negative academic impacts.

Despite the sensitivity of habits to context changes, little remains known about the influence of a context change on the interplay between PA habits and behaviours. We investigated the evolution of PA habits amidst the spring COVID-19 lockdown, a major context change. Moreover, we examined the association of PA behaviours and autonomous motivation with this evolution. DESIGN: Three-wave observational longitudinal design. METHODS: PA habits, behaviours, and autonomous motivation were collected through online surveys in 283 French and Swiss participants. Variables were self-reported with reference to three time-points: before-, mid-, and end-lockdown. RESULTS: Mixed effect modelling revealed a decrease in PA habits from before- to mid-lockdown, especially among individuals with strong before-lockdown habits. Path analysis showed that before-lockdown PA habits were not associated with mid-lockdown PA behaviours (ß = -.02, p = .837), while mid-lockdown PA habits were positively related to end-lockdown PA behaviours (ß = .23, p = .021). Autonomous motivation was directly associated with PA habits (ps < .001) and withto before- and mid-lockdown PA behaviours (ps < .001) (but not with end-lockdown PA behaviours) and did not moderate the relations between PA behaviours and habits (ps > .072). CONCLUSION: PA habits were altered, and their influence on PA behaviours was impeded during the COVID-19 lockdown. Engagement in PA behaviours and autonomous motivation helped in counteracting PA habits disruption.","Maltagliati, Silvio; Rebar, Amanda; Fessler, Layan; Forestier, Cyril; Sarrazin, Philippe; Chalabaev, Aïna; Sander, David; Sivaramakrishnan, Hasmini; Orsholits, Dan; Boisgontier, Matthieu P; Ntoumanis, Nikos; Gardner, Benjamin; Cheval, Boris",Br. j. health psychol,331,23

The treatment guidelines for COVID-19 vary between countries, yet there is no approved treatment to date. Aim: To report any evidence of therapeutics used for the management of patients with COVID-19 in clinical practice since emergence of the virus. Methods: A systematic review protocol was developed based on the PRISMA statement. Articles for review were selected from Embase, Medline and Google Scholar. Readily accessible peer-reviewed, full articles in English published from 1 stDecember 2019 to 26 thMarch 2020 were included. The search terms included combinations of: COVID, SARS-COV-2, glucocorticoids, convalescent plasma, antiviral and antibacterial. There were no restrictions on the types of study eligible for inclusion. Results: Four hundred and forty-nine articles were identified in the literature search; of these, 41 studies were included in this review. These were clinical trials (N=3), case reports (N=7), case series (N=10), and retrospective (N=11) and prospective (N=10) observational studies. Thirty-six studies were conducted in China (88%). Corticosteroid treatment was reported most frequently (N=25), followed by lopinavir (N=21) and oseltamivir (N=16). Conclusions: This is the first systematic review to date related to medication used to treat patients with COVID-19. Only 41 studies were eligible for inclusion, most of which were conducted in China. Corticosteroid treatment was reported most frequently in the literature.","Tobaiqy, M.; Qashqary, M.; Al-Dahery, S.; Mujallad, A.; Hershan, A. A.; Kamal, M. A.; Helmi, N.",Infect. Preven. Prac.,331,8

The pathobiology of this virus is still incompletely known, and it is therefore important to explore the impact of COVID-19 infections on olfactory and gustatory functions. We aimed to review current evidence on olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions caused by COVID-19. METHODS: This study was a narrative review performed in 2020 to investigate the olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions of the COVID-19. We searched eight keywords in six databases to determine the related documents on the main objective of the study. To discover studies meeting the inclusion criteria, the authors screened the titles and abstracts of the identified articles. The appropriate studies were included and their results were discussed to make the final selection. RESULTS: We have studied 24 current articles on the olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions due to COVID-19. A review of current studies has shown that we have a surge in the spread of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions that happened during the epidemic of COVID-19 infection. Most studies (95.8%) have confirmed the symptoms of anosmia in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. A review of current studies showed that, in addition to anosmia, evidence of ageusia and dysgeusia (parageusia) was also seen in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The results of our study support recent reports that SARS-CoV-2 may infect oral and nasal tissues and cause olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions. These findings may aid future research on the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19 consequences.","Mehraeen, Esmaeil; Behnezhad, Farzane; Salehi, Mohammad Amin; Noori, Tayebeh; Harandi, Hamid; SeyedAlinaghi, SeyedAhmad",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,331,24

In January 2020, the first transmission to healthcare workers (HCWs) was described. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted between people because of contact, droplets, and airborne. Airborne transmission is caused by aerosols that remain infectious when suspended in air over long distances and time. In the clinical setting, airborne transmission may occur during aerosol generating procedures like flexible bronchoscopy. To date, although the role of children in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is not clear the execution of bronchoscopy is associated with a considerably increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to HCWs. The aim of this overview is to summarize available recommendations and to apply them to pediatric bronchoscopy. We performed systematic literature searches using the MEDLINE (accessed via PubMed) and Scopus databases. We reviewed major recommendations and position statements published at the moment by the American Association for Bronchology and Interventional Pulmonology, WHO, European Center for Disease Prevention and Control and expert groups on the management of patients with COVID-19 to limit transmission among HCWs. To date there is a lack of recommendations for safe bronchoscopy during the pandemic period. The main indications concern adults and little has been said about children.

METHODS: A multicenter retrospective survey was performed addressing the medical specialties present in the ICUs and the increase in bed capacity during this period. RESULTS: Sixty-seven centers (62.04%) answered the questionnaire. The ICU bed capacity during the pandemic outbreak increased by 160% (95% confidence interval [CI], 128.97-191.03%). The average number of beds per intensive care medicine (ICM) specialist was 1.5 ± 0.60 and 3.71 ± 2.44 beds/specialist before and during the COVID-19 outbreak, respectively. Non-ICM specialists and residents were present in 50 (74.63%) and 23 (34.3%) ICUs during the outbreak, respectively.

The main objective is to establish the basic pillars of the concentrated table of population financial indicators in terms of the values of absolute primary indicators, on the basis of which the values of the three relevant relative indicators that characterize the financial situation of the population were calculated directly for the potential and performance of the national economy, especially in the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The research methodology was based on a series of numerical data from public databases, tools, and appropriate research methods based on the calculation of primary indicators, and indicators derived by appropriate calculation formulas, for the identification of factors influencing the financial status of the population at and a comparative analysis of the financial assets and liabilities of households in Romania and the European Union. The results of the paper are given by the evolution of primary indicators on the characterization of the financial situation of the population in 2007–2019, especially for the active population, and are directly influenced by the quality of eligible employment and employed adults, as well as the sustainability of the national economy. The personal contribution of the research team consists of the mathematical correlations given by the population finances for the economy of a state, which are extremely relevant, especially since, depending on their positive or negative levels, systemic financial and social imbalances are created with direct impact on the sustainability of the national economy. Thus, we want to determine these financial indicators relevant to the economy. Additionally, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the related issues to the population finances have aggravated and as such, there is a need for structural changes and adoptions. Finally, as an immediate and less costly solution, this study comes up with the suggestion of shifting the national economy toward frugality, therefore, significantly supporting sustainable development.","Manta, Otilia Hysa Eglantina Kruja Alba",Sustainability,331,1

Epidemic control strategies have also caused damage to the economy by cutting off humans' daily commute. In this paper, we develop an Individual-based Reinforcement Learning Epidemic Control Agent (IDRLECA) to search for smart epidemic control strategies that can simultaneously minimize infections and the cost of mobility intervention. IDRLECA first hires an infection probability model to calculate the current infection probability of each individual. Then, the infection probabilities together with individuals' health status and movement information are fed to a novel GNN to estimate the spread of the virus through human contacts. The estimated risks are used to further support an RL agent to select individual-level epidemic-control actions. The training of IDRLECA is guided by a specially designed reward function considering both the cost of mobility intervention and the effectiveness of epidemic control. Moreover, we design a constraint for control-action selection that eases its difficulty and further improve exploring efficiency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that IDRLECA can suppress infections at a very low level and retain more than 95% of human mobility.","Feng, Tao; Song, Sirui; Xia, Tong; Li, Yong",,331,16

Of these seaweeds, Ecklonia radiata (E. radiata) is found abundantly along South Australian coastal regions; however it has not been explored for various biological activities relative to any component phlorotannins previously ascribed neuroprotective capacity. In the present study, we evaluated neuroprotective activity against the neurotoxic amyloid ß protein (Aß1-42) of an ethanol extract of E. radiata compared with various additional solvent-solubilised fractions in a neuronal PC-12 cell line. The ethyl acetate fraction comprising 62% phlorotannins demonstrated the most efficacious neuroprotective activity, inhibiting neurotoxicity at all Aß1-42 concentrations. In addition, this fraction demonstrated a significant reduction in Aß aggregate density, but did not alter overall aggregate morphology. Centrifugal partitioning chromatography was used to isolate the major component, eckol, in high yield and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to characterize the major components of the ethyl acetate fraction. Our results demonstrate that the prevalence of eckol-type phlorotannins are associated with neuroprotective bioactivity of E. radiata, suggestive of potential nutraceutical and biopharmaceutical uses of this brown seaweed phlorotannin in dementia.","Shrestha, Srijan; Zhang, Wei; Begbie, Alexander J; Pukala, Tara L; Smid, Scott D",Food funct,331,14

This study aims to test whether the number of inbound overseas travelers and meteorological conditions are associated with the onset week of HRSV epidemic season. The estimation of onset week for 46 prefectures (except for Okinawa prefecture) in Japan for 4-year period (2014-2017) was obtained from previous papers based on the national surveillance data. We obtained data on the yearly number of inbound overseas travelers and meteorological (yearly mean temperature and relative humidity) conditions from Japan National Tourism Organization (JNTO) and Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), respectively. Multi-level mixed-effects linear regression analysis showed that every 1 person (per 100,000 population) increase in number of overall inbound overseas travelers led to an earlier onset week of HRSV epidemic season in the year by 0.02 week (coefficient -0.02; P<0.01). Higher mean temperature and higher relative humidity were also found to contribute to an earlier onset week by 0.30 week (coefficient -0.30; P<0.05) and 0.18 week (coefficient -0.18; P<0.01), respectively. Additionally, models that included the number of travelers from individual countries (Taiwan, South Korea, and China) except Australia showed that both the number of travelers from each country and meteorological conditions contributed to an earlier onset week. Our analysis showed the earlier onset week of HRSV epidemic season in Japan is associated with increased number of inbound overseas travelers, higher mean temperature, and relative humidity. The impact of international travelers on seasonality of HRSV can be further extended to investigations on the changes of various respiratory infectious diseases especially after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","Wagatsuma, Keita; Koolhof, Iain S; Shobugawa, Yugo; Saito, Reiko",PLoS One,331,16

It has spread worldwide with over 83,000,000 infected cases and more than 1,800,000 deaths to date (December 31, 2020). This research proposes a statistical monitoring scheme in which an optimized np control chart is utilized by sentinel metropolitan airports worldwide for early detection of coronavirus and other respiratory virus outbreaks. The sample size of this chart is optimized to ensure the best overall performance for detecting a wide range of shifts in the infection rate, based on the available resources, such as the inspection rate and the allowable false alarm rate. The effectiveness of the proposed optimized np chart is compared with that of the traditional np chart with a predetermined sample size under both sampling inspection and 100% inspection. For a variety of scenarios including a real case, the optimized np control chart is found to substantially outperform its traditional counterpart in terms of the average number of infections. Therefore, this control chart has potential to be an effective tool for early detection of respiratory virus outbreaks, promoting early outbreak investigation and mitigation.","Haridy, Salah; Maged, Ahmed; Baker, Arthur W; Shamsuzzaman, Mohammad; Bashir, Hamdi; Xie, Min",Comput Ind Eng,331,26

It is known that podocytes express the Rabphilin 3A (RPH3A)-Rab3A complex, and its expression is altered in mouse and human proteinuric disease. Furthermore, we previously identified a polymorphism that suggested a role for RPH3A protein in the development of urinary albumin excretion. Since endocytosis and vesicle trafficking are fundamental pathways for nephrocytes, the objective here is to assess the role of the RPH3A ortholog in Drosophila, Rabphilin (Rph), in the structure and function of nephrocytes. We have confirmed that Rph is required for the endocytic pathway to function correctly in pericardial Drosophila nephrocytes. Knockdown of Rph reduces the expression of cubilin and stick and stones genes, which encode proteins that are involved in protein uptake and filtration. We also found that reduced Rph expression results in a disappearance of the labyrinthine channel structure and a reduction in the number of endosomes, which ultimately leads to changes in the number and volume of nephrocytes. Finally, we described that administration of retinoic acid to IR-Rph nephrocytes rescued some altered aspects as the filtration and molecular uptake as well as the maintenance of cell fate. According to our data, Rph is crucial for the nephrocyte's filtration and reabsorption and it is required for the maintenance of the nephrocyte's ultrastructure, integrity, and differentiation.","Selma-Soriano, Estela; Llamusi, Beatriz; Fernández-Costa, Juan Manuel; Ozimski, Lauren Louise; Artero, Rubén; Redón, Josep",Dis. model. mech.

This includes protecting pitch-side medical staff and players from infection. The ongoing prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and the desire to resume professional sport required urgent best practice guidelines to be developed so that sport could be resumed as safely as possible. This set of best practice recommendations assembles early evidence for managing SARS-CoV-2 and integrates expert opinion to provide a uniform and pragmatic approach to enhance on-field and pitch-side safety for the clinician and player.

In addition, we need to develop tools that can measure/monitor T-cell and B-cell responses to know how our immune system is responding to this deleterious virus. However, little information is currently available about the immune target epitopes of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) to induce host immune responses. Through a comprehensive bioinformatic screening of potential epitopes derived from the SARS-CoV-2 sequences for HLAs commonly present in the Japanese population, we identified 2013 and 1399 possible peptide epitopes that are likely to have the high affinity (<0.5%- and 2%-rank, respectively) to HLA class I and II molecules, respectively, that may induce CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses. These epitopes distributed across the structural (spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins) and the nonstructural proteins (proteins corresponding to six open reading frames); however, we found several regions where high-affinity epitopes were significantly enriched. By comparing the sequences of these predicted T cell epitopes to the other coronaviruses, we identified 781 HLA-class I and 418 HLA-class II epitopes that have high homologies to SARS-CoV. To further select commonly-available epitopes that would be applicable to larger populations, we calculated population coverages based on the allele frequencies of HLA molecules, and found 2 HLA-class I epitopes covering 83.8% of the Japanese population. The findings in the current study provide us valuable information to design widely-available vaccine epitopes against SARS-CoV-2 and also provide the useful information for monitoring T-cell responses.","Kiyotani, Kazuma; Toyoshima, Yujiro; Nemoto, Kensaku; Nakamura, Yusuke",J Hum Genet,331,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using Twitter search features, all tweets containing keywords from both ""radiology"" and ""COVID-19"" were collected for the period January 01, 2020 up to April 24, 2020. The resulting dataset comprised of 8354 tweets. Images were classified as (i) images with text (ii) radiological content (e.g., CT scan snapshots, X-ray images), and (iii) non-medical content like personal images or memes. We trained our deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on training dataset of 1040 labeled images drawn from all three classes. We then trained another DL classifier for segmenting images into categories based on human anatomy. All software used is open-source and adapted for this research. The diagnostic performance of the algorithm was assessed by comparing results on a test set of 1885 images. RESULTS: Our analysis shows that in COVID-19 related tweets on radiology, nearly 32% had textual images, another 24% had radiological content, and 44% were not of radiological significance. Our results indicated a 92% accuracy in classifying images originally labeled as chest X-ray or chest CT and a nearly 99% accurate classification of images containing medically relevant text.

Worldwide people have had to manage the experience of an uncertain new threat under very different conditions. A growing body of research and theoretical approaches tries to make sense of the social responses to the pandemic. This monograph issue contributes to the research on the first wave of the pandemic from the perspective of the sociology of risk and uncertainty. This includes a number of key topics such as care workers? experiences in the Netherlands, stigmatisation and Othering in India, the multidimensionality of social inequalities in the experience of confinement in Argentina, mourning practices in Iran, discourses of legitimacy in Sweden, distrust in government in Hong Kong, risk communication in the UK, and fake news in social media. This introduction sets these contributions in the broader context of key debates in the sociology of risk and uncertainty such as rational, in-between and non-rational approaches to risk in everyday life, the Othering of social groups, the multidimensionality of risk and inequality, the debate about methodological cosmopolitanism, the discursive construction of legitimacy, the significance of (dis)trust for public engagement with risk, shortcomings in risk communication, and framing of fake news and conspiracy theories. The monograph concludes with reflections on perspectives for social learning, the importance of the society?nature?technology nexus for the understanding of the crisis, and finally, with envisioning possible pathways towards a new normal.","Zinn, Jens O.",Current Sociology,331,1

It has been declared as a public health emergency of international concern by WHO in a very short span of time. The community transmission of this highly infectious virus has severely affected various parts of China, Italy, Spain, India, and USA, among others. The prophylactic solution against SARS-CoV-2 infection is challenging due to the high mutation rate of its RNA genome. Herein, we exploited a next-generation vaccinology approach to construct a multi-epitope vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 that is predicted to have high antigenicity, safety, and efficacy to combat this deadly infectious agent. The whole proteome was scrutinized for the screening of highly conserved, antigenic, non-allergen, and non-toxic epitopes having high population coverage that can elicit both humoral and cellular mediated immune response against COVID-19 infection. These epitopes along with four different adjuvants, were utilized to construct a multi-epitope-vaccine candidate that can generate strong immunological memory response having high efficacy in humans. Various physiochemical analyses revealed the formation of a stable vaccine product having a high propensity to form a protective solution against the detrimental SARS-CoV-2 strain with high efficacy. The vaccine candidate interacted with immunological receptor TLR3 with a high affinity depicting the generation of innate immunity. Further, the codon optimization and in silico expression show the plausibility of the high expression and easy purification of the vaccine product. Thus, this present study provides an initial platform for the rapid generation of an efficacious protective vaccine for combating COVID-19.","Jain, Neha; Shankar, Uma; Majee, Prativa; Kumar, Amit",Infect Genet Evol,331,24

The objective of this study was to determine its placental transfer. METHODS: Maternal-to-fetal transfer was investigated using the open-circuit ex vivo dually perfused human cotyledon model. Doravirine was added to a maternal perfusate (theoretical doravirine concentration of 250 ng/mL) containing 2 g/L human albumin and 20 g/L antipyrine, a marker to validate the cotyledon's viability, and cotyledons were dually perfused for up to 90 min. RESULTS: In five experiments, the median (IQR) doravirine concentrations in the maternal and fetal compartments were, respectively, 303 (178-420) and 40 (30-54) ng/mL, the fetal-to-maternal ratio was 16% (12%-18%) and the clearance index (in comparison with antipyrine transfer) was 48% (35%-64%). The median accumulation index in cotyledon tissue was 39% (range 10%-66%). CONCLUSIONS: Doravirine both crosses and accumulates in the placenta. This may be useful as pre/post-exposure prophylaxis to reduce the risk of vertical HIV transmission but carries the potential for fetal toxicities. Further investigation is required to determine the safety and efficacy of this new antiretroviral agent in pregnancy.","Lê, Minh Patrick; Pencolé, Lucile; Peytavin, Gilles; Bouchet-Crivat, Florian; Mandelbrot, Laurent",J. antimicrob. chemother,331,16

Practicing hand hygiene using alcohol-based handrub or soap and water reduces harmful organisms. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) best practice recommends empowering patients with hand hygiene knowledge and engaging their involvement to strengthen hand hygiene practices. AIMS: The aim of this project was to improve hand hygiene among surgical inpatients. METHODS: This evidence-based quality improvement project was conducted in three phases: the baseline audit, implementing best practice, and the postimplementation audit. Participants were patients hospitalized in three surgical wards of a 1200-bed acute care tertiary hospital. This project utilized the online JBI Practical Application of Clinical Evidence System and The Getting Research into Practice program to identify barriers and strategies. Nurses provided patients with an education pamphlet and regularly reminded them to improve their hand hygiene practices. RESULTS: Ninety-four patients were audited between April and June 2018. Patients' hand hygiene practices improved from 19.1% at baseline audit to 61.7% (Pâ<â0.01) at first follow-up audit. Patients' hand hygiene improved from 48.9 to 72.3% (Pâ=â0.03) before meals, and from 92.6 to 98.9% (Pâ=â0.65) after toileting. The proportion of patients who received a hand hygiene information leaflet in an appropriate language increased from 64.9 to 89.4% (Pâ<â0.01). CONCLUSION: Patients' involvement in the hand hygiene program has significantly improved their hand hygiene practices. Patient education and patient information leaflet continue to be an effective strategy to improve knowledge and practices.","Choong, Tze Lin; Lim, Zhao Jun; Ho, Alexander Guan Ting; Goh, Mien Li",,331,15

Even though protective vaccines are starting to be administered, an effective antiviral agent for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 is not available yet. Moreover, since new and deadly CoVs can emerge at any time with the potential of becoming pandemics, the development of therapeutic agents against potentially deadly CoVs is a research area of much current interest. In the search for anti-coronaviral drugs, researchers soon turned their heads towards glycosylated flavonoids. Glycosyl flavonoids, widespread in the plant kingdom, have received a lot of attention due to their widely recognized antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, anticarcinogenic, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, and antiviral properties together with their capacity to modulate key cellular functions. The wide range of biological activities displayed by glycosyl flavonoids, along with their low toxicity, make them ideal candidates for drug development.

We aimed to identify high-risk occupations for early coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) local transmission. METHODS: In this observational study, we extracted confirmed COVID-19 cases from governmental investigation reports in Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. We followed each country/area for 40 days after its first locally transmitted case, and excluded all imported cases. We defined a possible work-related case as a worker with evidence of close contact with another confirmed case due to work, or an unknown contact history but likely to be infected in the working environment (e.g. an airport taxi driver). We calculated the case number for each occupation, and illustrated the temporal distribution of all possible work-related cases and healthcare worker (HCW) cases. The temporal distribution was further defined as early outbreak (the earliest 10 days of the following period) and late outbreak (11th to 40th days of the following period). RESULTS: We identified 103 possible work-related cases (14.9%) among a total of 690 local transmissions. The five occupation groups with the most cases were healthcare workers (HCWs) (22%), drivers and transport workers (18%), services and sales workers (18%), cleaning and domestic workers (9%) and public safety workers (7%). Possible work-related transmission played a substantial role in early outbreak (47.7% of early cases). Occupations at risk varied from early outbreak (predominantly services and sales workers, drivers, construction laborers, and religious professionals) to late outbreak (predominantly HCWs, drivers, cleaning and domestic workers, police officers, and religious professionals). CONCLUSIONS: Work-related transmission is considerable in early COVID-19 outbreaks, and the elevated risk of infection was not limited to HCW. Implementing preventive/surveillance strategies for high-risk working populations is warranted.","Lan, Fan-Yun; Wei, Chih-Fu; Hsu, Yu-Tien; Christiani, David C; Kales, Stefanos N",PLoS One,331,32

Medicare innovations have been adopted or adapted in Medicaid and by private payers, while Medicare Advantage plans successfully compete with TM only because their payment rates are tied by regulation to those in the traditional Medicare program. However, Medicare has not succeeded in implementing new, value-based payment approaches that also would serve as models for other payers, nor has Medicare succeeded in improving quality by relying on public reporting of measured performance. It is increasingly clear that burdensome attention to measurement and reporting distracts from what could be successful efforts to actually improve care through quality improvement programs, with Medicare leading in partnership with providers, other payers, and patients. Although Congress is unlikely to adopt candidate Biden's proposals to decrease the eligibility age for Medicare or adopt a public option based on Medicare prices and payment methods in the marketplaces, the incoming Biden administration has an opportunity to provide overdue, strategic direction to the pursuit of value-based payments and to replace failed pay-for-performance with provider-managed projects to improve quality and reduce health disparities.","Berenson, Robert",J. health polit. policy law,331,16

Because most electron microscopists in pathology are not accustomed to analysing viral particles and subcellular structures, our review aims to discuss the ultrastructural changes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 with respect to pathology, virology, and electron microscopy. Using micrographs from infected cell cultures and autopsy tissues, we show how coronavirus replication affects ultrastructure and put the morphological findings in the context of viral replication, which induces extensive remodelling of the intracellular membrane systems. Virions assemble by budding into the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate complex and are characterized by electron dense dots of cross-sections of the nucleocapsid inside the viral particles. Physiological mimickers such as multivesicular bodies or coated vesicles serve as perfect decoys. Compared to other in-situ techniques, transmission electron microscopy is the only method to visualize assembled virions in tissues and will be required to prove SARS-CoV-2 replication outside the respiratory tract. In practice, documenting in tissues the characteristic features seen in infected cell cultures, seems to be much more difficult than anticipated.

This was 1.450 (1.441, 1.460) for Maharashtra, 1.444 (1.430, 1.460) for Gujarat, 1.297 (1.284, 1.310) for Delhi and 1.405 (1.389, 1.421) for Tamil Nadu. In India, the R at the first week from March 2-8, 2020 was 3.2. It remained around 2 units for three weeks, from March 9-29, 2020. After March 2020, it started declining and reached around 1.3 in the following week suggesting a stabilisation of the transmissibility rate. Conclusion: The study estimated a baseline R0 of 1.379 for India. It also showed that the R was getting stabilised from first week of April (with an average R of 1.29), despite the increase in March. This suggested that in due course there will be a reversal of epidemic. However, these analyses should be revised periodically.","Marimuthu, S; Joy, Melvin; Malavika, B; Nadaraj, Ambily; Asirvatham, Edwin Sam; Jeyaseelan, L",,331,16

The emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has become a global issue with raising dire concerns. Patients with severe Covid-19 may progress toward ARDS. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be derived from bone marrow, umbilical cord, adipose tissue and so on. The easy accessibility and low immunogenicity enable MSCs for allogeneic administration, and thus they were widely used in animal and clinical studies. Accumulating evidence suggests that mesenchymal stem cell infusion can ameliorate ARDS. However, the underlying mechanisms of MSCs need to be discussed. Recent studies showed MSCs can modulate immune/inflammatory cells, attenuate endoplasmic reticulum stress, and inhibit pulmonary fibrosis. The paracrine cytokines and exosomes may account for these beneficial effects. In this review, we summarize the therapeutic mechanisms of MSCs in ARDS, analyzed the most recent animal experiments and Covid-19 clinical trial results, discussed the adverse effects and prospects in the recent studies, and highlight the potential roles of MSC therapy for Covid-19 patients with ARDS.","Wang, Wendi; Lei, Wei; Jiang, Lina; Gao, Siqi; Hu, Shijun; Zhao, Zi-Gang; Niu, Chun-Yu; Zhao, Zhen-Ao",J Transl Med,331,16

The epidemiological situation of national importance required infection control measures with the aim of reducing morbidity and mortality. An overburdening of the healthcare system should be avoided. The measures taken to combat the pandemic have had an impact on public and private life. Patients suffering from chronic pain have also been greatly affected. QUESTION: Which impact on their care do patients with chronic pain experience? METHOD: After multimodal inpatient treatment 70 pain patients were interviewed by telephone in a standardized fashion. They were asked about their condition as follows: did the changes due to the pandemic result in an increase in pain levels, a deterioration in mood and did the pandemic have a negative impact on the supply of pain medication? RESULTS: Changes in the biopsychosocial area were experienced by the patients and affected their overall well-being. Chronically ill pain patients were particularly affected by the lockdown. A large number of patients associated a deterioration in mood and aggravation of the chronic pain with measures resulting from the pandemic. The mood deterioration was clearly associated (70% of respondents). An increase in pain was associated with changes caused by the pandemic in 44% of respondents. Of the patients 39% reported a deterioration of the pain management. The measures taken to combat the pandemic have had and still have an impact on the lives of chronically ill pain patients. DISCUSSION: It is necessary to maintain the limited but still existing options of coordinated care for pain patients following a multimodal inpatient stay, even in difficult situations. The negative effects of a reduction in medical care are an argument in favor of multimodal outpatient care, especially after inpatient treatment.","Cegla, Thomas H; Magner, Astrid",Schmerz,331,1

In PBL students first encounter a problem, which triggers discussion, followed by student-centred inquiry. Makerere University College of Health Sciences has been using PBL for radiography students since 2002. Over the years, the learning landscape may have changed, including the significant disruption of learning by the coronavirus disease 2019 global pandemic. The study aimed at exploring the perceptions of undergraduate radiography students about the PBL curriculum at Makerere University almost two decades after its introduction. METHODS: This exploratory qualitative study involved 18 radiography students sampled purposively, from whom data were gathered using focus group discussions. Thematic analysis was subsequently used. RESULTS: Three key themes emerged from the data: (1) quality of teaching, (2) curriculum efficiency, and (3) curriculum expectations and rating. All students were generally positive about the curriculum. Most agreed that the curriculum was efficient to a greater extent and had met their expectations and desired objectives. Students, however, faced challenges; for example, with limited learning resources during the learning process. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the significant role of PBL in enhancing student's problem-solving, critical thinking, literature search, and, most of all, their practical skills. Prioritization of teaching based on practical relevance and learning objectives is of great importance. The radiography students believed that their curriculum program was generally beneficial to them; however, it was affected by limited resources and limited availability of teaching personnel, which needs to be addressed.","Mpalanyi, Moses; Nalweyiso, Irene Dorothy; Mubuuke, Aloysius Gonzaga",Journal of medical imaging and radiation sciences (Online),331,20

In our patient, there was both a right atrial ""clot in transit"" from his DVT as well as extensive muralized biventricular thrombus from severe global hypokinesis. We believe that the hypercoagulable state of his COVID-19 infection, along with severe systolic dysfunction, caused this unusual presentation. Although the hypercoagulable state of COVID-19 is well recognized, there have not been any reported cases of extensive de-novo intracardiac thrombus as of yet.

Methodology: The diagnostic validity, safety, and reliability of LA and LUS were analyzed in patients admitted in a pulmonary ward due to decompensated obstructive airway diseases, decompensated interstitial diseases, and pulmonary infections, in a prospective study. Standard formulas were used to calculate the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. The interobserver agreement with respect to the LA and LUS findings was evaluated based on the Kappa coefficient (ᴋ). Results: A total of 115 patients were studied. LUS was more sensitive than the LA in evaluating pulmonary infections (93.59% vs. 77.02%;p = 0.001) and more specifically in the case of decompensated obstructive airway diseases (95.6% vs. 19.10%;p = 0.001). The diagnostic accuracy of LUS was also greater in the case of pulmonary infections (75.65% vs. 60.90%;p = 0.02). The sensitivity and specificity of the combination of LA and LUS was 95.95%, 50% in pulmonary infections, 76.19%, 100% in case of decompensated obstructive airway diseases, and (100%, 88.54%) in case of interstitial diseases.

Early risk stratification for the need of ECMO therapy upon admission to the hospital using artificial intelligence (AI)-based computed tomography (CT) assessment and clinical scores is beneficial for patient assessment and resource management;(2) Methods: Retrospective single-center study with 95 confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to the participating ICUs. Patients requiring ECMO therapy (n = 14) during ICU stay versus patients without ECMO treatment (n = 81) were evaluated for discriminative clinical prediction parameters and AI-based CT imaging features and their diagnostic potential to predict ECMO therapy. Reported patient data include clinical scores, AI-based CT findings and patient outcomes;(3) Results: Patients subsequently allocated to ECMO therapy had significantly higher sequential organ failure (SOFA) scores (p &lt;0.001) and significantly lower oxygenation indices on admission (p = 0.009) than patients with standard ICU therapy. The median time from hospital admission to ECMO placement was 1.4 days (IQR 0.2–4.0). The percentage of lung involvement on AI-based CT assessment on admission to the hospital was significantly higher in ECMO patients (p &lt;0.001). In binary logistic regression analyses for ECMO prediction including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), SOFA score on admission, lactate on admission and percentage of lung involvement on admission CTs, only SOFA score (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.08–1.62) and lung involvement (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01–1.11) were significantly associated with subsequent ECMO allocation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 (95% CI 0.73–0.94) for lung involvement on admission CT and 0.82 (95% CI 0.72–0.91) for SOFA scores on ICU admission. A combined parameter of SOFA on ICU admission and lung involvement on admission CT yielded an AUC of 0.91 (0.84–0.97) with a sensitivity of 0.93 and a specificity of 0.84 for ECMO prediction;(4) Conclusions: AI-based assessment of lung involvement on CT scans on admission to the hospital and SOFA scoring, especially if combined, can be used as risk stratification tools for subsequent requirement for ECMO therapy in patients with severe COVID-19 disease to improve resource management in ICU settings.","Gresser, Eva Reich Jakob Sabel Bastian O.; Kunz, Wolfgang G.; Fabritius, Matthias P.; Rübenthaler, Johannes Ingrisch Michael Wassilowsky Dietmar Irlbeck Michael Ricke Jens Puhr-Westerheide Daniel",Diagnostics,331,18

Although loneliness has been revealed to play an important role in psychological health and well-being, little is known about moderating and mitigating mechanisms underlying this association, especially during adverse experiences (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic). The current study purposed to explore whether subjective vitality mediated the association of loneliness with psychological adjustment and whether college belongingness moderated the mediating effect of subjective vitality on students' adjustment in the context of loneliness. The study sample comprised 333 undergraduate students (69% female) from a public university in Turkey. They ranged in age between 19 and 41 years (M= 21.94, SD= 4.15). Findings from mediation analysis revealed that loneliness had a significant predictive effect on subjective vitality and psychological adjustment challenges. Subjective vitality also mediated the effect of loneliness on the psychological adjustment of college students. Further, college belongingness moderated the mediating effect of subjective vitality on adjustment and had a protective effect on the association between loneliness and subjective vitality in college students. These results indicate that subjective vitality and college belongingness are important mechanisms that may help develop prevention and intervention strategies to foster students' psychological health and well-being in university settings. © 2021 Institute of Image Electronics Engineers of Japan.

Public and private decision-making surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic must contend with uncertainty about the probability of infection during activities involving groups of people, in order to decide whether that activity is worth undertaking. We propose a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection probability that can produce estimates of relative risk of infection for diverse activities, so long as those activities meet a list of assumptions, including that they do not last longer than one day (e.g., sporting events, flights, concerts), and that the probability of infection among possible routes of infection (i.e., droplet, aerosol, fomite, and direct contact) are independent. We show how the model can be used to inform decisions facing governments and industry, such as opening stadiums or flying on airplanes; in particular, it allows for estimating the ranking of the constituent components of activities (e.g., going through a turnstile, sitting in one's seat) by their relative risk of infection, even when the probability of infection is unknown or uncertain. We prove that the model is a good approximation of a more refined model in which we assume infections come from a series of independent risks. A linearity assumption governing several potentially modifiable risks factors-such as duration of the activity, density of participants, and infectiousness of the attendees-makes interpreting and using the model straightforward, and we argue that it does so without significantly diminishing the reliability of the model.","McCarthy, John E; Dewitt, Barry D; Dumas, Bob A; McCarthy, Myles T",PLoS One,331,22

DAD is characterized by an acute phase with edema, hyaline membranes, and inflammation followed by an organizing phase with pulmonary fibrosis and hyperplasia. The degree of pulmonary fibrosis and surface tension is different in the pathological stages of DAD. The effects of pulmonary fibrosis and surface tension on alveolar sac mechanics in DAD are investigated by using the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) method. The human pulmonary alveolus is idealized by a three-dimensional honeycomb-like geometry, with alveolar geometries approximated as closely packed 14-sided polygons. A dynamic compression-relaxation model for surface tension effects is adopted. Compared to a healthy model, DAD models are created by increasing the tissue thickness and decreasing the concentration of the surfactant. The FSI results show that pulmonary fibrosis is more influential than the surface tension on flow rate, volume, P-V loop, and resistance. The lungs of the disease models become stiffer than those of the healthy models. According to the P-V loop results, the surface tension plays a more important role in hysteresis than the material nonlinearity of the lung tissue. Our study demonstrates the differences in air flow and lung function on the alveolar sacs between the healthy and DAD models.","Chen, Long; Tao, Weiwei; Ji, Wei; Lu, Yan; Zhao, Xia",J. biomech. eng,331,10

As a disease begins to spread in the population, information about the disease is transmitted to others, which in turn has an effect on the spread of disease. In this paper, using empirical results of the propagation of H7N9 and information about the disease, we clearly show that the spreading dynamics of the two-types of processes influence each other. We build a mathematical model in which both types of spreading dynamics are described using the SIS process in order to illustrate the influence of information diffusion on epidemic spreading. Both the simulation results and the pairwise analysis reveal that information diffusion can increase the threshold of an epidemic outbreak, decrease the final fraction of infected individuals and significantly decrease the rate at which the epidemic propagates. Additionally, we find that the multi-outbreak phenomena of epidemic spreading, along with the impact of information diffusion, is consistent with the empirical results. These findings highlight the requirement to maintain social awareness of diseases even when the epidemics seem to be under control in order to prevent a subsequent outbreak. These results may shed light on the in-depth understanding of the interplay between the dynamics of epidemic spreading and information diffusion.","Zhan, Xiu-Xiu; Liu, Chuang; Zhou, Ge; Zhang, Zi-Ke; Sun, Gui-Quan; Zhu, Jonathan J.

Ciclesonide (CIC) is a sGC prodrug approved for asthma treatment that exhibits limited systemic side effects. Carboxylesterases enriched in the lower airways convert CIC to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonist des-CIC. We therefore examined whether CIC would likewise activate GR in neonatal lung but have limited adverse extra-pulmonary effects, particularly in the developing brain. Neonatal rats were administered subcutaneous injections of CIC, DEX or vehicle from postnatal days 1-5 (PND1-PND5). Systemic effects linked to DEX exposure, including reduced body and brain weight, were not observed in CIC treated neonates. Furthermore, CIC did not trigger the long-lasting reduction in myelin basic protein expression in the cerebral cortex nor cerebellar size caused by neonatal DEX exposure. Conversely, DEX and CIC were both effective at inducing the expression of select GR target genes in neonatal lung, including those implicated in lung-protective and anti-inflammatory effects. Thus, CIC is a promising, novel candidate drug to treat or prevent BPD in neonates given its activation of GR in neonatal lung and limited adverse neurodevelopmental effects. Furthermore, since sGCs such as DEX administered to pregnant women in pre-term labor can adversely affect fetal brain development, the neurological-sparing properties of CIC, make it an attractive alternative for DEX to treat pregnant women severely ill with respiratory illness, such as with asthma exacerbations or COVID-19 infections.","Jaumotte, Juliann D; Franks, Alexis L; Bargerstock, Erin M; Kisanga, Edwina Philip; Menden, Heather L; Ghersi, Alexis; Omar, Mahmoud; Wang, Liping; Rudine, Anthony; Short, Kelly L; Silswal, Neerupama; Cole, Timothy J; Sampath, Venkatesh; Monaghan-Nichols, A Paula; DeFranco, Donald B",Neurobiol Dis,331,21

Our analysis leveraged age-specific COVID-19 mortality and laboratory testing from a large COVID-19 registry, along with epidemiological data of [~]3.4 million individuals, large-scale deep immune cell profiling data, and single-cell RNA-sequencing data from aged COVID-19 patients across diverse populations.

Methods: We analyzed data from COVID-19 Outcomes Registry (CURATOR) at Houston Methodist. All adult (≥ 18 years) patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal specimens were included. Utilizing ICD-10 diagnoses codes, we classified PEND patients as those with documented history of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, transient ischemic attack, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease and related dementias including vascular dementia, primary and metastatic brain tumors, epilepsy, motor neuron disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury. Logistic regression models were fitted to assess the odds of COVID-19 mortality associated with PEND. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) are reported. Results: Between March 3 and August 10, 2020, 86,614 individuals were tested for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 14,233 (16.4%) tested positive, with 4,473 (31.4%) hospitalizations, and 431 (9.6%) deaths. Overall 11,473 (13.2%) individuals had PEND, of whom 1,458 (12.7%) tested positive, 966 (66.3%) were hospitalized and 165 (17.1%) died. Among positive cases, PEND (vs. non-PEND) patients were older (67.1 vs. 46.4 years) and had a higher overall comorbidity burden (median Charlson Comorbidity Index: 6 vs. 1). The proportion of PEND patients was significantly higher among COVID-19 patients who died (vs. those who were discharged alive) (38.3% vs. 19.8%, crude OR, CI: 2.51, 2.03 - 3.09).

These tools can help reduce the risk of exposing patients and medical staff to infection, make healthcare services more accessible, and allow providers to see more patients. However, objective measurement of vital signs is challenging without direct contact with a patient. We present a video-based and on-device optical cardiopulmonary vital sign measurement approach. It leverages a novel multi-task temporal shift convolutional attention network (MTTS-CAN) and enables real-time cardiovascular and respiratory measurements on mobile platforms. We evaluate our system on an ARM CPU and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy while running at over 150 frames per second which enables real-time applications. Systematic experimentation on large benchmark datasets reveals that our approach leads to substantial (20%-50%) reductions in error and generalizes well across datasets.","Liu, Xin; Fromm, Josh; Patel, Shwetak; McDuff, Daniel",,331,1

Materials and methods: Data of patients hospitalized from 18 March 2020 to 20 April 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Two scores for the screening of coagulopathy (SIC and non-overt DIC scores) were calculated. The occurrence of thrombotic complication, death, and worsening respiratory function requiring non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or admission to ICU were recorded, and these outcomes were correlated with the results of each score. Chi-square test, receiver-operating characteristic curve, and logistic regression analysis were used as appropriate. p Values &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: Data of 32 patients were analyzed. Overt-DIC was diagnosed in two patients (6.2%), while 26 (81.2%) met the criteria for non-overt DIC. Non-overt DIC score values ≥4 significantly correlated with the need of NIV/ICU (p = 0.02) and with the occurrence of thrombotic complications (p = 0.04). A score ≥4 was the optimal cut-off value, performing better than SIC score (p = 0.0018). Values ≥4 in patients with thrombotic complications were predictive of death (p = 0.03). Conclusions: Overt DIC occurred in 6.2% of non-ICU patients hospitalized for a mild to moderate COVID-19 respiratory distress, while 81.2% fulfilled the criteria for non-overt DIC. The non-overt DIC score performed better than the SIC score in predicting the need of NIV/ICU and the occurrence of thrombotic complications, as well as in predicting mortality in patients with thrombotic complications, with a score ≥4 being detected as the optimal cut-off.","Mazzaccaro, Daniela; Giacomazzi, Francesca; Giannetta, Matteo; Varriale, Alberto; Scaramuzzo, Rosa; Modafferi, Alfredo; Malacrida, Giovanni; Righini, Paolo; Marrocco-Trischitta, Massimiliano M.; Nano, Giovanni",J.

The long duration of pathological laboratory tests and the suspicious test results led the researchers to focus on different fields. Fast and accurate diagnoses are essential for effective interventions for COVID-19. The information obtained by using X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) images is vital in making clinical diagnoses. Therefore it is aimed to develop a machine learning method for the detection of viral epidemics by analyzing X-ray and CT images. In this study, images belonging to six situations, including coronavirus images, are classified using a two-stage data enhancement approach. Since the number of images in the dataset is deficient and unbalanced, a shallow image augmentation approach was used in the first phase. It is more convenient to analyze these images with hand-crafted feature extraction methods because the dataset newly created is still insufficient to train a deep architecture. Therefore, the Synthetic minority over-sampling technique algorithm is the second data enhancement step of this study. Finally, the feature vector is reduced in size by using a stacked auto-encoder and principal component analysis methods to remove interconnected features in the feature vector. According to the obtained results, it is seen that the proposed method has leveraging performance, especially to make the diagnosis of COVID-19 in a short time and effectively. Also, it is thought to be a source of inspiration for future studies for deficient and unbalanced datasets.","Öztürk, Saban; Özkaya, Umut; Barstugan, Mücahid",,331,1

It has resulted in great health and economic costs because no effective treatment is currently available. Since infected persons vary in presentation from healthy asymptomatic mild symptoms to those who need intensive care support and eventually succumb to the disease, this illness is considered to depend primarily on individual immunity. Demographic distribution and disease severity in several regions of the world vary; therefore, it is believed that natural inherent immunity provided through dietary sources and traditional medicines could play an important role in infection prevention and disease progression. People can boost their immunity to prevent them from infection after COVID-19 exposure and can reduce their inflammatory reactions to protect their organ deterioration in case suffering from the disease. Some drugs with in-situ immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activity are also identified as adjunctive therapy in the COVID-19 era. This review discusses the importance of COVID-19 interactions with immune cells and inflammatory cells; and further emphasizes the possible pathways related with traditional herbs, medications and nutritional products. We believe that such pathophysiological pathway approach treatment is rational and important for future development of new therapeutic agents for prevention or cure of COVID-19 infection.","Ho, Ping; Zheng, Jing-Quan; Wu, Chia-Chao; Hou, Yi-Chou; Liu, Wen-Chih; Lu, Chien-Lin; Zheng, Cai-Mei; Lu, Kuo-Cheng; Chao, You-Chen",Int J Med Sci,331,16

PURPOSE: To describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of a pharmacy clinical decision support tool designed to increase naloxone coprescription among people at risk for opioid overdose in a large healthcare system. SUMMARY: The Military Health System Opioid Registry and underlying presentation layer were used to develop a clinical decision support capability to improve naloxone coprescription at the pharmacy point of care. Pharmacy personnel use a patient identification card barcode scanner or manually enter a patient's identification number to quickly visualize information on a patient's risk for opioid overdose and medical history related to pain and, when appropriate, receive a recommendation to coprescribe naloxone. The tool was made available to military treatment facility pharmacy locations. An interactive dashboard was developed to support monitoring, utilization, and impact on naloxone coprescription to patients at risk for opioid overdose. CONCLUSION: Initial implementation of the naloxone tool was slow from a lack of end-user awareness. Efforts to increase utilization were, in part, successful owing to a number of enterprise-wide educational initiatives. In early 2020, the naloxone tool was used in 15% of all opioid prescriptions dispensed at a military pharmacy. Data indicate that the frequency of naloxone coprescription to patients at risk for opioid overdose was significantly higher when the naloxone tool was used than when the tool was not used.","Rittel, Alexander; Highland, Krista; Maneval, Mark S; Bockhorst, Archie; Moreno, Agustin; Sim, Alan; Easter, Peter; Nichols, Chris; Costantino, Ryan C",Am. j. health system pharm,331,3

Our study aims to describe the characteristics and therapeutic emergency mobile service (EMS) management of patients with vital distress due to COVID-19, their in-hospital care pathway and their in-hospital outcome. METHODS: This retrospective and multicentric study was conducted in the six main centers of the French Greater East region, an area heavily impacted by the pandemic. All patients requiring EMS dispatch and who were admitted straight to the intensive care unit (ICU) were included. Clinical data from their pre-hospital and hospital management were retrieved. RESULTS: We included a total of 103 patients (78.6% male, median age 68). In the initial stage, patients were in a critical condition (median oxygen saturation was 72% (60-80%)). In the field, 77.7% (CI 95%: 71.8-88.3%) were intubated. Almost half of our population (45.6%, CI 95%: 37.1-56.9%) had clinical Phenotype 1 (silent hypoxemia), while the remaining half presented Phenotype 2 (acute respiratory failure). In the ICU, a great number had ARDS (77.7%, CI 95% 71.8-88.3% with a PaO2/FiO2 < 200). In-hospital mortality was 33% (CI 95%: 24.6-43.3%). The two phenotypes showed clinical and radiological differences (respiratory rate, OR = 0.98, p = 0.02; CT scan lesion extension >50%, OR = 0.76, p < 0.03). However, no difference was found in terms of overall in-hospital mortality (OR = 1.07, p = 0.74). CONCLUSION: The clinical phenotypes appear to be very distinguishable in the pre-hospital field, yet no difference was found in terms of mortality. This leads us to recommend an identical management in the initial phase, despite the two distinct presentations.","Le Borgne, Pierrick; Oberlin, Mathieu; Bassand, Adrien; Abensur Vuillaume, Laure; Gottwalles, Yannick; Noizet, Marc; Gennai, Stéphane; Baicry, Florent; Jaeger, Deborah; Girerd, Nicolas; Lefebvre, François; Bilbault, Pascal; Chouihed, Tahar",,331,1

We also consider how information may be false, but true after accounting for the lack of expertise of the source. This is relevant for modelling situations in which information sources make claims beyond their domain of expertise. We use non-standard semantics for the language based on an expertise set with certain closure properties. It turns out there is a close connection between our semantics and S5 epistemic logic, so that expertise can be expressed in terms of knowledge at all possible states.

Here, we show that human SARS-CoV (huSARS-CoV) originated directly from bats, rather than civets, by a cross-species jump in 1991, and formed a human-adapted strain in 1998. Since then huSARS-CoV has evolved further into highly virulent strains with genotype T and a 29-nt deletion mutation, and weakly virulent strains with genotype C but without the 29-nt deletion. The former can cause pneumonia in humans and could be the major causative pathogen of the SARS outbreak, whereas the latter might not cause pneumonia in humans, but evolved the ability to co-utilize civet ACE2 as an entry receptor, leading to interspecies transmission between humans and civets. Three crucial time points - 1991, for the cross-species jump from bats to humans; 1998, for the formation of the human-adapted SARS-CoV; and 2003, when there was an outbreak of SARS in humans - were found to associate with anomalously low annual precipitation and high temperatures in Guangdong. Anti-SARS-CoV sero-positivity was detected in 20% of all the samples tested from Guangzhou children who were born after 2005, suggesting that weakly virulent huSARS-CoVs might still exist in humans. These existing but undetected SARS-CoVs have a large potential to evolve into highly virulent strains when favorable climate conditions occur, highlighting a potential risk for the reemergence of SARS.","Tao, Ailin; Huang, Yuyi; Li, Peilu; Liu, Jun; Zhong, Nanshan; Zhang, Chiyu",,331,24

In statistics, power law distribution is often found to fit data exceptionally well when the normal (Gaussian) distribution fails. Nevertheless, predicting power law phenomena is notoriously difficult because some of its idiosyncratic properties such as lack of well-defined average value, and potentially unbounded variance. TPL (Taylor power law), a power law first discovered to characterize the spatial and/or temporal distribution of biological populations and recently extended to describe the spatiotemporal heterogeneities (distributions) of human microbiomes and other natural and artificial systems such as fitness distribution in computational (artificial) intelligence. The power law with exponential cutoff (PLEC) is a variant of power-law function that tapers off the exponential growth of power-law function ultimately and can be particularly useful for certain predictive problems such as biodiversity estimation and turning-point prediction for COVID-19 infection/fatality. Here, we propose coupling (integration) of TPL and PLEC to offer improved prediction quality of certain power-law phenomena. The coupling takes advantages of variance prediction using TPL and the asymptote estimation using PLEC and delivers confidence interval for the asymptote. We demonstrate the integrated approach to the estimation of potential (dark) biodiversity and turning point of COVID-19 fatality. We expect this integrative approach should have wide applications given the duel relationship between power law and normal statistical distributions.","Ma, Zhanshan",,331,24

The origin of SARS-CoV-2 has been related to the lineage B Betacoronavirus SARS-CoV and SARS-related coronaviruses found in bats. Early characterizations of the SARS-CoV-2 genome revealed the existence of a distinct four amino acid insert within the spike (S) protein (underlined, SPRRAR&#8595;S), at the S1/S2 site located at the interface between the S1 receptor binding subunit and the S2 fusion subunit. Notably, this insert appears to be a distinguishing feature among SARS-related sequences and introduces a potential cleavage site for the protease furin. Here, we investigate the potential role of this novel S1/S2 cleavage site and present direct biochemical evidence for proteolytic processing by a variety of proteases. We discuss these findings in the context of the origin of SARS-CoV-2, viral stability, and transmission.","Jaimes, Javier A; Millet, Jean K; Whittaker, Gary R",iScience,331,16

It is well‐known that these agents can prolong the QTc interval and potentially induce Torsades de Pointes (TdP). We aim to assess the prevalence and risk of QTc prolongation and arrhythmic events in COVID‐19 patients treated with these drugs.MethodsWe searched electronic databases from inception to September 30, 2020 for studies reporting peak QTc ≥500 ms, peak QTc change ≥60 ms, peak QTc interval, peak change of QTc interval, ventricular arrhythmias, TdP, sudden cardiac death, or atrioventricular block (AVB). All meta‐analyses were conducted using a random‐effects model.ResultsForty‐seven studies (three case series, 35 cohorts, and nine randomized controlled trials [RCTs]) involving 13 087 patients were included. The pooled prevalence of peak QTc ≥500 ms was 9% (95% confidence interval [95%CI], 3%–18%) and 8% (95%CI, 3%–14%) in patients who received hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin, respectively. Likewise, the use of hydroxychloroquine (risk ratio [RR], 2.68;95%CI, 1.56–4.60) and hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin (RR, 3.28;95%CI, 1.16–9.30) was associated with an increased risk of QTc prolongation compared to no treatment. Ventricular arrhythmias, TdP, sudden cardiac death, and AVB were reported in &lt;1% of patients across treatment groups. The only two studies that reported individual data of lopinavir/ritonavir found no cases of QTc prolongation.ConclusionsCOVID‐19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine with or without azithromycin had a relatively high prevalence and risk of QTc prolongation. However, the prevalence of arrhythmic events was very low, probably due to underreporting. The limited information about lopinavir/ritonavir showed that it does not prolong the QTc interval.","Carlos, Diaz‐Arocutipa Ana Brañez‐Condorena Hernandez Adrian V.",Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety,331,23

Investigating the case reports of acute stroke in COVID-19 patients, published since the beginning of the pandemic, we tried to trace the pathogenic mechanisms of stroke during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We conducted a systematic review analyzing demographic data, cerebrovascular risk factors, NIHSS score, vascular territory involvement and laboratory findings of 168 patients described in 89 studies, from a pool of 1243 records. Based on our results, we have identified different stroke profiles: (1) cerebral large vessel disease (CLVD) profile with a low disability, simultaneous onset of COVID-19 and stroke symptoms, good outcome and low serum levels of D-dimer and CRP; (2) intracranial bleeding (IB) profile with high disability, poor outcome and low levels of serum markers of inflammation and coagulopathy; (3) CLVD profile with a short time-lapse between COVID-19 symptoms and stroke onset, high neurological disability and very high systemic inflammatory markers; (4) multiple thrombo-embolic disease (MTED) profile with older patients, many comorbidities, disabling stroke, poor outcome, evident alteration of coagulation tests and high serum levels of both D-dimer and CRP. We therefore summarized these different profiles in a spectrum similar to that of visible light, where the violet-blue band included IB and CSVD with low inflammation and prothrombotic activity, the green-yellow band included CLVD with high inflammation and moderate prothrombotic activity and the orange-red band for MTED with moderate-high levels of inflammation and very high prothrombotic activity.","Frisullo, Giovanni; Scala, Irene; Bellavia, Simone; Broccolini, Aldobrando; Brunetti, Valerio; Morosetti, Roberta; Della Marca, Giacomo; Calabresi, Paolo",Rev. neurosci,331,1

All adult trauma care has been centralised to the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital for assessment and medical input, before transferring those requiring operative intervention to the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital. We aim to review the impact of COVID-19 on hip fracture workload and service changes upon management of hip fractures. Methods: We reviewed our prospectively maintained trust database and National Hip Fracture Database records for the months of March and April between the years 2016 and 2020. Our assessment included fracture pattern (intrascapular vs extracapsular hip fracture), treatment intervention, length of stay and mortality. Results: We treated 288 patients during March and April between 2016 and 2020, with a breakdown of 55, 58, 53, 68, and 54 from 2016 to 2020 respectively. Fracture pattern distribution in the pre-COVID-19 years of 2016 to 2019 was 58% intracapsular and 42% extracapsular. In 2020 (COVID-19 period) the fracture patterns were 65% intracapsular and 35% extracapsular. Our mean length of stay was 13.1 days (SD 8.2) between 2016 to 2019, and 5.0 days (6.3) days in 2020 (p < 0.001). Between 2016 and 2019 we had three deaths in hip fracture patients, and one death in 2020. Hemiarthroplasty and dynamic hip screw fixation have been the mainstay of operative intervention across the five years and this has continued in the COVID-19 period. We have experienced a rise in conservatively managed patients; ten in 2020 compared to 14 over the previous four years. Conclusion: There has not been a reduction in the number of hip fractures during COVID-19 period compared to the same time period over previous years. In our experience, there has been an increase in conservative treatment and decreased length of stay during the COVID -19 period.Cite this article: Bone Joint Open 2020;1-8:500-507.","Cheruvu, Manikandar Srinivas; Bhachu, Davinder Singh; Mulrain, Jill; Resool, Shko; Cool, Paul; Ford, David James; Singh, Rohit Amol",Bone Jt Open,331,22

METHODS: We analyzed COVID-19-positive patients who presented to the MedStar Health system (11 hospitals in Washington, DC, and Maryland) during the pandemic (March 1-September 30, 2020). We compared renal function and subsequent in-hospital clinical outcomes based on the presence or absence of troponin elevation. The primary outcome was the incidence of acute kidney injury in COVID-19 patients with troponin elevation. We also evaluated in-hospital mortality, overall and based on the presence and absence of both troponin elevation and renal dysfunction. RESULTS: The cohort included 3386 COVID-19-positive admitted patients for whom troponin was drawn. Of these patients, 195 had troponin elevation (defined as &#8805;1.0 ng/mL), mean age was 61 ± 16 years, and 51% were men. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher (53.8%) in COVID-19-positive patients with concomitant troponin elevation than in those without troponin elevation (14.5%; p < 0.001). COVID-19-positive patients with troponin elevation had a higher prevalence of renal dysfunction (58.5%) than those without troponin elevation (23.4%; p < 0.001). Further analysis demonstrated that having both troponin elevation and renal dysfunction carried the worst in-hospital prognosis (in-hospital mortality 57.9%; intensive-care-unit admission 76.8%; ventilation requirement 63.2%), as compared to the absence or presence of either. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with troponin elevation are at higher risk for worsening renal function, and these patients subsequently have worse in-hospital clinical outcomes. Efforts should focus on early recognition, evaluation, and intensifying care of these patients.","Case, Brian C; Yerasi, Charan; Forrestal, Brian J; Chezar-Azerrad, Chava; Shea, Corey; Rappaport, Hank; Medranda, Giorgio A; Zhang, Cheng; Satler, Lowell F; Ben-Dor, Itsik; Hashim, Hayder; Rogers, Toby; Weintraub, William S; Waksman, Ron",Cardiovasc. revasc. med,331,4

This work aims to identify high-risk patients who have a high probability of changing from mild to critical COVID-19 (only account for 5% of cases). Methods: Using traditional convolutional neural networks for classification may not be suitable to identify this 5% of high-risk patients from an entire dataset due to the highly imbalanced label distribution. To address this problem, we propose a Mix Contrast (MixCo) model, which matches original features with mixed features for contrastive learning. Three modules are proposed for training MixCo: 1) a cumulative learning strategy for synthesizing the mixed feature; 2) a commutative feature combination module for learning the commutative law of feature concatenation; 3) a united pairwise loss assigning adaptive weights for sample pairs with different class anchors based on their current optimization status. Results: We collect a multi-center computed tomography dataset including 918 confirmed COVID-19 patients from four hospitals and evaluate the proposed method on both the COVID-19 mild-to-critical prediction and COVID-19 diagnosis tasks. For mild-to-critical prediction, the experimental results show a recall of 0.80 and a specificity of 0.815. For diagnosis, the model shows comparable results with deep neural networks using a large dataset. Our method demonstrates improvements when the amount of training data is small or imbalanced. Significance: Identifying mild-to-critical COVID-19 patients is important for early prevention and personalized treatment planning.","Zhu, Yongbei; Wang, Shuo; Wang, Siwen; Wu, Qingxia; Wang, Liusu; Li, Hongjun; Wang, Meiyun; Niu, Meng; Zha, Yunfei; Tian, Jie",IEEE trans. biomed. eng,331,20

However, no clinical research has investigated their relevance. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to compare the guidance applied for the prevention of the COVID-19 epidemic between the LTCFs having been contaminated by COVID-19 and LTCFs having not been contaminated. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent and systematically accompanied by phone call to the 132 LTCFs of Haute-Garonne (Occitania region, South-West of France). The questionnaire focused on the preventive measures implemented before March 23, 2020 (first LTCFs contaminated in this area). The questionnaire focused on physician support, implementation of usual guidance (eg, masks, hydro-alcoholic solute used), training on hygiene, containment in residents' rooms and other distancing measures, use of temporary workers, compartmentalization within zones of residents and staff and a self-assessment analogic scale on the quality of the application of the preventive measures. We compared implementation of the guidance between the LTCFs with at least one case of COVID-19 among residents and/or health care professionals and LTCFs without COVID-19 case (between March 23rd and May 6th). RESULTS: 124 LTCFs participated (93.9%). 30 LTCFs (24.19%) were contaminated with COVID-19. Large heterogeneity of the application of the guidance was observed. Public LTCFs (OR= 0.39 (0.20-0.73), LTCFs which organized staff compartmentalization within zones (OR= 0.19 (0.07-0.48)), and LTCF with a staff who self-assessed a higher quality implementation of the preventive measures (OR= 0.65 (0.43-0.98)) were significantly more likely to avoid contamination by the COVID-19 outbreak. CONCLUSION: Our study supports the relevance of guidance to prevent the entry of COVID-19, in particular the staff compartmentalization within zones, as well as the perception of the staff regarding the quality of implementation of those measures in LTCFs.","Rolland, Y; Lacoste, M-H; de Mauleon, A; Ghisolfi, A; De Souto Barreto, P; Blain, H; Villars, H",J Nutr Health Aging,331,16

Methods: We performed a retrospective study of patients admitted with COVID-19 and evaluated outcomes in those with and without COPD and/or emphysema. Patients were identified as having COPD if they had a diagnosis in the medical record and a history of airflow-obstruction on spirometry, or a history of tobacco use and prescribed long-acting bronchodilator(s). Computed tomography scans were evaluated by radiologists. Propensity matching was performed for age, body-mass index (BMI), and serologic data correlated with severity of COVID-19 disease (D-dimer, C-reactive protein, ferritin, fibrinogen, absolute lymphocyte count, lymphocyte percentage, and lactate dehydrogenase). Results: Of 577 patients admitted with COVID-19, 103 had a diagnosis of COPD and/or emphysema. The COPD/emphysema cohort was older (67 vs 58, p<0.0001) than the other cohort and had a lower BMI. Among unmatched cohorts those with COPD/emphysema had higher rates of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (35% vs 24.9%, p=0.036) and maximal respiratory support requirements, with more frequent invasive mechanical ventilation (21.4% vs 11.8%), but no significant difference in mortality. After propensity-matching there was no difference in ICU admission, maximal respiratory support requirements, or mortality. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses yielded similar results. Discussion: Our propensity-matched retrospective cohort study suggests that patients hospitalized with COVID-19 that have COPD and/or emphysema may not have worse outcomes than those without these comorbid conditions.","Marron, Robert M; Zheng, Matthew; Fernandez Romero, Gustavo; Zhao, Huaqing; Patel, Raj; Leopold, Ian; Thomas, Ashanth; Standiford, Taylor; Kumaran, Maruti; Patlakh Jeffrey Stewart, Nicole; Criner, Gerard J",,331,16

DATA SOURCES: De-identified summary data derived from medical claims and eligibility files were provided by Independence Blue Cross for women receiving mammograms. STUDY DESIGN: We used a difference-in-differences approach to characterize the change in mammograms performed over time and a queueing formula to estimate the time to clear the queue of missed mammograms. DATA COLLECTION: We used data from the first 30 weeks of each year from 2018 to 2020. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Over the 20 weeks following March 11, 2020, the volume of screening mammograms and diagnostic mammograms fell by 58% and 38% of expected levels, on average. Lowest volumes were observed in week 15 (April 8 to 14), when screening and diagnostic mammograms fell by 99% and 74%, respectively. Volumes began to rebound in week 19 (May), with diagnostic mammograms reaching levels to similar to previous years' and screening mammograms remaining 14% below expectations.

They are at high risk of exposure, as well as physical and psychological stress. Nevertheless, the psychological influence of working during the pandemic still needs to be explored. Objective: This study aims to assess the anxiety symptoms among otolaryngology residents in Saudi Arabia during the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional qualitative study was carried out via a survey sent to otolaryngology residents in Saudi Arabia. The questionnaire collected demographic data and included questions using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale to evaluate the residents' anxiety toward working during the pandemic. Data analysis was conducted using R v 3.6.2. Results: Ninety-three otolaryngology residents completed the online questionnaire with a response rate of 42.5%. Of them, 30.1% had been in contact with confirmed COVID-19 patients. More than two-thirds of the respondents (68.8%) suffered from anxiety based on the GAD-7 scale;in the results, 45.2% had mild anxiety, 12.9% had moderate anxiety, and 10.8% had severe anxiety. Almost 24% of the respondents suffered from anxiety with a score of 10 or greater on the GAD-7 used as a cutoff point. Anxiety was more prevalent in married residents compared with single ones (18.9% vs. 5.45%, P = 0.002). In addition, it was prevalent in 40% of smokers compared with 5.13% of nonsmokers (P = 0.001).

Aim is to report our experience in the surgical treatment of gastric cancer in a European center. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospectively maintained database identified 515 patients. Staging laparoscopy was performed to rule out peritoneal carcinomatosis in suspicious cases. Type of surgery and lymphadenectomy were determined according to the Japanese guidelines and pathological staging according to the TNM classification. Survival was analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Staging laparoscopy avoided 150 (29.1%) unnecessary laparotomies. A total of 356 patients underwent surgery with curative intent. Overall postoperative morbidity and mortality rates were 16.8% and 5.9%, respectively. Two hundred-fifty-one patients (70%) were T3-T4. Negative lymph-nodes were observed in 71 patients (19.9%). One-hundred- seventy-nine were at least stage III. At a mean follow-up of 80.6 months, the overall and disease-free survival rates were 54.4% and 50.6%, respectively. The survival stratification based on the type of lymphadenectomy showed an overall survival rate of 43% and 65.5% in case of D1 and D2 lymphadenectomy, respectively. Based on the tumor stage the overall survival rate was 90%, 62.7%, 36.4% and the disease-free survival was 90%, 54.3%, 31.3%, for stage I, II and III, respectively.

Although effective treatments exist, OCD often remains underdetected and undertreated. METHODS: The authors performed a scoping review of the literature (of articles in PubMed and PsycINFO published from January 1, 2000, to February 1, 2020) to define gaps in OCD diagnosis and treatment among U.S. adults. Interventions at the patient, clinician, and health care system levels used to address these gaps are described, and promising approaches from around the world are highlighted. RESULTS: Of 102 potential studies identified in the search, 27 (including five non-U.S. studies) were included. The studies revealed that lack of clinician and patient knowledge about OCD and misdiagnosis contributes to its underdetection. Suboptimal prescribing of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor medications and limited use of exposure and response prevention, as a first-line psychotherapy, contribute to OCD undertreatment. Digital health technologies show promise in increasing OCD detection and delivery of evidence-based care and in ensuring continuity of care (including during the COVID-19 pandemic). CONCLUSIONS: Given the significant rates of disability, morbidity, and mortality associated with OCD, addressing gaps in OCD care will reduce the U.S. burden of mental illness. Further research is needed to determine how the use of digital health technologies can increase the detection and management of OCD.","Senter, Meredith S; Patel, Sapana R; Dixon, Lisa B; Myers, Robert W; Simpson, H Blair",Psychiatr Serv,331,3

We investigated the impact of acute and chronic changes in carbon supply on inter-guild competition in two moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBR), operated with (R1) and without (R0) external organic carbon supply. The microbial and nitrifying community composition of the reactors differed significantly. Interestingly, acute increases in the dissolved organic carbon inhibited nitrification in R1 ten times more than in R0. A sustained increase in the carbon supply decreased nitrification efficiency and increased denitrification activity to a greater extent in R1, and also increased the proportion of potential denitrifiers in both bioreactors. The findings suggest that autotrophic biofilms subjected to increases in carbon supply show higher nitrification and lower denitrification activity than carbon-fed biofilms. This has significant implications for the design of nitrifying bioreactors. Specifically, efficient removal of organic matter before the nitrification unit can improve the robustness of the bioreactor to varying influent quality. Thus, maintaining a low C/N ratio is important in nitrifying biofilters when acute carbon stress is expected or when anoxic activity (e.g. denitrification or H2S production) is undesirable, such as in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS).","Navada, Sharada; Knutsen, Maja F; Bakke, Ingrid; Vadstein, Olav",Sci Rep,331,5

Previous studies have shown that occupational exposure to acid mist or acidic solutions is a major risk factor for oral diseases. However, the findings are inconsistent and do not consider individual factors and lifestyles that may cause the same oral diseases. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive oral health survey and collected detail information to confirm the effect of acidic solution exposure on worker's oral health. METHODS: From 4 acidic solution factories, a total of 309 subjects (157 in control and 152 in exposed group) was enrolled. All participants competed oral examinations and self-report questionnaire, including the decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT) index, community periodontal index (CPI), loss of attachment (LA) index, and tooth erosion. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association between the acidic solution exposure and oral health. RESULTS: The results showed that acid exposure was correlated with soft oral tissue injury rather than hard oral tissue in our survey. In the multivariate model (adjusted for sex, age, worked years, education level, mouthwash use, dental floss use, tooth brushing, mask use, smoking, drinking, chewing areca and dietary habits with acidic foods), significant relationships of acid exposure with LA score were observed (OR = 2.32, 95% CI 1.03-5.26). However, the presence of acid exposure was not significantly associated with tooth erosion, DMFT, and CPITN. CONCLUSION: Our study highlighted that occupational acid exposure was an independent risk factor for periodontal health, especially LA. It is important to strengthen occupational hazard control, educate workers on oral disease and related factors, and raise the awareness of oral hygiene.","Chen, Wei-Liang; Chen, Yuan-Yuei; Wu, Wei-Te; Lai, Ching-Huang; Sun, Yu-Shan; Wang, Chung-Ching",BMC Public Health,331,16

METHODS: Paediatric patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 15 and March 15, 2020, from seven hospitals in Zhejiang Province, China, were collected retrospectively and analysed. RESULTS: Thirty-two children with COVID-19, ranging in age from 3 months to 18 years, were enrolled. Family aggregation occurred in 87.5% of infant and preschool-aged children (7/8), and also school-aged children (14/16), but in only 12.5% (1/8) of adolescents (p < 0.05, p < 0.001). Most of these patients had mild symptoms: mainly fever (20/32) followed by cough (10/32) and fatigue (4/32). The average durations of viral RNA in respiratory samples and gastrointestinal samples were 15.8 d and 28.9 d, respectively. Detox duration in faeces decreased with age: 39.8 d, 27.5 d and 20.4 d in infants and preschool children, school children, and adolescents respectively (p0-6, -18 <0.01, p0-6, -14 <0.05). Pneumonia was found in 14 children, but there was no statistical significance in the incidence of pneumonia between different age groups. Thirty patients were treated with antiviral drugs, and all patients were stable and gradually improved after admission. CONCLUSIONS: Most children with COVID-19 had a mild process and a good prognosis. More attention should be paid to investigation of household contact history in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in young children. Viral RNA lasts longer in the gastrointestinal system than in the respiratory tract, especially in younger children.","Chen, Z; Tong, L; Zhou, Y; Hua, C; Wang, W; Fu, J; Shu, Q; Hong, L; Xu, H; Xu, Z; Chen, Y; Mao, Y; Ye, S; Wu, X; Wang, L; Luo, Y; Zou, X; Tao, X; Zhang, Y",Clin. microbiol. infect,331,7

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between triploid and full-sib diploid poplar trees were identified from two transcriptomic data sets followed by a gene association study among DEGs to identify key leaf growth regulators. Yeast one-hybrid system, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and dual-luciferase assay were employed to substantiate that PpnGRF5-1 directly regulated PpnCKX1. The interactions between PpnGRF5-1 and GRF-interacting factors were experimentally validated and a multilayered hierarchical regulatory network (ML-hGRN)-mediated by PpnGRF5-1 was constructed with Top-down GGM algorithm by combining RNA-seq data from its overexpression (OE) lines and DAP-seq data. PpnGRF5-1 is a negative regulator of PpnCKX1. OE of PpnGRF5-1 in diploid transgenic lines resulted in larger leaves resembling those of triploids, and significantly increased zeatin and isopentenyladenine in the apical buds and third leaves. PpnGRF5-1 also interacted with GIFs to increase its regulatory diversity and capacity. An ML-hGRN-mediated by PpnGRF5-1 was obtained and could largely elucidate larger leaves. PpnGRF5-1 and the ML-hGRN-mediated by PpnGRF5-1 were underlying the leaf growth and development.","Wu, Wenqi; Li, Jiang; Wang, Qiao; Lv, Kaiwen; Du, Kang; Zhang, Wenli; Li, Quanzi; Kang, Xiangyang; Wei, Hairong",,331,16

We focus on high-tech entrepreneurial ventures because these are the firms that jolts affect most; in so doing, we also advance the understanding of DCs in the entrepreneurship field. We argue that, in the aftermath of an environmental jolt, the high-tech entrepreneurial ventures that use internationalization and new product development capabilities to modify their resource configuration and regain environmental fit enjoy better performance. Econometric estimates on a sample of 340 Italian high-tech entrepreneurial ventures confronting the consequences of the global economic crisis that began in 2008 confirm that separately using these two DCs has a positive performance effect. This effect is stronger for relatively smaller ventures. Interestingly, despite synergies should arise from the combined use of the two DCs, we do not detect any superadditive effects.","Colombo, Massimo G; Piva, Evila; Quas, Anita; Rossi-Lamastra, Cristina",Long Range Plann,331,12

To overcome deleterious freeze/thaw cycles and to reduce high costs for shipping and storage, we sought to develop a procedure which enables MALDI-MS protein profiling of blood serum proteins without the need for serum freezing. METHODS: Blood sera from patients/donors were divided into portions which after pre-incubation were fast frozen. Thawed aliquots were deposited on filter paper discs and air dried at room temperature. Intact serum proteins were eluted with acid-labile detergent-containing solutions and were desalted by employing a reverse-phase bead system. Purified protein solutions were screened by MALDI-MS using standardized instrument settings. RESULTS: MALDI mass spectra from protein solutions which were eluted from filter paper discs and desalted showed on average 25 strong ion signals (mass range m/z 6000 to m/z 10,000) from intact serum proteins (apolipoproteins, complement proteins, transthyretin and hemoglobin) and from proteolytic processing products. Semi-quantitative analysis of three ion pairs: m/z 6433 and 6631, m/z 8205 and 8916, as well as m/z 9275 and 9422 indicated that the mass spectra from either pre-incubated fast-frozen serum or pre-incubated dried serum spot eluted serum contained the same information on protein composition. CONCLUSIONS: A workflow that avoids the conventional cold-chain and yet enables to investigate intact serum proteins and/or serum proteolysis products by MALDI-MS profiling was developed. The here described protocol tremendously broadens clinical application of MALDI-MS and simultaneously allows to reduce the costs for storage and shipping of serum samples. This will pave the way for clinical screening of patients also in areas with limited access to health care systems, and/or specialized laboratories.","Okai, Charles A; Wölter, Manja; Russ, Manuela; Koy, Cornelia; Petre, Brindusa A; Rath, Werner; Pecks, Ulrich; Glocker, Michael O",Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom,331,30

METHODS: Six semi-structured phone interviews were conducted with veterinarians who have submitted samples for HeV antibody titre testing. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed to identify and report common themes within the data. RESULTS: Veterinarians are predominantly using the titre tests as an alternative to vaccination due to clients' fear of vaccine reactions. The high cost of titre testing, the difficulty interpreting titre results and a lack of titre test recognition by authorities were the major barriers reported to using this test. Some veterinarians detailed difficulties communicating titre test procedures and results to their clients. The majority of veterinarians accepted titres of 64 or greater as evidence of protective immunity and would rely on those results for 12 months. However, there was discrepancy of these values and the level of confidence veterinarians had in interpreting the results of HeV antibody titre tests varied. CONCLUSION: This study has provided an overview of the attitudes of horse owners and veterinarians towards HeV antibody titre testing. Although evidence for HeV vaccination titres as an indication of protective immunity is still inadequate, it will assist veterinarians in interpreting and communicating titre results.","Barrett, R S; Wiethoelter, A; Halpin, K",Aust. vet. j,331,16

Also, age and multimorbidity might be confounders. No sufficient data are available to demonstrate their independent role. We designed a cross-sectional, observational, multicenter, nationwide survey in Italy to verify whether renin-angiotensin system inhibitors are related to COVID-19 severe outcomes. We analyzed information from Italian patients diagnosed with COVID-19, admitted in 26 hospitals. One thousand five hundred ninety-one charts (male, 64.1%; 66±0.4 years) were recorded. At least 1 preexisting condition was observed in 73.4% of patients, with hypertension being the most represented (54.9%). One hundred eighty-eight deaths were recorded (11.8%; mean age, 79.6±0.9 years). In nonsurvivors, older age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery diseases, and heart failure were more represented than in survivors. The Charlson Comorbidity Index was significantly higher in nonsurvivors compared with survivors (4.3±0.15 versus 2.6±0.05; P<0.001). ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors, diuretics, and ß-blockers were more frequently used in nonsurvivors than in survivors. After correction by multivariate analysis, only age (P=0.0001), diabetes mellitus (P=0.004), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P=0.011), and chronic kidney disease (P=0.004) but not hypertension predicted mortality. Charlson Comorbidity Index, which cumulates age and comorbidities, predicts mortality with an exponential increase in the odds ratio by each point of score. In the COVID-19 outbreak, mortality is predicted by age and the presence of comorbidities. Our data do not support a significant interference of hypertension and antihypertensive therapy on COVID-19 lethality.

The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 pose a series of challenges both in understanding and delimiting the disease secondary to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is due to the fact that the main axis of this disease is the endothelial compromise and the production of a ""cytokine storm,"" triggering multiple organ failure and death. Given that a complete understanding of its pathophysiology and clinical behavior has not yet been achieved, we wondered if coinfection with other respiratory viruses modifies its performance and outcomes described so far. A literature search was performed, obtaining 68 articles, of which 25 were analyzed. The analysis showed us that there is a high variety both in the types of associated infections and in the clinical behavior of patients and their outcomes. Therefore, we consider that the search for other infections should be performed exhaustively, especially in those cases that may be susceptible to treatment such as Influenza A, human immunodeficiency virus, or bacterial infections. As well as optimize the analysis of these cases and establish if there are characteristics that allow establishing the possibility of carrying an additional infection to that of SARS-CoV-2 and the implications for the management and prognosis of the patient.","Barrera-López, Pedro; Pérez-Riveros, Erika D; Moreno-Montoya, José; Ballesteros, Silvia Marcela; Valencia, Sergio A; De la Hoz-Valle, José A",J Med Virol,331,1

Due to this infection, many countries of the world suffers from great economic loss. The researchers around the world are very active to make a plan and policy for its early eradication. The government officials have taken full action for the eradication of this virus using different possible control strategies. It is the first priority of the researchers to develop safe vaccine against this deadly disease to minimize the infection. Different approaches have been made in this regards for its elimination. In this study, we formulate a mathematical epidemic model to analyze the dynamical behavior and transmission patterns of this new pandemic. We consider the environmental viral concentration in the model to better study the disease incidence in a community. Initially, the model is constructed with the derivative of integer-order. The classical epidemic model is then reconstructed with the fractional order operator in the form of Atangana-Baleanu derivative with the nonsingular and nonlocal kernel in order to analyze the dynamics of Coronavirus infection in a better way. A well-known estimation approach is used to estimate model parameters from the COVID-19 cases reported in Saudi Arabia from March 1 till August 20, 2020. After the procedure of parameters estimation, we explore some basic mathematical analysis of the fractional model. The stability results are provided for the disease free case using fractional stability concepts. Further, the uniqueness and existence results will be shown using the Picard-Lendelof approach. Moreover, an efficient numerical scheme has been proposed to obtain the solution of the model numerically. Finally, using the real fitted parameters, we depict many simulation results in order to demonstrate the importance of various model parameters and the memory index on disease dynamics and possible eradication.","Alzahrani, Ebraheem; El-Dessoky, M M; Baleanu, Dumitru",Results Phys,331,10

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of month-to-month trends on waitlist additions, waitlist deaths, and transplant surgeries between all United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) regions was performed. A linear regression model trained on historical data was used to estimate anticipated transplantation volume. RESULTS: All UNOS regions reported a decrease in total waitlist additions and transplant surgeries. The largest decreases in total transplants were identified in regions 1, 2, 6, and 9, with regions 2, 7, 8, and 9 noting the largest decrease in waitlist additions. Six of the 11 regions noted increases in waitlist deaths, with UNOS regions 9, 1, and 2, all located within the Northeast, noting the highest percent increase in waitlist deaths at 170%, 89%, and 54%, respectively. The largest reductions in solid organ transplantation and waitlist deaths were seen in kidney and lung transplantation.

This paper describes the center's response from mid-March through June 30, 2020. METHODS: A comprehensive needs assessment was conducted with agricultural stakeholders. Agriculture-specific COVID-19 resources were developed and disseminated, and a farmer/employer survey was launched. RESULTS: The WCAHS COVID-19 resources web page, worksite checklist, and training guide were shared on over 50 web pages nationally. As of June 30, 2020, 282 online surveys have been received. Ongoing informal discussions with agricultural stakeholders indicate a disconnect between the experiences of farmers/employers and farmworkers in relation to COVID-19 prevention at the worksite. Initial survey responses indicate that implementing social distancing is one of the greatest challenges at the worksite. Confusion over local, state, and federal guidelines and which to follow is another concern. CONCLUSION: The WCAHS response to COVID-19, in close collaboration with agricultural stakeholders, represents a useful model for a rapid response to a public health crisis by regional centers. Key elements to its success include rapid personalized communication with a wide range of agricultural stakeholders, an actively engaged External Advisory Board, the development of industry-specific resources and information, recurring and iterative engagement with stakeholders as new COVID-19 information emerged and resources were developed, and the identification of the unique gap WCAHS was positioned to fill.

Brazil's expected case-fatality ratio was also adjusted by the population's age pyramid. Therefore, the notification rate can be defined as the number of confirmed cases (notified by the Ministry of Health) divided by the number of expected cases (estimated from the number of deaths). RESULTS: The reporting rate for COVID-19 in Brazil was estimated at 9.2% (95%CI 8.8% - 9.5%), with all the states presenting rates below 30%. São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the most populated states in Brazil, showed small reporting rates (8.9% and 7.2%, respectively). The highest reporting rate occurred in Roraima (31.7%) and the lowest in Paraiba (3.4%).

However, defining the transcriptomic signatures of disease is challenging because logistic, technical, and cost factors limit the size and representativeness of samples in clinical studies. These limitations lead to a poor performance of signatures when applied to new datasets. Although the study focuses on infection, the central hypothesis of the work is the generalization of sets of signatures across diseases. We use a machine learning approach to identify common elements in datasets and then test empirically whether they are informative about a second dataset from a disease or process distinct from the original dataset. We identify sets of genes, which we name transfer signatures, that are predictive across diverse datasets and/or species (e.g., rhesus to humans). We demonstrate the usefulness of transfer signatures in two use cases: the progression of latent to active tuberculosis and the severity of COVID-19 and influenza A H1N1 infection.

The broad significance of our work lies in the concept that a small set of archetypal human immunophenotypes, captured by transfer signatures, can explain a larger set of responses to diverse diseases.","di Iulio, Julia; Bartha, Istvan; Spreafico, Roberto; Virgin, Herbert W; Telenti, Amalio",Proc.

The Fabaceae family comprises a large variety of species that produce substances with diverse therapeutic potential, including anti-inflammatory activity. The limitations of current anti-inflammatories generate the need to research new anti-inflammatory structures with higher efficacy as well as develop methods for screening multiple samples, reliably and ethically, to assess such therapeutic properties. OBJECTIVE: Validate and apply a quantification method for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2 ) production from an ex vivo assay in human blood in order to screen anti-inflammatory activity present in many Fabaceae species extracts. METHODS: Human blood was incubated with extracts from 47 Fabaceae species. After lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation, PGE2 was quantified in the plasma by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The extracts that presented PGE2 production inhibition were further assessed through in vivo assay and then chemically characterised through an analysis of ultra-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionisation quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS2 ) data. RESULTS: The new ex vivo anti-inflammatory assay showed that five out of the 47 Fabaceae species inhibited PGE2 production. Results from an in vivo assay and the metabolic profile of the active extracts supported the anti-inflammatory potential of four species. CONCLUSION: The quantification method for PGE2 demonstrated fast, sensitive, precise, and accurate results. The new ex vivo anti-inflammatory assay comprised a great, reliable, and ethical approach for the screening of a large number of samples before an in vivo bioassay. Additionally, the four active extracts in both ex vivo and in vivo assays may be useful for the development of more efficient anti-inflammatory drugs.","Rosa, Welton; da Silva Domingos, Olívia; de Oliveira Salem, Paula Pio; Caldas, Ivo Santana; Murgu, Michael; Lago, João Henrique Ghilardi; Sartorelli, Patricia; Dias, Danielle Ferreira; Chagas-Paula, Daniela Aparecida; Soares, Marisi Gomes",Phytochem anal,331,6

We discuss the prospective behavioral and biological differences between the sexes that could be attributed to this sex-based differentiation. The female sex hormones and the immune stimulatory genes, including Toll-like receptors, interleukins, and micro-RNAs present on X-chromosome, may impart lesser infectivity and mortality of the SARS-CoV-2 in females over males. The sex hormone estrogen interacts with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, one of the most critical pathways in COVID-19 infectivity, and modulates the vasomotor homeostasis. Testosterone on the contrary enhances the levels of the two most critical molecules, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the transmembrane protease serine-type 2 (TMPRSS2), transcriptionally and posttranslationally, thereby increasing viral load and delaying viral clearance in men as compared with women. We propose that modulating sex hormones, either by increasing estrogen or antiandrogen, may be a therapeutic option to reduce mortality from SARS-CoV-2.","Chanana, Neha; Palmo, Tsering; Sharma, Kavita; Kumar, Rahul; Graham, Brian B; Pasha, Qadar",Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab,331,25

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has proved to be one of the most significant disruptors of vital sectors of human endeavor in modern times. In the healthcare sector, there is an increasing advocacy to deliver non-urgent care via telemedicine. This paper examined the current state of tele-neurology practice and infrastructural preparedness in sub-Saharan Africa. Currently, there is over 70% mobile phone penetration in most of the countries and virtually all of them have mobile internet services of different technologies and generations. Although the needed infrastructure is increasingly available, it should be improved upon.

BACKGROUND: Along with the increasing number of infections, the world has paid widespread attention to COVID-19. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used a convenience sampling method that included a demographics questionnaire and the Nurses' Perceived Professional Benefits Questionnaire. The survey was distributed to 1,787 nurses from 36 hospitals in China. RESULTS: In total, 1,176 questionnaires were usable for this research. 92.79% of nurses were willing to participate in care of patients with COVID-19. Intensive care unit (ICU) nurses were less willing to participate, while surgical nurses were more willing to participate. In addition, nurses with high positive professional perception scores were more willing to participate than those with low scores. CONCLUSION: The vast majority of nurses were willing to participate in care of patients with COVID-19 in China. Surgical nurses and nurses with positive professional perceptions are more likely to be willing to participate in treatment. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: To increase nurses' willingness to participate in care of patients with COVID-19, improving the sense of perceived professional benefits, offering salary and offering paid sick leave for nursing staff are effective ways. In addition, raising the awareness of infectious diseases and increased pre-disaster training during infectious diseases is critical.","Wu, Bainv; Zhao, Yun; Xu, Dejing; Wang, Yan; Niu, Niu; Zhang, Maomao; Zhi, Xiaoxu; Zhu, Ping; Meng, Aifeng",J. nurs. manag,331,16

On that date, there were 134,576 reported cases and 4981 deaths worldwide. By March 26, 2020, just 2 weeks later, reported cases had increased four-fold to 531,865, and deaths increased five-fold to 24,073. Older people are both major users of telehealth services and are more likely to die as a result of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This paper examines the extent that Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, during the 2 weeks following the pandemic announcement, sought to promote telehealth as a tool that could help identify COVID-19 among older people who may live alone, be frail, or be self-isolating, and give support to or facilitate the treatment of people who are or may be infected. METHODS: This paper reports, for the 2-week period previously mentioned and immediately prior, on activities and initiatives in the three countries taken by governments or their agencies (at national or state levels) together with publications or guidance issued by professional, trade, and charitable bodies. Different sources of information are drawn upon that point to the perceived likely benefits of telehealth in fighting the pandemic. It is not the purpose of this paper to draw together or analyze information that reflects growing knowledge about COVID-19, except where telehealth is seen as a component. RESULTS: The picture that emerges for the three countries, based on the sources identified, shows a number of differences. These differences center on the nature of their health services, the extent of attention given to older people (and the circumstances that can relate to them), the different geographies (notably concerned with rurality), and the changes to funding frameworks that could impact these. Common to all three countries is the value attributed to maintaining quality safeguards in the wider context of their health services but where such services are noted as sometimes having precluded significant telehealth use. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic is forcing changes and may help to establish telehealth more firmly in its aftermath. Some of the changes may not be long-lasting. However, the momentum is such that telehealth will almost certainly find a stronger place within health service frameworks for each of the three countries and is likely to have increased acceptance among both patients and health care providers.","Fisk, Malcolm; Livingstone, Anne; Pit, Sabrina Winona",J Med Internet Res,331,26

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to study the social and mental effects of the pandemic. We focused on individuals living in private households aged 40 years and older. Participants were asked about pandemic-related changes in receiving and providing support (e.g. personal care, help with household chores), problems arising in taking care of older persons and changes in well-being. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted descriptive and multivariate analyses to show how support changed, problems with support came up and well-being changed in the light of the pandemic and how all this was related. RESULTS: Due to the pandemic older respondents in particular were no longer able to provide the necessary support for others. Especially women reported problems in taking care of older individuals. We found a decrease in well-being for all respondents but most significantly for women and individuals aged 80 years and older. Moreover, problems in the provision of care due to the pandemic and lower well-being were clearly linked. CONCLUSION: Our study showed significant changes in support patterns and well-being due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A substantial part of the respondents reported more loneliness and lower life satisfaction compared to before the pandemic, especially women supporting others. In these pandemic times, informal caregiving is severely hampered. Future pandemic-related measures should be carefully planned bearing such issues in mind.","Brandt, Martina; Garten, Claudius; Grates, Miriam; Kaschowitz, Judith; Quashie, Nekehia; Schmitz, Alina",Z Gerontol Geriatr,331,21

We also examined the association of the degree of pes planovalgus with muscle mass of the ankle joint and foot muscles in children with DS and children with TD. The subjects were 24 children with TD (control [CTR] group) and 23 children with DS (DS group). To assess pes planovalgus, the Arch Height Index (AHI) in the standing position was measured. Muscle thickness of the ankle joint and foot muscles was measured using an ultrasound imaging device. The AHI and thickness of the soleus and tibialis posterior muscles were significantly lower in the DS group than those in the CTR group. The thickness of the flexor digitorum longus muscle was significantly greater in the DS group than that in the CTR group. Stepwise regression analysis revealed that the thickness of the flexor digitorum longus muscle was a significant and independent factor of the AHI in children comprising the CTR and DS groups. The thickness of the flexor digitorum longus muscle increased with decreasing AHI. The results of this study suggest that the AHI and muscle mass of the soleus and tibialis posterior muscles decrease, while muscle mass of the flexor digitorum longus muscle increases in children with DS. The results also indicate that decreased AHI is associated with increased muscle mass of the flexor digitorum longus muscle in children.","Masaki, Mitsuhiro; Sugawara, Karin; Iizuka, Yuka; Uchikawa, Yuki; Isobe, Honoka; Hattori, Fuyumi; Mano, Koki; Saito, Keiko; Sugino, Ayaka; Kato, Kana; Sakaino, Kenji",J Biomech,331,5

The results often largely depend on the approach used to value mortality risk reductions, typically expressed as the value per statistical life (VSL). Many analyses rely on a population-average VSL estimate; some adjust VSL for life expectancy at the age of death. We explore the implications of theory and empirical studies, which suggest that the relationship between age and VSL is uncertain. We compare the effects of three approaches: (1) an invariant population-average VSL; (2) a constant value per statistical life-year (VSLY); and (3) a VSL that follows an inverse-U pattern, peaking in middle age. We find that when applied to the U.S. age distribution of COVID-19 deaths, these approaches result in average VSL estimates of $10.63 million, $4.47 million, and $8.31 million. We explore the extent to which applying these estimates alters the conclusions of frequently cited analyses of social distancing, finding that they significantly affect the findings. However, these analyses do not address other characteristics of COVID-19 deaths that may increase or decrease the VSL estimates. Examples include the health status and income level of those affected, the size of the risk change, and the extent to which the risk is dreaded, uncertain, involuntarily incurred, and outside of one's control. The effects of these characteristics and their correlation with age are uncertain; it is unclear whether they amplify or diminish the effects of age on VSL.","Robinson, Lisa A; Sullivan, Ryan; Shogren, Jason F",Risk Anal,331,16

Programs to prevent CTF involve several procedures, including immunization, chemoprophylaxis and use of ectoparasiticides, together with the vector control in the environment. The objective of this study was to report an acute outbreak of CTF in a group of 157 Hereford cattle from a farm without presence of the vector, that were moved to a farm in the same state with a high tick infestation (Rhipicephalus microplus). On the day before the transportation, the animals received a chemoprophylaxis with imidocarb dipropionate (3 mg/kg, SC), which was repeated 21 days after the first application. After 42 days, some animals showed signs compatible with CTF, which was confirmed through clinical examination, necropsy, histopathological and hemoparasitological analyses.

Considering the complexity of disease transmission dynamics in cities, stochastic epidemic models include uncertainty in their treatment of the problem, allowing the estimation of the probability of an outbreak, the distribution of epidemic magnitudes, and their expected duration. In this sense, we propose a kinetic Monte Carlo epidemic model that focuses on demography and on age-structured mobility data to simulate the evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak in the capital of Brazil, Brasilia, under several scenarios of mobility restriction. We show that the distribution of epidemic outcomes can be divided into short-lived mild outbreaks and longer severe ones. We demonstrate that quarantines have the effect of reducing the probability of a severe outbreak taking place but are unable to mitigate the magnitude of these outbreaks once they happen. Finally, we present the probability of a particular trajectory in the epidemic progression resulting in a massive outbreak as a function of the cumulative number of cases at the end of each quarantine period, allowing for the estimation of the risk associated with relaxing mobility restrictions at a given time.","de Sousa, Leonardo Evaristo; Neto, Pedro Henrique de Oliveira; Filho, Demetrio Antônio da Silva",Phys Rev E,331,1

Racial and ethnic disparities in health care have been well documented in COVID-19 with respect to risk of infection and in-hospital outcomes once admitted, and here we assess disparities in those who access healthcare via telemedicine for COVID-19 . MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electronic health record data of patients at New York University Langone Health between March 19th and April 30, 2020 were used to conduct descriptive and multilevel regression analyses with respect to visit type (telemedicine or in-person), suspected COVID diagnosis and COVID test results. RESULTS: Controlling for individual and community-level attributes, Black patients had 0.6 times the adjusted odds (95%CI:0.58-0.63) of accessing care through telemedicine compared to white patients, though they are increasingly accessing telemedicine for urgent care, driven by a younger and female population. COVID diagnoses were significantly more likely for Black versus white telemedicine patients. DISCUSSION: There are disparities for Black patients accessing telemedicine, however increased uptake by young, female Black patients. Mean income and decreased mean household size of Zip code were also significantly related to telemedicine use. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine access disparities reflect those in in-person healthcare access. Roots of disparate use are complex and reflect individual, community, and structural factors, including their intersection; many of which are due to systemic racism.

The aim of this survey was to estimate declines in imaging volumes and financial impact across different practice settings during April 2020. METHODS: The survey, comprising 48 questions, was conducted among members of the ACR and the Radiology Business Management Association during May 2020. Survey questions focused on practice demographics, volumes, financials, personnel and staff adjustments, and anticipation of recovery. RESULTS: During April 2020, nearly all radiology practices reported substantial (56.4%-63.7%) declines in imaging volumes, with outpatient imaging volumes most severely affected. Mean gross charges declined by 50.1% to 54.8% and collections declined by 46.4% to 53.9%. Percentage reductions did not correlate with practice size. The majority of respondents believed that volumes would recover but not entirely (62%-88%) and anticipated a short-term recovery, with a surge likely in the short term due to postponement of elective imaging (52%-64%). About 16% of respondents reported that radiologists in their practices tested positive for COVID-19. More than half (52.3%) reported that availability of personal protective equipment had become an issue or was inadequate. A majority (62.3%) reported that their practices had existing remote reading or teleradiology capabilities in place before the pandemic, and 22.3% developed such capabilities in response to the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Radiology practices across different settings experienced substantial declines in imaging volumes and collections during the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020. Most are actively engaged in both short- and long-term operational adjustments.","Malhotra, Ajay; Wu, Xiao; Fleishon, Howard B; Duszak, Richard; Silva, Ezequiel; McGinty, Geraldine B; Bender, Claire; Williams, Beth; Pashley, Neale; Stengel, Casey J B; Naidich, Jason J; Hughes, Danny; Sanelli, Pina C",J Am Coll Radiol,331,15

During the national lockdown, referral numbers and confirmed uveal melanoma cases reduced considerably, equalling to ~120 fewer diagnosed uveal melanoma cases compared to previous 2 years. Contrary to the recent trend, increased caseloads of enucleation and stereotactic radiosurgery (p > 0.05), in comparison to fewer proton beam therapy (p < 0.05), were performed. In the 4-month period following lockdown, there was a surge in clinical activities with more advanced diseases (p < 0.05) presenting to the services.

This strategy may also hold promise for treating acute hyperinflammation, such as observed in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), highlighting a need to define regulators of IL-6 homeostasis. We found that conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), defined in mice via expression of the transcription factor Zbtb46, were a major source of circulating sIL-6R and, thus, systemically regulated IL-6 signaling. This was uncovered through identification of a cDC-dependent but T cell-independent modality that naturally adjuvants plasma cell differentiation and antibody responses to protein antigens. This pathway was then revealed as part of a broader biological buffer system in which cDC-derived sIL-6R set the in-solution persistence of IL-6.

This article discusses the optimum design of an indoor and semi-outdoor air purifier, using a water-based filtration system. METHODS: An air purifier was fabricated, then comparison of purifying efficacy of the system between untreated air and using an air pump was done. Incense smoke was generated within a room for 10 seconds. The number of particle sizes of PM0.3, PM0.5, PM1.0, PM3.0, PM5.0, and PM10 µm (particle/ m3) as well as the detection of mass concentration of PM1.0, PM2.5, PM5.0, and PM10 (mg/m3) at 0 and 5â¯min were recorded. Each experiment was repeated 10 times. RESULTS: Particles in untreated air, except PM10, showed the maximum increase rate of the number of particle sizes greater than the air pump experiment. The highest differentiation between two methods was that PM1.0 and PM0.5 of untreated air increased to 113.647 and 61.539 % whereas the air pump method showed 4.720 and 2.533 %, respectively. The PM mass concentration of untreated air increased from 50.217 to 51.167 % while the increased rate of PM using an air pump was 2.784 to 2.902 %. CONCLUSION: This study proposed a water-based air filtration technique, which can reduce the level of particulate matter, and also is a low-cost prototype. For the next experiment, the study should extend test length, clarify an optimum ratio of disinfectant technologies, connect with the internet of things, compare the efficiency with a HEPA filter air purifier, and then also measure some particles which are smaller than 0.2â¯µm.","Jumlongkul, Arnon",Environ Res,331,20

Management of thrombi in ECMO is generally an important issue, however especially in ECMO for COVID-19 patients who are prone to thrombus formation, the thrombus formation in oxygenators is an unresolved issue for medical professionals, and it is very difficult to deal with. To prevent thromboembolic complications, it is necessary to develop a method for early thrombus detection. We developed a novel method for detailed real-time observation of thrombi formed in oxygenators using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging. The purpose of this study was to verify the efficacy of this novel method through animal experiments. The experiments were performed three times using three pigs equipped with veno-arterial ECMO comprising a centrifugal pump (CAPIOX SL) and an oxygenator (QUADROX). To create thrombogenic conditions, the pump flow rate was set at 1 L/min without anticoagulation. Diluted ICG was intravenously administered, and the oxygenator was observed with both an optical detector (PDE-neo) and the naked eye every hour until 8 h after measurement initiation. Under ICG fluorescence imaging, the inside of the oxygenator was observed as a white area. A black dot-like area suspected to be the thrombus appeared 6-8 h after measurement initiation. The thrombus could not be recognized in detail with the naked eye observation until the oxygenator was rinsed with physiological saline. The thrombus and the black area on ICG fluorescence imaging were finely matched in terms of morphology. Thus, we succeeded in real-time thrombus detection in an oxygenator using ICG fluorescence imaging. The combined use of ICG imaging and conventional routine screening tests could compensate for each other's weaknesses and significantly improve the safety of ECMO.","Sakurai, Hironobu; Fujiwara, Tatsuki; Ohuchi, Katsuhiro; Hijikata, Wataru; Inoue, Yusuke; Seki, Haruna; Tahara, Tomoki; Yokota, Sachie; Ogata, Asato; Mizuno, Tomohiro; Arai, Hirokuni",Artif. organs,331,20

Reported findings indicate that a direct viral-mediated hyperinflammatory response leads to local thromboinflammation. According to those findings, the incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in patients with COVID-19 and PE should be low. The objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence of DVT in patients with COVID-19 who developed PE. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, consecutive patients hospitalized in the internal medicine ward with a diagnosis of COVID-19 who developed PE were screened for DVT in the lower extremities with complete compression ultrasound. RESULTS: The study comprised 26 patients. Fifteen patients (57.7%) were male. The median age was 60 years (interquartile range, 54-73 years). Compression ultrasound findings were positive for DVT in 2 patients (7.7%; 95% confidence interval, 3.6%-11.7%). Patients with DVT had central and bilateral PE. In both, venous thromboembolism was diagnosed in the emergency department, so they did not receive previous prophylactic therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin. Patients without DVT had higher median d-dimer levels: 25,688 µg/dL (interquartile range, 80,000-1210 µg/dL) versus 5310 µg/dL (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed a low incidence of DVT in a cohort of patients with COVID-19 and PE. This observation suggests that PE in these patients could be produced mainly by a local thromboinflammatory syndrome induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and not by a thromboembolic event.","Franco-Moreno, Anabel; Herrera-Morueco, Maria; Mestre-Gómez, Beatriz; Muñoz-Rivas, Nuria; Abad-Motos, Ane; Salazar-Chiriboga, Danilo; Duffort-Falcó, Mercedes; Medrano-Izquierdo, Pilar; Bustamante-Fermosel, Ana; Pardo-Guimera, Virginia; Ulla-Anés, Mariano; Torres-Macho, Juan",J. ultrasound med,331,1

Our understanding of the impact this virus has on the nervous system is limited. Our review aims to inform and improve decision-making among the physicians treating COVID-19 by presenting a systematic analysis of the neurological manifestations experienced within these patients. METHODS: Any study, released prior to May 20, 2020, that reported neurological manifestations in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 was systematically reviewed using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic review and Meta-Analysis) statement. RESULTS: Our systematic review included data from 37 articles: twelve retrospective studies, two prospective studies, and the rest case reports/series. The most commonly reported neurological manifestations of COVID-19 were myalgia, headache, altered sensorium, hyposmia, and hypogeusia. Uncommonly, COVID-19 can also present with central nervous system manifestations such as ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, encephalo-myelitis, and acute myelitis, peripheral nervous manifestations such as Guillain-Barré syndrome and Bell's palsy, and skeletal muscle manifestations such as rhabdomyolysis. CONCLUSION: While COVID-19 typically presents as a self-limiting respiratory disease, it has been reported in up to 20% of patients to progress to severe illness with multi-organ involvement. The neurological manifestations of COVID-19 are not uncommon, but our study found most resolve with treatment of the underlying infection.

The present study aimed at investigating the psychological distress of parents during the lockdown, identifying contributing factors. An online survey was administered to 833 participants from 3 to 15 April 2020. Mediation and moderated mediation models were run to explore the association between parent neuroticism and parent distress, mediated by child hyperactivity-inattention and child emotional symptoms, and the moderating effect of living only with child(ren) on the direct and indirect effects of parent neuroticism on parent distress. For parents living only with child(ren), high levels of psychological distress depended exclusively on their levels of neuroticism. For parents living with at least one other person in addition to child(ren), distress levels were also mediated by child behavioral and emotional difficulties. Motherhood emerged as a significant factor contributing to greater distress. Furthermore, parent psychological distress decreased in line with increased child age. The results confirm that neuroticism is an important risk factor for mental health. Preventive measures should be primarily target multicomponent families with younger children and directed towards parents who are already known to present emotional instability and to parents of children who have received local mental health assistance for behavioral and/or emotional difficulties.","Mazza, Cristina; Ricci, Eleonora; Marchetti, Daniela; Fontanesi, Lilybeth; Di Giandomenico, Serena; Verrocchio, Maria Cristina; Roma, Paolo",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),331,16

Median CD4 count was 566 cells/mm3 [347, 726] and six had detectable plasma HIV viral loads. Median duration of HIV was 17 years [7, 22] and 30 individuals had been prescribed antiretroviral therapy. Five persons were asymptomatic. Of symptomatic persons, 21 (12%), 1 (4%) and 3 (12%) individuals had mild, moderate and severe disease, respectively. Three individuals died with COVID-19. In one case, the cause of death was due to COVID-19, whereas in the other two cases, the individuals died with positive COVID-19 test results but the immediate cause of death is unclear. PLWH who tested positive for COVID-19 had low socioeconomic status and had employment or living conditions that put them at high risk. PLWH may be disproportionately impacted by the social determinants of health which predispose them to COVID-19.","Fehr, Derek; Lebouché, Bertrand; Ruppenthal, Luciana; Brownc, Melodie; Obasc, Nancy; Bourbonnière, Emilie; Girouard, Josee; Massicotte, Angie; Jenabian, Mohammad-Ali; Almomen, Abdul-Aziz; Frenette, Charles; de Pokomandy, Alexandra; Cox, Joseph; Giannakis, Andreas; Cheng, Matthew; Kronfli, Nadine; Tsoukas, Christos; Zahedi, Navid; Szabo, Jason; Dehghani, Kianoush; Brouillette, Marie-Josee; Falutz, Julian; Turner, Howard; Hamel, Alexandra; Duchesneau, Claire; Lanthier-Brun, Jasmine; Klein, Marina; Routy, Jean-Pierre; Costiniuk, Cecilia T",AIDS Care,331,25

Patients' ages, COVID-19 PCR results, presence of pneumonia, total testosterone, luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) values were recorded. It was evaluated whether there were significant differences between people who were positive for COVID-19 and those who were not. Any differences between those who had COVID-19 pneumonia and those who did not were also recorded. There was no difference between the FSH, LH and testosterone values of the COVID-19 PCR positive and negative patients (p = 0.80, vp = 0.62, p = 0.56 respectively). However when LH values were separated as low, normal and high, LH values were statistically significantly higher in the COVID-19 PCR positive group (p = 0.04). Thoracic computed tomography was performed in 42 patients. Testosterone levels were significantly lower in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (p = 0.01). When FSH, LH and testosterone values were separated as low, normal and high, there was no difference in FSH and LH values (p = 1, p = 0.2). Testosterone levels were found significantly lower in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (p < .001). Testosterone levels seem to decrease during acute COVID-19 infection, especially in the patient group with viral pneumonia.","Okçelik, Sezgin",Andrologia,331,20

Nevertheless, there are limited data on its feasibility, safety, and physiologic effects. The objective of our study was to assess the tolerability and safety of awake prone positioning in COVID-19 patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure. METHODS: This historical cohort study was performed across four hospitals in Calgary, Canada. Included patients had suspected COVID-19 and hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intensive care unit (ICU) consultation, and underwent awake prone positioning. The duration, frequency, tolerability, and adverse events from prone positioning were recorded. Respiratory parameters were assessed before, during, and after prone positioning. The primary outcome was the tolerability and safety of prone positioning. RESULTS: Seventeen patients (n = 12 ICU, n = 5 hospital ward) were included between April and May 2020. The median (range) number of prone positioning days was 1 (1-7) and the median number of sessions was 2 (1-6) per day. The duration of prone positioning was 75 (30-480) min, and the peripheral oxygen saturation was 91% (84-95) supine and 98% (92-100) prone. Limitations to prone position duration were pain/general discomfort (47%) and delirium (6%); 47% of patients had no limitations. Seven patients (41%) required intubation and two patients (12%) died. CONCLUSIONS: In a small sample, prone positioning non-intubated COVID-19 patients with severe hypoxemia was safe; however, many patients did not tolerate prolonged durations. Although patients had improved oxygenation and respiratory rate in the prone position, many still required intubation. Future studies are required to determine methods to improve the tolerability of awake prone positioning and whether there is an impact on clinical outcomes.","Solverson, Kevin; Weatherald, Jason; Parhar, Ken Kuljit S",Can. j. anaesth,331,21

The early kinetics and magnitude of these responses are, in some cases, associated with worse clinical outcomes in SARS and COVID-19. Cross-reactive hCoV antibody responses have been detected in both SARS and COVID-19 patients. There is also evidence that pre-existing T cell immunity to common cold coronaviruses can prime the response to SARS-CoV-2. Studies in non-human primates show that SARS-CoV-1 S-protein vaccine-induced antibodies are associated with acute lung injury in macaques challenged with SARS-CoV-1.

To increase the effectiveness of this orientation, I identified entrepreneurial resilience as an interactive variable. Research Design & Methods: The SPSS macro process program was used to test the study hypotheses by adopting questionnaire forms. These forms were utilised as a tool to collect data from a group of managers of the Southern Oil Company in Iraq. The study distributed 345 forms and received 308 valid forms for analysis. Findings: By testing a set of main and sub-hypotheses, the results showed the role of innovation capital in promoting sustainable entrepreneurial direction. This influence relationship increases with the presence of entrepreneurial resilience as an interactive variable. Implications & Recommendations: The results show the importance of personality traits in creating a sustainable entrepreneurial orientation. Nevertheless, it is important to focus on personal traits such as openness and acceptance by others, which enhance social relationships, because these relationships are significant in attracting or marketing ideas related to the environment. Contribution & Value Added: With the decline in the growth rates of countries and companies, especially with the Covid-19, it is expected that the rate of consumption of natural resources will increase. This increase helps to compensate for the losses and the decrease in profits. Thus, this study is important because it emphasizes the significance of production while maintaining principles of sustainability and requirements of preserving natural resources.","Nasser, W.

MethodsSerological responses were compared after BNT162b2 and AZD1222 vaccination with varying intervals in uninfected and previously-infected adults aged 50-89 years. These findings are evaluated against real-world national vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates against COVID-19 in England. ResultsWe recruited 750 participants aged 50-89 years, including 126 (16.8%) with evidence of previous infection; 421 received BNT162b2 and 329 and AZD1222. For both vaccines, over 95% had seroconverted 35-55 days after dose one, and 100% seroconverted 7+ days after dose 2. Following a 65-84 day interval between two doses, geometric mean titres (GMTs) at 14-34 days were 6-fold higher for BNT162b2 (6703; 95%CI, 5887-7633) than AZD1222 (1093; 806-1483), which in turn were higher than those receiving BNT162b2 19-29 days apart (694; 540 - 893). For both vaccines, VE was higher across all age-groups from 14 days after dose two compared to one dose, but the magnitude varied with interval between doses. Higher two-dose VE was observed with >6 week intervals between BNT162b2 doses compared to the authorised 3-week schedule, including [≥]80 year-olds. ConclusionOur findings support the UK approach of prioritising the first dose of COVID-19 vaccines, with evidence of higher protection following extended schedules. Given global vaccine constraints, these results are relevant to policymakers, especially with highly transmissible variants and rising incidence in many countries.

Objectives: Objectives: this review is to study the sirtuins involved in cancer, as well as SIRT1 inhibition studies in patients with coronavirus disease COVID-19. Data source and selection: For this, a search was made in Medline, Scopus and WOS, where descriptive studies of each of the functions of sirtuins were included, adjusted to recent scientific research. SIRT1 inhibition reduces CD8 T cell cytotoxicity in patients with systemic erythematosus lupus, being susceptible to SARS Cov-2 infections. SIRT2 is regulated by the secretion of IL-4 by eosinophils and the increase in SIRT2 increases hyperplasia, in contrast, SIRT3 promotes angiogenesis, inducing cardiac remodeling. SIRT4 is a tumor suppressor, in contrastto SIRT5 that promotes cell proliferation causing colorectal cancer; SIRT6 attenuates herpes virus associated with Kaposi's Sarcoma (KSHV) in immune compromised patients. Suppression of SIRT7 inhibits the growth of endometrial cancer cells. Conclusions: It is concluded that SIRT1, SIRT2 and SIRT4 are involved in the development of cancer, the suppression of SIRT5 and SIRT7 promotes the apoptosis of cancer cells and SIRT6 attenuates the replication of KSHV, in addition to the molecular pathology pathway of COVID-19 is associated with the inhibition of SIRT1 activity that may be related to inflammatory processes.","Huarachi Olivera, Ronald Eleazar; Lazarte Rivera, Antonio",Rev Fac Cien Med Univ Nac Cordoba,331,20

The pandemic is historic in scope and precedent given its emergence in an increasingly digital era. Importantly, there have been concerns about the accuracy of COVID-19 case counts due to issues such as lack of access to testing and difficulty in measuring recoveries. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to detect and characterize user-generated conversations that could be associated with COVID-19-related symptoms, experiences with access to testing, and mentions of disease recovery using an unsupervised machine learning approach. METHODS: Tweets were collected from the Twitter public streaming application programming interface from March 3-20, 2020, filtered for general COVID-19-related keywords and then further filtered for terms that could be related to COVID-19 symptoms as self-reported by users. Tweets were analyzed using an unsupervised machine learning approach called the biterm topic model (BTM), where groups of tweets containing the same word-related themes were separated into topic clusters that included conversations about symptoms, testing, and recovery. Tweets in these clusters were then extracted and manually annotated for content analysis and assessed for their statistical and geographic characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 4,492,954 tweets were collected that contained terms that could be related to COVID-19 symptoms. After using BTM to identify relevant topic clusters and removing duplicate tweets, we identified a total of 3465 (<1%) tweets that included user-generated conversations about experiences that users associated with possible COVID-19 symptoms and other disease experiences. These tweets were grouped into five main categories including first- and secondhand reports of symptoms, symptom reporting concurrent with lack of testing, discussion of recovery, confirmation of negative COVID-19 diagnosis after receiving testing, and users recalling symptoms and questioning whether they might have been previously infected with COVID-19. The co-occurrence of tweets for these themes was statistically significant for users reporting symptoms with a lack of testing and with a discussion of recovery. A total of 63% (n=1112) of the geotagged tweets were located in the United States. CONCLUSIONS: This study used unsupervised machine learning for the purposes of characterizing self-reporting of symptoms, experiences with testing, and mentions of recovery related to COVID-19. Many users reported symptoms they thought were related to COVID-19, but they were not able to get tested to confirm their concerns. In the absence of testing availability and confirmation, accurate case estimations for this period of the outbreak may never be known. Future studies should continue to explore the utility of infoveillance approaches to estimate COVID-19 disease severity.","Mackey, Tim; Purushothaman, Vidya; Li, Jiawei; Shah, Neal; Nali, Matthew; Bardier, Cortni; Liang, Bryan; Cai, Mingxiang; Cuomo, Raphael",JMIR Public Health Surveill,331,20

These were first isolated in humans as causal microorganisms responsible for common cold. The 2002-2003 SARS epidemic caused by SARS-CoV and 2012 MERS epidemic (64 countries affected) caused by MERS-CoV showed their acute and fatal side. These two CoV infections killed thousands of patients infected worldwide. However, WHO has still reported the MERS case in December 2019 in middle-eastern country (Saudi Arabia), indicating the MERS epidemic has not ended completely yet. Although we have not yet understood completely these two CoV epidemics, a third most dangerous and severe CoV infection has been originated in the Wuhan city, Hubei district of China in December 2019.

In macaques, the MVA/S vaccination induced strong neutralizing antibodies and CD8+ T cell responses, and conferred protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection and virus replication in the lungs as early as day 2 following intranasal and intratracheal challenge. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of lung cells on day 4 after infection revealed that MVA/S vaccination also protected macaques from infection-induced inflammation and B cell abnormalities and lowered induction of interferon-stimulated genes. These results demonstrate that MVA/S vaccination induces neutralizing antibodies and CD8+ T cells in the blood and lungs and is a potential vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2.","Routhu, Nanda Kishore; Cheedarla, Narayanaiah; Gangadhara, Sailaja; Bollimpelli, Venkata Satish; Boddapati, Arun K; Shiferaw, Ayalnesh; Rahman, Sheikh Abdul; Sahoo, Anusmita; Edara, Venkata Viswanadh; Lai, Lilin; Floyd, Katharine; Wang, Shelly; Fischinger, Stephanie; Atyeo, Caroline; Shin, Sally A; Gumber, Sanjeev; Kirejczyk, Shannon; Cohen, Joyce; Jean, Sherrie M; Wood, Jennifer S; Connor-Stroud, Fawn; Stammen, Rachelle L; Upadhyay, Amit A; Pellegrini, Kathryn; Montefiori, David; Shi, Pei-Yong; Menachery, Vineet D; Alter, Galit; Vanderford, Thomas H; Bosinger, Steven E; Suthar, Mehul S; Amara, Rama Rao",Immunity,331,26

Cardiac complications secondary to this infection are common; however, the underlying mechanisms of such remain unclear. A detailed cardiac evaluation of a series of COVID-19 individuals undergoing postmortem evaluation is provided, with four aims: 1) describe the pathologic spectrum of the myocardium; 2) compare to an alternate viral illness; 3) investigate angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression; and 4) provide the first description of the cardiac findings in patients with cleared infection. Methods: Study cases were identified from institutional files and included COVID-19 (n=15; 12 active, 3 cleared), influenza A/B (n=6), and non-virally mediated deaths (n=6). Salient information was abstracted from the medical record. Light microscopic findings were recorded. An ACE2 immunohistochemical H-score was compared across cases. Viral detection encompassed SARS-CoV-2 immunohistochemistry, ultrastructural examination, and droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). Results: Male sex was more common in the COVID-19 group (p=0.05). Non-occlusive fibrin microthrombi (without ischemic injury) were identified in 16 cases (12 COVID-19, 2 influenza, and 2 controls), and were more common in the active COVID-19 cohort (p=0.006). Four active COVID-19 cases showed focal myocarditis, while one case of cleared COVID-19 showed extensive disease. Arteriolar ACE2 endothelial expression was lower in COVID-19 cases versus controls (p=0.004). ACE2 myocardial expression did not differ by disease category, sex, age or number of patient comorbidities (p=0.69, p=1.00, p=0.46, p=0.65, respectively). SARS-CoV-2 immunohistochemistry showed non-specific staining, while ultrastructural examination and ddPCR were negative for viral presence. Four (26.7%) COVID-19 patients had underlying cardiac amyloidosis. Cases with cleared infection had variable presentations. Conclusions: This detailed histopathologic, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural and molecular cardiac series showed no definitive evidence of direct myocardial infection. COVID-19 cases frequently have cardiac fibrin microthrombi, without universal acute ischemic injury. Moreover, myocarditis is present in 33.3% of active and cleared COVID-19 patients, but is usually limited in extent. Histologic features of resolved infection are variable. Cardiac amyloidosis may be an additional risk factor for severe disease.","Bois, Melanie C; Boire, Nicholas A; Layman, Andrew J; Aubry, Marie-Christine; Alexander, Mariam P; Roden, Anja C; Hagen, Catherine E; Quinton, Reade A; Larsen, Christopher; Erben, Young; Majumdar, Ramanath; Jenkins, Sarah M; Kipp, Benjamin R; Lin, Peter T; Maleszewski, Joseph J",Circulation,331,20

METHODS: It's a retrospective study during two mounths in a hospital that admit pediatric COVID-19 cases. We included patients diagnosed with staphylococcus aureus necrotizing pneumonia admitted to the intensive care unit. RESULTS: 4 patients were included with a mean age of 13 years old. All of them were suspected initially of COVID-19, this diagnosis has been ruled out by negative RT-PCR of SARSCOV2. They all were previously healty and had an influenza-like prodrome, who progress to septic shock and respiratory failure. Two children presented septic arthritis. Blood cultures were always positives to methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus. The RT-PCR for the gene encoding the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) was positive in one case and is in progress for the others due to unavailability in our institution. Chest-CT revealed always bilateral pneumonias with disseminated nodules, it's associated with pleural effusions in 2 cases. The laboratory finding revealed thrombocytopenia 84100+/-24900/μL, hyperleucocytosis 20800+/-7400/μL and elevated CRP 327+/-51 mg/dL. All the patients were under norepinephrine infusion, three of them needed invasive ventilation. The fatal outcome was deplored in two cases. CONCLUSIONS: Staphylococcus aureus is a rare cause of severe pneumonia that can be confused with COVID-19. It's associated with a high case mortality especially the PVL strain. Despite COVID-19 pandemic, the medical staff attention should also be focused on other emerging infectious disease.","Berdai, M.

We are proposing the CEdRIC strategy as a practical, straightforward protocol that meets patient education and health psychology science requirements. The main goal of the CEdRIC process is to give patients self-management strategies aimed at preventing complications and disease transmission. The COVID-19 pandemic is challenging clinicians to rapidly teach their patients self-management strategies while managing the inherent pressures of this emergency situation. The CEdRIC strategy is designed to deliver key information to patients and standardize the discharge process. CEdRIC is currently being tested at triage centres in Belgium.

However, this approach can suffer from a series of methodological issues with respect to sampling biases and measurement error. To date, it has not been validated if social media sentiment can measure the day to day temporal dynamics of emotions aggregated at the macro level of a whole online community. We ran a large-scale survey at an online newspaper to gather daily self-reports of affective states from its users and compare these with aggregated results of sentiment analysis of user discussions on the same online platform. Additionally, we preregistered a replication of our study using Twitter text as a macroscope of emotions for the same community. For both platforms, we find strong correlations between text analysis results and levels of self-reported emotions, as well as between inter-day changes of both measurements. We further show that a combination of supervised and unsupervised text analysis methods is the most accurate approach to measure emotion aggregates.

The highly oxidizing, charge-separated state generated within its reaction center (RC) drives water oxidation. Spectroscopic studies on PS II RCs are difficult to interpret due to large spectral congestion, necessitating modeling to elucidate key spectral features. Herein, we present results from time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations on the largest PS II RC model reported to date. This model explicitly includes six RC chromophores and both the chlorin phytol chains and the amino acid residues <6 Å from the pigments' porphyrin ring centers. Comparing our wild-type model results with calculations on mutant D1-His-198-Ala and D2-His-197-Ala RCs, our simulated absorption-difference spectra reproduce experimentally observed shifts in known chlorophyll absorption bands, demonstrating the predictive capabilities of this model. We find that inclusion of both nearby residues and phytol chains is necessary to reproduce this behavior. Our calculations provide a unique opportunity to observe the molecular orbitals that contribute to the excited states that are precursors to CS. Strikingly, we observe two high oscillator strength, low-lying states, in which molecular orbitals are delocalized over ChlD1 and PheD1 as well as one weaker oscillator strength state with molecular orbitals delocalized over the P chlorophylls. Both these configurations are a match for previously identified exciton-charge transfer states (ChlD1 +PheD1 -)* and (PD2 +PD1 -)*. Our results demonstrate the power of TDDFT as a tool, for studies of natural photosynthesis, or indeed future studies of artificial photosynthetic complexes.","Kavanagh, Maeve A; Karlsson, Joshua K G; Colburn, Jonathan D; Barter, Laura M C; Gould, Ian R",Proc.

This situation has had a major impact on clinical laboratories that have attempted to answer the urgent need for diagnostic tools, since the identification of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Development of a reliable serological diagnostic immunoassay, with high levels of sensitivity and specificity to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with improved differential diagnosis from other circulating viruses, is mandatory. METHODS: An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using whole inactivated virus cultured in vitro, was developed to detect viral antigens. WB and ELISA investigations were carried out with sera of convalescent patients and negative sera samples. Both analyses were concurrently performed with recombinant MABs to verify the findings. RESULTS: Preliminary data from 10 sera (5 patients with COVID-19, and 5 healthy controls) using this immunoassay are very promising, successfully identifying all of the confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals. CONCLUSION: This ELISA appears to be a specific and reliable method for detecting COVID-19 antibodies (IgG, IgM, and IgA), and a useful tool for identifying individuals which have developed immunity to the virus.","Cerutti, Helena; Ricci, Veronica; Tesi, Giulia; Soldatini, Claudia; Castria, Marinunzia; Vaccaro, Marco Natale; Tornesi, Stefania; Toppi, Simona; Verdiani, Silvana; Brogi, Alessandra",J Clin Lab Anal,331,1

It will augment previously published small series of autopsy case reports, refine clinicopathologic considerations, and improve the accuracy of future vital statistical reporting. OBJECTIVE: To accurately reflect the pre-existing diseases and pathologic conditions of decedents with Sars-CoV-2 infection through autopsy. DESIGN: Comprehensive data from 135 autopsy evaluations of COVID-19-positive decedents is presented, including histologic assessment. Postmortem examinations were performed by 36 pathologists at 19 medical centers or forensic institutions in the United States and Brazil. Data from each autopsy were collected through the online submission of multiple choice and openended survey responses. RESULTS: Patients dying of or with COVID-19 had an average of 8.89 pathologic conditions documented at autopsy, spanning a combination of prior chronic disease and acute conditions acquired during hospitalization. Virtually all decedents were cited as having more than one preexisting condition, encompassing an average of 2.88 such diseases each. Clinical conditions during terminal hospitalization were cited 395 times for the 135 autopsied decedents and predominantly encompassed acute failure of multiple organ systems and/or impaired coagulation. Myocarditis was rarely cited. CONCLUSIONS: Cause-of-death statements in both autopsy reports and death certificates may not encompass the severity or spectrum of co-morbid conditions in those dying of or with COVID-19. If supported by additional research, this finding may have implications for public health decisions and reporting moving forward through the pandemic.","Hooper, Jody E; Padera, Robert F; Dolhnikoff, Marisa; da Silva, Luiz Fernando Ferraz; Duarte-Neto, Amaro Nunes; Kapp, Meghan E; Lacy, J Matthew; Mauad, Thais; Nascimento Saldiva, Paulo Hilario; Rapkiewicz, Amy V; Wolf, Dwayne A; Felix, Juan C; Benson, Paul; de Almeida Monteiro, Renata Aparecida; Shanes, Elisheva; Gawelek, Kara L; Marshall, Desiree A; McDonald, Michelle M; Muller, William; Priemer, David S; Solomon, Isaac H; Zak, Taylor; Bhattacharjee, Meenakshi B; Fu, Lucy; Gilbert, Andrea R; Harper, Holly L; Litovsky, Silvio; Lomasney, Jon; Mount, Sharon L; Reilly, Stephanie; Sekulic, Miroslav; Steffensen, Thora S; Threlkeld, Kirsten J; Zhao, Bihong; Williamson, Alex K",Arch. pathol. lab. med.

Instead, vaccine-specific PCR provides a convenient tool to detect vaccine-like virus from a sample. Here we report the development and validation of a real-time RT-PCR specific for PRRSGard® , a newly available commercial PRRSV-2 MLV vaccine. Analytical specificity, sensitivity, and diagnostic performance of PRRSGard PCR were evaluated and compared to a commercial PRRSV screening PCR (reference PCR). PRRSGard and reference PCRs did not cross-react with any of the 27 non-PRRSV swine pathogens. PRRSGard PCR did not cross-react with other PRRSV-2 vaccine viruses and 31 laboratory and field PRRSV-2 isolates representing various genetic lineages of PRRSV-2. PRRSGard and reference PCRs consistently detected up to 10-6 and 10-5 dilutions of PRRSGard vaccine virus, respectively. Based on testing serial dilutions of in vitro transcribed RNA, the 95% limit of detection of PRRSGard PCR was 16 genomic copies/reaction with CT cut-off value of 36 and 7 genomic copies/reaction with CT cut-off value of 37. Diagnostic performance of PRRSGard PCR was evaluated using 846 clinical samples (684 serum and 162 oral fluid samples). Compared to the reference screening PCR, diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and agreement of PRRSGard PCR were 95.34%, 98.85%, and 97.52% with cut-off CT value of 36 and 98.14%, 96.56%, and 97.16% with cut-off CT value of 37. In addition, PRRSGard PCR was able to detect PRRSGard vaccine virus in a sample even with the co-presence of another PRRSV strain. In summary, in contrast to a reference screening PCR that detects both vaccine and field PRRSV strains, PRRSGard PCR provides a convenient tool to specifically detect PRRSGard vaccine-like virus and to inform PRRSV vaccination protocols.","Rawal, Gaurav; Yim-Im, Wannarat; Chamba, Fabian; Smith, Chad; Okones, Jeff; Francisco, Charles; Zhang, Jianqiang",Transbound. emerg. dis.

Beyond these features, PsA is associated with comorbidities that might increase the burden of the disease. AREAS COVERED: In the last years a growing interest has come out for the concept of multimorbidity in rheumatology. Multimorbidity was defined as the 'co-existence of two or more chronic diseases in the same individual.' In the multimorbidity concept, the patient is of central concern and all coexisting diseases are of equal importance. Comorbidity was defined as the 'occurrence of any distinct additional entity during the clinical course of patient who has the index disease under study.' In PsA, comorbidity and multimorbidity have often been confusingly used interchangeably, showing that there is an unmet need on this topic. EXPERT OPINION: This perspective article dealt with these different visions of the co-existence of other diseases in PsA, providing a distinction between them, not only for the impact on the treatment decision but also in how this concept might be incorporated into clinical trials design, choosing the right outcome measures for the patient-centric concept of multimorbidity. For this perspective, the authors searched PubMed and the Cochrane library for articles published.","Lubrano, Ennio; Scriffignano, Silvia; Perrotta, Fabio Massimo",Expert Rev Clin Immunol,331,16

OBJECTIVE: As medical students are professionals in training and have a high level of responsibility in terms of handling the emotional and physical aspects of several diseases, this study aims to evaluate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and participation in the MPII study on the educational routines and mental health of medical students. METHODS: A web-based survey was carried out to perform a cross-sectional comparative assessment of medical students who participated in the MPII study and their colleagues who were not involved in the MPII study. Participants from both groups were matched based on sex, age, and medical school. The web questionnaire was developed by a panel composed of graduate medical students, rheumatologists, medical school professors, and a psychology professor. The questionnaire included details on demographic and life habits data and evaluated participants' impressions of the MPII study and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their educational routines and medical training. In addition, depression, anxiety, and stress were evaluated using the Brazilian version of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS)-21, and currently, the DASS-21 scores are grouped as those that indicate a low, moderate, or high risk of mental distress. This project was approved by the Federal University of São Paulo Ethics Committee (CAAE: 34034620.0.0000.5505). RESULTS: Data were collected from both medical student groups from July 20 to August 31, 2020. Data extraction was completed in September 2020. The data analysis is ongoing. We expect the results to be published in the first semester of 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide insight into the effects of participating in a research project on depression, anxiety, and stress, which will be determined by applying the DASS-21 to a large sample of Brazilian undergraduate medical students. We will also evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical students' educational routines and medical training.

Barriers include, but are not limited to, the paucity of test norms, uncertainty about the equivalence of translated neuropsychological tests, and limited proficiency in the provision of culturally competent services. Similar issues generalize to telephone- and video-based administration of neuropsychological tests or teleneuropsychology (TeleNP) with Hispanics/Latinos (as), and few studies have examined its feasibility and validity in this group. The sudden onset of the COVID-19 pandemic prompted neuropsychologists to identify alternative ways to provide equitable care. Clinicians providing TeleNP to this population during (and after) the pandemic must consider safety, professional factors, and systemic barriers to accessing and benefitting from virtual modalities. METHOD: This clinical process manuscript describes how cross-cultural neuropsychologists across five U.S. academic institutions serving Hispanics/Latinos (as) developed TeleNP models of care during the pandemic. RESULTS: Workflows, test batteries, and resources for TeleNP assessment with monolingual and bilingual Spanish-speaking patients are included. Factors guiding model development and informing decisions to incorporate virtual administration of neuropsychological tests into their practice are also discussed.

The model (called SIARD) is given by a system of differential equations which model the interactions between five populations ""susceptible"", ""reported infectious"", ""unreported infectious"", ""recovered with/without non total immunity"" and ""death"". Depending on the basic reproduction number, we prove that the total immunity induces local stability-instability of equilibria and the epidemic may disappear after a first epidemic wave and more epidemic waves may appear in the case of non-total immunity. Using the sensitivity analysis we identify the most sensitive parameters. Numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate our theoretical results. As an application, we found that our model fits well the Moroccan epidemic wave, and predicts more than one wave for French case.","Aziz-Alaoui, M.

In this paper, we examine some of the major challenges that are being faced by teacher educators as they prepare for September 2020, struggling to re-imagine teaching and learning remotely. We also examine the issues facing teacher education using the lens of ‘complex adaptive systems’, systems that are unpredictable, have many interacting parts, and are characterised by constant uncertainty both from within and particularly from outside. Some issues affecting teacher education and teacher educators causing this uncertainty in Ontario include 1) access to effective online connection and support, 2) educator professional development for online learning, 3) conversion of face-to-face courses to successful online courses, and 4) the recognition of student teachers’ practica experiences. Although this article provides a snapshot of the Ontario context and the challenges it currently faces in teacher education, it also presents some solutions, and by thinking of the context as an example of a complex adaptive system, it also holds out hope for the future.","Van Nuland, Shirley; Mandzuk, David; Tucker Petrick, Krista; Cooper, Terri",J.

The ubiquitous availability of sequence data, allows us to predict epitopes from sequence in order to focus time-consuming wet-lab experiments towards the most promising epitope regions. Here, we extend our previously developed sequence-based predictors for homodimer and heterodimer PPI interfaces to predict epitope residues that have the potential to bind an antibody. RESULTS: We collected and curated a high quality epitope dataset from the SAbDab database. Our generic PPI heterodimer predictor obtained an AUC-ROC of 0.666 when evaluated on the epitope test set. We then trained a random forest model specifically on the epitope dataset, reaching AUC 0.694. Further training on the combined heterodimer and epitope datasets, improves our final predictor to AUC 0.703 on the epitope test set. This is better than the best state-of-the-art sequence-based epitope predictor BepiPred-2.0. On one solved antibody-antigen structure of the COVID19 virus spike RNA binding domain, our predictor reaches AUC 0.778. We added the SeRenDIP-CE Conformational Epitope predictors to our webserver, which is simple to use and only requires a single antigen sequence as input, which will help make the method immediately applicable in a wide range of biomedical and biomolecular research.

Patients were followed up at 2, 6, and 12?weeks. Twenty-eight patients required fistula creation twice, 16 patients thrice, and two patients underwent fistula creation four times. Of the total, 259 (68.8%) fistulae were radio-cephalic while 99 (26.3%) and 18 (4.79%) were brachio-cephalic and brachio-basilic, respectively. A total of 207 (67%) patients were already on hemodialysis whereas 103 (33%) were planned for elective initiation after fistula maturation. Of the 211 (69%) patients who completed 3?months of follow-up, 31 (15%) expired and 7 (3.3%) were lost to follow-up. Primary failure was observed in 70 (33.2%) fistulae. Fifteen (7.1%) patients were noted to be COVID positive during the follow-up. A total of 279 (90%) patients were alive at last follow-up.

Perceived susceptibility and severity are considered key elements that motivate people to adopt non-pharmaceutical interventions. This study aimed to i) explore perceived susceptibility and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, ii) examine the practice of non-pharmaceutical interventions, and iii) assess the potential association of perceived COVID-19 susceptibility and severity with the practice of non-pharmaceutical interventions among people living in Afghanistan. METHODS: A cross-sectional design was employed, using online surveys disseminated from April to May 2020. Convenience sampling was used to recruit the participants of this study. The previously developed scales were used to assess the participants' demographic information, perceived risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and perceived severity of COVID-19. Multivariate analyses were conducted to assess the potential association of perceived COVID-19 susceptibility and severity with the practice of non-pharmaceutical interventions. RESULTS: The internet was the main source for obtaining COVID-19 information among participants in this study. While 45.8% of the participants believed it was ""very unlikely"" for them to get infected with COVID-19, 76.7% perceived COVID-19 as a severe disease. Similarly, 37.5% believed the chance of being cured if infected with COVID-19 is ""unlikely/very unlikely"". The majority of participants (95.6%) perceived their health to be in ""good"" and ""very good"" status. Overall, 74.2% mentioned that they stopped visiting public places, 49.7% started using gloves, and 70.4% started wearing a mask. Participants who believed they have a low probability of survival if infected with COVID-19 were more likely to wear masks and practice hand washing. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that communities' psychological and behavioral responses were affected by the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Afghanistan, especially among young internet users. The findings gained from a timely behavioral assessment of the community might be useful to develop interventions and risk communication strategies in epidemics within and beyond COVID-19.","Mousavi, Sayed Hamid; Delshad, Mohammad Hossein; Acuti Martellucci, Cecilia; Bhandari, Divya; Ozaki, Akihiko; Pourhaji, Fatemeh; Pourhaji, Fahimeh; Reza Hosseini, Sayed Mohammad; Roien, Rohullah; Ramozi, Abass Ali; Wafaee, Marzia; Qaderi, Shohra; Delsoz, Mohammad; Sigdel, Shailendra; Kotera, Yasuhiro; Sawano, Toyoaki; Dhama, Kuldeep; Rodríguez-Morales, Alfonso J; Wang, Jiwei; Tanimoto, Tetsuya; Yousofi, Ali Ahmad; Sah, Ranjit",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,331,22

Currently, most government efforts seek to avoid disseminating the coronavirus and forecast probable hot areas. The most susceptible to coronaviral infection are the healthcare staff due to their daily contact with potential patients. This article proposes a COVID-19 real-time system for tracking and identifying the suspected cases using an Internet of Things platform for capturing user symptoms and notify the authority. The proposed framework addressed four main components: (1) real-time symptom data collection via thermal scanning algorithm, (2) facial recognition algorithm, (3) a data analysis that uses artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm, and (4) a cloud infrastructure. A monitoring experiment was conducted to test three different ages, kid, middle, and older, considering the scanning distance influence compared with contact wearable sensors. The results show that 99.9% accuracy was achieved within a (500 ± 5) cm distance, and this accuracy tends to decrease as the distance the camera scanning and objects increased. The results also revealed that the scanning system's accuracy had been slightly changed as the environmental temperature dropped lower than 27 °C. Based on the high-temperature presence's simulated environment, the system demonstrated an effective and instant response via sending email and MQTT message to the person in charge of providing accurate identification of potential cases of COVID-19. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Al-Humairi, S.

METHODS: Using an individual-based model, we simulated the spread of COVID-19 in Daegu. An individual can be infected through close contact with infected people in a household, at work/school, and at religious and social gatherings. We created a synthetic population from census sample data. Then, 9,000 people were randomly selected from the entire population of Daegu and set as members of the Shincheonji Church. We did not take into account population movements to and from other regions in Korea. RESULTS: Using the individual-based model, the cumulative confirmed cases in Daegu through March 26, 2020, were reproduced, and it was confirmed that the hotspot, i.e., the Shincheonji Church had a different probability of infection than non-hotspot, i.e., the Daegu community. For 3 scenarios (I: school closing, II: school opening after April 6, III: school opening after April 6 and the mean period from symptom onset to hospitalization increasing to 4.3 days), we predicted future changes in the pattern of COVID-19 spread in Daegu. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to scenario I, it was found that in scenario III, the cumulative number of patients would increase by 107 and the date of occurrence of the last patient would be delayed by 92 days.","Son, Woo-Sik",Epidemiol Health,331,25

The influence of meteorological factors on the transmission and spread of COVID-19 is of interest. This study sought to examine the associations of daily average temperature (AT) and relative humidity (ARH) with the daily counts of COVID-19 cases in 30 Chinese provinces (in Hubei from December 1, 2019 to February 11, 2020 and in other provinces from January 20, 2020 to Februarys 11, 2020). A Generalized Additive Model (GAM) was fitted to quantify the province-specific associations between meteorological variables and the daily cases of COVID-19 during the study periods. In the model, the 14-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) of AT and ARH, and their interaction were included with time trend and health-seeking behavior adjusted. Their spatial distributions were visualized. AT and ARH showed significantly negative associations with COVID-19 with a significant interaction between them (0.04, 95% confidence interval: 0.004-0.07) in Hubei. Every 1 °C increase in the AT led to a decrease in the daily confirmed cases by 36% to 57% when ARH was in the range from 67% to 85.5%. Every 1% increase in ARH led to a decrease in the daily confirmed cases by 11% to 22% when AT was in the range from 5.04 °C to 8.2 °C. However, these associations were not consistent throughout Mainland China.","Qi, Hongchao; Xiao, Shuang; Shi, Runye; Ward, Michael P; Chen, Yue; Tu, Wei; Su, Qing; Wang, Wenge; Wang, Xinyi; Zhang, Zhijie",Sci Total Environ,331,14

We discussed how the traveler case reports could aid in a timely detection of a disease outbreak. Methods: Using the traveler data, we estimated a few indicators of the epidemic that affected decision making and policy, including the exponential growth rate, the doubling time, and the probability of severe cases exceeding the hospital capacity, in the initial phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in multiple countries. We imputed the arrival dates when they were missing. We compared the estimates from the traveler data to the ones from domestic data. We quantitatively evaluated the influence of each case report and knowing the arrival date on the estimation. Findings: We estimated the travel origin's daily exponential growth rate and examined the date from which the growth rate was consistently above 0.1 (equivalent to doubling time<7 days). We found those dates were very close to the dates that critical decisions were made such as city lock-downs and national emergency announcement. Using only the traveler data, if the assumed epidemic start date was relatively accurate and the traveler sample was representative of the general population, the growth rate estimated from the traveler data was consistent with the domestic data. We also discussed situations that the traveler data could lead to biased estimates. From the data influence study, we found more recent travel cases had a larger influence on each day's estimate, and the influence of each case report got smaller as more cases became available. We provided the minimum number of exported cases needed to determine whether the local epidemic growth rate was above a certain level, and developed a user-friendly Shiny App to accommodate various scenarios.","Bao, Le; Zhang, Ying; Niu, Xiaoyue",,331,5

The first period, the 'social crisis,' extended over thirteen weeks in late 2019 into early 2020 due to protests over income inequality and the government response to social unrest. The second period, the 'health crisis,' began in March 2020 with Chile's first case of COVID-19 and escalated rapidly to include 'stay at home orders,' traffic restrictions, and the shuttering of most businesses. We wished to evaluate the impact of these crisis periods on trauma epidemiology. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of the South-East Metropolitan Health Service Trauma Registry. Trauma admissions, operative volume, and in-hospital mortality were evaluated during the crisis period and the year prior. RESULTS: The social crisis saw increased levels of trauma, both blunt and penetrating, relative to the time period immediately preceding. The health crisis saw an increase in penetrating trauma with a concomitant decline in blunt trauma. Both crisis periods had decreased levels of trauma, overall, compared to the year prior. There were no statistically significant differences in in-hospital trauma mortality. CONCLUSION: Different crises may have different patterns of trauma. Crisis periods that include extended periods of lockdown and curfew may lead to increasing penetrating trauma volume.

METHOD: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between October 1 and December 1, 2020, in Iran. The study population consisted of patients who used the service. Three hundred-ninety-six patients were enrolled in the study by convenience sampling. Data were collected by a researcher-made questionnaire. The face, comprehensibility, and content validity of the questionnaire were tested and met. The reliability of this questionnaire was confirmed (r = 0.9). Descriptive statistics and multinomial logistic regression were conducted. Data were analyzed using STATA 14.0 software. RESULTS: In total, 396 patients responded to the online questionnaire. The mean age of patients was 37 ± 10.31 years. More than half of them had an academic degree (65.40 %). Teleconsultation was considered satisfactory by 172 patients (43.43 %), while more than half of the patients (56.57 %) were unsatisfied with teleconsultation. In terms of ""quality of care provided"" and ""patient information privacy"" components, around 41 % of patients were satisfied. However, the number of patients who feel satisfied with teleconsultation's similarity to a face-to-face encounter was lower (37.88 %). The results showed no significant relationship between age, gender, education, and overall satisfaction (p > 0.05). The association between overall satisfaction and health status was (AOR = 1.51, 95 % CI = 1.16-1.96). CONCLUSION: More than half of patients from our study did not have a good experience with teleconsultation.

While there have been indications that precaution fatigue could be a key factor, no scientific evidence has been provided so far. We used a stochastic metapopulation model with a hierarchical structure and fitted the model to the positive cases in the US from the start of outbreak to the end of 2020. We incorporated non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) into this model by assuming that the precaution strength grows with positive cases and studied two types of pandemic fatigue. We found that people in most states and in the whole US respond to the outbreak in a sublinear manner (with exponent k=0.5), while only three states (Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey) have linear reaction (k=1). Case fatigue (decline in people's vigilance to positive cases) is responsible for 58% of cases, while precaution fatigue (decay of maximal fraction of vigilant group) accounts for 26% cases. If there were no pandemic fatigue (no case fatigue and no precaution fatigue), total positive cases would have reduced by 68% on average. Our study shows that pandemic fatigue is the major cause of the worsening situation of COVID-19 in United States. Reduced vigilance is responsible for most positive cases, and higher mortality rate tends to push local people to react to the outbreak faster and maintain vigilant for longer time.","Tang, Disheng; Cao, Wei; Bian, Jiang; Liu, Tie-Yan; Gao, Zhifeng; Zheng, Shun; Liu, Jue",,331,15

Here we show that the histone methyltransferase DOT1L, which marks the nucleosome core on active genes, safeguards normal differentiation of CD8+ T cells. T cell-specific ablation of Dot1L resulted in loss of naïve CD8+ T cells and premature differentiation toward a memory-like state, independent of antigen exposure and in a cell-intrinsic manner. Mechanistically, DOT1L controlled CD8+ T cell differentiation by ensuring normal T cell receptor density and signaling. DOT1L also maintained epigenetic identity, in part by indirectly supporting the repression of developmentally regulated genes. Finally, deletion of Dot1L in T cells resulted in an impaired immune response. Through our study, DOT1L is emerging as a central player in physiology of CD8+ T cells, acting as a barrier to prevent premature differentiation and controlling epigenetic integrity.","Kwesi-Maliepaard, Eliza Mari; Aslam, Muhammad Assad; Alemdehy, Mir Farshid; van den Brand, Teun; McLean, Chelsea; Vlaming, Hanneke; van Welsem, Tibor; Korthout, Tessy; Lancini, Cesare; Hendriks, Sjoerd; Ahrends, Tomasz; van Dinther, Dieke; den Haan, Joke M M; Borst, Jannie; de Wit, Elzo; van Leeuwen, Fred; Jacobs, Heinz",Proc.

Identifying indicators of hospital admission for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients early in the disease course could aid the efficient allocation of medical interventions. Self-reported olfactory impairment has recently been recognized as a hallmark of COVID-19 and may be an important predictor of clinical outcome. METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients presenting to a San Diego Hospital system with laboratory-confirmed positive COVID-19 infection was conducted with evaluation of olfactory and gustatory function and clinical disease course. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were performed to identify risk factors for hospital admission and anosmia. RESULTS: A total of 169 patients tested positive for COVID-19 disease between March 3 and April 8, 2020. Olfactory and gustatory data were obtained for 128 (75.7%) of 169 subjects, of which 26 (20.1%) of 128 required hospitalization. Admission for COVID-19 was associated with intact sense of smell and taste, increased age, diabetes, and subjective and objective parameters associated with respiratory failure. On adjusted analysis, anosmia was strongly and independently associated with outpatient care (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01-0.74), whereas positive findings of pulmonary infiltrates and/or pleural effusion on chest radiograph (aOR 8.01; 95% CI, 1.12-57.49) was strongly and independently associated with admission. CONCLUSION: Normosmia is an independent predictor of admission in COVID-19 cases. Smell loss in COVID-19 may be associated with a milder clinical course.","Yan, Carol H; Faraji, Farhoud; Prajapati, Divya P; Ostrander, Benjamin T; DeConde, Adam S",Int Forum Allergy Rhinol,331,1

Depending on their fitness, these mutants either become extinct or thrive, spawning variants that escape the immune system. The most important SARS-CoV-2 mutations are those that alter the amino acid sequence in the viral S protein because this protein holds the key for the virus to enter the human cell. The more viruses replicate, the more they mutate, and the more likely it is that dominant resistant variants will appear. In such cases, more stringent measures for community protection will be required. Vaccines and polyclonal antibodies, which induce a response directed towards several sites along the S protein, would maintain effective protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Furthermore, vaccines appear to induce an increased helper and cytotoxic T-cell response, which may also be a biomarker of protection. In densely populated areas with insufficient protection measures, the virus spreads freely, thus increasing the likelihood of generating escape mutants. India and Manaus exemplify this situation. Natural evolution selects the mutants that multiply most efficiently without eliminating the host, thus facilitating their spread. Contrastingly, the circulation of viruses of high virulence and lethality (Ebola, hantavirus) that eliminate the host remain limited to certain geographic areas, without further dissemination. Therefore, it would be expected that SARS-CoV-2 will evolve into more infectious and less virulent variants.","Kantor, I. N.; Luthy, I. A.; Ritacco, V.",Medicina,331,2

To that end we exposed human peripheral blood mononuclear cells to 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/mL of yellow gentian root extract (YGRE) to determine its effects on oxidative stress parameters [pro/antioxidant balance (PAB) and lipid peroxidation], DNA damage (alkaline comet assay and chromosome aberrations), and cell viability (trypan blue exclusion test). Cell viability decreased with increasing concentrations and treatment duration. Only the lowest YGRE concentration (0.5 mg/mL) increased oxidative stress but produced minor DNA damage and cytotoxicity. At higher concentrations, redox parameters returned to near control values. The percentage of chromosome aberrations and percentage of DNA in the comet tail increased with increased YGRE concentration after 48 h and declined after 72 h of treatment. This points to the activation of DNA repair mechanism (homologous recombination), evidenced by the formation of chromosomal radial figures after 72 h of treatment with the highest YGRE concentration of 2 mg/mL. Our results suggest that YGRE, despite induction of cytotoxic and genotoxic effects, activates cell repair mechanisms that counter oxidative and DNA lesions and induce cell death in highly damaged cells. Therefore, observed protective effects of yellow gentian after longer exposure could be a result of activated repair and removal of cells with irreparable damage.","Sobot, Ana Valenta; Drakulic, Dunja; Joksic, Gordana; Vukajlovic, Jadranka Miletic; Savic, Jasmina; Potocnik, Jelena; Trickovic, Jelena Filipovic",Arh Hig Rada Toksikol,331,16

The presence of depressive symptoms, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), perceived loneliness and spiritual well-being were evaluated. Linear mixed models with random slopes were calculated for each variable in the study in order to analyse the effect of longitudinal measures and interaction with gender. Women showed more symptoms of depression, anxiety and PTSD, more feelings of loneliness and less spiritual well-being compared to men. The psychological impact caused by the pandemic is maintained over time and increases for depression. Covid-19 appears to be having a greater psychological impact on women than men.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of COVID-19 among youth soccer athletes and the risk mitigation practices utilized by youth soccer organizations. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. PARTICIPANTS: Youth soccer club directors throughout the United States. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Surveys were completed in late August 2020 regarding phase of return to soccer (individual only, group non-contact, group contact), date of reinitiation, number of players, cases of COVID-19, and risk reduction procedures being implemented. Case and incidence rates were compared to national pediatric data and county data from the prior 10 weeks. A negative binomial regression model was developed to predict club COVID-19 cases with local incidence rate and phase of return as covariates and the log of club player-days as an offset. RESULTS: 124 respondents had reinitiated soccer, representing 91,007 players with a median duration of 73 days (IQR: 53-83 days) since restarting. Of the 119 that had progressed to group activities, 218 cases of COVID-19 were reported among 85,861 players. Youth soccer players had a lower case rate and incidence rate than children in the US (254 v. 477 cases per 100,000; incidence rate ratio [IRR]=0.511, 95% CI = [0.40-0.57], p<0.001) and the general population from the counties where data was available (268 v. 864 cases per 100,000; IRR=0.202 [0.19-0.21], p<0.001). After adjusting for local COVID-19 incidence, there was no relationship between club COVID-19 incidence and phase of return (non-contact: b=0.35±0.67, p=0.61; contact: b=0.18±0.67, p=0.79). Soccer clubs reported utilizing a median of 8 (IQR: 6-10) risk reduction procedures. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of COVID-19 among youth soccer athletes is relatively low when compared to the background incidence among children in the United States in summer of 2020. No relationship was identified between club COVID-19 incidence and phase of return to soccer.","Watson, Andrew M; Haraldsdottir, Kristin; Biese, Kevin; Goodavish, Leslie; Stevens, Bethany; McGuine, Timothy",J. athl. train,331,26

Thirty-five articles with 8,170 patients were included, and all the available studies were case series. The pooled odds ratio for the development of severe COVID-19 was 3.21 for patients with CHD (fixed-effects model, 95% CI: 2.58-3.99), 2.27 for patients with hypertension (random-effects model, 95% CI: 1.79-2.90) and 2.34 for patients with diabetes (random-effects model, 95% CI: 1.79-3.05). The heterogeneity of the studies was moderate for the effect of CHD on COVID-19 severity, but was high for the effects of diabetes and hypertension. Funnel plots and Egger's tests revealed no publication bias in the CHD and hypertension analyses, but suggested publication bias in the diabetes analysis. This bias was corrected using the trim-and-fill method, and was ultimately found to have no effect on the results. Our findings suggest patients with CHD, hypertension and diabetes are at greater risk for developing severe COVID-19 than those without these conditions.","Meng, Meng; Zhao, Qianwen; Kumar, Rahul; Bai, Chen; Deng, Yunlei; Wan, Bo",Aging (Albany NY),331,16

Despite ODE's wide usage in modeling, the frequent absence of their analytic solutions makes it challenging to estimate ODE parameters from the data, especially when the model has lots of variables and parameters. This paper proposes a Bayesian ODE parameter estimating algorithm which is fast and accurate even for models with many parameters. The proposed method approximates an ODE model with a state-space model based on equations of a numeric solver. It allows fast estimation by avoiding computations of a complete numerical solution in the likelihood. The posterior is obtained by a variational Bayes method, more specifically, the approximate Riemannian conjugate gradient method (Honkela et al. 2010), which avoids samplings based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In simulation studies, we compared the speed and performance of the proposed method with existing methods. The proposed method showed the best performance in the reproduction of the true ODE curve with strong stability as well as the fastest computation, especially in a large model with more than 30 parameters. As a real-world data application, a SIR model with time-varying parameters was fitted to the COVID-19 data. Taking advantage of the proposed algorithm, more than 50 parameters were adequately estimated for each country.","Yang, Hyunjoo; Lee, Jaeyong",,331,1

It would be beneficial to identify clinical signs that predict adverse outcomes to anticipate clinical deterioration and optimize management. COVID-19 has presented with a variety of patterns on computed tomography (CT) and these findings may assist in disease stratification. This study aims to identify potential CT characteristics that may portend adverse outcomes. Methods: This is a retrospective review of 559 symptomatic patients infected with COVID-19 admitted from March 2020 to May 2020 at Temple University Hospital (Philadelphia, PA) who received thorax CT scans on admission. These scans were independently reviewed by a chest radiologist and evaluated for the presence of ground glass opacities, consolidations, interlobular septal thickening, enlarged pulmonary artery (PA) diameter, centrilobular nodules, and crazy paving pattern. Common CT findings were then associated with a combined adverse inpatient outcome (requiring high-flow oxygen, mechanical ventilation, and/or death) through univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results: Of the 559 patients, 182 (32.6%) required high-flow oxygen, mechanical ventilation, and/or died. The cohort with adverse outcomes were older (mean age 65.0 years vs 56.7 years, p&lt;0.0001), but had statistically similar gender, BMI and duration of symptoms compared to the cohort without adverse outcomes. The adverse outcome cohort had more COPD (18.7% vs 8.2%) but had statistically similar proportions of hypertension, diabetes, asthma, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure. On multivariate logistic regression, a PA diameter greater than 30mm (OR 1.056 [95% CI 1.015-1.097], p=0.0064), segmental consolidations (OR 2.359 [95% CI 1.446-3.848], p=0.0009), and non-segmental consolidations (OR 2.441, [95% CI 1.440-4.140], p=0.0009) were found to be significant predictors of adverse inpatient outcomes of either requiring high-flow nasal cannula, mechanical ventilation, or death. Conclusion: In symptomatic COVID-19 patients, enlarged PA diameter and consolidations on chest CT were associated with worse outcomes. These findings are likely representative of advanced pulmonary involvement and may be predictors of patients who require more aggressive upfront therapy. Multicenter analysis would be beneficial to confirm these findings.","Zheng, M.; Patel, R.; Leopold, I.; Thomas, A.; Standiford, T.; Townsend, R.; Zhao, H.; Gupta, R.; Rali, P.; Criner, G.

These policies explicitly encouraged homeworking, hence reducing the number of commuters with the implicit assumption that restricting peoples' movement reduces risk of infection for travellers and other people in their areas of residence and work. Yet, the spatial interrelation of different areas has been rarely addressed both in the public discourse and in early accounts of the various consequences of COVID-19. METHODS: Our study proposes a spatial analysis of the association between commuting flows and COVID-19 mortality in England between March and June 2020, using a range of publicly available area-level data. To account for spatial correlation, we used a structural mobility gravity model to analyse commuting flows between Local Authority Districts. By accounting for these spatial dependencies, we temper concerns of bias and inefficiency affecting simple linear estimates. Additionally, we disentangle the direct and indirect (from other areas) influence of commuting on COVID-19 mortality. RESULTS: The results of our spatial regression models suggest that higher commuting flows - in general and particularly by public transport - are associated with higher COVID-19 mortality. Our results are consistent with a reduction in COVID-related mortality after the introduction of a national lockdown in March. The spatial-lag term is statistically significant, highlighting the importance of accounting for spatial dependencies. CONCLUSION: We suggest that considering spatial interactions through commuting or travel motivations may offer interesting perspectives on the trade-off between health and economic activity during lockdowns.","Francetic, Igor; Munford, Luke",Eur. j. public health,331,32

Although the mechanisms underlying this link are not well established, a number of potential factors may be involved. Indeed, the obesity-related vulnerability to infectious diseases could be due to chronic low-grade inflammation, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperleptinemia, which lead to a weakening of both the innate and adaptive immune responses. In addition, obesity results in anatomical-functional changes by the mechanical obstacle of excessive adipose tissue that blunt the respiratory mechanisms and predisposing to respiratory infections. Subjects with obesity are also at risk of skin folds and sweat more profusely due to the thick layers of subcutaneous fat, favoring the proliferation of microorganisms and slowing the repair of wounds down. All these factors make subjects with obesity more prone to develop nosocomial infections, surgical site, skin and soft tissue infections, bacteremia, urinary tract infections, and mycosis. Furthermore, infections in subjects with obesity have a worse prognosis, frequently prolonging hospitalization time as demonstrated for several flu viruses and recently for COVID-19. Thus, the aim of this manuscript is to provide an overview of the current clinical evidence on the associations between obesity and infectious diseases highlighting physio pathological insights involved in this link.","Muscogiuri, Giovanna; Pugliese, Gabriella; Laudisio, Daniela; Castellucci, Bianca; Barrea, Luigi; Savastano, Silvia; Colao, Annamaria",Obes Rev,331,27

These same warnings are reverberating during the COVID-19 pandemic. Consideration of the impacts of EVD on maternal and child health services from facility data can be instructive during COVID-19. We surveyed all peripheral healthcare units (PHUs) in Sierra Leone in October 2014 and March 2015 to assess closures, staffing, amenities, medicines, supplies, and service utilization during May 2014-January 2015 and October 2013-January 2014. We report PHU characteristics and service utilization changes for equivalent 4-month periods during the epidemic and the prior year. We present utilization changes by district and service type, and model excess child mortality. PHU closures (-8%) and staff attrition (-3%) were limited, but many facilities lacked amenities, medicines, and supplies. Utilization of preventive and scheduled services fell more than individualized, clinical care interventions, aside from malaria treatment which declined significantly. Ebola virus disease intensity in districts was weakly associated with utilization, aside from two districts that were severely affected. Modeling suggests utilization declines resulted in 6,782 excess under-five deaths (an increase of 21%) between 2014 and 2015. Ebola virus disease negatively affected service provision, but utilization declined relatively more, particularly for preventive and scheduled interventions. Although these findings are specific to Sierra Leone's EVD epidemic, they illustrate the magnitude of possible effects in other settings due to COVID-19-induced service disruptions, where collateral impacts on child mortality from other preventable causes may far outweigh COVID-19 mortality.","Ngo, Thi Minh; Rogers, Braeden; Patnaik, Rajesh; Jambai, Amara; Sharkey, Alyssa B",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,331,6

Specifically, we integrate the prevention-based public health model with the Total Worker Health (TWH) and OHP-based approaches to propose a comprehensive set of primary, secondary, and tertiary interventions that target different groups of employees with varied exposure risks to the new coronavirus. We believe these proposed interventions can contribute positively to the development of healthy and safe work. Implications of these proposed interventions for workers, organizations, and policy makers are also discussed.","Chang, Chu-Hsiang; Shao, Ruodan; Wang, Mo; Baker, Nathan M",Occup Health Sci,331,17

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult patients with groups 1 and 4 PPH were invited to participate in the study. Age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were also recruited as controls. At baseline, patients underwent clinical examination, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide measurement and CMR with feature tracking post-processing (CMR-FT). Healthy controls underwent only CMR-FT. The study's primary endpoint was clinical failure, defined as death, hospitalization or demonstrable clinical deterioration during follow-up. Patients who were unable to perform 6-minute walking test due to musculoskeletal disorders were excluded from the study. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients (8 men, 28 women; mean age, 50.6±13.8 [SD] years [range: 18.6-78.5years]) and 12 healthy control subjects (5 mean, 7 women; mean age, 40.6±13.5 [SD] years [range: 23.1-64.4years]) were recruited. Right ventricular global longitudinal strain (GLS) was significantly impaired in PPH patients (-20.2±5.3 [SD] % [range: -28.8 to -9.1%] vs. -28.4±3.1% [-33.7 to -22.7%] respectively, P<0.001). The right atrial GLS was significantly impaired in PPH compared to healthy controls (-19.9±4.5% [range: -28.6 to -3.6%] vs. -26.5±4.2% [range: -32.8 to -15.8%] respectively) (P<0.001). Clinical failure occurred in 19 (19/36, 53%) of patients. Right ventricular GLS predicted clinical failure most reliably among CMR parameters (-22.6±3.8 [SD] % [range: -27.6 to -12.7%] for patients without clinical failure vs. -18±5.6 [SD] % [range: -28.8 to -9.1%] for patients with clinical failure; hazard ratio [HR]=1.85; P=0.007; area under the AUC curve=0.75). Lower absolute right atrial GLS was significantly associated with clinical failure (-22.7±3.0 [SD] % [range: -28.6 to -17.7%] for patients without clinical failure vs. -16.9±5.8 [SD] % [range: -24.2 to -3.6%] for patients with clinical failure) (HR=1.53; P=0.035). CONCLUSION: CMR feature tracking-derived myocardial strain parameters of both the right atrium and ventricle can assist clinicians in the prognosis of PPH.","Kallifatidis, A; Mouratoglou, S-A; Giannakoulas, G; Finitsis, S; Karvounis, H; Sianos, G",Diagnostic and interventional imaging,331,12

Although the majority of infections in children are mild, there are many important, as yet, unanswered questions (specifically, the attack rate in children and the role of children as vectors of infection), that will have a major impact on disease in adults. There are no distinctive clinical characteristics that will allow the infectious disease consultant to make the diagnosis without laboratory testing. SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less common with lower morbidity and mortality than RSV or influenza and causes less severe disease in children with cancer than these more common viruses. The range of severity of infection during pregnancy is comparable to infection in non-pregnant cohorts. Intrauterine infection has been documented but is uncommon.

To understand the reasons for the wide-spectrum complications and severe outcomes of COVID-19, we aimed to identify cellular targets of SARS-CoV-2 tropism and replication in various tissues. METHODS: We evaluated RNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded autopsy tissues from 64 case-patients (age range: 1 month to 84 years; COVID-19 confirmed n=21, suspected n=43) by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. For cellular localization of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and viral characterization, we performed in-situ hybridization (ISH), subgenomic RNA RT-PCR, and whole genome sequencing. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was identified by RT-PCR in 32 case-patients (confirmed n=21 and suspected n=11). ISH was positive in 20 and subgenomic RNA RT-PCR was positive in 17 of 32 RT-PCR-positive case-patients. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was localized by ISH in hyaline membranes, pneumocytes and macrophages of lungs, epithelial cells of airways, and in endothelial cells and vessels wall of brain stem, leptomeninges, lung, heart, liver, kidney, and pancreas. D614G variant was detected in 9 RT-PCR-positive case-patients.

Renal bladder ultrasound (RBUS) is a good tool for establishing the diagnosis, however, additional imaging with a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) and dimercaptosuccinic acid scan (DMSA) might be required. We assessed the need for postnatal evaluation and the long-term consequences in patients with this diagnosis. METHODS: A retrospective review of the records of all patients diagnosed with CFRE between 2004 and 2014 was done. We included all patients who underwent postnatal evaluation with RBUS, DMSA and VCUG. Long-term radiological and functional outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 29 patients with CFRE were identified. Majority of cases were detected antenatally (79%) and left to right crossed ectopia constituted the majority of cases (65%). RBUS revealed associated hydronephrosis (HN) in 11 patients (38%). DMSA scans confirmed the diagnosis in all patients and showed impaired renal function in 10 ectopic kidneys (34%). Vesicoureteral reflux was detected in 12 patients (41%); one third of them needed surgical intervention. Extra-urinary anomalies were present in 14 patients (48%) mainly of cardiac origin. After a mean follow-up of 4.5â¯years, 4 patients (14%) with extra-urinary anomalies developed chronic kidney disease and two of them died. CONCLUSIONS: Crossed fused renal ectopia is commonly associated with both urinary and extraurinary malformations. Postnatal RBUS is usually sufficient for diagnosis, however, additional imaging may aid for confirming the diagnosis and detection of associated urinary anomalies. Presence of extra-urinary malformations with crossed fused ectopia carries a higher risk of morbidity. TYPE OF THE STUDY: Retrospective study [diagnostic/prognostic study].

METHODS: Asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by SARS-COV-2 nucleic acid testing in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were retrospectively enrolled. The characteristics of CT imaging and clinical feature were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: 58 asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to our hospital between Jan 1, 2020 and Feb 23, 2020 were enrolled. All patients had history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. On admission, patients had no symptoms and laboratory findings were normal. The predominant feature of CT findings in this cohort was ground glass opacity (GGO) (55, 94.8%) with peripheral (44, 75.9%) distribution, unilateral location (34, 58.6%) and mostly involving one or two lobes (38, 65.5%), often accompanied by characteristic signs. After short-term follow-up, 16 patients (27.6%) presented symptoms with lower lymphocyte count and higher CRP, mainly including fever, cough and fatigue. The evolution of lesions on CT imaging were observed in 10 patients (17.2%). The average days of hospitalization was19.80±10.82 days, and was significantly longer in progression patients (28.60±7.55 day). CONCLUSION: CT imaging of asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 pneumonia has definite characteristics. Since asymptomatic infections as ""covert transmitter"", and some patients can progress rapidly in the short term. It is essential to pay attention to the surveillance of asymptomatic patients with COVID-19. CT scan has great value in screening and detecting patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially in the highly suspicious, asymptomatic cases with negative nucleic acid testing.","Meng, Heng; Xiong, Rui; He, Ruyuan; Lin, Weichen; Hao, Bo; Zhang, Lin; Lu, Zilong; Shen, Xiaokang; Fan, Tao; Jiang, Wenyang; Yang, Wenbin; Li, Tao; Chen, Jun; Geng, Qing",J Infect,331,30

The aim of our study was to assess the effect of stay-at-home orders on glycemic control in children. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 238 children with type 1 and type 2 diabetes who were seen in the Pediatric Endocrinology Clinic at the University of South Alabama. Average Hemoglobin A1c (A1c) levels in the year prior to stay-at home orders (May 2019-April 2020) were compared with A1c values during the quarantine period (May 2020-July 2020) using a paired t-test. We also analyzed the change of A1c level with respect to sex, race, type of diabetes, type of insurance, and mode of insulin administration, using a 2-sample t-test. RESULTS: The average A1c significantly increased from 9.2% during the previous year to 9.5% during the quarantine period (p = 0.0097). The increase of A1c was significantly higher in public insurance patients (0.49% increase) compared to private insurance patients (0.03% increase), (p = 0.0137). We also observed a significant association between the direction of change and type of insurance. Forty-eight percent of public insurance patients had an A1c increase of > 0.5% while 54% of private insurance patients had no change or decrease in A1c (p = 0.0079). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in worsening glycemic control in children with type 1 diabetes, with those on public insurance affected in greater proportion than those with private insurance.","Gayoso, Miriannette; Lim, Whei Ying; Mulekar, Madhuri S; Kaulfers, Anne-Marie D",Clin Diabetes Endocrinol,331,16
458453,458453,458453,Inaugural President's Address,18.067656,7.455598,2020,"BACKGROUND: Stark gaps exist between projected health needs in a pandemic situation and the current capacity of health care and medical countermeasure systems. Existing pandemic ethics discussions have advocated to engage the public in scarcity dilemmas and attend the local contexts and cultural perspectives that shape responses to a global health threat. This public engagement study thus considers the role of community and culture in the ethical apportionment of scarce health resources, specifically ventilators, during an influenza pandemic. It builds upon a previous exploration of the values and preferences of Maryland residents regarding how a finite supply of mechanical ventilators ought to be allocated during a severe global outbreak of influenza. An important finding of this earlier research was that local history and place within the state engendered different ways of thinking about scarcity. OBJECTIVE: Given the intrastate variation in the themes expressed by Maryland participants, the project team sought to examine interstate differences by implementing the same protocol elsewhere to answer the following questions. Does variation in ethical frames of reference exist within different regions of the United States? What practical implications does evidence of sameness and difference possess for pandemic planners and policymakers at local and national levels? METHODS: Research using the same deliberative democracy process from the Maryland study was conducted in Central Texas in March 2018 among 30 diverse participants, half of whom identified as Hispanic or Latino. Deliberative democracy provides a moderated process through which community members can learn facts about a public policy matter from experts and explore their own and others' views. RESULTS: Participants proposed that by evenly distributing supplies of ventilators and applying clear eligibility criteria consistently, health authorities could enable fair allocation of scarce lifesaving equipment. The strong identification, attachment, and obligation of persons toward their nuclear and extended families emerged as a distinctive regional and ethnic core value that has practical implications for the substance, administration, and communication of allocation frameworks. CONCLUSIONS: Maryland and Central Texas residents expressed a common, overriding concern about the fairness of allocation decisions. Central Texas deliberants, however, more readily expounded upon family as a central consideration. In Central Texas, family is a principal, culturally inflected lens through which life and death matters are often viewed. Conveners of other pandemic-related public engagement exercises in the United States have advocated the benefits of transparency and inclusivity in developing an ethical allocation framework; this study demonstrates cultural competence as a further advantage.","Schoch-Spana, Monica; Brunson, Emily K; Gwon, Howard; Regenberg, Alan; Toner, Eric S; Daugherty-Biddison, Elizabeth L",J Particip Med,331,13

However, elevated levels of BCAAs and their metabolites are linked to insulin resistance. We previously demonstrated that the leucine metabolite, &#945;-ketoisocaproate (KIC), inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose transport in myotubes. Like KIC, inflammatory factors are implicated in the development of insulin resistance. Here, we analyzed the effect of KIC and inflammatory factors (homocysteine [50 µM], TNF-&#945; [10 ng/ml], and interleukin 6 (IL-6) [10 ng/ml]) on myotubes. Although KIC suppressed insulin-stimulated glucose transport, addition of the inflammatory factors did not worsen this effect. Depletion of branched-chain aminotransferase 2, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of leucine into KIC, abrogated the effect of KIC and the inflammatory factors. The effect of insulin on AKTS473 and S6K1T389 phosphorylation was not modified by treatments. There were no treatment effects on glycogen synthase phosphorylation. Depletion of E1&#945; subunit of branched-chain &#945;-keto acid dehydrogenase, the enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of KIC, suppressed insulin-stimulated glucose transport, especially in cells incubated in KIC. Thus, defects in BCAA catabolism are contributory to insulin resistance of glucose transport in myotubes, especially in the presence of KIC. Interventions that increase BCAA catabolism may promote muscle glucose utilization and improve insulin resistance and its sequelae.","Mann, Gagandeep; Adegoke, Olasunkanmi A J",Physiol Rep,331,1

To achieve herd immunity, widespread administration is required which necessitates significant cooperation from the general public. As such, it is crucial that governments and public health agencies understand public sentiment towards vaccines, which can help guide educational campaigns and other targeted policy interventions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and apply an artificial-intelligence (AI)-based approach to analyse social-media public sentiment in the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US) towards COVID-19 vaccinations, to better understand public attitude and identify topics of concern. METHODS: Over 300,000 social-media posts related to COVID-19 vaccinations were extracted, including 23,571 Facebook-posts from the UK and 144,864 from the US, along with 40,268 tweets from the UK and 98,385 from the US respectively, from 1st March - 22nd November 2020. We used natural-language processing and deep learning-based techniques to predict average sentiments, sentiment trends and topics of discussion. These were analysed longitudinally and geo-spatially, and a manual-reading of randomly selected posts around points of interest helped identify underlying themes and validated insights from the analysis. RESULTS: We found overall averaged positive, negative and neutral sentiment in the UK to be 58%, 22% and 17%, compared to 56%, 24% and 18% in the US, respectively. Public optimism over vaccine development, effectiveness and trials as well as concerns over safety, economic viability and corporation control were identified. We compared our findings to national surveys in both countries and found them to correlate broadly. CONCLUSIONS: AI-enabled social-media analysis should be considered for adoption by institutions and governments, alongside surveys and other conventional methods of assessing public attitude. This could enable real-time assessment, at scale, of public confidence and trust in COVID-19 vaccinations, help address concerns of vaccine-sceptics and develop more effective policies and communication strategies to maximise uptake.","Hussain, Amir; Tahir, Ahsen; Hussain, Zain; Sheikh, Zakariya; Gogate, Mandar; Dashtipour, Kia; Ali, Azhar; Sheikh, Aziz",J. med. internet res,331,24

Here, we evaluated the effectiveness of pulse-steroid in case of unresponsiveness to treatment with high dose steroid. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study is a retrospective controlled trial. We divided the patients in three groups: Standard-care therapy alone, high-dose steroid treatment and pulse-steroid treatment (250 mg/day methy-prednisolone). One hundred fifty patients were enrolled in each group. All patients were hospitalized and needed oxygen support. We matched the patients according to disease severity at the onset of hypoxia, weight of co-morbidities, age and gender. We then compared three groups in terms of mortality, length of hospitalization, need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mechanical ventilation (MV), length of stay in ICU and duration of MV. RESULTS: The pulse-steroid group had shorter ICU stay. The median ICU stay was 9.0(CI 95% 6.0-12.0) days in standard ?care group, 8.0(CI 95% 5.0-13.0) days in high-dose steroid group and 4.5(CI %95 3.0-8.0) days in pulse-steroid group. Moreover, although they were initially unresponsive to steroid therapy, they achieved similar results compared to the high-dose steroid group in other outcomes except for length of hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: Pulse-steroid treatment would be an option for COVID-19 patients who do not respond to the initial high-dose steroid treatment.","Batirel, Ayse; Demirhan, Recep; Eser, Nurullah; Körlü, Ezgi; Tezcan, Mehmet Engin",Turkish journal of medical sciences,331,1

This need is more urgent in resource-constrained settings. The present study aimed to identify the predictors of ICU admission among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. STUDY DESIGN: The current study was conducted based on a retrospective cohort design. . METHODS: The participants included 665 definite cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) hospitalized in Imam Hossein Hospital from February 20 to May 14, 2020. The baseline characteristics of patients were assessed, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was utilized to determine the significant odds ratio (OR) for ICU admission. RESULTS: Participants were aged 59.52±16.72 years, and the majority (55.6%) of them were male. Compared to non-ICU patients (n=547), the ICU patients (n=118) were older, had more baseline comorbidities, and presented more often with dyspnea, convulsion, loss of consciousness, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia, and less often with myalgia. Significant OR (95% CI) of ICU admission was observed for the 60-80 age group (2.42, 95%CI: 1.01; 5.79), &#8805;80 age group (3.73, 95%CI: 1.44; 9.42), &#8805;3 comorbidities (2.07, 95%CI: 1.31; 3.80), loss of consciousness (6.70, 95%CI: 2.94, 15.24), tachypnea (1.79, 95%CI: 1.03, 3.11), and SpO2<90 (5.83, 95%CI: 2.74; 12.4). Abnormal laboratory results were more common among ICU-admitted patients; in this regard, leukocytosis (4.45, 95%CI: 1.49, 13.31), lymphopenia (2.39, 95%CI: 1.30; 4.39), elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) (1.99, 95%CI: 1.04; 3.83), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (2.25, 95%CI: 1.18-4.30) had a significant OR of ICU admission. Chest computer tomography (CT) revealed that consolidation (1.82, 95%CI: 1.02, 3.24), pleural effusion (3.19, 95%CI: 1.71, 5.95), and crazy paving pattern (8.36, 95%CI: 1.92, 36.48) had a significant OR of ICU admission. CONCLUSION: As evidenced by the obtained results, the predictors of ICU admission were identified among epidemiological characteristics, presenting symptoms and signs, laboratory tests, and chest CT findings.","Hatami, Hossein; Soleimantabar, Hussein; Ghasemian, Mehrdad; Delbari, Negar; Aryannezhad, Shayan",J Res Health Sci,331,1

Many patients suffer from systemic life-threatening problems and need to be carefully monitored in ICUs. Thus the intelligent prognosis is in an urgent need to assist physicians to take an early intervention, prevent the adverse outcome, and optimize the medical resource allocation. However, in the early stage of the epidemic outbreak, the data available for analysis is limited due to the lack of effective diagnostic mechanisms, rarity of the cases, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning-based approach, CovidCare, which leverages the existing electronic medical records to enhance the prognosis for inpatients with emerging infectious diseases. It learns to embed the COVID-19-related medical features based on massive existing EMR data via transfer learning. The transferred parameters are further trained to imitate the teacher model's representation behavior based on knowledge distillation, which embeds the health status more comprehensively in the source dataset. We conduct the length of stay prediction experiments for patients on a real-world COVID-19 dataset. The experiment results indicate that our proposed model consistently outperforms the comparative baseline methods. CovidCare also reveals that, 1) hs-cTnI, hs-CRP and Platelet Counts are the most fatal biomarkers, whose abnormal values usually indicate emergency adverse outcome. 2) Normal values of gamma-GT, AP and eGFR indicate the overall improvement of health. The medical findings extracted by CovidCare are empirically confirmed by human experts and medical literatures.","Ma, Liantao; Ma, Xinyu; Gao, Junyi; Zhang, Chaohe; Yu, Zhihao; Jiao, Xianfeng; Ruan, Wenjie; Wang, Yasha; Tang, Wen; Wang, Jiangtao",,331,33

The Affordable Care Act in its attempt to create expanded health access has met with significant challenges. The conservative Supreme Court decreases the likelihood of a federal mandated single payer model. As uncertainty of the structure of the healthcare system increases, this paper supports its transformation to a single payer model. Healthcare should be considered a duty within the framework of a Kantian approach to ethics and a social good. Evidently ignoring this duty, the American health system perpetuates a healthcare underclass, with underserved portions of the population, with unequal access to quality care and persistent health status and outcome disparities. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the effect of social determinants on optimal health outcome. A health insurance system based on the nation's commonly held values has the potential to eliminate these disparities.","Markowitz, W.; McLeod-Sordjan, R.",Frontiers in Sociology,331,16

Given the link between lung disease and aging, we need to understand how molecular indicators of aging relate to lung function and disease. Using data from the population-based KORA (Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg) surveys, we associated baseline epigenetic (DNA methylation) age acceleration with incident COPD and lung function. Models were adjusted for age, sex, smoking, height, weight, and baseline lung disease as appropriate. Associations were replicated in the Normative Aging Study. Of 770 KORA participants, 131 developed incident COPD over 7 years. Baseline accelerated epigenetic aging was significantly associated with incident COPD. The change in age acceleration (follow-up - baseline) was more strongly associated with COPD than baseline aging alone. The association between the change in age acceleration between baseline and follow-up and incident COPD replicated in the Normative Aging Study. Associations with spirometric lung function parameters were weaker than those with COPD, but a meta-analysis of both cohorts provide suggestive evidence of associations. Accelerated epigenetic aging, both baseline measures and changes over time, may be a risk factor for COPD and reduced lung function.","Breen, Miyuki; Nwanaji-Enwerem, Jamaji C; Karrasch, Stefan; Flexeder, Claudia; Schulz, Holger; Waldenberger, Melanie; Kunze, Sonja; Ollert, Markus; Weidinger, Stefan; Colicino, Elena; Gao, Xu; Wang, Cuicui; Shen, Jincheng; Just, Allan C; Vokonas, Pantel; Sparrow, David; Hou, Lifang; Schwartz, Joel D; Baccarelli, Andrea A; Peters, Annette; Ward-Caviness, Cavin K","Aging (Albany, N.Y.

Simple mathematical modelling is used in the context of a single, relatively closed workplace such as a factory or back-office where, in normal operation, each worker has lengthy interactions with a fixed set of colleagues. A discrete-time SEIR model on a fixed interaction graph is simulated with parameters that are motivated by the recent COVID-19 pandemic in the UK during a post-peak phase, including a small risk of viral infection from outside the working environment. Two kinds of worker are assumed, transparents who regularly test, share their results with colleagues and isolate as soon as a contact tests positive for the disease, and opaques who do none of these. Moreover, the simulations are constructed as a ``playable model""in which the transparency level, disease parameters and mean interaction degree can be varied by the user. The model is analysed in the continuum limit. All simulations point to the double benefit of transparency in maximising productivity and minimising overall infection rates. Based on these findings, public policy implications are discussed on how to incentivise this mutually beneficial behaviour in different kinds of workplace, and simple recommendations are made.","Way, Arkady; Champneys, Alan; Dyson, Rosemary J; Alwan, Nisreen A; Barker, Mary",,331,23

However, COVID-19 morbidity among residents of senior independent and assisted living communities, in which residents do not live as closely together as do residents in SNFs and do not require skilled nursing services, has not been described. During March 5-9, 2020, two residents of a senior independent and assisted living community in Seattle (facility 1) were hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection; on March 6, social distancing and other preventive measures were implemented in the community. UW Medicine (the health system linked to the University of Washington), Public Health - Seattle & King County, and CDC conducted an investigation at the facility. On March 10, all residents and staff members at facility 1 were tested for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and asked to complete a questionnaire about their symptoms; all residents were tested again 7 days later. Among 142 residents and staff members tested during the initial phase, three of 80 residents (3.8%) and two of 62 staff members (3.2%) had positive test results. The three residents had no symptoms at the time of testing, although one reported an earlier cough that had resolved. A fourth resident, who had negative test results in the initial phase, had positive test results 7 days later. This resident was asymptomatic on both days. Possible explanations for so few cases of COVID-19 in this residential community compared with those in several Seattle SNFs with high morbidity and mortality include more social distancing among residents and less contact with health care providers. In addition, early implementation of stringent isolation and protective measures after identification of two COVID-19 cases might have been effective in minimizing spread of the virus in this type of setting. When investigating a potential outbreak of COVID-19 in senior independent and assisted living communities, symptom screening is unlikely to be sufficient to identify all persons infected with SARS-CoV-2. Adherence to CDC guidance to prevent COVID-19 transmission in senior independent and assisted living communities (4) could be instrumental in preventing a facility outbreak.","Roxby, Alison C; Greninger, Alexander L; Hatfield, Kelly M; Lynch, John B; Dellit, Timothy H; James, Allison; Taylor, Joanne; Page, Libby C; Kimball, Anne; Arons, Melissa; Schieve, Laura A; Munanga, Albert; Stone, Nimalie; Jernigan, John A; Reddy, Sujan C; Lewis, James; Cohen, Seth A; Jerome, Keith R; Duchin, Jeffrey S; Neme, Santiago",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,331,20

MethodsIn this scoping review, articles published between December 2019 and 11 November 2020 were selected if they included an empirical component (explicit scientific methods to collect and analyse primary data), LAC population was researched, and the research was about the COVID-19 pandemic, regardless of publication status or language. MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Scielo, CENTRAL and Epistemonikos were searched. All titles and abstracts, and full texts were screened by two independent reviewers. Data from included studies was extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second independent reviewer. Results14,406 records were found. After removing duplicates, 5,458 titles and abstracts were screened, of which 2,323 full texts were revised to finally include 1,626 empirical studies. The largest portion of research came from people/population of Brazil (54.6%), Mexico (19.1%), Colombia (11.2%), Argentina (10.4%), Peru (10.3%) and Chile (10%), while Caribbean countries concentrated 15.3%. The methodologies most used were cross-sectional studies (34.7%), simulation models (17.5%) and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (13.6%). Using a modified version of WHOs COVID-19 Coordinated Global Research Roadmap classification, 54.2% were epidemiological studies, followed by clinical management (22.3%) and candidate therapeutics (12.2%). Government and public funds support were reported in 19.2% of studies, followed by universities or research centres (9%), but 47.5% did not include any funding statement. ConclusionDuring the first part of the COVID-19 pandemic, LAC countries have contributed to the global research effort primarily with epidemiological studies, with little participation on vaccines research, meaning that this type of knowledge would be imported from elsewhere. Research agendas could be further coordinated aiming to enhance shared self-sufficiency regarding knowledge needs in the region.","Mansilla, Cristian; Herrera, Cristian A; Boeira, Laura; Yearwood, Andrea; Lopez, Analia S; Colunga-Lozano, Luis E; Brocard, Eva; Villacres, Tatiana; Velez, Marcela; Paolantonio, Gabriel Di; Reveiz, Ludovic",,331,1

In Euope and North America, however, their use has been stigmatised for a long time, although this view has radically changed during the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Notwithstanding this, it is still unclear whether face masks worn by COVID-19 carriers may indeed prevent viral transmission and environmental contamination. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of surgical face masks in filtering SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Four male patients with COVID-19 were recruited for the study. Two patients wore a surgical mask for 5 h, while two others did not. The spread of the virus in the environment was evaluated through the approved Allplex 2019-nCoV assay. RESULTS: In the room with the two patients without surgical masks, the swab performed on the headboard and sides of the beds was positive for SARS-CoV-2 contamination. In the other room, where two patients were wearing surgical masks, all of the swabs obtained after 5 h tested negative. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study add to the growing body of literature supporting the use of face masks as a measure to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by retaining potentially contagious droplets that can infect other people and/or contaminate surfaces. Based on the current evidence, face masks should therefore be considered a useful and low-cost device in addition to social distancing and hand hygiene during the postlockdown phase.","Landi, Francesco; Marzetti, Emanuele; Sanguinetti, Maurizio; Ciciarello, Francesca; Tritto, Marcello; Benvenuto, Francesca; Bramato, Giulia; Brandi, Vincenzo; Carfì, Angelo; D039,; Angelo, Emanuela; Fusco, Domenico; Lo Monaco, Maria Rita; Martone, Anna Maria; Pagano, Francesco; Rocchi, Sara; Rota, Elisabetta; Russo, Andrea; Salerno, Andrea; Cattani, Paola; Marchetti, Simona; Bernabei On Behalf Of The Gemelli Against Covid-Geriatric Team, Roberto",Trans.

Moderate-to-severe QTc prolongation during therapy was defined as a QTc interval >470 ms in men or >480 ms in women. Patients were treated under strict cardiac supervision. A total of 105 adults were included [56% male; median (IQR) age 69 (57-79) years]. All patients received therapy with HCQ in combination with azithromycin (AZM), and 95 (90%) also with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r). Concomitant medications classified as having risk of developing torsades de pointes (TdP) were simultaneously used in 81 patients (77%). Moderate-to-severe QTc prolongation was observed in 14 patients (13%), mostly at Days 3-5 from baseline, with 6 (6%) developing severe prolongation (>500 ms). There was no evidence of TdP arrhythmia or TdP-associated death. Adding LPV/r to HCQ+AZM did not significantly prolong the QTc interval. Multivariable Cox regression revealed that comedications with known risk of TdP (HR = 11.28, 95% CI 1.08-117.41), higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte (NLR) ratio (HR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.03-1.18 per unit increase) and higher serum hs-cardiac troponin I (HR = 4.09, 95% CI 1.36-12.2 per unit increase) were major contributors to moderate-to-severe QTc prolongation. In this closely screened and monitored cohort, no complications derived from QTc prolongation were observed during pharmacological therapy containing HCQ for COVID-19. Evidence of myocardial injury with elevated troponin and strong inflammatory response, specifically higher NLR, are conditions requiring careful QTc interval monitoring.","Padilla, Sergio; Telenti, Guillermo; Guillén, Lucía; García, José A; García-Abellán, Javier; Ding, Carolina; Mora, Antonia; García-Pachón, Eduardo; Gutiérrez, Félix; Masiá, Mar",Int J Antimicrob Agents,331,16

Several reports have described the gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations in the infected patients. The systematic review was designed to highlight the gaps in our knowledge about the prevalence and clinical significance of GI symptoms in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We searched PubMed database and Google articles published in both English and Chinese up to June 3, 2020, using search terms ""Clinical features"", ""2019 novel coronavirus"", ""2019-nCoV"", ""COVID-19"", or ""SARS-Cov-2"". Observational studies, case reports or letters describing the clinical features or observational studies regarding the detection and/or isolation of SARS-Cov-2 viruses in stools were included. RESULTS: A total of 22 publications were finally selected. It was reported that GI symptoms occurred in about 3%-40.7% of patients. GI manifestations included nausea, diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, abdominal pain, belching, abdominal distension and GI haemorrhage. Diarrhea was the most common GI symptom. Infected patients had various degrees of liver dysfunction, and the severity of liver dysfunction was significantly associated with the severity of the disease. Therapy focusing on digestive system like liver supportive therapy or nutrition support or probiotics have been demonstrated to be effective interventions, which greatly improve prognosis. Fecal-oral transmission route is a potential risk for transmission. CONCLUSIONS: GI symptoms are common in COVID-19. Strengthening the recognition on abnormalities in digestive system of patients with COVID-19 is crucial for early identification and timely treatment, especially for those atypical patients. Hygiene protection and keep drainpipe free-flowing are necessary for everyone.","Ye, Lei; Yang, Zhao; Liu, Jiong; Liao, Lianming; Wang, Fangyu",J. gastroenterol. hepatol,331,16

MATERIAL AND METHODS The medical records of 159 children who were admitted to our hospital from January 23 to March 20, 2020, were retrospectively analyzed. Samples from pharyngeal or/and anal swabs were subjected to reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 within 12 h of patient admission; a second RT-PCR test was done 24 h after the first test. RESULTS Of the 159 patients, 151 patients had epidemiological histories, 14 patients had cluster onset, and 8 patients had no epidemiological history but had symptoms similar to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The most common symptom was fever (n=125), followed by respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. A 7-year-old boy in a cluster family from Wuhan was confirmed with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection with ground-glass opacity shadows on his lung computed tomography scan, and his swab RT-PCR test had not turned negative until day 19 of his hospitalization. In patients who did not test positive for SARS-CoV-2, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus were observed.

On the basis of theories from occupational health, we propose that the duration of the pandemic, its demands (e.g., having to work from home, closing of childcare facilities, job insecurity, work-privacy conflicts, privacy-work conflicts) and personal- and job-related resources (co-worker social support, job autonomy, partner support and corona self-efficacy) interact in their effect on employee exhaustion. We test the hypotheses with a three-wave sample of German employees during the pandemic from April to June 2020 (Nw1 = 2900, Nw12 = 1237, Nw123 = 789). Our findings show a curvilinear effect of pandemic duration on working women's exhaustion. The data also show that the introduction and the easing of lockdown measures affect exhaustion, and that women with children who work from home while childcare is unavailable are especially exhausted. Job autonomy and partner support mitigated some of these effects. In sum, women's psychological health was more strongly affected by the pandemic than men's. We discuss implications for occupational health theories and that interventions targeted at mitigating the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic should target women specifically.","Meyer, Bertolt; Zill, Alexander; Dilba, Dominik; Gerlach, Rebecca; Schumann, Susen",,331,1

We have also discussed the impact of social media on aesthetic surgeons' practice, lifestyle and its role as an emerging new method of medical education. Methods: A questionnaire consisting of 62 questions divided in 3 sections was rolled out to 150 Indian aesthetic surgeons who have been practising either independently in their clinics or are associated with hospitals. A: Pre-COVID practice management and lifestyle; B: life during the lockdown; C: anticipated changes in post-COVID era. Results: In the pre-COVID era, an average aesthetic surgeon was finely balancing his profession, personal lifestyle, learning, and recreation. The lockdown clamped their practices which lead into a financial drought; despite which, they were able to maintain their productivity by engaging in webinars, reading, and research. The post-COVID times demand an implementation of safety protocols along with changes in set-up, regulating patient traffic, engaging in distant learning through virtual conferences, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle acquired during the lockdown. Conclusions: India was rightly witnessing a surge in popularity of aesthetic surgery and medical tourism over the last decade. The corona pandemic has definitely hit this escalating growth curve hard, and it will take some time for the demand to recover. Our study revealed the following conclusions: The effect of COVID 19 demands a major change in aesthetic surgeons' professional practice like limiting consultations, changing hospital floor plan, following COVID testing, and having new safety protocols. Social media is rightly poised to be a major tool for education and marketing as also for recreation and leisure. The role of teleconsultation needs to be reprised and legalised. Webinars and virtual conferences will find more takers in future.Level of evidence: not ratable.","Thakurani, Sangeeta; Gupta, Samarth",Eur J Plast Surg,331,26

Calls were categorized as related to ""Schools"", ""Access"", ""Food"", ""Hospitals"", ""Transportation"", and ""Unemployment"". Overall call types, and among school-related calls, detailed call types, were compared over the years, using chi-squared tests. School-related inquiries increased by 71% from 2018 to 2020. During 2020, the most common (49%, n = 22,471) call description was ""Coronavirus and Schools"", encompassing calls about learning options, safety, and resources. Spikes in these calls corresponded to official announcements, including those about Fall reopening plans (August 31: n = 678; September 1: n = 624) and schedules and staffing (September 16th: n = 1043; September 17th: n = 713), and after the start of in-person learning (September 21: n = 680). This study demonstrates that as government officials updated NYC schooling plans for Fall 2020, there were increased concerns among NYC residents. Future COVID-19 schooling changes need to be conveyed clearly and disseminated effectively in order to avoid confusion about NYC's pandemic learning strategy and to address health and safety concerns.","Eugene, Adriana; Alpert, Naomi; Lieberman-Cribbin, Wil; Taioli, Emanuela",J. community health,331,16

How occupational therapy practice educators experienced fieldwork supervision during this rapid redesign of service delivery is not widely understood. This study aimed to explore the experiences of practice educators who supervised occupational therapy students during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. Methods Fifteen occupational therapy practice educators participated in focus groups and individual semi-structured interviews. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to understand the experiences of the participants and explore the barriers and facilitators to providing practice education in this context. Findings The experiences of the occupational therapy practice educators were interpreted into three themes: (1) Opportunities lost and then created (as two subthemes);(2) The relationship between the student and practice educator (comprising subthemes of practicing self-care and connection and support);and (3) Signing-off of students' competencies. While digital platforms were initially viewed as limiting, they also were used to create new opportunities for student learning. Participants spoke of being mindful of their and students' wellbeing and finding ways to provide connection and support. Participants were challenged by the need to adapt how they evaluated students in the context of a pandemic. Conclusion The findings of this study highlight the complexities of occupational therapy practice education in the rapidly shifting context of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. The outcomes highlight the importance of creating new ways of using digital platforms during practice education while focussing on the relationships with students.","Peart, Annette Wells Nathanael Yu Mong-Lin Brown Ted",Australian Occupational Therapy Journal,331,16

To better understand host immune determinants of congenital infection at the maternal-fetal tissue interface, we performed a comparative analysis of innate and adaptive immune cell subsets in the peripheral blood and decidua of healthy rhesus macaque pregnancies across all trimesters of gestation and determined changes after Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. Using one 28-color and one 18-color polychromatic flow cytometry panel we simultaneously analyzed the frequency, phenotype, activation status and trafficking properties of &#945;ß T, Î³Î´ T, iNKT, regulatory T (Treg), NK cells, B lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DC). Decidual leukocytes showed a striking enrichment of activated effector memory and tissue-resident memory CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, CD4+ Tregs, CD56+ NK cells, CD14+CD16+ monocytes, CD206+ tissue-resident macrophages, and a paucity of B lymphocytes when compared to peripheral blood. t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) revealed unique populations of decidual NK, T, DC and monocyte/macrophage subsets. Principal component analysis showed distinct spatial localization of decidual and circulating leukocytes contributed by NK and CD8+ T lymphocytes, and separation of decidua based on gestational age contributed by memory CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. Decidua from 10 ZIKV-infected dams obtained 16-56 days post infection at third (n=9) or second (n=1) trimester showed a significant reduction in frequency of activated, CXCR3+, and/or Granzyme B+ memory CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and Î³Î´ T compared to normal decidua. These data suggest that ZIKV induces local immunosuppression with reduced immune recruitment and impaired cytotoxicity. Our study adds to the immune characterization of the maternal-fetal interface in a translational nonhuman primate model of congenital infection and provides novel insight in to putative mechanisms of vertical transmission.","Moström, Matilda J; Scheef, Elizabeth A; Sprehe, Lesli M; Szeltner, Dawn; Tran, Dollnovan; Hennebold, Jon D; Roberts, Victoria H J; Maness, Nicholas J; Fahlberg, Marissa; Kaur, Amitinder",Front Immunol,331,16

The use of LUS is recommended to minimize transfers in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during the pandemic. The clinical efficacies of bedside chest X-ray (CXR) and LUS have not been compared in these patients. Herein, we demonstrated serial LUS changes in a 75-year-old woman recovering from COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in need of veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. LUS initially revealed extensive consolidation in the bilateral lower lung (BLL) fields with coalescent B-lines. While the patient recovered from ARDS, the findings gradually changed to discrete B-lines and small pleural consolidations. The LUS findings were more sensitive than those of the CXR in detecting re-expansion of the lungs by showing B-lines instead of consolidations in the BLL fields immediately after recruitment maneuver (RM). Compared with physiological parameters, LUS findings provided more precise information about the parts of the lungs that had been recruited by RM. Therefore, we encourage intensivists to extend their use of LUS in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and ARDS to acquire real-time information for a quick response and minimize the risk of viral transmission.","Hsiao, Yi-Han; Lin, Yi-Tsung; Liao, Hsien-Tzung; Yang, Kuang-Yao; Chen, Yuh-Min",J.

484407,484407,484407,Impact of COVID-19 on colorectal cancer early diagnosis pathway: retrospective cohort study,18.06068,7.238141,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) death rates in the countries of the West exceed those in the countries of the East by factors ranging from 10-1 to 100-1. In this paper, we refer to the West as represented by United States plus the five most populous countries of Western Europe, and the East as the 15 countries of East Asia and Oceania that are members of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). This paper argues that the currently available information points to the factors most responsible for this divide. Warnings by early January 2020 about an atypical viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China, prompted rapid responses in many jurisdictions in East Asia. Publication of the virus's genome on 10 January 2020 provided essential information for making diagnostic tests and launching vaccine development. China's lockdown of Wuhan on 23 January 2020 provided a final, decisive signal of the danger of the new disease. By late March 2020, China had fully controlled its epidemic, and many other RCEP countries had taken early and decisive measures that aborted serious outcomes. Delayed and halting responses in the United States and most other Western countries allowed the disease to take hold and spread. In both the East and the West, stringent population-wide non-pharmaceutical interventions were widely implemented at great cost to societies, economies, and school systems. Without these measures, the outcomes could have been even worse. Most countries in the East also implemented tightly focused policies to isolate infectious individuals. Even today, most countries in the West allow infectious individuals to mingle with their families, coworkers, and communities. Much of the East-West divide plausibly results from failure in the West to implement the basic public health policies of early action and the isolation of infectious individuals. Widespread immunization in high-income countries will soon attenuate their outbreaks, while the slow rollout of vaccines in lower income countries is replacing the East-West divide in outcomes with a North-South one. The South will then replace the West as the breeding ground for more contagious or pathogenic variants of the virus.","Jamison, Dean T; Wu, Kin Bing",,331,29

These stressors are laid on top of a resident selection process already under duress with exploding application and interview numbers-the latter likely to be exacerbated with the widespread shift to virtual interviewing. Leveraging their trainee perspective, the authors propose enforcing a cap on the number of interviews that applicants may attend through a novel interview ticket system (ITS). Specialties electing to participate in the ITS would select an evidence-based, specialty-specific interview cap. Applicants would then receive unique electronic tickets-equal in number to the cap-that would be given to participating programs at the time of an interview, when the tickets would be marked as used. The system would be self-enforcing and would ensure each interview represents genuine interest between applicant and program, while potentially increasing the number of interviews-and thus match rate-for less competitive applicants. Limitations of the ITS and alternative approaches for interview capping, including an honor code system, are also discussed. Finally, in the context of capped interview numbers, the authors emphasize the need for transparent pre-interview data from programs to inform applicants and their advisors on which interviews to attend; learning from prior experiences and studies on virtual interviewing; adherence to best practices for interviewing; and careful consideration of how virtual interviews may shift inequities in the resident selection process.","Burk-Rafel, Jesse; Standiford, Taylor",Acad. med,331,21

The mass testing needed to limit the spread of the virus requires new molecular diagnostic tests to dramatically widen access at the point-of-care in resource-limited settings. Isothermal molecular assays have emerged as a promising technology, given the faster turn-around time and minimal equipment compared to gold standard laboratory PCR methods. However, unlike PCR, they do not typically target multiple SARS-CoV-2 genes, risking sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, they often require multiple steps thus adding complexity and delays. Here we develop a multiplexed, 1-2 step, fast (20-30 min) SARS-CoV-2 molecular test using reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification to simultaneously detect two conserved targets - the E and RdRP genes. The agile multi-gene platform offers two complementary detection methods: real-time fluorescence or dipstick. The analytical sensitivity of the fluorescence test was 9.5 (95% CI: 7.0-18) RNA copies per reaction for the E gene and 17 (95% CI: 11-93) RNA copies per reaction for the RdRP gene. The analytical sensitivity for the dipstick method was 130 (95% CI: 82-500) RNA copies per reaction. High specificity was found against common seasonal coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV model samples. The dipstick readout demonstrated potential for point-of-care testing in decentralised settings, with minimal or equipment-free incubation methods and a user-friendly prototype smartphone application. This rapid, simple, ultrasensitive and multiplexed molecular test offers valuable advantages over gold standard tests and in future could be configurated to detect emerging variants of concern.","Cherkaoui, Dounia; Huang, Da; Miller, Benjamin S; Turbé, Valérian; McKendry, Rachel A",Biosens Bioelectron,331,32

Growing epidemiological studies have depicted atherosclerosis as a comorbid factor of COVID-19. Though both these diseases are triggered via inflammatory rage that leads to injury of healthy tissues, the molecular linkage between them and their co-influence in causing fatality is not yet understood. METHODS: We have retrieved the data of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for both atherosclerosis and COVID-19 from publicly available microarray and RNA-Seq datasets. We then reconstructed the protein-protein interaction networks (PPIN) for these diseases from protein-protein interaction data of corresponding DEGs. Using RegNetwork and TRRUST, we mapped the transcription factors (TFs) in atherosclerosis and their targets (TGs) in COVID-19 PPIN. RESULTS: From the atherosclerotic PPIN, we have identified 6 hubs (TLR2, TLR4, EGFR, SPI1, MYD88 and IRF8) as differentially expressed TFs that might control the expression of their 17 targets in COVID-19 PPIN. The important target proteins include IL1B, CCL5, ITGAM, IFIT3, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3 and CXCL8. Consequent functional enrichment analysis of these TGs have depicted inflammatory responses to be overrepresented among the gene sets. CONCLUSION: Finally, analyzing the DEGs in cardiomyocytes infected with SARS-CoV-2, we have concluded that MYD88 is a crucial linker of atherosclerosis and COVID-19, the co-existence of which lead to fatal outcomes. Anti-inflammatory therapy targeting MYD88 could be a potent strategy for combating this comorbidity.","Das, Deepyaman; Podder, Soumita",Comput Biol Med,331,33

METHODOLOGY: We compared POC-Ab with rRT-PCR results among patients in a tertiary hospital from January to March 2020 in Bandung, Indonesia. We selected presumptive COVID-19 patients with positive rRT-PCR consecutively and 20 patients with negative rRT-PCR results were selected randomly from the same group of patients as controls. We described the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) with corresponding 95% confidence interval using serum and capillary blood samples. We also tested POC-Ab using non-COVID-19 (confirmed dengue and typhoid) patients' sera. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients with positive rRT-PCR result and 20 negative controls were included (68.1% males, mean age 46 (SD: 15.4)). Using the serum, the sensitivity of the POC-Ab was 63.0% (42.4-80.6), specificity was 95.0% (75.1-99.9), PPV was 94.4% (72.7-99.8), NPV was 65.5% (45.7-82.1). A subset of 20 patients was tested using a capillary blood sample. The accuracy of the capillary blood sample is lower compared to serum (50.0% vs. 78.7%). None of the non-COVID-19 sera tested were reactive. CONCLUSIONS: POC-Ab for COVID-19 has a high specificity with no false-positive result in non-COVID-19 sera.

METHODS: This was a national cohort study of patients with early BC undergoing multidisciplinary team (MDT)-guided treatment recommendations during the pandemic, designated 'standard' or 'COVID-altered', in the preoperative, operative and post-operative setting. FINDINGS: Of 3776 patients (from 64 UK units) in the study, 2246 (59%) had 'COVID-altered' management. 'Bridging' endocrine therapy was used (n = 951) where theatre capacity was reduced. There was increasing access to COVID-19 low-risk theatres during the study period (59%). In line with national guidance, immediate breast reconstruction was avoided (n = 299). Where adjuvant chemotherapy was omitted (n = 81), the median benefit was only 3% (IQR 2-9%) using 'NHS Predict'. There was the rapid adoption of new evidence-based hypofractionated radiotherapy (n = 781, from 46 units). Only 14 patients (1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during their treatment journey. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of 'COVID-altered' management decisions were largely in line with pre-COVID evidence-based guidelines, implying that breast cancer survival outcomes are unlikely to be negatively impacted by the pandemic.

Using a large online sample from Canada and the United States, we will examine the effect of a three-week prosocial intervention on two indicators of emotional well-being (happiness and the belief that one's life is valuable) and mental health (anxiety and depression). Respondents will be randomly assigned to perform prosocial, self-focused, or neutral behaviors each week. Two weeks after the intervention, a final survey will assess whether the intervention has a lasting effect on mental health and emotional well-being.

We report a fatal case of COVID-19 pneumonia coinfected with HCoV-229E in Hong Kong. Genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E from a nasopharyngeal sample of the patient showed that the SARS-CoV-2 strain HK13 was most closely related to SARS-CoV-2 type strain Wuhan-Hu-1 (99.99% nucleotide identity), compatible with his recent history of travel to Wuhan. The HCoV-229E strain HK20-42 was most closely related to HCoV-229E strain SC0865 from the United States (99.86% nucleotide identity). To investigate if it may represent a newly emerged HCoV-229E genotype in Hong Kong, we retrieved 41 archived respiratory samples that tested positive for HCoV-229E from 2004 to 2019. Pneumonia and exacerbations of chronic airway diseases were common among infected patients. Complete RdRp, S, and N gene sequencing of the 41 HCoV-229E strains revealed that our contemporary HCoV-229E strains have undergone significant genetic drift with clustering of strains in chronological order. Two novel genogroups were identified, in addition to previously described genogroups 1 to 4, with recent circulating strains including strain HK20-42 belonging to novel genogroup 6. Positive selection was detected in the spike protein and receptor-binding domain, which may be important for viral evolution at the receptor-binding interphase. Molecular dating analysis showed that HCoV-229E shared the most recent common ancestor with bat and camel/alpaca 229E-related viruses at â¼1884, while camel/alpaca viruses had a relatively recent common ancestor at â¼1999. Further studies are required to ascertain the evolutionary origin and path of HCoV-229E.IMPORTANCE Since its first appearance in the 1960s, the genetic diversity and evolution of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) have been relatively understudied. In this study, we report a fatal case of COVID-19 coinfected with HCoV-229E in Hong Kong. Genome sequencing revealed that our SARS-CoV-2 strain is highly identical to the SARS-CoV-2 strain from Wuhan, compatible with the patient's recent travel history, whereas our HCoV-229E strain in this study is highly identical to a recent strain in the United States. We also retrieved 41 archived HCoV-229E strains from 2004 to 2019 in Hong Kong for sequence analysis. Pneumonia and exacerbations of chronic airway diseases were common diagnoses among the 41 patients. The results showed that HCoV-229E was evolving in chronological order. Two novel genogroups were identified in addition to the four preexisting HCoV-229E genogroups, with recent circulating strains belonging to novel genogroup 6.

Effective treatments of COVID-19 are urgently needed. This is the second edition of a living systematic review of randomized clinical trials assessing the effects of all treatment interventions for participants in all age groups with COVID-19. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We planned to conduct aggregate data meta-analyses, trial sequential analyses, network meta-analysis, and individual patient data meta-analyses. Our systematic review was based on PRISMA and Cochrane guidelines, and our eight-step procedure for better validation of clinical significance of meta-analysis results. We performed both fixed-effect and random-effects meta-analyses. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were admission to intensive care, mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, quality of life, and non-serious adverse events. According to the number of outcome comparisons, we adjusted our threshold for significance to p = 0.033. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. We searched relevant databases and websites for published and unpublished trials until November 2, 2020. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial methodology. We included 82 randomized clinical trials enrolling a total of 40,249 participants. 81 out of 82 trials were at overall high risk of bias. Meta-analyses showed no evidence of a difference between corticosteroids versus control on all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR] 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79 to 1.00; p = 0.05; I2 = 23.1%; eight trials; very low certainty), on serious adverse events (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.80 to 0.99; p = 0.04; I2 = 39.1%; eight trials; very low certainty), and on mechanical ventilation (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.55 to 1.33; p = 0.49; I2 = 55.3%; two trials; very low certainty). The fixed-effect meta-analyses showed indications of beneficial effects. Trial sequential analyses showed that the required information size for all three analyses was not reached. Meta-analysis (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.07; p = 0.31; I2 = 0%; four trials; moderate certainty) and trial sequential analysis (boundary for futility crossed) showed that we could reject that remdesivir versus control reduced the risk of death by 20%. Meta-analysis (RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.68 to 1.00; p = 0.05; I2 = 38.9%; four trials; very low certainty) and trial sequential analysis (required information size not reached) showed no evidence of difference between remdesivir versus control on serious adverse events. Fixed-effect meta-analysis showed indications of a beneficial effect of remdesivir on serious adverse events. Meta-analysis (RR 0.40; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.87; p = 0.02; I2 = 0%; two trials; very low certainty) showed evidence of a beneficial effect of intravenous immunoglobulin versus control on all-cause mortality, but trial sequential analysis (required information size not reached) showed that the result was severely underpowered to confirm or reject realistic intervention effects. Meta-analysis (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.35 to 1.14; p = 0.12; I2 = 77.4%; five trials; very low certainty) and trial sequential analysis (required information size not reached) showed no evidence of a difference between tocilizumab versus control on serious adverse events. Fixed-effect meta-analysis showed indications of a beneficial effect of tocilizumab on serious adverse events. Meta-analysis (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.51 to 0.96; p = 0.02; I2 = 0%; three trials; very low certainty) showed evidence of a beneficial effect of tocilizumab versus control on mechanical ventilation, but trial sequential analysis (required information size not reached) showed that the result was severely underpowered to confirm of reject realistic intervention effects. Meta-analysis (RR 0.32; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.69; p < 0.00; I2 = 0%; two trials; very low certainty) showed evidence of a beneficial effect of bromhexine versus standard care on non-serious adverse events, but trial sequential analysis (required information size not reached) showed that the result was severely underpowered to confirm or reject realistic intervention effects. Meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses (boundary for futility crossed) showed that we could reject that hydroxychloroquine versus control reduced the risk of death and serious adverse events by 20%. Meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses (boundary for futility crossed) showed that we could reject that lopinavir-ritonavir versus control reduced the risk of death, serious adverse events, and mechanical ventilation by 20%. All remaining outcome comparisons showed that we did not have enough information to confirm or reject realistic intervention effects. Nine single trials showed statistically significant results on our outcomes, but were underpowered to confirm or reject realistic intervention effects. Due to lack of data, it was not relevant to perform network meta-analysis or possible to perform individual patient data meta-analyses. CONCLUSIONS: No evidence-based treatment for COVID-19 currently exists. Very low certainty evidence indicates that corticosteroids might reduce the risk of death, serious adverse events, and mechanical ventilation; that remdesivir might reduce the risk of serious adverse events; that intravenous immunoglobin might reduce the risk of death and serious adverse events; that tocilizumab might reduce the risk of serious adverse events and mechanical ventilation; and that bromhexine might reduce the risk of non-serious adverse events. More trials with low risks of bias and random errors are urgently needed. This review will continuously inform best practice in treatment and clinical research of COVID-19.

A comprehensive understanding of possible causal pathways by which racism and discrimination lead to POCI's health disadvantages is a critical step toward reducing disparities and promoting health equity. Experimental methods can help researchers delineate these causal pathways. In this manuscript, we illustrate how virtual reality (VR) can be used by researchers in experimental studies to advance discrimination science. METHOD: We summarize current findings on the health effects of discrimination. We describe common methodological approaches that have been employed in discrimination science and discuss some of their limitations. Arguments for the potential benefits of using VR to advance discrimination science are provided. RESULTS: VR has the potential to facilitate ecologically valid experiments that examine individuals' responses to racism and discrimination-related experiences in real-time. CONCLUSIONS: VR offers scientists an innovative method that can be used in experimental studies to help delineate how racism and discrimination might lead to health problems in POCI. Still, VR is new to discrimination science; thus, research is necessary to empirically delineate the advantages and possible disadvantages of using VR in studies on discrimination.

Technologies can also be catalysts of change. While digital technologies are playing a vital role in tackling the covid-19 pandemic, the pandemic also presents a significant opportunity for digital technologies. Some experts believe the pandemic may permanently normalise the comprehensive societal use of digital technologies. This article casts a critical eye over the potential implications of this opportunity in the context of information systems (IS) research and development. We introduce and outline selected principles of Zygmunt Bauman's theory of liquid modernity. We then apply the liquid-modern principles to illustrative examples drawn from the covid-19 literature by focussing on three areas of established information systems interest: control, big data and information privacy. We show that traditional conceptualisations of scientific and societal order and control need to be reassessed; that big data alone cannot order clear and safe paths out of the current crisis and that information privacy regulations are irrelevant when undermined or circumvented by public and private actors. We conclude by making four recommendations for IS pandemic researchers and five practical recommendations in the context of the pandemic.","Doyle, Ronan; Conboy, Kieran",Int J Inf Manage,331,5

Furthermore, it is well known that proper nutrition can help support optimal immune function, reducing the impact of infections. Several vitamins and trace elements play an important role in supporting the cells of the immune system, thus increasing the resistance to infections. Other nutrients, such as omega-3 fatty acids, help sustain optimal function of the immune system. The main aim of this manuscript is to discuss of the potential role of micronutrients supplementation in supporting immunity, particularly against respiratory virus infections. Literature analysis showed that in vitro and observational studies, and clinical trials, highlight the important role of vitamins A, C, and D, omega-3 fatty acids, and zinc in modulating the immune response. Supplementation with vitamins, omega 3 fatty acids and zinc appears to be a safe and low-cost way to support optimal function of the immune system, with the potential to reduce the risk and consequences of infection, including viral respiratory infections. Supplementation should be in addition to a healthy diet and fall within recommended upper safety limits set by scientific expert bodies. Therefore, implementing an optimal nutrition, with micronutrients and omega-3 fatty acids supplementation, might be a cost-effective, underestimated strategy to help reduce the burden of infectious diseases worldwide, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Pecora, Francesco; Persico, Federica; Argentiero, Alberto; Neglia, Cosimo; Esposito, Susanna",Nutrients,331,29

With the advent of over-the-scope clip (OTSC), scope-induced perforations are increasingly managed conservatively, though there is no study comparing this form of non-surgical treatment with surgery. We aimed to compare OTSC and surgery in the management of scope-induced perforation of the duodenum. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data of scope-induced duodenal perforation patients. Perforations identified and treated within 24 h of procedure were analyzed. Factors analyzed were spectrum, etiology, baseline parameters, perforation size, outcome, comorbidities, and duration of hospital stay. RESULTS: A total of 25 patients had type I duodenal perforations, out of whom five were excluded due to delayed diagnosis and treatment. Of the twenty, eight were treated with OTSC placement while the rest underwent surgery. Age was comparable and the majority were females. Baseline parameters and comorbidities were similar in both the groups. The median size of perforation was 1.5 cm in both the OTSC group and the surgical group. All patients were treated with standard of care according to institutional protocols. Patients in the OTSC group were started orally after 48 h of OTSC placement, while in the surgery group median time to oral intake was 7 days. Two patients in the surgical group died while there was no mortality in the OTSC group (p = 0.48). Median hospital stay was shorter in the OTSC group (2 days vs. 22 days, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: OTSC is a feasible and better option in type I duodenal perforations with a shorter hospital stay.","Dahale, Amol S; Srivastava, Siddharth; Saluja, Sundeep Singh; Sachdeva, Sanjeev; Dalal, Ashok; Varakanahalli, Shivakumar",Indian j. gastroenterol,331,26

Vitamin D insufficiency has been suggested as a potential risk factor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, although its impact on the prognosis of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This multicenter prospective cohort study was designed to investigate whether serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration is associated with hospital length of stay and prognosis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 (n = 220) were recruited from 2 hospitals in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were categorized as follows: <10 ng/mL, 10 to <20 ng/mL, 20 to <30 ng/mL, and &#8805;30 ng/mL, and <10 ng/mL and &#8805;10 ng/mL. The primary outcome was hospital length of stay and the secondary outcomes were the rate of patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation and mortality. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in hospital length of stay when the 4 25(OH)D categories were compared (P = 0.120). Patients exhibiting 25(OH)D <10 ng/mL showed a trend (P = 0.057) for longer hospital length of stay compared with those with 25(OH)D &#8805;10 ng/mL [9.0 d (95% CI: 6.4, 11.6 d) vs. 7.0 d (95% CI: 6.6, 7.4 d)]. The multivariable Cox proportional hazard models showed no significant associations between 25(OH)D and primary or secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, those with severe 25(OH)D deficiency (<10 ng/mL) exhibited a trend for longer hospital length of stay compared with patients with higher 25(OH)D concentrations. This association was not significant in the multivariable Cox regression model. Prospective studies should test whether correcting severe 25(OH)D deficiency could improve the prognosis of patients with COVID-19.","Reis, Bruna Z; Fernandes, Alan L; Sales, Lucas P; Santos, Mayara D; Dos Santos, Caroline C; Pinto, Ana J; Goessler, Karla F; Franco, Andre S; Duran, Camila S C; Silva, Carla B R; Macêdo, Marina B; Dalmolin, Henrique H H; Baggio, Janaína; Balbi, Guilherme G M; Antonangelo, Leila; Caparbo, Valeria F; Gualano, Bruno; Murai, Igor H; Pereira, Rosa M R",Am. j. clin. nutr,331,16

Most African countries, even with their less advanced healthcare systems, continue to experience lower COVID-19 mortality rates. This was the case as the pandemic reached its first peak, plateaued, and declined. It is currently rising again in some countries, though not as rapidly as before. This study aimed to determine the predictors of COVID-19 mortality rate. This may help explain why Africa's COVID-19 mortality rate is, ironically, lower than that of more advanced countries with better health systems. This will also assist various governments in balancing their COVID-19 restrictive and socioeconomic measures. METHODOLOGY: This was an analytical review, which used pre-COVID-19 era population data and current COVID-19 mortality figures to determine predictors of COVID-19 mortality rates. Pearson's correlation was used to test the association between some population variables and COVID-19 mortality rates. Next, stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to determine significant predictors of COVID-19 mortality rates. RESULTS: Significant positive predictors of COVID-19 mortality rate included pre-COVID-19 era '65-yr+ mortality %' (R2 = 0.574, B = 2.86, p < 0.001), population mean age (R2 = 0.570, B = 4.77, p = 0.001), and life expectancy (R2 = 0.524, B = 1.67, p = 0.008). Pre-COVID-19 era CVD death rate was a negative predictor of COVID-19 mortality rate (R2 = 0.524, B = -0.584, p = 0.012). CONCLUSION: Africa's lower COVID-19 mortality rate is due to the lower population mean age, lower life expectancy, lower pre-COVID-19 era '65yr+ mortality rate', and smaller pool of people surviving and living with cardiovascular diseases.","Lawal, Yakubu",Int J Infect Dis,331,21
500617,500617,500617,Reflecting on a year filled with challenge and opportunity,18.163637,7.3185325,2020,"Novel mechanistic insights are discussed herein that link a single, nontoxic, low-dose radiotherapy (LDRT) treatment (0.5-1.0 Gy) to (1) beneficial subcellular effects mediated by the activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related transcription factor (Nrf2) and to (2) favorable clinical outcomes for COVID-19 pneumonia patients displaying symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We posit that the favorable clinical outcomes following LDRT result from potent Nrf2-mediated antioxidant responses that rebalance the oxidatively skewed redox states of immunological cells, driving them toward anti-inflammatory phenotypes. Activation of Nrf2 by ionizing radiation is highly dose dependent and conforms to the features of a biphasic (hormetic) dose-response. At the cellular and subcellular levels, hormetic doses of <1.0 Gy induce polarization shifts in the predominant population of lung macrophages, from an M1 pro-inflammatory to an M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype. Together, the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant responses and the subsequent shifts to anti-inflammatory phenotypes have the capacity to suppress cytokine storms, resolve inflammation, promote tissue repair, and prevent COVID-19-related mortality. Given these mechanistic considerations-and the historical clinical success of LDRT early in the 20th century-we opine that LDRT should be regarded as safe and effective for use at almost any stage of COVID-19 infection. In theory, however, optimal life-saving potential is thought to occur when LDRT is applied prior to the cytokine storms and before the patients are placed on mechanical oxygen ventilators. The administration of LDRT either as an intervention of last resort or too early in the disease progression may be far less effective in saving the lives of ARDS patients.","Calabrese, Edward J; Kozumbo, Walter J; Kapoor, Rachna; Dhawan, Gaurav; Lara, Pedro C; Giordano, James",Radiother Oncol,331,32

Stay-at-home orders and social distancing compounded with COVID-19 concerns have caused significant disruptions in daily life. One notable effect of these variables may be a change in the number of emergency department (ED) visits. This study aims to investigate the effects of COVID-19 on ED visits, and possible reasons for changes. METHODS: Retrospective analysis using CDC data for ED visits and percentage of visits for COVID-19-Like Illness (CLI) and Influenza-Like Illness (ILI). Google Trends was used to assess COVID-19 public awareness. Motor vehicle collision (MVC) data was collected from cities, which reported current data. A descriptive statistical analysis and two-sample t-test was performed on ED visit data to assess for significance and a descriptive analysis was conducted to assess COVID-19's impact on MVCs. RESULTS: The mean number of ED visits per week for the last four weeks of available data during the pandemic was significantly less than the four weeks prior to COVID-19 pandemic (pâ¯=â¯0.008). The ED visit decrease per week varied by region, with Region 1 having the greatest decrease (45%). MVCs decreased substantially across all cities studied, with New York City and Baton Rouge experiencing the greatest decrease (66%) during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: A number of factors have likely contributed to the substantial decrease in ED visits observed in this study. In light of these findings, it is important to raise patient awareness regarding acute conditions that are deadlier than COVID-19 and require immediate medical intervention to ensure recovery.","Boserup, Brad; McKenney, Mark; Elkbuli, Adel",Am J Emerg Med,331,16

Many theoretical models (such as Press-Schechter theory) are based on the notion that it could be universal, meaning independent of redshift and cosmology, when expressed in the appropriate variables. However, simulations exhibit persistent non-universalities in the mass functions of the virial mass and other commonly used spherical overdensity definitions. We systematically study the universality of mass functions over a wide range of mass definitions, for the first time including the recently proposed splashback mass, Msp. We confirm that, in LambdaCDM cosmologies, all mass definitions exhibit varying levels of non-universality that increase with peak height and reach between 20% and 500% at the highest masses we can test. Mvir, M200m, and Msp exhibit similar levels of non-universality. There are, however, two regimes where the splashback mass functions are significantly more universal. First, they are universal to 10% at z<2, whereas spherical overdensity definitions experience an evolution due to dark energy. Second, when additionally considering self-similar cosmologies with extreme power spectra, splashback mass functions are remarkably universal (to between 40% and 60%) whereas their spherical overdensity counterparts reach non-universalities between 180% and 450%. These results strongly support the notion that the splashback radius is a physically motivated definition of the halo boundary. We present a simple, universal fitting formula for splashback mass functions that accurately reproduces our simulation data.","Diemer, Benedikt",,331,29

There is still limited data comparing their respective long-term efficacy (>1 year). This study sought to compare the very long-term outcomes of AVNRT ablation using radiofrequency or cryotherapy. METHODS: We retrospectively included all patients who had undergone a first AVNRT ablation in our institution between January 2010 and December 2017. The primary endpoint was recurrence of documented AVNRT. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 409 patients (274 females, mean age 49.9 year-old). Ablation was performed using cryoenergy in 260 patients and radiofrequency in 149. High acute procedural success rate (> 98%) was obtained and no permanent AV block was observed using both techniques. During a mean follow-up of 3.3±2.3 years, documented AVNRT reccurence occurred in 24 (9.2%) and 4 patients (2.7%) in the cryoablation and radiofrequency group respectively. The risk of AVNRT recurrence was significantly higher in the CA group as compared to the RF group (Hazard Ratio = 3.7, 95% CI 1.3 to 5.9). Most of the recurrences after cryoablation occurred between 1- and 6-year follow-up (14/24; 58.3%), with 1/3rd of late recurrences after 3-year follow-up. In multivariable analysis, only Koch's triangle anatomical variant was associated with AVNRT recurrence after cryoablation (Hazard Ratio = 6.7, 95% CI 2.7-16.3). CONCLUSION: While AVNRT recurrence rates were similar at one year of follow-up regardless of the energy used, long-term efficacy appeared higher after radiofrequency ablation. Strikingly, recurrences occured much later after cryotherapy compared to radiofrequency ablation. This article is protected by copyright.

The objective is the minimisation of average zone pressure, while penalising deviations from a target chlorine concentration. We propose a tailored solution method based on tightened polyhedral relaxations and a heuristic method to compute good quality feasible solutions, with bounds on their level of sub-optimality. This is because off-the-shelf global optimisation solvers failed to compute feasible solutions for the considered non-convex mixed integer nonlinear program. The implemented methods are evaluated using three benchmarking water networks, and they are shown to outperform off-the-shelf solvers, for these case studies. The proposed heuristic has enabled the computation of good quality feasible solutions in the vast majority of the tested problem instances.","Pecci, Filippo; Stoianov, Ivan; Ostfeld, Avi",,331,1

All patients received the best supportive care and specific interventions that included the main drugs being tested for repurposing to treat COVID-19, such as hydroxychloroquine, anticoagulation and antiviral drugs, steroids, and interleukin-6 pathway inhibitors. Clinical, laboratory, and treatment characteristics were analyzed with univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods to explore their impact on in-hospital mortality. Univariate analyses showed prognostic significance for age greater than 70 years, the presence of two or more relevant comorbidities, a P/F ratio less than 200 at presentation, elevated LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) and CRP (C-reactive protein) values, intermediate- or therapeutic-dose anticoagulation, hydroxychloroquine, early antiviral therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir, short courses of steroids, and tocilizumab therapy. Multivariable regression confirmed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with age older than 70 years (OR 3.26) and a reduction in mortality for patients treated with anticoagulant (−0.37), antiviral lopinavir/ritonavir (−1.22), or steroid (−0.59) therapy. In contrast, hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab have not been confirmed to have a significant effect in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.

Due to Covid-19's severe economic impacts, the establishment of reliable determining factors can help to alleviate future pandemics. While a population density is often cited as a major determinant of infectious cases and mortality rates, there are both proponents and opponents to this claim. In this framework, the study seeks to assess the role of population density as a predictor of Covid-19 cases and deaths in Saudi Arabia and China during the Covid-19 pandemic. With high infectivity and mortality being a definitive characteristic of overpopulated regions, the authors propose that Henry Kissinger's population reduction theory can be applied as a control measure to control future pandemics and alleviate social concerns. If high-density Chinese regions are more susceptible to Covid-19 than low-density Saudi cities, the authors argue that Neo-Malthusian models can be used as a basis for reducing the impacts of the coronavirus disease on the economic growth in countries with low population density. However, the performed correlation analysis and simple linear regression produced controversial results with no clear connection between the three studied variables. By assessing population density as a determinant of health crises associated with multiple socio-economic threats and epidemiological concerns, the authors seek to reinvigorate the scholarly interest in Neo-Malthusian models as a long-term solution intended to mitigate future disasters.

Then they examine the importance of salient learning experiences that may inspire a commitment to championing social justice. Experiences in diverse communities can imbue medical students with a desire for lifelong learning and advocacy. The authors introduce a three-pillar framework that consists of trust building, structural competency, and cultural humility. They discuss how these pillars should underpin educational efforts to improve social determinants of health.

Taking into account the emotional deficiencies originated during the pandemic, among the most powerful tools to achieve engagement along with the identification, control and management of emotions is emotional intelligence (EI). The present study aims to establish the effect of the current confinement on the teaching-learning process and academic performance and the impact of the application of EI on university students. In total, 47 volunteers of the second course of the Degree in Pharmacy of the University of Granada (Spain) took part in this experience. Two temporary periods were established: at the beginning of the confinement period and after teaching several concepts of emotional intelligence online for two months. The Maslach Burnout Inventory-Student Survey Inventory (MBI-SS) and the Spanish version of Utrech Work Engagement Scale-Students (UWES-S) were used to evaluate the intervention. In total, 63.5% of the students presented academic burnout during the confinement before the intervention. After the EI workshops and seminars, only 31.1% presented academic burnout. Before the intervention with the emotional intelligence workshops, 44.6% experienced exhaustion, 41.7% cynicism and 60.3% felt it was ineffective in their academic performance. After the emotional intelligence workshops and seminars, 29.1% experienced exhaustion, 30.1% cynicism and 28.8% felt it was ineffective.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently defined the same phenomenon occurring in adults as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A) and emphasised on the use of antibody testing in this population. Here we describe an adult woman with an exposure to SARS-CoV-2 who presented with unexplained organ failure and shock. Positive antibody testing was the only clue to the diagnosis of MIS-A. We stress the importance of SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection in order to identify these cases.","Veyseh, Maedeh; Webster, Patrick; Blanco, Irene",BMJ case reports,331,24

Data on the interplay between metabolic comorbidities and the outcomes in patients with COVID-19 have been emerging and rapidly increasing. This implies a mechanistic link between metabolic diseases and COVID-19 resulting in the exacerbation of the condition. Nonetheless, new evidences are emerging to support insulin-mediated aggressive glucose-lowering treatment as a possible trigger of high mortality rate in diabetic COVID-19 patients, putting the clinician in a confounding and difficult dilemma for the treatment of COVID-19 patients with metabolic comorbidities. Thus, this review discusses the pathophysiological link among severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), metabolic complications, and severe inflammation in COVID-19 development, especially in those with multi-organ injuries. We discuss the influence of several routinely used drugs in COVID-19 patients, including anti-inflammatory and anti-coagulant drugs, antidiabetic drugs, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors. Especially, we provide a balanced overview on the clinical application of glucose-lowering drugs (insulin and metformin), angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers. Although there is insufficient evidence from clinical or basic research to comprehensively reveal the mechanistic link between adverse outcomes in COVID-19 and metabolic comorbidities, it is hoped that the update in the current review may help to better outline the optimal strategies for clinical management of COVID-19 patients with metabolic comorbidities.","Hua, Shuang; Yang, Yong; Zou, Danqi; Li, Jufei; Yan, Kaixuan; Xu, Ying; Jiang, Xue; Rong, Xianglu; Ye, Dewei",Biomed Pharmacother,331,16

Appropriate countermeasures mean thoughtful and educated choice of viral targets (epitopes). There are several articles that discuss such choices in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, other focus on phylogenetic traits and history of the Coronaviridae genome/proteome. However none consider viral protein low complexity regions (LCRs). Recently we created the first methods that are able to compare such fragments. RESULTS: We show that five low complexity regions (LCRs) in three proteins (nsp3, S and N) encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome are highly similar to regions from human proteome. As many as 21 predicted T-cell epitopes and 27 predicted B-cell epitopes overlap with the five SARS-CoV-2 LCRs similar to human proteins. Interestingly, replication proteins encoded in the central part of viral RNA are devoid of LCRs. CONCLUSIONS: Similarity of SARS-CoV-2 LCRs to human proteins may have implications on the ability of the virus to counteract immune defenses. The vaccine targeted LCRs may potentially be ineffective or alternatively lead to autoimmune diseases development. These findings are crucial to the process of selection of new epitopes for drugs or vaccines which should omit such regions.","Gruca, Aleksandra; Ziemska-Legiecka, Joanna; Jarnot, Patryk; Sarnowska, Elzbieta; Sarnowski, Tomasz J; Grynberg, Marcin",BMC Bioinformatics,331,16

To understand and explain this phenomenon, we seek guidance from a theoretical model that merges the risk information seeking and processing model and the theory of planned behavior. Furthermore, given the politicized nature of the pandemic in the U.S., we pose different information seeking patterns according to media partisanship, asserting that partisanship is likely to affect cognitive structures regarding COVID-19 decision making. Our results suggest two distinct routes for information seeking to decision-making. Conservative media use is directly associated with preventive behavior avoidance, while liberal media use is indirectly associated with preventive behavior engagement. This work contributes to our collective understanding of what drives preventive behaviors in the context of health risk, particularly in the case of a highly politicized national health crisis with global implications.","Moon, Won-Ki; Atkinson, Lucy; Kahlor, Lee Ann; Yun, Chungin; Son, Hyunsang",Health Commun,331,16

Only efficacy data according to the European Norms (EN) were found. The bactericidal efficacy of the original formulations was, under practical conditions, partly insufficient (EN 1500, only effective in 60 s; EN 12791, efficacy too low in 5 min). The first modification with higher alcohol concentrations improves their efficacy as hygienic hand rub (effective in 30 s). The second (0.725% glycerol) and third (0.5% glycerol) modification improves their efficacy for surgical hand preparation (effective in 5 and 3 min). The original and second modified formulations were tested and demonstrate activity against enveloped viruses including severe acute resiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 30 s. The ethanol-based formulation is also active against some non-enveloped test viruses in 60 s (suspension tests, EN 14476).

The NCT03055715 study of the Young DEGRO working group of the German Society of Radiation Oncology (DEGRO) evaluated the prognostic impact of GTV and its changes during RCT. METHODS: A total of 21 university centers for radiation oncology from five different European countries (Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Belgium, and Austria) participated in the study which evaluated nâ¯= 347 patients with confirmed (biopsy) inoperable NSCLC in UICC stage III A/B who received radical curative-intent RCT between 2010 and 2013. Patient and disease data were collected anonymously via electronic case report forms and entered into the multi-institutional RadPlanBio platform for central data analysis. GTV before RCT (initial planning CT, GTV1) and at 40-50â¯Gy (re-planning CT for radiation boost, GTV2) was delineated. Absolute GTV before/during RCT and relative GTV changes were correlated with overall survival as the primary endpoint. Hazard ratios (HR) of survival analysis were estimated by means of adjusted Cox regression models. RESULTS: GTV1 was found to have a mean of 154.4â¯ml (95%CI: 1.5-877) and GTV2 of 106.2â¯ml (95% CI: 0.5-589.5), resulting in an estimated reduction of 48.2â¯ml (pâ¯< 0.001). Median overall survival (OS) was 18.8 months with a median of 22.1, 20.9, and 12.6 months for patients with high, intermediate, and low GTV before RT. Considering all patients, in one survival model of overall mortality, GTV2 (2.75 (1.12-6.75, pâ¯= 0.03) was found to be a stronger survival predictor than GTV1 (1.34 (0.9-2, pâ¯> 0.05). In patients with available data on both GTV1 and GTV2, absolute GTV1 before RT was not significantly associated with survival (HR 0-69, 0.32-1.49, pâ¯> 0.05) but GTV2 significantly predicted OS in a model adjusted for age, T stage, and chemotherapy, with an HR of 3.7 (1.01-13.53, pâ¯= 0.04) per 300â¯ml. The absolute decrease from GTV1 to GTV2 was correlated to survival, where every decrease by 50â¯ml reduced the HR by 0.8 (CI 0.64-0.99, pâ¯= 0.04). There was no evidence for a survival effect of the relative change between GTV1 and GTV2. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that independently of T stage, the re-planning GTV during RCT is a significant and superior survival predictor compared to baseline GTV before RT. Patients with a high absolute (rather than relative) change in GTV during RT show a superior survival outcome after RCT.","Ostheimer, C; Mäurer, M; Ebert, N; Schmitt, D; Krug, D; Baumann, R; Henkenberens, C; Giordano, F A; Sautter, L; López, Guerra; Fleischmann, D F; Niyazi, M; Käsmann, L; Kaul, D; Thieme, A H; Billiet, C; Dobiasch, S; Arnold, C R; Oertel, M; Haussmann, J; Gauer, T; Goy, Y; Suess, C; Ziegler, S; Panje, C M; Baues, C; Trommer-Nestler, M; Skripcak, T; Medenwald, D",Strahlenther.

The response strategy included early diagnosis, patient isolation, symptomatic monitoring of contacts as well as suspected and confirmed cases, and public health quarantine. In this context, telemedicine, particularly video consultations, has been promoted and scaled up to reduce the risk of transmission, especially in the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Based on a literature review, the first conceptual framework for telemedicine implementation during outbreaks was published in 2015. An updated framework for telemedicine in the COVID-19 pandemic has been defined. This framework could be applied at a large scale to improve the national public health response. Most countries, however, lack a regulatory framework to authorize, integrate, and reimburse telemedicine services, including in emergency and outbreak situations. In this context, Italy does not include telemedicine in the essential levels of care granted to all citizens within the National Health Service, while France authorized, reimbursed, and actively promoted the use of telemedicine. Several challenges remain for the global use and integration of telemedicine into the public health response to COVID-19 and future outbreaks. All stakeholders are encouraged to address the challenges and collaborate to promote the safe and evidence-based use of telemedicine during the current pandemic and future outbreaks. For countries without integrated telemedicine in their national health care system, the COVID-19 pandemic is a call to adopt the necessary regulatory frameworks for supporting wide adoption of telemedicine.","Ohannessian, Robin; Duong, Tu Anh; Odone, Anna",JMIR Public Health Surveill,331,6

The mechanical properties of the AM1 ensemble in the cohesive film state are qualitatively equivalent to the protein ß-LG, while in the mobile detergent state they are equivalent to the low molecular weight surfactant, SDS. In this work the foaming properties of AM1 are compared to those of ß-LG and SDS at the same weight concentration and it is found that AM1 adsorbs rapidly to the interface, initially forming a dense foam like that formed by SDS and superior to ß-LG. In addition, under solution conditions where interfacially adsorbed AM1 forms a cohesive film state the foam stability is high, comparable to ß-LG. However when the interfacially adsorbed AM1 forms a foam under detergent-state conditions, the foam stability is poor. We have achieved control of foam stability through the design of a peptide that exhibits stimuli-responsive changes in the extent of intermolecular interactions between peptide molecules adsorbed at the air-water interface.

Although adding salt is a generally recognized strategy to improve protein stability, this improvement does not necessarily occur. The lack of an effect upon the addition of salt was previously confirmed for the tenth fibronectin type III domain from human fibronectin (FN3) by thermal stability analysis. However, the detailed molecular mechanism is unknown. In the present study, by employing the negatively charged carboxyl triad on the surface of FN3 as a case study, the molecular mechanism of the inefficient NaCl effect on protein stability was experimentally addressed using spectroscopic methods. Complementary analysis using Raman spectroscopy and 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid fluorescence revealed the three-phase behavior of the salt-protein interaction between NaCl and FN3 over a wide salt concentration range from 100 mM to 4.0 M, suggesting that the Na+-specific binding to the negatively charged carboxyl triad causes a local conformational change around the binding site with an accompanying structural change in the overall protein, which contributes to the protein's structural destabilization. This spectroscopic evidence clarifies the molecular understanding of the inefficiency of salt to improve protein stability. The findings will inform the optimization of formulation conditions.","Ota, Chikashi; Fukuda, Yui; Tanaka, Shun-Ichi; Takano, Kazufumi",Langmuir,331,31

Overnight, social work intervention models provided in-person gave way to the utilization of Information and Communication Technologies to facilitate direct practice in virtual environments (e-therapy). Social work's slow acceptance of e-therapy prior to the pandemic resulted in a lack of training for many social work practitioners and MSW student interns, who were required to make rapid transitions to using and operating in online environments. It appears likely that e-therapy will continue after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, so integrating education about effective e-therapy techniques into social work curricula seems like a logical next step. A social worker's ability to establish the therapeutic alliance, which is at the heart of all helping relationships, will be central to this curricula. Understanding social work students' perceptions of e-therapy and the therapeutic alliance can help shape the development of this new curriculum. Using internal student email, students at two Research I universities were invited to participate in a fully online anonymous survey dealing with attitudes towards e-therapy and the therapeutic alliance. Surveys were conducted in 2018 and April-May 2020.

Media play a critical role during pandemics by affecting values, opinions, public knowledge about stigmatized groups. When media ignore and stereotypically represent a social group, the social value of the group decreases, and their problems are trivialized. METHOD: I analyzed data provided by Media Monitoring Center which is an independent media company in Turkey. Sample was selected to reveal news representation of Syrian refugees between March 11, 2020 (the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Turkey) and August 20, 2020 (the time of this research). Mostly watched television evening (prime) news, the most widely circulated newspapers, and the most visited online news platforms were analyzed. By using content analysis method, the news stories about Syrian refugees were examined. RESULTS: It has been revealed that Turkish news media overwhelmingly acclaimed for Turkey's polices on Syrian refugees and the criticized the European Union policies towards refugees in the news stories. Even though almost 4 million Syrian refugees live in Turkey, with the largest refugee population in the world, Turkish news media ignored the plight of Syrian refugees. CONCLUSION: Results of the study demonstrate that Syrian refugees were symbolically annihilated by Turkish news media during the COVID-19 pandemic. The concealment of information and symbolic annihilation of disadvantaged groups could potentially cause health disparities and irreparable harm to public health. Moreover, inequities exacerbate when predicaments of stigmatized groups are ignored in the news media. Further studies are needed to reveal the impact of the media on health disparities among stigmatized groups during the pandemics.","Yücel, Alev",Int J Equity Health,331,1

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was proved to be the main agent of COVID-19. In the present study, we conducted an in depth analysis of the SARS-COV-2 nucleocapsid to identify potential targets that may allow identification of therapeutic targets. METHODS: The SARS-COV-2 N protein subcellular localization and physicochemical property was analyzed by PSORT II Prediction and ProtParam tool. Then SOPMA tool and swiss-model was applied to analyze the structure of N protein. Next, the biological function was explored by mass spectrometry analysis and flow cytometry. At last, its potential phosphorylation sites were analyzed by NetPhos3.1 Server and PROVEAN PROTEIN. RESULTS: SARS-COV-2 N protein composed of 419 aa, is a 45.6 kDa positively charged unstable hydrophobic protein. It has 91 and 49% similarity to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and is predicted to be predominantly a nuclear protein. It mainly contains random coil (55.13%) of which the tertiary structure was further determined with high reliability (95.76%). Cells transfected with SARS-COV-2 N protein usually show a G1/S phase block company with an increased expression of TUBA1C, TUBB6. At last, our analysis of SARS-COV-2 N protein predicted a total number of 12 phosphorylated sites and 9 potential protein kinases which would significantly affect SARS-COV-2 N protein function. CONCLUSION: In this study, we report the physicochemical properties, subcellular localization, and biological function of SARS-COV-2 N protein. The 12 phosphorylated sites and 9 potential protein kinase sites in SARS-COV-2 N protein may serve as promising targets for drug discovery and development for of a recombinant virus vaccine.","Gao, Tianyi; Gao, Yingdong; Liu, Xiangxiang; Nie, Zhenlin; Sun, Huilin; Lin, Kang; Peng, Hongxin; Wang, Shukui",BMC Microbiol,331,33

Indeed, there is urgent need to develop and deploy robust diagnostic methodologies not only to use in health laboratory environments but also directly in places where humans circulate and spread the virus such as airports, trains, boats, and any public aggregation places. The success of a reliable and sensitive asymptomatic diagnosis relies on the identification and measurement of informative biomarkers from human host and virus in a rapid, sensitive, and inexpensive manner. The objective of this article is to describe an innovative multidisciplinary approach to develop an efficient, inexpensive, and easy-to-use portable instrument (bCUBE® by Hyris Ltd) that can be employed as a surveillance system for the emergency caused by SARS-CoV-2. A solution for Coronavirus testing, compliant with CDC guidelines, is scheduled to be released in the next weeks. In addition, we will describe a workflow and path of an integrated multi-omic approach that will lead to host and pathogen biomarker discovery in order to train the instrument to provide reliable results based on a specific biomarker's fingerprint of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Martinelli, Federico; Perrone, Anna; Della Noce, Isabella; Colombo, Lorenzo; Lo Priore, Stefano; Romano, Simone",Immunol Rev,331,24

During 25-week observation period (16 March-6 September 2020), we included 404 residents (118 children), and 1643 caregivers. We compare strategies for infection prevention, control, and containment, and related outcomes, across four UK long-term care facilities. Strategies included early on-site enhancement of preventative and infection control measures, early identification and isolation of symptomatic cases, contact tracing, mass surveillance of asymptomatic cases and contacts. We measured infection rate among vulnerable people living in the facilities and their caregivers, with asymptomatic and symptomatic cases, including fatality rate. We report 38 individuals (17 residents) who tested severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive, with outbreaks amongst residents in two facilities. At Chalfont Centre for Epilepsy (CCE), 10/98 residents tested positive: two symptomatic (one died), eight asymptomatic on weekly enhanced surveillance; 2/275 caregivers tested positive: one symptomatic, one asymptomatic. At St Elizabeth's (STE), 7/146 residents tested positive: four symptomatic (one died), one positive during hospital admission for symptoms unrelated to COVID-19, two asymptomatic on one-off testing of all 146 residents; 106/601 symptomatic caregivers were tested, 13 positive. In addition, during two cycles of systematically testing all asymptomatic carers, four tested positive. At The Meath (TM), 8/80 residents were symptomatic but none tested; 26/250 caregivers were tested, two positive. At Young Epilepsy (YE), 8/80 children were tested, all negative; 22/517 caregivers were tested, one positive. Infection outbreaks in long-term care facilities for vulnerable people with epilepsy can be quickly contained, but only if asymptomatic individuals are identified through enhanced surveillance at resident and caregiver level. We observed a low rate of morbidity and mortality, which confirmed that preventative measures with isolation of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 residents can reduce resident-to-resident and resident-to-caregiver transmission. Children and young adults appear to have lower infection rates. Even in people with epilepsy and multiple co-morbidities, we observed a high percentage of asymptomatic people suggesting that epilepsy-related factors (anti-seizure medications and seizures) do not necessarily lead to poor outcomes.","Balestrini, Simona; Koepp, Matthias J; Gandhi, Sonia; Rickman, Hannah M; Shin, Gee Yen; Houlihan, Catherine F; Anders-Cannon, Jonny; Silvennoinen, Katri; Xiao, Fenglai; Zagaglia, Sara; Hudgell, Kirsty; Ziomek, Mariusz; Haimes, Paul; Sampson, Adam; Parker, Annie; Helen Cross, J; Pardington, Rosemarie; Nastouli, Eleni; Swanton, Charles; Sander, Josemir W; Sisodiya, Sanjay M",Epilepsy Behav,331,16

It is thus urgent to predict the development and spread of the epidemic. In this paper, we have developed a forecasting model of COVID-19 by using a deep learning method with rolling update mechanism based on the epidemical data provided by Johns Hopkins University. First, as traditional epidemical models use the accumulative confirmed cases for training, it can only predict a rising trend of the epidemic and cannot predict when the epidemic will decline or end, an improved model is built based on long short-term memory (LSTM) with daily confirmed cases training set. Second, considering the existing forecasting model based on LSTM can only predict the epidemic trend within the next 30 days accurately, the rolling update mechanism is embedded with LSTM for long-term projections. Third, by introducing Diffusion Index (DI), the effectiveness of preventive measures like social isolation and lockdown on the spread of COVID-19 is analyzed in our novel research. The trends of the epidemic in 150 days ahead are modeled for Russia, Peru and Iran, three countries on different continents. Under our estimation, the current epidemic in Peru is predicted to continue until November 2020. The number of positive cases per day in Iran is expected to fall below 1000 by mid-November, with a gradual downward trend expected after several smaller peaks from July to September, while there will still be more than 2000 increase by early December in Russia. Moreover, our study highlights the importance of preventive measures which have been taken by the government, which shows that the strict controlment can significantly reduce the spread of COVID-19.","Wang, Peipei; Zheng, Xinqi; Ai, Gang; Liu, Dongya; Zhu, Bangren",Chaos Solitons Fractals,331,1

We use retrospective methodology to collect available data on early sign and symptoms of Covid-19 through accessing World Health Organization (WHO) webpages, New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), Nature Journal, Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA) network, British Medical Journal (BJM), Lancet and other world renowned journal publications to establish a relationship of early symptoms for detection of Covid-19. Data of 2707 Covid-19 laboratory confirmed cases was collected and analyzed for early signs. Available data was categorized into physical and blood biomarkers. This categorized data was assessed for scoring early detection of Covid-19 by scoring Hashmi-Asif Covid-19 formula. Each characteristic was given a score in Hashmi-Asif Covid-19 chart with maximum score of 28. Scoring 16 on chart means Covid-19 will fully develop in near future.

Understanding the prevalence of and factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among frontline HCP who care for COVID-19 patients are important for protecting both HCP and their patients. During April 3-June 19, 2020, serum specimens were collected from a convenience sample of frontline HCP who worked with COVID-19 patients at 13 geographically diverse academic medical centers in the United States, and specimens were tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Participants were asked about potential symptoms of COVID-19 experienced since February 1, 2020, previous testing for acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, and their use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the past week. Among 3,248 participants, 194 (6.0%) had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Seroprevalence by hospital ranged from 0.8% to 31.2% (median = 3.6%).

The dataset that underpins this article includes empirical research that was conducted on-site over two months in a Non-Government Organization (NGO) vocational hospitality school strategically located in the tourist district of Siem Reap, Cambodia. In addition to hospitality skills training, the NGO supported the human development of the students through a capabilities approach. The rights based, participatory research enquires into the lived experiences of one cohort of students who migrated to Siem Reap from poor rural communities to find employment and escape poverty and hunger. Results conclude that students faced competing demands between their gendered, traditional cultural values and the experiences of equity and empowerment provided in their hospitality training. Conclusions drawn through the student's narratives facilitate a deeper understanding of the lived experiences of impoverished migrant youth in Siem Reap and contribute to a better understanding of the human development impact of vocational training through a capabilities approach.

In fact, economic and financial behaviors, and specifically, which goods and services citizens purchase and how they allocate their spending, are playing a central role in planning targeted services. In this context, cashless payments provide an invaluable data source to identify such spending behaviors. In this work, we propose a methodology to extract the consumption behaviors of a large sample of customers through credit card transaction data. The main outcome of the methodology is a concise representation of the economic behavior of people residing in a city, the so-called city consumption profile. We inferred the city consumption profile from a network-based representation of the similarity among the customers in terms of purchase allocation; on top of which we applied a community detection algorithm to identify the representative consumption profiles. By applying the above methodology to a set of credit card transactions of an Italian financial group, we showed that cities, even geographically close, exhibit different profiles which makes them unique. Specifically, usage patterns focused on a single type of good/service—mono-categorical consumption profile—are the main factors leading to the differences in the city profiles. Our analysis also showed that there is a group of consumption profiles common to all cities, made up by purchases of primary goods/services, such as food or clothing. In general, the city consumption profile represents a tool for understanding the economic behaviors of the citizens and for comparing different cities. Moreover, city planners and managers may use it in the outline of city services tailored to the citizens’ needs.","Galdeman, Alessia; Ba, Cheick T.; Zignani, Matteo; Quadri, Christian; Gaito, Sabrina",Appl Netw Sci,331,12

Thus, work–life balance (WLB) of mothers may influence their children’s mental health and lifestyle. This study aims to clarify the relationship between parents’ WLB and children’s mental health, as well as the underlying factors of parental stress and nurturing attitude. The study is based on a questionnaire survey administered in 2019 to fifth-grade elementary school students and their caregivers in Aichi Prefecture, Japan. The regression results indicated that the higher the work–family negative spillover, the higher the child’s externalizing and internalizing problems, and the higher the positive spillover, the lower the problems and the higher the prosocial behaviors. Path analysis indicates that maternal WLB is negatively and positively related to children’s behavior through maternal stress and parenting practices. The study suggests that maternal WLB is related to children’s emotional and behavioral problems.

To better understand the emotional and behavioral consequences of the public health policies implemented to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in PwPD, and to explore the factors contributing to accessing alternative health care mechanisms, such as telehealth, we administered an anonymous knowledge, attitude, and practice survey to PwPD and care partners, via the mailing lists of the Parkinson’s Foundation and Columbia University Parkinson’s Disease Center of Excellence with an average response rate of 19.3%. Sufficient information was provided by 1,342 PwPD to be included in the final analysis. Approximately half of respondents reported a negative change in PD symptoms, with 45–66% reporting mood disturbances. Telehealth use increased from 9.7% prior to the pandemic to 63.5% during the pandemic. Higher income and higher education were associated with telehealth use. Services were more often used for doctor’s appointment than physical, occupational, speech, or mental health therapies. Almost half (46%) of PwPD preferred to continue using telehealth always or sometimes after the coronavirus outbreak had ended. Having received support/instruction for telehealth and having a care partner, friend, or family member to help them with the telehealth visit increased the likelihood of continuous use of telehealth after the pandemic ended. Taken together, PD symptoms and management practices were markedly affected by COVID-19.

The evolution of the DNA is too complex to be characterized by a few parameters. Therefore, there is a need for a modeling approach for analyzing DNA patterns. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework for DNA pattern analysis. The proposed framework consists of two main stages. The first stage is for analyzing the DNA sequences evolution, whereas the other stage is for the reconstruction process. We utilized cellular automata (CA) rules for analyzing and predicting the DNA sequence. Then, a modified procedure for the reconstruction process is introduced, which is based on the Probabilistic Cellular Automata (PCA) integrated with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. This integration makes the proposed framework more efficient and achieves optimum transition rules. Our innovated model leans on the hypothesis that mutations are probabilistic events. As a result, their evolution can be simulated as a PCA model. The main objective of this paper is to analyze various DNA sequences to predict the changes that occur in DNA during evolution (mutations). We used a similarity score as a fitness measure to detect symmetry relations, which is appropriate for numerous extremely long sequences. Results are given for the CpG-methylation-deamination processes, which are regions of DNA where a guanine nucleotide follows a cytosine nucleotide in the linear sequence of bases. The DNA evolution is handled as the evolved colored paradigms. Therefore, incorporating probabilistic components help to produce a tool capable of foretelling the likelihood of specific mutations. Besides, it shows their capabilities in dealing with complex relations.","Elsayed, Wesam M.; Elmogy, Mohammed; El-Desouky, B.S.",Inf Sci (N Y),331,20

Stringent physical distancing recommendations and shelter-in-place were first introduced in the hardest-hit provinces, and by March, these recommendations were uniform throughout the country. In the presence of an evolving and deadly pandemic, we sought to investigate the impact of this pandemic on individual well-being and prevention practices among Chinese urban residents. From March 2–11, 2020, 4607 individuals were recruited from 11 provinces with varying numbers of COVID-19 cases using the social networking app WeChat to complete a brief, anonymous, online survey. The analytical sample was restricted to 2551 urban residents. Standardized scales measured generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), the primary outcome. Multiple logistic regression was conducted to identify correlates of GAD alongside assessment of community practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the recommended public health practices significantly (p < 0.001) increased, including wearing facial mask, practicing physical distancing, handwashing, decreased public spitting, and going outside in urban communities. Overall, 40.3% of participants met screening criteria for GAD and 49.3%, 62.6%, and 55.4% reported that their work, social life, and family life were interrupted by anxious feelings, respectively. Independent correlates of having anxiety symptoms included being a healthcare provider (aOR = 1.58, p < 0.01), living in regions with a higher density of COVID-19 cases (aOR = 2.13, p < 0.01), having completed college (aOR = 1.38, p = 0.03), meeting screening criteria for depression (aOR = 6.03, p < 0.01), and poorer perceived health status (aOR = 1.54, p < 0.01). COVID-19 had a profound impact on the health of urban dwellers throughout China. Not only did they markedly increase their self- and community-protective behaviors, but they also experienced high levels of anxiety associated with a heightened vulnerability like depression, having poor perceived health, and the potential of increased exposure to COVID-19 such as living closer to the epicenter of the pandemic.

However, vaccines per se do not save lives and restart economies. Their success depends on the number of people getting vaccinated. We used a survey experiment to examine the impact on vaccine intentions of a variety of public health messages identified as particularly promising: three messages that emphasize different benefits from the vaccines (personal health, the health of others, and the recovery of local and national economies) and one message that emphasizes vaccine safety. Because people will likely be exposed to multiple messages in the real world, we also examined the effect of these messages in combination.

The reason behind this may the complex web of highly intertwined pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in the SARS-CoV-2 infection and the corresponding human systemic response, leading to end-organ damage, disability, and death. Colchicine, high-dose aspirin, and montelukast are being investigated currently as potential modulators of AMIS-COVID-19 in patients who fail to improve with traditional therapeutic approaches. Here, we present a patient who presented with high fevers, extreme fatigue and dyspnea, and ongoing deterioration. As part of our clinical approach, we used the simultaneous combination of the three agents listed above, capitalizing on their different respective mechanisms of action against AMIS-COVID-19. Following the initiation of therapy, the patient showed symptomatic improvement within 24 h, with the ability to return to daily activities after 72 h of continued triple-agent approach. Based on this experience, we have reviewed the immunomodulatory basis of this regimen, including potential avenues in which it may prevent the development of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and its clinical manifestation, AMIS-COVID-19. By blocking the early stages of an inflammatory response, via diverse mechanistic pathways, the regimen in question may prove effective in halting the escalation of CRS and AMIS-COVID-19 in acutely symptomatic, nonimproving COVID-19 patients.","Downing, Sean; Chauhan, Vivek; Chaudry, Irshad H.; Galwankar, Sagar; Sharma, Pushpa; Stawicki, Stanislaw P.",J Glob Infect Dis,331,10

It is recognized as a serious problem in Plasmodium falciparum–endemic sub-Saharan Africa, where recent data suggests that it is more common than previously believed. In such regions where malaria transmission is high, neonates may be protected from disease caused by congenital malaria through the transfer of maternal antibodies against the parasite. However, in low P. vivax–endemic regions, immunity to vivax malaria is low; thus, there is the likelihood that congenital vivax malaria poses a more significant threat to newborn health. Malaria had previously been a major parasitic disease in China, and congenital malaria case reports in Chinese offer valuable information for understanding the risks posed by congenital malaria to neonatal health. As most of the literature documenting congenital malaria cases in China are written in Chinese and therefore are not easily accessible to the global malaria research community, we have undertaken an extensive review of the Chinese literature on this subject. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we reviewed congenital malaria cases from three major searchable Chinese journal databases, concentrating on data from 1915 through 2011. Following extensive screening, a total of 104 cases of congenital malaria were identified. These cases were distributed mainly in the eastern, central, and southern regions of China, as well as in the low-lying region of southwest China. The dominant species was P. vivax (92.50%), reflecting the malaria parasite species distribution in China. The leading clinical presentation was fever, and other clinical presentations were anaemia, jaundice, paleness, diarrhoea, vomiting, and general weakness. With the exception of two cases, all patients were cured with antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine, quinine, artemether, and artesunate. CONCLUSIONS: The symptoms of congenital malaria vary significantly between cases, so clear and early diagnosis is difficult. We suggest that active surveillance might be necessary for neonates born to mothers with a history of malaria.","Tao, Zhi-yong; Fang, Qiang; Liu, Xue; Culleton, Richard; Tao, Li; Xia, Hui; Gao, Qi",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,331,24

Methods We present single-center data of 1,516 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at the Medical College of Wisconsin (Milwaukee, WI, USA) between March 13, 2020 and June 11, 2020. Results During the study period, 53 bronchoscopy procedures were performed at the institution, of which five patients tested positive for COVID-19. Of the five patients, three underwent BAL testing based on high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 after the nasopharyngeal (NP) swab(s) was negative. All three patients had underlying cancers and had lymphopenia for a considerable duration prior to being diagnosed with COVID-19. Two patients had better outcomes that could be attributed to earlier BAL specimen testing resulting in timely medical intervention. Conclusion This study underscores the need for early lower respiratory tract sampling, whenever possible, in patients with cancer and prolonged lymphopenia. High clinical suspicion ought to supersede false-negative NP reverse transcriptase–PCR as early bronchoscopic evaluation in cancer patients, who are either receiving active treatment or are immunosuppressed, can allow timely institution of efficacious treatment, enrollment into clinical trials, as well as effective infection control.

These tests differ between one another in several ways. Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of currently available SARS-CoV-2 serological tests, and assessed their real-world performance under scenarios of varying proportion of infected individuals. We included independent studies that specified the antigen used for antibody detection and used quantitative methods. We identified nine independent studies, of which six were based on commercial ELISA or CMIA/CLIA assays, and three on in-house tests. Test sensitivity ranged from 68% to 93% for IgM, from 65% to 100% for IgG, and from 83% to 98% for total antibodies. Random-effects models yielded a summary sensitivity of 82% (95%CI 75-88%) for IgM, and 85% for both IgG (95%CI 73-93%) and total antibodies (95%CI 74-94%). Specificity was very high for most tests, and its pooled estimate was 98% (95%CI 92-100%) for IgM and 99% (95%CI 98-100%) for both IgG and total antibodies. The heterogeneity of sensitivity and specificity across tests was generally high (I2[≤]50%). In populations with a low prevalence ([≤]5%) of seroconverted individuals, the positive predictive value would be [≤]88% for most assays, except those reporting perfect specificity.

Yet many of these are expensive, in limited supply, and not necessarily validated specifically for viral RNA. While saliva is a promising sample type as it can be reliably self-collected for the sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2, the expense and availability of these collection tubes are prohibitive to mass testing efforts. Therefore, we investigated the stability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and infectious virus detection from saliva without supplementation. We tested RNA stability over extended periods of time (2-25 days) and at temperatures representing at-home storage and elevated temperatures which might be experienced when cold chain transport may be unavailable. We found SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva from infected individuals is stable at 4°C, room temperature (~19°C), and 30°C for prolonged periods and found limited evidence for viral replication in stored saliva samples. This work demonstrates that expensive saliva collection options involving RNA stabilization and virus inactivation buffers are not always needed, permitting the use of cheaper collection options.

The association of respiratory diseases and smoking, both highly prevalent globally, with COVID-19 severity has not been elucidated. Given the gap in the evidence and the growing prevalence of COVID-19, the objective of this study was to explore the association of underlying respiratory diseases and smoking with severe outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection. METHODS: A systematic search was performed to identify studies reporting prevalence of respiratory diseases and/or smoking in relation with disease severity in patients with confirm COVID-19, published between January 1 to April 15, 2020 in English language. Pooled odds-ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. FINDINGS: Twenty two studies met the inclusion criteria. All the studies presented data of 13,184 COVID-19 patients (55% males). Patients with severe outcomes were older and a larger percentage were males compared with the non-severe. Pooled analysis showed that prevalence of respiratory diseases (OR 4.21; 95% CI, 2.9–6.0) and smoking (current smoking OR 1.98; 95% CI, 1.16–3.39 and former smoking OR 3.46; 95% CI, 2.46–4.85) were significantly associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes. INTERPRETATION: Results suggested that underlying respiratory diseases, specifically COPD, and smoking were associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes. These findings may support the planning of preventive interventions and could contribute to improvements in the assessment and management of patient risk factors in clinical practice, leading to the mitigation of severe outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection.","Sanchez-Ramirez, Diana C.; Mackey, Denise",Respir Med,331,14

These complications are likely to have important short-term and long-term consequences for patients, health-care utilisation, health-care system preparedness, and society amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Our aim was to characterise the extent and effect of COVID-19 complications, particularly in those who survive, using the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK. METHODS: We did a prospective, multicentre cohort study in 302 UK health-care facilities. Adult patients aged 19 years or older, with confirmed or highly suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to COVID-19 were included in the study. The primary outcome of this study was the incidence of in-hospital complications, defined as organ-specific diagnoses occurring alone or in addition to any hallmarks of COVID-19 illness. We used multilevel logistic regression and survival models to explore associations between these outcomes and in-hospital complications, age, and pre-existing comorbidities. FINDINGS: Between Jan 17 and Aug 4, 2020, 80 388 patients were included in the study. Of the patients admitted to hospital for management of COVID-19, 49·7% (36 367 of 73 197) had at least one complication. The mean age of our cohort was 71·1 years (SD 18·7), with 56·0% (41 025 of 73 197) being male and 81·0% (59 289 of 73 197) having at least one comorbidity. Males and those aged older than 60 years were most likely to have a complication (aged ≥60 years: 54·5% [16 579 of 30 416] in males and 48·2% [11 707 of 24 288] in females; aged <60 years: 48·8% [5179 of 10 609] in males and 36·6% [2814 of 7689] in females). Renal (24·3%, 17 752 of 73 197), complex respiratory (18·4%, 13 486 of 73 197), and systemic (16·3%, 11 895 of 73 197) complications were the most frequent. Cardiovascular (12·3%, 8973 of 73 197), neurological (4·3%, 3115 of 73 197), and gastrointestinal or liver (0·8%, 7901 of 73 197) complications were also reported. INTERPRETATION: Complications and worse functional outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 are high, even in young, previously healthy individuals. Acute complications are associated with reduced ability to self-care at discharge, with neurological complications being associated with the worst functional outcomes.

IRES elements have been applied as useful tools for bi-cistronic expression vectors. Current RNA structure prediction programs are unable to predict precisely the potential IRES element. We have designed a viral IRES prediction system (VIPS) to perform the IRES secondary structure prediction. In order to obtain better results for the IRES prediction, the VIPS can evaluate and predict for all four different groups of IRESs with a higher accuracy. RNA secondary structure prediction, comparison, and pseudoknot prediction programs were implemented to form the three-stage procedure for the VIPS. The backbone of VIPS includes: the RNAL fold program, aimed to predict local RNA secondary structures by minimum free energy method; the RNA Align program, intended to compare predicted structures; and pknotsRG program, used to calculate the pseudoknot structure. VIPS was evaluated by using UTR database, IRES database and Virus database, and the accuracy rate of VIPS was assessed as 98.53%, 90.80%, 82.36% and 80.41% for IRES groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

Neurotoxicity testing of environmental chemicals mainly depends on the traditional animal models, which have various limitations such as species differences, expensive and time-consuming. Meanwhile, in vitro two-dimensional (2D) cultured cells or three-dimensional (3D) cultured neurospheres cannot fully simulate complex 3D structure of neural tissues. Recent advancements in neural organoid systems provides excellent models for the testing of environmental chemicals that affect the development of human CNS. Neural organoids derived from hPSCs not only can simulate the process of CNS development, including early stage neural tube formation, neuroepithelium differentiation and regional specification, but also its 3D structure, thus can be used to evaluate the effect of chemicals on differentiation and morphogenesis. Here, we provide a review of recent progress in the methods of culturing neural organoids and their applications in neurotoxicity testing of environmental chemicals.

To properly design such policy measures, it is important to quantify their effects in real-time. However, data on the relevant outcomes at the micro level is usually only available with considerable time lags. In this paper, we propose a novel method to assess the distributional consequences of macroeconomic shocks and policy responses in real-time and provide the first application to Germany in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, our approach combines different economic models estimated on firm- and household-level data: a VAR-model for output expectations, a structural labor demand model, and a tax-benefit microsimulation model. Our findings show that as of September 2020 the COVID-19 shock translates into a noticeable reduction in gross labor income across the entire income distribution. However, the tax benefit system and discretionary policy responses to the crisis act as important income stabilizers, since the effect on the distribution of disposable household incomes turns progressive: the bottom two deciles actually gain income, the middle deciles are hardly affected, and only the upper deciles lose income.

When the doors were closed, the air exchange rates in both stationary and moving trains increased with increasing area of window-opening (0.23–0.78 /h at 0 m(2), windows closed to 2.1–10 /h at 2.86 m(2), fully open). The air exchange rates were one order of magnitude higher when doors were open than when closed. With doors closed, the air exchange rates were higher when the centralized air conditioning (AC) and crossflow fan systems (fan) were on than when off. The air exchange rates in moving trains increased as train speed increased, from 10/h at 20 km/h to 42/h at 57 km/h. Air exchange rates did not differ significantly between empty cars and those filled with 230 mannequins representing commuters. The air exchange rates were lower during aboveground operation than during underground. Assuming that 30–300 passengers travel in a train car for 7–60 min and that the community infection rate is 0.0050%–0.30%, we estimated that commuters’ infection risk on trains was reduced by 91%–94% when all 12 windows were opened (to a height of 10 cm) and the AC/fan was on compared with that when windows were closed and the AC/fan was off.","Shinohara, Naohide; Sakaguchi, Jun; Kim, Hoon; Kagi, Naoki; Tatsu, Koichi; Mano, Hiroyuki; Iwasaki, Yuichi; Naito, Wataru",Environ Int,331,16

The present study proposes a model to explain the preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors among people with mental illness in Taiwan. Methods A cross-sectional design was carried and 414 patients with mental illness (230 males [55.6%]; mean age = 46.32 [SD = 10.86]) agreed to participate in the study. All the participants completed the Preventive COVID-19 Infection Behaviors Scale, Self-Stigma Scale-Short, Believing COVID-19 Information Scale, Fear of COVID-19 Scale, and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21. Regression models and structural equation modeling (SEM) were applied to examine the factors associated with preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors. Results Both regression models and SEM showed that trust in COVID-19 information sources (standardized coefficient [β] = 0.211 in regression; β = 0.194 in SEM) and fear of COVID-19 (β = -0.128 in regression; β = -0.223 in SEM) significantly explained preventive behaviors among individuals with mental illness. The SEM further showed that fear of COVID-19 was significantly explained by trust in COVID-19 information sources (β = 0.220) and self-stigma (β = 0.454). Conclusions Based on the results, healthcare providers should help individuals with mental illness reduce self-stigma and fear of COVID-19 which would consequently improve their preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors. Moreover, improving trust in COVID-19 information sources for individuals with mental illness may be another method to improve their preventive behaviors.","Chang, Kun-Chia; Strong, Carol; Pakpour, Amir H.; Griffiths, Mark D.; Lin, Chung-Ying",J Formos Med Assoc,331,28

This study compared the core clinical competencies of trainees who received PGY training at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital by attending the pilot training program in different groups. METHODS: We used six 10-min test stations for clinical performance evaluation, which comprised four and two test stations designed for objective structured clinical examination and procedural skill, respectively, to evaluate the learning outcomes of the trainees. The trainees were divided into three groups according to the training programs that they had attended. RESULTS: The aspects of clinical performance included history taking, physical examination, medical communication, logical thinking, and problem-solving abilities. The trainees who selected the surgery-based training program exhibited a higher performance at the station for aseptic surgical preparation than the other two groups (p = 0.0261). The trainees who selected the internal medical training program (p = 0.0020) exhibited a higher performance at the station for abdominal pain in children. CONCLUSIONS: A well-designed postgraduate training program should develop trainees' competencies, particularly clinical operational skills. The results of this study may provide useful insight into methods for improving the design of training programs.

Progresses in detection of early signs of brain injury and of CP allow early intervention (EI) programs for improving the outcome of these infants. CareToy system (CT), developed within a European project (Trial Registration: NCT01990183), allows providing, by means of tele-rehabilitation, a highly personalized, family-centered, home-based EI for young infants, remotely managed by clinicians. CareToy, already used with pre-terms without brain injury, has been adapted for high-risk infants in a project funded by the Italian Ministry of Health, and the CareToy-Revised (CareToy-R) has been realized (Trial registration: NCT03211533 and NCT03234959). Before assessing its efficacy, it was crucial to evaluate the acceptability, usability, and feasibility of CareToy-R EI. Nineteen high-risk infants with perinatal brain injury, aged 5.95 ± 2.13 months (range 3.12–10.78 months), carried out an 8-week training with CareToy-R at home, performing customized playful activities with their parents, tailored to their rehabilitative needs, remotely managed by clinicians. The feasibility of training and study procedures was assessed through criteria derived from literature; acceptability and usability have been analyzed from data about individual training and an ad hoc questionnaire. All CareToy-R trainings were planned by the clinical staff with a daily personalized use for each infant between 30 and 45 min (mean 34.37 min). The amount of executed training by the infants was very high (daily mean 30.30 min), with no differences related to infant age, sex, and gestational age. All the nine feasibility criteria were achieved, family compliance to the project was very good, data collection was completed and the CareToy-R system worked properly and easily for parents. The answers to the questionnaire had a total mean score of 84.49% and they ranged from a minimum of 81.05% (in “easy to use” area) to a maximum of 86.49% (“changes due to the training” area), with no differences related to nationality or familiarity with technology of the mothers. This study reports preliminary evidence to the feasibility of a home-based EI with CareToy-R system in infants at high risk for CP.

As body mass index (BMI) cannot reliably differentiate fat from lean mass, the metabolically detrimental abdominal obesity has been estimated using waist-hip ratio (WHR). Waist-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index (WHRadjBMI) in turn is a well-established sex-specific marker for abdominal fat and adiposity, and a predictor of adverse metabolic outcomes, such as T2D. However, the underlying genes and regulatory mechanisms orchestrating the sex differences in obesity and body fat distribution in humans are not well understood. METHODS: We searched for genetic master regulators of WHRadjBMI by employing integrative genomics approaches on human subcutaneous adipose RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data (n ~ 1400) and WHRadjBMI GWAS data (n ~ 700,000) from the WHRadjBMI GWAS cohorts and the UK Biobank (UKB), using co-expression network, transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS), and polygenic risk score (PRS) approaches. Finally, we functionally verified our genomic results using gene knockdown experiments in a human primary cell type that is critical for adipose tissue function. RESULTS: Here, we identified an adipose gene co-expression network that contains 35 obesity GWAS genes and explains a significant amount of polygenic risk for abdominal obesity and T2D in the UKB (n = 392,551) in a sex-dependent way. We showed that this network is preserved in the adipose tissue data from the Finnish Kuopio Obesity Study and Mexican Obesity Study. The network is controlled by a novel adipose master transcription factor (TF), TBX15, a WHRadjBMI GWAS gene that regulates the network in trans. Knockdown of TBX15 in human primary preadipocytes resulted in changes in expression of 130 network genes, including the key adipose TFs, PPARG and KLF15, which were significantly impacted (FDR < 0.05), thus functionally verifying the trans regulatory effect of TBX15 on the WHRadjBMI co-expression network. CONCLUSIONS: Our study discovers a novel key function for the TBX15 TF in trans regulating an adipose co-expression network of 347 adipose, mitochondrial, and metabolically important genes, including PPARG, KLF15, PPARA, ADIPOQ, and 35 obesity GWAS genes. Thus, based on our converging genomic, transcriptional, and functional evidence, we interpret the role of TBX15 to be a main transcriptional regulator in the adipose tissue and discover its importance in human abdominal obesity.

Currently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the infectious agent that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has spread from its epicenter in Wuhan China to all parts of the globe. Real-time mapping of new infections across the globe has revealed that variable transmission patterns and pathogenicity are associated with differences in SARS-CoV-2 lineages, clades, and strains. Thus, we reviewed how changes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and its structural architecture affect viral replication, immune evasion, and transmission within different human populations. We also looked at which immune dominant regions of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses are recognized by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)/Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) genes and how this could impact on subsequent disease pathogenesis.

Most traumatic brain injuries (TBI) have some degree of DAI, especially severe TBI. Computed tomography (CT) remains the first imaging test performed in the acute phase of TBI, but has low sensitivity for detecting DAI, since DAI is a cellular lesion. The aim of this study is to search in the literature for CT signs, in the first 24 h after TBI, that may help to differentiate patients in groups with a better versus worst prognosis. METHODS: We searched for primary scientific articles in the PubMed database, in English, indexed since January 1st, 2000. RESULTS: Five articles were selected for review. In the DAI group, traffic accidents accounted 70% of the cases, 79% were male, and the mean age was 41 years. There was an association between DAI and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (tSAH); an association between the IVH grade and number of corpus callosum lesions; and an association between blood in the interpeduncular cisterns (IPC) and brainstem lesions. CONCLUSION: In closed TBI with no tSAH, severe DAI is unlikely. Similarly, in the absence of IVH, any DAI is unlikely. If there is IVH, patients generally are clinically worse; and the more ventricles affected, the worse the prognosis.","Figueira Rodrigues Vieira, Giovana; Guedes Correa, José Fernando",Neuroradiology,331,11

Public emergency usually spreads via network. Due to the temporal and spatial flexibility and the information amplification of network, the opinions from different regions and background are easy to be represented as network public opinion, and have important impact on social and economic life. Thus, studying the formation mechanism of network public opinion has important theoretical and practical significance. Taking the formation process of network public opinion under emergencies as the research object, this paper first identifies the key factors influencing the formation of network public opinion, namely the internal characteristics (include individual education level, individual stubbornness, individual initial opinion, and so on) and external information of individuals (include external information intensity). Second, information intensity is introduced to describe the influence of external information feature on the formation of network public opinion. Individual education level, individual stubbornness, and individual initial opinion are analyzed to describe the influence of individual internal factors on the formation, and then its model is constructed. Through the simulation experiments, this paper analyzes the influence of external information intensity, individual education level, individual stubbornness, individual initial opinion, and other factors on the formation of network public opinion. The simulation results show that: (1) the greater intensity of public emergency reporting causes the easier formation of network public opinion; (2) the higher individual education level leads to the shorter time for completing the final formation and stable state of online public opinions, and after the formation of online public opinions, the opinion of the event is mainly neutral; (3) the greater individual's stubbornness makes the shorter formation time of online public opinion. When online public opinion reaches a stable state, the neutral opinion group dominates and firmly controls the development trend of public opinion; (4) the difference of opinions among individuals is the most important factor affecting the formation of network public opinion. Finally, the rationality and validity of the proposed model are verified by a real case. Compared with previous studies on the formation mechanism of network public opinion, this paper divides the formation process of network public opinion into three stages: individual information perception, individual decision making, and individual opinion transmission. Meanwhile, the influence of individual internal factors and external information characteristics on the formation process of network public opinion is also considered.","Chen, Tinggui; Peng, Lijuan; Yang, Jianjun; Cong, Guodong",Concurr Comput,331,30

As organisms age, the process of self-regulation or homeostasis begins to slow down with fewer stem cells available for tissue repair. Tissues become more fragile and organs less efficient. This slowdown of homeostatic processes leads to the development of cellular and neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we highlight the recent use and future potential of optogenetic approaches to study homeostasis. Optogenetics uses photosensitive molecules and genetic engineering to modulate cellular activity in vivo, allowing precise experiments with spatiotemporal control. We look at applications of this technology for understanding the mechanisms governing homeostasis and degeneration as applied to widely used model organisms, such as Drosophila melanogaster, where other common tools are less effective or unavailable.","Lim, Wen Kin; Kaur, Prameet; Huang, Huanyan; Jo, Richard Shim; Ramamoorthy, Anupriya; Ng, Li Fang; Suresh, Jahnavi; Maisha, Fahrisa Islam; Mathuru, Ajay S.; Tolwinski, Nicholas S.",Cell Mol Life Sci,331,20

The spatial organization of populations determines their pathogen dynamics. This is particularly important for communally roosting species, whose aggregations are often driven by the spatial structure of their environment. 2. We develop a spatially explicit model for virus transmission within roosts of Australian tree‐dwelling bats (Pteropus spp.), parameterized to reflect Hendra virus. The spatial structure of roosts mirrors three study sites, and viral transmission between groups of bats in trees was modelled as a function of distance between roost trees. Using three levels of tree density to reflect anthropogenic changes in bat habitats, we investigate the potential effects of recent ecological shifts in Australia on the dynamics of zoonotic viruses in reservoir hosts. 3. We show that simulated infection dynamics in spatially structured roosts differ from that of mean‐field models for equivalently sized populations, highlighting the importance of spatial structure in disease models of gregarious taxa. Under contrasting scenarios of flying‐fox roosting structures, sparse stand structures (with fewer trees but more bats per tree) generate higher probabilities of successful outbreaks, larger and faster epidemics, and shorter virus extinction times, compared to intermediate and dense stand structures with more trees but fewer bats per tree. These observations are consistent with the greater force of infection generated by structured populations with less numerous but larger infected groups, and may flag an increased risk of pathogen spillover from these increasingly abundant roost types. 4. Outputs from our models contribute insights into the spread of viruses in structured animal populations, like communally roosting species, as well as specific insights into Hendra virus infection dynamics and spillover risk in a situation of changing host ecology. These insights will be relevant for modelling other zoonotic viruses in wildlife reservoir hosts in response to habitat modification and changing populations, including coronaviruses like SARS‐CoV‐2.","Lunn, Tamika J.; Peel, Alison J.; McCallum, Hamish; Eby, Peggy; Kessler, Maureen K.; Plowright, Raina K.; Restif, Olivier",J Anim Ecol,331,26

Here, a dual priming oligonucleotide (DPO)-based multiplex real-time SYBR Green RT-PCR assay were developed for accurately differentiating PEDV, TGEV, PoRV, and PDCoV in clinical specimens targeting the N gene of TGEV, PEDV, and PDCoV, and the VP7 gene of PoRV. Results showed that the DPO primer allowed a wider annealing temperature range (40–65 °C) and had a higher priming specificity compared to conventional primer, in which more than 3 nucleotides in the 3′- or 5′-segment of DPO primer mismatched with DNA template, PCR amplification efficiency would decrease substantially or extension would not proceed. DPO-based multiplex real-time RT-PCR method had analytical detection limit of 8.63 × 10(2) copies/μL, 1.92 × 10(2) copies/μL, 1.74 × 10(2) copies/μL, and 1.76 × 10(2) copies/μL for PEDV, TGEV, PoRV, and PDCoV in clinical specimens, respectively. A total of 672 clinical specimens of piglets with diarrheal symptoms were collected in Northeastern China from 2017 to 2018 followed by analysis using the assay, and epidemiological investigation results showed that PEDV, TGEV, PoRV, and PDCoV prevalence was 19.05%, 5.21%, 4.32%, and 3.87%, respectively. The assay developed in this study showed higher detection accuracy than conventional RT-PCR method, suggesting a useful tool for the accurate differentiation of the four major viruses causing porcine viral diarrhea in practice.","Jia, Shuo; Feng, Baohua; Wang, Zhuo; Ma, Yingying; Gao, Xuwen; Jiang, Yanping; Cui, Wen; Qiao, Xinyuan; Tang, Lijie; Li, Yijing; Wang, Li; Xu, Yigang",Mol Cell Probes,331,1

We sought to capture and synthesize information about changes to routine immunization programs in response to the pandemic and plans to catch-up any missed immunizations. METHODS: Provincial/territorial (P/T) public health leaders were interviewed via teleconference between August-October 2020 to collect information on the following topics: how routine immunization delivery was affected during and after initial lockdown periods, plans to catch-up missed doses, and major challenges and achievements in continuing routine immunization programs. Data were coded and categorized according to common responses and descriptive analysis was performed. RESULTS: Interviews occurred with participants from 11 of 13 P/Ts. School immunization programs were reported to be most negatively affected by the pandemic (n = 9). In the early pandemic period, infant, preschool, and maternal/prenatal programs were prioritized, with most P/Ts continuing these services with adaptations for COVID-19. After the initial lockdown period, all routine programs were continuing with adaptations in most P/Ts. Infant, preschool, and school programs were most often targeted for catch-up through measures such as appointment rebooking and making additional clinics and/or providers available. Major challenges included resource limitations (e.g., staff shortages, PPE shortages, limited infrastructure) (n = 11), public health restrictions (n = 8), and public hesitancy to attend appointments (n = 5). CONCLUSIONS: Canadian routine immunization programs faced some disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the school, adult, and older adult programs. Further research is needed to determine the measurable impact of the pandemic on routine vaccine coverage levels.","Sell, Hannah; Assi, Ali; Driedger, S.

METHODS: A telemedicine workflow was implemented as a quality improvement study using the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) method. All patients presenting with ureteric colic without high-risk features of fever, severe pain, and hydronephrosis, were recruited, and face-to-face appointments to review scan results were replaced with phone consultations. Data was prospectively collected over three years (January 2017 to December 2019). Patient outcomes including the reduction in face-to-face review visits, time to review, reattendance and intervention rates, were tracked in an interrupted time-series analysis, and qualitative feedback was obtained from patients and clinicians. RESULTS: 53.2% of patients presenting with ureteric colic were recruited into the telemedicine workflow. 465 patients (46.2%) had normal scan results and 250 patients (24.9%) did not attend their scan appointments, hence reducing the number of face-to-face consultations by 71.1%. 230 patients (22.9%) required subsequent follow-up with urology, while 61 patients (6.1%) were referred to other specialties. Mean (SD) time to review was 30.0 (6.2) days, 6-month intervention rate was 3.4% (n=34) and unplanned reattendance rate was 3.2% (n=32). 93.1% of patients reported satisfaction with the service. CONCLUSION: The ureteric colic telemedicine service successfully and sustainably reduced the number of face-to-face consultations and time to review without compromising on patient safety. The availability of this telemedicine service has become even more important in helping us provide care to patients with ureteric colic in the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Ong, Chloe Shu Hui; Lu, Jirong; Tan, Yi Quan; Tan, Lincoln Guan Lim; Tiong, Ho Yee",Urology,331,20

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the reports relative to 9061 US-guided FNABs for the histologic definition of the nature of thyroid nodules: 45.4% completed with the cytopathologist assistance and 54.6% by the radiologist alone. We also performed the cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of the procedure with and without the cytopathologist assistance. RESULTS: We found a significant positive correlation between the adoption/non-adoption of cytopathologist assistance and the number of indeterminate (TIR1) (Chi-square; z-score, Z = 10.22; critical value 5%, C = 1.96; p < 0.001). The cytopathologist's absence was correlated with the number of TIR 1 (Pearson correlation, product–moment correlation r = 0.059; critical value 5%, C = 0.008; p < 0.001). The total cost of the model's cytopathologist-assistance branch is 109.87€, while the total cost of the non-cytopathologist-assistance branch is 95.08€. CONCLUSION: The cytopathologist assistance resulted in fewer nondiagnostic results, thus excluding the procedure's repetition but involved a higher expense, mainly due to the professional cost of the pathologist's participation. These data may provide decision-makers in healthcare with a practical evidence based on the opportunity to include the cytopathologist assistance in the thyroid nodule's FNAB depending on the available resources and the population's expectance.

Streptococcal infection in pediatric patients causing OCD (PANDAS) is another recent example of an infection-based psychiatric disorder. Inflammation associated with neuropsychiatric disorders has been previously reported but there is no standard clinical management approach established. Part of the reason is that it is unclear what factors determine the specific neuronal vulnerability and the efficacy of anti-inflammatory treatment in neuroinflammation. The emerging COVID-19 data suggested that in the acute stage, wide-spread neuronal damage appears to be the result of abnormal and overactive immune responses and cytokine storm is associated with poor prognosis. It is still too early to know if there are long term specific neuronal or brain regional damages associated with COVID-19, resulting in distinct neuropsychiatric disorders. In several major psychiatric disorders where neuroinflammation is present, patients with abnormal inflammatory markers may also experience less than favorable response or treatment resistance when standard treatment is used alone. Evidence regarding the benefits of co-administered anti-inflammatory agents such as COX-2 inhibitor is encouraging in selected patients though may not benefit others. Disease modifying therapies are increasingly being applied to neuropsychiatric diseases characterized by abnormal or hyperreactive immune responses. Adjunct anti-inflammatory treatment may benefit selected patients and is definitely an important component of clinical management in the presence of neuroinflammation.","Tang, Siu Wa; Helmeste, Daiga; Leonard, Brian",Acta neuropsychiatrica,331,20

Based on this heterogeneous community network, we propose a novel mathematical epidemic model for each community and study the epidemic dynamics in this network model. We find that the location of the initial infection node only affects the spreading velocity and barely influences the epidemic prevalence. And the epidemic threshold of entire network decreases with the increase of heterogeneity among communities. Moreover, the epidemic prevalence increases with the increase of heterogeneity around the epidemic threshold, while the converse situation holds when the infection rate is much greater than the epidemic threshold.","Li, Chanchan; Jiang, Guo-ping; Song, Yurong; Xia, Lingling; Li, Yinwei; Song, Bo",J Parallel Distrib Comput,331,26

In this study, we aimed to assess the incidence and impact of COVID-19 on in-hospital clinical outcome of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients managed with PPCI. This observational retrospective study was conducted on consecutive STEMI patients who presented to the International Cardiac Center (ICC) hospital, Alexandria, Egypt between 1 February and 31 October 2020. A group of STEMI patients presented during the same period in 2019 was also assessed (control group) and data was used for comparison. The inclusion criteria were established diagnosis of STEMI requiring PPCI.A total of 634 patients were included in the study. During the COVID-19 period, the number of PPCI procedures was reduced by 25.7% compared with previous year (mean 30.0 ± 4.01 vs. 40.4 ± 5.3 case/month) and the time from first medical contact to Needle (FMC-to-N) was longer (125.0 ± 53.6 vs. 52.6 ± 22.8 min, p = 0.001). Also, during COVID-19, the in-hospital mortality was higher (7.4 vs. 4.6%, p = 0.036) as was the incidence of re-infarction (12.2 vs. 7.7%, p = 0.041) and the need for revascularization (15.9 vs. 10.7%, p = 0.046). The incidence of heart failure, stroke, and bleeding was not different between groups, but hospital stay was longer during COVID-19 (6.85 ± 4.22 vs. 3.5 ± 2.3 day, p = 0.0025). Conclusion: At the ICC, COVID-19 pandemic contributed significantly to the PPCI management of STEMI patients with decreased number and delayed procedures. COVID-19 was also associated with higher in-hospital mortality, rate of re-infarction, need for revascularization, and longer hospital stay.","Ayad, Sherif; Shenouda, Rafik; Henein, Michael",J Clin Med,331,21

It shares approximately 94% identity of nucleotide sequence with two recently reported North American strains, 16244B and VR2332, but only 78% with a European strain, Lelystad virus (LV). Its genome is the longest among the four published complete sequences of PRRSV, due to an insertion in the Nsp2-encoding region. Compared to Nsp2 of the North American strains and the European strain, the predicted Nsp2 of strain SP contains 36 and 155 amino acid insertions, respectively, near the C-terminus, in addition to several highly variable regions. The insertion shows no homology with any equivalent arterivirus proteins. This high sequence disparity of Nsp2 among different PRRSV isolates suggested that it could be used as a marker to differentiate PRRSV genotypes. The 5′ RACE and primer extension analysis of three North American strains demonstrated that the utmost 5′-end nucleotides are conserved among PRRSV strains isolated from two continents. The predicted polyprotein 1a/b contains conserved proteinase, polymerase and helicase domains responsible for polyprotein processing, RNA transcription and replication.","Shen, S.; Kwang, J.; Liu, W.; Liu, D.

This study sought to assess the validity and reliability of a pilot version of the tool in an urban emergency department (ED) in Papua New Guinea. METHODS: A pragmatic observational study was conducted at Gerehu General Hospital in Port Moresby, commencing eight weeks after IITT implementation. All ED patients presenting within the subsequent two-month period were included. Triage assessments were performed by a variety of ED clinicians, including community health workers, nurses and doctors. The primary outcome was sensitivity for the detection of time-critical illness, defined by ten pre-specified diagnoses. The association between triage category and ED outcomes was examined using Cramer's V correlation coefficient. Reliability was assessed by inter-rater agreement between a local and an experienced, external triage officer. FINDINGS: Among 4512 presentations during the study period, 58 (1.3%) were classified as category one (emergency), 967 (21.6%) as category two (priority) and 3478 (77.1%) as category three (non-urgent). The tool's sensitivity for detecting the pre-specified set of time-sensitive conditions was 70.8% (95%CI 58.2-81.4%), with negative predictive values of 97.3% (95%CI 96.7 - 97.8%) for admission/transfer and 99.9% (95%CI 99.7 - 100.0%) for death. The admission/transfer rate was 44.8% (26/58) among emergency patients, 22.9% (223/976) among priority patients and 2.7% (94/3478) among non-urgent patients (Cramer's V=0.351, p=0.00). Four of 58 (6.9%) emergency patients, 19/976 (2.0%) priority patients and 3/3478 (0.1%) non-urgent patients died in the ED (Cramer's V=0.14, p=0.00). The under-triage rate was 2.7% (94/3477) and the over-triage rate 48.2% (28/58), both within pre-specified limits of acceptability. On average, it took staff 3 minutes 34 seconds (SD 1:06) to determine and document a triage category. Among 70 observed assessments, weighted κ was 0.84 (excellent agreement). INTERPRETATION: The pilot version of the IITT demonstrated acceptable performance characteristics, and validation in other EC settings is warranted.

Social media platforms such as Twitter have been a critical tool in this process, providing a communication channel that allows both rapid dissemination of messages to the public at large and individual-level engagement. Message dissemination and amplification is a necessary precursor to reaching audiences, both online and off, as well as inspiring action. Therefore, it is valuable for organizational risk communication to identify strategies and practices that may lead to increased message passing among online users. In this research, we examine message features shown in prior disasters to increase or decrease message retransmission under imminent threat conditions to develop models of official risk communicators’ messages shared online from February 1, 2020-April 30, 2020. We develop a lexicon of keywords associated with risk communication about the pandemic response, then use automated coding to identify message content and message structural features. We conduct chi-square analyses and negative binomial regression modeling to identify the strategies used by official risk communicators that respectively increase and decrease message retransmission. Findings show systematic changes in message strategies over time and identify key features that affect message passing, both positively and negatively. These results have the potential to aid in message design strategies as the pandemic continues, or in similar future events.","Sutton, Jeannette; Renshaw, Scott L.; Butts, Carter T.",PLoS One,331,20

The incorporation of novel enzymatic pathways, resulting peptides, and their corresponding receptors into the biochemical cascade of the RAS provides a better understanding of its role in the regulation of cardiovascular and renal function. Hence, in recent years, it became apparent that the balance between the two opposing effector peptides, angiotensin II and angiotensin-(1-7), may have a pivotal role in determining different cardiovascular pathophysiologies. Furthermore, our recent studies provide evidence for the functional relevance of a newly discovered rat peptide, containing two additional amino acid residues compared to angiotensin I, first defined as proangiotensin-12 [angiotensin-(1-12)]. This review focuses on angiotensin-(1-7) and its important contribution to cardiovascular function and growth, while introducing angiotensin-(1-12) as a potential novel angiotensin precursor.","Varagic, Jasmina; Trask, Aaron J.; Jessup, Jewell A.; Chappell, Mark C.; Ferrario, Carlos M.",J Mol Med (Berl),331,24

The experiment was repeated. Diarrhoea and shedding of oocysts were seen in all animals infected with the CPB-0 isolate. Clinical signs included depression, inappetence, vomiting (exclusively in the piglets), and death. Histological examination at 17 and 19 days post-infection revealed parasitic stages and microscopic changes primarily restricted to colon and rectum. The unintended presence of rotavirus in some of the experimental animals revealed an additive or synergistic effect between rotavirus and C. parvum as indicated by prolonged diarrhoea, increased oocyst shedding, decreased weight gain and elevated levels of serum haptoglobin and serum amyloid A (SAA) in piglets infected simultaneously with both pathogens. The difference in daily weight gain between infected and control animals was significant only for piglets co-infected with rotavirus. The acute phase response of haptoglobin and SAA was characterised by a large individual variation. In piglets, co-infected with rotavirus, the levels of serum haptoglobin were 3.5 and 4.6 times higher in the infected versus the controls 6 and 9 dpi, respectively (mean values: 2411 μg/ml±S.D. 2023 and 1840 μg/ml±S.D. 1697). In the controls infected with rotavirus, peak haptoglobin concentration was seen 3 dpi (mean: 1022 μg/ml±S.D. 425). Elevated levels of SAA were seen in 1 of 6 piglets infected with C. parvum, and in 5 of 6 piglets co-infected with rotavirus. Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) was undetectable in all serum samples from piglets. The obvious advantages of the SPF pig model are the naturally acquired intestinal microflora, the development of distinct clinical signs similar to cryptosporidiosis in humans and calves, the size of the animals, and the accessibility of individuals born within a short time span. This makes the model ideal for dose–response studies, evaluation of therapeutic agents as well as for assessment of differences in the clinical response to isolates of diverse genetic background. In conclusion, it was shown that the CPB-0 isolate was pathogenic to calves and piglets at a dose of 2.5×10(5) oocysts, and that the clinical signs could be replicated during separate experiments. Moreover, diarrhoea, oocyst shedding, body weight changes, histological alterations, and the acute phase response of haptoglobin and SAA were identified as useful parameters for discrimination of isolate-specific differences of pathogenicity.","Enemark, H.L; Bille-Hansen, V; Lind, P; Heegaard, P.M.H; Vigre, H; Ahrens, P; Thamsborg, S.M",Vet Parasitol,331,12

Respiratory tract infections are caused by many different bacteria (including mycobacteria) and viruses, and rapid detection of pathogens in individual cases is crucial in achieving the best clinical management, public health surveillance, and control outcomes. Further challenges in improving management outcomes for respiratory tract infections exist: rapid identification of drug resistant pathogens; more widespread surveillance of infections, locally and internationally; and global responses to infections with pandemic potential. Developments in genome amplification have led to the discovery of several new respiratory pathogens, and sensitive PCR methods for the diagnostic work-up of these are available. Advances in technology have allowed for development of single and multiplexed PCR techniques that provide rapid detection of respiratory viruses in clinical specimens.

Methods: A questionnaire was sent to the BACFS multidisciplinary team (n = 13) asking for success scores (0–10) for 11 key areas and comments on challenges, lessons learnt and future development. Results: BACFS has successfully adopted EMIS and is now the principal recording system for CF clinical data, without which BACFS could not have worked remotely during COVID-19. The main challenges identified by users were IT authorisation/ Governance delays, lack of suitable IT, staff knowledge and use during inpatient episodes. Key lessons learned were it needs a designated project manager, a team ready for change, appropriate technology and a deadline. Recurrent user development suggestions included improvements to templates and inpatient processes. Conclusion: It has been a varied team experience yet hugely positive from a service perspective;EMIS has been pivotal for BACFS to function safely and effectively during COVID-19. None of the challenges were insurmountable with correct stakeholder engagement, investment in IT kit, peer support and, most importantly, an implementation lead.

Reductions in exercise duration was a significant risk factor for mild stress and moderate‐to‐severe depression while increase in exercise frequency was found to be a protective factor against depressed mood. Our study revealed that a short‐term reduction in physical activity levels during lockdown was associated with poorer psychological outcomes. Given the protection that exercise confers on depression, physical activity should be promoted at the workplace and at home to support healthcare workers to cope through this protracted health crisis.","Kua, Zaylea; Hamzah, Fadzil; Tan, Pei T.; Ong, Li J.; Tan, Benedict; Huang, Zhongwei",Stress Health,331,24

METHODS: This position paper reviews the scientific literature, the current regulatory framework adopted for MD to date, and the likely impact, including some costs data in case of the absence of such labelling. RESULTS: Efforts made by several scientific teams, who are trying to identify the culprit of such adverse effects, either via asking for cooperation from companies, or using costly chemical analyses of MD, can only partly, and with considerable delay, compensate for the absence of meaningful information on the composition of MD; hence, patient management is compromised. Indeed, without knowing the chemical substances present, physicians are unable to inform patients about which substances they should avoid, and which alternative MD may be suitable/tolerated.

We developed an app to support asthma self-management among people with limited health literacy in a web-based workshop (to ensure physical distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop and test a prototype asthma self-management mobile app tailored to the needs of people with limited health literacy through a web-based workshop. METHODS: We recruited participants from a primary care center in Malaysia. We adapted a design sprint methodology to a web-based workshop in five stages over 1 week. Patients with asthma and limited health literacy provided insights into real-life self-management issues in stage 1, which informed mobile app development in stages 2-4. We recruited additional patients to test the prototype in stage 5 using a qualitative research design. Participants gave feedback through a concurrent thinking-aloud process moderated by a researcher. Each interview lasted approximately 1 hour. Screen recordings of app browsing activities were performed. Interviews were audio-recorded and analyzed using a thematic approach to identify utility and usability issues. RESULTS: The stakeholder discussion identified four themes: individual, family, friends, and society and system levels. Five patients tested the prototype. Participants described 4 ways in which the app influenced or supported self-management (utility): offering information, providing access to an asthma action plan, motivating control of asthma through support for medication adherence, and supporting behavior change through a reward system. Specific usability issues addressed navigation, comprehension, and layout. CONCLUSIONS: This study proved that it was possible to adapt the design sprint workshop to a web-based format with the added advantage that it allowed the development and the testing process to be done efficiently through various programs. The resultant app incorporated advice from stakeholders, including sources for information about asthma, medication and appointment reminders, accessible asthma action plans, and sources for social support. The app is now ready to move to feasibility testing.","Salim, Hani; Lee, Ping Yein; Sharif-Ghazali, Sazlina; Cheong, Ai Theng; Wong, Jasmine; Young, Ingrid; Pinnock, Hilary",J Med Internet Res,331,28

Here, we compare the clinical and molecular features of patients with long duration of viral shedding (LDs) with those from patients with short duration patients (SDs), and healthy donors (HDs). We find that several cytokines and chemokines, such as interleukin (IL)-2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and lymphotoxin α (LT-α) are present at lower levels in LDs than SDs. Single-cell RNA sequencing shows that natural killer (NK) cells and CD14(+) monocytes are reduced, while regulatory T cells are increased in LDs; moreover, T and NK cells in LDs are less activated than in SDs. Importantly, most cells in LDs show reduced expression of ribosomal protein (RP) genes and related pathways, with this inversed correlation between RP levels and infection duration further validated in 103 independent patients. Our results thus indicate that immunosuppression and low RP expression may be related to the persistence of the viral infection in COVID-19 patients.","Yang, Bin; Fan, Junpeng; Huang, Jia; Guo, Ensong; Fu, Yu; Liu, Si; Xiao, Rourou; Liu, Chen; Lu, Funian; Qin, Tianyu; He, Chao; Wang, Zizhuo; Qin, Xu; Hu, Dianxing; You, Lixin; Li, Xi; Wang, Tian; Wu, Peng; Chen, Gang; Zhou, Jianfeng; Li, Kezhen; Sun, Chaoyang",Nat Commun,331,21

With more than thirteen million infected and nearly 600000 fatalities in 188 countries/regions, COVID-19 is the worst calamity since the World War II. These misfortunes are traced to various reasons, including late detection of latent or asymptomatic carriers, migration, and inadequate isolation of infected people. This makes detection, containment, and mitigation global priorities to contain exposure via quarantine, lockdowns, work/stay at home, and social distancing that are focused on “flattening the curve”. While medical and healthcare givers are at the frontline in the battle against COVID-19, it is a crusade for all of humanity. Meanwhile, machine and deep learning models have been revolutionary across numerous domains and applications whose potency have been exploited to birth numerous state-of-the-art technologies utilised in disease detection, diagnoses, and treatment. Despite these potentials, machine and, particularly, deep learning models are data sensitive, because their effectiveness depends on availability and reliability of data. The unavailability of such data hinders efforts of engineers and computer scientists to fully contribute to the ongoing assault against COVID-19. Faced with a calamity on one side and absence of reliable data on the other, this study presents two data-augmentation models to enhance learnability of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM)-based deep learning models (DADLMs) and, by doing so, boost the accuracy of COVID-19 detection. Experimental results reveal improvement in terms of accuracy of detection, logarithmic loss, and testing time relative to DLMs devoid of such data augmentation. Furthermore, average increases of 4% to 11% in COVID-19 detection accuracy are reported in favour of the proposed data-augmented deep learning models relative to the machine learning techniques. Therefore, the proposed algorithm is effective in performing a rapid and consistent Corona virus diagnosis that is primarily aimed at assisting clinicians in making accurate identification of the virus.","Sedik, Ahmed; Iliyasu, Abdullah M; Abd El-Rahiem, Basma; Abdel Samea, Mohammed E.; Abdel-Raheem, Asmaa; Hammad, Mohamed; Peng, Jialiang; Abd El-Samie, Fathi E.; Abd El-Latif, Ahmed A.",Viruses,331,16

Detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) are believed to have a predictive value for immune protection against COVID-19 and is currently a surrogate indicator for vaccine efficacy. OBJECTIVE: : To determine IgG Abs in anti-CD20 treated patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). METHOD: : IgG Abs against SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor–binding domain were measured with the SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant assay (Abbott Laboratories) before and after vaccination (n=60). RESULTS: : 36.7% of patients mounted a positive SARS-CoV-2 spike Ab response after the second dose of vaccine. Five patients (8.3%) developed Abs >264 BAU/mL, another 12 patients (20%) developed intermediate Abs between 54 BAU/mL and 264 BAU/mL and five patients (8.3%) had low levels <54 BAU/mL. Of all seropositive patients, 63.6% converted from seronegative to seropositive after the 2(nd) vaccine. CONCLUSION: : Our study demonstrates decreased humoral response after BNT162b2 mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in MS patients receiving B-cell depleting therapy. Clinicians should advise patients treated with anti-CD20 to avoid exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Future studies should investigate the implications of a third booster vaccine in patients with low or absent Abs after vaccination.","Novak, Frederik; Nilsson, Anna Christine; Nielsen, Christian; Holm, Dorte K.; Østergaard, Kamilla; Bystrup, Anna; Byg, Keld-Erik; Johansen, Isik S.; Mittl, Kristen; Rowles, William; Mcpolin, Kira; Spencer, Collin; Sagan, Sharon; Gerungan, Chloe; Wilson, Michael R.; Zamvil, Scott S.; Bove, Riley; Sabatino, Joseph J.; Sejbaek, Tobias",Mult Scler Relat Disord,331,16

These enzymes have recently been shown to cleave 5-N-acetyl-9-O-acetyl neuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac(2)) to yield de-O-acetylated Neu5Ac, the latter of which may serve as a carbon and/or nitrogen source. In the current study, we investigated the NanS- and NanS-p-mediated digestion of synthetic O-acetylated neuraminic acids and bovine submaxillary glands mucin (BSM)-derived O-acetylneuraminic acids by high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) and nano electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (nanoESI MS). Initial HPTLC analyses showed the expected activity of NanS and NanS-p variants for Neu5,9Ac(2). However, all tested enzymes were unable to de-O-acetylate 5-N-acetyl-4-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,4 Ac(2)) in our test system. The nanoESI MS analysis of neuraminic acids after treatment of BSM with NanS-p gave evidence that NanS-p variants of EHEC O157:H7 strain EDL933 cleave off O-acetyl groups from mono-, di-, and tri-O-acetylated Neu5Ac and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), regardless of the carbon positions C7, C8 or C9 of the acetate esters. This enzyme activity leads to neuraminidase-accessible Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc on mucin glycans. Moreover, we could demonstrate by HPTLC analyses that recombinant Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron sialidase (BTSA-His) was able to cleave Neu5Ac and Neu5,9Ac(2) from BSM and that the combination of BTSA-His with both NanS-His and NanS-p-His derivatives enhanced the release of de-O-acetylated core Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc from mammalian mucin O-glycans. Growth experiments with EHEC wildtype strain EDL933, its nanS and nanS/nanS-p1a-p7 mutant and exogenous BTSA-His in BSM demonstrated that the presence of BTSA-His enhanced growth of EDL933 and the nanS deletion mutant but not the nanS/nanS-p1a-p7 mutant. Thus, we hypothesize that the expression of sialic acid O-acetylesterases with a broad specificity could be an advantage in competition with the gut microbiota for nutrients and facilitate EHEC colonization in the human large intestine.","Feuerbaum, S.; Saile, N.; Pohlentz, G.; Müthing, J.; Schmidt, H.",Int J Med Microbiol,331,1

Healthcare systems worldwide are under great pressure, and there is urgent need for effective antiviral treatments. The only currently approved antiviral treatment for COVID-19 is remdesivir, an inhibitor of viral genome replication. SARS-CoV-2 proliferation relies on the enzymatic activities of the non-structural proteins (nsp), which makes them interesting targets for the development of new antiviral treatments. With the aim to identify novel SARS-CoV-2 antivirals, we have purified the exoribonuclease/methyltransferase (nsp14) and its cofactor (nsp10) and developed biochemical assays compatible with high-throughput approaches to screen for exoribonuclease inhibitors. We have screened a library of over 5000 commercial compounds and identified patulin and aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) as inhibitors of nsp14 exoribonuclease in vitro. We found that patulin and ATA inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 in a VERO E6 cell-culture model.

Due to the potential genetic diversity of some viruses, such as HIV-1 and influenza, standard neutralizing antibodies are often ineffective or easily evaded as their targets are masked or rapidly mutated. This has thwarted efforts to both prevent and treat HIV-1 infections and means that entirely new formulations are required to vaccinate against influenza each year. However, some rare antibodies isolated from infected individuals confer broad and potent neutralization. A subset of these broadly neutralizing antibodies possesses a long complementarity-determining 3 region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (CDR H3). This feature generates unique antigen binding site configurations that can engage conserved but otherwise inaccessible epitope targets thus neutralizing many viral variants. Remarkably, ultralong CDR H3s are a common feature of the cow antibody repertoire and are encoded by a single variable, diversity, joining (VDJ) recombination that is extensively diversified prior to antigen exposure. Recently, it was shown that cows rapidly generate a broadly neutralizing response upon exposure to HIV-1 and this is primarily mediated by these novel ultralong antibody types. This review summarises the current knowledge of these unusual CDR H3 structures and discusses their known and potential future uses.","Burke, Matthew J.; Stockley, Peter G.; Boyes, Joan",Viruses,331,14

Approximately 5–10% of the cases of these diseases are determined by amyloidogenic mutations, as well as by transmission of infectious amyloids (prions) between organisms. The most common group of so-called sporadic amyloidoses is associated with abnormal aggregation of wild-type proteins. Some sporadic amyloidoses are known to be induced only against the background of certain pathologies, but in some cases the cause of amyloidosis is unclear. It is assumed that these diseases often occur by accident. Here we present facts and hypotheses about the association of sporadic amyloidoses with vascular pathologies, trauma, oxidative stress, cancer, metabolic diseases, chronic infections and COVID-19. Generalization of current data shows that all sporadic amyloidoses can be regarded as a secondary event occurring against the background of diseases provoking a cellular stress response. Various factors causing the stress response provoke protein overproduction, a local increase in the concentration or modifications, which contributes to amyloidogenesis. Progress in the treatment of vascular, metabolic and infectious diseases, as well as cancers, should lead to a significant reduction in the risk of sporadic amyloidoses.","Galkin, Alexey P.; Sysoev, Evgeniy I.",Int J Mol Sci,331,16

Although evidence of the prevalence of PDCoV in China is accumulating, little published information about Chinese PDCoV isolates is available. In this study, we investigated the presence of PDCoV in 49 faecal/intestinal samples from piglets with diarrhoea on different farms in Hebei province. Five samples (10.2%) were positive for PDCoV, but no coinfection of PDCoV with other enteropathogens was observed. A PDCoV strain named HB‐BD was successfully isolated from the intestinal contents of a diarrhoeic piglet and serially propagated in swine testicular (ST) cells for >40 passages. The complete genome of the HB‐BD strain was sequenced and analysed. Genomic analysis showed that the HB‐BD strain had a closer relationship with Chinese strains than those from other countries and was grouped within the Chinese PDCoV cluster. The results of this study will be valuable for further research of PDCoV genetic evolution and development of effective diagnostic reagents, assays and potential vaccines against newly emerged PDCoV strains.","Liu, B.‐J.; Zuo, Y.‐Z.; Gu, W.‐Y.; Luo, S.‐X.; Shi, Q.‐K.; Hou, L.‐S.; Zhong, F.; Fan, J.‐H.",Transbound Emerg Dis,331,16

However, the information available is not always suitable for all readers due to its difficult readability. We sought to assess the readability of online information regarding the novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and establish whether they follow the patient educational information reading level recommendations. Study design This is a cross-sectional study. Methods We searched five key terms on Google and the first 30 results from each of the searches were considered for analysis. Five validated readability tests were utilized in order to establish the reading level for each article. Results Out of the 150 gathered articles, 61 met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated. None (0%) of the articles met the recommended 5th to 6th grade reading level (of a 11-12-year-old). The mean readability scores were: Flesch Reading Ease 44.14, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level 12.04, Gunning-Fog Index 14.27, Simple Measure of Gobbledygook SMOG Index 10.71, and Coleman-Liau Index 12.69.

In Japan, seasonal influenza affects more than 10 million people per year, and especially children, the elderly, and patients with underlying medical conditions, and seasonal influenza can cause severe illness. As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread, the combined risk of concurrent influenza epidemics and the COVID-19 pandemic are a concern. When the status of influenza virus infections during the 2020-2021 flu season was compared to the 2011 to 2020 flu seasons, data indicated the absence of seasonal influenza outbreaks in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of flu patients was roughly estimated to be 14,000 nationwide from September 2020 to March 2021, which marks the first sharp decrease since national influenza surveillance started in 1987 in conjunction with National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Diseases (NESID). Moreover, approximately 500 sentinel sites (designated medical facilities) nationwide reported only 112 patients with severe influenza who required hospitalization. Since prevention and control measures amidst the COVID-19 pandemic have become the ""new normal"", one can reasonably assume that the absence of a seasonal influenza outbreak is related to prevention and control measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Basic infection prevention measures were thoroughly implemented, such as wearing masks, handwashing, and avoiding confined spaces, crowded places, and close-contact settings. More importantly, the behavioral changes adopted to constrain COVID-19 during three declared states of emergency reduced population density and contact with people, including closing schools, asking restaurants to reduce their business hours, teleworking, curbing the flow of people during vacation week, etc. These behavioral changes will serve as a valuable reference to reduce the spread of seasonal influenza in the future.","Sawakami, Tatsuo; Karako, Kenji; Song, Peipei",Global health & medicine,331,1

We have developed artificial intelligence (AI)-inspired methods for modeling the transmission dynamics of the epidemics and evaluating interventions to curb the spread and impact of COVID-19. The developed methods were applied to the surveillance data of cumulative and new COVID-19 cases and deaths reported by WHO as of March 16th, 2020. Both the timing and the degree of intervention were evaluated. The average error of five-step ahead forecasting was 2.5%. The total peak number of cumulative cases, new cases, and the maximum number of cumulative cases in the world with complete intervention implemented 4 weeks later than the beginning date (March 16th, 2020) reached 75,249,909, 10,086,085, and 255,392,154, respectively. However, the total peak number of cumulative cases, new cases, and the maximum number of cumulative cases in the world with complete intervention after 1 week were reduced to 951,799, 108,853 and 1,530,276, respectively. Duration time of the COVID-19 spread was reduced from 356 days to 232 days between later and earlier interventions. We observed that delaying intervention for 1 month caused the maximum number of cumulative cases reduce by −166.89 times that of earlier complete intervention, and the number of deaths increased from 53,560 to 8,938,725.

Rapid detection could facilitate control, however widespread point-of-care testing is infrequently done due to the lack of robust and portable methods. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is a novel isothermal method which rapidly amplifies and detects nucleic acids using a simple device in near real-time. An RT-RPA assay targeting a recent epidemic human norovirus strain (GII.4 New Orleans) was developed and evaluated in this study. The assay successfully detected purified norovirus RNA from multiple patient outbreak isolates and had a limit of detection of 3.40 ± 0.20 log(10) genomic copies (LGC), which is comparable to most other reported isothermal norovirus amplification methods. The assay also detected norovirus in directly boiled stool, and displayed better resistance to inhibitors than a commonly used RT-qPCR assay. The assay was specific, as it did not amplify genomes from 9 non-related enteric viruses and bacteria. The assay detected norovirus in some samples in as little as 6 min, and the entire detection process can be performed in less than 30 min. The reported RT-RPA method shows promise for sensitive point-of-care detection of epidemic human norovirus, and is the fastest human norovirus amplification method to date.","Moore, Matthew D.; Jaykus, Lee-Ann",Sci Rep,331,16

We modified the EMU admission protocol via anti-seizure medications (ASM) withdrawal implemented one day before admission; thus, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this modified protocol. METHODS: In January 2021, we initiated ASM tapering 24 hours before—rather than on the first day after—EMU admission, contrasting with the previous protocol. We retrospectively reviewed EMU admissions between January and April of 2018, 2019, and 2021, and identified the time required to record the first seizure, and EMU yield to confirm or change the epilepsy classification. We also evaluated the safety of the modified protocol, by monitoring the seizure frequency for up to 5 months after the discharge from the hospital. RESULTS: One hundred four patients were included (mean age: 30 years, men: 43%); excluding a longer disease duration and abundance of normal routine electro-encephalogram (EEG) in patients admitted before the pandemic, no differences were observed in patients' characteristics. On average, it took 41 hours and 21 hours to record the first seizure using the standard and modified protocols, respectively (p<0.001, 95% CI: 10–30). Other characteristics were investigated both before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, and epilepsy classifications were confirmed twice using the modified protocol (OR=2.4, p=0.04, 95% CI: 1.1–5.5). Multivariate regression analysis confirmed the shorter time to record the first seizure using the modified admission protocol (23 hours less, p<0.001; 95% CI: 12–34). Finally, 36 (86 %) patients admitted during the pandemic exhibited no increase in seizure frequency after the discharge from the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Initiating ASM withdrawal one day before EMU admission was deemed to be an efficient and safe way to confirm epilepsy classification and significantly decrease the length of hospital stay. Ultimately, this will shorten the long waiting list for EMU admission created by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Babtain, Fawzi; Atteyah, Daniah; Milyani, Haneen; Banjer, Tasnim; Alqadi, Khalid; Baeesa, Saleh; Al Said, Youssef",Epilepsy Behav,331,27

The benefits of in-person learning are numerous, in terms of education quality, mental health, emotional well-being, equity and access to food and shelter. Early reports suggested that children might have reduced susceptibility to COVID-19, and children have been shown to experience fewer complications than older adults. Over the past few months, our understanding of COVID-19 has been further shaped by emerging data, and it is now understood that children are as susceptible to infection as adults and have a similar viral load during infection, even if asymptomatic. Based on this updated understanding of the disease, we have used epidemiological modeling to explore the feasibility and consequences of school reopening in the face of differing rates of COVID-19 prevalence and transmission. We focused our analysis on the United States, but the results are applicable to other countries as well. We demonstrate the potential for a large discrepancy between detected cases and true infections in schools due to the combination of high asymptomatic rates in children coupled with delays in seeking testing and receiving results from diagnostic tests. Our findings indicate that, regardless of the initial prevalence of the disease, and in the absence of robust surveillance testing and contact-tracing, most schools in the United States can expect to remain open for 20–60 days without the emergence of sizeable disease clusters. At this point, even if schools choose to close after outbreaks occur, COVID-19 cases will be seeded from these school clusters and amplified into the community. Thus, our findings suggest that the debate between the risks to student safety and benefits of in-person learning frames a false dual choice. Reopening schools without surveillance testing and contact tracing measures in place will lead to spread within the schools and within the communities that eventually forces a return to remote learning and leaves a trail of infection in its wake.","Johnson, Kaitlyn E.; Stoddard, Madison; Nolan, Ryan P.; White, Douglas E.; Hochberg, Natasha S.; Chakravarty, Arijit",PLoS One,331,1

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of identified SARS-CoV-2 variants, virus clades, and clade groups with disease severity and patient outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cross-sectional study, viral genome analysis of clinical specimens obtained from patients at the Cleveland Clinic infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the initial wave of infection (March 11 to April 22, 2020) was performed. Identified variants were matched with clinical outcomes. Data analysis was performed from April to July 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mortality, and laboratory outcomes were matched with SARS-CoV-2 variants. RESULTS: Specimens sent for viral genome sequencing originated from 302 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (median [interquartile range] age, 52.6 [22.8 to 82.5] years), of whom 126 (41.7%) were male, 195 (64.6%) were White, 91 (30.1%) required hospitalization, 35 (11.6%) needed ICU admission, and 17 (5.6%) died. From these specimens, 2531 variants (484 of which were unique) were identified. Six different SARS-CoV-2 clades initially circulated followed by a rapid reduction in clade diversity. Several variants were associated with lower hospitalization rate, and those containing 23403A>G (D614G Spike) were associated with increased survival when the patient was hospitalized (64 of 74 patients [86.5%] vs 10 of 17 patients [58.8%]; χ(2)(1) = 6.907; P = .009). Hospitalization and ICU admission were similar regardless of clade. Infection with Clade V variants demonstrated higher creatinine levels (median [interquartile range], 2.6 [−0.4 to 5.5] mg/dL vs 1.0 [0.2 to 2.2] mg/dL; mean creatinine difference, 2.9 mg/dL [95% CI, 0.8 to 5.0 mg/dL]; Kruskal-Wallis P = .005) and higher overall mortality rates (3 of 14 patients [21.4%] vs 17 of 302 patients [5.6%]; χ(2)(1) = 5.640; P = .02) compared with other variants. Infection by strains lacking the 23403A>G variant showed higher mortality in multivariable analysis (odds ratio [OR], 22.4; 95% CI, 0.6 to 5.6; P = .01). Increased variants of open reading frame (ORF) 3a were associated with decreased hospitalization frequency (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2 to 0.96; P = .04), whereas increased variants of Spike (OR, 0.01; 95% CI, <0.01 to 0.3; P = .01) and ORF8 (OR, 0.03; 95% CI, <0.01 to 0.6; P = .03) were associated with increased survival. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Within weeks of SARS-CoV-2 circulation, a profound shift toward 23403A>G (D614G) specific genotypes occurred. Replaced clades were associated with worse clinical outcomes, including mortality. These findings help explain persistent hospitalization yet decreasing mortality as the pandemic progresses. SARS-CoV-2 clade assignment is an important factor that may aid in estimating patient outcomes.","Esper, Frank P.; Cheng, Yu-Wei; Adhikari, Thamali M.; Tu, Zheng Jin; Li, Derek; Li, Erik A.; Farkas, Daniel H.; Procop, Gary W.; Ko, Jennifer S.; Chan, Timothy A.; Jehi, Lara; Rubin, Brian P.; Li, Jing",JAMA Netw Open,331,16

The NHS in England stopped most non-urgent work by March 2020, but later recommended that services should be restored to near-normal levels before winter where possible. The authors are developing the OpenSAFELY NHS Service Restoration Observatory, using data to describe changes in service activity during COVID-19, and reviewing signals for action with commissioners, researchers and clinicians. Here we report phase one: generating, managing, and describing the data. Objective To describe the volume and variation of coded clinical activity in English primary care across 23.8 million patients records, taking respiratory disease and laboratory procedures as key examples. Methods Working on behalf of NHS England we developed an open source software framework for data management and analysis to describe trends and variation in clinical activity across primary care EHR data on 23.8 million patients; and conducted a population cohort-based study to describe activity using CTV3 coding hierarchy and keyword searches from January 2019-September 2020. Results Much activity recorded in general practice declined to some extent during the pandemic, but largely recovered by September 2020, with some exceptions. There was a large drop in coded activity for commonly used laboratory tests, with broad recovery to pre-pandemic levels by September. One exception was blood coagulation tests such as International Normalised Ratio (INR), with a smaller reduction (median tests per 1000 patients in 2020: February 8.0; April 6.2; September 7.0). The overall pattern of recording for respiratory symptoms was less affected, following an expected seasonal pattern and classified as no change from the previous year. Respiratory tract infections exhibited a sustained drop compared with pre-pandemic levels, not returning to pre-pandemic levels by September 2020. Various COVID-19 codes increased through the period. We observed a small decline associated with high level codes for long-term respiratory conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Asthma annual reviews experienced a small drop but since recovered, while COPD annual reviews remain below baseline. Conclusions We successfully delivered an open source software framework to describe trends and variation in clinical activity across an unprecedented scale of primary care data. The COVD-19 pandemic led to a substantial change in healthcare activity. Most laboratory tests showed substantial reduction, largely recovering to near-normal levels by September 2020, with some important tests less affected. Records of respiratory infections decreased with the exception of codes related to COVID-19, whilst activity of other respiratory disease codes was mixed. We are expanding the NHS Service Restoration Observatory in collaboration with clinicians, commissioners and researchers and welcome feedback.","Curtis, H. J.; MacKenna, B.; Walker, A.

We could isolate similar but not identical variant virus after infection of cultured neural cells from rat brain with wt JHMV (designated CNS virus), which also had a larger mRNA3 and produced larger envelope E2 glycoprotein in infected cells. CNS virus multiplied to a higher degree in cultured astrocytes from rat than wt JHMV and cl-2. During infection with these variant viruses in neural cells, virus populations generated did not change, in contrast to consistent selection of viruses with larger mRNA3 after wt JHMV infections. CNS virus produced abundant mRNA2a as well as 65K glycoprotein while the productions of both were trace in cl-2 infected cells. The present experiments, together with our previous observation, suggest that the larger E2 glycoprotein may be of importance for the replication in rat brain cells.","Taguchi, Fumihiro; Massa, Paul T.; Meulen, Volker Ter",Virology,331,1

Cellular assays allowing a precise quantification of viral replication in high-throughput experimental settings are essential to the screening of chemical libraries and the selection of best antiviral chemical structures. To develop a reporting system for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we generated cell lines expressing a firefly luciferase maintained in an inactive form by a consensus cleavage site for the viral protease 3CL(Pro) of coronaviruses, so that the luminescent biosensor is turned on upon 3CL(Pro) expression or SARS-CoV-2 infection. This cellular assay was used to screen a metabolism-oriented library of 492 compounds to identify metabolic vulnerabilities of coronaviruses for developing innovative therapeutic strategies. In agreement with recent reports, inhibitors of pyrimidine biosynthesis were found to prevent SARS-CoV-2 replication. Among the top hits, we also identified the NADPH oxidase (NOX) inhibitor Setanaxib. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of Setanaxib was further confirmed using ACE2-expressing human pulmonary cells Beas2B as well as human primary nasal epithelial cells. Altogether, these results validate our cell-based functional assay and the interest of screening libraries of different origins to identify inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 for drug repurposing or development.","Mathieu, Cyrille; Touret, Franck; Jacquemin, Clémence; Janin, Yves L.; Nougairède, Antoine; Brailly, Manon; Mazelier, Magalie; Décimo, Didier; Vasseur, Virginie; Hans, Aymeric; Valle-Casuso, José-Carlos; de Lamballerie, Xavier; Horvat, Branka; André, Patrice; Si-Tahar, Mustapha; Lotteau, Vincent; Vidalain, Pierre-Olivier",Viruses,331,32

A novel coronavirus, the SARS-CoV2, was revealed to be the cause of COVID19, the pandemic disease that already provoked more than 555.324 deaths in the world (July 10, 2020). No vaccine treatment has been defined against SARS-CoV2 or other human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including those causing epidemic infections, neither appropriate strategies for prevention and care are yet officially suggested. SCOPE AND APPROACH: . We reviewed scientific literature on natural compounds that were defined as potentially effective against human coronaviruses. Our desk research identified non-chemically modified natural compounds that were shown (in vitro) and/or predicted (in silico) to act against one or more phases of human coronaviruses cell cycle. We selected all available information, merged and annotated the data to define a comprehensive list of natural compounds, describing their chemical classification, the source, the action, the specific target in the viral infection. Our aim was to collect possible compounds for prevention and care against human coronaviruses. KEY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: . The definition of appropriate interventions against viral diseases need a comprehensive view on the infection dynamics and on necessary treatments. Viral targeting compounds to be exploited in food sciences could be of relevant interest to this aim. We collected 174 natural compounds showing effects against human infecting coronaviruses, providing a curated annotation on actions and targets. The data are available in anti-HCoV, a web accessible resource to be exploited for testing and in vivo trials. The website is here launched to favour a community based cooperative effort to call for contribution and expand the collection.

With no antiviral drugs nor vaccines, and the presence of carriers without obvious symptoms, traditional public health intervention measures are significantly less effective. Here, we report the epidemiological and virological characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak. Originated in bats, 2019-nCoV/ severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 likely experienced adaptive evolution in intermediate hosts before transfer to humans at a concentrated source of transmission. Similarities of receptor sequence binding to 2019-nCoV between humans and animals suggest a low species barrier for transmission of the virus to farm animals. We propose, based on the One Health model, that veterinarians and animal specialists should be involved in a cross-disciplinary collaboration in the fight against this epidemic.","Sun, Jiumeng; He, Wan-Ting; Wang, Lifang; Lai, Alexander; Ji, Xiang; Zhai, Xiaofeng; Li, Gairu; Suchard, Marc A.; Tian, Jin; Zhou, Jiyong; Veit, Michael; Su, Shuo",Trends Mol Med,331,15

Whether subcutaneous REGEN-COV prevents severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and subsequent Covid-19 in persons at high risk for infection because of household exposure to a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. METHODS: We randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, participants (≥12 years of age) who were enrolled within 96 hours after a household contact received a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection to receive a total dose of 1200 mg of REGEN-COV or matching placebo administered by means of subcutaneous injection. At the time of randomization, participants were stratified according to the results of the local diagnostic assay for SARS-CoV-2 and according to age. The primary efficacy end point was the development of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection through day 28 in participants who did not have SARS-COV-2 infection (as measured by reverse-transcriptase–quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction assay) or previous immunity (seronegativity). RESULTS: Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection developed in 11 of 753 participants in the REGEN-COV group (1.5%) and in 59 of 752 participants in the placebo group (7.8%) (relative risk reduction [1 minus the relative risk], 81.4%; P<0.001). In weeks 2 to 4, a total of 2 of 753 participants in the REGEN-COV group (0.3%) and 27 of 752 participants in the placebo group (3.6%) had symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (relative risk reduction, 92.6%). REGEN-COV also prevented symptomatic and asymptomatic infections overall (relative risk reduction, 66.4%). Among symptomatic infected participants, the median time to resolution of symptoms was 2 weeks shorter with REGEN-COV than with placebo (1.2 weeks and 3.2 weeks, respectively), and the duration of a high viral load (>10(4) copies per milliliter) was shorter (0.4 weeks and 1.3 weeks, respectively). No dose-limiting toxic effects of REGEN-COV were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Subcutaneous REGEN-COV prevented symptomatic Covid-19 and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in previously uninfected household contacts of infected persons. Among the participants who became infected, REGEN-COV reduced the duration of symptomatic disease and the duration of a high viral load.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Clinic closure was appraised as stressful due to uncertainty and threat to the attainability of the parenthood goal but patients were able to cope using strategies that fit the uncertainty of the situation. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Psychological research on COVID-19 suggests that people are more anxious than historical norms and moderately to extremely upset about fertility treatment cancellation owing to COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The study was of cross-sectional design, comprising a mixed-methods, English language, anonymous, online survey posted from April 09 to April 21 to social media. Eligibility criteria were being affected by COVID-19 fertility clinic closure, 18 years of age or older and able to complete the survey in English. In total, 946 people clicked on the survey link, 76 did not consent, 420 started but did not complete survey, and 450 completed (48% completion, 446 women, four men). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Overall 74.7% (n = 336) of respondents were residents in the UK with an average age of 33.6 years (SD = 4.4) and average years trying to conceive, 3.5 years (SD = 2.22). The survey comprised quantitative questions about the intensity of cognitive appraisals and emotions about clinic closure, and ability to cope with clinic closure. Open-text questions covered their understanding of COVID-19 and its effect on reproductive health and fertility plans, concerns and perceived benefits of clinic closure, and knowledge about closure. Sociodemographic information was collected. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used on quantitative data. Thematic qualitative analysis (inductive coding) was performed on the textual data from each question. Deductive coding grouped themes from each question into meta-themes related to cognitive stress and coping theory. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Most patients (81.6%, n = 367) had tests or treatments postponed, with these being self (41.3%, n = 186) or publicly (46.4%, n = 209) funded. Patients appraised fertility clinic closure as having potential for a more negative than positive impact on their lives, and to be very or extremely uncontrollable and stressful (p ≤ .001). Most reported a slight to moderate ability to cope with closure. Data saturation was achieved with all open-text questions, with 33 broad themes identified and four meta-themes linked to components of the cognitive stress and coping theory. First, participants understood clinic closure was precautionary due to unknown effects of COVID-19 but some felt clinic closure was unfair relative to advice about getting pregnant given to the public. Second, closure was appraised as a threat to attainability of the parenthood goal largely due to uncertainty of the situation (e.g., re-opening, effect of delay) and intensification of pre-existing hardships of fertility problems (e.g., long time waiting for treatment, history of failed treatment). Third, closure taxed personal coping resources but most were able to cope using thought-management (e.g., distraction, focusing on positives), getting mentally and physically fit for next treatments, strengthening their social network, and keeping up-to-date. Finally, participants reported more negative than positive emotions (p ≤ .001) and almost all participants reported stress, worry and frustration at the situation, while some expressed anger and resentment at the unfairness of the situation. Overall, 11.9% were not at all able to cope, with reports of intense feelings of hopelessness and deteriorating wellbeing and mental health. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The survey captures patient reactions at a specific point in time, during lockdown and before clinics announced re-opening. Participants were self-selected (e.g., UK residents, women, 48% starting but not completing the survey), which may affect generalisability. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Fertility stakeholders (e.g., clinics, patient support groups, regulators, professional societies) need to work together to address the great uncertainty from COVID-19. This goal can be met proactively by setting up transparent processes for COVID-19 eventualities and signposting to information and coping resources. Future psychological research priorities should be on identifying patients at risk of distress with standardised measures and developing digital technologies appropriate for the realities of fertility care under COVID-19.

Methods: We included 229 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in a multicenter, retrospective cohort study. Propensity score matching at a ratio of 1:3 was introduced to eliminate potential confounders. Patients were assigned to the ACEI/ARB group (n = 38) or control group (n = 114) according to whether they were current users of medication. Results: Compared to the control group, patients in the ACEI/ARB group had lower levels of plasma IL-1β [(6.20 ± 0.38) vs. (9.30 ± 0.31) pg/ml, P = 0.020], IL-6 [(31.86 ± 4.07) vs. (48.47 ± 3.11) pg/ml, P = 0.041], IL-8 [(34.66 ± 1.90) vs. (47.93 ± 1.21) pg/ml, P = 0.027], and TNF-α [(6.11 ± 0.88) vs. (12.73 ± 0.26) pg/ml, P < 0.01]. Current users of ACEIs/ARBs seemed to have a higher rate of vasoconstrictive agents (20 vs. 6%, P < 0.01) than the control group. Decreased lymphocyte counts [(0.76 ± 0.31) vs. (1.01 ± 0.45)(*)10(9)/L, P = 0.027] and elevated plasma levels of IL-10 [(9.91 ± 0.42) vs. (5.26 ± 0.21) pg/ml, P = 0.012] were also important discoveries in the ACEI/ARB group. Patients in the ACEI/ARB group had a prolonged duration of viral shedding [(24 ± 5) vs. (18 ± 5) days, P = 0.034] and increased length of hospitalization [(24 ± 11) vs. (15 ± 7) days, P < 0.01]. These trends were similar in patients with hypertension. Conclusions: Our findings did not provide evidence for a significant association between ACEI/ARB treatment and COVID-19 mortality. ACEIs/ARBs might decrease proinflammatory cytokines, but antiviral treatment should be enforced, and hemodynamics should be monitored closely. Since the limited influence on the ACEI/ARB treatment, they should not be withdrawn if there was no formal contraindication.","Huang, Linna; Chen, Ziying; Ni, Lan; Chen, Lei; Zhou, Changzhi; Gao, Chang; Wu, Xiaojing; Hua, Lin; Huang, Xu; Cui, Xiaoyang; Tian, Ye; Zhang, Zeyu; Zhan, Qingyuan",Front Cardiovasc Med,331,16

Thousands of studies are being devoted to understanding its epidemiology, its molecular characteristics, its mechanisms, and the clinical evolution of this viral infection. However, little has been published on its pathogenesis and the host response mechanisms in the progress of the disease. Therefore, we propose a hypothesis based on strong scientific documentation, associating oxidative stress with changes found in patients with COVID-19, such as its participation in the amplification and perpetuation of the cytokine storm, coagulopathy, and cell hypoxia. Finally, we suggest a therapeutic strategy to reduce oxidative stress using antioxidants, NFkB inhibitors, Nrf2 activators, and iron complexing agents. We believe that this hypothesis can guide new studies and therapeutic strategies on this topic.","Cecchini, Rubens; Lourenço Cecchini, Alessandra",Med Hypotheses,331,20

Surge events frequently challenge Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs), where robust routine EC is required for resilient health systems. We aimed to describe the current status, determine priority actions and set minimum standards for EC systems development across the Pacific region. Methods We used a prospective, multiphase, expert consensus process to collect data from PICT EC stakeholders using focus groups, electronic surveys and panel review between August 2018 and April 2019. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, consensus agreement and graphic interpretation. We structured the research according to the World Health Organisation EC Systems and building block framework adapted for the Pacific context. Findings Over 200 participants from 17 PICTs engaged in at least one component of the multiphase process. Gaps in functional capacity exist in most PICTs for both facility-based and pre-hospital care. EC is a low priority across the Pacific and integrated poorly with disaster plans. Participants emphasised human resource support and government recognition of EC as priority actions, and generated 24 facility-based and 22 pre-hospital Pacific EC standards across all building blocks. Interpretation PICT stakeholders now have baseline indicators and a comprehensive roadmap for EC development within a globally recognised health systems framework. This study generates practical, context-appropriate tools to trigger further research, conduct evidence-based advocacy, drive future improvements and measure progress towards achieving universal health access for Pacific peoples.

However, the conditions faced by specific populations vary according to social, structural and environmental factors, including stigma and discrimination, criminalization, social and economic safety nets and the local epidemiology of HIV and COVID‐19, which determine risk of exposure and vulnerability to adverse health outcomes, as well as the ability to comply with measures such as physical distancing. This commentary identifies common vulnerabilities and cross‐cutting themes in terms of the impacts of COVID‐19 on key populations before addressing issues and concerns specific to particular populations. DISCUSSION: Cross‐cutting themes include direct impacts such as disrupted access to essential medicines, commodities and services such as anti‐retroviral treatment, HIV pre‐exposure prophylaxis, opioid agonist treatment, viral load monitoring, HIV and sexually transmitted infections testing, condoms and syringes. Indirect impacts include significant collateral damage arising from prevention measures which restrict human rights, increase or impose criminal penalties, and expand police powers to target vulnerable and criminalized populations. Significant heterogeneity in the COVID‐19 pandemic, the underlying HIV epidemic and the ability of key populations to protect themselves means that people who inject drugs and sex workers face particular challenges, including indirect impacts as a result of police targeting, loss of income and sometimes both. Geographical variations mean that transgender people and men who have sex with men in regions like Africa and the middle east remain criminalized, as well as stigmatized and discriminated against, increasing their vulnerability to adverse outcomes in relation to COVID‐19. CONCLUSIONS: Disruptions to both licit and illicit supply chains, loss of income and livelihoods and changes in behaviour as a result of lockdowns and physical distancing have the potential to exacerbate the impacts of the COVID‐19 pandemic on key populations. While these impacts will vary significantly, human‐rights approaches to COVID‐19 emergency laws and public health prevention measures that are population‐specific and sensitive, will be key to reducing adverse health outcomes and ensuring that no one is left behind.","Iversen, Jenny; Sabin, Keith; Chang, Judy; Morgan Thomas, Ruth; Prestage, Garrett; Strathdee, Steffanie A; Maher, Lisa",J Int AIDS Soc,331,1

While diabetes is known to aggravate COVID‐19 severity, it is not known whether nondiabetic patients with metabolic dysfunction are also more prone to more severe disease. The association of metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) with COVID‐19 severity in nondiabetic patients was investigated here. METHODS: The study cohort comprised 65 patients with (i.e. cases) and 65 patients without MAFLD (i.e. controls). Each case was randomly matched with one control by sex (1:1) and age (±5 years). The association between the presence of MAFLD (as exposure) and COVID‐19 severity (as the outcome) was assessed by binary logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: In nondiabetic patients with COVID‐19, the presence of MAFLD was associated with a four‐fold increased risk of severe COVID‐19; the risk increased with increasing numbers of metabolic risk factors. The association with COVID‐19 severity persisted after adjusting for age, sex, and coexisting morbid conditions.

HDSS occupy a grey area between research, healthcare and public health practice and it is unclear how ethics guidance that rely on a research-practice distinction apply to HDSS. This topic has received little attention in the literature. In this paper, based on empirical research across sub-Saharan Africa, we map out key ethical issues for HDSS and assess the relevance of current ethics guidance in relation to these findings. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study across seven HDSS sites in sub-Saharan Africa, including individual in-depth interviews and informal discussions with 68 research staff, document reviews and non-participant observations of surveillance activities. Qualitative data analysis drew on a framework approach led by a priori and emergent themes, drawing on the wider ethics and social science literature. RESULTS: There were diverse views on core ethical issues in HDSS, including regarding the strengths and challenges of community engagement, informed consent and data sharing processes. A key emerging issue was unfairness in the overall balance of benefits and burdens for residents and front-line staff when compared with other stakeholders, particularly given the socioeconomic contexts in which HDSS are generally conducted. CONCLUSION: We argue that HDSS operate as non-traditional epidemiologic research projects but are often governed using ethics guidance developed for traditional forms of health research. There is a need for specific ethics guidance for HDSS which prioritises considerations around fairness, cost-effectiveness, ancillary care responsibilities, longitudinality and obligations of the global community to HDSS residents.","Hinga, Alex Nginyo; Molyneux, Sassy; Marsh, Vicki",BMJ Glob Health,331,24

Beyond a preference for cleaving RNA 3′ of uridines, it is unknown if Nsp15 has any additional substrate preferences. Here, we used cryo-EM to capture structures of Nsp15 bound to RNA in pre- and post-cleavage states. The structures along with molecular dynamics and biochemical assays revealed critical residues involved in substrate specificity, nuclease activity, and oligomerization. Moreover, we determined how the sequence of the RNA substrate dictates cleavage and found that outside of polyU tracts, Nsp15 has a strong preference for purines 3′ of the cleaved uridine. This work advances our understanding of how Nsp15 recognizes and processes viral RNA, and will aid in the development of new anti-viral therapeutics.","Frazier, Meredith N; Dillard, Lucas B; Krahn, Juno M; Perera, Lalith; Williams, Jason G; Wilson, Isha M; Stewart, Zachary D; Pillon, Monica C; Deterding, Leesa J; Borgnia, Mario J; Stanley, Robin E",Nucleic Acids Res,331,1

Patients with co-morbidities such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus (DM) seem to be more prone to severe symptoms and appear to have a higher mortality rate. In this review, we elucidate suggested mechanisms underlying the increased susceptibility of patients with diabetes to infection with SARS-CoV-2 with a more severe COVID-19 disease. The worsened prognosis of COVID-19 patients with DM can be attributed to a facilitated viral uptake assisted by the host’s receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). It can also be associated with a higher basal level of pro-inflammatory cytokines present in patients with diabetes, which enables a hyperinflammatory “cytokine storm” in response to the virus. This review also suggests a link between elevated levels of IL-6 and AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway and their role in exacerbating diabetes-induced complications and insulin resistance. If further studied, these findings could help identify novel therapeutic intervention strategies for patients with diabetes comorbid with COVID-19.","Azar, William S.; Njeim, Rachel; Fares, Angie H.; Azar, Nadim S.; Azar, Sami T.; El Sayed, Mazen; Eid, Assaad A.",Rev Endocr Metab Disord,331,27

OBJECTIVES: To assess the timeframe and potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from hospitalized COVID-19 patients in relation to antibody response. METHOD: We performed a cross-sectional study of 36 COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Karolinska University Hospital. Patients with more than 8 days of symptom duration were sampled from airways, for PCR analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and in vitro culture of replicating virus. Serum SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and neutralizing antibodies titers were assessed by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and microneutralization assay. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in airway samples in 23 patients (symptom duration median 15 days, range 9–53 days), whereas 13 patients were SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative (symptom duration median 21 days, range 10–37 days). Replicating virus was detected in samples from 4 patients at 9–16 days. All but two patients had detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG in serum, and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were detected in 33 out of 36 patients. Total SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG titers and neutralizing antibody titers were positively correlated. High levels of both total IgG and neutralizing antibody titers were observed in patients sampled later after symptom onset and in patients where replicating virus could not be detected. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the presence of SARS-Cov-2 specific antibodies in serum may indicate a lower risk of shedding infectious SARS-CoV-2 by hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Glans, Hedvig; Gredmark-Russ, Sara; Olausson, Mikaela; Falck-Jones, Sara; Varnaite, Renata; Christ, Wanda; Maleki, Kimia T.; Karlberg, Maria Lind; Broddesson, Sandra; Falck-Jones, Ryan; Bell, Max; Johansson, Niclas; Färnert, Anna; Smed-Sörensen, Anna; Klingström, Jonas; Bråve, Andreas",BMC Infect Dis,331,22

Patients who require weeks of intravenous antibiotic therapy after hospital discharge due to severe bacterial infections, generally referred to as outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT), are at increased risk for contracting and/or transmitting COVID-19 due to extensive contact with the health care system. To reduce the risk of COVID-19 among this vulnerable patient population, providers overseeing OPAT care need to consider the relative safety of the different OPAT sites of care. Home-based OPAT should be emphasized to minimize hospital stays and prevent skilled nursing facility admissions.

Healthcare workers are not only at heightened risk of infection, but also of adverse mental health outcomes. Identification of organizational, collegial and individual risk and resilience factors impacting the mental health of healthcare workers are needed to inform preparedness planning and sustainable response. Methods: We performed a rapid systematic review to identify, assess and summarize available research on the mental health impact of the covid-19 pandemic on healthcare workers. On 11 May 2020, we utilized the Norwegian Institute of Public Health's Live map of covid-19 evidence, the visualization of a database of 20,738 screened studies, to identify studies for inclusion. We included studies reporting on any type of mental health outcome in any type of healthcare workers during the pandemic. We described interventions reported by the studies, and narratively summarized mental health-related outcomes, as study heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis. We assessed study quality using design-specific instruments. Results: We included 59 studies, reporting on a total of 54,707 healthcare workers. The prevalence of general psychological distress across the studies ranged from 7-97% (median 37%), anxiety 9-90% (median 24%), depression 5-51% (median 21%), and sleeping problems 34-65% (median 37%). Seven studies reported on implementing mental health interventions, and most focused on individual symptom reduction, but none reported on effects of the interventions. In most studies, healthcare workers reported low interest in and use of professional help, and greater reliance on social support and contact with family and friends. Exposure to covid-19 was the most commonly reported correlate of mental health problems, followed by female gender, and worry about infection or about infecting others. Social support correlated with less mental health problems. Discussion: Healthcare workers in a variety of fields, positions, and exposure risks are reporting anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and distress during the covid-19 pandemic, but most studies do not report comparative data on mental health symptoms. before the pandemic. There seems to be a mismatch between risk factors for adverse mental health outcomes among healthcare workers in the current pandemic and their needs and preferences, and the individual psychopathology focus of current interventions. Efforts to help healthcare workers sustain healthy relationships to colleagues, family and friends over time may be paramount to safeguard what is already an important source of support during the prolonged crisis. Expanding interventions' focus to incorporate organizational, collegial and family factors to support healthcare workers responding to the pandemic could improve acceptability and efficacy of interventions.

SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the betacoronavirus genus. Due to the error-prone nature of the viral RNA-dependent polymerase complex, coronaviruses are known to acquire new mutations at each cycle of genome replication. This constitutes one of the main factors driving the evolution of its relatively large genome and the emergence of new genetic variants. In the past few months, the identification of new B.1.1.7 (United Kingdom), B.1.351 (South Africa), and P.1 (Brazil) variants of concern (VOC) has highlighted the importance of tracking the emergence of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome that impact transmissibility, virulence, and immune and neutralizing antibody escape. Here we analyzed the appearance and prevalence trajectory over time of mutations that appeared in all SARS-CoV-2 genes from December 2019 to April 2021. The goal of the study was to identify which genetic modifications are the most frequent and study the dynamics of their propagation, their incorporation into the consensus sequence, and their impact on virus biology. We also analyzed the structural properties of the spike glycoprotein of the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 variants for its binding to the host receptor ACE2. This study offers an integrative view of the emergence, disappearance, and consensus sequence integration of successful mutations that constitute new SARS-CoV-2 variants and their impact on neutralizing antibody therapeutics and vaccines.","Castonguay, Nicolas; Zhang, Wandong; Langlois, Marc-André",Front Microbiol,331,20

The current study investigated the SARS-CoV-2 infection status and antibody responses in 157 patients seeking care for a respiratory disease suggestive of COVID-19 in private healthcare clinics during the first wave (June-October 2020) of infections in Nicaragua. We examined nasal swabs for the presence of viral RNA via RT-PCR and longitudinally collected sera for the changes in SARS-CoV-2 Spike antibody levels over six months. Among patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, we evaluated if clinical symptoms were associated with age, hematological parameters and co-morbidities. The combination of PCR and paired serology identified 60 (38%) of the 157 outpatients as acute COVID-19. While both PCR and serology identified the majority (n = 38, 64%) of the acute infections, a notable number of outpatients were identified by RT-qPCR (n = 13, 22%) or by serology (n = 9, 14%) only. During the longitudinal study, we identified 6 new infections by serology among the 97 non-COVID-19 subjects. In conclusion, this study report that more than one third of the outpatients seeking care for acute respiratory disease during the first epidemic wave of SARS-CoV-2 in Nicaragua had an acute mild COVID-19 infection that correlate with prolonged humoral response. This immune response to the RBD antigen, more likely IgG dependent, significantly increased between the acute to convalescent and decay in the late convalescent but still remained seropositive.","Bucardo, F.; Gonzalez, F.; Zepeda, O.; Toval Ruiz, C.

One of the most intriguing fields of application for such systems include the assessment of physiological responses to sensory stimuli. In this specific regard, it is not yet known which are the main psychophysiological drivers of olfactory-related pleasantness, as the current literature has demonstrated the relationship between odor familiarity and odor valence, but has not clarified the consequentiality between the two domains. Here, we enrolled a group of university students to whom olfactory training lasting 3 months was administered. Thanks to the analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) and galvanic skin response (GSR) signals at the beginning and at the end of the training period, we observed different autonomic responses, with higher parasympathetically-mediated response at the end of the period with respect to the first evaluation. This possibly suggests that an increased familiarity to the proposed stimuli would lead to a higher tendency towards relaxation. Such results could suggest potential applications to other domains, including personalized treatments based on odors and foods in neuropsychiatric and eating disorders.","Tonacci, Alessandro; Billeci, Lucia; Di Mambro, Irene; Marangoni, Roberto; Sanmartin, Chiara; Venturi, Francesca",Sensors (Basel),331,20

The outbreak was able to be controlled in China by mid-April through the implementation of critical measures; however, significant reverse transmission has resulted in hot spots perturbing prevention and control. To date, there have only been a total of 92 indigenous COVID-19 cases confirmed in the Gansu Province, which is considered to be a consequence of the strict screening approach applied during the outbreak. The emergency response level to COVID-19 were able to be decreased from high to low, despite some relatively minor reverse transmission cases from other countries in March 2020. The stringent preparative measures undertaken by the Gansu authorities, involving high-level, streamlined cooperation between the transportation, quarantine, and medical resource departments, have underpinned this success. There has been an emergence of clusters of freshly infected COVID-19 patients in the Jilin Province in northeast China. The single largest cluster has been in Shulan of the Jilin Province, involving 43 confirmed infections. A strict lockdown was implemented immediately. The source of the current outbreak of COVID-19 is suggested to be travelers returning from Russia. The current strategy from the Chinese authorities is aimed at preventing reverse transmission via international importation to avert a rebound of COVID-19 in China. These data highlight the need for an exceptionally high level of vigilance and for a pre-emptive response that is informative for the development of policy to prevent a second and further waves of infections in general.","Fan, Jingchun; Hambly, Brett D.; Bao, Shisan",Front Public Health,331,2

The current mutagenesis and in silico protein design methods are confined by the limited throughput and high cost, while the high-throughput phage display and yeast display technologies are not suitable for screening glycosylated Fc variants. Here we developed a mammalian cell display-based Fc engineering platform. Methods: By using mammalian cell display and next generation sequencing, we screened millions of Fc variants for optimized affinity and specificity for FcγRIIIa or FcγRIIb. The identified Fc variants with improved binding to FcγRIIIa were substituted into trastuzumab and rituximab and the effector function of antibodies were examined in the PBMC-based assay. On the other hand, the identified Fc variants with selectively enhanced FcγRIIb binding were applied to CD40 agonist antibody and the activities of the antibodies were measured on different cell assays. The immunostimulatory activity of CD40 antibodies was also evaluated by OVA-specific CD8(+) T cell response model in FcγR/CD40-humanized mice. Results: Using this approach, we screened millions of Fc variant and successfully identified several novel Fc variants with enhanced FcγRIIIa or FcγRIIb binding. These identified Fc variants displayed a dramatic increase in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in PBMC-based assay. Novel variants with selectively enhanced FcγRIIb binding were also identified. CD40 agonist antibodies substituted with these Fc variants displayed activity more potent than the parental antibody in the in vitro and in vivo models. Conclusions: This approach increased the throughput of Fc variant screening from thousands to millions magnitude, enabled screening variants containing multiple mutations and could be integrated with glycoengineering technology, represents an ideal platform for Fc engineering. The initial efforts demonstrated the capability of the platform and the novel Fc variants could be substituted into nearly any antibody for the next generation of antibody therapeutics.","Chen, Da; Zhao, Yingjie; Li, Mingyu; Shang, Hang; Li, Na; Li, Fan; Wang, Wei; Wang, Yuan; Jin, Ruina; Liu, Shiyu; Li, Xun; Gao, Shan; Tian, Yujie; Li, Ruonan; Li, Huanhuan; Zhang, Yongyan; Du, Mingjuan; Cao, Youjia; Zhang, Yan; Li, Xin; Huang, Yi; Hu, Liaoyuan A.; Li, Fubin; Zhang, Hongkai",Theranostics,331,16

Since March 2020, the COVID-19 Health System Response Monitor, a joint initiative of the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, the WHO Regional Office for Europe, and the European Commission, has documented country responses to COVID-19 using a structured template which includes a section on provision of care. Using the information available on the platform, this paper analyzes how countries planned services for potential surge capacity, designed patient flows ensuring separation between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, and maintained routine services in both hospital and ambulatory settings. Despite very real differences in the organization of health and care services, there were many similarities in country responses. These include transitioning the management of COVID-19 mild cases from hospitals to outpatient settings, increasing the use of remote consultations, and cancelling or postponing non-urgent services during the height of the first wave. In the immediate future, countries will have to continue balancing care for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients to minimize adverse health outcomes, ideally with supporting guidelines and COVID-19-specific care zones.

Transport authorities have implemented several strategies to reduce traffic jams with varying degrees of success. The use of reversible lanes is a common approach to improve traffic congestion during rush hours. A reversible lane can change its direction during a time interval to the more congested direction. This strategy can improve traffic congestion in specific scenarios. Most reversible lanes in urban roads are fixed in time and number; however, traffic patterns in cities are highly variable and unpredictable due to this phenomenon’s complex nature. Therefore, reversible lanes may not improve traffic flow under certain circumstances; moreover, they could worsen it because of traffic fluctuations. In this paper, we use cellular automata to model adaptive reversible lanes(aka dynamic reversible lanes). Adaptive reversible lanes can change their direction using real-time information to respond to traffic demand fluctuations. Using real traffic data, our model shows that adaptive reversible lanes can improve traffic flow up to 40% compared to conventional reversible lanes. Our results show that there are significant fluctuations in traffic flow even during rush hours, and thus cities would benefit from implementing adaptive reversible lanes.","Pérez-Méndez, Dante; Gershenson, Carlos; Lárraga, María Elena; Mateos, José L.",PLoS One,331,6

Indeed, T cell activation, differentiation, and effector function partly depend on alterations in metabolic pathways with different cell types and functionality favoring either glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation. While immune system dysfunction with aging is well described, what remains less elucidated is how the integral networks that control immune cell metabolism are specifically affected by age. In recent years, this significant gap has been identified and work has begun to investigate the various ways immunometabolism could be impacted by both chronological age and age-associated symptoms, such as the systemic accumulation of senescent cells. Here, in this mini-review, we will examine immunometabolism with a focus on T cells, aging, and interventions, such as mTOR modulators and senolytics. This review also covers a timely perspective on how immunometabolism may be an ideal target for immunomodulation with aging.","Martin, Dominique E.; Torrance, Blake L.; Haynes, Laura; Bartley, Jenna M.",Front Immunol,331,1

Intravital microscopy of endothelial cell calcium dynamics reveals that calcium increases locally and transiently around the transmigration pore during TEM. Endothelial calmodulin (CaM), a key calcium signaling protein, interacts with the IQ domain of IQGAP1, which is localized to endothelial junctions and is required for TEM. In the presence of calcium, CaM binds endothelial calcium/calmodulin kinase IIδ (CaMKIIδ). Disrupting the function of CaM or CaMKII with small-molecule inhibitors, expression of a CaMKII inhibitory peptide, or expression of dominant negative CaMKIIδ significantly reduces TEM by interfering with the delivery of the lateral border recycling compartment (LBRC) to the site of TEM. Endothelial CaMKII is also required for TEM in vivo as shown in two independent mouse models. These findings highlight novel roles for endothelial CaM and CaMKIIδ in transducing the spatiotemporally restricted calcium signaling required for TEM.","Dalal, Prarthana J.; Sullivan, David P.; Weber, Evan W.; Sacks, David B.; Gunzer, Matthias; Grumbach, Isabella M.; Heller Brown, Joan; Muller, William A.",J Exp Med,331,3

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the feasibility and impact of online therapeutic dancing classes for people in the early to mid-stages of PD. METHODS Co-produced with people living with PD, physiotherapists, dance teachers and the local PD association, the 'ParkinDANCE' program was adapted to enable online delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants completed 8 one-hour sessions of online therapeutic dancing. Each person was assigned their own dance teacher and together they selected music for the classes. A mixed-methods design enabled analysis of feasibility and impact. Feasibility was quantified by attendance and adverse events. Impact was determined from individual narratives pertaining to consumer experiences and engagement, analysed with qualitative methods through a phenomenological lens. RESULTS Attendance was high, with people attending 100% sessions. There were no adverse events. Impact was illustrated by the key themes from the in-depth interviews: (i) a sense of achievement, enjoyment and mastery occurred with online dance; (ii) project co-design facilitated participant engagement; (iii) dance instructor capabilities, knowledge and skills facilitated positive outcomes; (iv) music choices were key; and (v) participants were able to quickly adapt to online delivery with support and resources. CONCLUSIONS Online dance therapy was safe, feasible and perceived to be of benefit in this sample of early adopters. During the pandemic, it was a viable form of structured physical activity. For the future, online dance may afford benefits to health, well-being and social engagement.","Morris, Meg E; Slade, Susan C; Wittwer, Joanne E; Blackberry, Irene; Haines, Simon; Hackney, Madeleine E; McConvey, Victor B",Neurorehabilitation and neural repair,331,1

Upon flavivirus infections, these are significantly altered: on the one hand, these viruses can co-opt lipid metabolic pathways to generate ATP to facilitate replication, or to synthesize membrane components to generate replication sites; on the other hand, more recent evidence suggests counter strategies employed by host cells, which actively modulate several of these networks in response to infection, enhancing interferon signaling by doing so, and thus creating an antiviral environment. In this review, we discuss recent data on mechanisms of alteration of lipid metabolic pathways during infection by flaviviruses, with a focus on cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis, which can be manipulated by the invading viruses to support replication, but can also be modulated by the host immune system itself, as a means to fight infection.","Pombo, Joao Palma; Sanyal, Sumana",Front Immunol,331,11

The 624/I and Q1 genotypes, now recognized to be part of the GI-16 lineage, represent an excellent example of the practical consequences of IBV molecular epidemiology limited knowledge. In fact, being their common origin unrecognized for a long time, independent epidemiological pictures were drawn for the two genotypes. To fix this misinterpretation, the present study reconstructs the history, population dynamics and spreading patterns of GI-16 lineage as a whole using a phylodynamic approach. A collection of worldwide available hypervariable region 1 and 2 (HVR12) and 3 (HVR3) sequences of the S1 protein was analysed together with 258 HVR3 sequences obtained from samples collected in Italy (the country where this genotype was initially identified) since 1963. The results demonstrate that after its emergence at the beginning of the XX century, GI-16 was able to persist until present days in Italy. Approximately in the late 1980s, it migrated to Asia, which became the main nucleus for further spreading to Middle East, Europe and especially South America, likely through multiple introduction events. A remarkable among-country diffusion was also demonstrated in Asia and South America. Interestingly, although most of the recent Italian GI-16 strains originated from ancestral viruses detected in the same country, a couple were closely related to Chinese ones, supporting a backward viral flow from China to Italy. Besides to the specific case-study results, this work highlights the misconceptions that originate from the lack of a unified nomenclature and poor molecular epidemiology data generation and sharing. This shortcoming appears particularly relevant since the described scenario could likely be shared by many other IBV genotypes and pathogens in general.","Franzo, Giovanni; Cecchinato, Mattia; Tosi, Giovanni; Fiorentini, Laura; Faccin, Francesca; Tucciarone, Claudia Maria; Trogu, Tiziana; Barbieri, Ilaria; Massi, Paola; Moreno, Ana",bioRxiv,331,26

When anticipating prolonged ventilation, the patient may proceed to surgical tracheostomy to afford safe respiratory wean. As surgical tracheostomy is an aerosol-generating procedure, it poses a high risk of viral transmission and ultimately may prompt anxiety and caution in participating staff members. We aimed to mitigate these risks by providing staff with appropriate training and experience, to improve their confidence as well as practical ability. METHODS: We developed a multidisciplinary simulation training experience and checklist in order to optimize team performance during the high-stakes procedure. We evaluated staff confidence before and after the training with questionnaires. RESULTS: Post-simulation, surgeons were more confident with donning the high level personal protective equipment, and nurses were more confident in performing their role. CONCLUSIONS: Simulation allows the multidisciplinary team an opportunity to practice high-risk procedures and prompts the team to assess staff knowledge base, troubleshoot queries, and teach roles and responsibilities in a safe environment. In the context of COVID-19, simulation encourages staff sense of preparedness and protection for true participation during a high-risk procedure.","Towning, Rebecca; Rennie, Catherine; Ferguson, Mark",Ear Nose Throat J,331,8

Methods: Pre-COVID-19 Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network Cohort data were linked to COVID-19 data collected April 9 to April 27, 2020. Anxiety symptoms were assessed with the PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0 scale (MCID = 4 points) and depression symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (MCID = 3 points). Multiple linear and logistic regression were used to assess factors associated with continuous change and change [≥] 1 MCID.

Makino, Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. ex DC., and nine other herbs, has been used to treat severe COVID-19 in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical efficacies of HJSS combination therapy and Western monotherapy against severe COVID-19 and to study the potential action mechanism of HJSS. From February 2020 to March 2020, 81 patients with severe COVID-19 in Wuhan Tongji Hospital were selected for retrospective cohort study. Network pharmacology was conducted to predict the possible mechanism of HJSS on COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Targets of active components in HJSS were screened using the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) and PharmMapper databases. The targets of COVID-19 and ARDS were obtained from GeneCards and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man databases. The key targets of HJSS in COVID-19 and ARDS were obtained based on the protein–protein interaction network (PPI). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis (KEGG) was conducted to predict the pathways related to the targets of HJSS in COVID-19 and ARDS. A “herb-ingredient-target-pathway” network was established using Cytoscape 3.2.7. Results showed that the duration of the negative conversion time of nucleic acid was shorter in patients who received HJSS combination therapy. HJSS combination therapy also relieved fever in patients with severe COVID-19. Network pharmacology analysis identified interleukin (IL) 6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), catalase (CAT), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1, tumor protein p53 (TP53), CC-chemokine ligand (CCL2), MAPK3, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), and IL1B as the key targets of HJSS in COVID-19-related ARDS. KEGG analysis suggested that HJSS improved COVID-19-related ARDS by regulating hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1, NOD-like receptor, TNF, T cell receptor, sphingolipid, PI3K-Akt, toll-like receptor, VEGF, FoxO, and MAPK signaling pathways. In conclusion, HJSS can be used as an adjuvant therapy on severe COVID-19.

In the United Kingdom, quarantine and social distancing measures were implemented with immediate effect on 17 March 2020, resulting in a rapid change to the way owners managed and interacted with their horses. We surveyed 6259 horse owners to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on themselves and their horses. The majority of horse owners were visiting and riding their horses less, with increased restrictions experienced by owners who kept their horse at private livery yards. Whilst social distancing and visiting restrictions were in place at livery yards, nearly half were not providing hand sanitization or disinfection protocols for shared areas/equipment to prevent the spread of the virus between owners. Horse owners expressed concern that equine health and welfare would be negatively affected by the restrictions put in place and of financial consequences as a result of the pandemic. The majority of respondents also felt their own mental health and wellbeing was being adversely affected by not being able to visit/interact as they normally would with their horses. Equestrian influencers and national bodies should engage with increased communication and education to support horse owners through the pandemic in the short, medium, and long-term. ABSTRACT: COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic on 11 March 2020; the United Kingdom (UK) implemented quarantine measures shortly afterward, resulting in rapid changes in how owners managed and interacted with their horses. This study provides a rapid analysis of the initial impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the management of UK leisure and competition horses. A 17 question online survey was distributed via equestrian social media sites to ascertain the impact of COVID-19 on horse and yard management and on human–horse interactions. Frequency analysis combined with Chi-squared and thematic analyses identified the impact of COVID-19 on UK horse owners. Major changes within horse management and horse–human interactions were reported for the majority of horse owners (>65%), regardless of the establishment type or region. Social distancing and visiting restrictions were implemented at most yards, but nearly half were not providing hand sanitization or disinfection protocols for the shared areas/equipment to prevent cross-contamination between users. The financial impact of the pandemic combined with restricted access to veterinary professionals resulted in owners expressing concerns that horse health and welfare may be compromised as a result. Horse owners also felt that the reduced opportunities for horse–human interactions were negatively affecting their mental health and wellbeing.","Williams, Jane M.; Randle, Hayley; Marlin, David",Animals (Basel),331,1

We report on the validation of the Vitros Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total (CoV2T) assay for qualitative serological testing of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Methods: We performed validation studies according to COLA guidelines, using samples previously tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. We evaluated precision, analytical interferences, and cross-reactivity with other viral infections. We also evaluated concordance with molecular and other serological testing, and evaluated seroconversion. Results: The Vitros CoV2T assay exhibited acceptable precision, was resistant to analytical interference, and did not exhibit cross-reactivity with samples positive for other respiratory viruses. The CoV2T assay exhibited 100% negative predictive agreement (56/56) and 71% positive predictive agreement (56/79) with RT-PCR across all patient samples, and was concordant with other serological assays. Concordance with RT-PCR was 97% > 7 days after symptom onset. Conclusions: The Vitros CoV2T assay was successfully validated in our laboratory. We anticipate it will be a useful tool in screening for exposure to SARS-CoV-2, however, the use of the CoV2T and other serological assays in clinical management of COVID-19 patients is yet unknown, and must be evaluated in future studies.","Garnett, E.; Jung, J.; Tam, E.; Rajapakshe, D.; Cheney, S.; Brown, C.; Muldrew, K.

Vaccination is a key strategy to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is unclear how readily SOT recipients will get vaccinated against COVID-19. We conducted an internet-based survey to investigate the vaccination willingness among Chinese SOT recipients and further explore possible influencing factors. Eight hundred and thirteen respondents participated in the survey. Overall, 46 (5.7%) recipients were vaccinated against COVID-19, while 767 (94.3%) were not. Among those not vaccinated, 175 (22.8%) intended to be vaccinated, while 592 (77.2%) were categorized as vaccine-hesitant. The most common reason for vaccination hesitancy is fear of preexisting comorbidities, followed by fear of side effects and doctors' negative advice. Factors associated with vaccination willingness were as follows: with liver transplantation, the main source of information on COVID-19 vaccines was from medical doctors, scientists, and scientific journals, with at least college-level education, positive intention toward influenza vaccination during the current season, perceived importance of vaccination for SOT recipients, and having been vaccinated against influenza during the last season. Our survey indicated the necessity for SOT recipients to receive more comprehensive and accessible health education about vaccination and emphasized the critical role of transplantation physicians in promoting vaccine acceptance among SOT recipients.

During transmission, host cell invasion is controlled by a large-scale conformational change of the Spike protein. This conformational rearrangement leads to membrane fusion, which creates transmembrane pores through which the viral genome is passed to the host. During Spike-protein-mediated fusion, the fusion peptides must be released from the core of the protein and associate with the host membrane. Interestingly, the Spike protein possesses many post-translational modifications, in the form of branched glycans that flank the surface of the assembly. Despite the large number of glycosylation sites, until now, the specific role of glycans during cell invasion has been unclear. Here, we propose that glycosylation is needed to provide sufficient time for the fusion peptides to reach the host membrane, otherwise the viral particle would fail to enter the host. To understand this process, an all-atom model with simplified energetics was used to perform thousands of simulations in which the protein transitions between the prefusion and postfusion conformations. These simulations indicate that the steric composition of the glycans induces a pause during the Spike protein conformational change. We additionally show that this glycan-induced delay provides a critical opportunity for the fusion peptides to capture the host cell. This previously-unrecognized role of glycans reveals how the glycosylation state can regulate infectivity of this pervasive pathogen.","Dodero-Rojas, Esteban; Onuchic, José N.; Whitford, Paul C.",bioRxiv,331,1

Healthcare workers are particularly vulnerable in the era of COVID‐19. Physical methods of stress relief such as yoga and massage therapy may reduce occupational stress. The objective of this systematic review and network meta‐analysis is to determine the effects of yoga, massage therapy, progressive muscle relaxation, and stretching on alleviating stress and improving physical and mental health in healthcare workers. METHODS: Databases were searched for randomized controlled trials on the use of physical relaxation methods for occupational stress in healthcare workers with any duration of follow‐up. Meta‐analysis was performed for standard mean differences in stress measures from baseline between subjects undergoing relaxation vs non‐intervention controls. Network meta‐analysis was conducted to determine the best relaxation method. RESULTS: Fifteen trials representing 688 healthcare workers were identified. Random‐effects meta‐analysis shows that physical relaxation methods overall reduced measures of occupational stress at the longest duration of follow‐up vs baseline compared to non‐intervention controls (SMD −0.53; 95% CI [−0.74 to −0.33]; p < .00001). On network meta‐analysis, only yoga alone (SMD −0.71; 95% CI [−1.01 to −0.41]) and massage therapy alone (SMD −0.43; 95% CI [−0.72 to −0.14]) were more effective than control, with yoga identified as the best method (p‐score = .89). CONCLUSION: Physical relaxation may help reduce occupational stress in healthcare workers. Yoga is particularly effective and offers the convenience of online delivery. Employers should consider implementing these methods into workplace wellness programs.","Zhang, Michael; Murphy, Brittany; Cabanilla, Abegail; Yidi, Christina",J Occup Health,331,20

METHODS: All consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 11 to February 6, 2020, were included in this study. RESULTS: A total of 663 patients with COVID-19 were included, while 67 patients with T2DM accounted for 10.1% of the total. Compared with patients with COVID-19 without T2DM, those with T2DM were older (aged 66 years vs 57 years; P < 0.001) and had a male predominance (62.7% vs 37.3%; P = 0.019) and higher prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (61.2% vs 20.6%; P < 0.001) and urinary diseases (9% vs 2.5%; P = 0.014). Patients with T2DM were prone to developing severe (58.2% vs 46.3%; P = 0.002) and critical COVID-19 (20.9% vs 13.4%; P = 0.002) and having poor therapeutic effect (76.1% vs 60.4%; P = 0.017). But there was no obvious difference in the mortality between patients with COVID-19 with and without T2DM (4.5% vs 3.7%; P = 0.732). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified that T2DM was associated with poor therapeutic effect in patients with COVID-19 (odd ratio [OR] 2.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-8.66; P = 0.04). Moreover, having a severe and critical COVID-19 condition (OR 3.27; 95% CI, 1.02-9.00; P = 0.029) and decreased lymphocytes (OR 1.59; 95% CI, 1.10-2.34; P = 0.016) were independent risk factors associated with poor therapeutic effect in patients with COVID-19 with T2DM. CONCLUSIONS: T2DM influenced the disease severity and therapeutic effect and was one of the independent risk factors for poor therapeutic effect in patients with COVID-19.","Wang, Xiaoli; Liu, Zhengru; Li, Jiao; Zhang, Jixiang; Tian, Shan; Lu, Shimin; Qi, Mingming; Ma, Jingjing; Qiu, Bo; Dong, Weiguo; Xu, Yu",J Clin Endocrinol Metab,331,16

Both cutaneous lymphoma and immunosuppressive treatment can contribute to the development of more severe COVID-19 complications. The real challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic remains the management of the advanced and aggressive forms of cutaneous lymphomas, including late-stage mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS). Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is one of those treatments. ECP is considered high risk therapy according to the United States Cutaneous Lymphoma Consortium recommendations for treatment of cutaneous lymphomas during the COVID-19 pandemic because it may require travel to the clinic or hospital. Methods: In this cross-sectional retrospective study, data of patients with MF or SS who received ECP treatment were collected. ECP consisted of a two-session cycle every two to four weeks. In our group we did not carry out prophylactic interruption of the therapy, once started. In patients with stable disease (SD) or partial response (PR), ECP was administered every 4 weeks, until a 6-week maximum interval was reached, and the response maintained. During the study period, the frequency of treatments was decreased, especially for patients with severe comorbidities and/or older age. The associated therapy was considered individually, depending on the extension of the disease, comorbidities, and adverse effects of each agent. Results: 16 patients with cutaneous lymphoma received ECP (9 (56%) with SS and 7 (44%) with MF). Their median age at diagnosis was 63 (57–67) years. The median number of treatments before ECP was 2 (1–3), which was typically either phototherapy or systemic corticosteroids. Regarding the associated treatment during ECP and pandemic, INF and retinoids were the first-choice treatments. In the MF group 3 patients (2 PR and 1 relapse) required additional therapy with acitretin and topic corticosteroids. In the SS group 5 patients (1 PR, 3 progressive disease and 1 relapse) received concomitant t treatment with INF alfa 2b, bexarotene and electron beam; the relapsed patient underwent mono chemotherapy. Three patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2, all of them were from the SS group, the contagion was outside the hospital environment. Two of the patients who developed COVID infection died. Conclusion: For patients with advanced forms of LCCT, who usually have multiple risk factors for a severe course of SARS-CoV-2 infection therapy. The critical patient subset includes those with advanced disease, who require treatment with polychemotherapy, ECP and checkpoint inhibitors. Treatment decisions should be made on an individual basis. In our experience, the continuous use of ECP during the pandemic did not increase the risk of contagion.","Baquero Rey, Jenny Andrea; Granara, Martina; Mazzuoccolo, Luis Daniel; Enz, Paula Andrea",European Journal of Cancer,331,20

Medical teams lack sufficient data to assist determining whether or not to conduct tracheostomy, its short- and long-term implications are not fully understood. This study aims to shed light on the critically ill COVID-19 patients that require tracheostomy, and to investigate its value. METHODS: A retrospective multicentral case-control study of 157 hospitalized critically ill COVID-19 patients, among whom 30 patients went through tracheostomy and consisted of our study group. RESULTS: The mean age was similar between study and control groups (68.9 ± 12.7 years vs 70.5 ± 15.8 years, p = 0.57), as well as comorbidity prevalence (56.7% vs 67.7%, p = 0.25). Patients in the study group were hospitalized for longer duration until defined critically ill (5 ± 4.3 vs 3 ± 3.9 days; p = 0.01), until admitted to the intensive care unit (6 ± 6.6 vs 2.5 ± 3.7 days respectively; p = 0.005), and until discharged (24 ± 9.7 vs 10.7 ± 9.1 days, p < 0.001). Mortality rate was lower in the study group (30% vs 59.8%, p = 0.003). Kaplan Meier survival analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in survival time between groups (Log rank chi-sq = 20.91, p < 0.001) with mean survival time of 41 ± 3.1 days vs 21 ± 2.2 days. Survival was significantly longer in the study group (OR = 0.37, p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: Tracheostomy allows for more prolonged survival for gradually deteriorating critically ill COVID-19 patients. This should be integrated into the medical teams' considerations when debating whether or not to conduct tracheostomy.","Rozenblat, Tal; Reifen, Ella; Benov, Avi; Shaul, Chanan; Neuman, Uri; Karol, Dana; Schvartz, Reut; Bachar, Gideon",Am J Otolaryngol,331,26

The first cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, caused by the contamination of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and quickly turned into a pandemic. In Brazil, the first case occurred on January 23rd, 2020 but was officially reported by the Brazilian Ministry of Health on February 25th. Since then, the number of deaths and people infected by COVID-19 in Brazil have been steadily increasing. Despite the underreporting of coronavirus cases by government agencies across the country, the State of Sao Paulo has the highest rate among all Brazilian States. Thus, it is essential to detect which areas contain the highest concentration of COVID-19 to implement public policies, to mitigate the spread of the epidemic. To identify these critical areas, we utilized daily confirmed case data from the Brasil.IO website between February 25th, 2020 to May 5th, 2020; which were aggregated to the municipality level. A prospective space-time scan statistic was applied to evaluate possible active clusters in three different time periods. The results visualize the space-time evolution and dynamics of COVID-19 clusters in the State of Sao Paulo. Since the first study period, the results highlight approximately 4.6 times the number of municipalities belonging to a significant cluster with a RR>1 on May 5th. These results can inform health authorities and public management to take the necessary measures to minimize the transmission of COVID-19 and track the evolution of significant space-time clusters.","Ferreira, Ricardo Vicente; Martines, Marcos R; Toppa, Rogerio H; Assuncao, Luiza M; Desjardins, Michael Richard; Delmelle, Eric M",,331,16

Here we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic diseases. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus and preprint database up to 29th August 2020, for publications with confirmed COVID-19 infection in patients with rheumatic diseases. The primary outcomes were the rates of hospitalization, oxygen support, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. A meta-analysis of effect sizes using the random-effects models was performed, and meta-regression analyses were performed to explore heterogeneity. The data from the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance physician registry (the COVID-19 GRA) was used as a reference. RESULTS: A total of 31 articles involving 1138 patients were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The publications were from Europe, Asia and North America, but none from other continents. The overall rates of hospitalization, oxygen support, ICU admission and fatality among COVID-19 infected patients with rheumatic diseases were 0.58 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48–0.67), 0.33 (95% CI 0.21–0.47), 0.09 (95% CI 0.05–0.15) and 0.07 (95% CI 0.03–0.11), respectively. The rate of oxygen support in Europe (0.48, 95% CI 0.4–0.57) was higher than that in other continents. Among all hospitalized patients, the rates of oxygen support, ICU admission and fatality were 0.61 (95% CI 0.48–0.73), 0.13 (95% CI 0.07–0.21) and 0.13 (95% CI 0.09–0.18), respectively. The fatality rate was highest in Europe (0.19, 95% CI 0.15–0.24). The fatality rate was higher both in this meta-analysis and the COVID-19 GRA (7.0% and 6.7%, respectively) than that (3.4%) in WHO database, although the age, gender and comorbidity were not matched. CONCLUSION: Patients with rheumatic diseases remain vulnerable with substantial rates of severe outcomes and a geographic variation.

Leveraging upon the diverse gas sensing kinetics behaviors measured via the sensor array, a computational intelligence- based meta-model is proposed to automatically conduct the feature extraction and subsequent gas identification using time-series data during the transitional phase before reaching equilibrium. The time-series data contains implicit temporal dependency/correlation that is worth being characterized to enhance the gas identification performance and reliability. In this context, a tailored approach so-called convolutional long short-term memory (CLSTM) neural network is developed to perform the identification task incorporating temporal characteristics within time-series data. This novel approach shows the enhanced accuracy and robustness as compared to the baseline models, i.e., multilayer perceptron (MLP) and support vector machine (SVM) through the comprehensive statistical examination. Specifically, the classification accuracy of CLSTM reaches as high as 96%, regardless of the operating condition specified. More importantly, the excellent gas identification performance of CLSTM at early stages of gas exposure indicates its practical significance in future real-time applications. The promise of the proposed method has been clearly illustrated through both the internal and external validations in the systematic case investigation.","Zhou, Kai; Liu, Yixin",Sensors (Basel),331,1

We have analyzed the available data for China and Italy. The evolution in time of the number of cumulative diagnosed positive cases of Covid-19 in China very well approximates a distribution of the type of the Error Function, that is, the integral of a normal, Gaussian distribution. We have then used such a function to study the potential evolution in time of the number of positive cases in Italy by performing a number of fits of the official data so far available. We then found a statistical prediction for the day in which the peak of the number of daily positive cases in Italy occurs, corresponding to the flex of the fit, i.e., to the change in sign of its second derivative (that is the change from acceleration to deceleration) as well as of the day in which a substantial attenuation of such number of daily cases is reached. We have then performed 150 Monte Carlo simulations in the attempt to have a more robust prediction of the day of the above-mentioned peak and of the day of the substantial decrease of the number of daily positive cases. Although, official data have been used, these predictions are obtained with a heuristic approach, since those predictions are based on statistical approach and do not take into account either a number of relevant issues (such as medical, social distancing, virologic, epidemiological, etc.) or models of contamination diffusion.","Ciufolini, Ignazio; Paolozzi, Antonio",,331,7

Assessment of the ability of sera from vaccine recipients to neutralise SARS-CoV-2 variants will inform the success of strategies for minimising COVID19 cases and the design of effective antigenic formulations. Here, we examine the sensitivity of variants of concern (VOCs) representative of the B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 (first associated with infections in India) and B.1.351 (first associated with infection in South Africa) lineages of SARS-CoV-2 to neutralisation by sera from individuals vaccinated with the BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) and ChAdOx1 (Oxford/AstraZeneca) vaccines. Across all vaccinated individuals, the spike glycoproteins from B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 conferred reductions in neutralisation of 4.31 and 5.11-fold respectively. The reduction seen with the B.1.617.2 lineage approached that conferred by the glycoprotein from B.1.351 (South African) variant (6.29-fold reduction) that is known to be associated with reduced vaccine efficacy. Neutralising antibody titres elicited by vaccination with two doses of BNT162b2 were significantly higher than those elicited by vaccination with two doses of ChAdOx1. Fold decreases in the magnitude of neutralisation titre following two doses of BNT162b2, conferred reductions in titre of 7.77, 11.30 and 9.56-fold respectively to B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2 and B.1.351 pseudoviruses, the reduction in neutralisation of the delta variant B.1.617.2 surpassing that of B.1.1351. Fold changes in those vaccinated with two doses of ChAdOx1 were 0.69, 4.01 and 1.48 respectively. The accumulation of mutations in these VOCs, and others, demonstrate the quantifiable risk of antigenic drift and subsequent reduction in vaccine efficacy. Accordingly, booster vaccines based on updated variants are likely to be required over time to prevent productive infection. This study also suggests that two dose regimes of vaccine are required for maximal BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1-induced immunity.","Davis, C.; Logan, N.; Tyson, G.; Orton, R.; Harvey, W.; Haughney, J.; Perkins, J.; The COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium,; Peacock, T.; Barclay, W.

Several philosophers have advanced epistemic reasons for using the policy in certain cases. Here we introduce epistemic considerations against no-platforming that are relevant for the reflection on the cases at issue. We then contend that three recent epistemic arguments in favor of no-platforming fail to factor these considerations in and, as a result, offer neither a conclusive justification nor strong epistemic support for no-platforming in any of the relevant cases. Moreover, we argue that, taken together, our epistemic considerations against no-platforming and the three arguments for the policy suggest that no-platforming poses an epistemic dilemma (i.e., a difficult choice situation involving two equally undesirable options). While advocates and opponents of no-platforming alike have so far overlooked this dilemma, it should be addressed not only to prevent that actual no-platforming decisions create more epistemic harm than good, but also to put us into a better position to justify the policy when it is indeed warranted.","Peters, Uwe; Nottelmann, Nikolaj",Synthese,331,16

Here, we show that two types of neurons from distinct brain regions exhibited differential permissivity to replication of several positive-stranded RNA viruses. Granule cell neurons (GCN) of the cerebellum and cortical neurons (CN) from the cerebral cortex have unique innate immune programs that confer differential susceptibility to viral infection ex vivo and in vivo. By transducing CN with genes that were expressed more highly in GCN, we identified three interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs; Ifi27, Irg1, and Rsad2/Viperin) that mediated antiviral effects against different neurotropic viruses. Moreover, we found that the epigenetic state and microRNA-mediated regulation of ISGs correlates with enhanced antiviral response in GCN. Thus, neurons from evolutionarily distinct brain regions have unique innate immune signatures, which likely contribute to their relative permissiveness to infection.","Cho, Hyelim; Proll, Sean C.; Szretter, Kristy J.; Katze, Michael G.; Gale, Michael; Diamond, Michael S.",Nat Med,331,16

The pandemic has led to a rush to repurpose existing drugs, although the underlying evidence base is of variable quality. The improving knowledge of the virology and clinical presentation of COVID-19 is leading to a broadening pool of potential pharmacological targets. The aim of this review is to describe regulatory and pharmacological aspects of drug repurposing and to identify drugs proposed for repurposing in COVID-19 based on registered clinical trials, discussing the evidence to support their use in the treatment of this disease. The challenges of the correct interpretation of existing pre-clinical/clinical evidence as well as the generation of new evidence concerning drug repurposing in COVID-19 will also be discussed.

High-throughput sequencing (HTS) technology gives millions or even billions of sequence reads per run, allowing a comprehensive survey of the genetic content within a sample without prior nucleic acid amplification. In this study, we screened 156 rectal swab samples from apparently healthy bats (n = 96), pigs (n = 9), cattles (n = 9), stray dogs (n = 11), stray cats (n = 11) and monkeys (n = 20) using a HTS metagenomics approach. The complete genome of a novel papillomavirus (PV), Miniopterus schreibersii papillomavirus type 1 (MscPV1), with L1 of 60% nucleotide identity to Canine papillomavirus (CPV6), was identified in a specimen from a Common Bent-wing Bat (M. schreibersii). It is about 7.5kb in length, with a G+C content of 45.8% and a genomic organization similar to that of other PVs. Despite the higher nucleotide identity between the genomes of MscPV1 and CPV6, maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis of the L1 gene sequence showed that MscPV1 and Erethizon dorsatum papillomavirus (EdPV1) are most closely related. Estimated divergence time of MscPV1 from the EdPV1/MscPV1 common ancestor was approximately 60.2–91.9 millions of years ago, inferred under strict clocks using the L1 and E1 genes. The estimates were limited by the lack of reliable calibration points from co-divergence because of possible host shifts. As the nucleotide sequence of this virus only showed limited similarity with that of related animal PVs, the conventional approach of PCR using consensus primers would be unlikely to have detected the novel virus in the sample. Unlike the first bat papillomavirus RaPV1, MscPV1 was found in an asymptomatic bat with no apparent mucosal or skin lesions whereas RaPV1 was detected in the basosquamous carcinoma of a fruit bat Rousettus aegyptiacus. We propose MscPV1 as the first member of the novel Dyolambda-papillomavirus genus.","Tse, Herman; Tsang, Alan K. L.; Tsoi, Hoi-Wah; Leung, Andy S. P.; Ho, Chi-Chun; Lau, Susanna K.

Identification of individual-level susceptibility factors may help people in identifying and managing their emotional, psychological, and social well-being. OBJECTIVE: This study is focused on learning a ranked list of factors that could indicate a predisposition to a mental disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this study, we have used a survey of 17,764 adults in the United States from different age groups, genders, and socioeconomic statuses. Through initial statistical analysis and Bayesian network inference, we have identified key factors affecting mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Integrating Bayesian networks with classical machine learning approaches led to effective modeling of the level of mental health prevalence. RESULTS: Overall, females were more stressed than males, and people in the age group 18-29 years were more vulnerable to anxiety than other age groups. Using the Bayesian network model, we found that people with a chronic mental illness were more prone to mental disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. The new realities of working from home; homeschooling; and lack of communication with family, friends, and neighbors induces mental pressure. Financial assistance from social security helps in reducing mental stress during the COVID-19–generated economic crises. Finally, using supervised machine learning models, we predicted the most mentally vulnerable people with ~80% accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors such as social isolation, digital communication, and working and schooling from home were identified as factors of mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regular in-person communication with friends and family, a healthy social life, and social security were key factors, and taking care of people with a history of mental disease appears to be even more important during this time.","Jha, Indra Prakash; Awasthi, Raghav; Kumar, Ajit; Kumar, Vibhor; Sethi, Tavpritesh",JMIR Ment Health,331,1

Measurement of the magnitude of eye recession, duration of skin tenting in the lateral neck region, and urine specific gravity by refractometry provide the best estimates of hydration status in calves and cattle. Intravenous and oral electrolyte solutions (OES) are frequently administered to critically ill calves and adult cattle. Application of physicochemical principles indicates that 0.9% NaCl, Ringer's solution, and 5% dextrose are equally acidifying, lactated Ringer's and acetated Ringer's solution are neutral to mildly acidifying, and 1.3–1.4% sodium bicarbonate solutions are strongly alkalinizing in cattle. Four different crystalloid solutions are recommended for intravenous fluid therapy in dehydrated or septic calves and dehydrated adult cattle: (1) lactated Ringer's solution and acetated Ringer's solution for dehydrated calves, although neither solution is optimized for administration to neonatal calves or adult cattle; (2) isotonic (1.3%) or hypertonic (5.0 or 8.4%) solutions of sodium bicarbonate for the treatment of calves with diarrhea and severe strong ion (metabolic) acidosis and hyponatremia, and adult cattle with acute ruminal acidosis; (3) Ringer's solution for the treatment of metabolic alkalosis in dehydrated adult cattle, particularly lactating dairy cattle; and (4) hypertonic NaCl solutions (7.2%) and an oral electrolyte solution or water load for the rapid resuscitation of dehydrated neonatal calves and adult cattle. Much progress has been made since the 1970's in identifying important attributes of an OES for diarrheic calves. Important components of an OES for neonatal calves are osmolality, sodium concentration, the effective SID that reflects the concentration of alkalinizing agents, and the energy content. The last three factors are intimately tied to the OES osmolality and the abomasal emptying rate, and therefore the rate of sodium delivery to the small intestine and ultimately the rate of resuscitation. An important need in fluid and electrolyte therapy for adult ruminants is formulation of a practical, effective, and inexpensive OES.","Constable, Peter D.; Trefz, Florian M.; Sen, Ismail; Berchtold, Joachim; Nouri, Mohammad; Smith, Geoffrey; Grünberg, Walter",Front Vet Sci,331,10

Air pollution also causes excess mortality from these conditions. Analysis of the first severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) outcomes in 2003, and preliminary investigations of those for SARS-CoV-2 since 2019, provide evidence that the incidence and severity are related to ambient air pollution. We estimated the fraction of COVID-19 mortality that is attributable to the long-term exposure to ambient fine particulate air pollution. METHODS AND RESULTS: We characterized global exposure to fine particulates based on satellite data, and calculated the anthropogenic fraction with an atmospheric chemistry model. The degree to which air pollution influences COVID-19 mortality was derived from epidemiological data in the USA and China. We estimate that particulate air pollution contributed ∼15% (95% confidence interval 7–33%) to COVID-19 mortality worldwide, 27% (13 – 46%) in East Asia, 19% (8–41%) in Europe, and 17% (6–39%) in North America. Globally, ∼50–60% of the attributable, anthropogenic fraction is related to fossil fuel use, up to 70–80% in Europe, West Asia, and North America. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that air pollution is an important cofactor increasing the risk of mortality from COVID-19. This provides extra motivation for combining ambitious policies to reduce air pollution with measures to control the transmission of COVID-19.","Pozzer, Andrea; Dominici, Francesca; Haines, Andy; Witt, Christian; Münzel, Thomas; Lelieveld, Jos",Cardiovasc Res,331,24

By May, 10 2020 it caused more than 280.000 deaths all over the world. Preliminary data reported a high prevalence of CoV‐2 infection and mortality due to severe acute respiratory syndrome‐related to CoV‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) in kidney transplanted patients (KTRs). Nevertheless, the outcomes and the best treatments for SARS‐CoV‐2 affected KTRs remain unclear. METHODS: In this report we describe the clinical data, the treatments and the outcomes of 5 KTRs with SARS‐CoV‐2 admitted to our hospital in Ancona, Marche region, Italy, from March, 17 to present. Due to the severity of SARS‐CoV‐2, immunosuppression with calcineurin inhibitors, antimetabolites and mTOR‐inhibitors were stopped at the admission. All KTRs were treated with low‐dose steroids. 4/5 KTRs were treated with hydroxychloroquine. All KTRs received tocilizumab up to one dose. RESULTS: Overall, the incidence of SARS‐CoV‐2 in KTRs in the Marche region was 0.85%. 3/5 were admitted in ICU and intubated. One developed AKI with the need of CRRT with Cytosorb. At present 2 patients died, 2 patients were discharged and one is still inpatient in ICU. CONCLUSIONS: The critical evaluation of all cases suggests that the timing of the administration of tocilizumab, an interleukin‐6 receptor antagonist, could be associated with a better efficacy when administered in concomitance to the drop of the oxygen saturation. Thus, in SARS‐CoV‐2 affected KTRs a close biochemical and clinical monitoring should be set up to allow physicians to hit the virus in the right moment such as a sudden reduction of the oxygen saturation and/or a significant increase of the laboratory values such as D‐Dimer.","Maritati, Federica; Cerutti, Elisabetta; Zuccatosta, Lina; Fiorentini, Alessandro; Finale, Carolina; Ficosecco, Marta; Cristiano, Fabrizio; Capestro, Alessandro; Balestra, Emilio; Taruscia, Domenica; Vivarelli, Marco; Donati, Abele; Perna, Gian Piero; Giacometti, Andrea; Tavio, Marcello; Onesta, Maicol; Di Sante, Laura; Ranghino, Andrea",Transpl Infect Dis,331,17

International experts recommend considering delaying or stopping AML treatment, test patients who need intensive induction and s prioritizing outpatient treatment. However there is little published evidence in AML. Objective To analyze the clinical futures and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in AML patients. Methods and patients Observational multicenter study between March and May 2020; 117 patients reported from 47 Spanish centers, but 13 had no PCR or antibody test documented, finally including 104 patients from 45 hospitals. Results The median age was 68 years, men (56.7% vs 43.3%), and the median time from AML diagnosis to SARS-CoV-2 was 4 months. The mean of comorbidities was 1.2, high blood pressure (40.4%), heart disease (17.3%), diabetes (13.5%), smoking (8.8%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or emphysema (7.7%), renal failure (6.7%) and liver dysfunction (1.9%). Cytogenetic risk was low in 16.9%, intermediate in 57.1% and high in 26.0%; 55.7% had active disease, 39.2% complete remission and 5.1% partial response. 29.4% were off-therapy and 70.6% under antileukemic treatment at the time of SARS-CoV-2: induction chemotherapy (25.3%), hypomethylating (19.3%), clinical trial (17.0%), consolidation chemotherapy (14.8%), venetoclax (3.4%), FLT3 inhibitors (3.4%) and/or maintenance (1.1%). Overall 3.7% were newly diagnosed (no prior therapy), 77.8% had received one line of treatment, 14.8% two and 3.7% four. 15.4% had prior allogeneic transplantation. Only 4.0% of the patients were asymptomatic, while the main signs and symptoms were fever (77.8%), pneumonia (75.0%), cough (65.3%), dyspnea (52.0%), diarrhea (20.4%), nausea and/or vomiting (12.2%), rhinorrhea (10.2%) and headache (7.4%). Analytical parameters were: neutrophils 3112 cells/µL (1900-7300), lymphocytes 1090 cells/µL (1000-3000), interleukin 6 118 pg/mL (0-100), ferritin 4505 ng/mL (15-150) and D-dimer 2823 ng/mL (20-500), with liver enzymes altered in 23.9% of cases. 84.2% received specific treatment for coronavirus infection: chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (82.2%), lopinavir/ritonavir (54.0%), corticosteroids (39.6%), azithromycin (33.0%), tocilizumab (15.8%), plasma convalescent (3.0%), clinical trial medication (3.0%), remdesivir (2.0%) and/or anakinra (1.0%). The course was mild in 14.7% (no hospitalization), moderate in 32.0% and severe in 53.3%. The implementation of intensive measures was assessed in 48.2%(14.9% admitted to the ICU and the remaining 33.3% rejected). The mean time to negativization was 20.5 days, duration of symptoms 17.6 days and the hospital stay 11.1 days. In 48.1% of the cases treatment for AML was maintained, in 26.6% delayed and in 25.3% modified due to coronavirus disease.47.5% died, establishing an association between mortality and age over 60 years (58.3% vs 36.4%, p=0.043), ≥2 lines of treatment (72.7% vs 44.3%, p=0.020), active disease (62.5% vs 29.4%, p=0.002) and pneumonia (61.2% versus 22.7%, p=0.002). Overall 47.5% overcame the infection, and in 5.0% SARS-CoV-2 genetic material was still detected at the time of analysis. A non-significant lower mortality rate was observed among: previous transplantation (45.7% vs 64.3%, p=0.19), neutrophil >1900 cells/µL (41.1% vs 60.0%, p=0.09), lymphocyte >1000 cells/µL (42.9% vs 63.6%, p = 0.09) and hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine plus azithromycin (35.3% vs 60.0%, p=0.10).

Methods A retrospective review of outpatient records at a single children’s hospital from March 21 to April 10, 2020, was carried out to determine the outcome of already-scheduled face-to-face outpatient appointments. The week leading up to the March 21, all appointments in the study period were categorized as follows: (1) requiring an in-person visit, (2) face-to-face visit that could be postponed, and (3) consultation required but could be virtual. Teams of administrators, schedulers, and ophthalmic technicians used defined scripts and standardized emails to communicate results of categorization to patients. Flowcharts were devised to schedule and implement telemedicine visits. Informational videos were made accessible on social media to prepare patients for the telemedicine experience. Simultaneously our children’s hospital launched a pediatric on-demand e-consult service, the data analytics of which could be used to determine how many visits were eye related. Results A total of 237 virtual ophthalmology consult visits were offered during the study period: 212 were scheduled, and 206 were completed, of which 43 were with new patients and 163 with returning patients. Following the initial virtual visit, another was required on average in 4 weeks by 21 patients; in-person follow-up was required for 170 patients on average 4.6 months after the initial virtual visit. None needed review within 72 hours. The pediatric on-demand service completed 290 visits, of which 25 had eye complaints. Conclusions With proper materials, technology, and staffing, a telemedicine strategy based on three patient categories can be rapidly implemented to provide continued patient care during pandemic conditions. In our study cohort, the scheduled clinic e-visits had a low no-show rate (3%), and 8% of the on-demand virtual access for pediatric care was eye related.","Kapoor, Saloni; Eldib, Amgad; Hiasat, Jamila; Scanga, Hannah; Tomasello, Jennifer; Alabek, Michelle; Ament, Kellie; Arner, Debbi; Benson, Ashley; Berret, Kristine; Blaha, Bianca; Brinza, Melissa; Caterino, Roxanne; Chauhan, Baresh; Churchfield, Whitney; Fulwylie, Christina; Gruszewski, Jessi; Hrinak, Denise; Johnston, Lori; Meyer, Cheryl; Nanda, Kaajal; Newton, Teresa; Pomycala, Becci; Runkel, Lauren; Sanchez, Katherine; Skellett, Sarah; Steigerwald, Jess; Mitchell, Ellen; Pihlblad, Matthew; Luchansky, Craig; Keim, Erin; Yu, Jenny; Quinn, Patrick; Mittal, Anshul; Pitetti, Raymond; Patil-Chhablani, Preeti; Liasis, Alkiviadis; Nischal, Ken K.",J AAPOS,331,21

METHODS: 316 patients with UTUC who underwent radical surgery at a high-volume center in China between January 2008 and December 2019 were included in this study. We retrospectively collected the clinicopathologic data from the medical records, including age, sex, smoking history, ECOG performance status (ECOG PS), body mass index (BMI), tumor location and size, number of lesions, T stage, N stage, surgical approach and occurrence of hydronephrosis, lymph node invasion, lymph node dissection, surgical margin, tumor necrosis, infiltrative tumor architecture, lymphovascular invasion and concomitant bladder cancer. Surgical wait time was defined as the interval between initial imaging diagnosis and radical surgery of UTUC. Hydronephrosis was defined as abnormal dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces due to obstruction of the urinary system. Firstly, all patients were divided into short-wait (<31 days), intermediate-wait (31-90 days) and long-wait (>90 days) groups according to the surgical wait time. The clinicopathological characteristics of each group were evaluated and the survival was compared. For patients with hydronephrosis, we subsequently divided them into two groups: short-wait (≤60 days) and long-wait (>60 days) groups according to the surgical wait time. Univariate and multivariate COX regression analysis were performed to evaluate the prognostic risk factor for patients with hydronephrosis. RESULTS: A total of 316 patients with UTUC were included in this study with a median surgical wait time of 22 days (IQR 11-71 days). Of the 316 patients, 173 were classified into the short-wait group (54.7%), 69 into the intermediate-wait group (21.8%) and 74 into the long-wait group (23.5%). The median follow-up time for all patients was 43 months (IQR 28-67months). The median surgical wait times of the short-wait, intermediate-wait and long-wait group were12 days (IQR 8-17days), 42days (IQR 37-65days) and 191days (IQR 129-372days), respectively. The 5-year overall survival (OS) of all patients was 54.3%. The 5-year OS of short-wait, intermediate-wait and long-wait groups were 56.4%, 59.3% and 35.1%, respectively (P=0.045). The 5-year cancer-specific survival (CSS) of short-wait, intermediate-wait and long-wait groups were 65.8%, 70.9% and 39.6%, respectively (P=0.032). In the subgroup analysis, we divided 158 UTUC patients with hydronephrosis into short-wait group (≤60 days) and long-wait group (> 60 days), 120 patients were included in the short-wait group and 38 patients in the long-wait group. The median surgical wait times of the short-wait and long-wait group were 14days (IQR 8-28days) and 174days (IQR 100-369days), respectively. The 5-year OS of long-wait group was significantly lower than the OS of short-wait group (44.2% vs. 55.1%, P =0.023). The 5-year CSS of long-wait and short-wait group were 49.1% and 61.7%, respectively (P=0.041). In multivariate Cox regression analysis of UTUC patients with hydronephrosis, surgical wait time, tumor grade, pathological T stage, and tumor size were independent risk factors for OS and CSS. Lymph node involvement was also a prognostic factor for CSS. CONCLUSION: For patients with UTUC, the surgical wait time should be limited to less than 3 months. For UTUC patients with hydronephrosis, the OS and CSS of patients with surgical wait time of more than 60 days were relatively shorted than those of patients with surgical wait time of less than 60 days.","Zhao, Fangzheng; Qi, Nienie; Zhang, Chu; Xue, Ning; Li, Shuaishuai; Zhou, Raorao; Chen, Zeyu; Yao, Ruiqin; Zhu, Haitao",Front Oncol,331,24

METHODS: In this phase 2, randomized, open-label study, adult subjects aged >18 years with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 with moderate symptoms were randomized in a 1:1 to receive PEG IFN-α2b plus SOC, or SOC alone. The primary endpoint was improvement in clinical status on day 15, measured by WHO 7-point ordinal scale. RESULTS: Total 40 subjects were randomized to PEG IFN-α2b plus SOC (n = 20) and SOC (n = 20). Overall, 19 (95.00%) subjects in PEG IFN-α2b plus SOC had achieved clinical improvement on day 15 compared to 13 (68.42%) subjects in SOC (p < 0.05).

In parallel, LPS was used as an activator. Cells were analyzed for cytokines and surface markers by flow cytometry. High levels of IL‐6 and measurable levels of IL‐8 and TNF, but not IL‐1β, were observed in COVID‐19 patients. Monocytes from COVID‐19 patients had spontaneous production of IL‐1β and IL‐8 (P = 0.0043), but not of TNF and IL‐6, compared to controls. No spontaneous cytokine production was seen in lymphocytes from either patients or controls. Activation with LPS resulted in massive cytokine production by monocytes from COVID‐19 patients and healthy controls, but not from sepsis patients. Finally, monocytes from COVID‐19 patients produced more IL‐1β than from healthy controls (P = 0.0087) when activated. In conclusion, monocytes contribute partly to the ongoing hyperinflammation by production of IL‐1β and IL‐8. Additionally, they are responsive to further activation. This data supports the notion of IL‐1β blockade in treatment of COVID‐19. However, the source of the high levels of IL‐6 remains to be determined.","Kahn, Robin; Schmidt, Tobias; Golestani, Karan; Mossberg, Anki; Gullstrand, Birgitta; Bengtsson, Anders A.; Kahn, Fredrik",J Leukoc Biol,331,1

Cross-sectional data indicate that anxiety and depression levels are greater during the pandemic, yet no known prospective studies have tested this assertion. Further, individuals with elevated trait anxiety prior to a global pandemic may theoretically be more apt to experience greater pandemic-related anxiety and/or impairment. The current study tested whether anxiety and depression increased from the month before the state's Stay-At-Home order to the period of the Stay-At-Home order among 120 young adults in Louisiana, a state with especially high rates of COVID-19 related infections and deaths. We also tested whether pre-pandemic social anxiety was related to greater pandemic related anxiety, depression, and COVID-related worry and impairment. Depression but not anxiety increased during the Stay-At-Home order. Further, pre-pandemic trait anxiety, social anxiety, and depression were statistically significant predictors of anxiety and depression during the Stay-At-Home order, although only social anxiety was robustly related to COVID-related worry and impairment. Emotional distress increased during the COVID-19 pandemic Stay-At-Home order and this is especially the case among individuals with pre-pandemic elevations in trait anxiety (especially social anxiety) and depression.","Buckner, Julia D.; Abarno, Cristina N.; Lewis, Elizabeth M.; Zvolensky, Michael J.; Garey, Lorra",Psychiatry Res,331,2

Hence, there is significant need for the ability to provide patient-specific MV settings to ensure safety, and optimise patient care. Model-based approaches enable patient-specific care by identifying time-varying patient-specific parameters, such as respiratory elastance, E(rs), to capture inter- and intra-patient variability. However, patient-specific parameters evolve with time, as a function of disease progression and patient condition, making predicting their future values crucial for recommending patient-specific MV settings. This study employs stochastic modelling to predict future E(rs) values using retrospective patient data to develop and validate a model indicating future intra-patient variability of E(rs). Cross validation results show stochastic modelling can predict future elastance ranges with 92.59 and 68.56% of predicted values within the 5–95% and the 25–75% range, respectively. This range can be used to ensure patients receive adequate minute ventilation should elastance rise and minimise the risk of VILI should elastance fall. The results show the potential for model-based protocols using stochastic model prediction of future E(rs) values to provide safe and patient-specific MV. These results warrant further investigation to validate its clinical utility.","Lee, Jay Wing Wai; Chiew, Yeong Shiong; Wang, Xin; Tan, Chee Pin; Mat Nor, Mohd Basri; Damanhuri, Nor Salwa; Chase, J.

The National COVID Cohort Collaborative was developed to facilitate analysis of patient-level data for those tested for COVID-19 across the United States. METHODS. In this study, we identified a cohort of SOT recipients testing positive or negative for COVID-19 (COVID+ and COVID−, respectively) between January 1, 2020, and November 20, 2020. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were used to determine predictors of a positive result among those tested. Outcomes following COVID-19 diagnosis were also explored. RESULTS. Of 18 121 SOT patients tested, 1925 were positive (10.6%). COVID+ SOT patients were more likely to have a kidney transplant and be non-White race. Comorbidities were common in all SOT patients but significantly more common in those who were COVID+. Of COVID+ SOT, 42.9% required hospital admission. COVID+ status was the strongest predictor of acute kidney injury (AKI), rejection, and graft failure in the 90 d after testing. A total of 40.9% of COVID+ SOT experienced a major adverse renal or cardiac event, 16.3% experienced a major adverse cardiac event, 35.3% experienced AKI, and 1.5% experienced graft loss. CONCLUSIONS. In the largest US cohort of COVID+ SOT recipients to date, we identified patient factors associated with the diagnosis of COVID-19 and outcomes following infection, including a high incidence of major adverse renal or cardiac event and AKI.","Vinson, Amanda J.; Agarwal, Gaurav; Dai, Ran; Anzalone, Alfred J.; Lee, Stephen B.; French, Evan; Olex, Amy; Madhira, Vithal; Mannon, Roslyn B.",Transplant Direct,331,20

Perioperative big data initiatives were established to monitor treatment quality and benchmark outcomes. However, big data analyses have long exceeded the status of pure quality surveillance instruments. Large retrospective studies nowadays often represent the first approach to new questions in clinical research and pave the way for more expensive and resource intensive prospective trials. As a consequence, the utilization of big data in acute pain and regional anesthesia research has considerably increased over the last decade. Multicentric clinical registries and administrative databases (e.g., healthcare claims databases) have collected millions of cases until today, on which basis several important research questions were approached. In acute pain research, big data was used to assess postoperative pain outcomes, opioid utilization, and the efficiency of multimodal pain management strategies. In regional anesthesia, adverse events and potential benefits of regional anesthesia on postoperative morbidity and mortality were evaluated.

The fear and the constraints imposed to control the pandemic may correspondingly influence leisure activities, such as birding, which is the practice of observing birds based on visual and acoustic cues. Birders are people who carry out birding observations around the globe and contribute to the massive data collection in citizen science projects. Contrasting to earlier COVID-19 studies, which have concentrated on clinical, pathological, and virological topics, this study focused on the behavioral changes of birders. A total of 4484 questionnaire survey responses from 97 countries were received. The questionnaire had an open-ended style. About 85% of respondents reported that COVID-19 has changed their birding behavior. The most significant change in birdwatchers’ behavior was related to the geographic coverage of birding activities, which became more local. People focused mostly on yard birding. In total, 12% of respondents (n = 542 cases) reported having more time for birding, whereas 8% (n = 356 cases) reported having less time for birding. Social interactions decreased since respondents, especially older people, changed their birding behavior toward birding alone or with their spouse. Women reported more often than men that they changed to birding alone or with their spouse, and women also reported more often about canceled fieldtrips or society meetings. Respondents from higher developed countries reported that they spend currently more time for birding, especially for birding alone or with their spouse, and birding at local hotspots. Our study suggests that long lockdowns with strict regulations may severely impact on leisure activities. In addition, a temporal and spatial shift in birding due to the pandemic may influence data quality in citizen science projects. As nature-based recreation will be directed more toward nearby sites, environmental management resources and actions need to be directed to sites that are located near the users, e.g., in urban and suburban areas. The results can be applied with caution to other nature-based recreational activities.","Randler, Christoph; Tryjanowski, Piotr; Jokimäki, Jukka; Kaisanlahti-Jokimäki, Marja-Liisa; Staller, Naomi",Int J Environ Res Public Health,331,26

Particularly, serological testing may allow individuals with low-risk of being contagious of SARS-CoV-2 to return to daily activities. Both private and academic initiatives have sought to develop serological assays to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Herein, we compared five different assays in active healthcare personnel exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in a large center in Madrid, Spain, in a retrospective study. Median time lapse between polymerase chain-reaction (PCR) and serological testing was 11 days (7–21). All tests assessed IgM/IgG titers except for Euroimmun (IgA/IgG) and The Binding-Site (IgA/IgM/IgG). The highest concordance rate was observed between Dia.Pro and Euroimmun (75.76%), while it was lowest between The Binding-Site and Euroimmun (44.55%). The Binding-Site assay showed the highest concordance (85.52%) with PCR results. Considering PCR results as reference, Dia.Pro was the most sensitive test, although The Binding-Site assay exhibited the highest area under the curve (AUC; 0.85). OrientGene and MAGLUMI tests were performed in a smaller cohort with confirmed infection and thus were not adequate to estimate sensitivity and specificity. The Binding-Site assay presented the best joint sensitivity and specificity among all the tests analyzed in our cohort. Likewise, this serological assay presents a greater repertoire of antibodies and antigen-regions tested, which is why each individual’s humoral immunity is more accurately reflected. The better the immunity test, the most adequate the health strategy to take in terms of organization of consultations, surgery, and treatments in vulnerable patients. The three antibody classes (IgG/IgM/IgA) were determined jointly, which translates to an economic impact on healthcare.

Chronic social stress is thought to generate a pro-inflammatory state characterized by elevated antibacterial defenses and reduced investment in antiviral defense. Here, we manipulated long-term social status in female rhesus macaques to show that social subordination alters the gene expression response to ex vivo bacterial and viral challenge. As predicted by current models, bacterial lipopolysaccharide polarizes the immune response such that low status corresponds to higher expression of genes in NF-κB-dependent pro-inflammatory pathways and lower expression of genes involved in the antiviral response and type I interferon (IFN) signaling. Counter to predictions, however, low status drives more exaggerated expression of both NF-κB and IFN-associated genes after cells are exposed to the viral mimic Gardiquimod. Status-driven gene expression patterns are not only linked to social status at the time of sampling, but also to social history (i.e., past social status), especially in unstimulated cells. However, for a subset of genes, we observed interaction effects in which females who fell in rank were more strongly affected by current social status than those who climbed the social hierarchy. Together, our results indicate that the effects of social status on immune cell gene expression depend on pathogen exposure, pathogen type, and social history – in support of social experience-mediated biological embedding in adulthood, even in the conventionally memory-less innate immune system.","Sanz, Joaquin; Maurizio, Paul L.; Snyder-Mackler, Noah; Simons, Noah D.; Voyles, Tawni; Kohn, Jordan; Michopoulos, Vasiliki; Wilson, Mark; Tung, Jenny; Barreiro, Luis B.",bioRxiv,331,5

METHODS: We surveyed PD patients who reported COVID-19 to their Movement Disorders specialists at Columbia University Irving Medical Center and respondents from an online survey administered by the Parkinson’s Foundation that assessed COVID-19 symptoms, general clinical outcomes and changes in motor and non-motor PD symptoms. RESULTS: Forty-six participants with PD and COVID-19 were enrolled. Similar to the general population, the manifestations of COVID-19 among people with PD were heterogeneous ranging from asymptomatic carriers (1/46) to death (6/46). The most commonly reported COVID-19 symptoms were fever/chills, fatigue, cough, weight loss, and muscle pain. Worsening and new onset of motor and non-motor PD symptoms during COVID-19 illness were also reported, including dyskinesia, rigidity, balance disturbances, anxiety, depression, and insomnia. CONCLUSION: We did not find sufficient evidence that PD is an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 and death. Larger studies with controls are required to understand this further.

Patients who presented with delirium may have a higher morbidity and mortality rate due to older age, other comorbidities, and atypical COVID-19 presentation. Currently, the evidence supporting delirium as one of the predictors of poor outcome of COVID-19 is still insufficient. This study aims to explore the potential association between delirium and poor outcomes from COVID-19. METHODS: We systematically searched the PubMed and Google Scholar databases using specific keywords related to our aims until January 30th, 2021. All articles published on COVID-19 and delirium were retrieved. The quality of the study was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) tool for observational studies and Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Tools for case-series studies. Statistical analysis was done using Review Manager 5.4 software. RESULTS: Our meta-analysis of 20 studies showed that delirium symptoms on admission was associated with poor outcomes from COVID-19 [OR 2.36 (95% CI 1.80–3.09), p < 0.00001, I(2) = 76%, random-effect models] and its subgroup which consist of severe COVID-19 [OR 3.89 (95% CI 1.72–8.75), p = 0.001, I(2) = 91%, random-effect models], and mortality from COVID-19 [OR 1.90 (95% CI 1.55–2.33), p < 0.00001, I(2) = 36%, random-effect models]. Meta-regression showed that the association was influenced by age (p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests delirium as an important marker to identify patients at higher risk for developing poor COVID-19 outcomes. The physicians should add delirium as one of the common presenting symptoms of COVID-19 in older populations.","Hariyanto, Timotius Ivan; Putri, Cynthia; Hananto, Joshua Edward; Arisa, Jessie; Fransisca V Situmeang, Rocksy; Kurniawan, Andree",J Psychiatr Res,331,16

It is believed that Th17 cells also play a central role in the induction of autoimmune diseases. Recent advances have evaluated Th17 effector functions during viral infections, including their critical role in the production and induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and in the recruitment and activation of other immune cells. Thus, Th17 is involved in the induction both of pathogenicity and immunoprotective mechanisms seen in the host’s immune response against viruses. However, certain Th17 cells can also modulate immune responses, since they can secrete immunosuppressive factors, such as IL-10; these cells are called non-pathogenic Th17 cells. Here, we present a brief review of Th17 cells and highlight their involvement in some virus infections. We cover these notions by highlighting the role of Th17 cells in regulating the protective and pathogenic immune response in the context of viral infections. In addition, we will be describing myocarditis and multiple sclerosis as examples of immune diseases triggered by viral infections, in which we will discuss further the roles of Th17 cells in the induction of tissue damage.","Paiva, Iury Amancio; Badolato-Corrêa, Jéssica; Familiar-Macedo, Débora; de-Oliveira-Pinto, Luzia Maria",Cells,331,1

RESULTS: Male customers were more likely to purchase e-liquid at the shop than female customers (p < .001). There were no sex differences vaping at the shop (p = .353). We observed more customers vaping at shops with e-cigarette safety displays (p = .024) and more customers purchasing e-liquid at shops with quit smoking signage (p = .004). Point-of-sale displays were not associated with either customer vaping or purchasing behaviors observed at the shop. Displays of state-regulated and nonregulated (i.e., tobacco industry) age-of-sale compliance signs, Ask4ID and WeCard, were not significantly associated with customer vaping or purchase behaviors. CONCLUSION: Certain display signs present at vape shops might communicate to customers that engaging in certain behaviors (e.g., vaping inside the shops) may be safe or acceptable.","Huh, Jimi; Meza, Leah; Galstyan, Ellen; Galimov, Artur; Yu, Sheila; Unger, Jennifer B.; Baezconde-Garbanati, Lourdes; Sussman, Steve",Addict Behav Rep,331,3

Whereas anesthesiologists may be primarily concerned with airway and respiratory management, the COVID-19 data accumulated to date indicate that primary and/or secondary cardiovascular complications are common. Previous studies have demonstrated that the mortality rate is significantly higher in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) than in patients without CVD. Dysregulation of immune function in patients with CVD may be involved in the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Anesthesia and surgical procedures can modulate the immune system, and some patients undergoing surgery, particularly those undergoing cardiovascular procedures, have CVD. In perioperative management for patients with suspected or diagnosed COVID-19 and those who have recovered from COVID-19, it is important for anesthesiologists to be concerned not only with airway and respiratory management, but also with cardiovascular complications and perioperative circulatory management to control the progression of the disease in patients with COVID-19.","Hirata, Naoyuki; Yamakage, Michiaki",J Anesth,331,3

The worldwide epidemiologic data showed higher mortality in males compared to females, suggesting a hypothesis about the protective effect of estrogens against severe disease progression with the ultimate end being patient’s death. This article summarizes the current knowledge regarding the potential effect of estrogens and other modulators of estrogen receptors on COVID-19. While estrogen receptor activation shows complex effects on the patient’s organism, such as an influence on the cardiovascular/pulmonary/immune system which includes lower production of cytokines responsible for the cytokine storm, the receptor-independent effects directly inhibits viral replication. Furthermore, it inhibits the interaction of IL-6 with its receptor complex. Interestingly, in addition to natural hormones, phytestrogens and even synthetic molecules are able to interact with the estrogen receptor and exhibit some anti-COVID-19 activity. From this point of view, estrogen receptor modulators have the potential to be included in the anti-COVID-19 therapeutic arsenal.","Abramenko, Nikita; Vellieux, Fréderic; Tesařová, Petra; Kejík, Zdeněk; Kaplánek, Robert; Lacina, Lukáš; Dvořánková, Barbora; Rösel, Daniel; Brábek, Jan; Tesař, Adam; Jakubek, Milan; Smetana, Karel",Int J Mol Sci,331,9

It is a safe diagnostic tool with low adverse event rates. As with other endoscopic modalities, various colon capsule endoscopy scores allow the standardisation of reporting and reproducibility. As bowel cleanliness affects CCE’s diagnostic yield, a few operator-dependent scores (Leighton–Rex and CC-CLEAR scores) and a computer-dependent score (CAC score) have been developed to grade bowel cleanliness objectively. CCE can be used to monitor IBD mucosal disease activity through the UCEIS and the panenteric CECDAIic score for UC and CD, respectively. CCE may also have a role in CRC screening, given similar sensitivity and specificity rates to conventional colonoscopy to detect colonic polyps ≥ 10 mm and CRC. Given CCE’s diagnostic yield and reproducible clinical scores with high inter-observer agreements, CCE is fast becoming a suitable alternative to conventional colonoscopy in specific patient populations.","Tabone, Trevor; Koulaouzidis, Anastasios; Ellul, Pierre",J Clin Med,331,1

The global circulation and occasional introductions of pandemic H1N1/2009 virus in humans and in pigs, respectively, might provide opportunities for this virus to reassort with other influenza viruses. These possible reassortment events might alter virulence and/or transmissibility of the new reassortants. Investigations that can detect such possible reassortants should therefore be included as a part of pandemic influenza surveillance plans. METHODS: We established a real-time RT-PCR-based strategy for the detection of reassortment of pandemic H1N1/2009 virus. Singleplex SYBR green-based RT-PCR assays specific for each gene segment of pandemic H1N1/2009 were developed. These assays were evaluated by influenza viruses with different genetic backgrounds. RESULTS: All human pandemic H1N1 (N=27) and all seasonal human (N=58) isolates were positive and negative, respectively, for all 8 segments. Of 48 swine influenza viruses isolated from our on-going surveillance program of influenza viruses in swine, 10 were positive in all reactions. All 8 viral segments of these 10 samples were confirmed to be of pandemic H1N1 origin, indicating that these were caused by zoonotic transmissions from human to pigs. The 38 swine viruses that are non-pandemic H1N1/2009 had 1 to 6 gene segments positive in the tests. Further characterization of these non-pandemic H1N1/2009 swine viruses indicated that these PCR positive genes are the precursor genes of pandemic H1N1/2009 virus. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that these assays can detect re-introductions of pandemic H1N1/2009 virus in pigs. These assays might be useful screening tools for identifying viral reassortants derived from pandemic H1N1/2009 or its precursors.","Poon, LLM; Mak, PWY; Li, OTW; Chan, KH; Cheung, CL; Ma, ES; Yen, HL; Vijaykrishna, D; Guan, Y; Peiris, JSM",Clinical Chemistry,331,26

To understand the potential for recognition of different modifications of sialic acid by MVM, three types of capsids, virus-like particles, wild type empty (no DNA) capsids, and DNA packaged virions, were screened on a sialylated glycan microarray (SGM). Both viruses demonstrated a preference for binding to 9-O-methylated sialic acid derivatives, while MVMp showed additional binding to 9-O-acetylated and 9-O-lactoylated sialic acid derivatives, indicating recognition differences. The glycans recognized contained a type-2 Galβ1-4GlcNAc motif (Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc or 3′SIA-LN) and were biantennary complex-type N-glycans with the exception of one. To correlate the recognition of the 3′SIA-LN glycan motif as well as the biantennary structures to their natural expression in cell lines permissive for MVMp, MVMi, or both strains, the N- and O-glycans, and polar glycolipids present in three cell lines used for in vitro studies, A9 fibroblasts, EL4 T lymphocytes, and the SV40 transformed NB324K cells, were analyzed by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. The cells showed an abundance of the sialylated glycan motifs recognized by the viruses in the SGM and previous glycan microarrays supporting their role in cellular recognition by MVM. Significantly, the NB324K showed fucosylation at the non-reducing end of their biantennary glycans, suggesting that recognition of these cells is possibly mediated by the Lewis X motif as in 3′SIA-Le(X) identified in a previous glycan microarray screen.","Halder, Sujata; Cotmore, Susan; Heimburg-Molinaro, Jamie; Smith, David F.; Cummings, Richard D.; Chen, Xi; Trollope, Alana J.; North, Simon J.; Haslam, Stuart M.; Dell, Anne; Tattersall, Peter; McKenna, Robert; Agbandje-McKenna, Mavis",PLoS One,331,20

We report that convalescent-phase sera and vaccine-elicited antibodies retain full neutralizing titer against the S477N B.1.526 variant and neutralize the E484K version with a modest 3.5-fold decrease in titer compared to D614G. The E484K version was neutralized with a 12-fold decrease in titer by the REGN10933 monoclonal antibody, but the combination cocktail with REGN10987 was fully active. The findings suggest that current vaccines and Regeneron therapeutic monoclonal antibodies will remain protective against the B.1.526 variants.

The S protein of SARS-CoV-2, similar to type I fusion proteins of viruses such as HIV-1 envelope (Env) and influenza hemagglutinin, is heavily glycosylated. Viral Env glycans, though host derived, are distinctly processed and thereby recognized or accommodated during antibody responses. In recent years, highly potent and/or broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (bnAbs) that are generated in chronic HIV-1 infections have been defined. These bnAbs exhibit atypical features such as extensive somatic hypermutations, long complementary determining region (CDR) lengths, tyrosine sulfation and presence of insertions/deletions, enabling them to effectively neutralize diverse HIV-1 viruses despite extensive variations within the core epitopes they recognize. As some of the HIV-1 bnAbs have evolved to recognize the dense viral glycans and cross-reactive epitopes (CREs), we assessed if these bnAbs cross-react with SARS-CoV-2. Several HIV-1 bnAbs showed cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 while one HIV-1 CD4 binding site bnAb, N6, neutralized SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, neutralizing plasma antibodies of chronically HIV-1 infected children showed cross neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses.

Mitigation strategies that can be employed to efficiently return to practice and ensuring the highest level of safety to both the patient and the otorhinolaryngologist is emphasised whilst simultaneously adapting to the new normal. Attention was given to understanding of the virus, its effect on the ENT discipline and practice, counter measures to mitigate and minimise risk to allow for continuation of ENT services once restrictions and lockdowns are progressively lifted. Otorhinolaryngological manifestations are common symptoms of COVID-19. Evidence suggests that the highest rates of nosocomial spread were seen amongst otorhinolaryngologists. The COVID-19 pandemic unexpectedly halted a majority of the otorhinolaryngology activities, which impacted service provision in the ENT practice. As the pandemic evolves, and with its duration unpredictable, this may necessitate a fundamental shift in the way otorhinolaryngology is practiced as there may be further global viral pandemics in future and the ENT fraternity has to now adapt to the new normal. Continued vigilance is imperative and strategies optimally implemented to ensure safe return to both ENT specialist clinic services and surgeries is vital. There are currently no uniform best-practice recommendations for otorhinolaryngology in the COVID-19 setting, although key strategies to prevent the virus spread have become evident to be able to effectively ‘flatten the curve’ of COVID-19 infections over time.","Maharaj, Shivesh",S Afr J Infect Dis,331,1

They also describe the safe donning and doffing procedures for this protective gear. MAIN TEXT: Due to the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), the CDC has recommended ways to conserve disposable N95 masks, including re-use and extended use, and reserving N95 masks for aerosol-generating procedures. However, these were never made to be re-used. Although the modes of transmission of COVID-19 are not fully understood, based on what we know about severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), droplets and aerosolized droplets contribute to the spread of this virus. More evidence from Wuhan, China, has demonstrated that COVID-19 viral particles are aerosolized and found in higher concentrations in rooms where PPE is being removed. Thus, it is best for all healthcare providers to have full aerosol protection. CONCLUSION: Given the shortage of PPE for aerosols, it is logical to utilize reusable elastomeric respirators with filter efficiency of 95% or higher. A single elastomeric respirator may replace hundreds to thousands of new disposable N95 masks.","Chiang, James; Hanna, Andrew; Lebowitz, David; Ganti, Latha",Int J Emerg Med,331,1

Of those, 1026 were healthcare workers (HCWs) of whom 292 were directly involved in the care of covid-19 patients. During the study period, infection control interventions were deployed, those included i) strict barrier nursing of all known covid-19 patients including FFP2 (N95) masks, goggles, gloves, hoods and protective gowns, ii) visitor restrictions with access control at all hospital entries, iii) mandatory wearing of disposable face masks in all clinical settings, and iv) universal RT-PCR admission screening of patients. Main Outcome Measures: SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion rate Results: At the initial screening, ten participants displayed significant IgG antibody ratios. Another ten individuals showed seroconversion at the second time point one month later, only two further participants seroconverted during the subsequent two months. The overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in the study cohort at the last follow-up was 1.8%, the seroconversion rate dropped from 0.81% to 0.08% per month despite a longer observation period. Amongst HCWs seropositivity was increased in those directly involved in the care of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections (3.8%, n=11) compared to other HCWs (1.4%, n=10, P=0.025).

In addition to infectious and respiratory disease physicians, many doctors in other medical fields have been infected. Methods We prospectively collected epidemiological data on medical staff members who are working in neurosurgery departments in 107 hospitals in Hubei province through self-reported questionnaires or telephone interviews. Data of medical staff members with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were analysed. The final follow-up date was 1 March 2020. Findings A total of 5,442 neurosurgery department medical staff members were surveyed. One hundred and twenty cases, involving 54 doctors and 66 nurses, were found to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. The overall incidence was 2.2%. These cases were concentrated in 26 centres, 16 of which had admitted a total of 59 patients with COVID-19 complicated by craniocerebral disease. Medical staff members in centres receiving COVID-19 patients had a higher risk of contracting infection than those in centres not receiving COVID-19 patients (relative risk: 19.6; 95% confidence interval: 12.6-30.6). Contact with either COVID-19 patients (62.5%, 75/120) or infected colleagues (30.8%, 37/120) was the most common mode of transmission. About 78.3% (94/120) of the infected cases wore surgical masks, whereas 20.8% (25/120) failed to use protection when exposed to the source of infection. Severe infections were observed in 11.7% (14/120) of the cases, with one death (0.8%, 1/120). All the infected medical staff members had been discharged from the hospital. A total of 1,287 medical staff members were dispatched to participate in the frontline response to COVID-19 under level 2 protection of whom one was infected. Medical staff members who took inadequate protection had a higher risk of contracting infection than those using level 2 protection (relative risk: 36.9; 95% confidence interval: 5.2-263.6). Interpretation Neurosurgical staff members in Hubei province were seriously affected by COVID-19. Level 2 protection and strengthening of protective measures are likely to be effective in preventing medical workers from being infected.","Wang, Qiangping; Huang, Xing; Bai, Yansen; Wang, Xuan; Wang, Haijun; Hu, Xuebin; Wang, Feng; Wang, Xianke; Chen, Jincao; Chen, Qianxue; Jiang, Xiaobing; Zhao, Hongyang",,331,24

Some patients experience frequent exacerbations, and are now recognized as a distinct clinical subgroup, the ‘frequent exacerbator’ phenotype. This is relatively stable over time, occurs across disease severity, and is associated with poorer health outcomes. These patients are therefore a priority for research and treatment. The pathophysiology underlying the frequent exacerbator phenotype is complex, with increased airway and systemic inflammation, dynamic lung hyperinflation, changes in lower airway bacterial colonization and a possible increased susceptibility to viral infection. Frequent exacerbators are also at increased risk from comorbid extrapulmonary diseases including cardiovascular disease, gastroesophageal reflux, depression, osteoporosis and cognitive impairment. Overall these patients have poorer health status, accelerated forced expiratory volume over 1 s (FEV1) decline, worsened quality of life, and increased hospital admissions and mortality, contributing to increased exacerbation susceptibility and perpetuation of the frequent exacerbator phenotype.

Here, we describe the response of the blood service, the impact on blood donation and the effects on the blood supply in Hong Kong posed by the earlier SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003. The infection, like SARS‐CoV‐2 was highly contagious through droplet transmission. In the 2003 SARS epidemic in Hong Kong, donor and staff safety was secured by using stringent infection control measures to protect both donors and staff from contacting the virus. All the donors were requested to wear face masks within the donation venue and use an alcohol‐based hand rinse. The donors' body temperature was checked before donation and staff's body temperatures were checked daily. The safety of the blood supply was secured by a donor deferral policy for 4 weeks following contact with a confirmed or suspected case of and a post‐donation call‐back system. Despite scheduling mobile donation sessions and a decrease in donors attending blood donor centers, the blood supply was maintained as there was a 12.8% reduction of the demand of blood and only a 16.9% reduction in the blood donation.

The individual cognitive stimulation therapy (iCST) app aims to provide cognitive stimulation and social interaction to people with dementia and carers through interactive touchscreen technology. The iCST app has been developed according to the principles of CST and iCST, which have previously shown to improve the cognition and quality of life of people with dementia and benefit the relationship between the person with dementia and his/her carer. The iCST app has also shown to improve the quality of the carer’s life. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the usability of the iCST app intervention and the feasibility of conducting a full-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the clinical effectiveness of the iCST app intervention compared to that of treatment-as-usual for people with mild-to-moderate dementia. METHODS: We aim to recruit 60 people with mild-to-moderate dementia and their informal carers as dyads in a multi-center feasibility RCT with a treatment-as-usual control group. Both parties must be able to provide informed consent and participate in the intervention. Dyads will complete a baseline assessment that will include cognition and quality of life measures and they will subsequently be randomized (1:1) to the iCST app intervention in addition to usual care or to usual care only. All participants will be followed up at 5 weeks and at 11 weeks after the baseline assessments. A range of feasibility outcomes will be assessed, including recruitment and retention rates, intervention fidelity and usability, and acceptability of the outcome measures. A sample of the experimental group will be invited to a semistructured posttrial interview to further examine the experience of using the iCST app. RESULTS: This study received funding in May 2015 and obtained ethical approval in March 2018. Data collection began in November 2018 and was completed in March 2020 with a total of 61 dyads recruited. Data analyses are in progress and the final results are expected to be available in the spring of 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This study will investigate whether it is feasible to conduct a full-scale RCT to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the iCST app in comparison to that of usual care alone. In addition, this study will examine the usability of the iCST app. The data will provide information on potential modifications to be made to the intervention, study design, and study process.

Methods: From December 14, 2020, to January 31, 2021, an anonymous cross-sectional online survey was conducted on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy for children among reproductive women in China. We assessed risk perception, including perceived susceptibility, severity, barriers, and benefits using the health belief model, and then classified each variable into three groups (low, moderate, and high) based on tertiles. Information on sociodemographic characteristics, health status, and knowledge of COVID-19 was also collected. The Pearson χ(2)-test was used to compare vaccine hesitancy among the above mentioned factors. Logistic regression models were used to calculate the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of risk perception related to vaccine hesitancy after controlling for the above covariates. Results: Among 3,011 reproductive women, 8.44% (95%CI: 7.44. 9.43) had COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine hesitancy was observed more in women who lived in eastern China (11.63%), aged >45 years (12.00%), had a lower than high school education level (12.77%), and a low score on knowledge of COVID-19 (12.22%). Vaccine hesitancy was associated with lower perceived susceptibility (moderate: aOR = 1.72, 95%CI: 1.17–2.54, P = 0.0061; low: aOR = 2.44, 95%CI: 1.60–3.70, P < 0.0001), high perceived barriers (aOR = 2.86, 95%CI: 1.57–5.22, P < 0.0001), and lower perceived benefit (moderate: aOR = 3.29, 95%CI: 2.30–4.70, P < 0.0001; low: aOR = 4.59, 95%CI: 2.98–7.07, P < 0.0001), but not with perceived severity. Conclusions: Although the proportion of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy for children among Chinese reproductive women was <1 out of 10, to improve COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, our findings suggest that tailored public health measures are needed to increase perceived susceptibility and benefit, and decrease perceived barriers among reproductive women.","Du, Min; Tao, Liyuan; Liu, Jue",Front Med (Lausanne),331,29
