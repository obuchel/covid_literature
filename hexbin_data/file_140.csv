294,294,294,Development of a fluorescent quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for the detection of Goose parvovirus in vivo,12.279857,9.357106,2009-09-15,"BACKGROUND: Goose parvovirus (GPV) is a Dependovirus associated with latent infection and mortality in geese. Currently, it severely affects geese production worldwide. The objective of this study was to develop a fluorescent quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (FQ-PCR) assay for fast and accurate quantification of GPV DNA in infected goslings, which can aid in the understanding of the regular distribution pattern and the nosogenesis of GPV in vivo. RESULTS: The detection limit of the assay was 2.8 × 10(1 )standard DNA copies, with a sensitivity of 3 logs higher than that of the conventional gel-based PCR assay targeting the same gene. The real-time PCR was reproducible, as shown by satisfactory low intraassay and interassay coefficients of variation. CONCLUSION: The high sensitivity, specificity, simplicity, and reproducibility of the GPV fluorogenic PCR assay, combined with a high throughput, make this method suitable for a broad spectrum of GPV etiology-related applications.","Yang, Jin-Long; Cheng, An-Chun; Wang, Ming-Shu; Pan, Kang-Cheng; Li, Min; Guo, Yu-Fei; Li, Chuan-Feng; Zhu, De-Kang; Chen, Xiao-Yue",Virol J,140,1

Although several genes are commonly used as reference genes (such as GAPDH, ACTB, and 18S rRNA), they are also regulated and can be expressed at varying levels. In this study, we evaluated twelve well-known reference genes to identify the most suitable housekeeping gene for normalization of qRT-PCR in human lumbar vertebral endplate with Modic changes, by using the geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper algorithms. Our results showed that the rarely-used SDHA was the most stable single reference gene, and a combination of three, SDHA, B2M, and LDHA, was the most suitable gene set for normalization in all samples. In addition, the commonly-used genes, GAPDH, ACTB and 18S rRNA, were all inappropriate as internal standards. The rankings of reference genes for the three types of Modic change differed, although SDHA and RPL13A uniformly ranked in the first and last position, respectively. Further simulated expression analysis validated that the arbitrary use of a reference gene could lead to the misinterpretation of data. Our study confirmed the necessity of exploring the expression stability of potential reference genes in each specific tissue and experimental situation before quantitative evaluation of gene expression by qRT-PCR.","Zhou, Zhi-Jie; Zhang, Jian-Feng; Xia, Ping; Wang, Ji-Ying; Chen, Shuai; Fang, Xiang-Qian; Fan, Shun-Wu",PLoS One,140,11
1829,1829,1829,Strand-Specific Quantitative Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction Assay for Measurement of Arenavirus Genomic and Antigenomic RNAs,12.218174,9.609718,2015-05-15,"Arenaviruses are bi-segmented, single-stranded RNA viruses that cause significant human disease. The manner in which they regulate the replication of their genome is not well-understood. This is partly due to the absence of a highly sensitive assay to measure individual species of arenavirus replicative RNAs. To overcome this obstacle, we designed a quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay for selective quantitation of each of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) genomic or antigenomic RNAs. During the course of assay design, we identified a nonspecific priming phenomenon whereby, in the absence of an RT primer, cDNAs complementary to each of the LCMV replicative RNA species are generated during RT. We successfully circumvented this nonspecific priming event through the use of biotinylated primers in the RT reaction, which permitted affinity purification of primer-specific cDNAs using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. As proof of principle, we used the assay to map the dynamics of LCMV replication at acute and persistent time points and to determine the quantities of genomic and antigenomic RNAs that are incorporated into LCMV particles. This assay can be adapted to measure total S or L segment-derived viral RNAs and therefore represents a highly sensitive diagnostic platform to screen for LCMV infection in rodent and human tissue samples and can also be used to quantify virus-cell attachment.","Haist, Kelsey; Ziegler, Christopher; Botten, Jason",PLoS One,140,1

2677,2677,2677,Internal control for real-time polymerase chain reaction based on MS2 bacteriophage for RNA viruses diagnostics,12.304606,9.412714,2017-04-06,"BACKGROUND: Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is routinely used to detect viral infections. In Brazil, it is mandatory the use of nucleic acid tests to detect hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus in blood banks because of the immunological window. The use of an internal control (IC) is necessary to differentiate the true negative results from those consequent from a failure in some step of the nucleic acid test. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was the construction of virus-modified particles, based on MS2 bacteriophage, to be used as IC for the diagnosis of RNA viruses. METHODS: The MS2 genome was cloned into the pET47b(+) plasmid, generating pET47b(+)-MS2. MS2-like particles were produced through the synthesis of MS2 RNA genome by T7 RNA polymerase. These particles were used as non-competitive IC in assays for RNA virus diagnostics. In addition, a competitive control for HCV diagnosis was developed by cloning a mutated HCV sequence into the MS2 replicase gene of pET47b(+)-MS2, which produces a non-propagating MS2 particle. The utility of MS2-like particles as IC was evaluated in a one-step format multiplex real-time RT-PCR for HCV detection. FINDINGS: We demonstrated that both competitive and non-competitive IC could be successfully used to monitor the HCV amplification performance, including the extraction, reverse transcription, amplification and detection steps, without compromising the detection of samples with low target concentrations. In conclusion, MS2-like particles generated by this strategy proved to be useful IC for RNA virus diagnosis, with advantage that they are produced by a low cost protocol. An attractive feature of this system is that it allows the construction of a multicontrol by the insertion of sequences from more than one pathogen, increasing its applicability for diagnosing different RNA viruses.","Zambenedetti, Miriam Ribas; Pavoni, Daniela Parada; Dallabona, Andreia Cristine; Dominguez, Alejandro Correa; Poersch, Celina de Oliveira; Fragoso, Stenio Perdigão; Krieger, Marco Aurélio",Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz,140,1
5829,5829,5829,Dimensions of superspreading,12.275736,4.4080095,2005-11-16,"Enveloped viruses have evolved complex glycoprotein machinery that drives the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, permitting entry of the viral genome into the cell. For the paramyxoviruses, the fusion (F) protein catalyses this membrane merger and entry step, and it has been postulated that the F protein undergoes complex refolding during this process. Here we report the crystal structure of the parainfluenza virus 5 F protein in its prefusion conformation, stabilized by the addition of a carboxy-terminal trimerization domain. The structure of the F protein shows that there are profound conformational differences between the pre- and postfusion states, involving transformations in secondary and tertiary structure. The positions and structural transitions of key parts of the fusion machinery, including the hydrophobic fusion peptide and two helical heptad repeat regions, clarify the mechanism of membrane fusion mediated by the F protein.

7757,7757,7757,Case Report: Presumed Respiratory Syncytial Virus Pneumonia in Three Immunocompromised Adults,12.108195,9.305479,2016-01-14,"Viral particles of a neurotropic murine hepatitis virus (JHM) and various substances known to have immunoregulatory effects, including bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and synthetic adjuvant peptide (muramyl dipeptide) (AP), were tested for their ability to induce Ia antigen expression on Lewis rat astrocytes in vitro. JHM virus, LPS and AP are all capable of inducing Ia molecules on astrocytes, however, in a pattern and kinetics distinct from recombinant rat gamma interferon (γ-IFN). Whereas γ-IFN induced Ia expression on astrocytes and all macrophages after 48 h treatment, JHM virus, LPS and AP required 4–7 days for maximal induction of Ia on astrocytes, but had little to no effect on the macrophage population. This indicates that astrocytes are uniquely reactive to components derived from infectious agents and that these components are immunoregulatory with respect to Ia expression on astrocytes. We have also attempted to determine possible mechanisms by which these agents induce astrocyte Ia and show that phorbol myristate acetate and Ca(2+) ionophore A23187 have similar effects. These findings suggest that infectious agents may directly stimulate antigen presenting functions of astrocytes in the brain through γ-IFN-independent mechanisms.","Massa, Paul T.; Meulen, Volker ter",J Neuroimmunol,140,0

Although several studies have reported nosocomial outbreaks in neonatal intensive care units, molecular epidemiology data are scarce. Here, the authors describe two consecutive respiratory syncytial virus outbreaks caused by genotypes ON-1 and NA-2 in a neonatal intensive care unit in São Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: A prospective search for respiratory syncytial virus was performed after diagnosing the index case and four other symptomatic newborns in the neonatal intensive care unit. Nasopharyngeal aspirate samples of all patients in the neonatal intensive care unit were tested for 17 respiratory viruses using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Genotyping was performed using nucleotide sequencing. RESULTS: From May to August 2013, two different outbreaks were detected in the neonatal intensive care unit. A total of 20 infants were infected with respiratory syncytial virus-A (ten and 14 with ON-1 and NA-2 genotypes, respectively). The mean age of the infants was 10 days, mean birth weight was 1,961 g, and the mean gestational age was 33 weeks. Risk factors (heart disease, lung disease, and prematurity) were present in 80% and 85.7% of infants in the ON-1 and NA-2 groups, respectively. In total, 45.8% of infants were asymptomatic and 20.8% required mechanical ventilation. Coinfections were not detected during the outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: Infants in a neonatal intensive care unit who develop abrupt respiratory symptoms should be tested for respiratory viruses, especially respiratory syncytial virus. Even in the absence of severe symptoms, respiratory syncytial virus detection can prevent nosocomial transmission through infection control measures. A better understanding of respiratory syncytial virus molecular epidemiology is essential for developing new vaccines and antiviral drugs against respiratory syncytial virus.","Silva, Daniella Gregoria Bomfim Prado da; Almeida, Flávia Jacqueline; Arnoni, Mariana Volpe; Sáfadi, Marco Aurélio Palazzi; Mimica, Marcelo Jenne; Jarovsky, Daniel; Rossetti, Gabriela Pereira de Almeida; Magalhães, Mauricio; Oliveira, Danielle Bruna Leal de; Thomazelli, Luciano Matsumiya; Colmanetti, Thais Cristina; Durigon, Edison Luiz; Berezin, Eitan Naaman",J Pediatr (Rio J),140,11

Acute liver failure is the common final pathway of a multitude of conditions and insults, all of which result in massive hepatic necrosis or loss of normal hepatic function. The ensuing multiorgan system failure frequently has a fatal outcome, with mortality rates in most series ranging from approximately 55% to 95% [1]. Acute liver failure (ALF, previously often referred to as fulminant hepatic failure (FHF)) knows no age boundaries, with many cases occurring in those younger than 30 years. Short of excellent intensive care unit (ICU) support and liver transplantation in selected cases, few viable treatment options are available. Over the past few decades, however, survival has been improved by anticipation, recognition, and early treatment of associated complications, as well as the application of prognostic criteria for early identification of patients requiring liver transplantation (along with improvement in the techniques and science of transplantation itself). The etiology of ALF varies from country to country and the incidence change over time. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) has now replaced viral hepatitis as the leading cause of ALF [2]. In a study from London including 310 patients with ALF in the period 1994–2004, 42% of the cases were caused by paracetamol [3], whereas this was only the cause in 2% of 267 patients in Spain from 1992 to 2000 [4]. However, less than 10% of all liver transplants are performed in patients with ALF [5, 6].","Dalhoff, Kim",Critical Care Toxicology,140,1

Two main endothelial ligand–receptor pathways regulating angiogenesis are vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor and angiopoietin-TIE receptor pathways. The angiopoietin-TIE pathway is required for the remodeling and maturation of the blood and lymphatic vessels during embryonic development after VEGF and VEGF-C mediated development of the primary vascular plexus. Angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT1) stabilizes the vasculature after angiogenic processes, via tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin-like and EGF-like domains 2 (TIE2) activation. In contrast, ANGPT2 is upregulated at sites of vascular remodeling. ANGPT2 is secreted by activated endothelial cells in inflammation, promoting vascular destabilization. ANGPT2 has been found to be expressed in many human cancers. Intriguingly, in preclinical models inhibition of ANGPT2 has provided promising results in preventing tumor angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis, making it an attractive candidate to target in tumors. However, until now the first ANGPT2 targeting therapies have been less effective in clinical trials than in experimental models. Additionally, in preclinical models combined therapy against ANGPT2 and VEGF or immune checkpoint inhibitors has been superior to monotherapies, and these pathways are also targeted in early clinical trials. In order to improve current anti-angiogenic therapies and successfully exploit ANGPT2 as a target for cancer treatment, the biology of the angiopoietin-TIE pathway needs to be profoundly clarified.","Kiss, Elina A.; Saharinen, Pipsa",Tumor Angiogenesis,140,1

Thus, the optimal target PaO(2) for patients recovering from cardiac arrest (CA) has been extensively examined. Many patients develop hypoxic brain injury after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC); this supports the need for oxygen administration in patients after CA. Insufficient oxygen delivery due to decreased blood flow to cerebral tissue during CA results in hypoxic brain injury. By contrast, hyperoxia may increase dissolved oxygen in the blood and, subsequently, generate reactive oxygen species that are harmful to neuronal cells. This secondary brain injury is particularly concerning. Although several clinical studies demonstrated that hyperoxia during post-CA care was associated with poor neurological outcomes, considerable debate is ongoing because of inconsistent results. Potential reasons for the conflicting results include differences in the definition of hyperoxia, the timing of exposure to hyperoxia, and PaO(2) values used in analyses. Despite the conflicts, exposure to PaO(2) > 300 mmHg through administration of unnecessary oxygen should be avoided because no obvious benefit has been demonstrated. The feasibility of titrating oxygen administration by targeting SpO(2) at approximately 94% in patients recovering from CA has been demonstrated in pilot randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

The current study attempts to reveal lymphocyte-related immune characteristics of active tuberculosis (ATB) patients and establish immunodiagnostic model for discriminating ATB from latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and healthy controls (HC). METHODS: A total of 171 subjects consisted of 54 ATB, 57 LTBI, and 60 HC were consecutively recruited at Tongji hospital from January 2019 to January 2021. All participants were tested for lymphocyte subsets, phenotype, and function. Other examination including T-SPOT and microbiological detection for MTB were performed simultaneously. RESULTS: Compared with LTBI and HC, ATB patients exhibited significantly lower number and function of lymphocytes including CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells and NK cells, and significantly higher T cell activation represented by HLA-DR and proportion of immunosuppressive cells represented by Treg. An immunodiagnostic model based on the combination of NK cell number, HLA-DR(+)CD3(+) T cells, Treg, CD4(+) T cell function, and NK cell function was built using logistic regression. Based on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) of the diagnostic model was 0.920 (95% CI, 0.867-0.973) in distinguishing ATB from LTBI, while the cut-off value of 0.676 produced a sensitivity of 81.48% (95% CI, 69.16%-89.62%) and specificity of 91.23% (95% CI, 81.06%-96.20%). Meanwhile, AUC analysis between ATB and HC according to the diagnostic model was 0.911 (95% CI, 0.855-0.967), with a sensitivity of 81.48% (95% CI, 69.16%-89.62%) and a specificity of 90.00% (95% CI, 79.85%-95.34%).

In order to determine how moral foundations contribute to empathic traits and moral identity, we performed classical correlation analysis as well as Bayesian correlation analysis, Bayesian ANCOVA, and Bayesian regression analysis. Results showed that individualizing foundations (harm/care, fairness/reciprocity) and binding foundations (ingroup/loyalty, authority/respect, purity/sanctity) had various different relationships with empathic traits. In addition, the individualizing versus binding foundations showed somewhat reverse relationships with internalization and symbolization of moral identity. This suggests that moral foundations can contribute to further understanding of empathic traits and moral identity and how they relate to moral behavior in reality. We discuss the implications of these results for moral educators when starting to teach students about moral issues.

Unlike other systemic or localized aspergillosis, there are no specific guidelines for isolated laryngeal aspergillosis. Our experience of dealing with a wide variety of isolated laryngeal aspergillosis showed that this entity is very responsive to medical therapy, making extensive debridement (as often carried out in surgically accessible aspergillosis) unnecessary as it would invariably lead to long-term dysphonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of all cases of isolated aspergillus laryngitis that presented to our hospital over the past 5 years was carried out. All patients with confirmed histopathological diagnosis of aspergillus infection were included. RESULTS Twelve patients (five males and seven females) aged 28-54 years, who were diagnosed with aspergillus laryngitis presented with dysphonia. The most common involved site was the true vocal cords. All patients underwent cautious biopsies either in the operating theatre or in-office using a channeled fiber-optic laryngoscope. On histopathological examination, eight had invasive aspergillus infection while others showed variety of noninvasive involvement including colonization of cysts and carcinoma in situ. The most common species isolated was Aspergillus fumigatus. Appropriate antifungal chemotherapy was prescribed after ruling out systemic involvement. None of the patients showed recurrence or residual lesions on follow-up and reported significantly improved voice. CONCLUSIONS This study highlights the wide spectrum of presentation of isolated aspergillus laryngitis with Aspergillus fumigatus being the most common organism isolated. Even the invasive variant is a medically treatable condition with voriconazole being the drug of choice. The importance of cautious biopsies and resections for voice preservation is also emphasized. To our knowledge, this is the largest report on isolated aspergillus laryngitis.","Sheth, Meet Chetan; Paul, Roshna Rose; Mathews, Suma Susan; Albert, Rita Ruby",Journal of voice : official journal of the Voice Foundation,140,26

We investigated IFN inductions by respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), measles virus and mumps virus in human nasal epithelial cells (NECs). IFN-λ, but not IFN-β/α, was induced by respiratory virus infection in primary NECs and immortalized NECs through transfection with the human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (hTERT-NECs). In contrast, both IFN-λ and IFN-β/α were induced by RSV infection in human bronchiolar carcinoma cell line A549. Suppression of retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) expression using siRNA significantly reduced IFN-λ1 production in RSV-infected hTERT-NECs, while suppression of melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) expression did not. Exogenous IFN-λ1 treatment suppressed RSV replication and chemokine induction in hTERT-NECs. These data indicate that IFN-λ, but not IFN-β/α, contributes to the main first line defense via RIG-I-dependent pathway against respiratory virus infection in NECs.","Okabayashi, Tamaki; Kojima, Takashi; Masaki, Tomoyuki; Yokota, Shin-Ichi; Imaizumi, Tadaatsu; Tsutsumi, Hiroyuki; Himi, Tetsuo; Fujii, Nobuhiro; Sawada, Norimasa",Virus research,140,20

These changes may arise from elongation of the Achilles tendon. An observational study was performed to quantify the Achilles tendon resting angle (ATRA) in patients following Achilles tendon rupture, surgical repair, and rehabilitation, respectively. Methods Between May 2012 and January 2013, 26 consecutive patients (17 men), with a mean (standard deviation, SD) age of 42 (8) years were included and evaluated following injury, repair, and at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months, respectively (rehabilitation period). The outcome was measured using the ATRA, Achilles tendon total rupture score (ATRS), and heel-rise test. Results Following rupture, the mean (SD) absolute ATRA was 55 (8)° for the injured side compared with 43 (7)° (p < 0.001) for the noninjured side. Immediately after repair, the angle reduced to 37 (9)° (p < 0.001). The difference between the injured and noninjured sides, the relative ATRA, was -12.5 (4.3)° following injury; this was reduced to 7 (7.9)° following surgery (p < 0.001). During initial rehabilitation, at the 6-week time point, the relative ATRA was 2.6 (6.2)° (p = 0.04) and at 3 months it was -6.5 (6.5)° (p < 0.001). After the 3-month time point, there were no significant changes in the resting angle. The ATRS improved significantly (p < 0.001) during each period up to 9 months following surgery, where a score of 85 (10)° was reported. The heel-rise limb symmetry index was 66 (22)% at 9 months and 82 (14)% at 12 months. At 3 months and 6 months, the absolute ATRA correlated with the ATRS (r = 0.63, p = 0.001, N = 26 and r = 0.46, p = 0.027, N = 23, respectively). At 12 months, the absolute ATRA correlated with the heel-rise height (r = -0.63, p = 0.002, N = 22). Conclusion The ATRA increases following injury, is reduced by surgery, and then increases again during initial rehabilitation. The angle also correlates with patient-reported symptoms early in the rehabilitation phase and with heel-rise height after 1 year. The ATRA might be considered a simple and effective means to evaluate Achilles tendon function 1 year after the rupture.","Carmont, Michael R; Grävare Silbernagel, Karin; Brorsson, Annelie; Olsson, Nicklas; Maffulli, Nicola; Karlsson, Jon","Asia-Pacific journal of sports medicine, arthroscopy, rehabilitation and technology",140,1

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate our novel technique to fix the anvil into the esophagus. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 202 patients who were treated at our institution with an intracorporeal circular esophagojejunostomy in a laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy with a Roux-en-Y reconstruction (166 cases) or a laparoscopy-assisted proximal gastrectomy with jejunal interposition (36 cases). After incising 3/4 of the esophageal wall, a hand-sewn purse-string suture was placed on the esophagus. Next, the anvil head of a circular stapler was introduced into the esophagus. Finally, the circular esophagojejunostomy was performed laparoscopically. The clinical characteristics and surgical outcomes were evaluated and compared with those of other methods. Results The average operation time was 200.3 minutes. The average hand-sewn purse-string suturing time was 6.4 minutes. The overall incidence of postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo classification grade ≥II) was 26%. The number of patients with an anastomotic leakage and stenosis at the esophagojejunostomy site were 4 (2.0%) and 12 (6.0%), respectively. All patients with stenosis were successfully treated by endoscopic balloon dilatation. There was no mortality. Regarding the materials and devices for anvil fixation, only 1 absorbable thread was needed. Conclusions Our procedure for hand-sewn purse-string suturing with the double ligation method is simple and safe.","Takayama, Yuichi; Kaneoka, Yuji; Maeda, Atsuyuki; Fukami, Yasuyuki; Takahashi, Takamasa; Uji, Masahito",Journal of gastric cancer,140,27

We carried out a prospective, randomised clinical trial to study the effect of nitrous oxide (N2O) on the BIS values at an equi-minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of sevoflurane and desflurane. METHODS Sixty adult patients undergoing spine surgery were randomised into two groups; Group S (sevoflurane; n = 30) and Group D (desflurane; n = 30) for the maintenance of anaesthesia in oxygen and air or oxygen and N2O mixture (FiO2-0.4) (Stage 1). BIS and fraction of inspired and end-tidal concentration of agents were noted at 1.0 MAC. In Stage 2, air or N2O was discontinued and the other carrier gas was introduced. At steady state of this carrier gas, values were again noted as in Stage 1. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni correction, and Student's t-test for paired data. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS With air-oxygen as the carrier gas, sevoflurane and desflurane resulted in comparable BIS values (P = 0.44). With addition of 60% N2O, there was a significant increase in BIS values at 1.0 MAC for both the agents. Furthermore, higher BIS values were observed with sevoflurane compared to desflurane (P = 0.01). CONCLUSION Sevoflurane and desflurane at equi-MAC concentration exert similar effect on BIS values when used with air-oxygen. N2O results in higher BIS values; this effect is more pronounced in combination with sevoflurane.","Mishra, Rajeeb Kumar; Mahajan, Charu; Prabhakar, Hemanshu; Kapoor, Indu; Bithal, Parmod Kumar",Indian journal of anaesthesia,140,31

The subsequent increase in referrals for pectus excavatum repair provided large patient series for clinical analyses to better define underlying physiologic impairments and stimulated surgeons to develop technical improvements to enhance the safety and effectiveness of pectus excavatum repair. RECENT FINDINGS Clinical assessment, diagnostic imaging, and cardiorespiratory testing of patients with pectus excavatum have helped to characterize physiologic impairments associated with severe pectus excavatum and to define inclusion criteria for surgical repair. Appropriate timing of repair is important to minimize complications, especially recurrence. Evidence of improved cardiorespiratory function after pectus excavatum repair has been presented. As a result of numerous technical improvements, safe and effective operative correction of pectus excavatum has been reported for both the Nuss procedure and open repair. SUMMARY The findings presented in this review provide objective evidence of the cardiorespiratory impairment associated with severe pectus excavatum. Clinical identification of affected patients should prompt timely work-up and referral for pectus excavatum repair if inclusion criteria are met.

A total of 358 Italian students aged 18-30 completed socio-demographic questionnaires and the Beck Depression Inventory - 2 (BDI-2), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory - Revised (OCI-R), the Eating Habits Questionnaire (EHQ), and the Eating Disorder Inventory-3 (EDI-3). We applied multiple regression models to evince any changes in the aforementioned questionnaire scores during and after lockdown with respect to the scores before lockdown. Students reported on average worse depressive symptoms during lockdown than 6 months before isolation (median increase in the BDI-2 score +2; IQR = -3, 6; β = 0.09 ± 0.03, p = 0.005), with students without any established diagnosis of psychopathology being affected the most. The regression models predict that 86.2% (IQR = 67.9, 91.4%) of students would not experience a clinically significant worsening of symptoms, while approximately 6% of our target population could develop more severe depressive symptoms. This study supports the view that depressive symptomatology may be aggravated during lockdown, but also highlights that after the lifting of lockdown any changes quickly vanished, as the BDI-2 scores were not different from the ones reported before lockdown.","Meda, Nicola; Pardini, Susanna; Slongo, Irene; Bodini, Luca; Zordan, Mauro Agostino; Rigobello, Paolo; Visioli, Francesco; Novara, Caterina",Journal of psychiatric research,140,5

CASE PRESENTATION A 71-year-old male who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic right lower lobectomy with lymph node dissection for primary lung cancer developed severe stabbing pain in his right shoulder and high fever 3 days after the operation. The fever persisted, the cough became more productive, and a plain chest X-ray showed slight a few infiltrative opacities in the right lung field. Intravenous antibiotic therapy was initiated. The patient developed a right pneumothorax 5 days after the operation, and contaminated discharge from the right chest tube was noted. A chest computed tomography showed right-sided empyema, while bronchoscopic examination revealed no evidence of a bronchopleural fistula. Open-window thoracostomy (OWT) was performed. Finally, 2 days after the OWT, the patient was diagnosed as having an EPF, because the right chest cavity was found to be contaminated with food materials. Ample purification of the right chest cavity was achieved by repeated dressing changes, and the EPF was finally closed by omentopexy. The post-surgical course was uneventful. Five weeks after the omentopexy, an esophagogram revealed no leakage of the contrast medium from the esophageal wall. The patient was discharged 13 weeks after the omentopexy.

Improved surveillance in the southern hemisphere is needed to provide critical data on influenza epidemiology, disease burden, circulating strains and effectiveness of influenza prevention and control measures. Hospital-based surveillance for severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases was established in New Zealand on 30 April 2012. The aims were to measure incidence, prevalence, risk factors, clinical spectrum and outcomes for SARI and associated influenza and other respiratory pathogen cases as well as to understand influenza contribution to patients not meeting SARI case definition. METHODS/DESIGN All inpatients with suspected respiratory infections who were admitted overnight to the study hospitals were screened daily. If a patient met the World Health Organization's SARI case definition, a respiratory specimen was tested for influenza and other respiratory pathogens.

For instance, basicity has been correlated with molecular promiscuity, hERG blockade, and phospholipidosis. Nonetheless, a systematic characterization of the acid/base profile of epigenomic databases has not been reported. The present study describes an analysis of the acidic ionization constants distribution of a library of 7820 compounds with reported activity against epigenetic targets. Furthermore, the epigenomics database's acid/base profile is compared to the reference libraries of food chemicals, natural products, and approved drugs. It was found that the acid/base profile of histone lysine demethylase ligands is more similar to previously approved drugs, and histone acetyltransferase ligands have acidic and basic functional groups largely found in food chemicals and natural products, which support the potential of these libraries for finding new epigenetic inhibitors.","Santibáñez-Morán, Marisa G; Medina-Franco, Jose Luis",ChemMedChem,140,8

PURPOSE To determine the relationship between urinary and hematological hydration biomarkers with TFI in PREG and LACT. METHODS Eighteen PREG/LACT (age: 31 ± 3 years, pre-pregnancy BMI: 24.26 ± 5.85 kg m-2) collected 24-h urine samples, recorded TFI, and provided a blood sample at 5 time points (15 ± 2, 26 ± 1, 37 ± 1 weeks gestation, 3 ± 1 and 9 ± 1 weeks postpartum during lactation); 18 pair-matched non-pregnant (NP), non-lactating (NL) women (age: 29 ± 4 years, BMI: 24.1 ± 3.7 kg m-2) provided samples at similar time intervals. Twenty-four-hour urine volume (U VOL), osmolality (U OSM), specific gravity (U SG), and color (U COL) were measured. Hematocrit, serum osmolality (S OSM), and serum total protein (S TP) were measured in blood. RESULTS Significant relationships were present between TFI and urinary biomarkers in all women (P < 0.004); these relationships were not different between PREG and NP, and LACT and NL, except U VOL in PREG (P = 0.0017). No significant relationships between TFI and hematological biomarkers existed (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION Urinary biomarkers of hydration, but not hematological biomarkers, have a strong relationship with TFI in PREG, LACT, NP, and NL women. These data suggest that urinary biomarkers of hydration reflect TFI during pregnancy and breast-feeding.","McKenzie, Amy L; Perrier, Erica T; Guelinckx, Isabelle; Kavouras, Stavros A; Aerni, Giselle; Lee, Elaine C; Volek, Jeff S; Maresh, Carl M; Armstrong, Lawrence E",European journal of nutrition,140,1

This meant a challenge for the care of mentally ill hospitalized patients. There was a social shut-down in Bavaria with a decrease in social contacts. The present study deals with psychiatric care provided to these patients by psychologists and psychiatrists working in the home office and in the clinic. Psychologists from the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at LMU Munich, together with physicians working in the clinic, established telephone-based patient care for inpatients during the acute crisis in the home office during quarantine, in which 23 patients with depressive and schizophrenic disorders participated. Psychologists then worked in the hospital with 98 hospitalized patients. Current distress and its stresses were addressed and new therapeutic components were integrated into care. The feasibility of home office, its possibilities and limitations are presented. In this study, care concepts for hospitalized patients with affective and schizophrenic disorders as well as current stress factors and psychotherapeutic concepts will be addressed. The current approach was positively evaluated by patients and physicians and is thus promising in the current situation. With the exception of patients in the acute ward, all patients and even older ones benefited from this measure. During the crisis from March to August, all psychologists worked on full-time positions with the usual treatment frequency of 1-2 sessions a week, which was especially important for elderly individuals. During the acute COVID-19 crisis, there was a pause only in the treatment of ward-wide groups and family groups. Psychologists, like physicians and nurses, had a system-relevant role to play.","Schaub, Annette; Michel, Clara; Beck, Paula; Falkai, Peter",Fortschritte der Neurologie-Psychiatrie,140,23

METHODS A hand-held surgical device with enhanced intuitive manipulability and stable grip force was proposed for minimally invasive surgery (MIS). The dexterous instrument and isomorphic handle were designed, and the cable transmission structure and model of the instrument were analyzed. A modeling method for grip force pre-compensation was proposed to produce stable grip forces under different posture. RESULTS The prototype of the proposed MIS device was developed, and the related experiments were carried out. The maximum opening angle error was 1.2 ° . Compared with the non-compensation model, the variation of grip force reduced 8 times with the pre-compensation model. The animal vivo experiments verified the feasibility and practicability of the device. CONCLUSIONS The proposed hand-held device could provide intuitive manipulability and stable operation, which contributes to the performance improvement of the MIS.

The activity can be instantaneously neutralized by injection of avidin, a specific antidote. We have tested the effects of this new profile anticoagulant in various thrombosis models. The antithrombotic effect of EP224283 was compared with those of the parent compounds used alone or in association at doses achieving low to moderate inhibition of platelet aggregation ex vivo. In a model of systemic thromboembolism independent of thrombin generation, tirofiban and EP224283 had similar effects at equimolar doses. On the other hand, EP224283 was more potent than tirofiban or idraparinux under thrombin-dependent conditions. In a ferric chloride-induced thrombosis model, EP224283 was more potent than either parent compound or their combination. Similar results were obtained after atherosclerotic plaque rupture in ApoE(-/-) mice. Thus, the dual action of EP224283 exceeds that of the parent compounds used in combination. A possible explanation is that EP224283 could concentrate antithrombin inside the thrombus by binding to αIIbβ3 through the tirofiban moiety, as shown by immunolabeling of the occluded vessel. No prolongation of the bleeding time was observed at doses achieving strong antithrombotic effects, suggesting that low to moderate αIIbβ3 inhibition combined with factor Xa inhibition minimizes the bleeding risk. The favorable antithrombotic profile of EP224283 together with its possible neutralization by avidin makes it an interesting drug candidate for the treatment and prevention of acute ischemic events.","Hechler, Béatrice; Freund, Monique; Alame, Ghina; Leguay, Cécile; Gaertner, Sébastien; Cazenave, Jean-Pierre; Petitou, Maurice; Gachet, Christian",The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,140,20

Resumption of employment after lung transplantation is generally supported. In Switzerland, there are no data on long-term employment in people with cystic fibrosis undergoing lung transplantation. METHODS In a single-centre, cross-sectional study at a Swiss university hospital, clinical data from lung transplant recipients with cystic fibrosis, covering the transplantation period from January 1996 to December 2016, were analysed retrospectively. The potential influence of pre-lung transplantation factors (age, sex, lung function, body mass index, six-minute walk test distance, lung transplantation wait list time, paid employment on the wait list, education, relationship status, housing situation) and post-lung transplantation factors (chronic allograft dysfunction [CLAD], dialysis, cancer diagnosis [except skin cancer]) on paid employment and work percentage after lung transplantation were investigated using mixed logistic and linear regression models. Descriptive analyses of paid employment were performed for various periods after lung transplantation (<1, 1–3, 3–5, 5–10, >10 years). Data are reported as odds ratios (ORs) or coefficients (β) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS Eighty-four subjects (46.4% female) with a mean ± SD age of 29.9 ± 8.4 years were included in the study. Mean wait time for lung transplantation was 42.7 ± 40.2 weeks. The number (percentage) of subjects employed <1 year, 1–3 years, 3–5 years, 5–10 years and >10 years after lung transplantation was n = 23 (28%), n = 51 (65%), n = 44 (75%), n = 30 (68%) and n = 21 (75%), respectively. In mixed logistic regression models, pre-lung transplantation paid employment (OR 24.03, 95% CI 6.08 to 164.39, p <0.0001), academic education (OR 7.81, 95% CI 1.66 to 48.66, p = 0.01) and time post lung transplantation (on log scale, OR 5.81, 95% CI 3.15 to 12.78, p <0.0001) were the main factors influencing post-lung transplantation paid employment status. In mixed linear regression models, pre-lung transplantation paid employment (β = 21.40, 95% CI 10.98 to 31.81, p = 0.00014), academic education (β = 12.54, 95% CI 0.48 to 24.55, p = 0.05) and time post lung transplantation (on log scale, β = 8.96, 95% CI 6.17 to 11.82, p <0.0001) were the main factors influencing work percentage post lung transplantation. No evidence for an influence of clinical factors such as CLAD, cancer or dialysis on post-lung transplantation employment and work percentage was found. CONCLUSION Pre-transplant employment is the dominant factor influencing lung transplantation employment in people with cystic fibrosis. People with cystic fibrosis undergoing lung transplantation should be encouraged to work for as long as their health status permits. Professional reintegration after successful lung transplantation should be supported by a multi-disciplinary lung transplant team.","Radtke, Thomas; Königs, André; Chen, Xijin; Braun, Julia; Dressel, Holger; Benden, Christian",Swiss medical weekly,140,27

However, it is yet unknown if gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM)'s IPV risk has increased during this time. This article describes and analyzes IPV experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of coupled-GBMSM in the United States. We hypothesized that pandemic-driven stressors would be associated with increased IPV prevalence and severity. A sample of 214 coupled men living in the US who had previously participated in HIV-related couple studies was surveyed in July-September 2020. Respondents reported demographic, sexual and substance use behaviors, and relationship characteristics. Surveys also collected data on pandemic-related life-changes (employment, substance use, COVID-19 illness). IPV victimization and perpetration were measured with the Gay and Bisexual Men Intimate Partner Violence scale and measured individually experienced or perpetrated violence, sexual, emotional, monitoring, or controlling behaviors, and if a given behavior was new and/or had changed in frequency during the pandemic. Reported prevalence and pandemic-related changes in victimization and perpetration were described. New or more frequent IPV victimization was modeled against employment, substance use changes, COVID-19 illness, and outside sexual partners (modified by a couple's sexual agreement). IPV perpetration prevalence was 15.17%, 34.44% of which was new or more frequent. Victimization prevalence was 14.95%, of which 46.88% was new or more frequent. After adjustment, outside sexual partners were associated with IPV among those with nonmonogamous sexual agreements; each outside sexual partner increased the odds of new or more frequent victimization by 70% (OR = 1.70; 95% CI [1.16, 2.51]). Given this study's documented rise in IPV among a sample of coupled men, additional research into IPV predictors, interventions, and support strategies in GBMSM populations are warranted.","Walsh, Alison R; Sullivan, Stephen; Stephenson, Rob",Journal of interpersonal violence,140,1

Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan has been used to obtain surface area (SA) and volume (Vol.) measurements, while others have used simple mathematical formulas to obtain SA and Vol. estimates without 3D reconstruction. Our objective was to assess the correlation of SA and Vol. measurements and estimates of complex incisional hernias. METHODS We conducted a retrospective agreement study of adults who underwent abdominal wall reconstruction from 2007 to 2018. Demographics, hernia characteristics, and operative data were collected from the medical record. SA and Vol. measurements were obtained after 3D CT reconstruction. Linear CT variables were obtained independently by two surgeons and SA and Vol. estimates were calculated. Because both surgeons reported similar results, only lead author values are reported in the abstract. We used Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) to assess inter-rater agreement and the agreement between SA and Vol. measurements and estimates. RESULTS A total of 108 patients were eligible for analysis. The mean age was 57 ± 11 years and 53 (49%) were female. 42 (39%) hernias were recurrent, 10 (9%) patients had a stoma, and 9 (8%) had a history of open abdomen. The mean defect width was 11 ± 4 cm and mean defect surface area (DSA) was 150 ± 95 cm2. Inter-rater agreement of SA and Vol. estimates was high (r ≥ 0.80). There was high correlation between SA and Vol. measurements and estimates for DSA, hernia sac volume (HSV), abdominal cavity volume (ACV), and HSV/ACV ratio (r = 0.81, 0.89, 0.94 and 0.91, respectively). CONCLUSION SA and Vol. estimates demonstrated high level of agreement with SA and Vol. measurements using 3D reconstruction. SA and Vol. estimates can be obtained using simple mathematical formulas using easily obtained linear variables negating the need for the time and effort consuming 3D reconstruction.","Al-Mansour, Mazen R; Wu, Jacqueline; Gagnon, Greg; Knee, Alexander; Romanelli, John; Seymour, Neal E",Surgical endoscopy,140,1

Almost one-half (45.8 %) reported an exacerbation of patients' mental condition to a large or very large degree due to social isolation, and an equal proportion (48.2 %) reported that normal follow-up was limited. The contact between the specialist and primary health services was reduced, and 15.6 % reported that patients had failed to receive the necessary somatic medical assistance to a large or very large degree. INTERPRETATION The service for older patients with mental disorders in the specialist health service was reduced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, while coordination with the primary health service was also curtailed, and many patients deteriorated mentally as a result of the infection control measures. Collaboration between the specialist and primary health services may be an important focus area for this patient group.","Tveito, Marit; Barca, Maria; Hartberg, Cecilie Bhandari","Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",140,1

Developing and implementing novel community pharmacy services (CPSs) is a complex and acknowledged challenge, which requires comprehensive planning and the participation of relevant stakeholders. Co-design processes are participatory research approaches that can enhance the development, evaluation and implementation of health services. The aim of this study was to co-design a pharmacist-led CPS aimed at enhancing self-monitoring/screening of AF. METHODS A 3-step co-design process was conducted using qualitative methods: (1) interviews and focus group with potential service users (n = 8) to identify key needs and concerns; (2) focus group with a mixed group of stakeholders (n = 8) to generate a preliminary model of the service; and (3) focus group with community pharmacy owners and managers (n = 4) to explore the feasibility and appropriateness of the model. Data were analysed qualitatively to identify themes and intersections between themes. The JeMa2 model to conceptualize pharmacy-based health programs was used to build a theoretical model of the service. RESULTS Stakeholders delineated: a clear target population (i.e., individuals ≥65 years old, with hypertension, with or without previous AF or stroke); the components of the service (i.e., patient education; self-monitoring at home; results evaluation, referral and follow-up); and a set of circumstances that may influence the implementation of the service (e.g., quality of the service, competency of the pharmacist, inter-professional relationships, etc.). A number of strategies were recommended to enable implementation (e.g.,. endorsement by leading cardiovascular organizations, appropriate communication methods and channels between the pharmacy and the general medical practice settings, etc.). CONCLUSION A novel and preliminary model of a CPS aimed at enhancing the management of AF was generated from this participatory process. This model can be used to inform decision making processes aimed at adopting and piloting of the service. It is expected the co-designed service has been adapted to suit existing needs of patients and current care practices, which, in turn, may increase the feasibility and acceptance of the service when it is implemented into a real setting.","Sabater-Hernández, Daniel; Tudball, Jacqueline; Ferguson, Caleb; Franco-Trigo, Lucía; Hossain, Lutfun N; Benrimoj, Shalom I",BMC health services research,140,28

Nevertheless, the predictors of lymph node metastasis among patients with clinical T1 adenocarcinoma, based on the TNM classification 8th edition, remain unclear. This study aimed to identify the preoperative predictors of lymph node metastasis in clinical T1 adenocarcinoma by comparing clinicopathological characteristics between the groups with and without lymph node metastasis. Methods We performed a retrospective observational single-center study at the Sendai Kousei Hospital. From January 2012 to September 2019, we included 515 patients who underwent curative lobectomy or segmentectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection among those with clinical T1 adenocarcinoma according to the UICC-TNM staging 8th edition. They were divided into two groups: those with lymph node metastasis (positive group) and those without (negative group). The clinicopathological factors were retrospectively analyzed and compared between the groups. Results In univariate analysis, carcinoembryonic antigen (>5.0 ng/mL) (P=0.0007), maximum standardized uptake (>3.5) (P<0.0001), clinical T factor (T1c) (P<0.0001), and consolidation tumor ratio (>0.85) (P<0.0001) were significant predictors of lymph node metastasis. Multivariate analysis revealed that maximum standardized uptake SUVmax (>3.5) (odds ratio =10.4, P<0.0001) was independently associated with lymph node metastasis. In univariate analysis, carcinoembryonic antigen (>5.0) (P=0.048) was the only predictor of lymph node metastasis among patients of cT1b, while no parameters were identified as significant predictors among patients of cT1c. Conclusions SUVmax and CEA are useful preoperative predictors of lymph node metastases in patients with clinical T1 adenocarcinoma, stratified to T1b and T1c, based on the 8th TNM classification.","Nakahashi, Kenta; Tsunooka, Nobuo; Hirayama, Kyo; Matsuno, Masahiro; Endo, Mareyuki; Akahira, Junichi; Taguri, Masataka",Journal of thoracic disease,140,27

To compensate, triangulation is necessary, but the operative field becomes inadequate. To overcome this problem, intracorporeal attachable and detachable instruments can broaden the field of visceral tissue by retracting from at least 2 points. OBJECTIVE We tested this new procedure for colon cancer surgery. DESIGN This is a prospective study. SETTING This study was conducted at a single-center hospital. PATIENTS Ten consecutive patients (3 male and 7 female) with stage II or III colon cancer underwent the procedure. INTERVENTIONS All patients received a 3.0-cm incision at the umbilicus or right iliac fossa. At least 2 clips and a suspending bar were inserted through a 12-mm port in a multiport access device. The clips grasped the mesocolon at different points and were retracted with either an extracorporeal magnet or fine-loop retractors; this broadened the operative field in the mesocolon by at least 2 points. The mesocolon was dissected with a medial to lateral approach. The suspended bar was tied to 2 fine-loop retractors and manipulated to enlarge the operative field in the mesocolon. The roots of the vascular pedicles were isolated and divided during lymph node dissection. After extracting the specimen, an anastomosis was performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Intra- and postoperative complications due to inadequate access were the primary outcomes measured. RESULTS There were no intraoperative complications and no need for conversions to open surgery or second access ports. The median total surgical time was 182 minutes (range, 122-245). Surgical blood loss was slight (range, 1-20 mL) in all patients. No postoperative complications occurred. The postoperative hospital stay was 5 to 7 days. LIMITATIONS The sample size was small. CONCLUSIONS This study showed that intracorporeal attachable and detachable instruments were safe and feasible for this procedure.","Uematsu, Dai; Magishi, Akiko; Sano, Takayuki; Niitsu, Hirokazu",Diseases of the colon and rectum,140,1

AIM To investigate the feasibility and safety of comparing two antimicrobial-impregnated discs to prevent CLABSI. METHODS A single-centre, parallel group, randomized controlled trial was conducted in a 929-bed tertiary referral hospital. Hospital inpatients requiring a peripherally inserted central catheter were randomized to chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) or polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) disc dressing group. Dressings were replaced every seven days, or earlier, if clinically required. Participants were followed until device removal or hospital discharge. Feasibility outcomes included: proportion of potentially eligible participants who were enrolled; proportion of protocol violations; and proportion of patients lost to follow-up. Clinical outcomes were: CLABSI incidence, diagnosed by a blinded infection control practitioner; all-cause bloodstream infection (BSI); and product-related adverse events. FINDINGS Of 143 patients screened, 101 (71%) were eligible. Five (3.5%) declined participation. There was one post-randomization exclusion. Two (2%) protocol violations occurred in the CHG group. No patients were lost to follow-up. Three (3%) BSIs occurred; two (2%) were confirmed CLABSIs (one in each group) and one a mucosal barrier injury-related BSI. A total of 1217 device-days were studied, resulting in 1.64 CLABSIs per 1000 catheter-days. One (1%) disc-related adverse event occurred in the CHG group.

OBJECTIVES To estimate the deficit number of CAN investigations and resultant estimated number of missed prevention and CAN cases due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. from March 2020 to December 2020. METHODS Secondary data analyses of administrative child welfare data from January 2013 to December 2020 from New York City, Florida, New Jersey and Wisconsin were conducted. Spline regression modeling controlling for autocorrelation was utilized to explore any significant changes once the pandemic began in March 2020 in the number of screened-in CAN investigations. The seven-year monthly average of screen-in CAN investigations for March through December from 2013 to 2019 was calculated and compared to the numbers of CAN investigations for March 2020 to December 2020. The resultant number of missed prevention cases and CAN cases was estimated for the four jurisdictions and used to approximate the number of missed prevention cases and CAN cases in the U.S., as well as the projected estimation of national lifetime economic costs. RESULTS Prior to the pandemic, there were insignificant monthly increases of 0.7 CAN investigations in NYC and 6.2 CAN investigations in Florida, a significant monthly increase 4.2 CAN investigations in New Jersey and an insignificant monthly decrease in 0.6 CAN investigations in Wisconsin. Once the pandemic began, there were significant monthly decreases (p < .001) in each of the four jurisdictions, including 1425.6 fewer CAN investigations in NYC, 3548.0 fewer CAN investigations in Florida, 963.0 fewer CAN investigations in New Jersey and 529.1 fewer CAN investigations in Wisconsin. There were an estimated 60,791 fewer CAN investigations in these four jurisdictions from March 2020 to December 2020 of which there were approximately 18,540 missed prevention and CAN cases suggesting up to $4.2 billion in lifetime economic costs. It was estimated that were 623,137 children not investigated for CAN in the U.S. during the same 10-month period. This suggests that there were an estimated 85,993 children were missed for prevention services and about 104,040 children were missed for CAN with a potential lifetime economic impact of up to $48.1 billion in the U.S. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a precipitous drop in CAN investigations where almost 200,000 children are estimated to have been missed for prevention services and CAN in a 10-month period. There are opportunities for the child welfare jurisdictions to work with partner education, public health, social service and other providers to strategically approach this very grave issue in order to mitigate its impact on this very vulnerable population.","Nguyen, Loc H",Child abuse & neglect,140,31

Therefore, centres had to develop remote and innovative ways to deliver the core components of CR during this shutdown. This increase in usage of remote rehabilitation services provides a chance to assess patients' experiences and willingness-to-pay of remote CR sessions. METHODS This was a prospective single-centre study. From 17 July 2020, to 19 August 2020, we conducted an anonymous survey about the patient experiences of the cardiac telerehabilitation services provided at Jessa Hospital Hasselt during the COVID-19 pandemic. A link to an electronic questionnaire was sent via email to 155 patients who were invited to participate in the cardiac telerehabilitation sessions during the closure of the rehabilitation centre due to COVID-19. RESULTS Fifty-five patients (35% of all invited patients) did participate in remote CR and completed the questionnaire. The mean age of the respondents was 65.4 ± 10.5 years, 63% were male and 70% of the participants were retired. A total of 91% possessed a smartphone and all those patients used their smartphone regularly to send text messages. Ninety-four per cent of the participants were satisfied with the provided telerehabilitation sessions and 70% of the participants would be prepared to pay for these sessions like for centre-based CR sessions. Twenty per cent of patients would even prefer the telerehabilitation sessions above centre-based CR sessions. CONCLUSION Most patients believed that remote CR could be an option after the COVID-19 pandemic when it is combined with centre-based CR sessions. Patients are willing to pay the same amount for a telerehabilitation session as a centre-based CR session. This demonstrates that highly motivated patients are open to shift certain parts of CR from face-to-face interactions to digital interactions.","Scherrenberg, Martijn; Falter, Maarten; Dendale, Paul",Acta cardiologica,140,1

The clinical and cost benefit of these materials are unknown. OBJECTIVES To review the published evidence on the use of biological mesh materials and to examine the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval history for these devices. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION Search of multiple electronic databases (Ovid, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database) to identify articles published between 1948 and June 30, 2015, on the use of biological mesh materials used to reinforce abdominal wall hernia repair. Keywords searched included surgical mesh, abdominal hernia, recurrence, infection, fistula, bioprosthesis, biocompatible materials, absorbable implants, dermis, and collagen. The FDA online database for 510(k) clearances was reviewed for all commercially available biological mesh materials. The median national price for mesh materials was established by a benchmarking query through several Integrated Delivery Network and Group Purchasing Organization tools. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS Of 274 screened articles, 20 met the search criteria. Most were case series that reported results of convenience samples of patients at single institutions with a variety of clinical problems. Only 3 of the 20 were comparative studies. There were no randomized clinical trials. In total, outcomes for 1033 patients were described. Studies varied widely in follow-up time, operative technique, meshes used, and patient selection criteria. Reported outcomes and clinical outcomes, such as fistula formation and infection, were inconsistently reported across studies. Conflicts of interest were not reported in 16 of the 20 studies. Recurrence rates ranged from 0% to 80%. All biological mesh devices were approved by the FDA based on substantial equivalence to a group of nonbiological predicate devices that, on average, were one-third less costly. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE There is insufficient evidence to determine the extra costs associated with or the clinical efficacy of biological mesh materials for the repair of abdominal wall hernia.","Huerta, Sergio; Varshney, Anubodh; Patel, Prachi M; Mayo, Helen G; Livingston, Edward H",JAMA surgery,140,16

The three mechanisms are: (1) The lateral ankle mechanism, an active modulation of ankle inversion/eversion in stance; (2) The foot placement mechanism, an active shift of the swing foot placement; and (3) The push-off mechanism, an active modulation of the ankle plantarflexion angle during double stance. Here we seek to determine whether there are changes in neural control of balance when walking at different cadences and speeds. Twenty-one healthy young adults walked on a self-paced treadmill while immersed in a 3D virtual reality cave, and periodically received balance perturbations (bipolar galvanic vestibular stimulation) eliciting a perceived fall to the side. Subjects were instructed to match two cadences specified by a metronome, 110 bpm (High) and 80 bpm (Low), which in this experiment, led to faster and slower gait speeds, respectively. The results indicate that subjects altered the use of the balance mechanisms at different cadences. The lateral ankle mechanism was used more in the Low condition, while the foot placement mechanism was used more in the High condition. There was no difference in the use of the push-off mechanism between cadence conditions. These results suggest that neural control of balance is altered when gait characteristics, such as cadence change, suggesting a flexible balance response that is sensitive to the constraints of the gait cycle. We speculate that the use of the balance mechanisms may be a factor resulting in well-known characteristics of gait in populations with compromised balance control, such as slower gait speed in older adults or higher cadence in people with Parkinson's disease.","Fettrow, Tyler; Reimann, Hendrik; Grenet, David; Crenshaw, Jeremy; Higginson, Jill; Jeka, John",Frontiers in sports and active living,140,19

Data were collected via an online survey tool. The data presented are part of a broader study that examined injury profiles, concussion reporting behaviors, and medical provision in BAF. Concussion-like symptoms were found in over half (58.8%) of the participants. Of those, 36.4% reported they had previously been formally diagnosed with a concussion while playing BAF. Just under half of the participants (44.7%) had suspected they had had a concussion, although it was not formally diagnosed, and 23.5% of the participants had previously hidden concussion symptoms. Fifty-eight percent of the teams reported they did not have a regular game-day medic, with a range of hired medical personnel who attended the games. Prominent barriers to hiring a medic included budget, institutional support shortfall, and lack of medic reliability and game knowledge. BAF is a developing sport with a clear vision for growth of participation. Yet, the current concussion and medical provision policies do not address the sport's welfare needs. Through discussion of these policies in the context of this study's findings, we highlight vital areas of concern in policy and practice that the British American Football Association needs to address in their medical and concussion policies.","Travis, Eleanor; Thornton, Claire; Scott-Bell, Andrea",Frontiers in sports and active living,140,1

Although all steps in the survey can contribute to the data quality parameters, data collection mechanisms seem the most determinant, as they can avoid mistakes before they happen. The use of electronic devices such as smartphones and tablet computers improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of public health surveys. However, there is lack of systematically analyzed evidence to show the potential impact on data quality and cost reduction of electronic-based data collection tools in interviewer-administered surveys. OBJECTIVE This systematic review aims to evaluate the impact of interviewer-administered electronic device data collection methods concerning data quality and cost reduction in population-level surveys compared with the traditional paper-based methods. METHODS We will conduct a systematic search on Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Global Health, Trip, ISI Web of Science, and Cochrane Library for studies from 2007 to 2018 to identify relevant studies. The review will include randomized and nonrandomized studies that examine data quality and cost reduction outcomes. Moreover, usability, user experience, and usage parameters from the same study will be summarized. Two independent authors will screen the title and abstract. A third author will mediate in cases of disagreement. If the studies are considered to be combinable with minimal heterogeneity, we will perform a meta-analysis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 126 patients aged from 22 to 83 years (27.8% of men) with ARVI or influenza that occurred with medical care during the first 5 days of the disease (60.3% in the first 48 hours) are included. All patients suffer from diabetes, for the treatment of which oral hypoglycemic agents or insulins were constantly taken. The patients were divided into two groups: the first group received standard symptomatic treatment of ARVI; antiviral drug Kagocel. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION Diabetes and other acute respiratory viral infections. There is an increase in the incidence of bacterial complications - 2.2 times, an increase in the frequency of systemic antibiotics - 2.3 times. The purpose of the drug prescription led to a more rapid regression of all the symptoms of influenza and ARVI, but the most striking positive dynamics was observed in the symptoms of general weakness and headache. The prescription of Kagocel was accompanied by a 58% reduction in the number of bacterial complications and a 53% reduction in the use of antibiotics, which led to a reduction in the number of cases of the disease and an improvement in initial diseases, with an frequency increase in 1.8 times.

Simultaneously, health system challenges underline the need for patient-centred, empowering and citizen-engaging care, which facilitates a focus on prevention and health promotion. Through enhanced patient-engagement, patient-provider interactions and reduced information gaps, electronic patient-generated health data (PGHD) may facilitate both patient-centeredness and preventive scare. Despite that, comprehensive knowledge syntheses on their utilisation for prevention and health promotion purposes are lacking. The review described in this protocol aims to fill that gap. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Our methodology is guided by Arksey and O' Malley's methodological framework for scoping reviews, as well as its advanced version by Levac, Colquhoun and O'Brien. Seven electronic databases will be systematically searched using predefined keywords. Key electronic journals will be hand searched, while reference lists of included documents and grey literature sources will be screened thoroughly. Two independent reviewers will complete study selection and data extraction. One of the team's senior research members will act as a third reviewer and make the final decision on disputed documents. We will include literature with a focus on electronic PGHD and linked to prevention and health promotion. Literature on prevention that is driven by existing discomfort or disability goes beyond the review's scope and will be excluded. Analysis will be narrative and guided by Shapiro et al's adapted framework on PGHD flow. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The scoping review described in this protocol aims to establish a baseline understanding of electronic PGHD generation, collection, communication, sharing, interpretation, utilisation, context and impact for preventive purposes. The chosen methodology is based on the use of publicly available information and does not require ethical approval. Review findings will be disseminated in digital health conferences and symposia. Results will be published and additionally shared with relevant local and national authorities.","Nittas, Vasileios; Mütsch, Margot; Ehrler, Frederic; Puhan, Milo Alan",BMJ open,140,19

In the London-Middlesex region of Ontario, a critical shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) was identified among primary care physicians (PCPs). Intervention With the help of the London-Middlesex Primary Care Alliance, volunteer administrators, physicians and medical students coordinated the acquisition and redistribution of community-donated PPE to PCPs across London-Middlesex. Our scope evolved to include PPE reusability and stewardship and PCP wellness. Outcome Beginning on March 16, 2020, our initial four-week operation provided PPE to over 200 PCPs. We received 60 donations, including over 118,000 gloves, 13,700 masks, 700 wellness kits and reusable cloth masks and gowns. Each delivery included educational pamphlets, and our online PPE stewardship session was attended by over 30 physicians. Implications In response to the PPE shortage in COVID-19, our efforts evolved into a complex adaptive system, supported by an organizational body with a pre-existing communication infrastructure, to great success. Our scope extended beyond simple PPE provision to PCPs. Furthermore, our initiative established a framework for a centralized response to PPE shortage in Ontario Health West.","Shah, Meera; Ho, Jordan; Zhong, Adrina; Fung, Matthew; Elia, Mario; Dang, Janet; Freeman, Thomas R",Healthcare quarterly,140,24

Therefore, we conducted a population-based study of 2.6 million Danish citizens investigating the occurrence and impact of COVID-19 in patients with liver cirrhosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS A prospective population-based cohort study was conducted in the Capital Region of Denmark and Region Zealand in the study period between 1 March 2020 up until 31 May 2020, with the only eligibility criteria being a reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for presence of viral genomic material confirming COVID-19. The patients were subsequently stratified according to presence of pre-existing liver cirrhosis. RESULTS Among 575,935 individuals tested, 1713 patients had a diagnosis of cirrhosis. COVID-19 occurredsignificantly lessamongpatients with cirrhosis (n = 15; 0.9%, p < .01) compared with the population without cirrhosis (n = 10,593; 1.8%). However, a large proportion (n = 6;40.0%) required a COVID-19 related hospitalization which was correlated with higher values of alanine aminotransferase (p < .01) and lactate dehydrogenase (p = .04). In addition, one-in-three (n = 2; 13.3%) required intensive therapy. Four patients died (26.7%) and mortality was associated with higher MELD scores, co-existing type 2 diabetes, and bacterial superinfections. CONCLUSION In conclusion, patientswith cirrhosis may have a lower risk of COVID-19; but a higher risk of complications hereto and mortality.","Attauabi, Mohamed; Burisch, Johan; Bendtsen, Flemming; Kimer, Nina",Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology,140,25

We report a consecutive series of 38 such patients with selective use of a fasciocutaneous V-Y buttock advancement flap (BAF). METHOD Data were collected on a series of patients undergoing ELAPE for rectal malignancy between August 2011 and July 2017. Demographics, management and outcomes were recorded prospectively. Perineal wound problems were considered as 'major' if they required packing; otherwise, they were classed as 'minor'. RESULTS Thirty-eight patients [eight female and 30 male; median age 63 (range: 35-89) years] underwent ELAPE. Thirty-seven had an adenocarcinoma of the rectum and one had a malignant melanoma. The median tumour height (from the anal verge) was 30 (range: 0-80) mm. Sixteen patients had a BAF. The median length of stay was 10 (range: 6-25) days. Primary perineal healing occurred in 18 (47%) patients. Major wound breakdown occurred in three (10%) patients and minor wound breakdown in 17 (45%). Two of the 16 patients having a BAF had major wound breakdown: one wound took 9 weeks to heal completely and the other took 9 months. Of the 22 patients who did not have a BAF, one had a major wound breakdown which closed by 3 months. There were no perineal fistulae or chronic sinuses. There were two perineal herniae that were successfully repaired by perineal insertion of biological mesh (Permacol™; Covidien, Dublin, Ireland). CONCLUSIONS Selective use of a BAF for perineal closure can give good results in terms of healing and an acceptably low early perineal herniation rate.","Barrie, J; Haque, A; Evans, D A",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,140,5

We examined the role of VCAM-1/α4β1 integrin interaction in T cell recruitment to prevent reactivation of the infection in the brain. SCID mice were infected and treated with sulfadiazine to establish a chronic infection. VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 were the endothelial adhesion molecules detected on cerebral vessels of the infected SCID and wild-type animals. Immune T cells from infected wild-type mice were treated with anti-α4 integrin or control antibodies and transferred into infected SCID or nude mice, and the animals received the same antibody every other day. Three days later, sulfadiazine was discontinued to initiate reactivation of infection. Expression of mRNAs for CD3δ, CD4, CD8β, gamma interferon (IFN-γ), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) (an effector molecule to inhibit T. gondii growth) and the numbers of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in the brain were significantly less in mice treated with anti-α4 integrin antibody than in those treated with control antibody at 3 days after sulfadiazine discontinuation. At 6 days after sulfadiazine discontinuation, cerebral tachyzoite-specific SAG1 mRNA levels and numbers of inflammatory foci associated with tachyzoites were markedly greater in anti-α4 integrin antibody-treated than in control antibody-treated animals, even though IFN-γ and NOS2 mRNA levels were higher in the former than in the latter. These results indicate that VCAM-1/α4β1 integrin interaction is crucial for prompt recruitment of immune T cells and induction of IFN-γ-mediated protective immune responses during the early stage of reactivation of chronic T. gondii infection to control tachyzoite growth.","Sa, Qila; Ochiai, Eri; Sengoku, Tomoko; Wilson, Melinda E; Brogli, Morgan; Crutcher, Stephen; Michie, Sara A; Xu, Baohui; Payne, Laura; Wang, Xisheng; Suzuki, Yasuhiro",Infection and immunity,140,28

These materials vary in characteristics such as mesh density, pore size, and pore shape. It is difficult to determine the impact of a single variable of interest due to other compounding variables in a particular design. Thus, the current study utilized prototype meshes designed to evaluate each of these mesh parameters individually. METHODS Five prototype meshes composed of planar, monofilament polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were evaluated in this study. The meshes were designed to focus on three key parameters, namely mesh density, pore size, and pore shape. The prototype meshes were implanted in the preperitoneal, retrorectus space in a porcine model of ventral incisional hernia repair, and tissue ingrowth characteristics were evaluated after 90 days. Mesh-tissue composite specimens were obtained from each repair site and evaluated via T-peel mechanical testing. Force-displacement data for each T-peel test were analyzed and five characteristics of tissue ingrowth reported: peak force (fp), critical force (fc), fracture energy (Γc), work (W), and work density (Wden). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections of explanted mesh-tissue composites were also assessed for characteristics of tissue response including cellular infiltration, cell types, inflammatory response, extracellular matrix deposition, neovascularization, and fibrosis, with a composite score assigned to represent overall tissue response. RESULTS The medium-weight, very large pore, hexagonal (MWVLH) mesh performed significantly better than the light-weight, medium pore, diamond (LWMD) mesh for all parameters evaluated (fp, fc, Γc, W, Wden) and trended toward better results than the medium-weight, medium pore, diamond (MWMD) mesh for the majority of the parameters evaluated. When the data for the five meshes was grouped to evaluate mesh density, pore size, and pore shape, differences were more pronounced. No significant differences were observed with respect to mesh density, however significant improvement in mechanical strength of tissue ingrowth occurred as pore size increased from medium to very large. In addition, the hexagonal pores resulted in the strongest tissue ingrowth, followed by the square pores, and finally the diamond pores. Scores for several histological parameters were significantly different for these prototype meshes. For example, the MWVLH mesh showed significantly greater tissue ingrowth by neovascularization histological score than MWMD and MWVLS meshes (p<0.05) and significantly less fibrosis than LWMD and MWVLS meshes (p<0.05). CONCLUSION Pore shape and pore size significantly altered the mechanical strength of tissue ingrowth and host-site integration in a porcine model of ventral hernia repair, while mesh density had no effect.","Lake, Spencer P; Ray, Shuddhadeb; Zihni, Ahmed M; Thompson, Dominic M; Gluckstein, Jeffrey; Deeken, Corey R",Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,140,32

Coronary angiography revealed ectatic coronary arteries with an occluded right coronary artery (RCA). The RCA had a massive thrombus burden that did not resolve with aspiration thrombectomy or balloon angioplasty. Subsequently, IC thrombolysis was administered resulting in significant reperfusion. During the course of his treatment, the patient suffered from intracranial bleeding as a complication; however, he recovered completely with no residual neurological sequelae.

OBJECTIVE To describe factors influencing physician practices' implementation of behavioral health integration. DESIGN Semistructured interviews with leaders and clinicians from physician practices that adopted behavioral health integration, supplemented by contextual interviews with experts and vendors in behavioral health integration. SETTING 30 physician practices, sampled for diversity on specialty, size, affiliation with parent organizations, geographic location, and behavioral health integration model (collaborative or co-located). PARTICIPANTS 47 physician practice leaders and clinicians, 20 experts, and 5 vendors. MEASUREMENTS Qualitative analysis (cyclical coding) of interview transcripts. RESULTS Four overarching factors affecting physician practices' implementation of behavioral health integration were identified. First, practices' motivations for integrating behavioral health care included expanding access to behavioral health services, improving other clinicians' abilities to respond to patients' behavioral health needs, and enhancing practice reputation. Second, practices tailored their implementation of behavioral health integration to local resources, financial incentives, and patient populations. Third, barriers to behavioral health integration included cultural differences and incomplete information flow between behavioral and nonbehavioral health clinicians and billing difficulties. Fourth, practices described the advantages and disadvantages of both fee-for-service and alternative payment models, and few reported positive financial returns. LIMITATION The practice sample was not nationally representative and excluded practices that did not implement or sustain behavioral health integration, potentially limiting generalizability. CONCLUSION Practices currently using behavioral health integration face cultural, informational, and financial barriers to implementing and sustaining behavioral health integration. Tailored, context-specific technical support to guide practices' implementation and payment models that improve the business case for practices may enhance the dissemination and long-term sustainability of behavioral health integration.

Research on nutrition and dietary components is challenging and controversies still persist about the role of many micro- and macronutrients and health outcomes in dementia. Importantly, results of preclinical investigations have shown that vitamin D triggers different neural pathways that may be protective against these neurodegenerative mechanisms, including the deposition of amyloid plaques, inflammatory processes, neurofibrillary degeneration, glutamatergic excitotoxicity, excessive intraneuronal calcium influx, and oxidative stress, although its relationship with AD still needs to be fully understood. AREAS COVERED The authors analyzed the recent evidence about the effects of vitamin D insufficiency on AD and the role of supplementation. EXPERT OPINION Both insufficient (25-49.9 ng/ml) and deficient levels (<25 ng/ml) of vitamin D may contribute to an increased susceptibility to AD. However, further well-designed prospective studies are needed for a better understanding of the involvement of low vitamin D concentrations in the AD natural history. Randomized clinical trials will also be necessary to address the issue of causality and determine whether vitamin D supplementation may be effective for the prevention or treatment of AD.","Panza, Francesco; La Montagna, Maddalena; Lampignano, Luisa; Zupo, Roberta; Bortone, Ilaria; Castellana, Fabio; Sardone, Rodolfo; Borraccino, Luisa; Dibello, Vittorio; Resta, Emanuela; Altamura, Mario; Daniele, Antonio; Lozupone, Madia",Expert review of neurotherapeutics,140,19

The aim of this study was to identify specific parameters suitable for measuring dressings' performance, and to recommend laboratory tests able to evaluate these specific criteria in an objective manner. METHOD After reviewing all tests currently used in Italy and examining the criteria for evaluating the quality of dressings, the authors selected 12 clinically significant parameters. These parameters were measured using standard and non-standard tests, and in some cases, these tests were modified and improved to simulate real-life conditions more accurately. RESULTS Most of the tests used were able to discriminate well between dressings belonging to different brands, with some tests being more suitable than others for the assessment of specific dressings. CONCLUSION These results highlighted some issues in the standard testing procedures, such as the need of a suitable fluid that mimics the real exudate, and the importance of standard temperature and humidity conditions during testing. Our study paves the way for a larger project aimed at a systematic evaluation of dressing quality able to assess every wound dressing on the market.","Mennini, N; Greco, A; Bellingeri, A; De Vita, F; Petrella, F",Journal of wound care,140,1

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (RV) species A, B and the more recently described species C are implicated in the majority of these presentations. However, the relative importance and age-specificities of these viruses have not been defined. Hence, this study aimed to establish these relationships in a large cohort of prospectively recruited hospitalized children. METHODS The study cohort was 390 children aged 0-16 years presenting with acute wheezing to a children's emergency department, 96.4% being admitted. A nonwheezing control population of 190 was also recruited. Nasal samples were analyzed for viruses. RESULTS For the first 6 months of life, RSV was the dominant virus associated with wheezing (P < 0.001). From 6 months to 2 years, RSV, RV-A and RV-C were all common but none predominated. From 2 to 6 years, RV-C was the dominant virus detected (50-60% of cases), 2-3 times more common than RV-A and RSV, RSV decreasing to be absent from 4 to 7 years. RV-B was rare at all ages. RV-C was no longer dominant in children more than 10 years of age. Overall, RV-C was associated with lower mean oxygen saturation than any other virus (P < 0.001). Controls had no clear age distribution of viruses. CONCLUSION This study establishes a clear profile of age specificity of virus infections causing moderate to severe wheezing in children: RSV as the dominant cause in the first 6 months and RV-C in preschool-age children.","Oo, Stephen W C; Khoo, Siew-Kim; Cox, Des W; Chidlow, Glenys; Franks, Kimberley; Prastanti, Franciska; Bochkov, Yury A; Borland, Meredith L; Zhang, Guicheng; Gern, James E; Smith, David W; Bizzintino, Joelene A; Laing, Ingrid A; Le Souëf, Peter N",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,140,1

Overinflation into the bronchial cuff causes damage to the tracheobronchial mucosa, whereas underinflation leads to an incomplete collapse of the nonventilated lung or incomplete ventilation of the ventilated lung. However, how to determine the appropriate bronchial cuff volume and pressure during OLV is unclear. The objective of this study is to compare the required bronchial cuff volume for lung separation obtained by 2 different cuff inflation methods under closed- and open-chest conditions. METHODS A total of 64 patients scheduled to undergo elective thoracic surgery requiring OLV were recruited. Left DLTs were used for both right- and left-sided surgery. The patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 inflation-type groups to estimate the bronchial cuff volume. In the capnogram waveform-guided bronchial cuff inflation group (capno group, n = 27), the bronchial cuff was inflated until a capnometer sampling gas containing CO2 from the nonventilated lung displayed a flat line. The corresponding bronchial cuff volume and pressure were then recorded. In the pressure-guided bronchial cuff inflation group (pressure group, n = 29), the bronchial cuff was inflated by a cuff inflator to a pressure of 20 cm H2O. Lung separation was confirmed when a flat line of a capnometer was observed after gas sampling from the nonventilated lung. RESULTS Under closed-chest conditions, the bronchial cuff sealing volume for the capno group was significantly lower than that for the pressure group (mean [standard deviation {SD}], 1.00 [0.65] mL vs 1.44 [0.59] mL, mean difference, - 0.44; 97.5% confidence interval [CI], -0.78 to - 0.11; P = .010). Under open-chest conditions, the bronchial cuff sealing volume for the capno group was also significantly lower than that for the pressure group (mean [SD], 0.65 [0.66] mL vs 1.22 [0.45] mL, mean difference, -0.58; 97.5% CI, -0.88 to -0.27; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS The lowest cuff volume providing an air-tight bronchial seal was obtained by the capnogram waveform-guided bronchial cuff inflation method. Since the cuff volume required to achieve an air-tight seal decreases after opening the chest, readjustment of the bronchial cuff volume to prevent bronchial cuff damage to the tracheobronchial mucosa after opening the chest may be advisable.","Yamada, Yuko; Tanabe, Kumiko; Nagase, Kiyoshi; Ishihara, Takuma; Iida, Hiroki",Anesthesia and analgesia,140,1

Modeling the spread and development of infectious diseases represented by new Coronavirus has become an important part of public health work in the world. Estimation of possible infection population and prospective suggestion of handling spread based on exist data are of crucial importance. Considering of the biology parameters obtained based on Chinese clinical data in Wuhan and real spread feature of 2019-nCov in Italy, we build a more applicable model called SEIJR with log-normal distributed time delay to forecast the trend of spreading. Adopting Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), we estimate the early period average spreading velocity (α0) and implement inversion analysis of time point (T0) when the virus first hit the Italy. Based on fixed α0 and T0, we then obtained the average spreading velocity α1 after the area lockdown using PSO. The result shows that it will be helpful in addressing the infection by generating the prediction trends of different αwhich we considered. Finally, our research applies Logistic regression, Neutral Network embedding LSTM layer, which are two representative machine learning algorithms, to directly predict future infection trend and compare the forecast with result yielded by mathematical model adopting differential equations. Not only solved the complex, nondifferentiable equation of epidemic model, this research also performs well in inversion analysis based on PSO which conveys informative outcomes for further discussion on precautious action. The comparison with the machine learning algorithms shows that the 2019-nCov based epidemic dynamics assumption is reasonable and helpful to mathematical model, which is better than the data driven machine learning algorithms.

Most of the published works indicate CQ/HCQ is likely effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection, almost 100% in prophylaxis and mildmedium severity cases and 60% in late infection cases. The percentage of positive works is larger if those works conducted under a probable conflict of interest are excluded from the list. Despite this overwhelming evidence from independent studies, the use of CQ/HCQ is currently limited or prevented in many western countries, based on a very singular examination of the science. The case of a work published in late May 2020, despite being openly defective and then retracted, prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to ban the use of CQ/HCQ. This position has not yet rectified, thanks to the results of the not less questionable RECOVERY trial, where very sick patients were administered more than double the dose, over more than double the time, recommended for asymptomatic patients in current protocols of other countries, where CQ/HCQ are used for asymptomatic and mild but not severe pneumonia critically ill patients. While the case fatality rate does not depend only on therapies, it is finally shown based on the number of cases and fatalities per million and the case fatality rate as the western countries enforcing the ban on CQ/HCQ did not perform better, but much worse, than other countries, also because of therapies. © 2021 Chemical Publishing Co..

These findings demonstrate the importance of proactive, strategic arbovirus surveillance in mosquito populations to prevent and control outbreaks, particularly when other illnesses (e.g., COVID-19), which present with similar symptoms are circulating concurrently. Growing evidence for substantial infection prevalence of dengue in competent mosquito vectors in the absence of local index cases suggests a higher level of dengue endemicity in Florida than previously thought.","Coatsworth, H.; Lippi, C.; Vasquez, C.; Ayers, J.

CLas is vectored by Diaphorina citri, and the understanding of the molecular interplay between vector and pathogen will provide additional basis for the development and implementation of successful management strategies. We focused in the molecular interplay occurring in the gut of the vector, a major barrier for CLas invasion and colonization. We investigated the differential expression of vector and CLas genes by analyzing a de novo reference metatranscriptome of the gut of adult psyllids fed of CLas-infected and healthy citrus plants for 1-2, 3-4 and 5-6 days. CLas regulates the immune response of the vector affecting the production of reactive species of oxygen and nitrogen, and the production of antimicrobial peptides. Moreover, CLas overexpressed peroxiredoxin in a protective manner. The major transcript involved in immune expression was related to melanization, a CLIP-domain serine protease we believe participates in the wounding of epithelial cells damaged during infection, which is supported by the down-regulation of pangolin. We also detected that CLas modulates the gut peristalsis of psyllids through the down-regulation of titin, reducing the elimination of CLas with faeces. The up-regulation of the neuromodulator arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase implies CLas also interferes with the double brain-gut communication circuitry of the vector. CLas colonizes the gut by expressing two Type IVb pilin flp genes and several chaperones that can also function as adhesins. We hypothesized biofil formation occurs by the expression of the cold shock protein of CLas. We also describe the interplay during cell invasion and modification, and propose mechanisms CLas uses to invade the host hemocel. We identified several specific targets for the development of strategies directed to interfere with the successful utilization of the psyllid vector by this pathogen. Author Summary Huanglongbing (HLB) or greening is an incurable disease causing severe damage to citrus production, making citrus industrial activity unsustainable in several countries around the world. HLB is caused by three species of Candidatus Liberibacter. Ca. L. asiaticus (CLas), vectored by the psyllid Diaphorina citri, is the prevalent species. Attempts to apply new technologies in the development of strategies for disease and pest management are been made. However, we still miss basic information on this system to efficiently apply the current technologies and envisage the implementation of new approaches for pest control, despite the relevant scientific contribution available. One major gap is regarded to the molecular interplay between CLas and its vector. We focused our attention in the molecular interplay occurring at the first relevant interaction of CLas and D. citri, represented by the gut barrier. We report the transcriptional activity of CLas during the invasion and establishment of the infection in the gut of the vector, as well as the transcriptional activity of the vector in response to the infection. We identified several host genes that are targeted and regulated by CLas as well as several CLas genes that are promising targets for the application of new management strategies.","de Moura Manoel Bento, Flavia; Cecília Darolt, Josiane; Laís Merlin, Bruna; Penã, Leandro; Wulff, Nelson Arno; Cônsoli, Fernando Luis",bioRxiv,140,33

It has emerged as the predominant 'world problematique'. Though entire populations are affected by climate change, women and girls suffer the most. Due to their traditional roles, women are heavily dependent on natural resources. As already seen, as a consequence of natural disasters and during Covid-19 pandemic in 2020-21, women have faced heightened real-life challenges specially being vulnerable to different forms of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). They suffer from a lack of protection, privacy, and mental trauma. Women are exposed to SGBV due to weak or absence of social, economic, political security and the culture of widespread impunity to the perpetrators. There is double victimization of women both as human beings and because of their gender. Effect of SGBV is highly injurious and perpetual. A close study of four main areas of international law does not yield any international legal instrument that deals with SGBV against women during and after the climate change induced disasters. This is more ominous when growing evidence suggests role of climate change in exacerbation of SGBV against women and girls. Even texts of the three specific climate change treaties (1992 UNFCCC, 1997 Kyoto Protocol and 2005 Paris Agreement) do not address this issue. It has been given attention only through the decisions of the Conference of the Parties in recent years. Due to serious psychological and bodily harm SGBV causes to women, it needs to be explicitly factored in respective international legal instruments on climate change and disasters. Amidst ignorance, denials and lack of adequate attention as regards impact of climate change in exacerbating SGBV against women and girls from the scholars and decision-makers in the field, this study makes a modest effort to deduce and analyze - from scattered initiatives, scholarly literature in different areas, existing international legal instruments and intergovernmental processes - the growing causal relationship between climate change and SGBV against women and girls so as to suggest a way out for our better common future.

We tested inhibition of host cell nucleotide synthesis as a promising strategy to decrease the replication of SARS-CoV-2-RNA, thus diminishing the formation of virus progeny. Methotrexate (MTX) is an established drug for cancer therapy and to induce immunosuppression. The drug inhibits dihydrofolate reductase and other enzymes required for the synthesis of nucleotides. Strikingly, the replication of SARS-CoV-2 was inhibited by MTX in therapeutic concentrations around 1 μM, leading to more than 1000-fold reductions in virus progeny in Vero C1008 (Vero E6) as well as Calu-3 cells. Virus replication was more sensitive to equivalent concentrations of MTX than of the established antiviral agent remdesivir. MTX strongly diminished the synthesis of viral structural proteins and the amount of released virus RNA. Virus replication and protein synthesis were rescued by folinic acid (leucovorin) and also by inosine, indicating that purine depletion is the principal mechanism that allows MTX to reduce virus RNA synthesis. The combination of MTX with remdesivir led to synergistic impairment of virus replication, even at 300 nM MTX. The use of MTX in treating SARS-CoV-2 infections still awaits further evaluation regarding toxicity and efficacy in infected organisms, rather than cultured cells. Within the frame of these caveats, however, our results raise the perspective of a two-fold benefit from repurposing MTX for treating COVID-19. Firstly, its previously known ability to reduce aberrant inflammatory responses might dampen respiratory distress. In addition, its direct antiviral activity described here would limit the dissemination of the virus. SIGNIFICANCE MTX is one of the earliest cancer drugs to be developed, giving rise to seven decades of clinical experience. It is on the World Health Organization’s List of Essential Medicines, can be administered orally or parenterally, and its costs are at single digit € or $ amounts/day for standard treatment. In case of its successful further preclinical evaluation for treating SARS-CoV-2 infections, its repurposing to treat COVID-19 would thus be feasible, especially under low-resource conditions. Additional drugs exist to interfere with the synthesis of nucleotides, e.g. additional folate antagonists, inhibitors of GMP synthetase, or inhibitors of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). Such inhibitors have been approved as drugs for different purposes and might represent further therapeutic options against infections with SARS-CoV-2 Remdesivir is currently the most established drug for treating COVID-19. Our results argue that MTX and remdesivir, even at moderate concentrations, can act in a synergistic fashion to repress virus replication to a considerably greater extent than either drug alone. COVID-19, in its severe forms, is characterized by pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and additional organ involvements. These manifestations are not necessarily a direct consequence of virus replication and cytopathic effects, but rather a result of an uncontrolled inflammatory and immune response. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as glucocorticoids are thus being evaluated for treating COVID-19. However, this bears the risk of re-activating virus spread by suppressing a sufficient and specific immune response. In this situation, it is tempting to speculate that MTX might suppress both excessive inflammation as well as virus replication at the same time, thus limiting both the pathogenesis of pneumonia and also the spread of virus within a patient.","Stegmann, Kim M.; Dickmanns, Antje; Gerber, Sabrina; Nikolova, Vella; Klemke, Luisa; Manzini, Valentina; Schlösser, Denise; Bierwirth, Cathrin; Freund, Julia; Sitte, Maren; Lugert, Raimond; Salinas, Gabriela; Görlich, Dirk; Wollnik, Bernd; Groß, Uwe; Dobbelstein, Matthias",bioRxiv,140,24

Materials and Methods: The chemical constituents of HSYF extract were characterized using UPLC-Q-TOF/MS. Subsequently, a set of TCM network pharmacology methods was applied to identify disease-associated genes and to predict target profiles and pharmacological actions associated with the constituents of HSYF. Then, the antiviral effects of HSYF on H1N1 were assessed in RAW264.7 cells using MTT assays. Expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α following infection of RAW264.7 cells with H1N1 were measured using an enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA), and expression levels of inflammatory-related factors were detected using western blotting. Results: In total, 165 chemical constituents (including glycosides, tannins, volatile oils, amino acids, triterpenoids, polyphenols, phenylpropanoids, sesquiterpenes, alkaloids, and flavonoids, among others) were tentatively identified in HSYF. Network pharmacology demonstrated that HSYF can regulate immunomodulatory- and anti-inflammatory-related targets of multiple pathways through its active ingredients, suggesting potential anti-COVID-19 effects. Furthermore, cell viability assays and ELISA showed that HSYF significantly inhibited H1N1 replication in RAW64.7 cells and markedly reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 at the proteins level.

Previous studies have found that infectious illness presenteeism could contribute to outbreaks in occupational settings and identified multiple occupational and organizational risk factors. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to investigate presenteeism particularly in relation to respiratory infectious disease (RID). Hence, this rapid review aims to determine the prevalence of RID-related presenteeism, including COVID-19, and examines the reported reasons and associated risk factors. Methods: The review followed a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) search approach and focused on studies published in English and Chinese. Database searches included MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database (CNKI) and preprint databases MedRxiv and BioRxiv. Results: The search yielded 54 studies, of which four investigated COVID-19-related presenteeism. Prevalence of work presenteeism ranged from 14.1% to 55% for confirmed RID, and 6.6% to 100% for those working with suspected or subclinical RID. The included studies demonstrated that RID-related presenteeism is associated with occupation, sick pay policy, age, gender, health behaviour and perception, vaccination and organisational factors including workplace culture and peer pressure. Conclusions: This review demonstrates that presenteeism or non-adherence to isolation guidance is a real concern and can contribute to workplace transmissions and outbreaks. Policies which would support workers financially and improve productivity, should include a range of effective non-pharmaceutical inventions such as workplace testing, promoting occupational health services, reviewing pay and bonus schemes and clear messaging to encourage workers to stay at home when ill. Future research should focus on the more vulnerable and precarious occupational groups, and their inter-relationships, to develop comprehensive intervention programs to reduce RID-related presenteeism.","Daniels, S.; Wei, H.; Han, Y.; Catt, H.; Denning, D.

With nanobodies against an Ebola virus secreted glycoprotein (sGP) and a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) as targets, Nano2RED showed a high sensitivity (limit of detection of ∼10 pg/mL for sGP and ∼40 pg/mL for RBD in diluted human serum), a high specificity, and a large dynamic range (∼7 logs). Unlike conventional assays where slow mass transport for surface binding limits the assay time, Nano2RED features fast antigen diffusion at micrometer scale, and can be accelerated to deliver results within a few minutes. The rapid detection, low material cost (estimated < $0.01 per test), inexpensive and portable readout system (< $5 and < 100 cm3), and digital data output, make Nano2RED particularly suitable for screening of patient samples with simplified operation and accelerated data transmission. Our method is widely applicable for prototyping diagnostic assays for other antigens from new emerging viruses.","Chen, Xiahui; Kang, Shoukai; Ikbal, Ashif; Zhao, Zhi; Pan, Yuxin; Zuo, Jiawei; Gu, Liangcai; Wang, Chao",bioRxiv,140,11

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 directed cellular immune responses may be deleterious or may confer immune protection – more research is needed in order to link epitope-specific T-cell responses with clinically relevant endpoints.1 Analysis of epitope reactivity in blood from healthy individuals showed pre-existing (CD4+) reactivity most likely due to previous exposure to the common old coronavirus species HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, - NL63 or HKU1, or – not mutually exclusive - cross-reactive T-cell responses that would recognize SARS-CoV-2, yet also other non-SARS-CoV-2 targets.2,3 Detailed single cell analysis in PBMCs from patients with COVID-19 showed strong T-cell activation and expansion of TCR gamma – delta T-cells in patients with fast recovery or mild clinical symptoms.4 Previous studies examining antigen-specific T-cell responses in tumor-infiltrating T-cells (TIL) showed that EBV or CMV-specific cellular immune responses in TIL from patients with melanoma or pancreatic cancer. Such virus -specific T-cells may represent ‘bystander’ T-cell activation, yet they may also impact on the quality and quantity of anti-tumor directed immune responses. We tested therefore TIL expanded from 5 patients with gastrointestinal cancer, who underwent elective tumor surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic for recognition of a comprehensive panel of SARS-CoV-2 T-cell epitopes and compared the reactivity, defined by IFN-gamma production to TIL reactivity in TIL harvested from patients in 2018, prior to the pandemic.MethodsA set of 187 individual T-cell epitopes were tested for TIL recognition using 100IU IL-2 and 100 IU IL-15. Different peptide epitopes were selected: i) all epitopes were not shared with the 4 common old coronavirus species, ii) some peptides were unique for SARS-CoV-2, and iii) others were shared with SARS-CoV-1. Antigen targets were either 15 mers or 9mers for MHC class II or class I epitopes, respectively, derived from the nucleocapsid, membrane, spike protein, ORF8 or the ORF3a. The amount of IFN-gamma production was reported as pg/10e4 cells/epitope/5 days. Controls included CMV and EBV peptides.ResultsWe detected strong IFN-gamma production directed against antigenic ‘hotspots’ including the ORF3a, epitopes from the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and spike protein with a range of 12 up to 30 targets being recognized/TIL.ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 epitope recognition, defined by IFN production, can be readily detected in TIL from patients who underwent surgery during the pandemic, which is not the case for TIL harvested prior to the circulating SARS-CoV-2. This suggests a broader exposure of individuals to SARS-CoV-2 and shows that SARS-CoV-2 responses may shape the quality and quantity of anti-cancer directed cellular immune responses in patients with solid epithelial malignancies.AcknowledgementsWe thank the Surgery, Pathology and Vivarium Units of Champalimaud Clinical Center (N.

In clinics in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) and Western Cape (WC) provinces, South Africa, we estimated clinic visit duration, time spent indoors and outdoors, and occupancy density of waiting rooms. Methods We used unique barcodes to track attendees' movements in 11 clinics in two provinces, multiple imputation to estimate missing arrival and departure times, and mixed-effects linear regression to examine associations with visit duration. Results 2,903 attendees were included. Median visit duration was 2 hours 36 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] 01:36-3:43). Longer mean visit times were associated with being female (13.5 minutes longer; p<0.001) and attending with a baby (18.8 minutes longer; p<0.01), and shorter mean times with later arrival (14.9 minutes shorter per hour after 0700; p<0.001) and attendance for tuberculosis or ante/postnatal care (24.8 and 32.6 minutes shorter, respectively, than HIV/acute care; p<0.01). Overall, attendees spent more of their time indoors (median 95.6% [IQR 46-100]) than outdoors (2.5% [IQR 0-35]). Attendees at clinics with outdoor waiting areas spent a greater proportion (median 13.7% [IQR 1-75]) of their time outdoors. In two clinics in KZN (no appointment system), occupancy densities of ~2.0 persons/m2 were observed in smaller waiting rooms during busy periods. In one clinic in WC (appointment system), occupancy density did not exceed 1.0 persons/m2 despite higher overall attendance. Conclusions Longer waiting times were associated with early arrival, being female, and attending with a young child. Attendees generally waited where they were asked to. Regular estimation of occupancy density (as patient flow proxy) may help staff assess for risk of infection transmission and guide intervention to reduce time spent in risky spaces.","Karat, A.

As institutions continue to adapt to the impacts of the current public health crisis, colleges and universities are also navigating federal policy prompted by the pandemic. Literature has shown the positive influence of organizations, such as the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP), and, we argue that they can take a more active intermediary approach, that of an Organizational Buffer, to best support their students during times of uncertainty. Current research highlights the disconnect between STEM education and policy, as well as how the pandemic is disproportionately impacting communities of color. The pervasiveness of whiteness within educational policy and the negative impacts of unequal distribution of resources on students of color in STEM highlight the need to center race in a theoretical framework and policy. The purpose of this study was to understand the policy and communication responses to the pandemic as they pertained to supporting student success in STEM. Using the Theory of Racialized Organizations, which is a qualitative case study approach that leverages diffractive readings, was implemented to understand whether educational policy and communication responses during this time have or perpetuated inequitable systems. Guided by the research question, in what ways do pandemic policies and communications bolster the success of underrepresented minoritized students (URM) majoring in STEM, our study found four versions of policymaking (i.e., Performative, Picking Winners and Losers, Stay in your Lane, and Time Burden) that emerged and did not support URM STEM students equitably and consistently. Based on these findings, we present implications for institutional responses, LSAMP-alliance support, and future research. © Copyright © 2021 Morgan, Callais, Acevedo and Davis.","Morgan, D.

Both proteins contain a single transmembrane-spanning segment but are integrated in the membrane with opposite orientations. The G protein has an amino-terminal signal sequence and a stop-transfer sequence located near the carboxy terminus. The HN glycoprotein has a single sequence near the amino terminus that functions as both a signal- sequence and a transmembrane-spanning segment. Membrane insertion was explored using a cell-free system directed by transcribed mRNAs encoding amino-terminal segments of the two proteins. Ribosome-bound nascent polypeptides were assembled, ribonucleotides were removed by gel filtration chromatography, and the ribosomes were incubated with microsomal membranes under conditions of defined ribonucleotide content. Nascent chain insertion into the membrane required the presence of both the signal recognition particle and a functional signal recognition particle receptor. In the absence of ribonucleotides, insertion of nascent membrane proteins was not detected. GTP or nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues promoted efficient insertion, while ATP was comparatively ineffective. Surprisingly, the majority of the HN nascent chain remained ribosome associated after puromycin treatment. Ribosome-associated HN nascent chains remained competent for membrane insertion, while free HN chains were not competent. We conclude that a GTP binding protein performs an essential function during ribosome-dependent insertion of membrane proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum that is unrelated to protein synthesis.",,J Cell Biol,140,1

However, the high expression of active hEGF in Escherichia coli has not been successful, as the protein contains three intra-molecular disulfide bonds that are difficult to form correctly in the bacterial intracellular environment. To solve this problem, we fused the hEGF gene with a small ubiquitin-related modifier gene (SUMO) by synthesizing an artificial SUMO-hEGF fusion gene that was highly expressed in Origami (DE3) strain. The optimal expression level of the soluble fusion protein, SUMO-hEGF, was up to 38.9% of the total cellular protein. The fusion protein was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and cleaved by a SUMO-specific protease to obtain the native hEGF, which was further purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The result of the reverse-phase HPLC showed that the purity of the recombinant cleaved hEGF was greater than 98%. The primary structure of the purified hEGF was confirmed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing and MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy analysis. Using the method of methylthiazoletetrazolium, the mitogenic activity on Balb/c 3T3 cells of the purified hEGF was comparable to that of commercial hEGF.","Su, Zhijian; Huang, Yadong; Zhou, Quannan; Wu, Zhiling; Wu, Xiaoping; Zheng, Qing; Ding, Changcai; Li, Xiaokun",Protein and peptide letters,140,7

RESULTS Local health departments provided little in the way of training in biologic, chemical, or radiological terrorism to responders (7.4%-14.9%). State health departments provided even less training (6.3%-17.3%) on all topics to emergency medical services providers. Training that was provided by the health department in bioterrorism and public health emergency response was associated with responder comfort in responding to a bioterrorism event (OR = 2.74, 95% CI = 2.68, 2.81).

Patients were considered eligible if they were independent prior to stroke and had proximal intracranial arterial occlusion. RESULTS Three hundred and twelve patients [136 women, mean (SD) age of 64 (17) years] from 11 district health boards have been treated between March 2011 and April 2018. There were 260 (83%) patients with anterior and 52 (17%) with posterior circulation arterial occlusion. One hundred and ninety-three (62%) patients were pre-treated with intravenous alteplase. The median time from symptom onset to groin puncture was 210 (range 65-985) minutes.

Although very promising in theory, these tests have raised many questions. This article is a rapid review that synthesizes data regarding different types of available RDTs, their performance, their limits and their potential indications in Tunisia as proposed by a multidisciplinary group of experts. METHODS A literature review was carried out on the websites of international organizations, governmental bodies and on INAHTA database, completed by a search of relevant scientific articles up to 1 June 2020. The synthesis of the data was submitted to a panel of experts to propose recommendations for the Tunisian context. RESULTS RDTs based on the detection of antigens and antibodies have sensitivity and specificity related issues. Few validation reports are published in the scientific literature. Pending more evidence on their performance and validity, several international organizations recommend their use only for research purposes. TDRs based on antibody detection are not appropriate for the early diagnosis of COVID-19. However, validated and specific tests could provide complementary diagnostic information to reference tests.

METHODS The study estimated the utilisation of resources related to infection control, SARS related medical services, and routine medical services, and SARS related medical outcomes at National Cheng Kung University Hospital (NCKUH) from 25 March to 16 June 2003 through a cross sectional survey of hospital records. RESULTS A mean of 5100 persons per day (95%CI 4580 to 5610) underwent fever screening at the outpatient and emergency department (ED) entrances to the hospital, of which 35 per day (95% CI 30 to 40) were referred for further evaluation for suspected or probable SARS. ED isolation surge capacity was created via 12 new beds outside the ED: eight for SARS assessment, three for patients awaiting in hospital bed assignment, and one for resuscitation. A total of 382 patients were fully evaluated for suspected or probable SARS outside the ED, of which 27 were admitted. The mean numbers of outpatient clinic patient visits, ED visits, ED trauma patient visits, ED admissions, hospital admissions, and operative procedures decreased during the outbreak. Thirty eight patients were hospitalised with suspected SARS, of which three received the final diagnosis of probable SARS. Two patients with probable SARS died. No cases of nosocomial SARS transmission occurred. CONCLUSIONS This SARS outbreak was associated with substantial use of hospital and ED resources aimed at infection control, comparatively less use of resources related to the medical care of patients with suspected or probable SARS, and decreased use of routine medical services.","Tsai, M C; Arnold, J L; Chuang, C C; Chi, C H; Liu, C C; Yang, Y J",Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,140,28

EVIDENCE ACQUISITION We have performed a literature search for articles in PubMed, EMBASE and Google Scholar databases till May 12, 2020, with following keywords: ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""HLH"", ""HScore"", ""coagulopathy"", ""D-dimer"", ""cytokine storm"", ""children"" and ""pediatrics"" with interposition of Boolean operator ""AND"". RESULTS Children presenting with moderate-severe COVID-19 and Kawasaki disease shock-like syndrome exhibit peripheral blood picture analogous to HLH. HScore, a validated tool to diagnose HLH, has been suggested to screen severe COVID-19 patients for cytokine storm. However, HScore faces certain limitations in this scenario. It may be more pragmatic to use 'high D-dimer' (> 3 µg/mL) instead of 'low fibrinogen' to facilitate early detection of cytokine storm. COVID-19 associated coagulopathy resembles hypercoagulable form of DIC with bleeding being rarely reported. Although the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) interim guidance recommends low molecular weight heparin in all hospitalized patients, data is lacking in population below 14 years of age. However, in the presence of life-threatening thromboembolic event or symptomatic acro-ischemia, unfractionated heparin (UFH) should be used with caution. CONCLUSION HScore can be used as a complement to clinical decision for initiating immunosuppression.

Reconstitution of both full length Vpu(1-81) and a short, the transmembrane (TM) domain comprising peptide Vpu(1-32) into bilayers under a constant electric field results in an asymmetric orientation of those channels. For both cases, channel activity with similar kinetics is observed. Channels can open and remain open within a broad series of conductance states even if a small or no electric potential is applied. The mean open time for Vpu peptide channels is voltage-independent. The rate of channel opening shows a biphasic voltage activation, implicating that the gating is influenced by the interaction of the dipole moments of the TM helices with an electric field.","Mehnert, T; Lam, Y H; Judge, P J; Routh, A; Fischer, D; Watts, A; Fischer, W B",Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,140,1

The aim of this study was to determining the differences in the humoral immune parameters, serum ACTH and cortisol levels existing between sportswomen and sedentary subjects and the effect of acute aerobic and anaerobic exercise on these parameters. MATERIALS/METHODS 40 sportswomen (Groups 1 and 2) and 20 sedentary women (Group 3) were enrolled and Group 1 performed aerobic exercise on a treadmill for 30 minutes while the Group 2 was subjected to the Wingate effort test for 30 seconds. Before exercising (at 8.30 a.m), immediately after the exercise, and 4 hours, days 2 and 5 days after exercising blood samples were obtained and the levels of IgA, IgG, IgM, complement 3 (C3) and complement 4 (C4) were determined turbidometrically. RESULTS Before exercise: the means of IgA and IgG values in the G1 and G2 groups were higher than the Group G3, and the mean cortisol levels in the sedentary group was significantly higher (p<0.05). After Exercise: Whereas the C3 and C4 levels decreased significantly at the end of the exercise in Group 1 and 2 (p<0.05), the IgA, IgG (p<0.05) and IgM levels (p<0.01) at the 4th and 5th determinations were observed to be significantly higher in only the Group 1. The cortisol and ACTH levels were found to have increased significantly (p<0.05) in the Group 1. In Group 2, no changes were observed in the IgA, IgG and IgM levels. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that regular and moderate exercise has favorable effects on the immune system by increasing immunoglobulins which are potent protective factors.","Karacabey, Kursat; Saygin, Ozcan; Ozmerdivenli, Recep; Zorba, Erdal; Godekmerdan, Ahmet; Bulut, Vedat",Neuro endocrinology letters,140,20

Typical symptoms included fever, cough and dyspnea, and not much was known about the clinical evolution of the disease. Herein, we report a case of a late complication of COVID-19 infection in a 41-year-old female. The patient presented with a 4-day history of myalgia, low fever, rhinorrhea and loss of smell. COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The patient recovered with conservative treatment, and PCR for COVID-19 turned negative after 5 weeks. However, at 4 weeks after the beginning of the viral symptoms, the patient developed severe arthralgia of some interphalangeal joints of the hands, that lasted for 4 weeks. Laboratory workup revealed no significant changes, and the symptoms resolved with a short course of oral steroids.

This study aimed to provide insights on dental hygienists' employment patterns as well as their attitudes toward working as dental hygienists during a pandemic.Methods: Licensed dental hygienists were invited to participate in a web-based 30-question survey between September 29 and October 8, 2020. Employment questions included current and pre-pandemic work status, reasons for not currently working as a dental hygienist, and estimated levels of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the primary work location. All statistical analysis was conducted in Qualtrics Core XM; cross tabulation was used to examine dental hygienist working patterns and attitudes by age, practice PPE supply, and other factors.Results: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an estimated 8% reduction in dental hygienist employment. The majority (59.1%, n=205) of this reduction is voluntary, with the main reason being general concerns over COVID-19 (48.3%, n=100). Other reasons include issues surrounding childcare and concerns over safety measures in the workplace. Dental hygienists aged 65 and older were most likely to have left the workforce voluntarily. More than half of respondents reported that their work locations had more than a two-week supply of most PPE items, although about 10% did not know supply levels. Dental hygienists working in settings with lower supplies of PPE were more concerned with COVID-19 transmission risk to themselves or to patients.Conclusion: COVID-19 has led to a reduction in the dental hygienist workforce that is likely to persist until the pandemic passes.The dental hygienist labor market has tightened and employers may continue to experience difficulties in filling vacant dental hygienist positions until the pandemic subsides. There is also likely to be a longer term, yet smaller, impact on dental hygiene employment levels.","Gurenlian, JoAnn R; Morrissey, Rachel; Estrich, Cameron G; Battrell, Ann; Bessner, Sue K; Lynch, Ann; Mikkelsen, Matthew; Araujo, Marcelo W B; Vujicic, Marko",Journal of dental hygiene : JDH,140,20

The purpose of this study was to determine the distinctions among patients with COVID-19 by comparing the imaging findings of patients with suspected confirmed COVID-19 and those of patients initially suspected to have COVID-19 who were ultimately negative for the disease. METHODS: 28 isolated suspected in-patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in this retrospective study from January 22, 2020 to February 6, 2020. 12 patients were confirmed to have positive severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA results, and 16 patients had negative results. The thin-section CT imaging findings and clinical and laboratory data of all the patients were evaluated. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the 12 confirmed COVID-19 (SARS-Cov-2-positive) patients and 16 SARS-CoV-2-negative patients in epidemiology and most of the clinical features or laboratory data. The CT images showed that the incidence of pure/mixed ground-glass opacities (GGOs) was not different between COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2-negative patients [9/12 (75.0%) vs 10/16 (62.5%), p = 0.687], but pure/mixed GGOs in the peripheral were more common in patients with COVID-19 [11/12 (91.7%) vs 6/16 (37.5%), p = 0.006]. There were no significant differences in the number of lesions, bilateral lung involvement, large irregular/patchy opacities, rounded opacities, linear opacities, crazy-paving patterns, halo signs, interlobular septal thickening or air bronchograms. CONCLUSIONS: Although peripheral pure/mixed GGOs on CT may help distinguish patients with COVID-19 from clinically suspected but negative patients, CT cannot replace RT-PCR testing. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Peripheral pure/mixed GGOs on-chest CT findings can be helpful in distinguishing patients with COVID-19 from those with clinically suspected COVID-19 but subsequently found to be COVID-19 negative.","Xie, Sidong; Lei, Ziying; Chen, Xiuzhen; Liu, Weimin; Wang, Xiaohong; Dong, Yunxu; Guo, Yuefei; Duan, Yani; Cao, Huijuan; Qin, Jie; Lin, Bingliang",Br J Radiol,140,16

The report by the World Health Organization (WHO) Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China supports person-to-person droplet and fomite transmission during close unprotected contact with the vast majority of the investigated infection clusters occurring within families, with a household secondary attack rate varying between 3 and 10%, a finding that is not consistent with airborne transmission. The reproduction number (R0) for the SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be between 2.2-2.7, compatible with other respiratory viruses associated with a droplet/contact mode of transmission and very different than an airborne virus like measles with a R0 widely cited to be between 12 and 18. Based on the scientific evidence accumulated to date, our view is that SARS-CoV-2 is not spread by the airborne route to any significant extent and the use of particulate respirators offers no advantage over medical masks as a component of personal protective equipment for the routine care of patients with COVID-19 in the health care setting. Moreover, prolonged use of particulate respirators may result in unintended harms. In conjunction with appropriate hand hygiene, personal protective equipment (PPE) used by health care workers caring for patients with COVID-19 must be used with attention to detail and precision of execution to prevent lapses in adherence and active failures in the donning and doffing of the PPE.","Conly, John; Seto, W H; Pittet, Didier; Holmes, Alison; Chu, May; Hunter, Paul R",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,140,32

Fifty-five of the 152 patients had previously tested positive by RT-PCR, while the remaining 97 did not have significant symptoms and had not been previously tested by RT-PCR. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 23.4% in the 975 patients tested by either RT-PCR or SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Older patients and patients with higher serum creatinine levels were more likely diagnosed by RT-PCR compared to SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Sixty-nine RT-PCR positive patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies at a median of 44 days post-diagnosis (Inter Quartile Range 31-58) and 80% were positive. Overall mortality was 20.5% but significantly higher (37.8%) in the patients who required hospitalization. Twenty-three percent of the hospitalized patients required kidney replacement therapy and 6.3% lost their allografts. In multivariable analysis, older age, receipt of deceased-donor transplantation, lack of influenza vaccination in the previous year and higher serum interleukine-6 levels were associated with mortality. Thus, 42% of patients with a kidney transplant and with COVID-19 were diagnosed on antibody testing without significant clinical symptoms; 80% of patients with positive RT-PCR developed SARS-CoV-2 IgG and mortality was high among patients requiring hospitalization.","Azzi, Yorg; Parides, Michael; Alani, Omar; Loarte-Campos, Pablo; Bartash, Rachel; Forest, Stefanie; Colovai, Adriana; Ajaimy, Maria; Liriano-Ward, Luz; Pynadath, Cindy; Graham, Jay; Le, Marie; Greenstein, Stuart; Rocca, Juan; Kinkhabwala, Milan; Akalin, Enver",Kidney Int,140,1

Hallmark symptom is a chronic airway infection due to mucostasis leading to irreversible lung damage that may progress to respiratory failure. There is no cure for this genetic disease and evidence-based treatment is limited. Until recently, there were no randomized controlled trials performed in PCD, but this year, data of the first placebo-controlled trial on pharmacotherapy in PCD were published. This cornerstone in the management of PCD was decisive for reviewing currently used treatment strategies. This article is a consensus of patient representatives and clinicians, which are highly experienced in care of PCD-patients and provides an overview of the management of PCD. Treatments are mainly based on expert opinions, personal experiences, or are deduced from other lung diseases, notably cystic fibrosis (CF), COPD or bronchiectasis. Most strategies focus on routine airway clearance and treatment of recurrent respiratory tract infections. Non-respiratory symptoms are treated organ specific. To generate further evidence-based knowledge, other projects are under way, e.âg. the International PCD-Registry. Participating in patient registries facilitates access to clinical and research studies and strengthens networks between centers.

METHODS: Using reportable disease data at Public Health Ontario, we conducted a population-based cross-sectional study comparing demographic, exposure, and clinical variables between HCWs and non-HCWs with SARS-CoV-2 infections as of 30 September 2020. We calculated rates of infections over time and determined the frequency of within household transmissions using natural language processing based on residential address. We evaluated the risk of death using a multivariable logistic regression model adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, symptoms, and long-term care home exposure. RESULTS: There were 7,050 (12.5%) HCW SARS-CoV-2 infections in Ontario, Canada, of whom 24.9% were nurses, 2.3% were physicians, and the remaining 72.8% other specialties, including personal support workers. Overall HCWs had an infection rate of 1,276 per 100,000 compared to non-HCWs of 346 per 100,000 (3.7 times higher). This difference decreased from a 7 times higher rate in April to no difference in September 2020. Twenty-six percent of HCWs had a household member with SARS-CoV-2 infection; 6.8% were probable acquisitions, 12.3% secondary transmissions, and 6.9% unknown direction of transmission. Death among HCWs was 0.2% compared to 6.1% of non-HCWs. The risk of death in HCWs remained significantly lower than non-HCWs after adjustment (adjusted odds ratio 0.09; 95%CI 0.05-0.17). CONCLUSION: HCWs represent a disproportionate number of diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infections in Ontario, however this discrepancy is at least partially explained by limitations in testing earlier in the pandemic for non-HCWs. We observed a low risk of death in HCWs which could not be completely explained by other factors.","Schwartz, Kevin L; Achonu, Camille; Buchan, Sarah A; Brown, Kevin A; Lee, Brenda; Whelan, Michael; Wu, Julie Hc; Garber, Gary",PLoS One,140,20

Our approach builds on the use of coloured stochastic and continuous Petri nets facilitating the sound component-based extension of basic SIR models to include population stratification and also spatio-geographic information and travel connections, represented as graphs, resulting in robust stratified pandemic metapopulation models. This method is inherently easy to use, producing scalable and reusable models with a high degree of clarity and accessibility which can be read either in a deterministic or stochastic paradigm. Our method is supported by a publicly available platform PetriNuts; it enables the visual construction and editing of models; deterministic, stochastic and hybrid simulation as well as structural and behavioural analysis.

Critical care nurses play a pivotal role in developing models of care that are effective, flexible, and safe. OBJECTIVES: We report on the accelerated development of a critical care nursing surge model responsive to escalating needs for intensive care capacity. METHODS: We conducted an exploratory prospective observational cohort study that included (i) a self-assessment and survey of learning needs of noncritical care nurses identified as candidate groups for redeployment in the intensive care unit and (ii) a pilot implementation of a team nursing model evaluated by individual questionnaires and the conduct of focus groups. We used descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis to analyse the exploratory findings. RESULTS: We surveyed 147 noncritical care nurses; 99 (67.3%) self-assessed at the lowest level of critical care competency, whereas 33 (24.3%) reported feeling able to help care for a critically ill patient under the direction of a critical care nurse. Identified learning needs included appropriate use of personal protective equipment in the intensive care unit (n = 123, 83.7%), use of specialised equipment (n = 103, 85.1%), basic mechanical ventilation, and vasoactive medication. We completed 11 team nursing pilot assignments with dyads of critical care and noncritical care nurses categorised in tiers of competencies. Nurses reported high levels of perceived support and provision of safe care; multiple recommendations were identified to improve the model of care delivery and communication. CONCLUSIONS: The complexity, acuity, and unpredictability of the COVID-19 pandemic is placing new demands on critical care nurses to modify existing processes for care delivery while ensuring excellent outcomes and professional satisfaction. The study findings provide a road map to support nursing engagement in meeting patient needs.","Lauck, Sandra B; Bains, Vininder K; Nordby, Dione; Iacoe, Emma; Forman, Jacqueline; Polderman, Jopie; Farina, Lena",Aust. crit. care,140,33

(Special Issue: SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.),11.9413,9.655746,2020,"BACKGROUND: Air pollution exposure and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) cause a poor prognosis after SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the underlying mechanisms are not well explored. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) are the keys to the entry of SARS-CoV-2. We therefore hypothesized that air pollution exposure and IPF may increase the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the lung alveolar region. We measured their expression levels in lung tissues of control non-IPF and IPF patients, and used murine animal models to study the deterioration of IPF caused by particulate matter (PM) and the molecular pathways involved in the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. RESULTS: In non-IPF patients, cells expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were limited to human alveolar cells. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were largely upregulated in IPF patients, and were co-expressed by fibroblast specific protein 1 (FSP-1) + lung fibroblasts in human pulmonary fibrotic tissue. In animal models, PM exposure increased the severity of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were also expressed in FSP-1+ lung fibroblasts in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and when combined with PM exposure, they were further upregulated. The severity of pulmonary fibrosis and the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 caused by PM exposure were blocked by deletion of KC, a murine homologue of IL-8, or treatment with reparixin, an inhibitor of IL-8 receptors CXCR1/2. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggested that risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease severity increased by air pollution exposure and underlying IPF. It can be mediated through upregulating ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in pulmonary fibroblasts, and prevented by blocking the IL-8/CXCR1/2 pathway.","Li, Hsin-Hsien; Liu, Chen-Chi; Hsu, Tien-Wei; Lin, Jiun-Han; Hsu, Jyuan-Wei; Li, Anna Fen-Yau; Yeh, Yi-Chen; Hung, Shih-Chieh; Hsu, Han-Shui",Part Fibre Toxicol,140,1

METHODS: A nonrandomized comparative case series study was performed. Six patients received thalidomide 100 mg per day (with therapy lasting for &#8805;7 days) plus low-dose short-term dexamethasone, and 6 control patients matched with patients in the thalidomide group, received low-dose short-term treatment with dexamethasone alone. The main outcomes were: the duration of SARS-CoV-2 negative conversion from admission; length of hospital stay; and changes in inflammatory cytokine concentrations and lymphocyte subsets. RESULTS: The median thalidomide treatment time was 12.0 days. The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 negative conversion from admission and hospital stay length were briefer in the thalidomide group compared to the control group (respectively, 11.0 vs 23.0 days, P = 0.043; 18.5 vs 30.0 days, P = 0.043). The mean reduction rates at 7-10 days after treatment for serum interleukin-6 and interferon-Î³ concentrations were greater in the thalidomide group compared to the control group. Alterations in lymphocyte numbers in the subsets between the 2 groups were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Thalidomide plus short-term glucocorticoid therapy is an effective and safe regimen for the treatment of severely ill COVID-19 patients.

The guidance coming from multiple sources frequently has been difficult to assimilate as well as dynamic, with constantly changing standards. We seek to communicate the current guidelines published by each state, to discuss the impact of these guidelines on orthopaedic surgery, and to provide the general framework used to determine which procedures have been postponed at our institution. METHODS: An internet search was used to identify published state guidelines regarding the cancellation of elective procedures, with a publication cutoff of March 24, 2020, 5:00 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time. Data collected included the number of states providing guidance to cancel elective procedures and which states provided specific guidance in determining which procedures should continue being performed as well as to orthopaedic-specific guidance. RESULTS: Thirty states published guidance regarding the discontinuation of elective procedures, and 16 states provided a definition of ""elective"" procedures or specific guidance for determining which procedures should continue to be performed. Only 5 states provided guidelines specifically mentioning orthopaedic surgery; of those, 4 states explicitly allowed for trauma-related procedures and 4 states provided guidance against performing arthroplasty. Ten states provided guidelines allowing for the continuation of oncological procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Few states have published guidelines specific to orthopaedic surgery during the COVID-19 outbreak, leaving hospital systems and surgeons with the responsibility of balancing the benefits of surgery with the risks to public health.","Sarac, Nikolas J; Sarac, Benjamin A; Schoenbrunner, Anna R; Janis, Jeffrey E; Harrison, Ryan K; Phieffer, Laura S; Quatman, Carmen E; Ly, Thuan V",J Bone Joint Surg Am,140,32

However, the more significant concentrations of infectious or potentially infectious biological materials can create a safety risk. The current short report describes the first attempt to identify the published scientific works on biobanking and safety. Three broad thematic areas have been identified: the physical security relevant to staff and sample integrity, the data safety aspects, and the governance parameters relating to the previous two. While the current publications reflect a broad alignment with existing standards and best practices in the biobanking field, they also demonstrate an opportunity for further in-depth work on this field in the post-COVID-19 era.","Roux, Julie; Zeghidi, Maissa; Villar, Stephanie; Kozlakidis, Zisis",,140,1

They contain general rules that should be considered in all situations. At present, during pandemic, some waste disposal practices are under evaluation to guarantee safety conditions. For example, in view of the recent results reporting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in sewage sludge, the possibility that it diffuses in the environment is alarming. The situation may result critical in densely populated cities, which are the largest sources of sewage sludge. In this frame the diffused practice of reuse of this waste in agriculture is under revision. In this context, incineration may represent a valuable alternative strategy to manage sewage sludge during pandemic. Indeed, due to thermal treatment, the destruction of organic micropollutants and pathogens, eventually present in the waste, is guarantee. Moreover, it is fundamental to highlight that also if the management of sewage sludge changes, the ash resulting from its combustion may have suitable reuse opportunities, and their landfilling should be avoided. This work presents the available possibilities of sewage sludge ash recovery in building applications and shows the results obtained by the analysis of their sustainability. The approach is based on the use of embodied energy and carbon footprint values, to make a simple and fast new method able to be a suitable tool to support and promote sustainability also in critical situations (such as pandemic) and when all the information about a technology are not available, making not possible to perform a full-LCA approach. This work aims to be not only a reference paper for promotion of strategies able to increase waste management safety, but also an example showing that circular economy principles should be pursued also if boundary conditions can change.","Ducoli, S; Zacco, A; Bontempi, E",J Environ Manage,140,20

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In May the 6th 2020 we performed a review of the literature through online search engines (PubMed, Web of Science and Science Direct). We looked at recommendations provided by the EAU and ERUS regarding the management of urological patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. The main aspects of interest were: the definition of deferrable and non-deferrable procedures, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and hospital protocols for health care providers, triage, hospitalization and surgery, post-operative care training and residents' activity. A narrative summary of guidelines and current literature for each point of interest was performed. CONCLUSION: In the actual Covid-19 scenario, while the number of positive patients globally keep on rising, it is fundamental to embrace a new way to deliver healthcare and to overcome challenges of physical distancing and self-isolation. The use of appropriate PPE, definite pathways to access the hospital, the implementation of telemedicine protocols can represent effective strategies to carry on delivering healthcare.","Esperto, Francesco; Prata, Francesco; Civitella, Angelo; Pang, Karl H; Marchioni, Michele; Tuzzolo, Piergiorgio; Scarpa, Roberto M; Papalia, Rocco",Int Braz J Urol,140,1

We report here a phase I/II trial of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and pembrolizumab. METHODS: This single-center, open-label phase I/II study recruited adults with LS-SCLC or other neuroendocrine tumors and good performance status (ECOG &#8804;2). The primary endpoint was safety, as assessed by dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Concurrent CRT consisted of etoposide and a platin with 45 Gy radiotherapy (30 BID). Prophylactic cranial irradiation (25 Gy, 10 fractions) was given at the physician's discretion. Pembrolizumab was started concurrently with CRT and continued for up to 16 cycles. The phase I portion consisted of a 3+3 design. Toxicity was assessed with CTCAE v4.0. Secondary outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and tumor response as measured by the IRRC. RESULTS: Forty-five patients were screened and 40 were enrolled. All completed RT and received &#8805;1 cycle of pembrolizumab. Twenty-seven (61%) received PCI. One DLT was observed in the phase I portion. There were no grade 5 toxicities, and three grade 4 events (2 neutropenia, 1 respiratory failure). The pneumonitis rate was 15% (three grade 2 and three grade 3). All 17 (42.5%) esophagitis events were grades 1-2. At median follow-up time of 23.1 months, the median PFS time was 19.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.8â30.5) and median OS time was 39.5 months (95% CI 8.0â71.0).

Timely epidemiological surveillance is essential for outbreak response, but is complicated by a high proportion of silent (non-symptomatic) infections and limited testing resources. METHODS: We used a stochastic, individual-based model to simulate transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) along detailed inter-individual contact networks describing patient-staff interactions in a real LTCF setting. We simulated distribution of nasopharyngeal swabs and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests using clinical and demographic indications and evaluated the efficacy and resource-efficiency of a range of surveillance strategies, including group testing (sample pooling) and testing cascades, which couple (i) testing for multiple indications (symptoms, admission) with (ii) random daily testing. RESULTS: In the baseline scenario, randomly introducing a silent SARS-CoV-2 infection into a 170-bed LTCF led to large outbreaks, with a cumulative 86 (95% uncertainty interval 6-224) infections after 3 weeks of unmitigated transmission. Efficacy of symptom-based screening was limited by lags to symptom onset and silent asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission. Across scenarios, testing upon admission detected just 34-66% of patients infected upon LTCF entry, and also missed potential introductions from staff. Random daily testing was more effective when targeting patients than staff, but was overall an inefficient use of limited resources. At high testing capacity (> 10 tests/100 beds/day), cascades were most effective, with a 19-36% probability of detecting outbreaks prior to any nosocomial transmission, and 26-46% prior to first onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Conversely, at low capacity (< 2 tests/100 beds/day), group testing strategies detected outbreaks earliest. Pooling randomly selected patients in a daily group test was most likely to detect outbreaks prior to first symptom onset (16-27%), while pooling patients and staff expressing any COVID-like symptoms was the most efficient means to improve surveillance given resource limitations, compared to the reference requiring only 6-9 additional tests and 11-28 additional swabs to detect outbreaks 1-6 days earlier, prior to an additional 11-22 infections. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 surveillance is challenged by delayed or absent clinical symptoms and imperfect diagnostic sensitivity of standard RT-PCR tests. In our analysis, group testing was the most effective and efficient COVID-19 surveillance strategy for resource-limited LTCFs. Testing cascades were even more effective given ample testing resources. Increasing testing capacity and updating surveillance protocols accordingly could facilitate earlier detection of emerging outbreaks, informing a need for urgent intervention in settings with ongoing nosocomial transmission.","Smith, David R M; Duval, Audrey; Pouwels, Koen B; Guillemot, Didier; Fernandes, Jérôme; Huynh, Bich-Tram; Temime, Laura; Opatowski, Lulla",BMC Med,140,20

We followed the PRISMA protocol and conducted a literature search using Google Scholar, EMBASE, PubMed, and Clinical trail.gov. The initial search yielded 2102 articles. We included 20 cohorts based on inclusion criteria reporting an association between CKD and COVID-19 after excluding irrelevant articles, including review articles and duplicates. We conducted pooled prevalence of CKD and meta-analysis to estimate the odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI) using Cochrane RevMan (version 5.4, Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration), and R programming language version 4.16-2 (University of Auckland, New Zealand). Our study involved 4350 patients from different countries, and 212 (4.9%) patients had CKD. Among 20 cohorts, 57.27% were male with a median age of 55.5 years. Eight hundred sixty-six patients developed severe COVID-19, and out of which, 39 (4.5%) were CKD patients.

Therefore, it is desirable to establish a backward diffusion model which implements a smart stabilisation approach that can be used in combination with a simple numerical scheme. We derive a class of space-discrete one-dimensional backward diffusion as gradient descent of energies where we gain stability by imposing range constraints. Interestingly, these energies are even convex.

The outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has exerted a negative impact on dental practices. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to analyze the nature and diffusion of COVID-19-related oral health information on the Chinese social media site Weibo. METHODS: A total of 15,900 tweets related to oral health and dentistry information from Weibo during the COVID-19 outbreak in China (December 31, 2019, to March 16, 2020) were included in our study. Two researchers coded 1000 of the total tweets in advance, and two main thematic categories with eight subtypes were refined. The included tweets were analyzed over time and geographic region, and coded into eight thematic categories. Additionally, the time distributions of tweets containing information about dental services, needs of dental treatment, and home oral care during the COVID-19 epidemic were further analyzed. RESULTS: People reacted rapidly to the emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 threat to dental services, and a large amount of COVID-19-related oral health information was tweeted on Weibo. The time and geographic distribution of tweets shared similarities with epidemiological data of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Tweets containing home oral care and dental services content were the most frequently exchanged information (n=4803/15,900, 30.20% and n=4478, 28.16%, respectively). Significant differences of public attention were found between various types of bloggers in dental services-related tweets (P<.001), and the tweets from the government and media engaged the most public attention. The distributions of tweets containing information about dental services, needs of dental treatment, and home oral care information dynamically changed with time. CONCLUSIONS: Our study overviewed and analyzed social media data on the dental services and oral health information during the COVID-19 epidemic, thus, providing insights for government organizations, media, and dental professionals to better facilitate oral health communication and efficiently shape public concern through social media when routine dental services are unavailable during an unprecedented event. The study of the nature and distribution of social media can serve as a useful adjunct tool to help make public health policies.","Tao, Zhuo-Ying; Chu, Guang; McGrath, Colman; Hua, Fang; Leung, Yiu Yan; Yang, Wei-Fa; Su, Yu-Xiong",J Med Internet Res,140,24

Previous literature suggests that human contact and attachment is a key for well-being which is why punishments like solitary confinement in detention centers like jail has always been debated as being torturous (Wolfendal 2020). With this notion, anxiety and stress may become more prevalent in individuals who experience self-isolation or are under a forced lockdown. For health-care workers like doctors and psychologists, who advocate for physical health, mental health and wellbeing; the challenges might increase during the pandemic phase as they are expected to go through the crises just like others while simultaneously contributing in rendering services related to dealing with physical and psychological health issues present in patients and clients with their continued practice from either on-site or online platforms. Although all health care professional's training inoculates the ill effects of compassion fatigue by other's overwhelming situations and discussions but they might still be prone to vicarious burnout, trauma and stress. Hence, they may become exposed to being at risk of experiencing anxiety more than the general population. This review discusses facets of the importance of self-care as mental health first aid tool for health care professionals including doctors and psychologists using research and supportive techniques to help them process stress and anxiety during and after the global pandemic.","Waris Nawaz, Maria; Imtiaz, Shumaila; Kausar, Erum",Psychiatr Danub,140,1

Forgery of normal patients' medical data to present them as COVID-19 patients is an illegitimate action that has been carried out in different ways recently. Therefore, the integrity of these data can be questionable. Forgery detection is a method of detecting an anomaly in manipulated forged data. An appropriate number of features are needed to identify an anomaly as either forged or non-forged data in order to find distortion or tampering in the original data. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have contributed a major breakthrough in this type of detection. There has been much interest from both the clinicians and the AI community in the possibility of widespread usage of artificial neural networks for quick diagnosis using medical data for early COVID-19 patient screening. The purpose of this paper is to detect forgery in COVID-19 medical data by using CNN in the error level analysis (ELA) by verifying the noise pattern in the data. The proposed improved ELA method is evaluated using a type of data splicing forgery and sigmoid and ReLU phenomenon schemes. The proposed method is verified by manipulating COVID-19 data using different types of forgeries and then applying the proposed CNN model to the data to detect the data tampering. The results show that the accuracy of the proposed CNN model on the test COVID-19 data is approximately 92%. © 2021 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.","Gill, S. H.; Sheikh, N.

METHODS: Forty-five healthy participants accepted twirling, lifting-thrusting, and twirling plus lifting-thrusting manipulanions at right Zusanli (ST 36), respectively. The acupuncturist's and participants' Deqi sensations were collected by MGH Acupuncture Sensation Scale (MASS). The intensity and occurrence rate of soreness, dull pain, pressure, heaviness, fullness, numbness, sharp pain, warmth, coolness, and throbbing feelings of participants, and tightness, smooth, and tangle feelings of acupuncturist were measured. The correlation between the acupuncturist's and participant's Deqi sensations was analyzed. Surface electromyogram (EMG) were recorded before, during and after needling in 30 participants. The integrated EMG (iEMG), mean power frequency (MPF) and media frequency (MF) were analyzed. RESULT: Both fullness and soreness of participants and tightness of acupuncturist were the most frequently occurred ones. A positive correlation between participants' fullness and acupuncturist's tightness was observed during the three aforementioned needling manipulations (P<0.05, OR>1). Almost all the needling sensations measured in the present study could be induced by the three needling manipulations. However, strength of Deqi sensations was exhibited as lifting-thrusting > twirling plus lifting-thrusting > twirling according to MASS index. The iEMG values were increased and MPF, MF values were decreased during needling compaired to those before needling, especially during lifting-thrusting (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The intensity and occurrence rate of the different Deqi sensations induced by different needling manipulations were basically similar. The fullness and soreness were both the most frequently induced Deqi sensations. The strongest Deqi sensation could be induced by lifting-thrusting manipulation. There is a positive correlation between participants' fullness and acupuncturist's tightness during the three needling manipulations. The myoelectricity around the acupoint is related to Deqi responses.

Obese breast cancer patients have at least a 30% increased risk of death from breast cancer compared to non-obese breast cancer patients because they present with larger tumors and generally have increased rates of metastasis. Moreover, obese breast cancer patients respond more poorly to treatment compared to non-obese patients, particularly pre-menopausal women diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). To help understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the increased metastasis associated with obesity, we previously established a three-dimensional culture system that permits the co-culture of adipocytes and TNBC cells in a manner that mimics an in vivo milieu. Using this system, we demonstrate that white adipose tissue from both lean and obese mice can induce a partial mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). Triple negative breast cancer cells adopt an epithelial morphology and have an increased expression of some epithelial markers, but they maintain the expression of mesenchymal markers, furnishing the breast cancer cells with hybrid properties that are associated with more aggressive tumors. Thus, these data suggest that adipose tissue has the potential to promote secondary tumor formation in lean and obese women. Further work is needed to determine if targeting the partial MET induced by adipose tissue could reduce metastasis.","Asante, Emmanuel C; Pallegar, Nikitha K; Hoffmann, Alica J; Viloria-Petit, Alicia M; Christian, Sherri L",,140,24

In fact, it has seriously affected people's mental health. The purpose of this study is to understand the psychological stress among college students in different stages of epidemics in hard-hit areas such as Hubei. Moreover, to highlight the factors that influencing, their psychological conditions with the emphasis of further corresponding suggestions. Methods: This study includes self-designed questionnaires in order to assess and analyze the psychological state of over 17,000 college students during the outbreak period in January and home quarantine in February. The questionnaire contains three aspects and six dimensions: pressure responses: stress susceptibility (SS), stress adjustment (SA), risk cognition: cognition of danger (CD), cognition of illness (CI) and stress reactions: emotional responses (ER), somatic responses (SR). This survey was done by an online questionnaire (www.wjx.cn) to investigate the psychological stress information of college students, and analyzed the data by SPSS 22.0 for Windows. Results: Regarding the stress susceptibility, participants were more likely stressed in February than in January. Regarding the stress adjustment, the number of participants requiring pressure regulation or release in the February survey was significantly lower than that the effective in the January survey. The mean of the cognition of danger reduced significantly in February than in January, in other words, participants were highly worried about the epidemic in January than in February. Regarding the cognition of illness, participants in January had a more pessimistic attitude towards the epidemic than those in February. The emotional responses of the participants in February were more severe than those in January, while the somatic responses reduced significantly in February compared with January. Furthermore, females have stronger stress reactions than males. However, the SR doesn't have significant differences between females and males. Conclusion: After two surveys in January and February, it was found that the psychological stress of college students in Hubei were significantly different at different stages of the epidemic, where the epidemic developped, the psychological stress of college students become more severe. The psychological stress of the college students in Hubei Province, as a severely affected area, should be paid more attention.","Zhang, Yan; Cao, Xiaochen; Xie, Yufei; Zhong, Qiongyao; Lei, Guanghui; Zhang, Jingyuan; Xiao, Qiang; Wang, Guixiang; Bian, Yueran; Xie, Simiao; Huang, Fei",Child Youth Serv Rev,140,16

Adequate prevention strategies are necessary to guarantee HCWs' safety, as well as to prevent dissemination of the infection among patients. AIMS: To describe a case series of SARS-CoV-2-positive HCWs in a large public healthcare organization in Milan (Italy) during the most devastating weeks of the epidemic and analyse the sources, symptoms and duration of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: This study included 172 SARS-CoV-2-positive HCWs who were infected between the 25th of February and the 7th of April 2020. A nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and RT-PCR were used to indicate. RESULTS: Initially, the most common sources of infection were other positive HCWs (49%). Medical doctors and nursing assistants were most frequently infected, with infection rates of 53/1000 and 50/1000, respectively. COVID-19 departments were less affected than internal medicine, surgery, intensive care, or emergency room. The most commonly reported symptom was mild cough, while loss of smell (anosmia) and loss of taste (ageusia) were reported as moderate and severe by 30-40% of HCWs. The time necessary for 50% of workers to recover from the infection was 23 days, while it took 41 days for 95% of HCWs to become virus-free. CONCLUSIONS: HCWs are commonly infected due to close contacts with other positive HCWs, and non-COVID departments were most affected. Most HCWs were asymptomatic or subclinical but contact tracing and testing of asymptomatic HCWs help identify and isolate infected workers.","Mandic-Rajcevic, S; Masci, F; Crespi, E; Franchetti, S; Longo, A; Bollina, I; Velocci, S; Amorosi, A; Baldelli, R; Boselli, L; Negroni, L; Zà, A; Orfeo, N V; Ortisi, G; Centanni, S; Colosio, C",Occup. med,140,16

Meanwhile, we are also experiencing an infodemic induced by the overabundance of information, some accurate and some inaccurate, spreading rapidly across social media platforms. Social media has arguably shifted the information acquisition and dissemination of a considerably large population of internet users toward higher interactivities. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate COVID-19-related health beliefs on one of the mainstream social media platforms, Twitter, as well as potential impacting factors associated with fluctuations in health beliefs on social media. METHODS: We used COVID-19-related posts from the mainstream social media platform Twitter to monitor health beliefs. A total of 92,687,660 tweets corresponding to 8,967,986 unique users from January 6 to June 21, 2020, were retrieved. To quantify health beliefs, we employed the health belief model (HBM) with four core constructs: perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers. We utilized natural language processing and machine learning techniques to automate the process of judging the conformity of each tweet with each of the four HBM constructs. A total of 5000 tweets were manually annotated for training the machine learning architectures. RESULTS: The machine learning classifiers yielded areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves over 0.86 for the classification of all four HBM constructs. Our analyses revealed a basic reproduction number R0 of 7.62 for trends in the number of Twitter users posting health belief-related content over the study period. The fluctuations in the number of health belief-related tweets could reflect dynamics in case and death statistics, systematic interventions, and public events. Specifically, we observed that scientific events, such as scientific publications, and nonscientific events, such as politicians' speeches, were comparable in their ability to influence health belief trends on social media through a Kruskal-Wallis test (P=.78 and P=.92 for perceived benefits and perceived barriers, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: As an analogy of the classic epidemiology model where an infection is considered to be spreading in a population with an R0 greater than 1, we found that the number of users tweeting about COVID-19 health beliefs was amplifying in an epidemic manner and could partially intensify the infodemic. It is ""unhealthy"" that both scientific and nonscientific events constitute no disparity in impacting the health belief trends on Twitter, since nonscientific events, such as politicians' speeches, might not be endorsed by substantial evidence and could sometimes be misleading.","Wang, Hanyin; Li, Yikuan; Hutch, Meghan; Naidech, Andrew; Luo, Yuan",J Med Internet Res,140,21

Most of the SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia published data came from hospitalised patients. This study set out to describe clinical characteristics of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia diagnosed in primary care across age groups and type of pneumonia. METHODS: Observational retrospective study obtaining clinical data from the electronic health records of patients who were followed-up by SARS-CoV-2 possible infection in a primary care practice in Madrid. All the cases were collected by in-person or remote consultation during the 10th March to the 7th of April. EXPOSURE: Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia by chest X-ray ordered by the GP. Main outcomes and measures: Symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, physical examination and diagnostic tests as a blood test, nasopharyngeal swab results for RT-PCR (Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) and chest X-ray results. RESULTS: The overall SARS-CoV-2 pneumonias collected were 172 (female 87 [50.6%], mean age 60.5 years standard deviation [SD] 17.0). Comorbidities were body mass index &gt;= 25 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (90 [52.3%]), hypertension (83 [48.3%]), dyslipidaemia (68 [39.5%]) and diabetes (33 [19.2%]).

Conventional confirmatory testing include skin tests and, for a few drugs, quantification of drug-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. However, none of these tests are absolutely predictive for the clinical outcome, and can yield false-negative and false-positive results. We performed a proof-of-concept study to assess whether a mast cell activation test could improve diagnosis of IgE-mediated chlorhexidine hypersensitivity, a common cause of perioperative anaphylaxis. METHODS: Human mast cells were generated from CD34+ progenitor cells and sensitised with patients' sera to become IgE+ human mast cells (dMCIgE+), and then incubated with chlorhexidine to assess degranulation. We compared the diagnostic performance of this mast cell activation test with serum from patients with and without positive skin test and basophil activation test to chlorhexidine. RESULTS: In dMC sensitised with sera from patients with a positive skin test and basophil activation test to chlorhexidine showed drug-specific and concentration-dependent degranulation upon stimulation with chlorhexidine, determined by surface upregulation of the degranulation marker CD63. In contrast, dMC sensitised with sera from patients with a negative skin test and basophil activation test to chlorhexidine were unresponsive in the mast cell activation test. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the mast cell activation test can be used to diagnose IgE/FcÎµRI-dependent immediate drug hypersensitivity reactions. It also shows potential to assess the clinical relevance of drug-specific IgE antibodies in their ability to elicit mast cell degranulation, and therefore discriminate between allergy and sensitisation. Extended studies are required to verify whether this technique can be used in other causes of perioperative anaphylaxis.","Elst, Jessy; van der Poorten, Marie-Line M; Faber, Margaretha A; Van Gasse, Athina L; Garvey, Lene H; Bridts, Chris H; De Puysseleyr, Leander P; Mertens, Christel; Hagendorens, Margo M; Sabato, Vito; Ebo, Didier G",Br. j. anaesth,140,3

The aim of the present study was to assess the safety and potential benefits of human recombinant C1 esterase inhibitor (conestat alfa), a complement, contact activation and kallikrein-kinin system regulator, in severe COVID-19. Patients with evidence of progressive disease after 24 h including an oxygen saturation <93% at rest in ambient air were included at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland in April 2020.

Five patients (age range, 53-85 years; one woman) with severe COVID-19 pneumonia (11-39% lung involvement on computed tomography scan of the chest) were treated a median of 1 day (range 1-7 days) after admission. Treatment was well-tolerated. Immediate defervescence occurred, and inflammatory markers and oxygen supplementation decreased or stabilized in 4 patients (e.g., median C-reactive protein 203 (range 31-235) mg/L before vs. 32 (12-72) mg/L on day 5). Only one patient required mechanical ventilation. All patients recovered. C1INH concentrations were elevated before conestat alfa treatment. Levels of complement activation products declined after treatment. Viral loads in nasopharyngeal swabs declined in 4 patients. In this uncontrolled case series, targeting multiple inflammatory cascades by conestat alfa was safe and associated with clinical improvements in the majority of severe COVID-19 patients.

To understand the effect of SADS-CoV on host cells, we characterized the apoptotic pathways and elucidated mechanisms underlying the process of apoptotic cell death after SADS-CoV infection. SADS-CoV-infected cells showed evidence of apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. The use of a pan-caspase inhibitor resulted in the inhibition of SADS-CoV-induced apoptosis and reduction in SADS-CoV replication, suggestive of the association of a caspase-dependent pathway. Furthermore, SADS-CoV infection activated the initiators caspase-8 and -9 and upregulated FasL and Bid cleavage, demonstrating a crosstalk between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. However, the proapoptotic proteins Bax and Cytochrome c (Cyt c) relocalized to the mitochondria and cytoplasm, respectively, after infection by SADS-CoV. Moreover, Vero E6 and IPI-2I cells treated with cyclosporin A (CsA), an inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening, were completely protected from SADS-CoV-induced apoptosis and viral replication, suggesting the involvement of cyclophilin D (CypD) in these processes. Altogether, our results indicate that caspase-dependent FasL (extrinsic)- and mitochondria (intrinsic)- mediated apoptotic pathways play a central role in SADS-CoV-induced apoptosis that facilitates viral replication. In summary, these findings demonstrate mechanisms by which SADS-CoV induces apoptosis and improve our understanding of SADS-CoV pathogenesis.","Zhang, Jiyu; Han, Yuru; Shi, Hongyan; Chen, Jianfei; Zhang, Xin; Wang, Xiaobo; Zhou, Ling; Liu, Jianbo; Zhang, Jialin; Ji, Zhaoyang; Jing, Zhaoyang; Ma, Jingyun; Shi, Da; Feng, Li",Emerg Microbes Infect,140,20

These limitations make these studies unsuitable for determining how to use new metrics such as acute workload, chronic workload, and their ratio for reducing injury risk. The main overarching concerns are the lack of a conceptual framework and reference models that do not allow for appropriate interpretation of the results to define a causal structure. The lack of any conceptual framework also gives investigators too many degrees of freedom, which can dramatically increase the risk of false discoveries and confirmation bias by forcing the interpretation of results toward common beliefs and accepted training principles. Specifically, we underline methodologic concerns relating to (1) measure of exposures, (2) pitfalls of using ratios, (3) training-load measures, (4) time windows, (5) discretization and reference category, (6) injury definitions, (7) unclear analyses, (8) sample size and generalizability, (9) missing data, and (10) standards and quality of reporting.

These instruments come in contact with the human tissues, being necessary 3D printed materials free of pathogenic microbes or other contaminants. Therefore, they must be sterilized to avoid that bacteria can attach to the surface and produce biofilm. With the aim of avoiding bacterial biofilm formation and minimize the health risks, acrylic acid (AcAc) coatings applied by plasma-polymerization have been deposited on 3D printed polylactic acid (PLA) Petri dishes. Six antimicrobial-resistant clinical and two susceptible control strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus species were analyzed. AcAc coatings provide the surface with greater hydrophilicity and, consequently, the formation of a hydration layer, whose thickness is related to the surface roughness. This hydration layer could explain the reduction of bacterial attachment and, consequently, the biofilm formation. Antibiofilm coatings are more successful against P. aeruginosa strains than against S. aureus ones; due to some coatings presents a smaller topography scale than the P. aeruginosa length, reducting the contact area between the bacteria and the coating, and causing a potential rupture of the cellular membrane. AcAc coatings with less number of plasma passes were more effective, and showed up to a 50% relative biofilm reduction (in six of the eight strains studied) compared with the untreated plates.","Muro-Fraguas, Ignacio; Sainz-García, Ana; López, María; Rojo-Bezares, Beatriz; Múgica-Vidal, Rodolfo; Sainz-García, Elisa; Toledano, Paula; Sáenz, Yolanda; González-Marcos, Ana; Alba-Elías, Fernando",Surf.

METHODS: A total of 20 COVID-19 confirmed patients and 30 negative nasopharyngeal swab specimens were analyzed by five kits. The detection ability of five RT-PCR kits was evaluated with 5 concentration gradients diluted by a single positive sample. The limit of detection was evaluated by N gene fragment solid standard. Two positive clinical specimens were used to evaluate the repeatability and imprecision. Finally, we used six human coronaviruses plasmid and four respiratory pathogens plasmid to check for cross-reactivity. RESULTS: The positive detection rate was 100% for Genekey, Daan, and BioGerm,and 90% for Liferiver and Yaneng in 20 clinical SARS-CoV-2 infection. The coincidence rate of five kits in 10 negative samples was 100%. The detection rate of target genes for Daan, BioGerm, Liferiver, and Yaneng was 100% from Level 1 to Level 3. In Level 4, only Daan detection rate was 100%. In Level 5, five kits presented poor positive rate. The limit of detection declared by each manufacturer was verified. The repeatability for target genes was less than 5% and so did the total imprecision. There is no cross-reactivity of five kits with six human coronaviruses and four respiratory pathogens for ORF1ab and N gene.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess factors associated with smoking status in a sample of students in the northern Kosovo province. Materials and methods: A total of 514 students enrolled in University in Kosovska Mitrovica, Kosovo, were recruited between April to June 2015 at Student Public Health Center during mandatory health checks. Participants filled in socio-demographic and behavioral questionnaire and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Based on responses about smoking, students were categorized in non-smokers, former smokers, light smokers (1-13 cigarettes/day) and heavy smokers (> 13 cigarettes/day). Results: Of 514 students, 116 (22.6%) classified themselves as smokers. Higher education level of fathers (Odds ratio [OR]=2.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30-6.44, p=0.009), not living with smokers (OR=0.42, 95%CI 0.15-0.97, p=0.017) and longer exposure to second hand smoke (OR=1.07, 95%CI 1.01-1.13, p=0.036) was associated with former smoking. Studying medical and natural sciences (OR=2.07, 95%CI 1.05-4.18, p=0.040), consuming alcohol (OR=2.98, 95%CI 1.19-10.03, p=0.020), living with smokers (OR=2.88, 95%CI 1.49-5.56, p=0.002), longer exposure to second hand smoke (OR=1.06, 95%CI 1.01-1.11, p=0.019) and having a more intense depressive symptoms (OR=1.08, 95%CI 1.03-1.13, p=0.002) was associated with light smoking.

While anxiety and post-traumatic stress have been evaluated in HCWs during previous pandemics, moral injury, a construct historically evaluated in military populations, has not. We hypothesized that the experience of moral injury and psychiatric distress among HCWs would increase over time during the pandemic and vary with resiliency factors. From a convenience sample, we performed an email-based, longitudinal survey of HCWs at a tertiary care hospital between March and July 2020. Surveys measured occupational and resilience factors and psychiatric distress and moral injury, assessed by the Impact of Events Scale-Revised and the Moral Injury Events Scale, respectively. Responses were assessed at baseline, 1-month, and 3-month time points. Moral injury remained stable over three months, while distress declined. A supportive workplace environment was related to lower moral injury whereas a stressful, less supportive environment was associated with increased moral injury. Distress was not affected by any baseline occupational or resiliency factors, though poor sleep at baseline predicted more distress. Overall, our data suggest that attention to improving workplace support and lowering workplace stress may protect HCWs from adverse emotional outcomes.","Hines, Stella E; Chin, Katherine H; Glick, Danielle R; Wickwire, Emerson M",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),140,17

The optimal management of respiratory failure and the role of lung ultrasound imaging in the evaluation of efficacy of treatment are unknown. METHODS: In March 2020 we treated 18 patients with mild and moderate ARDS secondary to SARS-CoV-2 with non-invasive continuous positive airway pressure therapy (NI-CPAP). All patients underwent lung ultrasound imaging to verify the entity of lung recruitment after NI-CPAP initiation. RESULTS: After one hour of treatment we observed a significant improvement in PaO2/FiO2 ratio in 10 patients. Notably, only 50 % of them reached an effective improvement in lung aeration detectable with lung ultrasound. In the other 50 % or patients the improvement in PaO2/FiO2 might be related to blood redistribution and reverse of hypoxic vasoconstriction. CONCLUSION: NI- CPAP is a valid therapeutic option in mild and moderate ARDS secondary SARS-CoV-2. Lung recruitment detected by means of lung ultrasound is a relevant but not the exclusive mechanism that underlies the therapeutic efficacy of NI-CPAP in this clinical setting.","Pagano, A; Porta, G; Bosso, G; Allegorico, E; Serra, C; Dello Vicario, F; Minerva, V; Russo, T; Altruda, C; Arbo, P; Mercurio, V; Numis, F G",Respir Physiol Neurobiol,140,32

In such a situation, finding the right hospital for the right ailment can be a considerable challenge. Inspired by this challenge, this work attempts to build a model that can automatically recommend hospitals based on user requirements. In the past there have been important works in physician recommendation. Our proposed work aims to be more inclusive and provide an automated hospital recommendation system to patients based on neural networks driven classification. We suggest a model that considers several unique parameters, including geographical location. To optimize its usefulness, we design a system that recommends hospitals for general consultation, specialty hospitals, and in view of the pandemic, hospitals recommended for treatment of COVID-19. In this work, we adopt Neural Networks and undertake a comparative analysis between several different available supervised algorithms to identify one best suited neural architecture that can work best in the applied fields. Based on our results from the analysis, we train the selected neural network with context relevant data. In the image of the recommendation system, we develop a website that uses the trained neural network on its backend and displays the recommendation results in a manner interpretable by the end user. We highlight the process of choosing the right neural model for the backend of the website. To facilitate the working of the website in real-time, we use real time databases hosted on Google Firebase and edge devices on hospital ends. Additionally, we suggest two hospital side data updation tools. These tools would ensure that hospitals can update the parameters which change quickly in the real world to their latest values so as to maintain the precision of the system. We test the website with test data and find that the website recommends hospitals with sufficient precision in the specified format. The model has been designed with the limited amount of data available in this field, but its performance and utility can be easily improved with better quality and more abundant data.","Paranjay, Om Adideva; Rajeshkumar, V",Indonesian Journal Of Science And Technology,140,20

Forty implants with different macrogeometries (Facility - Cylindrical with spiral-shaped threads; Alvim - Tapered with buttress-shaped threads) were inserted into artificial bone types I-II and III-IV. Surface morphology was evaluated by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and roughness parameters with Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy (LSCM) before and after insertion (AI). Implant macrogeometry was characterized by LSCM. The chemical composition of bone beds was determined by SEM associated with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy. The amount of Ti released was analyzed with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence. Alvim had greater IT and ISQ than Facility. Bone types I-II require higher IT of implants. Alvim also had greater internal threads angle, higher initial roughness, and significant reduction of roughness AI, compared to Facility. The functional surface height reduced AI, especially in flank and valley of threads. Height of surface roughness of Alvim and Facility implants was similar AI. Implants surface morphology changes and metallic particles on bone beds were observed after implant insertion, mainly into bone types III-IV. Implants inserted into bone types I-II showed less surface damage. Alvim implants released more Ti (37.52 ± 25.03 ppm) than Facility (11.66 ± 28.55 ppm) on bone types III-IV. The implant macrogeometry and bone types affect IT, ISQ, surface damage, and Ti amount released during insertion.

METHODS: The sample consisted of 1325 Finnish adults who filled out an online survey marketed on Facebook. Structural regression analysis was used to investigate whether: 1) conspiracy beliefs, a distrust in information sources, and endorsement of CAM predict people's response to the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) implemented by the government during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2) conspiracy beliefs, a distrust in information sources, and endorsement of CAM are related to people's willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine. RESULTS: Individuals with more conspiracy beliefs and a lower trust in information sources were less likely to have a positive response to the NPIs. Individuals with less trust in information sources and more endorsement of CAM were more unwilling to take a COVID-19 vaccine. Distrust in information sources was the strongest and most consistent predictor in all models. Our analyses also revealed that some of the people who respond negatively to the NPIs also have a lower likelihood to take the vaccine. This association was partly related to a lower trust in information sources. CONCLUSIONS: Distrusting the establishment to provide accurate information, believing in conspiracy theories, and endorsing treatments and substances that are not part of conventional medicine, are all associated with a more negative response to the official guidelines during COVID-19. How people respond to the guidelines, however, is more strongly and consistently related to the degree of trust they feel in the information sources, than to their tendency to hold conspiracy beliefs or endorse CAM. These findings highlight the need for governments and health authorities to create communication strategies that build public trust.","Soveri, Anna; Karlsson, Linda C; Antfolk, Jan; Lindfelt, Mikael; Lewandowsky, Stephan",BMC Public Health,140,16

Moreover, Qx has been used as an immunomodulator in cutaneous lupus erythematosus and various rheumatological diseases, by inhibiting phospholipase A2 modulating the Th1/Th2 response. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential antiviral effect of Qx against denominated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Vero E6 cells. The cytotoxicity of Qx in Vero E6 cells was determined by the MTT assay. Afterwards, Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at different multiplicities of infections (MOIs) of 0.1 and 0.01 in the presence of Qx (0-30 µM) to determinate the half maximal effective concentration (EC50). After 48 h, the effect of Qx against SARS-CoV-2 was assessed by viral cytotoxicity and viral copy numbers, the last were determined by digital real-time RT-PCR (ddRT-PCR). Additionally, electron and confocal microscopy of Vero E6 cells infected and treated with Qx was studied. Our data show that Qx reduces SARS-CoV-2 virus replication and virus cytotoxicity, apparently by inhibition of viral ensemble, as observed by ultrastructural images, suggesting that Qx could be a potential drug for further clinical studies against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection.","Salas Rojas, Mónica; Silva Garcia, Raúl; Bini, Estela; Pérez de la Cruz, Verónica; León Contreras, Juan Carlos; Hernández Pando, Rogelio; Bastida Gonzalez, Fernando; Davila-Gonzalez, Eduardo; Orozco Morales, Mario; Gamboa Domínguez, Armando; Sotelo, Julio; Pineda, Benjamín",Viruses,140,24

There is some in silico and in vitro evidence that suggests these agents may also be effective against SARS-CoV-2. This trial evaluated the effectiveness of sofosbuvir in combination with daclatasvir in treating patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Patients with a positive nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR or bilateral multi-lobar ground-glass opacity on their chest CT and signs of severe COVID-19 were included. Subjects were divided into two arms with one arm receiving ribavirin and the other receiving sofosbuvir/daclatasvir. All participants also received the recommended national standard treatment which, at that time, was lopinavir/ritonavir and single-dose hydroxychloroquine. The primary endpoint was time from starting the medication until discharge from hospital with secondary endpoints of duration of ICU stay and mortality. RESULTS: Sixty-two subjects met the inclusion criteria, with 35 enrolled in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir arm and 27 in the ribavirin arm. The median duration of stay was 5 days for the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir group and 9 days for the ribavirin group. The mortality in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir group was 2/35 (6%) and 9/27 (33%) for the ribavirin group. The relative risk of death for patients treated with sofosbuvir/daclatasvir was 0.17 (95% CI 0.04-0.73, P = 0.02) and the number needed to treat for benefit was 3.6 (95% CI 2.1-12.1, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Given these encouraging initial results, and the current lack of treatments proven to decrease mortality in COVID-19, further investigation in larger-scale trials seems warranted.","Eslami, Gholamali; Mousaviasl, Sajedeh; Radmanesh, Esmat; Jelvay, Saeed; Bitaraf, Saeid; Simmons, Bryony; Wentzel, Hannah; Hill, Andrew; Sadeghi, Anahita; Freeman, James; Salmanzadeh, Shokrollah; Esmaeilian, Hani; Mobarak, Morteza; Tabibi, Ramin; Jafari Kashi, Amir Hosein; Lotfi, Zahra; Talebzadeh, Seyed Mehdi; Wickramatillake, Aseni; Momtazan, Mahboobeh; Hajizadeh Farsani, Majid; Marjani, Sedigheh; Mobarak, Sara",J Antimicrob Chemother,140,12

The goal of this study was to clarify the clinical characteristics of recovery and death in patients with severe or critical COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective single-center study, clinical data were collected from 74 severe or critical COVID-19 patients in Wuhan Fourth Hospital between Jan. 25th and Feb. 26th, 2020. All patients were divided into a recovery group or a death group according to clinical outcomes, and the differences between the groups were compared. RESULTS: Of the 74 patients enrolled in the study, 48 (64.9%) were severe cases and 26 (35.1%) were critical cases. Sixty (81.1%) patients were recovered and 14 (18.9%) died. Compared with recovery patients, patients in the death group were older, and had higher incidences of hypertension, coronary disease and dyspnea at admission. Laboratory tests for lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, myoglobin, brain natriuretic peptide and D-dimer indicated higher levels in the death group. The PaO2:FiO2 ratio and minimum SpO2 were lower in the death group, and a higher proportion of these patients received noninvasive mechanical ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with comorbidities are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 or death. Patients with a low blood gas index and poor coagulation function at admission had a high mortality rate. For such patients, comprehensive treatment should be performed as soon as possible to improve the prognosis and reduce mortality.","Li, Junli; Xu, Ge; Yu, Heping; Peng, Xiang; Luo, Yongwen; Cao, Cheng039; an,",Am J Med Sci,140,16

People have had to resort to virtual events, with a subsequent proliferation of webinars, online meetings, and digital resources. In this situation we have had to find new ways of measuring the impact of these activities. Using the activities of the Italian Lichen Society (Società Lichenologica Italiana, SLI), Google Trends and colleagues' contributions, we evaluated the performances and impacts of virtual tools on lichenological literacy. We compared the relative success of virtual and in-person events and the effort required; we evaluated followers' appreciation of various categories of posts on SLI Facebook page; and designed a questionnaire to collate information on individual experiences of in-person and virtual events linked to lichens. As expected, online events generally required less effort to put together and deploy than in-person events and engaged more people, especially when recorded and made available online for a long time. Using online searches for the word ""lichens"" we found an association with national events, and there was a notable increase in membership of SLI over the last 10 years, demonstrating an increasing interest by people in lichens. Without excluding the positive effects of in-person experiences, we believe that online events offer a powerful tool to help increase interest in, and knowledge about lichens. This interest may help to mitigate the impact of anthropogenic activities on this sensitive component of the ecosystem and help human-lichen relationships.

In this work, concentrations of 67 elements in different tissues of females and males of the Mediterranean mussel are determined. Statistically significant differences are obtained in the element composition of analogous tissues of mussel males and females and in gonads of the same sex at different sexual maturation stages. The significantly higher concentrations of some elements found in gonads of females (Mn, Zn, As) and males (P) at most of the sexual maturation stages suggest essentiality of these elements in the reproduction. Elements exhibit several accumulation patterns in gonads during the ripening, with the most general one being the accumulation after spawning. Indications of a new phenomenon of circulation of most elements in gonads over the reproductive cycle are obtained, with the element concentrations decreasing at the first two stages and increasing at the posterior stages. Principal component analysis shows that the differences in the element accumulation are mainly due to the element uptake pathways and sexual differentiation. The most important identified factors determining the decrease in concentrations of tissue elements are their redistribution over mussel's body, biomass dilution, sequestration, and release with gametes. Five detected non-overlapping clusters of the non-normalized element concentrations in the pooled mussel tissues are associated with macroelements, two groups of trace elements, and two groups of ultratrace elements.","Kapranov, Sergey V; Karavantseva, Nadezhda V; Bobko, Nikolay I; Ryabushko, Vitaliy I; Kapranova, Larisa L",,140,10

METHODS: We developed the COVID-19 Acuity Score (CoVA) based on a single-center study of adult outpatients seen in respiratory illness clinics (RICs) or the emergency department (ED). Data was extracted from the Partners Enterprise Data Warehouse, and split into development (n = 9381, March 7-May 2) and prospective (n = 2205, May 3-14) cohorts. Outcomes were hospitalization, critical illness (ICU or ventilation), or death within 7 days. Calibration was assessed using the expected-to-observed event ratio (E/O).

In order to promote psychological resilience during this time, it is important to understand modifiable targets for clinical intervention. The current study examined demographic characteristics, pandemic-related adversity, and psychological flexibility in relation to general and peritraumatic distress in a sample of United States survey respondents during May of 2020. Participants were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), N = 485. Participants completed measures of pandemic-related adversity, psychological flexibility components (openness to experience, behavioral awareness, and valued action), peritraumatic distress, and general distress. Hierarchical regression analyses examined whether demographic characteristics, pandemic-related adversity, and components of psychological flexibility were associated with general and peritraumatic distress. Results indicated that higher pandemic-related adversity, lower openness to experience, and lower behavioral awareness were significantly associated with higher general distress. Greater pandemic-related adversity, lower openness to experience, lower behavioral awareness, and higher valued action were significantly associated with higher peritraumatic distress. Adding the components of psychological flexibility to the model increased the amount of variance accounted for in both measures of distress. The results indicated that psychological flexibility components may be particularly important targets for prevention and intervention efforts in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Transdiagnostic interventions, such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, that target psychological flexibility may be useful as the impact of the pandemic continues to unfold.","Kroska, Emily B; Roche, Anne I; Adamowicz, Jenna L; Stegall, Manny S",J Contextual Behav Sci,140,20

Alongside preparations to ensure equitable access to the vaccines among people globally, preparations must be made within countries for COVID-19 vaccines safety surveillance on an urgent basis. Safety surveillance must be capable of investigating adverse events of special interest (AESI) and adverse events following immunization to determine a change in the benefit-risk profile of the vaccine, and to be able to anticipate coincidental events that might be attributed to the vaccine. Active surveillance systems should calculate the incidence of background rates of AESI prior to vaccine roll out. These background rates vary tremendously across regions, populations and case ascertainment methods. Active surveillance systems must be established or strengthened now, (including in LMIC), to calculate the background rates. Utilizing standardized case definitions and global standards for AESI will help in harmonization. Vaccine safety communication plans should be developed.

Uganda aims to eliminate gHAT as a public health problem through detection and treatment of human cases and vector control. The latter is being achieved through the deployment of 'Tiny Targets', insecticide-impregnated panels of material which attract and kill tsetse. We analysed the spatial and temporal distribution of cases of gHAT in Uganda during the period 2010-2019 to assess whether Tiny Targets have had an impact on disease incidence. METHODS: To quantify the deployment of Tiny Targets, we mapped the rivers and their associated watersheds in the intervention area. We then categorised each of these on a scale of 0-3 according to whether Tiny Targets were absent (0), present only in neighbouring watersheds (1), present in the watersheds but not all neighbours (2), or present in the watershed and all neighbours (3). We overlaid all cases that were diagnosed between 2000 and 2020 and assessed whether the probability of finding cases in a watershed changed following the deployment of targets. We also estimated the number of cases averted through tsetse control. RESULTS: We found that following the deployment of Tiny Targets in a watershed, there were fewer cases of HAT, with a sampled error probability of 0.007. We estimate that during the intervention period 2012-2019 we should have expected 48 cases (95% confidence intervals = 40-57) compared to the 36 cases observed. The results are robust to a range of sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Tiny Targets have reduced the incidence of gHAT by 25% in north-western Uganda.","Bessell, Paul R; Esterhuizen, Johan; Lehane, Michael J; Longbottom, Joshua; Mugenyi, Albert; Selby, Richard; Tirados, Inaki; Torr, Steve J; Waiswa, Charles; Wamboga, Charles; Hope, Andrew",Parasit Vectors,140,26

Thrombocytopenia occurred in 18% of the patients. Male gender (P = 0.037) significantly reduce the incidence. Thrombocytopenia was associated with composite poor outcome (RR 1.90 (1.43-2.52), P < 0.001; I2: 92.3%). Subgroup analysis showed that thrombocytopenia was associated with mortality (RR 2.34 (1.23-4.45), P < 0.001; I2: 96.8%) and severity (RR 1.61 (1.33-1.96), P < 0.001; I2: 62.4%). Subgroup analysis for cut-off <100 × 109/l showed RR of 1.93 (1.37-2.72), P < 0.001; I2: 83.2%).

Awareness of the biological features of 2019-nCoV should be updated in time and needs to be comprehensively summarized to help optimize control measures and make therapeutic decisions. METHODS: Based on recently published literature, official documents and selected up-to-date preprint studies, we reviewed the virology and origin, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathology and treatment of 2019-nCoV infection, in comparison with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. RESULTS: The genome of 2019-nCoV partially resembled SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and indicated a bat origin. The COVID-19 generally had a high reproductive number, a long incubation period, a short serial interval and a low case fatality rate (much higher in patients with comorbidities) than SARS and MERS. Clinical presentation and pathology of COVID-19 greatly resembled SARS and MERS, with less upper respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, and more exudative lesions in post-mortems. Potential treatments included remdesivir, chloroquine, tocilizumab, convalescent plasma and vaccine immunization (when possible). CONCLUSION: The initial experience from the current pandemic and lessons from the previous two pandemics can help improve future preparedness plans and combat disease progression.","Xie, Mingxuan; Chen, Qiong",Int J Infect Dis,140,1

Recommendations have been made for its practice during the pandemic. This study was conducted to determine adherence to recommendations for endoscopy practice during the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America (LA). METHODS: A survey was conducted of endoscopists from LA consisting of 43 questions for the evaluation of four items: general and sociodemographic features, and preprocedure, intraprocedure and postprocedure aspects. RESULTS: A response was obtained from 338 endoscopists (response rate 34.5%) across 15 countries in LA. In preprocedure aspects (hand washing, use of face masks for patients, respiratory triage area, training for the placement/removal of personal protective equipment (PPE) and availability of specific area for the placement/removal of PPE), there was adherence in <75%. Regarding postprocedure aspects, 77% (261/338) had reused PPE, mainly the N95 respirator or higher, and this was with a standardised decontamination procedure only in 32% (108/338) of the time. Postprocedure room decontamination was carried out by 47% on >75% of occasions. In relationship to intraprocedure aspects (knowledge of risk and type of endoscopic procedures, use of PPE, airway management in patients and infrastructure), there was adherence in >75% for all the parameters and 78% of endoscopists only performed emergencies or time-sensitive procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to the recommendations for endoscopy practice during the COVID-19 pandemic is adequate in the intraprocedure aspect.

To date, there are no approved efficacious treatments targeting SARS-CoV-2, with current tactics (e.g. modulating the host response R2 0.9858;Fig. 1 A-B). Heat inactivation (100°C for 10 minutes) of rhRod (?rhRod) did not bind to spike protein (indeterminate;R2 0;Fig. 1 C-D). We then tested whether rhRod blocked ACE2 from binding to spike protein using 2 methods (Fig. 1 E-F). Immobilized spike protein sensors were first placed in rhRod (0-1000 nM) containing wells then placed into wells with 200 nM ACE2. The IC50 of rhRod was 139 ± 17 nM (R2 0.9959). A separate series of experiments were done using immobilized ACE2 sensors placed in wells containing 125 nM spike protein mixed with increasing concentrations of rhRod (0-500 nM). As the concentration of rhRod increased, binding to ACE2 sensors decreased, with an IC50 of 34 ± 8 nM (R2 0.9845). Based on our findings, we used in silico modeling (SwarmDock) to asses the predicted interactions between rhRod and spike. We found that rhRod was predicted to bind to spike protein in the same region as ACE2, consistent with our empirical data that rhRod blocks spike-ACE2 interactions. Finally, to test whether rhRod decreased SARS-CoV-2 replication, we infected Vero E6 cells with SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020;MOI 0.1) in the presence of rhRod (0-4,000 nM). Daily administration of rhRod decreased viral replication (PFU/mL) by 100-1000-fold (1000-4000 nM) starting at 48 hours, through 96 hours (segmental linear regression with least squares fit;Fig. 1G). ?rhRod (4000 nM) had no effect on viral replication. Our data show that rhRod binds to spike protein to block spike-ACE2 interactions and decreases SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in vitro. Data from these studies will inform preclinical models of COVID-19 to further develop a potential novel therapy for this devastating disease.","Lam, Fong Brown Cameron Ronca Shannon",The FASEB Journal,140,20

Little work has been done to understand vaccine willingness among older adolescents and young adults. This is important since this age group may be less likely to adhere to public health guidelines. OBJECTIVE: To understand willingness of getting a vaccine and reasons for vaccine hesitancy among a sample of older adolescents and young adults. DESIGN: Data were from the Well-Being and Experiences study (The WE Study), a longitudinal community-based sample of older adolescents and young adults collected from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada from 2017 to 2020 (n = 664). SETTING: The study setting was a community-based observational longitudinal study. PARTICIPANTS: Participants for the study were aged 14 to 17 years old at baseline in 2016-17 (n = 1000). Data were also collected on one parent/caregiver. Waves 2 (n = 747) and 3 (n = 664) were collected in 2019 and 2020, respectively. EXPOSURES: The main exposures were sociodemographic factors, health conditions, COVID-19 knowledge, and adversity history. MAIN OUTCOMES: The main outcomes were COVID-19 vaccine willingness, hesitancy, and reasons for hesitancy. RESULTS: Willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine was 65.4%. Willingness did not differ by age, sex, or mental health conditions, but did differ for other sociodemographic characteristics, physical health conditions, COVID-19 knowledge, practicing social/physical distancing, and adversity history. The most common reasons for not wanting a vaccine were related to safety, knowledge, and effectiveness. Sex differences were noted. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Increasing uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine among older adolescents and young adults may rely on targeting individuals from households with lower income, financial burden, and adversity history, and generating public health messaging specifically aimed at vaccine safety, how it works to protect against illness, and why it is important to protect oneself against a COVID-19 infection.","Afifi, Tracie O; Salmon, Samantha; Taillieu, Tamara; Stewart-Tufescu, Ashley; Fortier, Janique; Driedger, S Michelle",Vaccine,140,20

The recent Call to Action from the American College of Sports Medicine has promoted ""innovative strategies to promote PA during the COVID-19 pandemic"". We aimed to identify individual-level factors that protected against declines in PA levels amid the COVID-19 restrictions. METHODS: We utilized the Pennington Biomedical COVID-19 Health Behaviors Survey for our analyses and used mixed-effect linear and generalized linear models to estimate the effects of individual-level factors on changes in PA levels during the COVID-19 restrictions. RESULTS: Participants (n=4,376) provided information on PA behaviors before and during the COVID-19 shutdown. Overall, PA levels declined by a mean (SD) of 112 (1,460) MET minutes/week during the COVID-19 shutdown; however, changes in PA were heterogeneous, with 55% of the participants reporting increases in or maintenance of PA during that time. Several social and demographic factors were significantly related to declines in PA, including high pre-pandemic PA levels, living alone (difference=118 MET minutes/week), low household income (difference between the highest and lowest income group=363 MET minutes/week), COVID-19-related changes in income (difference=110 MET minutes/week), and loss of employment (difference=168 MET minutes/week). Substitution of pre-pandemic gym attendance with the purchase and use of home exercise equipment or exercise through virtual fitness platforms promoted increases in PA during the COVID-19 shutdown. CONCLUSIONS: While promoting PA through the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to consider demographic factors, which greatly influence health behaviors and implementation of, and access to, replacement behaviors. Promotion of such strategies could help maintain PA levels during potential future stay-at-home orders.","Fearnbach, S Nicole; Flanagan, Emily W; Höchsmann, Christoph; Beyl, Robbie A; Altazan, Abby D; Martin, Corby K; Redman, Leanne M",Med. sci. sports exerc,140,1

Yet, the conventional legal tools available to analyze those questions-including legal notions such as proportionality, equality, or the requisite levels of evidence-implicitly presume stable equilibria, and fail to capture the nonlinear properties of the pandemic. Because the pandemic diffuses in a complex system, using complexity theory can help align the law with its dynamics and produce a more effective legal response. We demonstrate how insights from complexity concerning temporal and spatial diffusion patterns, or the structure of the social network, can provide counter-intuitive answers to a series of pandemic-related legal questions pertaining to limitations of movement, privacy, business and religious freedoms, or prioritizing access to vaccines. This analysis could further inform legal policies aspiring to handle additional phenomena that diffuse in accordance with the principles of complexity.","Malcai, O.; Shur-Ofry, M.",Frontiers in Physics,140,29

COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) comorbidities have significantly increased morbidity and mortality. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor type 1 blockers (ARBs) improve CVD outcomes; however, there is concern that they may worsen the prognosis of CVD patients that become infected with SARS-CoV-2 because the virus uses the ACE2 receptor to bind to and subsequently infect host cells. Thus, some health care providers and media sources have questioned the continued use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs. In this brief review, we discuss the effect of ACE inhibitor-induced bradykinin on the cardiovascular system, on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) regulation in COVID-19 patients, and analyze recent clinical studies regarding patients treated with RAAS inhibitors. We propose that the application of RAAS inhibitors for COVID-19 patients with CVDs may be beneficial rather than harmful.","Wang, James Jiqi; Edin, Matthew L; Zeldin, Darryl C; Li, Chenze; Wang, Dao Wen; Chen, Chen",Pharmacol Ther,140,16

Even for experts robot programming is a cumbersome and error-prone task where faulty robot programs can be created, causing damage when being executed on a real robot. To simplify the process of robot programming, we combine Augmented Reality (AR) with principles of end-user development. By combining them, the real environment is extended with useful virtual artifacts that can enable experts as well as non-professionals to perform complex robot programming tasks. Therefore, Simple Programming Environment in Augmented Reality with Enhanced Debugging (SPEARED) was developed as a prototype for an AR-assisted robot programming environment. SPEARED makes use of AR to project a robot as well as a programming environment onto the target working space. To evaluate our approach, expert interviews with domain experts from the area of industrial automation, robotics, and AR were performed. The experts agreed that SPEARED has the potential to enrich and ease current robot programming processes.","Yigitbas, Enes; Jovanovikj, Ivan; Engels, Gregor",,140,17

After a month, it was declared a global threat to public health. The effects of the pandemic could be socio-economic, undermining the health system and risking livelihoods. Vulnerability to this infection has been associated with underlying comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic respiratory diseases, cancer, and compromised immune systems. Co-morbidity has been common to the elderly, the disabled, and the homeless. In addition, more severe coronavirus disease outcomes have been reported in older males than females. Nonetheless, multiple variables are related to the concept of cultural gender that should be taken into account as women in more affected sectors are economically disadvantageous and over-represented. Similarly, although children are not the face of this pandemic, calamity has a profound effect on their welfare, especially for those living in poor and inconvenient situations. Moreover, the economic influence could be profound and universal when viewed through a migration lens as it is exacerbating xenophobic and discriminatory treatment. Protection measures to mitigate the outbreak of a pandemic, such as social distancing, may reduce social support for certain categories relied on for their day-to-day activities. The mental health of people would definitely be affected by the additional psychosocial burden of the pandemic, particularly in vulnerable groups.

Time series models are significant in predicting the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and taking the necessary measures to respond to this crisis. In this study, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models were developed to predict the epidemiological trend of COVID-19 prevalence of Italy, Spain, and France, the most affected countries of Europe. The prevalence data of COVID-19 from 21 February 2020 to 15 April 2020 were collected from the World Health Organization website. Several ARIMA models were formulated with different ARIMA parameters. ARIMA (0,2,1), ARIMA (1,2,0), and ARIMA (0,2,1) models with the lowest MAPE values (4.7520, 5.8486, and 5.6335) were selected as the best models for Italy, Spain, and France, respectively. This study shows that ARIMA models are suitable for predicting the prevalence of COVID-19 in the future. The results of the analysis can shed light on understanding the trends of the outbreak and give an idea of the epidemiological stage of these regions. Besides, the prediction of COVID-19 prevalence trends of Italy, Spain, and France can help take precautions and policy formulation for this epidemic in other countries.","Ceylan, Zeynep",Sci Total Environ,140,30

Through an exploratory Canada-wide survey of EM in healthcare organizations, we aim to develop understanding of the prevalence and effectiveness of the disaster preparedness activities enacted in preparation for COVID-19. The online survey generated 161 responses;150 (93%) had EM responsibility. EM reported that reviewing infectious disease (pandemic) plans and protocols was the most widespread activity (82%), while simulation-based exercises was the least (26%). Organizational incident management response to COVID-19 was led by a sole ‘incident commander’ 61% of the time, while 39% of ‘incident commands’ were led by multiple individuals. Of all those assigned to lead IM, only 68% received training in that role. Overall, the prevalence of disaster preparedness activities in healthcare organizations was positively associated with leaders who received training in incident response and having a dedicated EM resource. Meanwhile, the overall effectiveness of activities was positively correlated with having a sole ‘incident commander’ and was found to improve as the overall prevalence of activities rose. The study provides strong evidence for regional, organizational, and EM resource variation in the delivery of disaster preparedness activities and training for leaders in Canadian healthcare. Hence, we recommend the creation of a national health emergency preparedness system which includes legislated standards and a national training centre to ensure Canadian healthcare is bolstered against future disasters including pandemics.","Richmond, John G.; Tochkin, Jeffrey Hertelendy Attila J.",International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,140,2

In particular, a simulation-based risk analysis approach enables scenario evaluation and comparison to guide decision making and action prioritization under uncertainty. We develop a simulation model to characterize the risks and uncertainties associated with infections resulting from aerosol exposure in in-person classes. We demonstrate this approach by applying it to model a semester of courses in a real college with approximately 11,000 students embedded within a larger university. To have practical impact, risk cannot focus on only infections as the end point of interest, we estimate the risks of infection, hospitalizations, and deaths of students and faculty in the college. We incorporate uncertainties in disease transmission, the impact of policies such as masking and facility interventions, and variables outside of the colleges control such as population-level disease and immunity prevalence. We show in our example application that universal use of masks that block 40% of aerosols and the installation of near-ceiling, fan-mounted UVC systems both have the potential to lead to substantial risk reductions and that these effects can be modeled at the individual room level. These results exemplify how such simulation-based risk analysis can inform decision making and prioritization under great uncertainty.","Swanson, Tessa; Guikema, Seth D.; Bagian, James; Schemanske, Christopher; Payne, Claire",,140,9

However, excessive consumption of fossil fuel energy has caused an energy shortage and led to severe environmental pollution. To achieve sustainable development, China is striving to transform its growth mode. Adopting renewable energy (RE) including solar photovoltaic (PV) power is an effective measure. How to promote the further development of solar PV power under the scenario of China’s aspirational target of carbon peak by 2030 and 20% RE ratio in the energy mix remains a theme that need to be addressed. This paper analyzes the potential opportunities and challenges confronting solar PV power in China. The analysis covers the dimensions of political, economic, social, and technological (PEST). The results revealed a significant prospect for the further deployment of solar PV power in the coming decades. The aggressive estimated installed capacity of solar PV power is expected to reach 80+ GW annually. To successfully achieve the goal of 80+ GW, barriers that hinder the further development of solar PV power have to be eliminated. Suggestions for policymakers include maintaining enforceability and continuity of policies, favorable financial supports, mandatory RE quotas for all parties, and supporting fundamental R&D. Suggestions for the solar PV industry include full utilization of integrated applications, set up an after-sales service network, collaborative innovation among the industry chain, and engaging in storage and hydrogen technology. The findings are greatly beneficial for policymakers and the solar PV industry.","Wang, Hengtian Yang Xiaolong Xu Xinxin Liu Fei",Energies,140,2

Entering host cells is a crucial stage in the early life cycle of the virus, and blocking this stage can effectively prevent virus infection. SARS enters the target cells mediated by the interaction between the viral S protein and the target cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as well as the cleavage effect of type-II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) on the S protein. Therefore, the ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 are important targets for SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors.

Methods The Dutch Radiological Society (NVvR) developed CO-RADS based on other efforts for standardization, such as Lung-RADS or BI-RADS. CO-RADS assesses the suspicion for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 on a scale from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high). The system is meant to be used in patients presenting with moderate to severe symptoms of COVID-19. The system was evaluated using 105 chest CTs of patients admitted to the hospital with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 in whom RT-PCR was performed (62 +/- 16 years, 61 men, 53 with positive RT-PCR). Eight observers assessed the scans using CO-RADS. Fleiss' kappa was calculated, and scores of individual observers were compared to the median of the remaining seven observers. The resulting area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was compared to results from RT-PCR and clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Results There was absolute agreement among observers in 573 (68.2%) of 840 observations. Fleiss' kappa was 0.47 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45-0.47), with the highest kappa for CO-RADS categories 1 (0.58, 95% CI 0.54-0.62) and 5 (0.68, 95% CI 0.65-0.72). The average AUC was 0.91 (95% CI 0.85-0.97) for predicting RT-PCR outcome and 0.95 (95% CI 0.91-0.99) for clinical diagnosis. The false negative rate for CO-RADS 1 was 9/161 (5.6%, 95% CI 1.0-10%), and the false positive rate for CO-RADS 5 was 1/286 (0.3%, 95% CI 0-1.0%). Conclusions CO-RADS is a categorical assessment scheme for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 on non-enhanced chest CT providing very good performance for predicting COVID-19 in patients with moderate to severe symptoms and has a substantial interobserver agreement, especially for categories 1 and 5.","Prokop, Mathias; van Everdingen, Wouter; van Rees Vellinga, Tjalco; Quarles van Ufford, Jet; Stöger, Lauran; Beenen, Ludo; Geurts, Bram; Gietema, Hester; Krdzalic, Jasenko; Schaefer-Prokop, Cornelia; van Ginneken, Bram; Brink, Monique",Radiology,140,13

Different organizations have recommended performing polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR) as part of the preoperative screening of surgical patients. We aimed to determine the performance of PCR testing to detect asymptomatic carriers. METHODS: Observational study carried out at a tertiary care center. We compared the results of preoperative real-time reverse-transcription-PCR test (RT-PCR) performed on a cohort of patients pending surgery with the results we would have expected assuming the epidemiological data released by government offices. RESULTS: We registered no positives in the 2,722 preoperative RT-PCR tests performed in our health care area between epidemiological Weeks 18 to 21, meaning a cumulative incidence trending to zero. Assuming public epidemiological data, the probabilistic projection of potential asymptomatic individuals ranged from 0.27*10e -4 (according to official data of new cases diagnosed by PCR) to 4.69*10e -4 if we assumed cases confirmed by IgG test in our province. Assuming a RT-PCR sensitivity of 95%, to obtain a positive result we should perform 38,461 and 2,028 tests respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In scenarios of very low prevalence and despite high sensitivity scores, indiscriminate preoperative RT-PCR screening is of a questionable effectiveness for detecting asymptomatic carriers. Our findings evidence the difficulty of establishing reliable predictive models for the episodic and rapidly evolving incidence of infections such as has characterized the SARS CoV2 pandemic.","de la Matta, M; Delgado-Sánchez, J M; Gutiérrez, G M; López Romero, J L; Del Mar Martínez Gómez, M; Domínguez Blanco, A",Rev. esp. anestesiol. reanim,140,33

Patients with cardiovascular risk factors or established cardiovascular disease are more likely to experience severe or critical COVID-19 illness and myocardial injury is a key extra-pulmonary manifestation. These patients frequently present with ST-elevation on an electrocardiogram (ECG) due to multiple etiologies including obstructive, non-obstructive, and/or angiographically normal coronary arteries. The incidence of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) mimics in COVID-19-positive hospitalized patients, and the association with morbidity and mortality is unknown. Understanding the natural history and appropriate management of COVID-19 patients presenting with ST elevation is essential to inform patient management decisions and protect healthcare workers. Methods: The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) and The Canadian Association of Interventional Cardiology (CAIC) in conjunction with the American College of Cardiology Interventional Council have collaborated to create a multi-center observational registry, NACMI. This registry will enroll confirmed COVID-19 patients and persons under investigation (PUI) with new ST-segment elevation or new onset left bundle branch block (LBBB) on the ECG with clinical suspicion of myocardial ischemia. We will compare demographics, clinical findings, outcomes and management of these patients with a historical control group of over 15,000 consecutive STEMI activation patients from the Midwest STEMI Consortium using propensity matching. The primary clinical outcome will be in- hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as composite of all-cause mortality, stroke, recurrent MI, and repeat unplanned revascularization in COVID-19 confirmed or PUI. Secondary outcomes will include the following: reporting of etiologies of ST Elevation; cardiovascular mortality due to myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest and /or shock; individual components of the primary outcome; composite primary outcome at 1 year; as well as ECG and angiographic characteristics. Conclusion: The multicenter NACMI registry will collect data regarding ST elevation on ECG in COVID-19 patients to determine the etiology and associated clinical outcomes.

Multiplying the scores by a coefficient of two resulted in a partial score of 20 points for each dimension and a total score of 100 points for the checklist taken as a whole. The quality of the communication media was considered to be good when exceeding the thresholds of 15/20 for the different dimensions and 75/100 for the entire grid. RESULTS: A total of 141 information media were included in this audit (Tunisia: 60; Algeria: 60; Morocco: 21). The overall median quality score for these media was only 56/100 (IIQ: [46-58]), without major variability between countries. The most appreciated dimension was ""maintaining the confidence of the population"", with an overall median score of 14/20 (12/20 for epidemiological bulletins and 16/20 for press releases). The most poorly rated dimension was ""strengthening community participation"", with a median score of only 4/20 (6/20 for epidemiological bulletins and 4/20 for press releases). CONCLUSION: The quality of the Maghreb crisis communication media during COVID-19 was insufficient in most of its dimensions and items, particularly from a psychosocial standpoint. Reinforcement of the capacities of communication officers to develop information material and supports during health crises is indispensable and should be considered as an urgent matter.","Ben Abdelaziz, A; El Haddad, N; Hannachi, H; Nouira, S; Melki, S; Chebil, D; Chelly, S; Quessar, A; Boussouf, N",Rev Epidemiol Sante Publique,140,16

The patient number rose to three by February 3, 2020. In the month of March 2020, the transmissions started to increase when the people started to return back to India from the Covid-19 affected countries. On March 12, a 76-year-old man having a travel history to Saudi Arabia was the first reported fatality in India due to Covid 19. Then for the prevention of the propagation of Covid, the Indian government declared a state of health emergency and strict counter measures were taken, including locking down of cities, prohibiting almost all avoidable activities and restricting population's mobility. From March 24, 2020 due to the complete lockdown in the country, human activities were heavily restricted in the whole geographical regions of India. This pandemic lockdown eventually serves as an opportunity to observe the background concentrations of pollutants in the atmosphere. The PM 2.5 distribution can affect human health and to overcome this problem, setting up of regulation for PM is necessary. In the present study Probability density functions (PDF) method have been utilised for the investigation of PM 2.5 pollutant data distribution of five countries namely, India, China, France, Brazil and United States of America (USA) for their respective lockdown period of 2020 and corresponding same period of 2019. A detailed study has been done for India, and for that purpose India has been divided into three regions (Central India, Coastal India and Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP)) on the basis of different meteorological conditions. PM 2.5 concentration for hourly basis has been analysed for the lockdown period 24th March to 15th June 2020 and compared with the PM 2.5 concentration of previous year 2019 for the same time period. To understand the effect of lockdown in PM 2.5 emission in India, which will give us an idea about the background concentration, PDFs (probability density functions) have also been generated for the whole year from 2015 to 2019. The ""goodness-of-fit"" of the probability density functions, to the data, was assessed, using various statistical indices (Chi-square test). Results show that the PM 2.5 reduction during the lockdown period of 2020 as compared to the same period of 2019 is sufficiently large. This study will give a certain degree of idea to the regulatory bodies on planning and implementation of strict air quality control plans.","Mishra, Gaurav; Ghosh, Kunal; Dwivedi, Anubhav Kumar; Kumar, Manish; Kumar, Sidyant; Chintalapati, Sudheer; Tripathi, S N",Sci Total Environ,140,24

Additionally, we aimed to explore staff experiences in LP services across Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust (BSMHFT) in order to generate Trust recommendations promoting optimal healthcare provision amidst the on-going pandemic.MethodA mixed method service evaluation was conducted using quantitative and qualitative analysis. Quantitative methods involved reviewing referrals made to the QEHB LP service from March to June 2020, compared with the equivalent time period in 2019. Data were retrospectively extracted from the electronic clinical databases RIO and PICS, and subsequently analysed using Microsoft Office. The number of, and reasons for referrals to LP were identified, whilst focus groups were conducted to explore the subjective experiences of staff working across BSMHFT LP services.ResultBetween 1st March and 30th June 2020, 984 referrals were made to the QEHB LP service, compared to 1020 referrals in 2019, representing a 3.5% reduction. From 2019 to 2020, referrals due to psychotic symptoms and deliberate self-harm rose by 12.8% and 14.1% respectively, whilst referrals for drug and alcohol-related causes reduced by 28.3%. A significant increase (150%) in referrals for medication or management advice was seen. Focus groups indicated that staff perceived an initial reduction in number of referrals, but an increase in the acuity of patient presentations.Staff reported anxiety around contracting and transmitting SARS-Cov-2, exacerbated by uncertainty around patients’ COVID-19 status. In QEHB, sixty-five of the 984 referrals (7%) had a positive SARS-Cov-2 PCR swab, with the remaining 919 referrals being either negative (68%) or unknown (25%). Ninety-six percent of consultations were conducted face-to-face in QEHB. There were conflicting views amongst staff regarding whether more consultations could have been conducted remotely. Furthermore, varying perceptions of support and communication from both the physical and mental health trust were reported.ConclusionQuantitative data indicates that COVID-19 impacted LP healthcare provision in BSMHFT. Whilst referral numbers remained similar between the equivalent period in 2019 and 2020, a change in the nature of referrals to LP at QEHB was seen. This was corroborated by qualitative data which highlighted a perceived change in acuity of referrals. These findings have been disseminated across the Trust and subsequent recommendations are being implemented during the on-going pandemic.","Jehanzeb, Saima Suleman Muhammad Tumelty Ella Okusanya Joanne Karunanithy Laxsan Thomas Lucretia Marshall Rebecca Bagchi Dhruba Hashmi Mahnaz",BJPsych Open,140,30

The PHocus Summer Experience was designed for high school students to explore population health and learn about the fundamentals of epidemiology, the breadth of topics addressed by public health, and public health careers. R-SPH hosted PHocus as 1-week sessions in Summer 2018 and 2019, available at both the School?s Piscataway, New Jersey, and Newark, New Jersey, locations. The Newark sessions targeted recruitment from high schools with underserved, minority, and/or economically disadvantaged students, and tuition for these students was supported through external funding. Across 2018 and 2019 PHocus Summer Experiences, 130 students participated, representing 63 high schools, in four 1-week sessions. The experience was rated very highly by participants;on a 4-point scale (1 = strongly disagree to 4 = strongly agree), the median score for the program being a worthwhile experience was 4.0.

Aim of the present study was to compare the effects of Near-Infrared (NIR) Light-Emitting Diode (LED) irradiation and different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) alone or combined to each other on the E. faecalis biofilm, on artificial and human dentin surfaces. E. faecalis ATCC 29212 preformed biofilms, on polystyrene wells and on dentin discs, were treated with 880 nm NIR irradiation and NaOCl at 4%, 2.5%, 1% and 0.5% alone and combined to each other (NIR irradiation plus NaOCl 1% or 0.5%) at 5 and 10 min. Treated biofilms were compared to the controls for (i) biofilm biomass evaluation, (ii) CFU count for the quantification of cultivable cells and (iii) cells viability. All the detected experimental conditions displayed a significant reduction of biofilm biomass (p < 0.001) and CFUs/mL (p < 0.01) in respect to the controls on both tested surfaces. The effects on the E. faecalis biomass, colony count and cell viability were not time-dependent except for NaOCl 2.5% and 1% in the biofilm biomass reductions on human dentin discs. NIR-LED irradiation alone showed a reduction of E. faecalis aggregates without interfering with cell viability whereas NaOCl alone expressed a killing effect in a concentration dependent way. The combination of NIR-LED irradiation with NaOCl 1% and 0.5% displayed a double effect of cluster disaggregation and cell killing. In particular, NIR-LED irradiation combined with NaOCl 0.5% displayed an anti-biofilm activity major than those expressed by NaOCl 0.5% alone (p = 0.001) with a reduction of biomass 93% vs 71% and 97% vs 25% after 10 min, on polystyrene wells and human dentin discs, respectively. The innovative use of NIR-LED irradiation combined at short times with low concentration of NaOCl (1% and 0.5%) is capable to reach a significant effect on E. faecalis biofilm, especially on human dentin discs.","D039,; Ercole, Simonetta; Di Fermo, Paola; Di Giulio, Mara; Di Lodovico, Silvia; Di Campli, Emanuela; Scarano, Antonio; Tripodi, Domenico; Cellini, Luigina; Petrini, Morena",J Photochem Photobiol B,140,25

METHODS: We conducted a monocenter retrospective study comparing the incidence of VAP and invasive aspergillosis between patients with COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (C-ARDS) and those with non-SARS-CoV-2 viral ARDS (NC-ARDS). RESULTS: We assessed 90 C-ARDS and 82 NC-ARDS patients, who were mechanically ventilated for more than 48 h. At ICU admission, there were significantly fewer bacterial coinfections documented in C-ARDS than in NC-ARDS: 14 (16%) vs 38 (48%), p < 0.01. Conversely, significantly more patients developed at least one VAP episode in C-ARDS as compared with NC-ARDS: 58 (64%) vs. 36 (44%), p = 0.007. The probability of VAP was significantly higher in C-ARDS after adjusting on death and ventilator weaning [sub-hazard ratio = 1.72 (1.14-2.52), p < 0.01]. The incidence of multi-drug-resistant bacteria (MDR)-related VAP was significantly higher in C-ARDS than in NC-ARDS: 21 (23%) vs. 9 (11%), p = 0.03. Carbapenem was more used in C-ARDS than in NC-ARDS: 48 (53%), vs 21 (26%), p < 0.01. According to AspICU algorithm, there were fewer cases of putative aspergillosis in C-ARDS than in NC-ARDS [2 (2%) vs. 12 (15%), p = 0.003], but there was no difference in Aspergillus colonization. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, we evidenced a higher incidence of VAP and MDR-VAP in C-ARDS than in NC-ARDS and a lower risk for invasive aspergillosis in the former group.","Razazi, Keyvan; Arrestier, Romain; Haudebourg, Anne Fleur; Benelli, Brice; Carteaux, Guillaume; Decousser, Jean-Winoc; Fourati, Slim; Woerther, Paul Louis; Schlemmer, Frederic; Charles-Nelson, Anais; Botterel, Francoise; de Prost, Nicolas; Mekontso Dessap, Armand",Crit Care,140,14

There has been sustainable growth of COVID-19 cases worldwide since mid-May 2020. To keep tabs on community transmission of COVID-19 infection screening of the samples from a large population is needed which includes asymptomatic/symptomatic individuals along with the migrant population. This requires extra resources, man power, and time for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In the current scenario, the pooled sample testing strategy advocated by the Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi is a new approach that is very promising in resource-limited settings. In this study, we have evaluated the pooled strategy in terms of accurate testing results, utilization of consumables, and identification of borderline positive cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between April and June 2020, we performed COVID-19 testing by RT-PCR from areas with varying prevalence of population referred to COVID laboratory, Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow. In the first step, the samples are collated into pools of 5 or 10. These pools are tested by RT-PCR. Negative pools were reported as negative whereas positive pools of 5 and 10 are then deconvoluted and each sample is tested individually. RESULTS: In the present study, we tested 4620 samples in 462 pools of 10 and 14 940 samples in 2990 pools of 5. Among 10 samples pool, 61 (13%) pools flagged positive in the first step. In the second step, among 61 pools (610 samples) deconvoluted strategy was followed in which 72 individual samples came positive. The pooled-sample testing strategy helps saves substantial resources and time during surge testing and enhanced pandemic surveillance. This approach requires around 76% to 93% fewer tests done in low to moderate prevalence settings and group sizes up to 5-10 in a population, compared to individual testing. CONCLUSIONS: Pooled-sample PCR analysis strategies can save substantial resources and time for COVID-19 mass testing in comparison with individual testing without compromising the resulting outcome of the test. In particular, the pooled-sample approach can facilitate mass screening in the early coming stages of COVID-19 outbreaks, especially in low- and middle-income settings, and control the spread by meticulous testing of all risk groups.","Garg, Jaya; Singh, Vikramjeet; Pandey, Pranshu; Verma, Ashish; Sen, Manodeep; Das, Anupam; Agarwal, Jyotsna",J Med Virol,140,1

Importantly, PPE donning may delay CPR thus worsening patient outcomes. We sought to determine the effect of our CPR-HFST on clinical practice. A retrospective review of CB events in a 1000-bedded hospital, pre- and intra-pandemic was conducted from 01/05/2019 to 30/10/2020. Onset of the pandemic was taken as 04/02/2020. CPR-HFST commenced in January 2020. The primary objective was to determine pre- and intra-pandemic response times. Intubation times, patient outcomes (quantified by CB survival rates and the CPC score), and incidence of HCW infection were our secondary objectives. The CCI score was used to stratify patients with similar comorbidities. Two-tailed Chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests were used for statistical comparisons, alpha = 0.05. 158 CB events were reviewed. Median response time was longer intra-pandemic compared to prepandemic;4.0 mins (IQR: 3-5) vs. 3.0 mins (IQR:1-4), p=0.0007. Cardiac rhythms were asystole (25.5%), PEA (53.8%), VT (5.7%), and VF (11.3%). 67.1% of patients required CPR, of which, 88.7% were intubated. There were no significant differences in median intubation times: 12.0 (prepandemic) vs. 11.0 mins (intra-pandemic), p=0.89. Survival to hospital discharge were similar;14.1% (pre-pandemic) vs. 21.4% (intra-pandemic), p=0.33. We did not find any significant differences in survival rates and CPC scores (Table 1). There were no HCW infections. Survival to hospital discharge rates of patients requiring in-hospital CPR may be lower intrapandemic;Miles et al reported 3.2% vs 12.8% respectively, p<0.01. These were significantly different compared to our intra-pandemic cohort (3.2% vs. 21.4%, p<0.01) but not in our pre-pandemic cohort (12.8% vs. 14.1%, p=0.82). Reasons for the differences are likely multifactorial. Nonetheless, in our experience and data, we believe CPR-HFST prevents deterioration in the standards of care and may help in optimising CPR outcomes. (Table Presented) .","Lim, W.

The diagnosis from space-based observations, i.e. the ratio of formaldehyde (HCHO) columns to tropospheric NO2 columns (HCHO / NO2), has previously been proved to be highly consistent with our current understanding of surface O3 chemistry. HCHO / NO2 ratio thresholds distinguishing O3 formation sensitivity depend on regions and O3 chemistry interactions with aerosol. To shed more light on the current O3 formation sensitivity over China, we have derived HCHO / NO2 ratio thresholds by directly connecting satellite-based HCHO / NO2 observations and ground-based O3 measurements over the major Chinese cities in this study. We find that a VOC-limited regime occurs for HCHO / NO2 &lt; 2.3, and a NOx-limited regime occurs for HCHO / NO2 &gt; 4.2. The HCHO / NO2 between 2.3 and 4.2 reflects the transition between the two regimes. Our method shows that the O3 formation sensitivity tends to be VOC-limited over urban areas and NOx-limited over rural and remote areas in China. We find that there is a shift in some cities from the VOC-limited regime to the transitional regime that is associated with a rapid drop in anthropogenic NOx emissions, owing to the widely applied rigorous emission control strategies between 2016 and 2019. This detected spatial expansion of the transitional regime is supported by rising surface O3 concentrations. The enhanced O3 concentrations in urban areas during the COVID-19 lockdown in China indicate that a protocol with simultaneous anthropogenic NOx emissions and VOC emissions controls is essential for O3 abatement plans.","Wang, Wannan van der A Ronald Ding Jieying Michiel van Weele Cheng Tianhai",Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,140,10

In particular, if a patient's condition is sufficiently severe to require invasive ventilation, it is more likely to lead to death than to recovery. OBJECTIVE: The goal of our study was to analyze the factors related to COVID-19 severity in patients and to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict the severity of COVID-19 at an early stage. METHODS: We developed an AI model that predicts severity based on data from 5601 COVID-19 patients from all national and regional hospitals across South Korea as of April 2020. The clinical severity of COVID-19 was divided into two categories: low and high severity. The condition of patients in the low-severity group corresponded to no limit of activity, oxygen support with nasal prong or facial mask, and noninvasive ventilation. The condition of patients in the high-severity group corresponded to invasive ventilation, multi-organ failure with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation required, and death. For the AI model input, we used 37 variables from the medical records, including basic patient information, a physical index, initial examination findings, clinical findings, comorbid diseases, and general blood test results at an early stage. Feature importance analysis was performed with AdaBoost, random forest, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost); the AI model for predicting COVID-19 severity among patients was developed with a 5-layer deep neural network (DNN) with the 20 most important features, which were selected based on ranked feature importance analysis of 37 features from the comprehensive data set. The selection procedure was performed using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, balanced accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: We found that age was the most important factor for predicting disease severity, followed by lymphocyte level, platelet count, and shortness of breath or dyspnea. Our proposed 5-layer DNN with the 20 most important features provided high sensitivity (90.2%), specificity (90.4%), accuracy (90.4%), balanced accuracy (90.3%), and AUC (0.96). CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed AI model with the selected features was able to predict the severity of COVID-19 accurately. We also made a web application so that anyone can access the model. We believe that sharing the AI model with the public will be helpful in validating and improving its performance.","Chung, Heewon; Ko, Hoon; Kang, Wu Seong; Kim, Kyung Won; Lee, Hooseok; Park, Chul; Song, Hyun-Ok; Choi, Tae-Young; Seo, Jae Ho; Lee, Jinseok",J Med Internet Res,140,16

Objective: To identify variation in COVID-19 mortality rates and how those rates have changed over the first months of the pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study assessed 38â¯517 adults who were admitted with COVID-19 to 955 US hospitals from January 1, 2020, to June 30, 2020, and a subset of 27â¯801 adults (72.2%) who were admitted to 398 of these hospitals that treated at least 10 patients with COVID-19 during 2 periods (January 1 to April 30, 2020, and May 1 to June 30, 2020). Exposures: Hospital characteristics, including size, the number of intensive care unit beds, academic and profit status, hospital setting, and regional characteristics, including COVID-19 case burden. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the hospital's risk-standardized event rate (RSER) of 30-day in-hospital mortality or referral to hospice adjusted for patient-level characteristics, including demographic data, comorbidities, community or nursing facility admission source, and time since January 1, 2020. We examined whether hospital characteristics were associated with RSERs or their change over time. Results: The mean (SD) age among participants (18â¯888 men [49.0%]) was 70.2 (15.5) years. The mean (SD) hospital-level RSER for the 955 hospitals was 11.8% (2.5%). The mean RSER in the worst-performing quintile of hospitals was 15.65% compared with 9.06% in the best-performing quintile (absolute difference, 6.59 percentage points; 95% CI, 6.38%-6.80%; P < .001). Mean RSERs in all but 1 of the 398 hospitals improved; 376 (94%) improved by at least 25%. The overall mean (SD) RSER declined from 16.6% (4.0%) to 9.3% (2.1%). The absolute difference in rates of mortality or referral to hospice between the worst- and best-performing quintiles of hospitals decreased from 10.54 percentage points (95% CI, 10.03%-11.05%; P < .001) to 5.59 percentage points (95% CI, 5.33%-5.86%; P < .001). Higher county-level COVID-19 case rates were associated with worse RSERs, and case rate declines were associated with improvement in RSERs. Conclusions and Relevance: Over the first months of the pandemic, COVID-19 mortality rates in this cohort of US hospitals declined. Hospitals did better when the prevalence of COVID-19 in their surrounding communities was lower.","Asch, David A; Sheils, Natalie E; Islam, Md Nazmul; Chen, Yong; Werner, Rachel M; Buresh, John; Doshi, Jalpa A",JAMA intern. med.

Our aim was to report its prevalence and outcome in a series of hypoxemic patients upon Emergency Department admission. METHODS: In this retrospective observational cohort study we enrolled a study population consisting of 213 COVID-19 patients with PaO2/FiO2 ratio <300 mmHg at hospital admission. Two groups (silent and dyspneic hypoxemia) were defined. Symptoms, blood gas analysis, chest X-ray (CXR) severity, need for intensive care and outcome were recorded. RESULTS: Silent hypoxemic patients (68-31.9%) compared to the dyspneic hypoxemic patients (145-68.1%) showed greater frequency of extra respiratory symptoms (myalgia, diarrhea and nausea) and lower plasmatic LDH. PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 225±68 mmHg and 192±78 mmHg in silent and dyspneic hypoxemia respectively (P=0.002). Eighteen percent of the patients with PaO2/FiO2 from 50 to 150 mmHg presented silent hypoxemia. Silent and dyspneic hypoxemic patients had similar PaCO2 (34.2±6.8 mmHg vs. 33.5±5.7 mmHg, P=0.47) but different respiratory rates (24.6±5.9 bpm vs. 28.6±11.3 bpm respectively, P=0.002). Even when CXR was severely abnormal, 25% of the population was silent hypoxemic. Twenty-six point five percent and 38.6% of silent and dyspneic patients were admitted to the ICU respectively (P=0.082). Mortality rate was 17.6% and 29.7% (log-rank P=0.083) in silent and dyspneic patients. CONCLUSIONS: Silent hypoxemia is remarkably present in COVID-19.

This study tested the hypothesis of alterations in levels of fecal eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (F-EDN) and eosinophil density and degranulation within the colonic mucosa of IBS patients compared with healthy controls (HC). Colonic biopsies were collected from 37 IBS patients and 20 HC and analyzed for eosinophil numbers and local degranulation of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) by histologic procedures. Fecal samples were collected for F-EDN and microbiota analysis. Differentiated 15HL-60 cells were used in vitro to investigate the direct effect of live bacteria on eosinophil activation measured by a colorimetric assay with o-phenylenediamine (OPD) substrate. We observed a higher number of eosinophils and increased extracellular ECP in the mucosa of IBS patients compared with HC. Moreover, F-EDN levels in IBS samples were elevated compared with HC and positively correlated to extracellular ECP. Metagenomic analysis showed significant correlations between bacterial composition and eosinophil measurements in both HC and IBS patients.

These 2-cell-like (2C-like) cells spontaneously transit back into the pluripotent state. We previously dissected the transcriptional dynamics of the transition from pluripotency to the totipotent 2C-like state and identified factors that modulate the process. However, how 2C-like cells transit back into the pluripotent state remains largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed the transcriptional dynamics from the 2C-like state to pluripotent ESCs and identified an intermediate state. The intermediate state characterized by two-wave step up-regulation of pluripotent genes is different from the one observed during the 2C-like entry transition. Nonsense-mediated Dux mRNA decay plays an important role in the 2C-like state exit. Thus, our study not only provides a transcriptional roadmap for 2C-like-to-pluripotent state transition but also reveals a key molecular event driving the transition.","Fu, Xudong; Djekidel, Mohamed Nadhir; Zhang, Yi",Sci.

METHODS: Using an online-based survey link sent via text message and email, we conducted a survey from April 21 to 25, 2020, targeting all ID physicians currently working in ID (n = 265). The questionnaire was based on the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales, and information was collected on factors protecting against psychological distress and difficulties in relation to COVID-19. RESULTS: Of 265 ID physicians, 115 (43.3%) responded, showing burnout (97, 90.4%), depression (20, 17.4%), anxiety (23, 20.0%), and stress (5, 4.3%). There were no differences in terms of distress between ID physicians who were directly involved in the care of patients with COVID-19 or not. Greater than 50% of physicians valued their work and felt recognized by others, whereas < 10% indicated that sufficient human and financial support and private time had been provided during the outbreak. The most challenging issues concerned a lack of attending physicians caring for COVID-19 patients or infection control practitioners, a shortage of personal protective equipment or airborne infection isolation rooms, pressure for research, and lack of guidelines for COVID-19 management. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 outbreak in the Republic of Korea, most respondents reported psychological distress. Preparing strategies to secure human resources are crucial to prepare effectively for future epidemics and pandemics.","Park, Se Yoon; Kim, Bongyoung; Jung, Dong Sik; Jung, Sook In; Oh, Won Sup; Kim, Shin-Woo; Peck, Kyong Ran; Chang, Hyun-Ha",BMC Public Health,140,16

The tropical cyclone Amphan largely affected agricultural land (78.2%) and forest, including mangroves (10.8%) in eastern India and Bangladesh. The built-up area over the trajectory of the cyclone and its proximity, including eastern parts of the Kolkata metropolitan area, was considerably affected by the cyclone due to the high population density and poor structural and community planning. Although the regions with close proximities to cyclones' trajectory (2033 km2 area under <2 km proximity) were affected severely, the presence of mangrove forest in Sundarban substantially reduced the magnitude of the tropical cyclone. A considerable decrease (~30%) in aerosol optical depth (AOD) in April-May 2020 as compared to that in 2019 is considered one of the major causes of the development of the warm pool and cyclogenesis in the Bay of Bengal.

This has also compromised the capacity for application of specialized Parkinson's disease (PD) therapies to an unknown extent. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide cross-sectional study using administrative database of all hospitalized patients with main diagnosis of PD receiving multimodal complex treatment (PD-MCT), initial setup of levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) or continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion (CSAI) in Germany. We compared case numbers and clinical characteristics of the pandemic (March 16th - May 15th, 2020) and post-lockdown (July 16th - September 15th, 2020) period with the pre-pandemic (January 16th - March 15th, 2020) and historical control period (March 16th - May 15th, 2019). RESULTS: We identified a strong decline for PD-MCT(-62.8%) and for the application of drug pump-based therapies (-69.4%) during the first peak phase of the pandemic as compared to the pre-pandemic period while specialized PD treatment procedures increased again in the post-lockdown phase. Advanced disease was a marker for PD-MCT patients during the pandemic period. CONCLUSION: Besides the marked decline in specialized PD treatments during the first peak phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, we found recuperative effects for these procedures in the post-lockdown period without reaching pre-pandemic levels. Strengthening treatment capacities for PD patients, even in the event of a persistent pandemic, is urgently needed in order to maintain the quality of care.","Richter, Daniel; Scherbaum, Raphael; Bartig, Dirk; Gold, Ralf; Krogias, Christos; Tönges, Lars",Parkinsonism Relat Disord,140,20

One widely-reported phenomenon is that of a profoundly hypoxemic patient with minimal to no dyspnea out of proportion to the extent of radiographic abnormalities and changes in lung compliance. This apparently unique presentation, sometimes called ""happy hypoxemia or hypoxia"" but better described as ""silent hypoxemia"", has led to the speculation of underlying pathophysiologic differences between COVID-19 lung injury and ARDS from other causes. We explore three proposed distinctive features of COVID-19 that likely bear on the genesis of silent hypoxemia, including differences in lung compliance, pulmonary vascular responses to hypoxia, and nervous system sensing and response to hypoxemia. In the context of known principles of respiratory physiology and neurobiology, we discuss whether these particular findings are due to direct viral effects or, equally plausible, are within the spectrum of typical ARDS pathophysiology and the wide range of hypoxic ventilatory and pulmonary vascular responses, and dyspnea perception in healthy people. Comparisons between lung injury patterns in COVID-19 and other causes of ARDS are clouded by the extent and severity of this pandemic, which may underlie the description of ""new"" phenotypes while limiting our ability to confirm these phenotypes by more invasive and longitudinal studies. However, given the uncertainty about anything unique in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 lung injury, there are no compelling pathophysiologic reasons at present to support a different therapeutic approach for these patients to the proven standards of care in ARDS.","Swenson, Kai E; Ruoss, Stephen J; Swenson, Erik R",Ann.

Otolaryngologists are especially susceptible with the elevated risk of aerosolization and corresponding high viral loads. This study utilizes a geospatial analysis to illustrate the comparative risks of older otolaryngologists across the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Demographic and state population data were extracted from the State Physician Workforce Reports published by the AAMC for the year 2018. A geospatial heat map of the United States was then constructed to illustrate the location of COVID-19 confirmed case counts and the distributions of ENTs over 60 years for each state. RESULTS: In 2018, out of a total of 9578 practicing U.S. ENT surgeons, 3081 were older than 60 years (32.2%). The states with the highest proportion of ENTs over 60 were Maine, Delaware, Hawaii, and Louisiana. The states with the highest ratios of confirmed COVID-19 cases to the number of total ENTs over 60 were New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Michigan. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our models, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Michigan represent states where older ENTs may be the most susceptible to developing severe complications from nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 due to a combination of high COVID-19 case volumes and a high proportion of ENTs over 60 years.","Ruthberg, Jeremy S; Quereshy, Humzah A; Jella, Tarun K; Kocharyan, Armine; D039,; Anza, Brian; Maronian, Nicole; Otteson, Todd D",Am J Otolaryngol,140,26

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Lebanon between 28th March and 11th April 2020. Data was collected through an online survey that included information on socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge, practice, physicians fear towards COVID-19 as well as their perceptions regarding actions/policies implemented by the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) and their health care facilities. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were carried out to identify the factors associated with good knowledge of COVID-19 and good practice toward its prevention. Adjusted odds ratio and their 95% confidence intervals were reported. RESULTS: Our survey revealed that the majority of Lebanese physicians had good knowledge about the disease (89.5%) while approximately half of the respondents adopted good preventive practices (49.7%). The odds of having good knowledge was 2.16 times higher among physicians aged 40 and above (adjusted OR = 2.16 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.08 to 4.34) compared to their counterparts aged less than 40 years old. Our results also showed that the odds of good practice was 2 times higher among frontline compared to the second line workers (adjusted OR = 2.01 with 95% CI of 1.21 to 3.34).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this review we identified 136 published studies in PubMed's curated literature database LitCovid on SARS-CoV­2 detection methods in tissues and evaluated them regarding sources of error, specificity, and sensitivity of the methods, taking into account our own experience. RESULTS: Currently, no sufficiently specific histomorphological alterations or diagnostic features for COVID-19 are known. Therefore, three approaches for SARS-CoV­2 detection are used: RNA, proteins/antigens, or morphological detection by electron microscopy. In the preanalytical phase, the dominant source of error is tissue quality, especially the different intervals between sample collection and processing or fixation (and its duration) and specifically the interval between death and sample collection in autopsies. However, this information is found in less than half of the studies (e.g., in only 42% of autopsy studies). Our own experience and first studies prove the significantly higher sensitivity and specificity of RNA-based detection methods compared to antigen or protein detection by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence. Detection by electron microscopy is time consuming and difficult to interpret. CONCLUSIONS: Different methods are available for the detection of SARS-CoV­2 in tissue. Currently, RNA detection by RT-PCR is the method of choice. However, extensive validation studies and method harmonization are not available and are absolutely necessary.","von Stillfried, Saskia; Boor, Peter",Pathologe,140,4

The public health emergency and COVID-19 pandemic regulations in New York City required a novel workflow to sustain existing operations. While regulatory enforcement discretions offered faculty workspace flexibility, a substantial portion of laboratory and digital pathology workflows require on-site presence of staff. Maintaining social distancing and offering staggered work schedules. Due to a decrease in patients seeking health care at the onset of the pandemic, a temporary decrease in patient specimens was observed. Hospital and travel regulations impacted onsite vendor technical support. Digital glass slide scanning activities onsite proceeded without interruption throughout the pandemic, with challenges including staff who required quarantine due to virus exposure, unrelated illness, family support, or lack of public transportation. During the public health emergency, we validated digital pathology systems for a remote pathology operation. Since March 2020, the departmental digital pathology staff were able to maintain scanning volumes of over 100 000 slides per month. The digital scanning team reprioritized archival slide scanning and participated in a remote sign-out validation and successful submission of New York State approval for a laboratory developed test. Digital pathology offers a health care delivery model where pathologists can perform their sign out duties at remote location and prevent disruptions to critical pathology services for patients seeking care at our institution during emergencies. Development of standard operating procedures to support digital workflows will maintain turnaround times and enable clinical operations during emergency or otherwise unanticipated events. © The Author(s) 2021.","Ardon, O.; Reuter, V.

In this study, we screened a library of saRNA constructs with cis-encoded innate inhibiting proteins (IIPs) and determined the effect on protein expression and immunogenicity. We observed that the PIV-5 V and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) ORF4a proteins enhance protein expression 100- to 500-fold in vitro in IFN-competent HeLa and MRC5 cells. We found that the MERS-CoV ORF4a protein partially abates dose nonlinearity in vivo, and that ruxolitinib, a potent Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) inhibitor, but not the IIPs, enhances protein expression of saRNA in vivo. Both the PIV-5 V and MERS-CoV ORF4a proteins were found to enhance the percentage of resident cells in human skin explants expressing saRNA and completely rescued dose nonlinearity of saRNA. Finally, we observed that the MERS-CoV ORF4a increased the rabies virus (RABV)-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer and neutralization half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) by â¼10-fold in rabbits, but not in mice or rats. These experiments provide a proof of concept that IIPs can be directly encoded into saRNA vectors and effectively abate the nonlinear dose dependency and enhance immunogenicity.","Blakney, Anna K; McKay, Paul F; Bouton, Clément R; Hu, Kai; Samnuan, Karnyart; Shattock, Robin J",Mol Ther,140,24

To test our hypotheses, we used a quasi-experimental between-subjects design, in which participants were randomly assigned to a disgust induction condition (N = 102) or a non-induction neutral group (N = 92). The induction scenario featured the return of the diaspora to their home country due to COVID-19 concerns. In one scenario, the diaspora lied about the country they arrived from, and in the other, there was no moral transgression. We hypothesized that the effect of disgust sensitivity on dehumanization and aggressive tendencies passed through contamination fear and the moderated mediation model indicated that this indirect effect was stronger for participants in the disgust-induction than in the non-induction group. This effect was found for biological dehumanization and passive aggression outcomes, both related to outgroup bias. Consistent with the role of disgust as a disease-avoidance mechanism, our results suggest that disgust could facilitate stronger outgroup bias in the context of a high health threat, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Luca, Andreea I; Podina, Ioana R; Boian, RareÈ",Curr Psychol,140,16

Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was conducted. The data was collected from the case sheets of the case files of patients presenting to the Department of General Medicine Triage who were admitted from the month of July 2020 to December 2020 and analysis was done in January 2021. The method of sampling employed was a non-probability sequential sampling method. Results: Age and sex distributions were comparable in both the groups. The percentage of the patients who expired was 10% and 9% (n=10 and 9, respectively) in Non-RDV and RDV groups respectively, this was statistically insignificant (0.809). However, the duration of hospital stay in those who received RDV was 10 (9-12) days while those receiving standard of care without RDV was 12 (10-15) days (0.0018) which was statistically significant. Also, after a comparison between the two groups it was evident that there was a significant difference in inflammatory markers D-dimer and Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) with p=0.001 and 0.029, respectively. Conclusion: Study concludes that there was no significant difference in outcome of patients who received RDV. However, the duration of hospital stay was found to be decreased in patients receiving RDV and also there was a significant improvement in inflammatory markers like LDH and D-dimer.","Kumar, J. M.

Early in the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, care providers were challenged by information gaps, supply shortages, and lack of resource coordination in caring for patients, which affected their ability to care for patients. As an emergency unfolds in a community, preemptive planning is needed to prevent barriers to quality patient care, support disease surveillance and contact tracing, and optimize the use of limited resources ranging from personal protective equipment to disease testing and hospital care. The experience of primary health-care providers during this pandemic provides useful information for understanding the gaps in emergency planning and management during a public health emergency.","Schmidt, Mary E.; von Fricken, Michael E.; Wofford, Rachel N.; Libby, Russel C.; Maddox, Peggy J.",World Med.

First, it sets out to lay down a set of moral principles governing the allocation of scarce resources (mechanical ventilation, ECMO, etc.). This way it paves the way for more concrete ethical recommendations. Second, it analyses and describes in elaborate detail the criteria for admission to the ICU and two triage phases. The first reflects egalitarian concerns, and the second considers age as a proxy for the badness of death and other age-related considerations.

The cytokine storm and viral evasion of cellular immune responses may play an equally important role in the pathogenesis, clinical manifestation, and outcomes of COVID-19. Systemic proinflammatory cytokines and biomarkers are elevated as the disease progresses towards its advanced stages, and correlate with worse chances of survival. Immune modulators have the potential to inhibit cytokines and treat the cytokine storm. A literature search using PubMed, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov was conducted through 8 July 2020 using the search terms 'coronavirus', 'immunology', 'cytokine storm', 'immunomodulators', 'pharmacology', 'severe acute respiratory syndrome 2', 'SARS-CoV-2', and 'COVID-19'. Specific immune modulators include anti-cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 receptor antagonists (e.g. anakinra, tocilizumab, sarilumab, siltuximab), Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (e.g. baricitinib, ruxolitinib), anti-tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (e.g. adalimumab, infliximab), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors (e.g. gimsilumab, lenzilumab, namilumab), and convalescent plasma, with promising to negative trials and other data.

Relatively rare movement disorders associated with COVID-19 are increasingly reported in case reports or case series. Here, we present a case and systematic review of myoclonus and cerebellar ataxia associated with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline using the PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE databases, from November 1, 2019 to December 6, 2020. RESULTS: 51 cases of myoclonus or ataxia associated with COVID-19, including our case, were identified from 32 publications. The mean age was 59.6 years, ranging from 26 to 88 years, and 21.6% were female. Myoclonus was multifocal or generalized and had an acute onset, usually within 1 month of COVID-19 symptoms. Myoclonus occurred in isolation (46.7%), or with ataxia (40.0%) or cognitive changes (30.0%). Most cases improved within 2 months, and treatment included anti-epileptic medications or immunotherapy. Ataxia had an acute onset, usually within 1 month of COVID-19 symptoms, but could be an initial symptom. Concurrent neurological symptoms included cognitive changes (45.5%), myoclonus (36.4%), or a Miller Fisher syndrome variant (21.2%). Most cases improved within 2 months, either spontaneously or with immunotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review highlights myoclonus and ataxia as rare and treatable post-infectious or para-infectious, immune-mediated phenomena associated with COVID-19.

We performed a literature review and undertook semi-structured reflections on the current state of undergraduate surgical education across five countries: Egypt, Morocco, Somaliland, Kenya, and the UK. The main barriers to surgical education at medical school identified were (1) the lack of standardised surgical curricula with mandatory learning objectives and (2) the inadequacy of human resources for surgical education. COVID-19 has exacerbated these challenges by depleting the pool of surgical educators and reducing access to learning opportunities in clinical environments. To address the global need for a larger surgical workforce, specific attention must be paid to improving undergraduate surgical education. Solutions proposed include the development of a standard surgical curriculum with learning outcomes appropriate for local needs, the incentivisation of surgical educators, the incorporation of targeted online and simulation teaching, and the use of technology.","Ravi, Krithi; Anyamele, Ugonna Angel; Korch, Moniba; Badwi, Nermin; Daoud, Hassan Ali; Shah, Sayed Shah Nur Hussein",Indian J Surg,140,1

Furthermore, abnormally processed RNAs can cause a variety of diseases, including obesity, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. Especially in cancer development, aberrant RNAs caused by deregulated RNA modifiers or regulators are related to progression. Accumulating evidence has reported that aberrant RNAs promote carcinogenesis in many cancers, including liver cancer, leukemia, melanoma, lung cancer, breast cancer, and other cancers, in which abnormal RNA processing occurs in normal cells. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the precise roles and mechanisms of disease-related RNA processing in various cancers for the development of therapeutic interventions. In this review, the underlying mechanisms of variations in the RNA life cycle and the biological impacts of RNA variations on carcinogenesis will be discussed, and therapeutic strategies for the treatment of tumor malignancies will be provided.

Adults living in the U.S. (N = 157, Mage = 31.7, 84.1% female) participated in a 28-day smartphone-based EMA study during the early months of the pandemic (April–June 2020). Evening EMA surveys assessed daily PA minutes, momentary positive activated and deactivated affect, and momentary negative activated and deactivated affect. An online questionnaire assessed demographics. Multi-level linear regression models assessed day-level associations between PA and evening affect, controlling for age, sex, income, body mass index, employment status, and morning affect. There were N = 2409 person-days in the analysis. Baseline COVID-19 stress was not associated with daily PA minutes (p = .09) or positive-activated affect (p = .14), but was associated with lower positive-deactivated affect (p &lt; .001) and greater negative-activated and negative-deactivated affect (ps &lt; .001) in the evenings. On days when individuals reported more PA than usual, they reported greater positive-activated and positive-deactivated affect, and lower negative-activated and negative-deactivated affect in the evening (ps &lt; .001). The interaction of day-level PA and COVID-19 stress predicting evening positive-activated, positive-deactivated, negative-activated, and negative-deactivated affect was not significant (ps &gt; .05). During the early months of the pandemic, adults experienced improved evening affect on days when they engaged in more PA. However, data did not show that PA counteracts detrimental effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on evening affect. Public health efforts should strategically promote and address barriers to PA during the pandemic.","Do, Bridgette Wang Shirlene D.; Courtney, Jimikaye B.; Dunton, Genevieve F.",Psychology of Sport and Exercise,140,21

Respiratory infections occur primarily in the majority of patients treated with COVID-19. In light of the growing number of COVID-19 cases, the need for diagnostic tools to identify COVID-19 infection at early stages is of vital importance. For decades, chest X-ray (CXR) technologies have proven their ability to accurately detect respiratory diseases. More recently, with the availability of COVID-19 CXR scans, deep learning algorithms have played a critical role in the healthcare arena by allowing radiologists to recognize COVID-19 patients from their CXR images. However, the majority of screening methods for COVID-19 reported in recent studies are based on 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Although 3D CNNs are capable of capturing contextual information compared to their 2D counterparts, their use is limited due to their increased computational cost (i.e. requires much extra memory and much more computing power). In this study, a transfer learning-based hybrid 2D/3D CNN architecture for COVID-19 screening using CXRs has been developed. The proposed architecture consists of the incorporation of a pre-trained deep model (VGG16) and a shallow 3D CNN, combined with a depth-wise separable convolution layer and a spatial pyramid pooling module (SPP). Specifically, the depth-wise separable convolution helps to preserve the useful features while reducing the computational burden of the model. The SPP module is designed to extract multi-level representations from intermediate ones. Experimental results show that the proposed framework can achieve reasonable performances when evaluated on a collected dataset (3 classes to be predicted: COVID-19, Pneumonia, and Normal). Notably, it achieved a sensitivity of 98.33%, a specificity of 98.68% and an overall accuracy of 96.91.","Bayoudh, Khaled; Hamdaoui, Fayçal; Mtibaa, Abdellatif",,140,20

In this work, a lead/lag compensator is proposed to control an unstable Covid-19 nonlinear system after using some required assumptions. The control theory is involved with the unstable pandemic and other existing strategies until the invention of the vaccine is approved. In addition, the Most Valuable Player Algorithm (MVPA) is used to optimize the parameters of the proposed controller and to determine whether it is a lead or lag compensator. Finally, the simulation results are based on the daily reports of two pandemic cities: Hubei (China), and Lazio (Italy) since the outbreak began.

Despite a plethora of information on the internet, there is little supporting evidence and no human studies. The risk of multiplex ventilation is that ventilation and PEEP effects are largely uncontrollable and depend on the difference between patients' resistance and compliance. It is not clear whether volume control ventilation or pressure control ventilation is safer or more effective. We designed a simulation-based study to allow complete control over the relevant variables to determine the effects of various degrees of resistance-compliance imbalance on tidal volume (VT), end-expiratory lung volume (EELV), and imputed pH. METHODS: Two separate breathing simulators were ventilated with a ventilator using pressure control and volume control ventilation modes. Evidence-based lung models simulated a range of differences in resistance and compliance (6 pairs of simulated patients). Differences in VT, EELV, and imputed pH were recorded. RESULTS: Depending on differences in resistance and compliance, differences in VT ranged from 1% (with equal resistance and compliance) to 79%. Differences in EELV ranged from 2% to 109%, whereas differences in pH ranged from 0% to 5%. Failure due to excessive VT (ie, > 8 mL/kg) did not occur, but failure due to excessive EELV difference (ie, > 10%) was evident in 50% of patient pairs. There was no difference in failure rate between volume control and pressure control ventilation modes. CONCLUSIONS: These experiments confirmed the potential for markedly different ventilation and oxygenation for patients with uneven respiratory system impedances during multiplex ventilation. Three critical problems must be solved to minimize risk: (1) partitioning of inspiratory flow from the ventilator individually between the 2 patients, (2) measurement of VT delivered to each patient, and (3) provision for individual PEEP. We provide suggestions for solving these problems.","Chatburn, Robert L; Branson, Richard D; Hatipoglu, Umur",Respir Care,140,26

We provide insight on the impact that health care restriction has made on neurosurgical activity in Latin Iberoamerica. METHODS: We performed an internet-based survey among presidents and members of the societies of the Latin American Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (FLANC). We blindly analyzed information regarding local conditions and their impact on neurosurgical praxis using SPSS software. RESULTS: Information came from 21 countries. Sixteen society presidents reported having suspended regular activities and deferring local scheduled congresses, 14 reported mandatory isolation by government, and 4 instituted a telemedicine project. Four-hundred eighty-six colleagues, mean age 49 years, reported a mean 79% reduction in their neurosurgical praxis. Seventy-six percent of neurosurgeons have savings to self-support for 3-6 months if restrictions are long lasting. CONCLUSIONS: Stopping activities among societies of the FLANC, together with a drop of 79% of neurosurgical praxis, adds to deficits in provider's protection equipment and increasing demand for attention in the health care systems, representing a huge financial risk to their sustainability. Neurosurgeons should be involved in local policies to protect health and economy. Telemedicine represents an excellent solution, avoiding another pandemic of severe diseases across all-specialties as nonessential care can turn essential if left untreated.

The pressure to produce drugs and vaccines against the ongoing pandemic has resulted in the use of some drugs such as azithromycin, chloroquine (sulfate and phosphate), hydroxychloroquine, dexamethasone, favipiravir, remdesivir, ribavirin, ivermectin, and lopinavir/ritonavir. However, reports from some of the clinical trials with these drugs have proved detrimental on some COVID-19 infected patients with side effects more of which cardiomyopathy, cardiotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, macular retinopathy, and hepatotoxicity have been recently reported. Realizing the need for potent and harmless therapeutic compounds to combat COVID-19, we attempted in this study to find promising therapeutic compounds against the imminent threat of this virus. In this current study, 16 derivatives of gallic acid were docked against five selected non-structural proteins of SARS-COV-2 known to be a good target for finding small molecule inhibitors against the virus, namely, nsp3, nsp5, nsp12, nsp13, and nsp14. All the protein crystal structures and 3D structures of the small molecules (16 gallic acid derivatives and 3 control drugs) were retrieved from the Protein database (PDB) and PubChem server respectively. The compounds with lower binding energy than the control drugs were selected and subjected to pharmacokinetics screening using AdmetSAR server. RESULTS: 4-O-(6-galloylglucoside) gave binding energy values of - 8.4, - 6.8, - 8.9, - 9.1, and - 7.5 kcal/mol against Mpro, nsp3, nsp12, nsp13, and nsp15 respectively. Based on the ADMET profile, 4-O-(6-galloylglucoside) was found to be metabolized by the liver and has a very high plasma protein binding. CONCLUSION: The result of this study revealed that 4-O-(6-galloylglucoside) could be a promising inhibitor against these SAR-Cov-2 proteins. However, there is still a need for further molecular dynamic simulation, in vivo and in vitro studies to support these findings.","Umar, Haruna Isiyaku; Siraj, Bushra; Ajayi, Adeola; Jimoh, Tajudeen O; Chukwuemeka, Prosper Obed",J Genet Eng Biotechnol,140,32

However, its safety profile, including adverse events of special interest (AESIs) and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) by age, sex, and body mass index (BMI), is not well known. The present analysis evaluated the safety profile and AESIs for fruquintinib in the FRESCO trial. METHODS: In FRESCO, eligible Chinese patients were randomized (2:1) to receive fruquintinib (5 mg once daily for 3 weeks, followed by 1 week off in 28-day cycles) or placebo plus best supportive care. Treatment-related AESIs and time to first occurrence of AESIs were summarized. Treatment-related TEAEs by age, sex, and BMI were also summarized. RESULTS: A total of 266 patients (95.7%) in the fruquintinib group and 97 (70.8%) in the placebo group had at least one treatment-related TEAE; the mean relative dose intensity was 92% and 98%, respectively. In the fruquintinib group, the most common (in > 40% of patients) treatment-related AESIs were hypertension (55.4%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome [known as hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR)] (49.3%), and proteinuria (42.1%). The most common treatment-related grade &#8805; 3 AESIs (&#8805; 3% of patients) were hypertension (21.2%), HFSR (10.8%), and proteinuria (3.2%); the median time to onset of these events was 10, 21, and 20 days, respectively. Subgroup analysis by age, sex, and BMI revealed that the frequencies of treatment-related TEAEs were similar across all subgroups, and were consistent with the overall safety profile of fruquintinib. CONCLUSIONS: The most common treatment-related grade &#8805; 3 AEs were hypertension, HFSR, and proteinuria. The treatment-related TEAE profile of fruquintinib in Chinese patents with mCRC was comparable among different subgroups and consistent with that reported in the overall population.

However, the precise mechanism underlying the regulation of VGLL1 activation remains unknown. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the transforming growth factor-ß (TGF-ß)-mediated activation of VGLL1 and the VGLL1-TEAD4 interaction in gastric cancer cells. We showed that TGF-ß enhanced VGLL1 phosphorylation and that this phosphorylated VGLL1 functioned as a transcription cofactor of TEAD4 in NUGC3 cells. TGF-ß also increased the phosphorylation of ERK and ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) in NUGC3 cells, thereby triggering the translocation of phosphorylated RSK2 to the nucleus. Site-directed mutagenesis and immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that RSK2 phosphorylated VGLL1 at S84 in the presence of TGF-ß. Mutation of VGLL1 at S84 suppressed VGLL1-TEAD4 binding and the subsequent transcriptional activation of matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP9). Moreover, VGLL1 peptide containing S84 suppressed the TGF-ß-induced MMP9 expression and reduced the invasion and proliferation of gastric cancer cells, whereas VGLL1 peptide containing S84A did not. Furthermore, suppression of expression or activation of VGLL1 enhances the therapeutic effects of lapatinib. Collectively, these results indicate that VGLL1 phosphorylation via TGF-ß/ERK/RSK2 signaling plays a crucial role in MMP9-mediated malignancy of gastric cancer. In addition, our study highlights the therapeutic potential of the peptide containing VGLL1 S84 for the treatment of gastric cancer.","Im, Joo-Young; Kim, Da-Mi; Park, Hyunkyung; Kang, Mi-Jung; Kim, Da-Yoon; Chang, Kwan Young; Kim, Bo-Kyung; Won, Misun",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Res,140,21

The admission of large numbers of patients with suspected COVID-19 disease risks overwhelming the capacity to protect other patients from exposure. The delay between clinical suspicion and confirmatory testing adds to the complexity of the problem. METHODS: We implemented a triage tool aimed at minimizing hospital-acquired COVID-19 particularly in patients at risk of severe disease. Patients were allocated to triage categories defined by likelihood of COVID-19 and risk of a poor outcome. Category A (low-likelihood; high-risk), B (high-likelihood; high-risk), C (high-likelihood; low-risk) and D (low-likelihood; low-risk). This determined the order of priority for isolation in single-occupancy rooms with Category A the highest. Patients in other groups were cohorted when isolation capacity was limited with additional interventions to reduce transmission. RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were evaluated with 79 (85%) receiving a COVID-19 diagnosis during their admission. Of those without a COVID-19 diagnosis: 10 were initially triaged to Category A; 0 to B; 1 to C and 4 to D. All high-risk patients requiring isolation were, therefore, admitted to single-occupancy rooms and protected from exposure. Twenty-eight (30%) suspected COVID-19 patients were evaluated to be low risk (groups C and D) and eligible for cohorting.

To do this, we use a model based on non-extensive statistical mechanics, where we derive the probability distribution functions that quantify the non-Gaussian effects. Furthermore, we find that the deviation $q-1$ at a given stellar age follows non-random behaviour. As a result, the $q$-index behaviour indicates that the vertical component $W$, perpendicular to the Galactic plane, does not ``heat up'' at random, which is in disagreement with previous works that attributed the evolution of $W$ to randomness. Finally, our results bring a new perspective to this matter and open the way for studying Galactic kinematic components through the eyes of more robust statistical models that consider non-Gaussian effects.","Viana, C.

The urgency to deploy serological assays required rapid evaluation of their performance characteristics. We undertook an internal validation of a CE marked lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) (SureScreen Diagnostics) using serum from SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive individuals and pre-pandemic samples. This was followed by the delivery of a same-day named patient SARS-CoV-2 serology service using LFIA on vetted referrals at central London teaching hospital with clinical interpretation of result provided to the direct care team. Assay performance, source and nature of referrals, feasibility and clinical utility of the service, particularly benefit in clinical decision-making, were recorded. Sensitivity and specificity of LFIA were 96.1% and 99.3% respectively. 113 tests were performed on 108 participants during three-week pilot. 44% participants (n = 48) had detectable antibodies. Three main indications were identified for serological testing; new acute presentations potentially triggered by recent COVID-19 e.g. pulmonary embolism (n = 5), potential missed diagnoses in context of a recent COVID-19 compatible illness (n = 40), and making infection control or immunosuppression management decisions in persistently SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR positive individuals (n = 6). We demonstrate acceptable performance characteristics, feasibility and clinical utility of using a LFIA that detects anti-spike antibodies to deliver SARS-CoV-2 serology service in adults and children. Greatest benefit was seen where there is reasonable pre-test probability and results can be linked with clinical advice or intervention. Experience from this pilot can help inform practicalities and benefits of rapidly implementing new tests such as LFIAs into clinical service as the pandemic evolves.","Sweeney, Nicola; Merrick, Blair; Pedro Galão, Rui; Pickering, Suzanne; Botgros, Alina; Wilson, Harry D; Signell, Adrian W; Betancor, Gilberto; Tan, Mark Kia Ik; Ramble, John; Kouphou, Neophytos; Acors, Sam; Graham, Carl; Seow, Jeffrey; MacMahon, Eithne; Neil, Stuart J D; Malim, Michael H; Doores, Katie; Douthwaite, Sam; Batra, Rahul; Nebbia, Gaia; Edgeworth, Jonathan D",PLoS One,140,26

Our study aims to describe the outcomes and predictors of mortality of ARDS associated with Covid-19 within one university-based healthcare system. Methods: This was a retrospective study performed within one university-based healthcare system. An electronic medical record was used to identify 166 patients admitted to the ICU for ARDS in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection at three different hospitals. Baseline patient characteristics, ICU and hospital course information, ICU interventions, ventilator settings, and hospital complications were collected and analyzed using descriptive statistical techniques. Results: The 166 patients meeting inclusion criteria had an average age of 64.1 (± 14.8). No significant difference in mortality was identified with male vs. female gender (57.9% vs. 42.1%, p=0.852) or BMI (8.4 ± 0.9 vs. 12.1 ± 1.5, p=0.727). The majority of the patient cohort was identified as black (68.2%). The overall mortality of our cohort was 38.2%. Hyperlipidemia (p=0.011), coronary artery disease (0.034), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p=0.006) were all associated with higher mortality. Prone positioning was utilized in 42.8% of all patients, and ECMO in 6.0%. There was a significant difference of mortality between those with higher observed ventilator plateau pressures at 24 hours (25.7 vs. 23.1, p=0.010) and driving pressures at 24 hours (13.4 vs. 11.7, p=0.036). Conclusion: Covid-19 associated ARDS is associated with significant mortality. Physicians should be aware of pre-existing conditions that are potentially associated with worse outcomes so that they receive appropriate level of care in a timely manner. Lower plateau and driving pressures were associated with improved outcomes. Prospective studies are needed to guide Covid-19 associated ARDS management.","Vahdatpour, C.; De Young, S.; Ayyoub, J.; Jaber, J.

Clinical features of patients with COVID-19 have been described. However, risk factors leading to in-hospital deterioration and poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients with severe disease have not been well identified. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center cohort study, 1190 adult inpatients (&#8805; 18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and determined outcomes (discharged or died) were included from Wuhan Infectious Disease Hospital from December 29, 2019 to February 28, 2020. The final follow-up date was March 2, 2020. Clinical data including characteristics, laboratory and imaging information as well as treatments were extracted from electronic medical records and compared. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to explore the potential predictors associated with in-hospital deterioration and death. RESULTS: 1190 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included. Their median age was 57 years (interquartile range 47-67 years). Two hundred and sixty-one patients (22%) developed a severe illness after admission. Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that higher SOFA score (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.22-1.43, per score increase, p < 0.001 for deterioration and OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.11-1.53, per score increase, p = 0.001 for death), lymphocytopenia (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.13-2.89 p = 0.013 for deterioration; OR 4.44, 95% CI 1.26-15.87, p = 0.021 for death) on admission were independent risk factors for in-hospital deterioration from not severe to severe disease and for death in severe patients. On admission D-dimer greater than 1 µg/L (OR 3.28, 95% CI 1.19-9.04, p = 0.021), leukocytopenia (OR 5.10, 95% CI 1.25-20.78), thrombocytopenia (OR 8.37, 95% CI 2.04-34.44) and history of diabetes (OR 11.16, 95% CI 1.87-66.57, p = 0.008) were also associated with higher risks of in-hospital death in severe COVID-19 patients. Shorter time interval from illness onset to non-invasive mechanical ventilation in the survivors with severe disease was observed compared with non-survivors (10.5 days, IQR 9.25-11.0 vs. 16.0 days, IQR 11.0-19.0 days, p = 0.030). Treatment with glucocorticoids increased the risk of progression from not severe to severe disease (OR 3.79, 95% CI 2.39-6.01, p < 0.001). Administration of antiviral drugs especially oseltamivir or ganciclovir is associated with a decreased risk of death in severe patients (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.05-0.64, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: High SOFA score and lymphocytopenia on admission could predict that not severe patients would develop severe disease in-hospital. On admission elevated D-dimer, leukocytopenia, thrombocytopenia and diabetes were independent risk factors of in-hospital death in severe patients with COVID-19. Administration of oseltamivir or ganciclovir might be beneficial for reducing mortality in severe patients.","Liu, Jiao; Zhang, Sheng; Wu, Zhixiong; Shang, You; Dong, Xuan; Li, Guang; Zhang, Lidi; Chen, Yizhu; Ye, Xiaofei; Du, Hangxiang; Liu, Yongan; Wang, Tao; Huang, SiSi; Chen, Limin; Wen, Zhenliang; Qu, Jieming; Chen, Dechang",Ann Intensive Care,140,20

This multi-center prospective study was conducted to determine the incidence of neurological manifestations in hospitalized cases with COVID-19 and assess these symptoms as the predictors of severity and death. METHODS: Hospitalized males and females with COVID-19 who aged over 18 years were included in the study. They were examined by two neurologists at the time of admission. All survived cases were followed for 8 weeks after discharge and 16 weeks if their symptoms had no improvements. RESULTS: We included 873 participants. Of eligible cases, 122 individuals (13.97%) died during hospitalization. The most common non-neurological manifestations were fever (81.1%), cough (76.1%), fatigue (36.1%), and shortness of breath (27.6%). Aging, male gender, co-morbidity, smoking, hemoptysis, chest tightness, and shortness of breath were associated with increased odds of severe cases and/or mortality. There were 561 (64.3%) cases with smell and taste dysfunctions (hyposmia: 58.6%; anosmia: 41.4%; dysguesia: 100%). They were more common among females (69.7%) and non-smokers (66.7%). Hyposmia/anosmia and dysgeusia were found to be associated with reduced odds of severe cases and mortality. Myalgia (24.8%), headaches (12.6%), and dizziness (11.9%) were other common neurological symptoms. Headaches had negative correlation with severity and death due to COVID-19 but myalgia and dizziness were not associated. The cerebrovascular events (n = 10) and status epilepticus (n = 1) were other neurological findings. The partial or full recovery of smell and taste dysfunctions was found in 95.2% after 8 weeks and 97.3% after 16 weeks. The parosmia (30.9%) and phantosmia (9.0%) were also reported during 8 weeks of follow-up. Five cases with mild headaches and 5 cases with myalgia were reported after 16 weeks of discharge. The demyelinating myelitis (n = 1) and Guillain-Barré syndrome (n = 1) were also found during follow-up.

The stress associated with MV can damage the delicate epithelium in small airways and alveoli, which can cause complications resulting in ventilation-induced lung injuries (VILIs) in many cases, especially in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Therefore, efforts were directed to develop safe modes for MV. In our work, we propose a different approach to decrease injuries of epithelial cells (EpCs) upon MV. We alter EpCs' cytoskeletal structure to increase their survival rate during airway reopening conditions associated with MV. We tested two anti-inflammatory drugs dexamethasone (DEX) and transdehydroandrosterone (DHEA) to alter the cytoskeleton. Cultured rat L2 alveolar EpCs were exposed to airway reopening conditions using a parallel-plate perfusion chamber. Cells were exposed to a single bubble propagation to simulate stresses associated with mechanical ventilation in both control and study groups. Cellular injury and cytoskeleton reorganization were assessed via fluorescence microscopy, whereas cell topography was studied via atomic force microscopy (AFM). Our results indicate that culturing cells in media, DEX solution, or DHEA solution did not lead to cell death (static cultures). Bubble flows caused significant cell injury. Preexposure to DEX or DHEA decreased cell death significantly. The AFM verified alteration of cell mechanics due to actin fiber depolymerization. These results suggest potential beneficial effects of DEX and DHEA for ARDS treatment for patients with COVID-19. They are also critical for VILIs and applicable to future clinical studies.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Preexposure of cultured cells to either dexamethasone or transdehydroandrosterone significantly decreases cellular injuries associated with mechanical ventilation due to their ability to alter the cell mechanics. This is an alternative protective method against VILIs instead of common methods that rely on modification of mechanical ventilator modes.","Al-Ruweidi, Mahmoud Khatib A A; Ali, Fatma Hassan; Shurbaji, Samar; Popelka, Anton; Yalcin, Huseyin C",J Appl Physiol (1985),140,5

By measuring the arising times of these local extrema from the time-resolved harmonic signals, the rotational temperature and pump intensity can be accurately measured. We have demonstrated our method using N2 molecules. The validity and robustness of our method are tested with different harmonic orders and by changing the gas pressures as well as the distance between the gas exit and the optical axis.

However, that the real percentage of HCWs infected by SARS-CoV-2 in Egypt remains unknown. The researchers conducted the current study to assess seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG among HCWs working in a hospital with no SARS-CoV-2 patients, and to identify the potential factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity. DESIGN AND METHODS: The current study is a cross-sectional study carried out among 455 HCWs at Cairo University Hospital. The researchers administered a questionnaire shortly before the SARS-CoV-2 rapid test is performed using closed-ended question format to obtain information on demographic data of the study participants including age, sex, specialty, clinical information including questions about medical conditions, and. history of previous exposure with a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19, and history of COVID-19- compatible symptoms during the previous 14 days (cough, sore throat, runny nose, fatigue, shortness of breath, fever, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, anosmia, ageusia, and chills). RESULTS: We screened 455 HCWs for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 31.4% were in the high-risk group, and 68.6% in the low-risk group. The overall IgG seroprevalence was 36 (7.9%) (95% CI 5.8 to 10.8). The IgG seroprevalence was significantly higher in low-risk group 11% (35/312) versus high-risk group 0.7% (1/143), p<0.001. CONCLUSIONS: Low seropositivity rates for SARS-CoV-2 among HCWs is suggestive of lack of immunity and we are still far from herd immunity.","Mukhtar, Ahmed; Afishawy, Mostafa; Alkhatib, Engy; Hosny, Moushira; Yousef, Mohamed; Amal Elsayed, Amal; Salem, Marwa Rashad; Ghaith, Doaa",,140,15

METHODS: A prospective observational study including patients hospitalized for suspicion of COVID-19 in a COVID unit was performed from 20th March to 5th April 2020, in Perpignan, France. Patients for which there was a doubt upon diagnosis, who were recently under oral corticosteroids, had myeloid malignancy or human immunodeficient virus infection were excluded. SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed using an RT-PCR assay, from nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Complete blood count were performed for all patients. RESULTS: One-hundred and twenty-one patient were included: 57 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, 64 patients were not. Eosinophil count was lower in the COVID-19 group (median: 0/µL versus 70/µL, p < 0.0001). To diagnose COVID-19, eosinopenia had a sensitivity of 89.5% and a specificity of 78.1% while lymphopenia's were 73.7% and 62.5% respectively. Using area under curve (AUC) of receiving operating characteristics (ROC) curves, eosinophil's optimal cut-off level was 10/µL, sensitivity and specificity were 86%, and 79.7% respectively. Regarding the eosinophil/PMN ratio, the optimal cut-off level was 3.344, sensitivity and specificity were 87.7% and 73.4% respectively. The AUC of lymphocyte/PMN ratio was significantly lower than eosinophil/PMN ratio's (0.621 versus 0.846, p = 0.0003). CONCLUSION: Eosinopenia - <10/µL - and eosinophil/PMN ratio are useful, low-cost, reproducible tools to help diagnose COVID-19, during an epidemic period, in a population of hospitalized patients admitted for suspicion of COVID-19.","Outh, Roderau; Boutin, Caroline; Gueudet, Philippe; Suzuki, Marcelino; Saada, Matthieu; Aumaître, Hugues",J Microbiol Immunol Infect,140,29

Patients with pre-existing cardiac disease have more severe infection and associated mortality. Severe COVID-19 infection shows close association with myocardial damage and various arrythmias. The cardiovascular involvement occurs by either engagement directly with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 or indirectly by the effect of inflammatory mediators which are generated as a result of viral-host response to infection.

(COVID-19) is a serious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) The primary manifestation is respiratory insufficiency that can also be related to diffuse pulmonary microthrombosis in people with COVID-19 This disease also causes thromboembolic events, such as pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, catheter thrombosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy Recent studies have indicated a worse prognosis for people with COVID-19 who developed thromboembolism Anticoagulants are medications used in the prevention and treatment of venous or arterial thromboembolic events Several drugs are used in the prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic events, such as heparinoids (heparins or pentasaccharides), vitamin K antagonists and direct anticoagulants Besides their anticoagulant properties, heparinoids have an additional anti-inflammatory potential, that may affect the clinical evolution of people with COVID-19 Some practical guidelines address the use of anticoagulants for thromboprophylaxis in people with COVID-19, however, the benefit of anticoagulants for people with COVID-19 is still under debate Objectives: To assess the effects of prophylactic anticoagulants versus active comparator, placebo or no intervention, on mortality and the need for respiratory support in people hospitalised with COVID-19 Search methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and IBECS databases, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and medRxiv preprint database from their inception to 20 June 2020 We also checked reference lists of any relevant systematic reviews identified and contacted specialists in the field for additional references to trials Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cluster-RCTs and cohort studies that compared prophylactic anticoagulants (heparin, vitamin K antagonists, direct anticoagulants, and pentasaccharides) versus active comparator, placebo or no intervention for the management of people hospitalised with COVID-19 We excluded studies without a comparator group Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and need for additional respiratory support Secondary outcomes were mortality related to COVID-19, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, major bleeding, adverse events, length of hospital stay and quality of life Data collection and analysis: We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures We used ROBINS-I to assess risk of bias for non-randomised studies (NRS) and GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence We reported results narratively Main results: We identified no RCTs or quasi-RCTs that met the inclusion criteria We included seven retrospective NRS (5929 participants), three of which were available

Apresenta-se predominantemente com sintomas clínicos inaparentes e, por esse motivo, realiza-se o diagnóstico dessa afecção por meio da avaliação do leite utilizando-se métodos diretos, na identificação do agente etiológico, e indiretos, como o California Mastitis Test (CMT) e a Contagem de Células Somáticas (CCS). Entretanto, o diagnóstico por meio do CMT e da CCS nessa espécie animal deve ser cautelosa devido a algumas peculiaridades do leite das cabras, sendo recomendado a associação desses métodos com o exame microbiológico, o que nem sempre é possível. Frente às limitações dos meios diagnósticos empregados, ressalta-se a termografia infravermelha como um recurso aplicável na prática e cujo potencial na avaliação de processos inflamatórios da glândula mamária já foi demonstrado em estudos recentes nos bovinos. Diante disso, objetivou-se avaliar a utilização da câmera infravermelha como ferramenta auxiliar na identificação de infecção intramamária em caprinos. Para tal, avaliou-se 267 metades mamárias (134 cabras leiteiras), distribuindo-as de acordo com o resultado do exame microbiológico do leite, em grupo controle (metades mamárias com cultura microbiológica negativa) e grupo mastite (metades mamárias com cultura microbiológica positiva). Padronizou-se a vista caudal do úbere de todos os animais como aquela para se obter as imagens termográficas. Na avaliação dos termogramas obteve-se as temperaturas superficiais do úbere (TSU) dos animais, considerando-se a temperatura máxima (Tmax) e temperatura média (Tmed). Com a finalidade de delimitar uma área da região anatômica a ser mensurada, foram propostos métodos que utilizam três figuras geométricas de análise (círculos, linha e elipse). Inicialmente realizou-se a avaliação da TSU das glândulas mamárias do grupo controle (174 metades mamárias) por meio de modelo estatístico multivariável. Os resultados indicaram que a Tmed elipse e Tmed círculo ápice representavam os dois melhores métodos de avaliação da TSU e identificou-se os fatores que influenciavam a TSU como fase de lactação, temperatura retal, presença de pelos e diagnóstico para o vírus da artrite-encefalite caprina (CAE). A partir desses resultados, comparou-se a TSU dos grupos experimentais, por meio de modelos lineares mistos, ajustados com base nas variáveis explanatórias. Não se observou uma diferença estatisticamente significativa entre os grupos experimentais, demonstrando-se que a termografia infravermelha não identificou diferença nas temperaturas das metades mamárias de cabras com cultura microbiológica positiva. Entretanto, inesperadamente, observou-se que a temperatura dos animais soropositivos para CAE eram maiores que aquelas dos animais soronegativos, independente da presença de infecção intramamária. Isso demonstra uma possível aplicação da termografia infravermelha na avaliação dessa enfermidade e instiga à pesquisas futuras devido a importância dessa enfermidade para a caprinocultura.","SEINO, CAROLINE HARUMI",,140,20

Understanding the possible socioeconomic and ethnic health inequities is particularly important given the diverse population and fragile political and economic situation. We aimed to characterise the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil and assess variations in mortality according to region, ethnicity, comorbidities, and symptoms. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional observational study of COVID-19 hospital mortality using data from the SIVEP-Gripe (Sistema de Informação de Vigilância Epidemiológica da Gripe) dataset to characterise the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. In the study, we included hospitalised patients who had a positive RT-PCR test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and who had ethnicity information in the dataset. Ethnicity of participants was classified according to the five categories used by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics: Branco (White), Preto (Black), Amarelo (East Asian), Indígeno (Indigenous), or Pardo (mixed ethnicity). We assessed regional variations in patients with COVID-19 admitted to hospital by state and by two socioeconomically grouped regions (north and central-south). We used mixed-effects Cox regression survival analysis to estimate the effects of ethnicity and comorbidity at an individual level in the context of regional variation. FINDINGS: Of 99â557 patients in the SIVEP-Gripe dataset, we included 11â321 patients in our study. 9278 (82·0%) of these patients were from the central-south region, and 2043 (18·0%) were from the north region. Compared with White Brazilians, Pardo and Black Brazilians with COVID-19 who were admitted to hospital had significantly higher risk of mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1·45, 95% CI 1·33-1·58 for Pardo Brazilians; 1·32, 1·15-1·52 for Black Brazilians). Pardo ethnicity was the second most important risk factor (after age) for death. Comorbidities were more common in Brazilians admitted to hospital in the north region than in the central-south, with similar proportions between the various ethnic groups. States in the north had higher HRs compared with those of the central-south, except for Rio de Janeiro, which had a much higher HR than that of the other central-south states. INTERPRETATION: We found evidence of two distinct but associated effects: increased mortality in the north region (regional effect) and in the Pardo and Black populations (ethnicity effect). We speculate that the regional effect is driven by increasing comorbidity burden in regions with lower levels of socioeconomic development. The ethnicity effect might be related to differences in susceptibility to COVID-19 and access to health care (including intensive care) across ethnicities. Our analysis supports an urgent effort on the part of Brazilian authorities to consider how the national response to COVID-19 can better protect Pardo and Black Brazilians, as well as the population of poorer states, from their higher risk of dying of COVID-19.

In addition, it projects the jurisdiction-level trajectory of this pandemic by estimating case doubling times on April 7 and changes in cumulative incidence during the most recent 7-day period (March 31-April 7). As of April 7, 2020, a total of 395,926 cases of COVID-19, including 12,757 related deaths, were reported in the United States. Cumulative COVID-19 incidence varied substantially by jurisdiction, ranging from 20.6 cases per 100,000 in Minnesota to 915.3 in NYC. On April 7, national case doubling time was approximately 6.5 days, although this ranged from 5.5 to 8.0 days in the 10 jurisdictions reporting the most cases. Absolute change in cumulative incidence during March 31-April 7 also varied widely, ranging from an increase of 8.3 cases per 100,000 in Minnesota to 418.0 in NYC. Geographic differences in numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths, cumulative incidence, and changes in incidence likely reflect a combination of jurisdiction-specific epidemiologic and population-level factors, including 1) the timing of COVID-19 introductions; 2) population density; 3) age distribution and prevalence of underlying medical conditions among COVID-19 patients (1-3); 4) the timing and extent of community mitigation measures; 5) diagnostic testing capacity; and 6) public health reporting practices.

These aspects can be affected by urban vegetation and planting design but, while there are thousands of papers related to the effects of climate change, a relatively limited number of them are directly aimed at investigating the role of vegetation as a mitigating factor in the urban context. This paper focuses on reviewing the research on the role of urban vegetation in alleviating the adverse conditions of the urban environment in order to provide some practical guidelines to be applied by city planners. Through an analysis of the documents found in Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar using urban vegetation and climate change-related keywords we selected five major issues related to the urban environment: (1) particulate matter, (2) gaseous pollution, (3) noise pollution, (4) water runoff, (5) urban heat island effect. The analysis of existing knowledge reported here indicates that the roles of urban vegetation on the adverse effect of climate change could not be simply deemed positive or negative, because the role of urban green is also strongly linked to the structure, composition, and distribution of vegetation, as well as to the criteria used for management. Therefore, it could help to better understand the roles of urban green as a complex system and provide the foundation for future studies.","Ferrini, Francesco; Fini, Alessio; Mori, Jacopo; Gori, Antonella",Sustainability,140,3

The purpose of this study was to evaluate current guidelines for tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide a framework for health systems to prepare as the science evolves over the upcoming months and years. METHODS: Literature review was performed. Articles reporting clinical practice guidelines for tracheostomy in the context of COVID-19 were included. RESULTS: A total of 13 tracheotomy guidelines were identified. Two were available via PubMed, five in society or organization websites, and six identified via health system websites or other sources. Five were from Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery specialties, six from Anesthesiology and one from Pulmonary/Critical Care. All (100%) studies recommended postponing elective OR cases in COVID-19 positive patients, while seven recommended reducing team members to only essential staff and three recommended forming a designated tracheostomy team. Recommendations with supporting references are summarized in the article. CONCLUSIONS: Tracheostomy guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic vary by physician groups and specialty, hospital systems, and supply-chain/resource availability. This summary is provided as a point-in-time current state of the guidelines for tracheotomy management in April 2020 and is expected to change in coming weeks and months as the COVID-19 pandemic, virus testing and antibody testing evolves.","Heyd, Cameron P; Desiato, Vincent M; Nguyen, Shaun A; O039,; Rourke, Ashli K; Clemmens, Clarice S; Awad, Mahmoud I; Worley, Mitchell L; Day, Terry A",Head Neck,140,29

METHODS: Four hundred eleven participants (Mageâ¯=â¯68.95, S.D.â¯=â¯5.60) completed questionnaires at two time points - before the pandemic and during the lockdown period. Cross-lagged analysis was carried out on two structural equation models - social isolation and anxiety symptoms, and QoL and anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: Baseline social isolation was associated with more anxiety symptoms at follow-up. However, baseline anxiety symptoms were not associated with social isolation subsequently. For QoL and anxiety symptoms, the relationship was bidirectional. CONCLUSION: Older adults who were previously socially isolated and had a lower QoL are particularly vulnerable to the negative psychological impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown.","Siew, Savannah Kiah Hui; Mahendran, Rathi; Yu, Junhong",Am. j. geriatr. psychiatry,140,16

Specifically, by studying a variational equation for the dynamics of the infected in a network model of the epidemic spread, we derive, using contractivity arguments, a condition that can be used to guarantee that, in epidemiological terms, the effective reproduction number is less than unity. This condition has three advantages: (i) it is easily computable; (ii) it is directly related to the model parameters; (iii) it can be used to enforce a scalability condition that prohibits the amplification of disturbances within the network system. We then include satisfaction of such a condition as a constraint in a Model Predictive Control problem so as to mitigate (or suppress) the spread of the epidemic while minimizing the economic impact of the interventions. A data-driven model of Italy as a network of three macro-regions (North, Center, and South), whose parameters are identified from real data, is used to illustrate and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.","Coraggio, Marco; Xie, Shihao; Lellis, Francesco De; Russo, Giovanni; Bernardo, Mario di",,140,22

However, few studies have examined whether Saharan dust intrusions influence the incidence and severity of COVID-19 cases. To address this question, in this study we carried out generalized linear models with Poisson link between incidence rates and daily hospital admissions and average daily concentrations of PM10, NO2, and O3 in nine Spanish regions for the period from February 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. The models were adjusted by maximum daily temperature and average daily absolute humidity. Furthermore, we controlled for trend, seasonality, and the autoregressive nature of the series. The variable relating to Saharan dust intrusions was introduced using a dichotomous variable, NAF, averaged across daily lags in ranges of 0-7 days, 8-14 days, 14-21 days, and 22-28 days. The results obtained in this study suggest that chemical air pollutants, and especially NO2, are related to the incidence and severity of COVID-19 in Spain. Furthermore, Saharan dust intrusions have an additional effect beyond what is attributable to the variation in air pollution; they are related, in different lags, to both the incidence and hospital admissions rates for COVID-19. These results serve to support public health measures that minimize population exposure on days with particulate matter advection from the Sahara.","Linares, Cristina; Culqui, Dante; Belda, Fernando; López-Bueno, José Antonio; Luna, Yolanda; Sánchez-Martínez, Gerardo; Hervella, Beatriz; Díaz, Julio",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

Method: A large sample of adults who had sustained mild, moderate or severe TBIs seven months prior (N = 165) and a control group (N = 106) underwent DTI and cognitive testing. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were calculated for 5 regions (corpus callosum: genu, body, splenium; fornix; superior longitudinal fasciculus) that recent meta-analyses identified as being affected by TBI and related to cognition following TBI. Memory, attention and executive functioning, which are often affected by TBI, were assessed. Results: Overall, mild TBI did not show significant WM or cognitive changes, relative to controls, but moderate to severe TBI was associated with large WM alterations (all regions) and poorer cognitive performance. No significant correlations were found between DTI findings and cognition in the moderate to severe group. Conclusions: The findings have shown that moderate to severe TBI leads to considerable WM and cognitive changes. Early and ongoing examination of mild TBI is needed to determine whether WM and cognitive changes are initially present and, if so, when they resolve.

METHODS: This work quantifies the transmission of radiation through a glass barrier using six radiographic systems at five facilities. Patient entrance air kerma (EAK) and effective dose were estimated both with and without the glass barrier. Beam penetrability and resulting exposure index (EI) and deviation index (DI) were measured and used to adjust the tube current‐time product (mAs) for glass barriers. Because of beam hardening, the contrast‐to‐noise ratio (CNR) was measured with image quality phantoms to ensure diagnostic integrity. Finally, scatter surveys were performed to assess staff radiation exposure both inside and outside the exam room. RESULTS: The glass barriers attenuated a mean of 61% of the normal X‐ray beams. When the mAs was increased to match EI values, there was no discernible degradation of image quality as determined by the CNR. This was corroborated with subjective assessments of image quality by chest radiologists. The glass‐hardened beams acted as a filter for low energy X‐rays, and some facilities observed slight changes in patient effective doses. There was scattering from both the phantoms and the glass barriers within the room. CONCLUSIONS: Glass barriers require an approximate 2.5 times increase in beam intensity, with all other technique factors held constant. Further refinements are necessary for increased source‐to‐image distance and beam quality in order to adequately match EI values. This does not result in a significant increase in the radiation dose delivered to the patient. The use of lead aprons, mobile shields, and increased distance from scattering sources should be employed where practicable in order to keep staff radiation doses as low as reasonably achievable.","McKenney, Sarah E.; Wait, John M.

The Experimental Animal Division, one of the BRC infrastructure divisions, has been designated as the core facility for mouse resources within the National BioResource Project (NBRP) by the Japanese government since FY2002. Our activities regarding the collection, preservation, quality control, and distribution of mouse resources have been supported by the research community, including evaluations and guidance on advancing social and research needs, as well as the operations and future direction of the BRC. Expenditure for collection, preservation, and quality-control operations of the BRC, as a national core facility, has been funded by the government, while distribution has been separately funded by users’ reimbursement fees. We have collected over 9000 strains created mainly by Japanese scientists including Nobel laureates and researchers in cutting-edge fields and distributed mice to 7000 scientists with 1500 organizations in Japan and globally. Our users have published 1000 outstanding papers and a few dozen patents. The collected mouse resources are accessible via the RIKEN BRC website, with a revised version of the searchable online catalog. In addition, to enhance the visibility of useful strains, we have launched web corners designated as the “Mouse of the Month” and “Today’s Tool and Model.” Only high-demand strains are maintained in live colonies, while other strains are cryopreserved as embryos or sperm to achieve cost-effective management. Since 2007, the RIKEN BRC has built up a back-up facility in the RIKEN Harima branch to protect the deposited strains from disasters. Our mice have been distributed with high quality through the application of strict microbial and genetic quality control programs that cover a globally accepted pathogens list and mutated alleles generated by various methods. Added value features, such as information about users’ publications, standardized phenotyping data, and genome sequences of the collected strains, are important to facilitate the use of our resources. We have added and disseminated such information in collaboration with the NBRP Information Center and the NBRP Genome Information Upgrading Program. The RIKEN BRC has participated in international mouse resource networks such as the International Mouse Strain Resource, International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium, and Asian Mouse Mutagenesis and Resource Association to facilitate the worldwide use of high-quality mouse resources, and as a consequence it contributes to reproducible life science studies and innovation around the globe.","Mizuno-Iijima, Saori; Nakashiba, Toshiaki; Ayabe, Shinya; Nakata, Hatsumi; Ike, Fumio; Hiraiwa, Noriko; Mochida, Keiji; Ogura, Atsuo; Masuya, Hiroshi; Kawamoto, Shoko; Tamura, Masaru; Obata, Yuichi; Shiroishi, Toshihiko; Yoshiki, Atsushi",Mamm Genome,140,20

The role of the SARS-CoV-2 components on innate and adaptive immunity is still unknown. We investigated the possible implication of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)–pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) interaction. (2) Methods: We infected Calu-3/MRC-5 multicellular spheroids (MTCSs) with a SARS-CoV-2 clinical strain and evaluated the activation of RNA sensors, transcription factors, and cytokines/interferons (IFN) secretion, by quantitative real-time PCR, immunofluorescence, and ELISA. (3) Results: Our results showed that the SARS-CoV-2 infection of Calu-3/MRC-5 multicellular spheroids induced the activation of the TLR3 and TLR7 RNA sensor pathways. In particular, TLR3 might act via IRF3, producing interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, and IFN-α and IFN-β, during the first 24 h post-infection. Then, TLR3 activates the NFκB transduction pathway, leading to pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Conversely, TLR7 seems to mainly act via NFκB, inducing type 1 IFN, IFN-γ, and IFN-λ3, starting from the 48 h post-infection. (4) Conclusion: We showed that both TLR3 and TLR7 are involved in the control of innate immunity during lung SARS-CoV-2 infection. The activation of TLRs induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-4, and IL-6, as well as interferons. TLRs could be a potential target in controlling the infection in the early stages of the disease.","Bortolotti, Daria; Gentili, Valentina; Rizzo, Sabrina; Schiuma, Giovanna; Beltrami, Silvia; Strazzabosco, Giovanni; Fernandez, Mercedes; Caccuri, Francesca; Caruso, Arnaldo; Rizzo, Roberta",Microorganisms,140,17

FDA‐approved anti‐parasite drug ivermectin is also an antibacterial, antiviral, and anticancer agent, which offers more potentiality to improve global public health, and it can effectively inhibit the replication of SARS‐CoV‐2 in vitro. This study sought to identify ivermectin‐related virus infection pathway alterations in human ovarian cancer cells. Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) quantitative proteomics was used to analyze human ovarian cancer cells TOV‐21G treated with and without ivermectin (20 μmol/L) for 24 h, which identified 4447 ivermectin‐related proteins in ovarian cancer cells. Pathway network analysis revealed four statistically significant antiviral pathways, including HCMV, HPV, EBV, and HIV1 infection pathways. Interestingly, compared with the reported 284 SARS‐CoV‐2/COVID‐19‐related genes from GencLip3, we identified 52 SARS‐CoV‐2/COVID‐19‐related protein alterations when treated with and without ivermectin. Protein–protein network (PPI) was constructed based on the interactions between 284 SARS‐CoV‐2/COVID‐19‐related genes and between 52 SARS‐CoV‐2/COVID‐19‐related proteins regulated by ivermectin. Molecular complex detection analysis of PPI network identified three hub modules, including cytokines and growth factor family, MAP kinase and G‐protein family, and HLA class proteins. Gene Ontology analysis revealed 10 statistically significant cellular components, 13 molecular functions, and 11 biological processes. These findings demonstrate the broad‐spectrum antiviral property of ivermectin benefiting for COVID‐19 treatment in the context of predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine in virus‐related diseases.","Li, Na; Zhao, Lingfeng; Zhan, Xianquan",J Cell Physiol,140,5

In this study, we generated a cold-adapted live attenuated vaccine candidate (Aram-P29-CA) by short-term passage of a virulent PEDV isolate at successively lower temperatures in Vero cells. Whole genome sequencing identified 12 amino acid changes in the cold-adapted strain with no insertions and deletions throughout the genome. Animal inoculation experiments confirmed the attenuated phenotype of Aram-P29-CA virus in the natural host. Pregnant sows were orally administered P29-CA live vaccines two doses at 2-week intervals prior to parturition, and the newborn piglets were challenged with the parental virus. The oral homologous prime-boost vaccination of P29-CA significantly improved the survival rate of the piglets and notably mitigated the severity of diarrhea and PEDV fecal shedding after the challenge. Furthermore, strong antibody responses to PEDV were detected in the sera and colostrum of immunized sows and in the sera of their offspring. These results demonstrated that the cold-adapted attenuated virus can be used as a live vaccine in maternal vaccination strategies to provide durable lactogenic immunity and confer passive protection to litters against PEDV.","Won, Hokeun; Lee, Dong-Uk; Jang, Guehwan; Noh, Yun-Hee; Lee, Seung-Chul; Choi, Hwan-Won; Yoon, In-Joong; Yoo, Han Sang; Lee, Changhee",J Vet Sci,140,22

Among the measures to mitigate the risk of diarrhea outbreaks, cow vaccination stands out as one of the most important. However, the immune pressure resulting from routine vaccination may be able to select specific G and P genotypes in RVA field strains. This study aimed to determine the frequency and intensity of neonatal diarrhea and the incidence of RVA and attempted to monitor the G and P genotypes present in the RVA strains circulating in a high milk yield cattle herd vaccinated with RVA G6P[5] strain. Fecal samples (n = 1220) from 122 Holstein heifer calves between 0–30 days old that were born from RVA-vaccinated cows were collected at 10 different time points, regardless of the presence or absence of diarrhea. The presence of RVA in fecal samples was determined by the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) technique and confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). G and P amplicons from 10 RVA-positive fecal samples from calves of different ages and collections were subjected to nucleotide sequencing. The proportion of the calves and fecal samples that were positive for RVA were 62.3% (76/122) and 8.1% (99/1220), respectively. Using sequence analysis, all 10 RVA field strains presented genotype G10P[11]. The protection of G6P[5] vaccination is clear, as this genotype was not detected in this study, and it is known that vaccination against RVA reduces the incidence of diarrhea independent of genotype involved. This result demonstrates the importance of epidemiological monitoring of RVA genotypes circulating in vaccinated dairy cattle herds to the early detection of new potential pathogenic RVA strains.","Fritzen, Juliana T.T.; Oliveira, Marcos V.; Lorenzetti, Elis; Miyabe, Flávia M.; Viziack, Mariana P.; Rodrigues, Carlos A.; Ayres, Henderson; Alfieri, Alice F.; Alfieri, Amauri A.",Vet Microbiol,140,20

However, the association between such changes and maternal mental health has not been examined, and comparable pre-COVID-19 baseline data were lacking. Thus, we aimed to examine the relationships between changes due to COVID-19 pandemic and the development of depressive and anxiety symptoms among mothers of infants and/or preschoolers in Japan. DESIGN: Prospective follow-up study. The baseline survey was conducted in February 2020, and the follow-up survey was conducted in June 2020. SETTING: All 47 prefectures in Japan. PARTICIPANTS: At the baseline, 4700 mothers of infants and/or preschoolers (0–6 years) participated in the online survey (100 respondents per prefecture); 2489 of them also participated in the follow-up survey. After excluding 203 participants with a higher risk of severe mental illness at the baseline, 2286 were included in the analysis. OUTCOME MEASURES: The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale was used to measure depressive and anxiety symptoms, with a cut-off point of 13 or more. We estimated the adjusted OR (AOR) using multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 151 (6.6%) of respondents newly developed depressive and anxiety symptoms. Participants who experienced a shortage of relaxation time (AOR 1.61, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.47), increased difficulty in child rearing (AOR 1.89, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.70), increased partner aggression (AOR 2.93, 95% CI 1.42 to 6.05) and an increased sense of unfairness (AOR 1.74, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.73) were more likely to develop these symptoms.

This analysis evaluated safety based on more recent cutoff dates and a longer palbociclib treatment exposure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were pooled from three randomized studies of patients with hormone receptor‐positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2‐negative (HR+/HER2−) advanced breast cancer (ABC), including postmenopausal women who had not received prior systemic treatment for advanced disease (PALOMA‐1/‐2) and pre‐ and postmenopausal women who had progressed on prior ET (PALOMA‐3). RESULTS: Updated cutoff dates were December 21, 2017 (PALOMA‐1), May 31, 2017 (PALOMA‐2), and April 13, 2018 (PALOMA‐3). Total person‐years of treatment exposure were 1,421.6 with palbociclib plus ET (n = 872) and 528.4 with ET (n = 471). Any‐grade neutropenia and infections were more frequent with palbociclib plus ET (82.1% and 59.2%, respectively) than with ET (5.1% and 39.5%). The hazard ratios were 1.6 (p = .0995) for grade 3/4 infections, 1.8 (p = .4358) for grade 3/4 viral infections, 1.4 (p = .0001) for infections, and 30.8 (p < .0001) for neutropenia. Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.4% of patients receiving palbociclib plus ET. Cumulative incidence of all‐grade hematologic adverse events in both arms peaked during the first year of treatment and plateaued over the 5 subsequent years. Interstitial lung disease was reported in 13 patients receiving palbociclib plus ET and 3 receiving ET. CONCLUSION: This 5‐year, long‐term analysis demonstrated that palbociclib plus ET has a consistent and stable safety profile and is a safe treatment for patients with HR+/HER2− ABC. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Several treatments for patients with breast cancer are associated with long‐term or latent adverse events. This long‐term, 5‐year analysis demonstrated that palbociclib plus endocrine therapy has a consistent and stable safety profile without cumulative or delayed toxicities. These results further support palbociclib plus endocrine therapy as a safe and manageable treatment in clinical practice for patients with hormone receptor‐positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2‐negative advanced breast cancer.","Finn, Richard S.; Rugo, Hope S.; Gelmon, Karen A.; Cristofanilli, Massimo; Colleoni, Marco; Loi, Sherene; Schnell, Patrick; Lu, Dongrui R.; Theall, Kathy Puyana; Mori, Ave; Gauthier, Eric; Bananis, Eustratios; Turner, Nicholas C.; Diéras, Véronique",Oncologist,140,20

The inability to inhale and exhale is one of the difficult conditions for a person suffering from respiratory disorders. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of respiratory disorders with the presently available imaging and auditory screening modalities are sub-optimal and the accuracy of diagnosis varies with different medical experts. At present, deep neural nets demand a massive amount of data suitable for precise models. In reality, the respiratory data set is quite limited, and therefore, data augmentation (DA) is employed to enlarge the data set. In this study, conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN) based DA is utilized for synthetic generation of signals. The publicly available repository such as ICBHI 2017 challenge, RALE and Think Labs Lung Sounds Library are considered for classifying the respiratory signals. To assess the efficacy of the artificially created signals by the DA approach, similarity measures are calculated between original and augmented signals. After that, to quantify the performance of augmentation in classification, scalogram representation of generated signals are fed as input to different pre-trained deep learning architectures viz Alexnet, GoogLeNet and ResNet-50. The experimental results are computed and performance results are compared with existing classical approaches of augmentation.

Phenothiazine slightly inhibited SARS-CoV replication in a neutral red (NR) uptake assay. Adding a propylamino group to give promazine reduced virus yields (VYR assay) with an EC(90) = 8.3 ± 2.8 µM, but without selectivity. Various substitutions in the basic phenothiazine structure did not promote efficacy. Phenazine ethosulfate was the most potent compound by VYR assay (EC(90) = 6.1 ± 4.3 µM). All compounds were toxic (IC(50) = 6.6–74.5 µM) except for phenoxathiin (IC(50) = 858 ± 208 µM) and 10-(alpha-diethylamino-propionyl) phenothiazine·HCl (IC(50) = 195 ± 71.2 µM). Consequently, none were selective inhibitors of SARS-CoV replication (SI values <1–3.3 µM). These data portended the poor efficacy of promazine in a SARS-CoV mouse lung replication model. Intraperitoneal treatment with promazine using a prophylactic (−4 h)/therapeutic regimen of 1, 10, or 50 mg/(kg day) did not reduce virus lung titers at day 3, yet prolonged virus replication to 14 days.

Previous investigations have shown that the MHV spike (S) protein is a critical determinant of viral tropism and pathogenicity in mice and rats. To understand the molecular basis of MHV neuropathogenesis, we studied the spike protein gene sequences of several neutralization-resistant variants of the JHM strain of MHV, which were selected with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for the S protein. We found that variant 2.2-V-1, which was selected with MAb J.2.2 and primarily caused demyelination, had a single point mutation at nucleotide (NT) 3340, as compared to the parental JHM virus, which predominantly caused encephalitis. This site was in the S2 subunit of the S protein. In contrast, variant 7.2-V-1, which was selected with MAb J.7.2 and primarily caused encephalitis, had two point mutations at NT 1766 and 1950, which were in the S1 subunit. Finally, the double mutant 2.2/7.2-V-2, which was selected with both MAbs J.2.2 and J.7.2, and was attenuated with respect to both virulence and the ability to cause demyelination, had a deletion spanning from NT 1523 to 1624 in the S1 and a point mutation at NT 3340 in the S2. We conclude that at least two regions of the S protein contribute to neuropathogenicity of MHV. We have also isolated a partial revertant of 2.2-V-1, which was partially resistant to MAb 1.2.2 but retained the same neuropathogenicity as the variant 2.2-V-1. This revenant retained the mutation at NT 3340, but had a second-site mutation at NT 1994, further confirming that NT 3340 contributed to the pathogenic phenotype of MHV. By comparing these results with MHV variants isolated in other laboratories, which had mutations in other sites on the S gene and yet retained the demyelinating ability, we suggest that the ability of JHM viruses to induce demyelination is determined by the interaction of multiple sites on the S gene, rather than the characteristics of a single, unique site. Our study also revealed the possible presence of microheterogeneity of S gene sequence, particularly in the S1 region, in these viruses. The sequence microheterogeneity may also contribute to the differences in their biological properties.","Wang, F.-I.; Fleming, John O.; Lai, Michael M.C.",Virology,140,1

This review focuses on that subset of ATMPs. One key mode of delivery that has enabling potential in ATMP validation is aerosol-mediated delivery. The selection of the most appropriate aerosol generator technology is influenced by several key factors, including formulation, patient type, patient intervention, and healthcare economics. The aerosol-mediated delivery of ATMPs has shown promise for the treatment of both chronic and acute respiratory disease in pre-clinical and clinical trials; however, in order for these ATMP device combinations to translate from the bench through to commercialization, they must meet the requirements set out by the various global regulatory bodies.

Dwindling supplies, such as face masks, gowns and goggles, and inadequate production to meet increasing demand have placed health care workers and patients at risk. The momentum of the #GetMePPE Twitter hashtag resulted in the creation of a petition to urge public officials to address the PPE shortage through increased funding and production. Simultaneously, the GetUsPPE.org website was launched through the collaboration of physicians and software engineers to develop a digital platform for the donation, request, and distribution of multi-modal sources of PPE. GetUsPPE.org and #GetMePPE were merged in an attempt to combine public engagement and advocacy on social media with the coordination of PPE donation and distribution. Within 10 days, over 1800 hospitals and PPE suppliers were registered in a database that enabled the rapid coordination and distribution of scarce and in-demand materials. One month after its launch, the organization had distributed hundreds of thousands of PPE items and had built a database of over 6000 PPE requesters. The call for action on social media and the rapid development of this digital tool created a productive channel for the public to contribute to the health care response to COVID-19 in meaningful ways. #GetMePPE and GetUsPPE.org were able to mobilize individuals and organizations outside of the health care system to address the unmet needs of the medical community.

This work depicts a real-world practice experience by the French neuropathology network of incorporating DNA methylation profiling into the diagnostic process of challenging pediatric CNS tumors. After two rounds of histopathological review by neuropathology experts—including morphology, neuroimaging, immunohistochemistry, panel sequencing and FISH—62 tumors still presenting diagnostic uncertainty were selected for DNA methylation profiling. Using the DKFZ “classifier” and combining all additional information obtained from DNA methylation array, we observed significant diagnostic refinements and amendments. DNA methylation was successful in a significant number of cases (71%) despite the complex specificities of the cohort. Our study evaluates how DNA methylation testing would impact diagnosis and presents illustrative and representative cases. ABSTRACT: DNA methylation profiling has recently emerged as a powerful tool to help establish diagnosis in neuro-oncology. Here we present our national diagnostic strategy as the French neuropathology network (RENOCLIP-LOC) and our current approach of integrating DNA methylation profiling into our multistep diagnostic process for challenging pediatric CNS tumors. The tumors with diagnostic uncertainty were prospectively selected for DNA methylation after two rounds of review by neuropathology experts. We first integrated the classifier score into the histopathological findings. Subsequent analyses using t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) representation were performed. An additional step consisted of analyzing copy-number variation data (CNV). Finally, we combined all data to establish diagnoses and evaluated the impact of DNA methylation profiling on diagnostic and grading changes that would affect patient management. Over two years, 62 pediatric tumors were profiled. (1) Integrating the classifier score to the histopathological findings impacted the diagnosis in 33 cases (53%). (2) t-SNE analysis provided arguments for diagnosis in 26/35 cases with calibrated scores <0.84 (74.3%). (3) CNV investigations also evidenced alterations used for diagnosis and prognostication. (4) A diagnosis was finally established for 44 tumors (71%). Our results support the use of DNA methylation for challenging pediatric tumors. We demonstrated how additional methylation-based analyses complement the classifier score to support conventional histopathological diagnosis.","Pages, Melanie; Uro-Coste, Emmanuelle; Colin, Carole; Meyronet, David; Gauchotte, Guillaume; Maurage, Claude-Alain; Rousseau, Audrey; Godfraind, Catherine; Mokhtari, Karima; Silva, Karen; Figarella-Branger, Dominique; Varlet, Pascale",Cancers (Basel),140,30

Data were collected from integrated health system records for all hospitals affiliated with the Ilam University of Medical Sciences between 26-Jan-2020 and 02-May-2020. All patients with a confirmed positive test were included in this study. Descriptive analyses, chi-square test, and binary logistic regression model were performed by using SPSS version 22. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 46.47 ± 18.24 years. Of the 3608 patients, 3477 (96.1%) were discharged, and 129 (3.9%) died. 54.2% of the patients were male and were in the age group of 30–40 years. Cough, sore throat, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, and fever or chills were the most common symptoms. Patients with symptoms of shortness of breath, abnormal radiographic findings of the chest, and chest pain and pressure were relatively more likely to die. According to binary logistic regression results, the probability of death in patients with shortness of breath, abnormal chest radiographic findings, and chest pain was 1.34, 1.24, and 1.32 times higher, respectively, than for those without.

Our primary outcome was a COVID-19 outbreak ([â¥]1 resident or staff confirmed case by validated nucleic acid amplification assay). We used time-dependent proportional hazards methods to model the associations between retirement home and community level characteristics and COVID-19 outbreaks. ResultsOur cohort included all 770 licensed retirement homes in Ontario, which housed 56,491 residents.

COVID-19 cases were distributed unevenly across retirement homes, with 1,593 (92.2%) resident and staff cases occurring in 77 (10%) of homes. The adjusted hazard of a COVID-19 outbreak in a retirement home was positively associated with homes that had a large resident capacity, homes that were co-located with a long-term care facility, large corporate owned chains, homes that offered many services onsite, increases in regional COVID-19 incidence, and a higher community-level ethnic concentration. InterpretationReadily identifiable retirement home-level characteristics are independently associated with COVID-19 outbreaks and may support risk identification.

METHODS The Personal Diet Study is an ongoing randomized clinical trial which aims to compare two mobile health (mHealth) weight loss approaches, standardized diet vs. personalized feedback, on glycemic response. Over a six-month period, participants attended dietitian-led group meetings via remote videoconferencing and were encouraged to self-monitor dietary intake using a smartphone app. Descriptive statistics were used to report adherence to counseling sessions and self-monitoring. Challenges were tracked during weekly project meetings. RESULTS Challenges in connecting to and engaging in the videoconferencing sessions were noted. To address these issues, we provided a step-by-step user manual and video tutorials regarding use of WebEx, encouraged alternative means to join sessions, and sent reminder emails/texts about the WebEx sessions and asking participants to join sessions early. Self-monitoring app-related issue included inability to find specific foods in the app database. To overcome this, the study team incorporated commonly consumed foods as ""favorites"" in the app database, provided a manual and video tutorials regarding use of the app and checked the self-monitoring app dashboard weekly to identify nonadherent participants and intervened as appropriate.

Methods This prospective, case-control study of emergency medicine resident physicians was designed to assess the time taken by each subject to perform endotracheal intubation using both direct laryngoscopy (DL) and video laryngoscopy (VL), as well as peripheral IV cannulation both with and without ultrasound guidance and with and without PPE. Results While median times were higher using VL as compared to DL, there was no significant difference between intubation with either DL or VL in subjects with and without Level C PPE. Similarly, no significant difference in time was found for intravenous cannulation in the PPE and no-PPE groups, both with and without ultrasound guidance. Conclusions Existing skill proficiency was maintained despite wearing PPE and there was no advantage with the addition of adjuncts such as video-assisted laryngoscopy and ultrasound-guided intravenous cannulation. A safe and cost-effective strategy might be to conduct basic, just-in-time PPE training to enhance familiarity with donning, doffing, and mobility, and couple this with the use of personnel who have maximal proficiency in the relevant emergency skill, instead of more expensive, continuous, skills-focused PPE training.","Sule, Harsh; Kulkarni, Miriam; Sugalski, Gregory; Murano, Tiffany",Cureus,140,20

Emerging evidence suggests that metabolic risk factors may also vary by age. This study aimed to determine the association between common patient characteristics and mortality across age-groups among COVID-19 inpatients. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients discharged from hospitals in the Premier Healthcare Database between April – June 2020. Inpatients were identified using COVID-19 ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes. A priori-defined exposures were sex and present-on-admission hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and interactions between age and these comorbidities. Controlling for additional confounders, we evaluated relationships between these variables and in-hospital mortality in a log-binomial model. RESULTS: Among 66,646 (6.5%) admissions with a COVID-19 diagnosis, across 613 U.S. hospitals, 12,388 (18.6%) died in-hospital. In multivariable analysis, male sex was independently associated with 30% higher mortality risk (aRR, 1.30, 95% CI: 1.26 – 1.34). Diabetes without chronic complications was not a risk factor at any age (aRR 1.01, 95% CI: 0.96 – 1.06), and hypertension without chronic complications was only a risk factor in 20-39 year-olds (aRR, 1.68, 95% CI: 1.17 – 2.40). Diabetes with chronic complications, hypertension with chronic complications, and obesity were risk factors in most age-groups, with highest relative risks among 20-39 year-olds (respective aRRs 1.79, 2.33, 1.92; p-values ≤ 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized men with COVID-19 are at increased risk of death across all ages. Hypertension, diabetes with chronic complications, and obesity demonstrated age-dependent effects, with the highest relative risks among adults aged 20-39.","Goodman, Katherine E; Magder, Laurence S; Baghdadi, Jonathan D; Pineles, Lisa; Levine, Andrea R; Perencevich, Eli N; Harris, Anthony D",Clin Infect Dis,140,29

The Alinity m instrument by Abbott is capable of detecting several clinically relevant pathogens and has recently received FDA emergency use authorization for SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing. The Alinity m performs automatic sample preparation, RT-PCR assembly, amplification, detection, and result calculation in under two hours. Here, we validate the performance characteristics of the Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 assay in comparison with the Roche cobas 6800 and Hologic Panther Fusion platforms. Across 178 positive and 195 negative nasopharyngeal swab specimens (C(T) range 14.30-38.84), the Alinity m detected one additional positive specimen that was found to be negative on the Roche cobas 6800 (PPA 100%, NPA 99.5%). Across a separate set of 30 positive and 174 negative nasopharyngeal swab specimens (C(T) range 14.1-38.5), the Alinity m had 100% positive and negative agreement with the Hologic Panther Fusion. Using SeraCare SARS-CoV-2 RNA standards, the assay limit of detection was verified to be two-fold more sensitive than the parameters stated by the SARS-CoV-2 AMP kit package insert, at 50 virus copies/mL. Assay specificity was 100% over 20 specimens positive for other respiratory viruses and intraday precision was 100% concordant with <2% CV. These data indicate the Abbott Alinity m system's high concordance with reference assays and exquisite sensitivity distinguishes the platform's suitability for SARS-CoV-2 molecular detection.","Perchetti, Garrett A.; Pepper, Gregory; Shrestha, Lasata; LaTurner, Katrina; Yae Kim, Da; Huang, Meei-Li; Jerome, Keith R.; Greninger, Alexander L.",J Clin Virol,140,3

This paper used two-dimensional time-resolved particle image velocimetry (2D TR-PIV) to measure the exhaled flow from a breathing thermal manikin. Since the exhaled flow is transient and periodic, the phase-averaged method was used to analyze the flow characteristics. The results showed that the velocity profile of the flow exiting the mouth was bell-shaped for exhalation and flat for inhalation. The exhaled flow showed different characteristics during each stage of the exhalation process. In the initial phase, a mushroom-shaped flow arose, while some jet characteristics appeared in the middle phase. The effect of thermal buoyancy and thermal plume on the exhaled flow was analyzed. Clear turbulence characteristics were found in the exhaled flow, and the turbulence fluctuation was very strong in the transition stage between exhalation and inhalation. The last finding was that the distribution and value of vorticity were different in each phase. The results of quantitative PIV provided detailed information about the boundary condition set and validation data for CFD simulation.","Feng, Lianyuan; Yao, Shiyong; Sun, Hejiang; Jiang, Nan; Liu, Junjie",Build Environ,140,24

Vaccines are the most cost-effective means of preventing this spread. Traditional methods used to identify and produce new vaccines are not adequate, in most instances, to ensure global protection. New technologies are urgently needed to expedite large scale vaccine development. mRNA-based vaccines promise to meet this need. mRNA-based vaccines exhibit a number of potential advantages relative to conventional vaccines, namely they (1) involve neither infectious elements nor a risk of stable integration into the host cell genome; (2) generate humoral and cell-mediated immunity; (3) are well-tolerated by healthy individuals; and (4) are less expensive and produced more rapidly by processes that are readily standardized and scaled-up, improving responsiveness to large emerging outbreaks. Multiple mRNA vaccine platforms have demonstrated efficacy in preventing infectious diseases and treating several types of cancers in humans as well as animal models.

Public health responses have focused on identifying symptomatic individuals to halt spread. However, evidence is accruing that asymptomatic individuals are infectious and contributing to this global pandemic. Methods Observational data of 320 index cases and their 1289 positive contacts from the National COVID-19 Database in Bahrain were used to analyse symptoms, infectivity rate and PCR Ct-values. Results No significant difference (p = 1.0) in proportions of symptomatic (n = 160; 50.0%) and asymptomatic index cases (n = 160; 50.0%) were seen; however, SARS-CoV-2 positive contact cases were predominantly asymptomatic (n = 1127, 87.4%). Individuals aged 0-19 constituted a larger proportion of positive contact cases (20.8%), than index cases (4.7%; p < 0.001). 22% of the positive contacts were infected by symptomatic male index cases aged between 30-39 years. The total number of exposed contacts (p = 0.33), infected contacts (p = 0.81) and hence infectivity rate (p = 0.72) were not different between symptomatic and asymptomatic index cases. PCR Ct-values were higher in asymptomatic compared to symptomatic index cases (p < 0.001), and higher in asymptomatic compared to symptomatic positive contacts (p < 0.001). No difference between the infectivity rates of index cases with Ct-values <30 and values ≥ 30 was observed (p = 0.13). Conclusion These data reveal that the high asymptomatic incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Bahrain, and subsequent positive contacts from an index case are more likely to be asymptomatic showing the high “silent” risk of transmission and the need for comprehensive screening for each positive infection to help halt the ongoing pandemic.","Almadhi, Marwa Ali; Abdulrahman, Abdulkarim; Sharaf, Sayed Ali; AlSaad, Dana; Stevenson, Nigel J.; Atkin, Stephen L.; AlQahtani, Manaf M.",Int J Infect Dis,140,28

In this study we addressed whether inactivated HHV-6B can also induce IFN lambda responses and to what extent interferons alpha and lambda affect Th1/Th2 polarization. We show that inactivated HHV-6B induced IFN-lambda1 (IL-29) but not IFN-lambda2 (IL-28A) responses in plasmacytoid DC and that this induction was mediated through TLR9. We have previously shown that HHV-6B promotes Th1 responses and blocks Th2 responses in both humans and mice. We now show that neutralization of IFN-alpha but not IFN-lambda1 blocked the HHV-6B-induced enhancement of Th1 responses in MLR, but did not affect the HHV-6-induced dampening of Th2 responses. Similarly, blockage of TLR9 counteracted HHV-6Bs effects on the Th1/Th2 balance. In addition, IFN-alpha but not IFN-lambda1 promoted IFN-gamma production and blocked IL-5 and IL-13 production in purified CD4+ T-cells. The lack of effect of IFN-lambda1 correlated with the absence of the IFN-lambda receptor IL-28Ralfa chain on the cell surface of both resting and activated CD4+ T-cells. We conclude that inactivated HHV-6B is a strong inducer of IFN-lambda1 in plasmacytoid DC and that this induction is TLR9-dependent. However, human CD4+ T-cells do not express the IFN-lambda receptor and are refractory to IFN-lambda1 treatment. The HHV-6B-induced alterations in the Th1/Th2 balance are instead mediated mainly through TLR9 and IFN-alpha.","Nordström, Inger; Eriksson, Kristina",PLoS One,140,28

This entity was named MERS for’ Middle East respiratory syndrome’. By January 9, 2014, the disease had already struck 178 persons of whom 75 died from respiratory failure and diarrhoea. As the new disease was very similar to the deadly SARS (2002–2003) and since it was provoked by a Betacoronavirus, chiroptera were first suspected to be at the origin of this infection. Morever, recent studies performed in Saudi Arabia showed that one individual of the bat Taphozous perforatus harbored a short nucleotide segment identical to the homologous segment present in the viral strain isolated from the index-case of the epidemic. In addition, many strains of Betacoronavirus more or less related to those responsible for the MERS disease in man have been isolated from bats in Africa, Asia and Europe. However, another hypothesis was simultaneously proposed incriminating dromedary (Camelus dromedarius L.) as a likely actor in the transmission to human beings of the disease.We then reviewed data relative to other viral zoonosis in which dromedary was possibly implicated. This led to the provisional conclusion that this large mammal might play a role in the dissemination of the MERS-COV, the etiologic agent of the disease.

Its role in respiratory diseases was questioned after the detection of its DNA in clinical samples taken from patients suffering from pneumonia or bronchiolitis. To better define the role of Waddlia in both miscarriage and pneumonia, a tool allowing large-scale serological investigations of Waddlia seropositivity is needed. Therefore, enriched outer membrane proteins of W. chondrophila were used as antigens to develop a specific ELISA. After thorough analytical optimization, the ELISA was validated by comparison with micro-immunofluorescence and it showed a sensitivity above 85% with 100% specificity. The ELISA was subsequently applied to human sera to specify the role of W. chondrophila in pneumonia. Overall, 3.6% of children showed antibody reactivity against W. chondrophila but no significant difference was observed between children with and without pneumonia. Proteomic analyses were then performed using mass spectrometry, highlighting members of the outer membrane protein family as the dominant proteins. The major Waddlia putative immunogenic proteins were identified by immunoblot using positive and negative human sera. The new ELISA represents an efficient tool with high throughput applications. Although no association with pneumonia and Waddlia seropositivity was observed, this ELISA could be used to specify the role of W. chondrophila in miscarriage and in other diseases.","Lienard, J; Croxatto, A; Gervaix, A; Posfay-Barbe, K; Baud, D; Kebbi-Beghdadi, C; Greub, G",New Microbes New Infect,140,22

We find some changes in the composition of food consumption, but they are not related to shocks found in previous phone surveys conducted with the same households.

These systems can be triggered by chemical compounds but also by cytokines, toll-like receptor ligands, nucleic acids, lipids, bacteria and viruses. Despite representing unique signaling cascades, new data indicate that the UPR and NF-κB pathways converge within the nucleus through ten major transcription factors (TFs), namely activating transcription factor (ATF)4, ATF3, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (CEBP) homologous protein (CHOP), X-box-binding protein (XBP)1, ATF6α and the five NF-κB subunits. The combinatorial occupancy of numerous genomic regions (enhancers and promoters) coordinates the transcriptional activation or repression of hundreds of genes that collectively determine the balance between metabolic and inflammatory phenotypes and the extent of apoptosis and autophagy or repair of cell damage and survival. Here, we also discuss results from genetic experiments and chemical activators of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that suggest a link to the cytosolic inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB)α degradation pathway. These data show that the UPR affects this major control point of NF-κB activation through several mechanisms.

Practice facilitation is an evidence-based implementation strategy that may address barriers, harness facilitators, and optimize the implementation of alcohol-related care in liver clinic settings using a clinic-centered approach. We report the protocol of a study to test a practice facilitation intervention to implement alcohol-related care in four Veterans Health Administration liver clinics. METHODS: This study will employ a Hybrid Type 3 effectiveness-implementation design, in which implementation outcomes are considered primary and clinical outcomes secondary. Intervention and evaluation design were informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Qualitative data collected from clinical stakeholders and patients were used to tailor the intervention. The intervention involves a 6-month period of external practice facilitation, including regular meetings to identify clinic goals, challenges, and solutions; engagement of clinic champions; provision of training and development of educational materials for clinic staff and patients; and performance monitoring and feedback. Ongoing formative evaluation involves the collection of quantitative facilitator tracking data and qualitative data from meeting notes and patient interviews to describe intervention acceptability, feasibility, and adoption, and adjust implementation as needed. In the summative evaluation, implementation outcomes (clinic rates of screening, brief intervention, and treatment referral/receipt) and clinical outcomes (unhealthy alcohol use, liver health) will be assessed among patients in participating clinics using secondary electronic health record data and interrupted time series analysis. DISCUSSION: This will be the first study to our knowledge to test practice facilitation to implement alcohol-related care in liver clinic settings. Results from formative and summative evaluation will inform a framework for the successful implementation of effective alcohol-related care through practice facilitation in liver clinics, which may ultimately lead to better health outcomes for patients with chronic liver disease.","Frost, Madeline C.; Ioannou, George N.; Tsui, Judith I.; Edelman, E.

Pulmonary consolidations developed in the lungs of the patients are imperative factors during prognosis and diagnosis. Existing Deep Learning techniques demonstrate promising results in analyzing X-ray images when employed with Transfer Learning. However, Transfer Learning has its inherent limitations, which can be prevaricated by employing the Progressive Resizing technique. The Progressive Resizing technique reuses old computations while learning new ones in Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), enabling it to incorporate prior knowledge of the feature hierarchy. The proposed classification model can classify pulmonary consolidation into normal, pneumonia, and SARS-CoV-2 classes by analyzing X-rays images. The method exhibits substantial enhancement in classification results when the Transfer Learning technique is applied in consultation with the Progressive Resizing technique on EfficientNet CNN. The customized VGG-19 model attained benchmark scores in all evaluation criteria over the baseline VGG-19 model. GradCam based feature interpretation, coupled with X-ray visual analysis, facilitates improved assimilation of the scores. The model highlights its strength to assist medical experts in the COVID-19 identification during the prognosis and subsequently for diagnosis.

DESIGN: Qualitative study using semistructured telephone interviews and rapid analysis, interpreted using Baehr’s sociological lens of ‘communities of fate’. PARTICIPANTS: Forty NHS staff working in critical care, including 21 nurses, 10 doctors and advanced critical care practitioners, 4 allied health professionals, 3 operating department practitioners and 2 ward clerks. Participants were interviewed between August and October 2020; we purposefully sought the experiences of trained and experienced critical care staff and those who were redeployed. SETTING: Four hospitals in the UK. RESULTS: COVID-19 presented staff with a situation of extreme stress, duress and social emergency, leading to a shared set of experiences which we have characterised as a community of fate. This involved not only fear and dread of working in critical care, but also a collective sense of duty and vocation. Caring for patients and families involved changes to usual ways of working, revolving around: reorganisation of space and personnel, personal protective equipment, lack of evidence for treating COVID-19, inability for families to be physically present, and the trauma of witnessing extreme patient acuity and death on a large scale. The stress and isolation of working in critical care during COVID-19 was mitigated by strong teamwork, camaraderie, pride and fulfilment. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has changed working practices in critical care and profoundly affected staff physically, mentally and emotionally. Attention needs to be paid to the social and organisational conditions in which individuals work, addressing both practical resourcing and the interpersonal dynamics of critical care provision.","Montgomery, Catherine M; Humphreys, Sally; McCulloch, Corrienne; Docherty, Annemarie B; Sturdy, Steve; Pattison, Natalie",BMJ Open,140,24

They may also have specific beliefs about the impact of COVID-19-related changes on their capacity to perform, with potential consequences for self-efficacy and academic performance. Two weeks after the COVID-19-related transition to online-only learning, 89 first-year psychology students completed a measure of academic self-efficacy and indicated how they thought COVID-19-related changes would impact their capacity to perform in a psychology subject. At the end of the semester, subject grades were obtained from institutional records. Contrary to expectations, neither the self-efficacy beliefs nor the subject grades of the 2020 cohort were significantly different from those of a sample of 2019 first-year psychology students (n = 85). On average, 2020 students believed that COVID-19-related changes to their learning environment had a negative impact on their capacity to perform well. A mediation analysis indicated that students’ beliefs about the impact of COVID-19 on their capacity did not directly, or indirectly (via self-efficacy), predict grades. The only significant association in the model was between self-efficacy and grades. Although students reported believing that COVID-19-related changes would negatively impact their capacity to perform, there is little evidence that these beliefs influenced their academic self-efficacy or academic performance or that studying during the COVID-19 outbreak disadvantaged students in comparison with the previous years. A follow-up analysis indicated that self-efficacy was a stronger predictor of grades in the 2020 cohort than in the 2019 cohort. While there may be several unmeasured reasons for cohort differences, one potential interpretation is that, in the context of uncertainty associated with COVID-19, self-efficacy beliefs assumed relatively greater importance in terms of mobilising the resources required to perform well.","Talsma, Kate; Robertson, Kayleigh; Thomas, Cleo; Norris, Kimberley",Front Psychol,140,1

Through responsive enzyme-DNA nanostructures, the technology establishes a molecular circuitry that directly recognizes specific RNA targets and catalytically enhances signaling; only upon target hybridization, the molecular nanostructures activate to liberate strong enzymatic activity and initiate cascading reactions. Through automated microfluidics, the system coordinates and interfaces the molecular circuitry with embedded electronics; its pressure actuation and liquid-guiding structures improve not only analytical performance but also automated implementation. The developed platform establishes a detection limit of 7 copies of RNA target per μl, operates against the complex biological background of native patient samples, and is completed in <20 min at room temperature.

Both Trex1(−/−) mouse and TREX1-mutant human cells express high levels of antiviral genes and are refractory to viral infections. The IFN-independent activation of antiviral genes in Trex1(−/−) cells requires STING, TBK1 and IRF3 and IRF7. We also found that Trex1-deficient cells display expanded lysosomal compartment, altered subcellular localization of the transcription factor EB (TFEB), and reduced mTORC1 activity.

However, few in vitro model systems to date allow assessment of zoonotic viruses in a relevant host context. The cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) is a New World rodent species that has a long-standing history as an experimental animal model due to its unique susceptibility to human viruses. Furthermore, wild cotton rats are associated with a large variety of known or potentially zoonotic pathogens. METHODS: A method for the isolation and culture of airway epithelial cell lines recently developed for bats was applied for the generation of rodent airway and renal epithelial cell lines from the cotton rat. Continuous cell lines were characterized for their epithelial properties as well as for their interferon competence. Susceptibility to members of zoonotic Bunya-, Rhabdo-, and Flaviviridae, in particular Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), West Nile virus (WNV), and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) was tested. Furthermore, novel arthropod-derived viruses belonging to the families Bunya-, Rhabdo-, and Mesoniviridae were tested. RESULTS: We successfully established airway and kidney epithelial cell lines from the cotton rat, and characterized their epithelial properties. Cells were shown to be interferon-competent. Viral infection assays showed high-titre viral replication of RVFV, VSV, WNV, and TBEV, as well as production of infectious virus particles. No viral replication was observed for novel arthropod-derived members of the Bunya-, Rhabdo-, and Mesoniviridae families in these cell lines. CONCLUSION: In the current study, we showed that newly established cell lines from the cotton rat can serve as host-specific in vitro models for viral infection experiments. These cell lines may also serve as novel tools for virus isolation, as well as for the investigation of virus-host interactions in a relevant host species.","Ehlen, Lukas; Tödtmann, Jan; Specht, Sabine; Kallies, René; Papies, Jan; Müller, Marcel A.; Junglen, Sandra; Drosten, Christian; Eckerle, Isabella",Virol J,140,26

HRQoL is a multi-dimensional concept that reflects the degree to which a health condition interferes with participation in and fulfillment of important life areas. HRQoL is intended to capture the composite degree of physical, physiologic, psychological, and social impairment resulting from symptom burden, patient-perceived disease severity, and treatment side effects. Diminished HRQoL expectedly correlates to worsening disability and death; but interventions addressing HRQoL are linked to increased survival. Sarcoidosis, being a multi-organ system disease, is associated with a diffuse array of manifestations resulting in multiple symptoms, complications, and medication-related side effects that are linked to reduced HRQoL. Diminished HRQoL in sarcoidosis is related to decreased physical function, pain, significant loss of income, absence from work, and strain on personal relationships. Symptom distress can result clearly from a sarcoidosis manifestation (e.g., ocular pain, breathlessness, cough) but may also be non-specific, such as pain or fatigue. More complex, a single non-specific symptom, e.g., fatigue may be directly sarcoidosis-derived (e.g., inflammatory state, neurologic, hormonal, cardiopulmonary), medication-related (e.g., anemia, sleeplessness, weight gain, sub-clinical infection), or an indirect complication (e.g., sleep apnea, physical deconditioning, depression). Identifying and distinguishing underlying causes of impaired HRQoL provides opportunity for treatment strategies that can greatly impact a patient’s function, well-being, and disease outcomes. Herein, we present a reference manual that describes the current state of knowledge in sarcoidosis-related HRQoL and distinguish between diverse causes of symptom distress and other influences on sarcoidosis-related HRQoL. We provide tools to assess, investigate, and diagnose compromised HRQoL and its influencers. Strategies to address modifiable HRQoL factors through palliation of symptoms and methods to improve the sarcoidosis health profile are outlined; as well as a proposed research agenda in sarcoidosis-related HRQoL.","Saketkoo, Lesley Ann; Russell, Anne-Marie; Jensen, Kelly; Mandizha, Jessica; Tavee, Jinny; Newton, Jacqui; Rivera, Frank; Howie, Mike; Reese, Rodney; Goodman, Melanie; Hart, Patricia; Strookappe, Bert; De Vries, Jolanda; Rosenbach, Misha; Scholand, Mary Beth; Lammi, Mathew R.; Elfferich, Marjon; Lower, Elyse; Baughman, Robert P.; Sweiss, Nadera; Judson, Marc A.; Drent, Marjolein",Diagnostics (Basel),140,16

To address the critical need for evidence regarding the global burden of respiratory infections in LTCFs, we assessed the burden of respiratory infections in LTCFs through a systematic review of the published literature. METHODS: We identified articles published between April 1964 and March 2019 through searches of PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Experimental and observational studies published in English that included adults aged ≥60 residing in LTCFs who were unvaccinated (to identify the natural infection burden), and that reported measures of occurrence for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), or pneumonia were included. Disagreements about article inclusion were discussed and articles were included based on consensus. Data on study design, population, and findings were extracted from each article. Findings were synthesized qualitatively. RESULTS: A total of 1451 articles were screened for eligibility, 345 were selected for full-text review, and 26 were included. Study population mean ages ranged from 70.8 to 90.1 years. Three (12%) studies reported influenza estimates, 7 (27%) RSV, and 16 (62%) pneumonia. Eighteen (69%) studies reported incidence estimates, 7 (27%) prevalence estimates, and 1 (4%) both. Seven (27%) studies reported outbreaks. Respiratory infection incidence estimates ranged from 1.1 to 85.2% and prevalence estimates ranging from 1.4 to 55.8%. Influenza incidences ranged from 5.9 to 85.2%. RSV incidence proportions ranged from 1.1 to 13.5%. Pneumonia prevalence proportions ranged from 1.4 to 55.8% while incidence proportions ranged from 4.8 to 41.2%. CONCLUSIONS: The reported incidence and prevalence estimates of respiratory infections among older LTCF residents varied widely between published studies. The wide range of estimates offers little useful guidance for decision-making to decrease respiratory infection burden. Large, well-designed epidemiologic studies are therefore still necessary to credibly quantify the burden of respiratory infections among older adults in LTCFs, which will ultimately help inform future surveillance and intervention efforts.

We sought to identify whether states designated gun retailers as essential businesses in their stay-at-home orders and characterize other references that could affect firearm acquisition during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this cross-sectional policy review, we assessed stay-at-home orders issued in March or April 2020. Orders were reviewed in their entirety, and any reference to firearms, firearm retailers, shooting ranges, or other relevant elements was documented. Forty-three states and the District of Columbia issued stay-at-home orders. Most considered federal firearm licensees to be among essential businesses or made provisions for them to remain open during widespread business closures. Others referenced the US Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) advisory memorandum on essential critical infrastructure workers which named workers supporting firearm manufacturing and retail among essential workers. Therefore, stay-at-home orders issued in most states included provisions for firearms retailers to remain open, at least in some capacity. Only four states and the District of Columbia did not include federal firearms licensees among essential businesses or include provisions for them to be open. Meanwhile, an all-time high in firearm background checks indicates firearm sales have markedly increased. Given the associations between firearm access and injury risk, the effects of continued firearm access facilitated by these orders should be the focus of future research.","Hoops, Katherine; Johnson, Taylor; Grossman, Elyse R.; McCourt, Alex; Crifasi, Cassandra; Benjamin-Neelon, Sara E.",Prev Med,140,2

Many observational studies have reported the relationship between ADAMTS13 and some cardiovascular diseases but have drawn different conclusions, likely attributed to confounding factors lacking adjustment. Identifying the role of ADAMTS13 in cardiovascular diseases is pivotal for prevention as well as early intervention in patients with latent cardiovascular diseases. This study aims to estimate whether the level and activity of ADAMTS13 are causally associated with common cardiovascular diseases. METHODS: We applied a two-sample Mendelian randomization approach incorporating genome-wide association summary statistics to verify the causal association between ADAMTS13 level, as well as activity and cardiovascular diseases. RESULTS: Lower ADAMTS13 activity was causally associated with the increased risks for coronary heart diseases (b = −0.0041, se = 0.0019, p < 0.05) as well as myocardial infarction (b = −0.0048, se = 0.0022, p < 0.05). Standard inverse-variance weighted Mendelian randomization results suggested no genetic support for a causal association between ADAMTS13 level and cardiovascular diseases including coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and venous thromboembolism (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The causal effect of lower ADAMTS13 activity on the increased odds of having cardiovascular diseases was coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction.","Ye, Zixiang; Zheng, Jingang",Front Genet,140,16

Sporothrix schenckii is the etiological agent of human and animal sporotrichosis. Cats may act as reservoirs for S. schenckii and can transmit the infection to humans by a bite or scratch. There are few methods for the serological diagnosis of fungal diseases in animals. In this paper, an ELISA test for the diagnosis of cat sporotrichosis is proposed, which detects S. schenckii-specific antibodies in feline sera. Two different kinds of antigens were used: “SsCBF”, a specific molecule from S. schenckii that consists of a Con A-binding fraction derived from a peptido-rhamnomannan component of the cell wall, and a S. schenckii crude exoantigen preparation. The ELISA was developed, optimized, and evaluated using sera from 30 cats with proven sporotrichosis (by culture isolation); 22 sera from healthy feral cats from a zoonosis center were used as negative controls. SsCBF showed 90% sensitivity and 96% specificity in ELISA; while crude exoantigens demonstrated 96% sensitivity and 98% specificity. The ELISA assay described here would be a valuable screening tool for the detection of specific S. schenckii antibodies in cats with sporotrichosis. The assay is inexpensive, quick to perform, easy to interpret, and permits the diagnosis of feline sporotrichosis.","Fernandes, Geisa Ferreira; Lopes-Bezerra, Leila Maria; Bernardes-Engemann, Andréa Reis; Schubach, Tânia Maria Pacheco; Dias, Maria Adelaide Galvão; Pereira, Sandro Antonio; Camargo, Zoilo Pires de",Vet Microbiol,140,1

The beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil is uncertain due to the low number of tests done in the country. The excess number of deaths can suggest the beginning of the pandemic in this context. In this article, we used an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to investigate possible excesses in the number of deaths processed by the São Paulo Autopsy Service according to different causes of deaths: all-cause, cardiovascular, and pulmonary causes. We calculated the expected number of deaths using data from 2019 to 2020 (n=17,011), and investigated different seasonal patterns using harmonic dynamic regression with Fourier terms with residuals modeled by an ARIMA method. We did not find any abnormalities in the predicted number of deaths and the real values in the first months of 2020. We found an increase in the number of deaths only by March 20, 2020, right after the first COVID-19 confirmed case in the city of São Paulo, which occurred on March 16, 2020.","Gimenez, G.A.A.; Zilli, P.K.; Silva, L.F.F.; Pasqualucci, C.A.; Campo, A.B.; Suemoto, C.K.",Braz J Med Biol Res,140,16

Although interventions exist to address mental health issues following exposure to disasters, emergencies, and humanitarian crises, considerably less is known about web-based unguided interventions to help mitigate the negative impacts of such events. Additionally, in contexts in which emergencies reduce access to in-person care, remote forms of support are critical, yet there are limited studies on the use of such interventions. Evidence-based, easy-to-use, scalable interventions are direly needed for this population. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and test the feasibility of an unguided electronic mental health program, COVID-19 Anxiety and Stress Resilience Training (COAST), tailored to first responders and health care personnel, based on scientific evidence and empirically based techniques. METHODS: We developed COVID-19–specific training modules focusing on several domains that are previously reported as key to resilience and stress recovery: self-efficacy, mindfulness, sleep quality, and positive thinking. The program was made available to 702 first responders between May and August 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sociodemographic, work-, and COVID-19–related information was collected, and psychometric questionnaires were completed. We examined user acceptance and user activity, including module choice and participant feedback. RESULTS: In total, 52 of 702 (7%) first responders to whom we reached out used the program at least once. COAST use was independent of age, sex, or baseline levels of self-efficacy, mindful awareness, sleep quality, and positive thinking (for all, P>.39). First responders who had tested positive and those who had been quarantined were more likely to engage in the program. A click count analysis per module showed that participants used the self-efficacy and mindfulness modules most often, with 382 and 122 clicks, respectively, over 15 weeks. Overall, first responders expressed satisfaction with the program. CONCLUSIONS: Engagement of first responders in the multimodule web-based COAST program was feasible and the first responder cohort expressed overall satisfaction with the program. Those in more difficult circumstances, including those in quarantine and those who tested positive, may be more likely to engage in such programs. Further controlled studies could pave the way for efficacy studies and the development of additional modules, including just-in-time interventions or blended interventions combining individual use of an unguided self-help intervention, such as COAST, with subsequent individual psychotherapy for those who continue to experience stress and psychological symptoms.","Heyen, Janna Marie; Weigl, Noé; Müller, Mario; Müller, Stefan; Eberle, Urs; Manoliu, Andrei; Vetter, Stefan; Brown, Adam D; Berger, Thomas; Kleim, Birgit",JMIR Form Res,140,20

METHODS: The study was conducted at Canakkale University Hospital in Turkey. Included in the study were 82 non‐metastatic breast cancer patients whose clinical outcomes were followed‐up after primary treatment, but suspended due to the COVID‐19 outbreak. FCR, SWB and psychological resilience were assessed using the FCR inventory‐short form (FCRI‐SF), SWB scale and the brief resilience scale (BRS), respectively. RESULTS: The mean scores of breast cancer survivors concerning FCR, SWB, and psychological resilience were 17.77 ± 5.38, 36.20 ± 6.21 and 20.01 ± 4.51, respectively. A significant negative correlation was noted between the scores of FCR and SWB and psychological resilience (r = −0.329, p < 0.001 and r = −0.316, p = 0.004, respectively). Additionally, a significantly positive correlation was identified between psychological resilience and SWB (r = 0.501, p = 0.003). A hierarchical linear regression analysis with FCRI‐SF as the dependent variable, and SWB and BRS as explanatory variables, indicated that SWB affects FCRI‐SF scores and is a potential predictor of FCR. A mediation analysis revealed that SWB partially mediated the relationship between psychological resilience and FCR. CONCLUSION: Breast cancer survivors with high SWB and psychological resilience scores experience less FCR, despite their failure to maintain the medical follow‐up due to the COVID‐19 outbreak. Efforts should be made to increase the psychological resilience and SWB of patients diagnosed with breast cancer.","Koral, Lokman; Cirak, Yalcin",Psychooncology,140,1

Retrospective review of all patients needing ECMO between September 2011 and September 2020 who underwent evaluation for HIT while on ECMO. The diagnosis of HIT required a confirmatory serotonin release assay (SRA). Various break points for the optical density (OD) that defines a positive HIT ELISA were examined to estimate their utility as screening tests for HIT. Patient outcomes served as a secondary endpoint. Among 417 ECMO patients, 162 (38.8%) had a HIT ELISA. Of these, 114 (70.4%) had a subsequent SRA. Although the HIT ELISA was positive at an OD ≥ 0.4 in 1/3(rd) of subjects, only 15 subjects met criteria for HIT by SRA. Hence, the prevalence of HIT equaled 3.6%. At an OD ≥ 0.4 the ELISA had both poor specificity (71.7%) and accuracy (74.6%). Changing the definition of the ELISA to an OD ≥ 1.2 improved both specificity and accuracy with only a limited impact on sensitivity. Nearly 60% of those with HIT developing during ECMO died. HIT is infrequent in persons requiring ECMO. However, HIT remains associated with substantial mortality. The HIT ELISA as currently implemented performs poorly as a screening test and likely results in the unnecessary overuse of alternatives to unfractionated heparin. Altering the definition of a positive OD improves the HIT ELISA’s accuracy.","Zaaqoq, Akram M.; Brammer, Robert C.; Chan, Chee M.; Shorr, Andrew F.",J Thromb Thrombolysis,140,18

Here we sought to define the host immune response, a.k.a, the “cytokine storm” that has been implicated in fatal COVID-19 using an AI-based approach. METHOD: Over 45,000 transcriptomic datasets of viral pandemics were analyzed to extract a 166-gene signature using ACE2 as a ‘seed’ gene; ACE2 was rationalized because it encodes the receptor that facilitates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) into host cells. An AI-based approach was used to explore the utility of the signature in navigating the uncharted territory of Covid-19, setting therapeutic goals, and finding therapeutic solutions. FINDINGS: The 166-gene signature was surprisingly conserved across all viral pandemics, including COVID-19, and a subset of 20-genes classified disease severity, inspiring the nomenclatures ViP and severe-ViP signatures, respectively. The ViP signatures pinpointed a paradoxical phenomenon wherein lung epithelial and myeloid cells mount an IL15 cytokine storm, and epithelial and NK cell senescence and apoptosis determine severity/fatality. Precise therapeutic goals could be formulated; these goals were met in high-dose SARS-CoV-2-challenged hamsters using either neutralizing antibodies that abrogate SARS-CoV-2•ACE2 engagement or a directly acting antiviral agent, EIDD-2801. IL15/IL15RA were elevated in the lungs of patients with fatal disease, and plasma levels of the cytokine prognosticated disease severity. INTERPRETATION: The ViP signatures provide a quantitative and qualitative framework for titrating the immune response in viral pandemics and may serve as a powerful unbiased tool to rapidly assess disease severity and vet candidate drugs.

Over the past decades, several direct-acting inhibitors have been developed, including capsid binders, which block virus entry, and inhibitors of viral enzymes required for genome replication. Capsid binders and protease inhibitors have been clinically evaluated, but failed due to limited efficacy or toxicity issues. As an alternative approach, host-targeting inhibitors with potential broad-spectrum activity have been identified. Furthermore, drug repurposing screens have recently uncovered promising new inhibitors with disparate viral and host targets. Together, these findings raise hope for the development of (broad-range) anti-enteroviral drugs.","Bauer, Lisa; Lyoo, Heyrhyoung; van der Schaar, Hilde M; Strating, Jeroen RPM; van Kuppeveld, Frank JM",Current Opinion in Virology,140,16

Mortality scales can aid frontline providers in low-resource settings (LRS) in identifying those at greatest risk of death so that limited resources can be directed towards those in greatest need and unnecessary loss of life is prevented. While many prognostication tools have been developed for, or applied to, COVID-19 patients, no tools to date have been purpose-designed for, and validated in, LRS. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop a pragmatic tool to assist LRS frontline providers in evaluating in-hospital mortality risk using only easy-to-obtain demographic and clinical inputs. METHODS: Machine learning was used on data from a retrospective cohort of Sudanese COVID-19 patients at two government referral hospitals to derive contextually appropriate mortality indices for COVID-19, which were then assessed by C-indices. FINDINGS: Data from 467 patients were used to derive two versions of the AFEM COVID-19 Mortality Scale (AFEM-CMS), which evaluates in-hospital mortality risk using demographic and clinical inputs that are readily obtainable in hospital receiving areas. Both versions of the tool include age, sex, number of comorbidities, Glasgow Coma Scale, respiratory rate, and systolic blood pressure; in settings with pulse oximetry, oxygen saturation is included and in settings without access, heart rate is included. The AFEM-CMS showed good discrimination: the model including pulse oximetry had a C-statistic of 0.775 (95% CI: 0.737–0.813) and the model excluding it had a C-statistic of 0.719 (95% CI: 0.678–0.760). CONCLUSIONS: In the face of an enduring pandemic in many LRS, the AFEM-CMS serves as a practical solution to aid frontline providers in effectively allocating healthcare resources. The tool’s generalisability is likely narrow outside of similar extremely LRS settings, and further validation studies are essential prior to broader use.","Pigoga, J. L.; Omer, Y. O.; Wallis, L.

Many attempts have been devoted to modeling the dynamics of new infection rates, death rates, and the impact of the disease on health systems and the world economy. Most of these modeling concepts use the Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) and Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) compartmental models; however, wide imprecise outcomes in forecasting can occur with these models in the context of poor data, low testing levels, and a nonhomogeneous population. Objectives: To predict Brazilian ICU beds demand over time and during COVID-19 pandemic peak. Methods: In the present study, we describe a Bayesian COVID-19 model combined with a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm to forecast quantitative predictions of infections, number of deaths and the demand for critical care beds in the next month in the Brazilian context of scarce data availability. We also estimated COVID-19 spread tendency in the state of Sao Paulo and forecasted the demand for critical care beds, as Sao Paulo is the epicenter of the Latin America pandemic. Results: Our model estimated that the number of infected individuals would be approximately 6.5 million (median) on April 25, 2020, and would reach 16 to 17 million (median) by the end of August 2020 in Brazil. The probability that an infected individual requires ICU-level care in Brazil is 0.5833% . Our model suggests that the current level of mitigation seen in Sao Paulo is sufficient to reach Rt < 1, thus attaining a peak in the short term. In Sao Paulo state, the total number of deaths is estimated to be around 9,000 (median) with the 2.5% quantile being 6,600 deaths and the 97.5% quantile being around 13,350 deaths. Also, Sao Paulo will not attain its maximum capacity of ICU beds if the current trend persists over the long term. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic should peak in Brazil between May 8 and May 20, 2020 with a fatality rate lower than that suggested in the literature. The northern and northeastern regions of Brazil will suffer from a lack of available ICU beds, whereas the southeastern, southern, and central-western regions appear to have sufficient ICU beds only if they share private system beds with the publicly funded Unified Heath System (SUS). The model predicts that, if the current policies and population behavior are maintained throughout the forecasted period, by the end of August 2020, Brazil will have around 12% of its population immune to COVID-19.","Dana, S.; Simas, A.

A systematic search of five databases was conducted to identify literature published between 2010 and 2020. Nine empirical studies met the eligibility criteria and were independently assessed by two authors using the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Quality Assessment Tools and data were extracted and narratively synthesised guided by TIDieR (Template for Intervention Description and Replication) checklist. Eligible studies detailed diverse interventions facilitated by a variety of programme facilitators, with no central model of intervention or study outcome measures evident across the studies. All studies except one reported a significant change in maternal depression and anxiety scores. The interventions had limited evaluation of the woman’s, partner’s or family member’s experiences of involvement in the intervention. Further research is required to firmly establish the effectiveness of co-designed interventions to support the sustainable integration of such interventions into routine perinatal mental health services.","Noonan, Maria; Jomeen, Julie; Doody, Owen",Int J Environ Res Public Health,140,32

Further, protection and hygiene measures like fixed children/staff groups, ventilation and surface disinfection were introduced among ECEC centres. To inform or modify public health measures in ECEC, we investigate the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infections among children and staff of ECEC centres in light of social determinants (socioeconomic status of the children) and recommended structural and hygiene measures. We focus on the question if the relevant factors differ between the 2nd (when no variant of concern (VOC) circulated) and the 3rd wave (when VOC B.1.1.7 predominated). Methods: Based on panel data from a weekly online survey of ECEC centre managers (start August 2020, ongoing) including approx. 8500 centres, we esti- mate the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in children and staff using random- effect-within-between (REWB) panel models for count data in both waves. Results: In centres with a high proportion of children with low socioeconomic status (SES), the risk of infections in staff and children is more than doubled in both waves. Fixed child/staff cohorts seem more important in the 3rd wave. Contribution: ECEC centres with a large proportion of children from a low SES background and lack of using fixed child/staff cohorts experience higher COVID-19 rates. Centres should be supported in maintaining recommended measures over the long run. Preventive measures such as vaccination of staff should be prioritised in centres with large proportions of low SES children.","Neuberger, F.; Grgic, M.; Diefenbacher, S.; Spensberger, F.; Lehfeld, A.-S.; Buchholz, U.; Haas, W.; Kalicki, B.; Kuger, S.",,140,20

The evolution of the indoor aerosol concentration and particle size distribution was measured in real time with the ELPI in a room-size (24.3 m(3)) test chamber where the ion emitter was operating. After the results were compared with the natural decay, the air cleaning factor was determined. The particle aerodynamic size range of ∼0.04–2 μm was targeted because it represents many bioaerosol agents that cause emerging diseases, as well as those that can be used for biological warfare or in the event of bioterrorism. The particle electric charge distribution (also measured in the test chamber with the ELPI) was rapidly affected by the ion emission. It was concluded that the corona discharge ion emitters (either positive or negative), which are capable of creating an ion density of 10(5)–10(6) e(±) cm(−3), can be efficient in controlling fine and ultrafine aerosol pollutants in indoor air environments, such as a typical office or residential room. At a high ion emission rate, the particle mobility becomes sufficient so that the particle migration results in their deposition on the walls and other indoor surfaces. Within the tested ranges of the particle size and ion density, the particles were charged primarily due to the diffusion charging mechanism. The particle removal efficiency was not significantly affected by the particle size, while it increased with increasing ion emission rate and the time of emission. The performance characteristics of three commercially available ionic air purifiers, which produce unipolar ions by corona discharge at relatively high emission rates, were evaluated. A 30-minute operation of the most powerful device among those tested resulted in the removal of about 97% of 0.1 μm particles and about 95% of 1 μm particles from the air in addition to the natural decay effect.","Uk Lee, Byung; Yermakov, Mikhail; Grinshpun, Sergey A.",Atmos Environ (1994),140,15

The genome of coronaviruses encodes a hydrophobic transmembrane protein, the envelope (E) protein. The E protein possesses ion channel activity. Viral proteins with ion channel activity are collectively termed “viroporins”. Hexamethylene amiloride (HMA), a viroporin inhibitor, can inhibit the ion channel activity of the E protein and replication of several coronaviruses. However, it is not clear whether HMA and other viroporin inhibitors affect replication of FIPV. We examined the effect of HMA and other viroporin inhibitors (DIDS [4,4′-disothiocyano-2,2′-stilbenedisulphonic acid] and amantadine) on infection by FIPV serotypes I and II. HMA treatment drastically decreased the titers of FIPV serotype I strains Black and KU-2 in a dose-dependent manner, but it only slightly decreased the titer of FIPV serotype II strain 79-1146. In contrast, DIDS treatment decreased the titer of FIPV serotype II strain 79-1146 in dose-dependent manner, but it only slightly decreased the titers of FIPV serotype I strains Black and KU-2. We investigated whether there is a difference in ion channel activity of the E protein between viral serotypes using E. coli cells expressing the E protein of FIPV serotypes I and II. No difference was observed, suggesting that a viroporin other than the E protein influences the differences in the actions of HMA and DIDS on FIPV serotypes I and II.","Takano, Tomomi; Nakano, Kenta; Doki, Tomoyoshi; Hohdatsu, Tsutomu",Arch Virol,140,1

Evidence suggests that there is variation in how States have implemented this guidance. This review examines how the position of population groups in vaccine priority lists varies between Federal guidance and State practice. Methods: An online search of State vaccination prioritization plans was conducted. Data were extracted on each population group included and their relative position. A standardized ranking method was applied to provide a directional measure of variability in prioritization between State and Federal guidance, for each population group. Results: Healthcare workers and those in long-term care facilities were largely prioritized in line with Federal guidance. Aside from early education staff, essential workers were often excluded at State level. Of the 37 States including frontline essential workers, 12 assigned them to a lower priority than recommended. Almost all States included the 65-74 year age group and most assigned them to a higher position than recommended in Federal guidance. Those with underlying medical conditions were similarly highly prioritized, although there was more variability across States. Some socially vulnerable groups (not included in Federal guidance) were highly prioritized by States. Conclusions: Across the U.S, the prioritization of groups for COVID-19 vaccination has been highly variable. Essential workers were the most often excluded or less highly prioritised group compared to Federal guidance. Some socially vulnerable groups were highly prioritized in State plans, whilst others were mentioned in only a few States. Future guidance must be relevant to local needs and values, to minimise any unwarranted heterogeneity in vaccine access across populations.","Jain, V.; Schwarz, L.; Lorgelly, P.",,140,16

We examined whether the in-hospital mortality of patients in Taiwan treated with IABP has recently declined. We used Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database to retrospectively review the in-hospital all-cause mortality of 9952 (7146 men [71.8%]) 18-year-old and older patients treated with IABP between 1998 and 2008. The mortality rate was 13.84% (n = 1377). The urbanization levels of the hospitals, and the number of days in the intensive care unit, of hospitalization, and of IABP treatment, and prior percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were associated with mortality. Seven thousand six hundred thirty-five patients (76.72%) underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, and 576 (5.79%) underwent high-risk PCI with IABP treatment. The number of patients treated with IABP significantly increased during this decade (p(trend) < 0.0001), the in-hospital all-cause mortality for patients treated with IABP significantly decreased (p(trend) = 0.0243), but the in-hospital all-cause mortality of patients who underwent CABG and PCI plus IABP did not decrease. In conclusion, the in-hospital mortality rate of IABP treatment decreased annually in Taiwan during the study period. However, high-risk patients who underwent coronary revascularization with IABP had a higher and unstable in-hospital mortality rate.","Ho, Chung-Han; Chen, Zhih-Cherng; Chu, Chin-Chen; Wang, Jhi-Joung; Chiang, Chun-Yen",PLoS One,140,1

To date, up to 29 serotypes of BTV have been described, which are classified as classical (BTV 1–24) or atypical (serotypes 25–27), and its distribution has been expanding since 1998, with important outbreaks in the Mediterranean Basin and devastating incursions in Northern and Western Europe. Classical vaccine approaches, such as live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines, have been used as prophylactic measures to control BT through the years. However, these vaccine approaches fail to address important matters like vaccine safety profile, effectiveness, induction of a cross-protective immune response among serotypes, and implementation of a DIVA (differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals) strategy. In this context, a wide range of recombinant vaccine prototypes against BTV, ranging from subunit vaccines to recombinant viral vector vaccines, have been investigated.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis on 116 patients. RESULTS: Three factors were observed to be independently associated with progression to severe COVID-19 during 14 days after admission: (a) age 65 years or older (hazard ratio [HR] = 8.456; 95% CI: 2.706–26.426); (b) creatine kinase (CK) ≥ 180 U/L (HR = 3.667; 95% CI: 1.253–10.733); and (c) CD4+ T-cell counts <300 cells/µL (HR = 4.695; 95% CI: 1.483–14.856). The difference in rates of severe COVID-19 development was found to be statistically significant between patients aged 65 years or older (46.2%) and those younger than 65 years (90.2%), between patients with CK ≥ 180 U/L (55.6%) and those with CK < 180 U/L (91.5%), and between patients with CD4+ T-cell counts <300 cells/µL (53.8%) and those with CD4+ cell counts ≥300 cells/µL (83.2%).

However, by reducing the risk of being infected by others, more self-protection may lead each individual to go outside the house more often. In the absence of lockdown, this creates a “collective offsetting effect”, since more people outside means that the risk of infection is increased for all. However, wearing masks also creates a positive externality on others, by reducing the risk of infecting them. We show how to integrate these different effects in a simple model, and we discuss when self-protection efforts should be encouraged (or deterred) by a social planner.","Salanié, François; Treich, Nicolas",Geneva Risk Insur Rev,140,30

The PRE-COVID-19 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-2 were applied. Reliability analysis was performed for internal consistency, structural equation modeling and item response theory modeling. RESULTS: The results show that a unidimensional 5-item model presents satisfactory goodness-of-fit indices and excellent reliability values. Likewise, convergent validity between the PRE-COVID-19 and a measure of anxiety is evident. All items present adequate discrimination parameters, allowing for discerning between those patients with critical concern about COVID-19 contagion from those with severe concern.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to actively finding effective treatment drugs and developing vaccines, it is more important to identify the source of infection at the community level as soon as possible to block the transmission path of the virus to prevent the spread of the pandemic. The implementation of grid management in the community and the adoption of precise management and control measures to reduce unnecessary personnel movement can effectively reduce the risk of pandemic spread. This paper mainly describes that the grid management mode can promote the refinement and comprehensiveness of community management.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize socioeconomic and chronic disease-related mechanisms underlying these differences. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: Outpatient and emergency care. PATIENTS: 12900 Cleveland Clinic Health System patients referred for SARS-CoV-2 testing between March 17 and April 15, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Nasopharyngeal PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 infection. MEASUREMENTS: Test location (emergency department, ED, vs. outpatient care), COVID-19 symptoms, test positivity and hospitalization among positive cases. RESULTS: We identified six classes of symptoms, ranging in test positivity from 3.4% to 23%. Non-Hispanic Black race/ethnicity was disproportionately represented in the group with highest positivity rates. Non-Hispanic Black patients ranged from 1.81 [95% confidence interval: 0.91–3.59] times (at age 20) to 2.37 [1.54–3.65] times (at age 80) more likely to test positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus than non-Hispanic White patients, while test positivity was not significantly different across the neighborhood income spectrum.

The main motive of this proposal is to reduce the human resources, improve waste disposal, and make the waste reusable. In a hospital environment there is different color code that decides which equipment should be disposed of. The doctors and the nurse are the people who decide what color code is to be used for the disposal of medical equipment. The different color-coded waste bin is chosen for making reusable waste into a fertilizer for agricultural fields. To do this process the system is designed in an efficient method and cost reduction is maintained until the end of the process. Before entering the recycling process all the waste should be sanitized. After the verification process is done on the waste materials the recycling process gets started on the basis of the color code of the waste collection. A smart bin will be designed for each color code based on the usage of the medical equipment; the segregation process will be carried out in each phase. In the final phase after the recycling process it will be used as fertilizer and will be distributed to the farmers to improve crop yield. An algorithm is going to work on data verification and checking process, which will be done automatically. After the data automation process a intimation will be sent to the final testing process where it helps us to do segregation process in an efficient way.","Kumar, R.

COVID-19 outbreak,12.159136,9.497448,2021-02-10,"Introduction Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has led to an unprecedented global pandemic. Given highly variable clinical presentations, readily obtainable predictive biomarkers are urgently needed to identify patients are risk of severe disease and death. Anemia is commonly present in hospitalized patients yet its prognostic potential in COVID-19 remains largely unexplored. Methods We evaluated all adult patients at a large tertiary health system during the month of March 2020 who were diagnosed with COVID-19, excluding patients without a complete blood count (CBC) obtained at the time of diagnosis. Anemia was defined by as a hemoglobin (hgb) <13 g/dL for males and <12 g/dL for females. Chi-squared and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were performed to assess difference in anemia, demographics, and other laboratory values according to mortality. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess independent predictors of outcomes including mechanical ventilation and death. An adaption of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was conducted to identify optimal cut points of hemoglobin levels that best predict mechanical ventilation and mortality. Results During the study period, 3,777 adults with COVID-19 were identified, of which 2,439 had a CBC. 861 patients (35.4%) met criteria for anemia, as shown in the Table, and they were significantly older and had a higher comorbidity burden. Mechanical ventilation was required in 531 patients (14.1%) and 629 patients (17%) were deceased. On multivariable logistic regression adjusting for age, sex, race, and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), anemia was significantly associated with higher risk of mortality (adjusted OR [ORadj]: 1.45, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.17-1.80) and need for mechanical ventilation (ORadj: 2.03, 95% CI: 1.64-2.51). For mortality, the optimal cutoff of hgb by ROC curve was 12.5 g/dL in males and 12.1 g/dL in females. These hgb cutoff for mechanical ventilation were 13.5 g/dL for male and 11.0 g/dL for females. When applying these cutoffs to the definition of anemia, a stronger association was observed between anemia and mortality (ORadj 1.68, 95% CI: 1.22-1.93) and need for mechanical ventilation (ORadj 2.09, 95% CI: 1.68-2.61). We also performed a subgroup analysis of patients with a normal hemoglobin to assess the independent predictive value of red blood cell distribution width (RDW). Of the 1578 patients without anemia, 139 (8.8%) had an elevated RDW (>15%). On multivariable logistic regression adjusting for age, sex, race, and CCI, an elevated RDW was statistically associated with need for mechanical ventilation (ORadj: 1.74, CI: 1.12-2.69) and mortality (ORadj: 1.93, CI: 1.26-2.95). Conclusions In this single health system study, anemia was significantly associated with both need for mechanical ventilation and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Based on ROC analysis, the ideal cutoff for considering anemias a significant contributor to these outcomes was just below normal, suggesting that even mild anemia in the context of COVID-19 is an independent predictor of mortality and need for intubation. In addition, an elevated RDW in non-anemic patients was also independently predictive of mortality. Our analysis is limited by inability to determine the chronicity of baseline anemia. Given that a CBC is almost universally obtained on patients with COVID-19, this study identifies a readily accessible predictive biomarker to inform risk adaptive clinical care. The mechanisms by which anemia impacts outcomes in COVID-19 are likely to be multiple in nature and require further investigation.

Baseline characteristics, health care resource utilization, and mortality rates were compared between those hospitalized with COVID-19 and those hospitalized with other causes. Predictors of in-hospital mortality were identified in HF patients hospitalized with COVID-19 by using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 1,212,153 patients with history of HF, 132,312 patients were hospitalized from April 1, 2020, to September 30, 2020. A total of 23,843 patients (18.0%) were hospitalized with acute HF, 8,383 patients (6.4%) were hospitalized with COVID-19, and 100,068 patients (75.6%) were hospitalized with alternative reasons. Hospitalization with COVID-19 was associated with greater odds of in-hospital mortality as compared with hospitalization with acute HF; 24.2% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 died in-hospital compared to 2.6% of those hospitalized with acute HF. This association was strongest in April (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 14.48; 95% confidence interval [CI]:12.25 to 17.12) than in subsequent months (adjusted OR: 10.11; 95% CI: 8.95 to 11.42; p(interaction) <0.001). Among patients with HF hospitalized with COVID-19, male sex (adjusted OR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.13 to 1.40) and morbid obesity (adjusted OR: 1.25; 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.46) were associated with greater odds of in-hospital mortality, along with age (adjusted OR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.29 to 1.42 per 10 years) and admission earlier in the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HF hospitalized with COVID-19 are at high risk for complications, with nearly 1 in 4 dying during hospitalization.","Bhatt, Ankeet S.; Jering, Karola S.; Vaduganathan, Muthiah; Claggett, Brian L.; Cunningham, Jonathan W.; Rosenthal, Ning; Signorovitch, James; Thune, Jens J.; Vardeny, Orly; Solomon, Scott D.",JACC Heart Fail,140,12

Lockdown and social distancing were mandated worldwide, resulting in closure of medical services. The diagnosis of various kidney diseases may have been delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic because non-urgent tests and visits were postponed due to closure of medical services during the lockdown. Based on previous reports, this afftects especially kidney diseases requiring renal biopsy and histological analysis for diagnosis. We have previously reported that during the lockdown period in March and April 2020, an incidence-shift with a COVID-19 gap of no diagnosed antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) and ANCA glomerulonephritis (GN) based on renal biopsy was followed by a postlockdown phase in subsequent months with a compensatory increased incidence rate. This has been attributed to a decreased number of renal biopsies during the lockdown period and a compensatory increased number in the postlockdown phase. We here expanded our analysis to evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on kidney diseases requiring renal biopsy. Furthermore, we aimed to identify effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical outcomes in patients with kidney diseases, including ANCA GN. With multiple vaccines currently undergoing human trials to combat this pandemic, there is an urgent need for a clear sense for patient populations most susceptible to shutdown of medical services. We here report the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on native kidney diseases requiring renal biopsy for diagnosis in a retrospective observational study from a tertiary hospital in Germany. METHOD: A total number of 209 renal biopsies performed on native kidneys of patients hospitalized at the University Medical Center Göttingen in 2019 and 2020 were included. Variables were tested for normal distribution using Shapiro-Wilk test. Non-normally distributed continuous variables are expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR), categorical variables are presented as frequencies and percentages. Statistical comparisons were not formally powered or prespecified. For group comparisons, the Mann-Whitney U-test was used to determine differences in medians. Non-parametric between-group-comparisons were performed with Pearson’s Chi-square test. Data analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism (version 8.4.0 for MacOS, GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, USA). RESULTS: The lockdown period in March and April 2020 primarily affected patients admitted to the normal medical ward with a compensatory increased rate of renal biopsies in the postlockdown phase. In addition, there was a shift towards more patients admitted with hemoglobinuria during the COVID-19 pandemic. This phenomenon of an increased number of patients with hemoglobinuria during the COVID-19 pandemic was specifically observed in a subgroup with ANCA GN and hypertensive nephropathy requiring renal biopsy. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report of identifying a subpopulation susceptible to closure of medical services during the COVID-19 pandemic and diagnostic delay of specific kidney diseases. Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic should be regarded as a risk factor especially in patients with diseases other than COVID-19 primarily admitted to the normal medical ward.","Tampe, Björn; Hakroush, Samy",Nephrol Dial Transplant,140,1

For the purpose of instant detecting of FMD and differentiating it from the other vesicular diseases, a Luminex assay was developed. Sera from 64 infected, 307 vaccinated, and 280 naïve pigs were tested by the Luminex assay. Diagnostic sensitivity of the assay was 100%. Diagnostic specificity of the assay was 98.7% in vaccinated pigs and 97.5% to 100% in naïve pigs. Agreement between the results from the Luminex assay and those from a 3ABC polypeptide blocking ELISA was 96.3% with kappa statistics of 0.92. The Luminex assay can detect the immune response to NSP-3ABC in swine as early as eight days post-infection. Moreover, all of the 15 vaccinated but unprotected pigs were all detected by the Luminex assay. The results indicated that the Luminex assay has potential with specificity in detecting antibodies to FMDV 3ABC NSP and in distinguishing FMDV-infected pigs from with either SVDV or VSV.","Chen, Tsu-Han; Lee, Fan; Lin, Yeou-Liang; Pan, Chu-Hsiang; Shih, Chia-Ni; Lee, Ming-Chang; Tsai, Hsiang-Jung",J Immunol Methods,140,17

PBI and accelerated PBI (APBI) can be delivered with external beam radiation (3D conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) or intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)), intraoperative radiation (IORT), or brachytherapy. These new radiation techniques offer the advantage of convenience and lower cost, which ultimately improves access to care. Globally, the COVID 19 pandemic has accelerated APBI/PBI and ultra-hypofractionated regimens into routine practice for carefully selected patients. Recent long-term data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated these techniques are safe and effective in suitable patients demonstrating equivalent or improved local recurrence, acute/late toxicity, and cosmesis. PBI and APBI should be limited to low risk unifocal invasive ductal carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ with tumor size < 2 cm, clear margins (&#8805;2 mm), ER+, and negative nodes.

It was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia and has now spread to eight countries. Development of effective therapeutics and vaccines is crucial to save lives and halt the spread of MERS-CoV. Here, we show that a recombinant protein containing a 212-amino acid fragment (residues 377-588) in the truncated receptor-binding domain (RBD: residues 367–606) of MERS-CoV spike (S) protein fused with human IgG Fc fragment (S377-588-Fc) is highly expressed in the culture supernatant of transfected 293T cells. The purified S377-588-Fc protein efficiently binds to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor of MERS-CoV, and potently inhibited MERS-CoV infection, suggesting its potential to be further developed as a therapeutic modality for treating MERS-CoV infection and saving the patients’ lives. The recombinant S377-588-Fc is able to induce in the vaccinated mice strong MERS-CoV S-specific antibodies, which blocks the binding of RBD to DPP4 receptor and effectively neutralizes MERS-CoV infection. These findings indicate that this truncated RBD protein shows promise for further development as an effective and safe vaccine for the prevention of MERS-CoV infection.","Du, Lanying; Kou, Zhihua; Ma, Cuiqing; Tao, Xinrong; Wang, Lili; Zhao, Guangyu; Chen, Yaoqing; Yu, Fei; Tseng, Chien-Te K.; Zhou, Yusen; Jiang, Shibo",PLoS One,140,16

Seeking for the input data homogeneity, we analyze single-stranded RNA viruses only. Two approaches are used to obtain the nucleotide sequences; In the first one, chunks of equal length (four nucleotides) are considered. In the second approach, the whole RNA genome is divided into parts by adenine or the most frequent nucleotide as a “space”. Rank–frequency distributions are studied in both cases. The defined nucleotide sequences are signs comparable to a certain extent to syllables or words as seen from the nature of their rank–frequency distributions. Within the first approach, the Pólya and the negative hypergeometric distribution yield the best fit. For the distributions obtained within the second approach, we have calculated a set of parameters, including entropy, mean sequence length, and its dispersion. The calculated parameters became the basis for the classification of viruses. We observed that proximity of viruses on planes spanned on various pairs of parameters corresponds to related species. In certain cases, such a proximity is observed for unrelated species as well calling thus for the expansion of the set of parameters used in the classification. We also observed that the fifth most frequent nucleotide sequences obtained within the second approach are of different nature in case of human coronaviruses (different nucleotides for MERS, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 versus identical nucleotides for four other coronaviruses). We expect that our findings will be useful as a supplementary tool in the classification of diseases caused by RNA viruses with respect to severity and contagiousness.","Husev, Mykola; Rovenchak, Andrij",Biosemiotics,140,23

Dietary deficiencies of micronutrients can weaken adaptive immunity. The aim of this review was to examine links between micronutrients, immune function and COVID-19 infection, with a focus on nutritional risks in subgroups of the Swiss population. Methods Scoping review on the associations between selected micronutrients (vitamins D and C, iron, selenium, zinc, and n-3 PUFAs) and immunity, with particular reference to the Swiss population. These nutrients were chosen because previous EFSA reviews have concluded they play a key role in immunity. Results The review discusses the available knowledge on links between sufficient nutrient status, optimal immune function, and prevention of respiratory tract infections. Because of the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, controlled intervention studies of micronutrients in the context of CIOVIUD-19 infection are now underway, but evidence is not yet available to draw conclusions. The anti-inflammatory properties of n-3 PUFAs are well established. In Switzerland, several subgroups of the population are at clear risk of nutrient deficiencies; e.g., older adults, multiple comorbidities, obesity, pregnancy, and institutionalized. Low intakes of n-3 PUFA are present in a large proportion of the population. Conclusion There are clear and strong relationships between micronutrient and n-3 PUFA status and immune function, and subgroups of the Swiss population are at risk for deficient intakes. Therefore, during the COVID-19 pandemic, as a complement to a healthy and balanced diet, it may be prudent to consider supplementation with moderate doses of Vitamins C and D, as well as of Se, Zn and n-3 PUFA, in risk groups.","Berger, Mette M.; Herter-Aeberli, Isabelle; Zimmermann, Michael B.; Spieldenner, Jörg; Eggersdorfer, Manfred",Clin Nutr ESPEN,140,1

In addition, due to the overuse of antibiotics, many multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens have been widely encountered in clinical settings. Thus, the fast identification of bacteria pathogens and profiling of antibiotic resistance could greatly facilitate the precise treatment strategy of infectious diseases. So far, many conventional and molecular methods, both manual or automatized, have been developed for in vitro diagnostics, which have been proven to be accurate, reliable, and time efficient. Although Raman spectroscopy (RS) is an established technique in various fields such as geochemistry and material science, it is still considered as an emerging tool in research and diagnosis of infectious diseases. Based on current studies, it is too early to claim that RS may provide practical guidelines for microbiologists and clinicians because there is still a gap between basic research and clinical implementation. However, due to the promising prospects of label-free detection and noninvasive identification of bacterial infections and antibiotic resistance in several single steps, it is necessary to have an overview of the technique in terms of its strong points and shortcomings. Thus, in this review, we went through recent studies of RS in the field of infectious diseases, highlighting the application potentials of the technique and also current challenges that prevent its real-world applications.","Wang, Liang; Liu, Wei; Tang, Jia-Wei; Wang, Jun-Jiao; Liu, Qing-Hua; Wen, Peng-Bo; Wang, Meng-Meng; Pan, Ya-Cheng; Gu, Bing; Zhang, Xiao",Front Microbiol,140,24

African countries see slower dynamic of COVID-19 cases and deaths. One of the assumptions that may explain this later emergence in Africa, and more particularly in malaria endemic areas, would be the use of antimalarial drugs. We investigated the in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 of several antimalarial drugs. Chloroquine (EC(50) = 2.1 μM and EC(90) = 3.8 μM), hydroxychloroquine (EC(50) = 1.5 μM and EC(90) = 3.0 μM), ferroquine (EC(50) = 1.5 μM and EC(90) = 2.4 μM), desethylamodiaquine (EC(50) = 0.52 μM and EC(90) = 1.9 μM), mefloquine (EC(50) = 1.8 μM and EC(90) = 8.1 μM), pyronaridine (EC(50) = 0.72 μM and EC(90) = 0.75 μM) and quinine (EC(50) = 10.7 μM and EC(90) = 38.8 μM) showed in vitro antiviral effective activity with IC(50) and IC(90) compatible with drug oral uptake at doses commonly administered in malaria treatment. The ratio C(lung)/EC(90) ranged from 5 to 59. Lumefantrine, piperaquine and dihydroartemisinin had IC(50) and IC(90) too high to be compatible with expected plasma concentrations (ratio C(max)/EC(90) < 0.05). Based on our results, we would expect that countries which commonly use artesunate-amodiaquine or artesunate-mefloquine report fewer cases and deaths than those using artemether-lumefantrine or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. It could be necessary now to compare the antimalarial use and the dynamics of COVID-19 country by country to confirm this hypothesis.","Gendrot, Mathieu; Andreani, Julien; Boxberger, Manon; Jardot, Priscilla; Fonta, Isabelle; Le Bideau, Marion; Duflot, Isabelle; Mosnier, Joel; Rolland, Clara; Bogreau, Hervé; Hutter, Sébastien; La Scola, Bernard; Pradines, Bruno",Travel Med Infect Dis,140,16

Older patients, and those with respiratory or cardiovascular conditions, appear to be at greater risk for severe complications. We aim to describe baseline characteristics and mortality in patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at our institution. METHOD(S): Retrospective medical records review of patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 between January 1, 2020 and May 8, 2019 at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston MA. Patients were identified from our institutional database (Clinical Query 2). Demographics, baseline comorbidities, medications at admission and initial laboratories results were collected. Clinical outcomes such as mortality, ICU admission and mechanical ventilation were also recorded. RESULT(S): A total of 449 subjects were included (Age 57 years [IQR 41-69];BMI 30.2 kg/m [IQR 25.9-35.3];44.5% males). One hundred-fifteen patients (25.6%) required hospital admission with a median hospital stay of 6 days (IQR 3-12). From those, 28 patients (24.35 %) required ICU management with a median stay of 9 days (4-15.5). Seventeen subjects (14.78%) required mechanical ventilation with a mean time for of 10.65 days (SD 7.84). From the intubated patients, 2 (11.74%) ended up with tracheostomy. Twenty-nine (6.46%) of the total died due to SARS-CoV-2 complications. Elderly (82 vs 55 years, p=<0.001), smokers (37.9% vs 14.8%, p=0.003), congestive heart failure (31% vs 11%, p=0.004), dementia (24.1% vs 4%, p=<0.001), diabetes mellitus (44.8% vs 26.2%, p=0.05), chronic kidney disease (62.1% vs 13.6%, p=<0.001) and cancer patients (20.7% vs 7.9%, p=0.042) died more frequently due to SARS-CoV-2 related complications. Mortality for patients requiring ICU admission was 37.9% compared 4% (p=<0.001). For patient requiring mechanical ventilation, mortality was 24.1% compared to 2.4% (p=<0.001). CONCLUSION(S): Our review showed that elderly, presence of comorbidities, ICU admission and patient requiring mechanical ventilation died more frequently due to SARS-CoV-2 related complications.

Cost-effectiveness analysis is required to assist decision-makers evaluating alternative healthcare worker (HCW) mask/respirator strategies. This study aims to compare the cost-effectiveness of N95 respirators and medical masks for protecting HCWs in Beijing, China. METHODS: We developed a cost-effectiveness analysis model utilising efficacy and resource use data from two cluster randomised clinical trials assessing various mask/respirator strategies conducted in HCWs in Level 2 and 3 Beijing hospitals for the 2008–09 and 2009–10 influenza seasons. The main outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per clinical respiratory illness (CRI) case prevented. We used a societal perspective which included intervention costs, the healthcare costs of CRI in HCWs and absenteeism costs. RESULTS: The incremental cost to prevent a CRI case with continuous use of N95 respirators when compared to medical masks ranged from US $490–$1230 (approx. 3000-7600 RMB). One-way sensitivity analysis indicated that the CRI attack rate and intervention effectiveness had the greatest impact on cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The determination of cost-effectiveness for mask/respirator strategies will depend on the willingness to pay to prevent a CRI case in a HCW, which will vary between countries. In the case of a highly pathogenic pandemic, respirator use in HCWs would likely be a cost-effective intervention.","Mukerji, Shohini; MacIntyre, C.

Even though the majority of patients remain completely asymptomatic, some develop severe systemic complications. In this prospective study we compared the immunological profile of 101 COVID-19 patients with either mild, moderate or severe form of the disease according to the WHO classification, as well as of 50 healthy subjects, in order to identify functional immune factors independently associated with severe forms of COVID-19. Plasma cytokine levels, and cytokine levels upon in vitro non-specific stimulation of innate and adaptive immune cells, were measured at several time points during the course of the disease. As described previously, inflammatory cytokines IL1β, IL6, IL8, and TNFα associated with cytokine storm were significantly increased in the plasma of moderate and severe COVID-19 patients (p < 0.0001 for all cytokines). During follow-up, plasma IL6 levels decreased between the moment of admission to the hospital and at the last observation carried forward for patients with favorable outcome (p = 0.02148). After in vitro stimulation of immune cells from COVID-19 patients, reduced levels of both type I and type II interferons (IFNs) upon in vitro stimulation were correlated with increased disease severity [type I IFN (IFNα): p > 0.0001 mild vs. moderate and severe; type II IFN (IFNγ): p = 0.0002 mild vs. moderate and p < 0.0001 mild vs. severe] suggesting a functional exhaustion of IFNs production. Stimulated IFNα levels lower than 2.1 pg/ml and IFNγ levels lower than 15 IU/mL at admission to the hospital were associated with more complications during hospitalization (p = 0.0098 and p =0.0002, respectively). A low IFNγ level was also confirmed by multivariable analysis [p = 0.0349 OR = 0.98 (0.962; 0.999)] as an independent factor of complications. In vitro treatment with type IFNα restored type IFNγ secretion in COVID-19 patients while the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL6 and IL1β remained stable or decreased, respectively. These results (a) demonstrate a functional exhaustion of both innate and adaptive immune response in severe forms of COVID-19; (b) identify IFNα and IFNγ as new potential biomarkers of severity; and (c) highlight the importance of targeting IFNs when considering COVID-19 treatment in order to re-establish a normal balance between inflammatory and Th1 effector cytokines.","Ruetsch, Caroline; Brglez, Vesna; Crémoni, Marion; Zorzi, Kévin; Fernandez, Céline; Boyer-Suavet, Sonia; Benzaken, Sylvia; Demonchy, Elisa; Risso, Karine; Courjon, Johan; Cua, Eric; Ichai, Carole; Dellamonica, Jean; Passeron, Thierry; Seitz-Polski, Barbara",Front Med (Lausanne),140,12

Emerging evidence has shown that incidence rate, hospitalisation rate, and mortality due to COVID‐19 are higher among people in lower socio‐economic position (SEP). In addition, first investigations indicate that not everyone is equally affected by this pandemic's collateral public health damage. Using a stratified random sample of 1,004 participants living in Vienna, a Central European city with approximately 1.9 million inhabitants, this study analysed the distribution of 10 adverse health‐related and socio‐economic outcomes attributable to the COVID‐19 pandemic across socio‐economic strata. To this end, we estimated differences in the incidence rate of these outcomes by SEP and each of its indicators using zero‐inflated Poisson and logistic regression models, adjusted for age and gender. Data were collected during first lockdown measures between 27 April and 17 May 2020. Differences in the incidence rate between the two lowest and two highest SEP groups were clearly visible. Participants in the lowest SEP category had a 32.96% higher incidence rate (IRR = 1.333 [95% CI: 1.079–1.639]), and participants in the second lowest SEP category had a 44.69% higher incidence rate (IRR = 1.447 [95% CI: 1.190–1.760]) compared with participants in the highest SEP category. In sum, 6 out of 10 adverse COVID‐19‐related outcomes were, to a greater or lesser extent, disproportionately experienced by Viennese residents in lower SEP. Inequalities were most visible between income groups and for the outcomes job loss, worsening of the financial situation, and worse mental health. These results strengthen and extend the current evidence on the unequally distributed burden of the COVID‐19 pandemic. In light of effect heterogeneity across SEP indicators, we encourage future investigators to pay increased attention to their operationalisation of SEP. Such awareness will help to correctly identify those in most urgent need of supportive polices.","Oberndorfer, Moritz; Dorner, Thomas E.; Brunnmayr, Martina; Berger, Katharina; Dugandzic, Belma; Bach, Michael",Health Soc Care Community,140,3

ALV infection has become endemic in China and has a significant negative effect on the poultry industry. Consequently, there is an urgent need for a specific, sensitive and rapid method for diagnosis and eradication of ALV. Therefore, we developed a simple and rapid real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reaction for the timely detection of the common ALV subgroups, whereby the amplification can be obtained in 35 min under isothermal conditions at 63 °C, ability to specific, sensitive and rapid detect all the common ALV subgroups. METHODS: A set of four specific primers was designed to target the sequences of the pol gene of ALV, and the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay were developed and compared with PCR and virus isolation methods. RESULTS: The results from specificity of the LAMP assay showed that only target ALVs DNA was amplified. The LAMP assay demonstrated a sensitivity of 20 copies/reaction of ALV DNA, which was 10 times higher than the conventional PCR measurement. To further evaluate the reliability of the method, the assay was evaluated with ALV DNA from a panel of 81 clinical samples suspected of ALV infection. The results verify that the LAMP method was more sensitive than the conventional PCR and virus isolation method. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the developed LAMP assay was a simple, inexpensive, sensitive method for the rapid detection of the most common subgroups of ALV, and it provided a useful and practical tool in the eradication program for ALV in the poultry industry.","Peng, Hao; Qin, Lili; Bi, Yuyu; Wang, Peikun; Zou, Guangzhen; Li, Jun; Yang, Yongli; Zhong, Xingfu; Wei, Ping",Virol J,140,5

We aim at investigating the sociodemographic and environmental determinants of wellbeing during global lockdown due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: A nationwide survey was sent online to the French population during the second week of global lockdown during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, between March 25, 2020 and March 30, 2020. Volunteers were recruited on social networks, online newspapers, and mailing lists. We analyzed sociodemographic and environmental variables obtained from a co-built and evidence-based questionnaire. Mental wellbeing was measured by the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS). Results: We analyzed data from 11,391 (56.6%) out of 20,235 participants who answered the questionnaire. After weighting data on age and gender distributions, 5415 of the respondents were male (47.5%), 5932 were female (52.1%), and 52 (0.5%) registered as other. Multivariate analyses indicated that various factors impacted mental wellbeing. Being female (p < .001), a student (p < .001), disabled (p = .001), or having no access to outdoor space (p = 0.02) was associated with lower WEMWBS scores. Conversely, being employed (p < .001) and having more social contacts (p < .01) were both associated with greater mental wellbeing. Interpretation: We revealed differences in mental wellbeing among the French population at the early stages of global lockdown. Authorities should consider the particular vulnerability of students, persons with disabilities, and those living in constrained housing conditions that could increase the negative impact of lockdown on mental health.","HAESEBAERT, F.; Haesebaert, J.; Zante, E.; Franck, N.",,140,18

However, COVID-19 is increasingly recognized to cause an overwhelming inflammatory response and cytokine storm leading to end organ damage. End organ damage to heart is one of the most severe complications of COVID-19 that increases the risk of death. We proposed a two-fold mechanism responsible for causing acute coronary events in patients with COVID-19 infection: Cytokine storm leading to rapid onset formation of new coronary plaques along with destabilization of pre-existing plaques and direct myocardial injury secondary to acute systemic viral infection. A well-coordinated immune response is the first line innate immunity against a viral infection. However, an uncoordinated response and hypersecretion of cytokines and chemokines lead to immune related damage to the human body. Human Coronavirus (HCoV) infection causes infiltration of inflammatory cells that cause excessive production of cytokines, proteases, coagulation factors, oxygen radicals and vasoactive molecules causing endothelial damage, disruption of fibrous cap and initiation of formation of thrombus. Systemic viral infections also cause vasoconstriction leading to narrowing of vascular lumen and stimulation of platelet activation via shear stress. The resultant cytokine storm causes secretion of hypercoagulable tissue factor without consequential increase in counter-regulatory pathways such as AT-III, activated protein C and plasminogen activator type 1. Lastly, influx of CD4+ T-cells in cardiac vasculature results in an increased production of cytokines that stimulate smooth muscle cells to migrate into the intima and generate collagen and other fibrous products leading to advancement of fatty streaks to advanced atherosclerotic lesions. Direct myocardial damage and cytokine storm leading to destabilization of pre-existing plaques and accelerated formation of new plaques are the two instigating mechanisms for acute coronary syndromes in COVID-19.","Sheth, Aakash R; Grewal, Udhayvir S; Patel, Harsh P; Thakkar, Samarthkumar; Garikipati, Subhash; Gaddam, Jashwanth; Bawa, Danish",Med Hypotheses,140,20

The diagnosis of active infection of the lower respiratory tract is challenging on daily basis in the absence of accurate clinical signs. Clinical scoring systems such as the Californian scoring system, are appealing but were developed without considering the imperfection of reference standard tests used for case definition. This study used a Bayesian latent class model to update Californian prediction rules. The results of clinical examination and ultrasound findings of 608 preweaned dairy calves were used. A model accounting for imperfect accuracy of thoracic ultrasound examination was used to obtain updated weights for the clinical signs included in the Californian scoring system. There were 20 points (95% Bayesian credible intervals: 11–29) for abnormal breathing pattern, 16 points (95% BCI: 4–29) for ear drop/head tilt, 16 points (95% BCI: 9–25) for cough, 10 points (95% BCI: 3–18) for the presence of nasal discharge, 7 points (95% BCI: −1 to 8) for rectal temperature ≥39.2 °C, and −1 points (95% BCI: −9 to 8) for the presence of ocular discharge. The optimal cut-offs were determined using the misclassification cost-term term (MCT) approach with different possible scenarios of expected prevalence and different plausible ratio of false negative costs/false positive costs. The predicted probabilities of active infection of the lower respiratory tract were also obtained using posterior densities of the main logistic regression model. Depending on the context, cut-off varying from 9 to 16 can minimized the MCT. The optimal cut-off decreased when expected prevalence of disease and false negative/false positive ratio increased.","Buczinski, S.; Fecteau, G.; Dubuc, J.; Francoz, D.",Prev Vet Med,140,29

Up to this day, 5,235,452 cases confirmed worldwide with 338,612 death. One of the methods to predict mortality risk is machine learning algorithm using medical features, which means it takes time. Therefore, in this study, Logistic Regression is modeled by training 114 data and used to create a prediction over the patient’s mortality using nonmedical features. The model can help hospitals and doctors to prioritize who has a high probability of death and triage patients especially when the hospital is overrun by patients. The model can accurately predict with more than 90% accuracy achieved. Further analysis found that age is the most important predictor in the patient’s mortality rate. Using this model, the death rate caused by COVID-19 could be reduced.","Josephus, Bernhard O.; Nawir, Ardianto H.; Wijaya, Evelyn; Moniaga, Jurike V.; Ohyver, Margaretha",Procedia Computer Science,140,1

The pulmonary route provides a number of advantages, including the rapid absorption which results from a high level of vascularization over a large surface area and the successful avoidance of first-pass metabolism. Aerosolization of nanoparticles (NPs) is presently under extensive investigation and exhibits a high potential for targeted delivery of therapeutic agents for the treatment of a wide range of diseases. NPs need to possess specific characteristics to facilitate their transport along the pulmonary tract and appropriately overcome the barriers presented by the pulmonary system. The most challenging aspect of delivering NP-based drugs via the pulmonary route is developing colloidal systems with the optimal physicochemical parameters for inhalation. The physiochemical properties of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been investigated as a template for synthesis of NPs to assist in the formulation of virus-like particles (VLPs) for pharmaceutical delivery, vaccine production and diagnosis assays.","Rabiei, Morteza; Kashanian, Soheila; Samavati, Seyedeh Sabereh; Derakhshankhah, Hossein; Jamasb, Shahriar; McInnes, Steven J P",Journal of drug targeting,140,20

As the first country with the COVID‐19 outbreak, the Chinese government has adopted a series of timely and strict prevention and control measures against the spread of the SARS‐CoV‐2, which has effectively slowed down the spread of the SARS‐CoV‐2 and created a valuable window for the international community to overcome the epidemic. China's experience in combating the COVID‐19 has shown that building a community prevention and control system is essential to control the spread of coronavirus. As the backbone of the epidemic prevention and control system, the community prevention and control system plays an important role in improving the pattern of disorderly medical treatment, screening suspected patients, preventing the input of pathogens, ensuring residents' medical needs, stabilizing public sentiment, reducing disease fear, and maintaining residents' national security. At the same time, it also exposed the problems of the community prevention and control epidemic system in terms of infrastructure, human resources, and internal systems. Based on this, this article suggests that we should improve the hardware facilities of community, improve the internal mechanism of the community, strengthen the stability of the community talent team, improve the level of linkage between the community and other departments to prevent and control the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2, effectively use information technology and actively mobilize social forces to help community prevention and control COVID‐19.","Zhang, Xiaoyan; Yang, Shiyu",Int J Health Plann Manage,140,1

First in vivo tests,12.371682,9.491839,2020-07-02,"Lactoferrin is a naturally occurring iron-binding glycoprotein, produced and secreted by mucosal epithelial cells and neutrophils in various mammalian species, including humans. It is typically found in fluids like saliva, milk and tears, where it reaches the maximum concentration. Thanks to its unique anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, topical application of lactoferrin plays a crucial role in the maintenance of a healthy ocular surface system. The present review aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the clinical applications of lactoferrin in ocular diseases. Besides the well-known antibacterial effect, novel interest has been rising towards its potential application in the field of dry eye and viral infections. A growing body of evidence supports the antimicrobial efficacy of lactoferrin, which is not limited to its iron-chelating properties but also depends on its capability to directly interact with pathogen particles while playing immunomodulatory effects. Nowadays, lactoferrin antiviral activity is of special interest, since lactoferrin-based eye drops could be adopted to treat/prevent the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, which has conjunctivitis among its possible clinical manifestations. In the future, further data from randomized controlled studies are desirable to confirm the efficacy of lactoferrin in the wide range of ocular conditions where it can be used.","Vagge, Aldo; Senni, Carlotta; Bernabei, Federico; Pellegrini, Marco; Scorcia, Vincenzo; Traverso, Carlo E; Giannaccare, Giuseppe",Int J Mol Sci,140,28

A primary causative agent for typical HFMD outbreaks, enterovirus 71 (EV71), has been shown to manipulate the cell cycle in S phase for own replication; however, it is not clear whether coxsackievirus (CVA6), the main agent for atypical HFMD, also regulates the host cell cycle. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that CVA6 infection arrests the host cell cycle in G0/G1-phase. Furthermore, synchronization in G0/G1 phase, but not S phase or G2/M phase, promotes viral production. To investigate the mechanism of cell cycle arrest induced by CVA6 infection, we analyzed cell cycle progression after cell cycle synchronization at G0/G1 or G2/M. Our results demonstrate that CVA6 infection promotes G0/G1 phase entry from G2/M phase, and inhibits G0/G1 exit into S phase. In line with its role to arrest cells in G0/G1 phase, the expression of cyclinD1, CDK4, cyclinE1, CDK2, cyclinB1, CDK1, P53, P21, and P16 is regulated by CVA6. Finally, the non-structural proteins of CVA6, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 3D and protease 3C , are demonstrated to be responsible for the G0/G1-phase arrest. These findings suggest that CVA6 infection arrested cell cycle in G0/G1-phase via non-structural proteins 3D and 3C, which may provide favorable environments for virus production.","Wang, Zengyan; Wang, Yue; Wang, Shaohua; Meng, Xiangling; Song, Fengmei; Huo, Wenbo; Zhang, Shuxia; Chang, Junliang; Li, Jingliang; Zheng, Baisong; Liu, Yanqiu; Zhang, Yahong; Zhang, Wenyan; Yu, Jinghua",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,140,27

Since then, the search for a vaccine or drug for COVID-19 treatment has started worldwide. In this regard, a fast approach is the repurposing of drugs, primarily antiviral drugs. Herein, we performed a virtual screening using 22 antiviral drugs retrieved from the DrugBank repository, azithromycin (antibiotic), ivermectin (antinematode), and seven non-structural proteins (Nsps) of SARS-CoV-2, which are considered important targets for drugs, via molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Drug–receptor binding energy was employed as the main descriptor. Based on the results, paritaprevir was predicted as a promising multi-target drug that favorably bound to all tested Nsps, mainly adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP) (-36.2 kcal mol(−1)) and coronavirus main proteinase (Mpro) (-32.2 kcal mol(−1)). Moreover, the results suggest that simeprevir is a strong inhibitor of Mpro (-37.2 kcal mol(−1)), which is an interesting finding because Mpro plays an important role in viral replication. In addition to drug–receptor affinity, hot spot residues were characterized to facilitate the design of new drug derivatives with improved biological responses.","Nunes, Vinicius S.; Paschoal, Diego F.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of neurology-themed blogs and/or podcasts between April 2019 and May 2020. Programs were eligible if they reported mean monthly downloads > 2000, were affiliated with an academic society, or offered continuing medical education credit. Thirty-day download counts were compared between study months, with adjustment for multiple testing. Exploratory analyses were performed to determine which podcast features were associated with higher downloads. RESULTS: Of the 12 neurology podcasts surveyed, 8 completed the survey and 5 met inclusion criteria. The median monthly download count was 2865 (IQR 869–7497), with significant variability between programs (p < 0.001). While there was a 358% increase in downloads during April 2020 when compared to the previous month, this was not significant (median 8124 [IQR 2913–14,177] vs. 2268 [IQR 540–6116], p(adj) = 0.80). The non-significant increase in overall downloads during April 2020 corresponded to an increase in unique episodes during that month (r = 0.48, p = 0.003).

In the previous our study, we demonstrated that the spike glycoprotein gene of Korean winter dysentery (WD) BCoV had a genetic property of both enteric (EBCV) and respiratory BCoV (RBCV) and were significantly distinct from the ancestral enteric strains. In the present study, therefore, we analyzed the other structure genes, the hemagglutinin/esterase (HE) protein, the transmembrane (M) protein and the small membrane (E) protein to characterize 10 WD BCoV circulated in Korea during 2002–2003 and compared the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences with the other known BCoV. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the HE gene among BCoV could be divided into three groups. The first group included only RBCV, while the second group contained calf diarrhea BCoV, RBCV, WD and EBCV, respectively. The third group possessed only all Korean WD strains which were more homologous to each other and were sharply distinct from the other known BCoV, suggesting Korean WD strains had evolutionary distinct pathway. In contrast, the relative conservation of the M and E proteins of BCoV including Korean WD strains and the other coronaviruses suggested that structural constraints on these proteins are rigid, resulting in more limited evolution of these proteins. In addition, BCoV and human coronavirus HCV-OC43 contained four potential O-glycosylation sites in the M gene. However, the M gene sequence of both BCoV and HCV-OC43 might not contain a signal peptide, suggesting the M protein might be unlikely to be exposed to the O-glycosylation machinery in vivo.","Ko, Chin-Koo; Kang, Mun-Il; Lim, Geum-Ki; Kim, Gye-Yeop; Yoon, Soon-Seek; Park, Jong-Tae; Jeong, Cheol; Park, Sung-Hee; Park, Su-Jin; Kim, You-Jung; Jeong, Jae-Ho; Kim, Sang-Ki; Park, Sang-Ilk; Kim, Ha-Hyun; Kim, Kyoung-Yoon; Cho, Kyoung-Oh",Virus Genes,140,1

Microglia and CAMs undergo essential steps of differentiation and maturation triggered by environmental factors as well as intrinsic transcriptional programs throughout embryonic and postnatal development. These shaping steps allow the macrophages to adapt to their specific physiological function as first line of defense of the CNS and its interfaces. During infancy, the CNS might be targeted by a plethora of different pathogens which can cause severe tissue damage with potentially long reaching defects. Therefore, an efficient immune response of infant CNS macrophages is required even at these early stages to clear the infections but may also lead to detrimental consequences for the developing CNS.

Results Out of 428 participants, 6.3% were between 16 and 25 years old, 22.8% between 26 and 35 years, 21.9% between 36 and 45 years, 30.5% between 45 and 55 years, 18.2% between 56 and 65 years, and 0.3% were older than 65 years. Out of all participants, 18.2% were male and 82.5% female. The results of the survey showed that 48.3% had more than 20 years of experience in nursing and 46.2% cardiac, pulmonary, or other pre-existing conditions. Work was found exhaustive while working in PPE by 96.5% of the participants, and 93% complained of worse breathing. We found out that 85.8% reported difficulties to focus. Many workplaces turned out to lack adequate heat protection, with distinct differences concerning the amount of prophylactic and heat mitigating measures across institutions. Conclusions Our results clearly show that employers must make more of an effort to provide adequate heat protection for their nursing staff.

The aims of this study were to identify the key characteristics of remote home monitoring models for COVID-19 infection, explore the experiences of staff implementing these models, understand the use of data for monitoring progress against outcomes, and document variability in staffing and resource allocation. METHODS: This was a multi-site mixed methods study conducted between July and August 2020 that combined qualitative and quantitative approaches to analyse the implementation and impact of remote home monitoring models developed during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in England. The study combined interviews (n = 22) with staff delivering these models across eight sites in England with the collection and analysis of data on staffing models and resource allocation. FINDINGS: The models varied in relation to the healthcare settings and mechanisms used for patient triage, monitoring and escalation. Implementation was embedded in existing staff workloads and budgets. Good communication within clinical teams, culturally-appropriate information for patients/carers and the combination of multiple approaches for patient monitoring (app and paper-based) were considered facilitators in implementation. The mean cost per monitored patient varied from £400 to £553, depending on the model.

As a consequence, the Swiss government decreed a public lock-down to reduce and restrict further infections. The aim of this investigation was to provide the impact of the COVID-19 lock-down on the presentations of patients in an interdisciplinary emergency department (ED). PATIENTS, MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed at an interdisciplinary Swiss ED during the lock-down period. All patients who presented to the ED were enrolled in this investigation and compared to a control cohort during the same time period in 2019. Data regarding patients’ characteristics, medical specialty, time course of presentations during the observation period, outpatient or hospital admission were analyzed. RESULTS: In total 7072 patients were included in the final analysis. During the lock-down period the number of ED presentations significantly decreased by 29% in comparison to the control period in the previous year (p < 0.0001). The analysis of the time course revealed that in each week the number of patients was lower with 13–43% reduction. Irrespective of the medical specialty, the number of presentations decreased during the COVID-19 situation, whereas this decrease was higher in surgical diseases (31%, p < 0.0001) than in non-surgical presentations (3.6%, p = 0.4).

During the last decade, substantial evidence has emerged showing that the brain modifies pulmonary responses to physical and biological stimuli by various mechanisms, including the modulation of neuroinflammatory reflexes and the onset of abnormal breathing patterns. Afferent signals and circulating factors from injured peripheral tissues, including the lung, can induce neuronal reprogramming, potentially contributing to neurocognitive dysfunction and psychological alterations seen in critically ill patients.

In a recent study, it was reported that it has the potential to treat COVID-19. In order to control the quality of commercial cobratide drugs, a protocol was established for the separation, identification and quantification of cobratide and its associated impurities, in which sheathless capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) was used for identification and a rapid capillary electrophoresis-ultraviolet-visible detector (CE-UV) method was developed for accurate quantification. Separation conditions that affect the resolution and MS intensities of cobratide and its associated impurities were investigated, including pH value, concentration of background electrolyte (BGE), ratio of organic additive and sample solution. The optimized CE conditions (BGE: 50 mM NH4Ac, pH 4.0; sample solution: deionized water) were used for both sheathless CE-MS and CE-UV methods. Three associated impurities were separated and identified for the first time by sheathless CE-MS. Then, a rapid CE-UV method was validated and used for accurate quantification of cobratide and its associated impurities. The CE-UV method showed good linearity between concentration and corrected peak area of cobratide in the concentration range of 5.36-536.30 µg mL-1. The limit of quantification of the CE-UV method was 4.16 µg mL-1. The relative standard deviations of migration time were less than 1% for both intra-day and inter-day experiments, and those of corrected peak area were less than 5%. Finally, different cobratide drugs were analyzed to evaluate the batch-to-batch consistency. This established protocol combining sheathless CE-MS and CE-UV methods would provide useful information for both quality control and process analysis of peptide drugs.","Liu, Bo; Wang, Wentao; Gao, Tie; Huang, Lu; Fan, Huihong; Chen, Hong-Xu",Anal Methods,140,24

METHODS: A scan was performed of provincial and territorial reporting of five data elements (cumulative totals of tests, cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and population size) across three units of aggregation (province or territory level, health regions, and local areas) (15 “overall” indicators), and for four vulnerable settings (long-term care and detention facilities, schools, and homeless shelters) and eight social markers (age, sex, immigration status, race/ethnicity, healthcare worker status, occupational sector, income, and education) (180 “equity-related” indicators) as of December 31, 2020. Per indicator, one point was awarded if case-delimited data were released, 0.7 points if only summary statistics were reported, and 0 if neither was provided. Results were presented using a scorecard approach. RESULTS: Overall, information was more complete for cases and deaths than for tests, hospitalizations, and population size denominators needed for rate estimation. Information provided on jurisdictions and their regions, overall, tended to be more available (average score of 58%, “D”) than that for equity-related indicators (average score of 17%, “F”). Only British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario provided case-delimited data, with Ontario and Alberta providing case information for local areas. No jurisdiction reported on outcomes according to patients’ immigration status, race/ethnicity, income, or education. Though several provinces reported on cases in long-term care facilities, only Ontario and Quebec provided detailed information for detention facilities and schools, and only Ontario reported on cases within homeless shelters and across occupational sectors. CONCLUSION: One year into the pandemic, socially stratified reporting for COVID-19 outcomes remains sparse in Canada. However, several “best practices” in health equity-oriented reporting were observed and set a relevant precedent for all jurisdictions to follow for this pandemic and future ones.

To date, data to assess the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 among pregnant U.S. women and determine whether signs and symptoms differ among pregnant and nonpregnant women are limited. During January 22-June 7, as part of COVID-19 surveillance, CDC received reports of 326,335 women of reproductive age (15-44 years) who had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Data on pregnancy status were available for 91,412 (28.0%) women with laboratory-confirmed infections; among these, 8,207 (9.0%) were pregnant. Symptomatic pregnant and nonpregnant women with COVID-19 reported similar frequencies of cough (>50%) and shortness of breath (30%), but pregnant women less frequently reported headache, muscle aches, fever, chills, and diarrhea. Chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease were more commonly reported among pregnant women than among nonpregnant women. Among women with COVID-19, approximately one third (31.5%) of pregnant women were reported to have been hospitalized compared with 5.8% of nonpregnant women. After adjusting for age, presence of underlying medical conditions, and race/ethnicity, pregnant women were significantly more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (aRR = 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2-1.8) and receive mechanical ventilation (aRR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.2-2.4). Sixteen (0.2%) COVID-19-related deaths were reported among pregnant women aged 15-44 years, and 208 (0.2%) such deaths were reported among nonpregnant women (aRR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.5-1.5). These findings suggest that among women of reproductive age with COVID-19, pregnant women are more likely to be hospitalized and at increased risk for ICU admission and receipt of mechanical ventilation compared with nonpregnant women, but their risk for death is similar. To reduce occurrence of severe illness from COVID-19, pregnant women should be counseled about the potential risk for severe illness from COVID-19, and measures to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 should be emphasized for pregnant women and their families.","Ellington, Sascha; Strid, Penelope; Tong, Van T.; Woodworth, Kate; Galang, Romeo R.; Zambrano, Laura D.; Nahabedian, John; Anderson, Kayla; Gilboa, Suzanne M.",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,140,28

Although previous research identified several reliable predictors of truth judgments—such as source credibility, repeated information exposure, and presentation format—little is known about their simultaneous effects. In a series of four experiments, we investigated how the abovementioned factors jointly affect the perceived truth of statements (Experiments 1 and 2) and simulated social media postings (Experiments 3 and 4). Experiment 1 explored the role of source credibility (high vs. low vs. no source information) and presentation format (with vs. without a picture). In Experiments 2 and 3, we additionally manipulated repeated exposure (yes vs. no). Finally, Experiment 4 examined the role of source credibility (high vs. low) and type of repetition (congruent vs. incongruent vs. no repetition) in further detail. In sum, we found no effect of presentation format on truth judgments, but strong, additive effects of source credibility and repetition. Truth judgments were higher for information presented by credible sources than non-credible sources and information without sources. Moreover, congruent (i.e., verbatim) repetition increased perceived truth whereas semantically incongruent repetition decreased perceived truth, irrespectively of the source. Our findings show that people do not rely on a single judgment cue when evaluating a statement’s truth but take source credibility and their meta-cognitive feelings into account.","Nadarevic, Lena; Reber, Rolf; Helmecke, Anne Josephine; Köse, Dilara",Cogn Res Princ Implic,140,1

Due to critical role of spike protein in cell entry and pathogenesis, mutations in spike regions have been reported to enhance transmissibility, disease severity, possible escape from vaccine‐induced immune response and reduced diagnostic sensitivity/specificity. Considering the structure‐function impact of mutations, understanding the molecular details of these key mutations of newly emerged variants/lineages is of urgent concern. In this review, we have explored the literature on key spike mutations harbored by alpha, beta, gamma and delta ‘variants of concern’ (VOCs) and discussed their molecular consequences in the context of resultant virus biology. Commonly all these VOCs i.e. B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1 and B.1.617.2 lineages have decisive mutation in Receptor Binding Motif (RBM) region and/or region around Furin cleavage site (FCS) of spike protein. In general, mutation induced disruption of intra‐molecular interaction enhances molecular flexibility leading to exposure of spike protein surface in these lineages to make it accessible for inter‐molecular interaction with hACE2. A disruption of spike antigen‐antibody inter‐molecular interactions in epitope region due to the chemical nature of substituting amino acid hampers the neutralization efficacy. Simplified surveillance of mutation induced changes and their consequences at molecular level can contribute in rationalizing mutation‘s impact on virus biology. It is believed that molecular level dissection of these key spike mutation will assist the future investigations for a more resilient outcome against severity of COVID‐19.","Joshi, Nilesh; Tyagi, Adish; Nigam, Sandeep",ChemistrySelect,140,24

Assumptions about the presence and relative importance of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission are based on case reports, the failing of quarantine measures aimed at sequestering ill patients, viral dynamic studies suggesting SARS-CoV-2 production peaks before symptoms appear, and modeling evidence that calculates serial interval between successive generations of infection. In aggregate, these data offer compelling evidence of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission, but individually these studies have notable shortcomings that undermine their conclusions. The purpose of this review is to discuss the literature of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission, highlight limitations of recent studies, and propose experiments that, if conducted, would provide a more definitive analysis of the relative role of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission in the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of literature on PubMed using search filters that relate to asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission as well as serial interval and viral dynamics. We focused on studies that provided primary clinical data. RESULTS: 34 studies were eligible for inclusion in this systematic review: 11 case reports pertaining to asymptomatic transmission, 9 viral kinetic studies, 13 serial interval studies, and 1 study with viral kinetics and serial interval. CONCLUSION: Different approaches to determining the presence and prevalence of asymptomatic and presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 transmission have notable shortcomings, which were highlighted in this review and limit our ability to draw definitive conclusions. Conducting high quality studies with the aim of understanding the relative role of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission is instrumental to developing the most informed policies on reopening our cities, states, and countries.","Savvides, Christina; Siegel, Robert",medRxiv,140,26

Social distancing is considered an essential strategy to reduce transmission in the absence of vaccination or treatment. While interventions have been successful in controlling COVID-19 in Korea, maintaining the current restrictions incurs great social costs. Thus, it is important to analyze the impact of different polices on the spread of the epidemic. To model the COVID-19 outbreak, we use an extended age-structured SEIR model with quarantine and isolation compartments. The model is calibrated to age-specific cumulative confirmed cases provided by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA). Four control measures—school closure, social distancing, quarantine, and isolation—are investigated. Because the infectiousness of the exposed has been controversial, we study two major scenarios, considering contributions to infection of the exposed, the quarantined, and the isolated. Assuming the transmission rate would increase more than 1.7 times after the end of social distancing, a second outbreak is expected in the first scenario. The epidemic threshold for increase of contacts between teenagers after school reopening is 3.3 times, which brings the net reproduction number to 1. The threshold values are higher in the second scenario. If the average time taken until isolation and quarantine reduces from three days to two, cumulative cases are reduced by 60% and 47% in the first scenario, respectively. Meanwhile, the reduction is 33% and 41%, respectively, for rapid isolation and quarantine in the second scenario. Without social distancing, a second wave is possible, irrespective of whether we assume risk of infection by the exposed. In the non-infectivity of the exposed scenario, early detection and isolation are significantly more effective than quarantine. Furthermore, quarantining the exposed is as important as isolating the infectious when we assume that the exposed also contribute to infection.","Lee, Taeyong; Kwon, Hee-Dae; Lee, Jeehyun",PLoS One,140,1

Method: Physicians deliver focused meditation while medical assistants taught yoga. Three sessions were administered biweekly with recommendations for daily practice. Pain severity Likert scores were compared with a treatment as usual (TAU) historical control. Anxiety scores were compared from baseline in the PD group. Results: Thirty PD patients aged 9–17 (20 female) and 52 consecutive TAU group aged 5–17 (33 female) were reviewed. The biweekly sessions had high (71%) completion rates. Utilization rates of PD were similar to TAU despite added sessions. The PD group had an average time of follow-up of 8.9 ± 9.4 vs. 6.0 ± 3.9 months in the TAU group (p = 0.522). Changes in pain scores from baseline showed improvement in the PD group, 0.67 ± 0.13 vs. TAU 1.39 ± 0.11 (p = 0.0003). In the PD group, anxiety scores improved significantly from baseline (0.5 vs. 1, P < 0.001). Pain improved in 93% (28/30) and resolved in 47% (14/30). Conclusion: A short course of PD was successfully embedded in a busy pediatric office without additional staffing. The approach proved cost-effective without increasing overall healthcare utilization and showed significant benefits over TAU. Pending RCT confirmation, this offers a cost-effective method to incorporate mind–body techniques into a pediatric office practice.","Mehta, Vijay; Mehta, Akshay; Patel, Samit; Irastorza, Laura; Rizvi, Syed Ahsan; Abomoelak, Bassam; Mehta, Naina; Mehta, Devendra",Front Pediatr,140,16

Traditional systematic literature review studies have restrictions, including analyzing a limited number of papers, having various biases, being time-consuming and labor-intensive, focusing on a few topics, and lack of data-driven tools. This research has collected 9,298 papers representing COVID-19 research published through May 5, 2020. We used frequency analysis to find highly frequent manifestations and therapeutic chemicals, representing the importance of the two biomedical concepts. This study also applied topic modeling that provided 25 categories showing associations between the two overarching categories. This study is beneficial to researchers for obtaining a macro-level picture of literature, to educators for knowing the scope of literature, and to policymakers and funding agencies for creating scientific strategic plans regarding COVID-19.","Karami, Amir; Bookstaver, Brandon; Nolan, Melissa; Bozorgi, Parisa",,140,22

However, there are challenges associated with determination of orthology between neuropeptides in different taxa. Orthologs of vertebrate neuropeptide-Y (NPY) known as neuropeptide-F (NPF) have been identified in protostome invertebrates, whilst prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP) and short neuropeptide-F (sNPF) have been identified as paralogs of NPY/NPF in vertebrates and protostomes, respectively. Here we investigated the occurrence of NPY/NPF/PrRP/sNPF-related signalling systems in a deuterostome invertebrate phylum – the Echinodermata. Analysis of transcriptome/genome sequence data revealed loss of NPY/NPF-type signalling, but orthologs of PrRP-type neuropeptides and sNPF/PrRP-type receptors were identified in echinoderms. Furthermore, experimental studies revealed that the PrRP-type neuropeptide pQDRSKAMQAERTGQLRRLNPRF-NH(2) is a potent ligand for a sNPF/PrRP-type receptor in the starfish Asterias rubens. Our findings indicate that PrRP-type and sNPF-type signalling systems are orthologous and originated as a paralog of NPY/NPF-type signalling in Urbilateria.","Yañez-Guerra, Luis Alfonso; Zhong, Xingxing; Moghul, Ismail; Butts, Thomas; Zampronio, Cleidiane G; Jones, Alexandra M; Mirabeau, Olivier; Elphick, Maurice R",eLife,140,20

However, one of the principal challenges in leveraging artificial intelligence technology in the health care setting has been the relative inability to translate models into clinician workflow. OBJECTIVE: Here we demonstrate the development of a COVID-19 outcome prediction app that utilizes an ANN and assesses its usability in the clinical setting. METHODS: Usability assessment was conducted using the app, followed by a semistructured end-user interview. Usability was specified by effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction measures. These data were reported with descriptive statistics. The end-user interview data were analyzed using the thematic framework method, which allowed for the development of themes from the interview narratives. In total, 31 National Health Service physicians at a West London teaching hospital, including foundation physicians, senior house officers, registrars, and consultants, were included in this study. RESULTS: All participants were able to complete the assessment, with a mean time to complete separate patient vignettes of 59.35 (SD 10.35) seconds. The mean system usability scale score was 91.94 (SD 8.54), which corresponds to a qualitative rating of “excellent.” The clinicians found the app intuitive and easy to use, with the majority describing its predictions as a useful adjunct to their clinical practice. The main concern was related to the use of the app in isolation rather than in conjunction with other clinical parameters. However, most clinicians speculated that the app could positively reinforce or validate their clinical decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: Translating artificial intelligence technologies into the clinical setting remains an important but challenging task. We demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and system usability of a web-based app designed to predict the outcomes of patients with COVID-19 from an ANN.","Abdulaal, Ahmed; Patel, Aatish; Al-Hindawi, Ahmed; Charani, Esmita; Alqahtani, Saleh A; Davies, Gary W; Mughal, Nabeela; Moore, Luke Stephen Prockter",JMIR Form Res,140,1

Gastrointestinal manifestations such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are commonly associated with this condition. Biliary complications from COVID-19 constitute an area of active research. In this report, we present a case of secondary sclerosing cholangitis in a critically ill patient (SSC-CIP) associated with COVID-19. A 57-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension and diabetes presented to the hospital with signs of sepsis. He had abdominal pain, fever, and elevated liver enzymes without an elevated lipase. Abdominal ultrasound and CT scan showed a dilated common bile duct (CBD) with a distal CBD stone. He had experienced a prolonged course of severe critical illness related to COVID-19 prior to this episode, with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, thromboembolic complications, and he had also required tracheostomy and gastrostomy tube. The patient was diagnosed with cholangitis and was appropriately treated with antibiotics and fluid resuscitation. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed. During ERCP, the biliary cast was removed and a bile duct stent was placed. After the procedure, he showed significant improvement and was discharged on an appropriate course of antibiotics. Outpatient ERCP was eventually done to remove the stent and further bile duct casts were removed. The patient was referred for outpatient cholecystectomy. Critical illness due to COVID-19 can result in SSC-CIP. This can be further complicated by bile duct casts, liver fibrosis, and cirrhosis.","Sanders, David; Bomman, Shivanand; Irani, Shayan",Cureus,140,24

This novel virus can be found on various surfaces in contaminated sites such as clinical places, however, the behaviour and molecular interactions of the virus with respect to the surfaces are poorly understood. Regarding this, the virus adsorption onto solid surfaces can play a critical role in transmission and survival in various environments. In this article, firstly an overview of existing knowledge concerning viral spread, molecular structure of SARS-CoV-2, and the virus surface stability is presented. Then, we highlight potential drivers of the SARS-CoV-2 surface adsorption and stability in various environmental conditions. This theoretical analysis shows that different surface and environmental conditions including temperature, humidity, and pH are crucial considerations in building fundamental understanding of the virus transmission and thereby improving safety practices.","Joonaki, Edris; Hassanpouryouzband, Aliakbar; Heldt, Caryn L.; Areo, Oluwatoyin",Chem,140,1

A phylogenetic tree has been built using the 15 available whole genome sequence of 2019-nCoV and 12 whole genome sequences highly similar sequences available in gene bank (5 from SARS, 2 from MERS and 5 from Bat SARS-like Coronavirus). FUBAR analysis shows that the Nucleocapsid and the Spike Glycoprotein has some sites under positive pressure while homology modelling helped to explain some molecular and structural differences between the viruses. The phylogenetic tree showed that 2019.nCoV significantly clustered with Bat SARS-like Coronavirus sequence isolated in 2015, whereas structural analysis revealed mutation in S and nucleocapsid proteins. From these results, 2019nCoV could be considered a coronavirus distinct from SARS virus, probably transmitted from bats or another host where mutations conferred upon it the ability to infect humans.","Benvenuto, Domenico; Giovannetti, Marta; Ciccozzi, Alessandra; Spoto, Silvia; Angeletti, Silvia; Ciccozzi, Massimo",bioRxiv,140,1

New technologies present novel opportunities and challenges, and globalisation has created new pathways and increased the speed, volume and routes by which organisms can spread. The UK Biological Security Strategy (2018) acknowledges the importance of research on biological security in the UK. Given the breadth of potential research, a targeted agenda identifying the questions most critical to effective and coordinated progress in different disciplines of biological security is required. We used expert elicitation to generate 80 policy-relevant research questions considered by participants to have the greatest impact on UK biological security. Drawing on a collaboratively-developed set of 450 questions, proposed by 41 experts from academia, industry and the UK government (consulting 168 additional experts) we subdivided the final 80 questions into six categories: bioengineering; communication and behaviour; disease threats (including pandemics); governance and policy; invasive alien species; and securing biological materials and securing against misuse. Initially, the questions were ranked through a voting process and then reduced and refined to 80 during a one-day workshop with 35 participants from a variety of disciplines. Consistently emerging themes included: the nature of current and potential biological security threats, the efficacy of existing management actions, and the most appropriate future options. The resulting questions offer a research agenda for biological security in the UK that can assist the targeting of research resources and inform the implementation of the UK Biological Security Strategy. These questions include research that could aid with the mitigation of Covid-19, and preparation for the next pandemic. We hope that our structured and rigorous approach to creating a biological security research agenda will be replicated in other countries and regions. The world, not just the UK, is in need of a thoughtful approach to directing biological security research to tackle the emerging issues.","Kemp, Luke; Aldridge, David C.; Booy, Olaf; Bower, Hilary; Browne, Des; Burgmann, Mark; Burt, Austin; Cunningham, Andrew A.; Dando, Malcolm; Dick, Jaimie T.

Immunotherapy with convalescent plasma (CPT) is one such therapeutic option. Methods: A systematized search was conducted for articles published between December 2019 and 18th January 2021 focusing on convalescent plasma efficacy and safety in COVID-19. The primary outcomes were defined as mortality benefit in patients treated with convalescent plasma compared to standard therapy/placebo. The secondary outcome was pooled mortality rate and the adverse event rate in convalescent plasma-treated patients. Results: A total of 27,706 patients were included in the qualitative analysis, and a total of 3,262 (2,127 in convalescent plasma-treated patients and 1,135 in the non-convalescent plasma/control group) patients died. The quantitative synthesis in 23 studies showed that the odds of mortality in patients who received plasma therapy were significantly lower than those in patients who did not receive plasma therapy [odds ratio (OR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53–0.80, p < 0.0001, I(2) = 15%). The mortality benefit remains the same even for 14 trials/prospective studies (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.43–0.81, p = 0.001, I(2) = 22%) as well as for nine case series/retrospective observational studies (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.65–0.94, p = 0.01, I(2) = 0%). However, in a subgroup analysis for 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), there was no statistically significant reduction in mortality between the CPT group compared to the non-CPT group (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.53–1.08, p = 0.13, I(2) = 7%). Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis of 10 RCTs, excluding the study with the highest statistical weight, displayed a lower mortality rate compared to that of non-CPT COVID-19 patients (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.42–0.97, p = 0.04, I(2) = 0%). The observed pooled mortality rate was 12.9% (95% CI 9.7–16.9%), and the pooled adverse event rate was 6.1% (95% CI 3.2–11.6), with significant heterogeneity. Conclusions and Relevance: Our systemic review and meta-analysis suggests that CPT could be an effective therapeutic option with promising evidence on the safety and reduced mortality in concomitant treatment for COVID-19 along with antiviral/antimicrobial drugs, steroids, and other supportive care. Future exploratory studies could benefit from more standardized reporting, especially in terms of the timing of interventions and clinically relevant outcomes, like days until discharge from the hospital and improvement of clinical symptoms.","Bansal, Vikas; Mahapure, Kiran S.; Mehra, Ishita; Bhurwal, Abhishek; Tekin, Aysun; Singh, Romil; Gupta, Ishita; Rathore, Sawai Singh; Khan, Hira; Deshpande, Sohiel; Gulati, Shivam; Armaly, Paige; Sheraton, Mack; Kashyap, Rahul",Front Med (Lausanne),140,16

First efficacy data have been recently reported in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We here report on the combined antiviral effect of both drugs in a SARS-CoV-2 Syrian hamster infection model. The infected hamsters were treated twice daily with the vehicle (the control group) or a suboptimal dose of each compound or a combination of both compounds. FINDINGS: When animals were treated with a combination of suboptimal doses of Molnupiravir and Favipiravir at the time of infection, a marked combined potency at endpoint is observed. Infectious virus titers in the lungs of animals treated with the combination are reduced by ∼5 log10 and infectious virus are no longer detected in the lungs of >60% of treated animals. When start of treatment was delayed with one day a reduction of titers in the lungs of 2.4 log10 was achieved. Moreover, treatment of infected animals nearly completely prevented transmission to co-housed untreated sentinels. Both drugs result in an increased mutation frequency of the remaining viral RNA recovered from the lungs of treated animals. In the combo-treated hamsters, an increased frequency of C-to-T mutations in the viral RNA is observed as compared to the single treatment groups which may explain the pronounced antiviral potency of the combination. Interpretation: Our findings may lay the basis for the design of clinical studies to test the efficacy of the combination of Molnupiravir/Favipiravir in the treatment of COVID-19.

Nowadays, a wide range of animals is present in human households as pets, including reptiles, amphibians, dogs, cats, ornamental birds, and rodents. Pets contaminate the environment of their owners by shedding the bacteria intermittently in their feaces. In consequence, theyare thought to cause salmonellosis through pet-to-human transmission. Each Salmonella serovar has a different zoonotic potential, which is strongly regulated by stress factors such as transportation, crowding, food deprivation, or temperature. In this review, we summarize the latest reports concerning Salmonella-prevalence and distribution in pets as well as the risk factors and means of prevention of human salmonellosis caused by contact with their pets. Our literature analysis (based on PubMed and Google Scholar databases) is limited to the distribution of Salmonella serovars found in commonly owned pet species.

Environmental disasters, natural and human-made activities raise risk factors that indirectly facilitate infectious disease outbreaks. Subsequently, changes in habitat, displaced populations, and environmental stresses that affect the survival of species are amplified over time. The recurrence and spread of vector-borne (e.g., mosquito, tick, aphid) human, animal, and plant pathogens to new geographic locations are also influenced by climate change. The distribution and range of humans, agricultural animals and plants, wildlife and native plants, as well as vectors, parasites, and microbes that cause neglected diseases of the tropics as well as other global regions are also impacted. In addition, genomic sequencing can now be applied to detect signatures of infectious pathogens as they move into new regions. Molecular detection assays complement metagenomic sequencing to help us understand the microbial community found within the microbiomes of hosts and vectors, and help us uncover mechanistic relationships between climate variability and pathogen transmission. Our understanding of, and responses to, such complex dynamics and their impacts can be enhanced through effective, multi-sectoral One Health engagement coupled with applications of both traditional and novel technologies. Concerted efforts are needed to further harness and leverage technology that can identify and track these impacts of climate changes in order to mitigate and adapt to their effects.","B.
