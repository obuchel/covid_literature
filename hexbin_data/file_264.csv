906,Symptomatic Venous Thromboembolism Is a Disease Related to Infection and Immune Dysfunction,2012-07-26,"The characteristics of human genomics and cellular immune function between clinically symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) and controls were systematically compared to explore the immunologic pathogenesis of VTE. Microarray assay showed the mRNA expressions of genes related to non-specific cellarer immune and cytokines were significantly down-regulated. Abnormal expressions of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, NK marker CD16+56+, CD19 and aberrant CD4+/CD8+ ratio were detected in 54 among 56 patients. In PE patients, microarray assay revealed the imbalance in the expressions of genes related to the immune system. The expressions of genes related to non-specific immune cells and cytokines were markedly up-regulated and those associated with cellular immune were dramatically down-regulated. In VTE patients, cytological examination indicated the functions of NK cells were significantly compromised, and the antigen recognition and killing function of T cells markedly decreased. The consistence between genomic and cytological examination suggests the symptomatic VTE is closely associated with the infection and immune dysfunction.","Duan, Qianglin; Gong, Zhu; Song, Haoming; Wang, Lemin; Yang, Fan; Lv, Wei; Song, Yanli",Int J Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3410365/,264
1116,Trends in North American Newspaper Reporting of Brain Injury in Ice Hockey,2013-04-17,"The frequency and potential long-term effects of sport-related traumatic brain injuries (TBI) make it a major public health concern. The culture within contact sports, such as ice hockey, encourages aggression that puts youth at risk of TBI such as concussion. Newspaper reports play an important role in conveying and shaping the culture around health-related behaviors. We qualitatively studied reports about sport-related TBI in four major North American newspapers over the last quarter-century. We used the grounded-theory approach to identify major themes and then did a content analysis to compare the frequency of key themes between 1998–2000 and 2009–2011. The major themes were: perceptions of brain injury, aggression, equipment, rules and regulations, and youth hockey. Across the full study period, newspaper articles from Canada and America portrayed violence and aggression that leads to TBI both as integral to hockey and as an unavoidable risk associated with playing the game. They also condemned violence in ice hockey, criticized the administrative response to TBI, and recognized the significance of TBI. In Canada, aggression was reported more often recently and there was a distinctive shift in portraying protective equipment as a solution to TBI in earlier years to a potential contributing factor to TBI later in the study period. American newspapers gave a greater attention to ‘perception of risks’ and the role of protective equipment, and discussed TBI in a broader context in the recent time period. Newspapers from both countries showed similar recent trends in regards to a need for rule changes to curb youth sport-related TBI. This study provides a rich description of the reporting around TBI in contact sport. Understanding this reporting is important for evaluating whether the dangers of sport-related TBI are being appropriately communicated by the media.","Cusimano, Michael D.; Sharma, Bhanu; Lawrence, David W.; Ilie, Gabriela; Silverberg, Sarah; Jones, Rochelle",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3629225/,264
1518,From gene to protein—experimental and clinical studies of ACE2 in blood pressure control and arterial hypertension,2014-06-24,"Hypertension is a major risk factor for stroke, coronary events, heart and renal failure, and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a major role in its pathogenesis. Within the RAS, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin (Ang) I into the vasoconstrictor Ang II. An “alternate” arm of the RAS now exists in which ACE2 counterbalances the effects of the classic RAS through degradation of Ang II, and generation of the vasodilator Ang 1-7. ACE2 is highly expressed in the heart, blood vessels, and kidney. The catalytically active ectodomain of ACE2 undergoes shedding, resulting in ACE2 in the circulation. The ACE2 gene maps to a quantitative trait locus on the X chromosome in three strains of genetically hypertensive rats, suggesting that ACE2 may be a candidate gene for hypertension. It is hypothesized that disruption of tissue ACE/ACE2 balance results in changes in blood pressure, with increased ACE2 expression protecting against increased blood pressure, and ACE2 deficiency contributing to hypertension. Experimental hypertension studies have measured ACE2 in either the heart or kidney and/or plasma, and have reported that deletion or inhibition of ACE2 leads to hypertension, whilst enhancing ACE2 protects against the development of hypertension, hence increasing ACE2 may be a therapeutic option for the management of high blood pressure in man. There have been relatively few studies of ACE2, either at the gene or the circulating level in patients with hypertension. Plasma ACE2 activity is low in healthy subjects, but elevated in patients with cardiovascular risk factors or cardiovascular disease. Genetic studies have investigated ACE2 gene polymorphisms with either hypertension or blood pressure, and have produced largely inconsistent findings. This review discusses the evidence regarding ACE2 in experimental hypertension models and the association between circulating ACE2 activity and ACE2 polymorphisms with blood pressure and arterial hypertension in man.","Patel, Sheila K.; Velkoska, Elena; Freeman, Melanie; Wai, Bryan; Lancefield, Terase F.; Burrell, Louise M.",Front Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4067757/,264
1572,"Tumour necrosis factor, interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 are possibly involved in Plasmodium vivax-associated thrombocytopaenia in southern Pakistani population",2014-08-16,"BACKGROUND: In Pakistan, Plasmodium vivax is endemic causing approximately 70% of the malaria cases. A number of haematological changes, especially thrombocytopaenia have been reported for P. vivax. Several host factors including cell-mediated immune cells, such as IL-1, IL-6 and IL-10 have been documented for P. vivax-induced thrombocytopaenia. However, study on correlation of cytokines and thrombocytopaenia in P. vivax, particularly in patients with severe signs and symptoms has not been reported from Pakistan. METHODS: A case control study to correlate TNF, IL-6 and IL-10 in healthy controls and thrombocytopaenic P. vivax-infected patients (both uncomplicated and complicated cases) from southern Pakistan was carried out during January 2009 to December 2011. One Hundred and eighty two patients presenting with microscopy-confirmed asexual P. vivax mono-infection and 100 healthy controls were enrolled in the study at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed for determination of TNF, IL-6 and IL-10 levels. RESULTS: Out of 182 cases, mild thrombocytopaenia (platelet count 100,000-150,000 mm(3)) was observed in ten (5.5%), moderate (50,000-100,000 mm(3)) in 93 (51.1%), and profound thrombocytopaenia (<50,000 mm(3)) was detected in 79 (43.4%) patients. IL-6 and IL-10 levels were found approximately three-fold higher in the mild cases compared to healthy controls. Two-fold increase in TNF and IL-10 (p < 0.0001) was observed in profound thrombocytopaenic when compared with moderate cases, while IL-6 was not found to be significantly elevated. CONCLUSION: Cytokines may have a possible role in P. vivax-induced thrombocytopaenia in Pakistani population. Findings from this study give first insight from Pakistan on the role of cytokines in P.vivax-associated thrombocytopaenia. However, further studies are required to understand the relevance of cytokines in manifestations of thrombocytopaenia in P. vivax malaria.","Raza, Afsheen; Khan, Muhammad Shahzeb; Ghanchi, Najia Karim; Raheem, Ahmed; Beg, Mohammad A",Malar J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4141950/,264
1701,"Resistance Prediction in AML: Analysis of 4,601 Patients from MRC/NCRI, HOVON/SAKK, SWOG, and MD Anderson Cancer Center",2014-08-12,"Therapeutic resistance remains the principal problem in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We used area under receiver operator characteristic curves (AUC) to quantify our ability to predict therapeutic resistance in individual patients where AUC=1.0 denotes perfect prediction and AUC=0.5 denotes a coin flip, using data from 4,601 patients with newly diagnosed AML given induction therapy with 3+7 or more intense standard regimens in MRC/NCRI, HOVON, SWOG, and MD Anderson Cancer Center studies. Age, performance status, white blood cell count, secondary disease, cytogenetic risk, and FLT3-ITD/NPM1 mutation status were each independently associated with failure to achieve complete remission despite no early death (“primary refractoriness”). However, the AUC of a bootstrap-corrected multivariable model predicting this outcome was only 0.78, indicating only fair predictive ability. Removal of FLT3-ITD and NPM1 information only slightly decreased the AUC (0.76). Prediction of resistance, defined as primary refractoriness or short relapse-free survival (RFS), was even more difficult. Our ability to forecast resistance based on routinely available pre-treatment covariates provides a rationale for continued randomization between standard and new therapies and supports further examination of genetic and post-treatment data to optimize resistance prediction in AML.","Walter, Roland B.; Othus, Megan; Burnett, Alan K.; Löwenberg, Bob; Kantarjian, Hagop M.; Ossenkoppele, Gert J.; Hills, Robert K.; Ravandi, Farhad; Pabst, Thomas; Evans, Anna; Pierce, Sherry R.; Vekemans, Marie-Christiane; Appelbaum, Frederick R.; Estey, Elihu H.",Leukemia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4318722/,264
3793,Efficacy of traditional Chinese medication Tangminling pill in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes,2019-04-30,"The morbidity of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been increasing rapidly worldwide. Tangminling pill, consisting of ten Chinese herbal medications, is usually prescribed for T2DM in mainland China. Whether treatment with Tangminling can improve clinical outcomes of T2DM patients was still debated. Four studies comparing Tangminling vs. placebo treatment in T2DM patients were included and 767 T2DM patients were enrolled in our analyses. Tangminling treatment exhibited better efficacy than placebo in reducing hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (1.11 vs. 0.32%; pooled weighted mean difference [WMD]: 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.65–0.96; P<0.001), fasting plasma glucose (0.82 vs. −0.40 mM; WMD: 1.10; 95% CI: 0.56–1.64; P<0.001), 2-h postprandial glucose (2-hr PG) (2.81 vs. 1.11 mM; WMD: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.72–1.88; P<0.001), homeostatic model assessment-β level (4.28 vs. 0.41; WMD: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.27–0.61; P<0.001), waist circumference (WC) (1.04 vs. 0.36 cm; WMD: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.37–1.19; P<0.001) and body weight index (0.37 vs. 0.11 kg/m(2); WMD: 0.30; 95% CI: −0.00 to 0.61; P=0.05).

4615,Intractable mechanical hemolytic anemia complicating mitral valve surgery: a case series study,2020-03-03,"INTRODUCTION: Patient safety and critical care quality remain a challenging issue in the ICU. However, the effects of the national quality improvement (QI) program remain unknown in China. METHODS: A national ICU QI program was implemented in a controlled cohort of 586 hospitals from 2016 to 2018. The effects of the QI program on critical care quality were comprehensively investigated. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 81,461,554 patients were enrolled in 586 hospitals, and 1,587,724 patients were admitted to the ICU over 3 years. In 2018, there was a significantly higher number of ICU beds (2016 vs. 2018: 10668 vs. 13,661, P = 0.0132) but a lower doctor-to-bed ratio (2016 vs. 2018: 0.64 (0.50, 0.83) vs. 0.60 (0.45, 0.75), P = 0.0016) and nurse-to-bed ratio (2016 vs. 2018: 2.00 (1.64, 2.50) vs. 2.00 (1.50, 2.40), P = 0.031) than in 2016. Continuous and significant improvements in the ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) incidence rate, microbiology detection rate before antibiotic use and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis rate were associated with the implementation of the QI program (VAP incidence rate (per 1000 ventilator-days), 2016 vs. 2017 vs. 2018: 11.06 (4.23, 22.70) vs. 10.20 (4.25, 23.94) vs. 8.05 (3.13, 17.37), P = 0.0002; microbiology detection rate before antibiotic use (%), 2016 vs. 2017 vs. 2018: 83.91 (49.75, 97.87) vs. 84.14 (60.46, 97.24) vs. 90.00 (69.62, 100), P < 0.0001; DVT prophylaxis rate, 2016 vs. 2017 vs. 2018: 74.19 (33.47, 96.16) vs. 71.70 (38.05, 96.28) vs. 83.27 (47.36, 97.77), P = 0.0093). Moreover, the 6-h SSC bundle compliance rates in 2018 were significantly higher than those in 2016 (6-h SSC bundle compliance rate, 2016 vs. 2018: 64.93 (33.55, 93.06) vs. 76.19 (46.88, 96.67)). A significant change trend was not found in the ICU mortality rate from 2016 to 2018 (ICU mortality rate (%), 2016 vs. 2017 vs. 2018: 8.49 (4.42, 14.82) vs. 8.95 (4.89, 15.70) vs. 9.05 (5.12, 15.80), P = 0.1075). CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between medical human resources and ICU overexpansion was mismatched during the past 3 years. The implementation of a national QI program improved ICU performance but did not reduce ICU mortality.","He, Huaiwu; Ma, Xudong; Su, Longxiang; Wang, Lu; Guo, Yanhong; Shan, Guangliang; He, Hui Jing; Zhou, Xiang; Liu, Dawei; Long, Yun; Zhao, Yupei; Zhang, Shuyang",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7057512/,264
6608,Early use of beta-blockers attenuates systemic inflammatory response and lung oxygenation impairment after distal type acute aortic dissection,2008-09-20,"Malaria is the most relevant parasitic disease worldwide, and severe malaria is characterized by cerebral edema, acute lung injury (ALI), and multiple organ dysfunctions; however, the mechanisms of lung damage need to be better clarified. In this study, we used Kunming outbred mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbANKA) to elucidate the profiles of T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-3 (Tim-3) and its ligand galecin-9 (Gal-9) in the development of ALI. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 10(6) PbANKA-infected red blood cells. The lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes (MLNs) were harvested at days 5, 10, 15, and 20 post infections (p.i.). The grade of lung injury was histopathologically evaluated. Tim-3- and Gal-9-positive cells in the lungs and MLNs were stained by immunohistochemistry, and the messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions of Tim-3, Gal-9, and related cytokines were assessed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) analyses were performed from days 18 to 20 p.i. The results showed that the pathological severities in the lungs were increased with times and the total protein level in the BALFs was significantly elevated in PbANKA-infected mice. The numbers of Gal-9(+) and Tim-3(+) cells in the lungs were significantly increased, and the mRNA levels of both Gal-9 and Tim-3 in the lungs and MLNs were over-expressed in PbANKA-infected mice. In conclusion, our data suggested that Tim-3/Gal-9 may play a role in PbANKA-induced ALI.","Liu, Jinfeng; Xiao, Siyu; Huang, Shiguang; Pei, Fuquan; Lu, Fangli",Parasitol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101834/,264

6716,Non-Hepatic Abdominal Surgery in Patients with Cirrhotic Liver Disease,2018-11-21,"Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is a recently described membrane-bound carboxypeptidase identified by its homology to ACE, the enzyme responsible for the formation of the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II (Ang II). ACE2 inactivates Ang II and is thus thought to act in a counter-regulatory fashion to ACE. ACE2 is highly expressed in epithelial cells of distal renal tubules, and recent evidence indicates that expression is increased in a range of renal diseases. A soluble form of ACE, generated by proteolytic cleavage of the membrane-bound form, has been shown to be present in urine; although evidence for a similar release of ACE2 has been reported in cell culture, it is not yet known whether this occurs in vivo. The present study has identified ACE2 in human urine, both by a sensitive fluorescence-based activity assay and by Western immunoblot. Levels of ACE2 were surprisingly higher than ACE, which may reflect preferential targeting of the enzyme to the luminal surface of the renal epithelium. Future studies will determine whether increased expression of ACE2 in renal diseases are reflected in higher urinary levels of this novel enzyme.","Lew, Rebecca A.; Warner, Fiona J.; Hanchapola, Iresha; Smith, A.

11020,Diagnosis and Management of Tuberculous Pericarditis: What Is New?,2020-01-15,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Clinical risks and advantages of both continuous feeding and intermittent feeding for preterm infants have been presented in previous studies. To determine the most appropriate feeding method for low-birth-weight infants, a meta-analysis was conducted. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Articles related to this topic were searched in PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library electronic database from the onset to May 2019. Heterogeneity analysis was performed with Chi-square and I(2) test. Pooled analysis was based on fixed effects model, if heterogeneity between the eligible studies was negligible (I(2) < 50%, P > 0.05). In contrast, a random effects model was carried out. The quality of including studies were evaluated by Cochrane assessment tool. RESULTS: A total of 1030 articles identified. Altogether, eight articles including 707 infants were included in final analysis based on eligibility criteria. In continuous feeding infants, time to achieving full feeds was longer (weight mean difference 0.98 (95% CI 0.26–1.71, P = 0.008) days) compared with intermittent feeding infants. Pooled analysis indicated there were no significant difference in other variables such as feeding intolerance, duration of hospitalization, days to regain birth weight, days to first successful oral feeding, duration of parenteral feeding, weight growth, length increment, head circumference growth, proven necrotizing enterocolitis, and probable necrotizing enterocolitis. In subgroup analysis for birth weight (<1000 g and >1000 g), we did not identify significant difference in time to full feeds, time to regain birth weight, and duration of hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Intermittent feeding may be more beneficial for low-birth weight infants, However, well-designed studies and evidenced-based clinical practice are required to determine the most appropriate feeding method for premature infants with low birth weight.","Wang, Yan; Zhu, Wei; Luo, Bi-ru",Eur J Clin Nutr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222868/,264
11127,Comparable Effect of Two-Step Versus Extended Infusions on the Pharmacokinetics of Imipenem in Patients with Sepsis and Septic Shock,2020-04-10,"PURPOSE: Biotechnological substances (BSs) are strongly relied upon to prevent rejection of transplanted organs, and to treat oncological, allergological, and other inflammatory diseases. Allergic reactions to partly foreign biologics can occur due to their potential immunogenicity. The severity of an immune response to a biological drug may range from no clinical significance to a severe, life-threatening anaphylactic reaction. METHODS: Detailed searches were performed on Pubmed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to include all available publications. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency, and British Columbia Cancer Agency Drug Manual databases were screened for hypersensitivity reaction (HSR), infusion reaction, injection site reaction, urticaria, and anaphylaxis for individual BSs. RESULTS: Treatment with BSs can cause various types of HSR. These are mentioned in the literature with definitions such as allergic reactions, anaphylactoid reactions, anaphylaxis, HSR, infusion reactions, injection site reactions, cytokine release syndrome, and urticaria. Due to the overlap in signs and symptoms in the reported descriptions, it is not always possible to differentiate these reactions properly according to their pathomechanism. Similarly, many data reported as anaphylaxis actually describe severe anaphylactic reactions (grades III or IV). CONCLUSION: There is an urgent need for a simpler symptom- or system-based classification and scoring system to create an awareness for HSRs to BSs. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of HSRs and increased clinical experience in the treatment of side effects will provide timely control of unexpected reactions. As a result, immunotherapy with BSs will become safer in the future.","Gülsen, Askin; Wedi, Bettina; Jappe, Uta",Allergo J Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223134/,264

In this study, we evaluated the association between early tracheostomy and outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients with GBS. METHODS: This retrospective observational study included adult patients with GBS identified in the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination national inpatient database from July 1, 2010, to March 31, 2018, who initiated MV within the first week of admission and who received MV for more than 1 week. Early tracheostomy was defined as tracheostomy performed within 7 days of MV. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and the secondary outcomes were 28-day mortality, nosocomial pneumonia, length of hospital stay, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, duration of MV, duration of sedation, duration of analgesia, duration of delirium, and total hospitalization costs. Propensity scores for early tracheostomy were calculated using a logistic regression model on the following variables: age; sex; body mass index; Japan Coma Scale status at admission; Charlson comorbidity index score; comorbidity of chronic pulmonary disease; complication of pneumonia at admission; complication of hyponatremia at admission; neurological presentation at admission; ambulance use; referral from other hospitals; treatment year; days from hospital admission to MV initiation; ICU admission until the day of MV initiation; and treatments until the day of MV initiation. Stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting analyses was performed to compare the outcomes between patients with and without early tracheostomy. RESULTS: Among 919 eligible patients, 654 patients (71%) underwent tracheostomy, with 136 patients (15%) receiving early tracheostomy. Overall, the median time from initiation of MV to tracheostomy was 12 days (interquartile range 8–15 days). After stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting, early tracheostomy was not associated with lower in-hospital mortality (risk difference 0.4%; 95% confidence interval − 5.6 to 6.7%) compared with patients without early tracheostomy. There were no significant differences in 28-day mortality (risk difference − 1.3%; 95% confidence interval − 3.5 to 0.9%) and incidence of nosocomial pneumonia (risk difference − 2.6%; 95% confidence interval − 9.1 to 4.2%) between the two groups. None of the other secondary outcomes differed significantly between the groups.

11623,Vertical transmission of COVID-19: SARS-CoV-2 RNA on the fetal side of the placenta in pregnancies with COVID-19 positive mothers and neonates at birth,2020-05-18,"The circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) of various subtypes (e.g., H5N1, H5N6, H5N8, and H7N9) in poultry remains a global concern for animal and public health. Migratory waterfowls play important roles in the transmission of these viruses across countries. To monitor virus spread by wild birds, active surveillance for avian influenza in migratory waterfowl was conducted in Mongolia from 2015 to 2019. In total, 5000 fecal samples were collected from lakesides in central Mongolia, and 167 influenza A viruses were isolated. Two H5N3, four H7N3, and two H7N7 viruses were characterized in this study. The amino acid sequence at hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site of those isolates suggested low pathogenicity in chickens. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all H5 and H7 viruses were closely related to recent H5 and H7 low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs) isolated from wild birds in Asia and Europe. Antigenicity of H7Nx was similar to those of typical non-pathogenic avian influenza viruses (AIVs). While HPAIVs or A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9)-related LPAIVs were not detected in migratory waterfowl in Mongolia, sporadic introductions of AIVs including H5 and H7 viruses into Mongolia through the wild bird migration were identified. Thus, continued monitoring of H5 and H7 AIVs in both domestic and wild birds is needed for the early detection of HPAIVs spread into the country.

12785,Editorial on the consensus statement on diabetic retinopathy care pathway,2020-06-05,"Various lipids and lipid metabolites are bound to and modify the proteins in eukaryotic cells, which are known as ‘protein lipidation’. There are four major types of the protein lipidation, i.e. myristoylation, palmitoylation, prenylation, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. N-myristoylation refers to the attachment of 14-carbon fatty acid myristates to the N-terminal glycine of proteins by N-myristoyltransferases (NMT) and affects their physiology such as plasma targeting, subcellular tracking and localization, thereby influencing the function of proteins. With more novel pathogenic N-myristoylated proteins are identified, the N-myristoylation will attract great attentions in various human diseases including infectious diseases, parasitic diseases, and cancers. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of N-myristoylation in physiological processes and discuss the hitherto implication of crosstalk between N-myristoylation and other protein modification. Furthermore, we mention several well-studied NMT inhibitors mainly in infectious diseases and cancers and generalize the relation of NMT and cancer progression by browsing the clinic database. This review also aims to highlight the further investigation into the dynamic crosstalk of N-myristoylation in physiological processes as well as the potential application of protein N-myristoylation in translational medicine.","Yuan, Meng; Song, Zi-han; Ying, Mei-dan; Zhu, Hong; He, Qiao-jun; Yang, Bo; Cao, Ji",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7468318/,264
13409,Feasibility and safety of bedside percutaneous biliary drainage in patients with severe cholangitis,2020-10-23,"Many patients with wet age-related macular degeneration do not respond well to anti- vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) therapy for choroidal neovascularization (CNV), and the efficacy of anti-VEGFA decreases over time. We investigated the hypothesis that fibrotic changes, in particular via endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT), play a role in CNV and alter the therapeutic effects of VEGFA pathway blockage. Induction of EndoMT of primary human retinal endothelial cells led to a significantly reduced response to VEGFA at the level of gene expression, cellular proliferation, migration, and tube formation. Suppression of EndoMT restored cell responsiveness to VEGFA. In a mouse model of spontaneous CNV, fibrotic changes and EndoMT persisted as the CNV lesions became more established over time. VEGFA receptor-2 (VEGFR2) antagonism further induced fibrosis and EndoMT in the CNV. The combination of VEGFR2 antagonism and fibrosis/EndoMT inhibition was more effective than either individual treatment in reducing CNV. Our data indicate that fibrosis and EndoMT are involved in the progression of CNV, are exacerbated by VEGFR2 inhibition, and could provide an explanation for the reduced efficacy of anti-VEGFA treatment over time.","Rossato, Franco Aparecido; Su, Yu; Mackey, Ashley; Ng, Yin Shan Eric",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7563259/,264

A 2-year, 11-month-old female, captive Asian elephant presented with facial edema and a mild fever. Blood samples were collected and showed EEHV1A positivity with a high viral load by real time PCR. Heterophil toxicity also was reported for the first time in this case. The calf was treated orally with acyclovir, 45 mg/kg tid for 28 days, which reduced the EEHV1A viral load to undetectable levels within 9 days and the calf survived. A successful outcome with oral acyclovir administration provides another and affordable option to treat EEHV hemorrhagic disease in Asian elephants, and one that is easier to administer in untrained calves.","KHAMMESRI, Siripat; MATHURA, Yaoprapa; BOONPRASERT, Khajohnpat; AMPASAVATE, Chadarat; HONGWISET, Darunee; BROWN, Janine L; THITARAM, Chatchote",J Vet Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7870404/,264

The use of additional vascular access devices such as peripherally inserted central catheters to treat such infections should be minimized in patients with ESRD requiring IHD in order to mitigate complications such as infection and thrombosis and to maintain venous patency for hemodialysis access. Intravenous antimicrobial dosing following IHD has the advantages of avoiding additional access devices and providing convenience for patients and providers. Vancomycin, cefazolin, and aminoglycosides have historically been regarded as the primary intravenous antimicrobials administered with IHD given their relatively low cost, convenient dosing, and longevity of clinical use. Despite this, a growing body of literature is evaluating the use of an expanded list of antimicrobials that may be employed using post-dialysis dosing for patients requiring IHD; however, the available data are largely limited to pharmacokinetic studies and small cohorts of infected patients or uninfected subjects. Post-dialytic dosing of intravenous antimicrobials may be considered on a patient-by-patient basis after careful consideration of clinical, microbiological, and logistical factors that may influence the probability of treatment success. This document reviews and evaluates currently available information on the post-dialytic administration of an expanded list of intravenous antimicrobials in the setting of thrice-weekly, high-flux IHD.","Cimino, Christo; Burnett, Yvonne; Vyas, Nikunj; Norris, Anne H.",Drugs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7884963/,264

We evaluated whether modifiable lifestyle factors including educational attainment, smoking, and body mass index are causal risk factors for ischemic stroke and its subtypes and hemorrhagic stroke. METHODS: We performed 2-sample and multivariable Mendelian randomization to assess the causal effect of 12 lifestyle factors on risk of stroke and whether these effects are independent. RESULTS: Genetically predicted years of education was inversely associated with ischemic, large artery, and small vessel stroke, and intracerebral hemorrhage. Genetically predicted smoking, body mass index, and waist-hip ratio were associated with ischemic and large artery stroke. The effects of education, body mass index, and smoking on ischemic stroke were independent. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the hypothesis that reduced education and increased smoking and obesity increase risk of ischemic, large artery, and small vessel stroke, suggesting that lifestyle modifications addressing these risk factors will reduce stroke risk.","Harshfield, Eric L.; Georgakis, Marios K.; Malik, Rainer; Dichgans, Martin; Markus, Hugh S.",Stroke,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7903981/,264

By inhibiting the P-glycoprotein or cytochrome P450 3A in mice host or parasites in a murine model, we aimed at increasing the sensitivity of S. mansoni to the drug and thus preventing infection. We assigned 124 BALB/c mice to no treatment, treatment with ivermectin only or a combination of ivermectin with either cobicistat or elacridar once daily for three days before infecting them with 150 S. mansoni cercariae each. The assignment was done by batches without an explicit randomization code. Toxicity was monitored. At eight weeks post-infection, mice were euthanized. We determined number of eggs in intestine and liver, adult worms in portal and mesenteric veins. Disease was assessed by counting granulomas/cm(2) of liver and studying organ weight indices and total weight. IgG levels in serum were also considered. No difference between groups treated with ivermectin only or in combination with cobicistat or elacridar compared with untreated, infected controls. Most mice treated with ivermectin and elacridar suffered severe neurological toxicity. In conclusion, systemic treatment with ivermectin, even in the presence of pharmacological inhibition of P-glycoprotein or cytochrome P450 3A, did not result in effective prophylaxis for S. mansoni infection in an experimental murine model.","Vicente, Belén; López-Abán, Julio; Chaccour, Juliane; Hernández-Goenaga, Juan; Nicolas, Patricia; Fernández-Soto, Pedro; Muro, Antonio; Chaccour, Carlos",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7904857/,264
15791,Role of Cachexia and Fragility in the Patient Candidate for Cardiac Surgery,2021-02-05,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Sport training is known to induce changes in blood parameters due to the acute physical effort. However, only a few studies have been carried out on the effects of long-term exercise on blood parameters. The Thoroughbred racehorse is a valid animal model to investigate such changes. Twenty-nine clinically healthy 2-year-old Thoroughbred racehorses were followed during their first 4 months of sprint training. Blood was collected at rest, once a month, five times during the sprint training period. In each sample, complete blood count, clotting factors and thrombin–antithrombin complexes were measured. The sprint training period induced significant modifications over time of numerous hematological and clotting parameters compared to pre-training levels. The first long-term training induces fundamental hematological and blood clotting changes in untrained Thoroughbreds, most likely as a result of the physiologic adaptation to training. ABSTRACT: Training has a strong effect on the physiology of hematological parameters and blood coagulation, both in humans and in horses. Several blood changes have been reported after exercise in horses but available data differ. We aimed to investigate modifications in complete blood count and some hemostatic parameters induced by the first training period in young untrained Thoroughbred racehorses to detect a possible labile blood coagulability in racehorses. Twenty-nine untrained 2-year-old Thoroughbreds were followed during their incremental 4-month sprint exercise schedule. Blood collection was performed once a month, five times (T-30, T0, T30, T60 and T90), before and during the training period for measurement of complete blood count (CBC) and blood clotting parameters (prothrombin time—PT, activated partial prothrombin time—APTT, thrombin clotting time—TCT, fibrinogen—Fb, thrombin–antithrombin complex—TAT). Differences among the time points for each parameter were analyzed (ANOVA, Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance, p < 0.05). In Thoroughbreds, the first long-term exercise workout period was found to induce a statistical increase in red blood cell indexes and lymphocytes, eosinophils and platelet counts, as well as a hypercoagulability state evident at 30 days of training, which returned to basal levels after 90 days. Regular physical exercise seems to blunt the negative effects of acute efforts on hematological and clotting parameters, an effect that may be attributed to the training condition.","Miglio, Arianna; Falcinelli, Emanuela; Mezzasoma, Anna Maria; Cappelli, Katia; Mecocci, Samanta; Gresele, Paolo; Antognoni, Maria Teresa",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7915801/,264
16010,Role of functional echocardiographic parameters in the diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia-associated pulmonary hypertension,2021-03-08,"BACKGROUND: In Canada, 30%-60% of patients presenting to emergency departments are ambulatory. This category has been labeled as a source of emergency department overuse. Acting on the presumption that primary care practices and walk-in clinics offer equivalent care at a lower cost, governments have invested massively in improving access to these alternative settings in the hope that patients would present there instead when possible, thereby reducing the load on emergency departments. Data in support of this approach remain scarce and equivocal. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to compare the value of care received in emergency departments, walk-in clinics, and primary care practices by ambulatory patients with upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, otitis media, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, bronchitis, influenza-like illness, pneumonia, acute asthma, or acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. METHODS: A multicenter prospective cohort study will be performed in Ontario and Québec. In phase 1, a time-driven activity-based costing method will be applied at each of the 15 study sites. This method uses time as a cost driver to allocate direct costs (eg, medication), consumable expenditures (eg, needles), overhead costs (eg, building maintenance), and physician charges to patient care. Thus, the cost of a care episode will be proportional to the time spent receiving the care. At the end of this phase, a list of care process costs will be generated and used to calculate the cost of each consultation during phase 2, in which a prospective cohort of patients will be monitored to compare the care received in each setting. Patients aged 18 years and older, ambulatory throughout the care episode, and discharged to home with one of the aforementioned targeted diagnoses will be considered. The estimated sample size is 1485 patients. The 3 types of care settings will be compared on the basis of primary outcomes in terms of the proportion of return visits to any site 3 and 7 days after the initial visit and the mean cost of care. The secondary outcomes measured will include scores on patient-reported outcome and experience measures and mean costs borne wholly by patients. We will use multilevel generalized linear models to compare the care settings and an overlap weights approach to adjust for confounding factors related to age, sex, gender, ethnicity, comorbidities, registration with a family physician, socioeconomic status, and severity of illness. RESULTS: Phase 1 will begin in 2021 and phase 2, in 2023. The results will be available in 2025. CONCLUSIONS: The end point of our program will be for deciders, patients, and care providers to be able to determine the most appropriate care setting for the management of ambulatory emergency respiratory conditions, based on the quality and cost of care associated with each alternative.

Validation tests were done for quantitative results using the performance measures for every methodology. The proposed system is found to be successful, achieving results with 87% accuracy, which could reduce human mistakes in the diagnosis process. Moreover, our proposed system achieves accuracy higher than the 78% accuracy of machine learning (ML) algorithms. The proposed system therefore improves accuracy by 9% above results from machine learning (ML) algorithms.","Alanazi, Saad Awadh; Kamruzzaman, M.

How microtubule nucleation and polarity are regulated within neurons remains unclear. We show that γ-tubulin localises asymmetrically to the somatic Golgi within Drosophila neurons. Microtubules originate from the Golgi with an initial growth preference towards the axon. Their growing plus ends also turn towards and into the axon, adding to the plus-end-out microtubule pool. Any plus ends that reach a dendrite, however, do not readily enter, maintaining minus-end-out polarity. Both turning towards the axon and exclusion from dendrites depend on Kinesin-2, a plus-end-associated motor that guides growing plus ends along adjacent microtubules. We propose that Kinesin-2 engages with a polarised microtubule network within the soma to guide growing microtubules towards the axon; while at dendrite entry sites engagement with microtubules of opposite polarity generates a backward stalling force that prevents entry into dendrites and thus maintains minus-end-out polarity within proximal dendrites.","Mukherjee, Amrita; Brooks, Paul S; Bernard, Fred; Guichet, Antoine; Conduit, Paul T",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7394546/,264

Determining the preferred specialty and understanding the compulsion affecting specialty choice will provide clues to influence such choice in the future to shift the balance of specialties among practitioners. The current study aimed to determine medical students' preferable specialty choices and the factors influencing their choices and their attitude towards postgraduate medical education in Jordan and abroad. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The descriptive cross-sectional study design included 6th-year medical students in medical faculties in Jordan. An online questionnaire was created on Google Forms and posted on platforms accessible by medical students at level six. Numbers and percentages were presented for all variables. Frequency distributions were also presented. Chi-square distribution was used to measure the association between categorical data. Alpha level of 0.05 was used. RESULTS: Most students 188 (74.3%) preferred to continue their post-graduate training abroad, while only 65 (25.7%) favored Jordan. 150 (59.3%) of the respondents are interested in the medical – non-surgical - specialties. The most important factor that encouraged the students to choose a specialty was Job opportunity (32.5%) followed by the number of years required to complete the training and the expected income (27.7%) each. CONCLUSION: Supportive steps should be undertaken to motivate medical graduates toward the needed specialties. Moreover, local Specialty training programs need to be –reevaluated to ensure proper post graduate medical learning.","Al-beitawi, Soha Nafez; Al-Shatanawi, Tariq N.; Qudsieh, Suhair Adel; Abu Marar, Ehab Ibrahim; Al Zoubi, Mazhar Salim; Al-zubi, Mohammad",Ann Med Surg (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8141496/,264

There is a paucity of data describing the intracellular transport of IgG in the context of endosomal-lysosomal alterations linked to trisomy 21. In this study, we analyzed the intracellular traffic of IgG mediated by the human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) in fibroblast cell lines with trisomy 21. Intracellular IgG trafficking studies in live cells showed that fibroblasts with trisomy 21 exhibit higher proportion of IgG in lysosomes (~ 10% increase), decreased IgG content in intracellular vesicles (~ 9% decrease), and a trend towards decreased IgG recycling (~ 55% decrease) in comparison to diploid cells. Amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) overexpression in diploid fibroblasts replicated the increase in IgG sorting to the degradative pathway observed in cells with trisomy 21. The impact of APP on the expression of FCGRT (alpha chain component of FcRn) was investigated by APP knock down and overexpression of the APP protein. APP knock down increased the expression of FCGRT mRNA by ~ 60% in both diploid and trisomic cells. Overexpression of APP in diploid fibroblasts and HepG2 cells resulted in a decrease in FCGRT and FcRn expression. Our results indicate that the intracellular traffic of IgG is altered in cells with trisomy 21.

The mean and median hardness of tap water in Japan was 48.9 ± 25.8 (1σ SD) and 46.0 mg/L, respectively. Compared with 27 other countries, Japan exhibited soft water with low-mineral content. Water hardness tended to be high in the Kanto region and low in the Hokkaido and Tohoku regions. The impact of the distribution system’s water pipes on tap water hardness is discussed using a unified index to evaluate variations in hardness from raw to tap water. A comparison of the variations in hardness showed that hardness variations from raw to purified water and from purified to tap water exhibited a 20% variation range. Furthermore, tap water hardness and its fluctuations in any region of Japan were found to be caused by raw water hardness. It was demonstrated that the distribution pipe system had no large impacts on water hardness.","Hori, Mayumi; Shozugawa, Katsumi; Sugimori, Kenji; Watanabe, Yuichiro",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8242065/,264

19468,Sevelamer carbonate increases serum bicarbonate in pediatric dialysis patients,2010-02-01,"BACKGROUND: Phenotypes characterize the clinical manifestations of diseases and provide important information for diagnosis. Therefore, the construction of phenotype knowledge graphs for diseases is valuable to the development of artificial intelligence in medicine. However, phenotype knowledge graphs in current knowledge bases such as WikiData and DBpedia are coarse-grained knowledge graphs because they only consider the core concepts of phenotypes while neglecting the details (attributes) associated with these phenotypes. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the details of disease phenotypes for clinical guidelines, we proposed a fine-grained semantic information model named PhenoSSU (semantic structured unit of phenotypes). METHODS: PhenoSSU is an “entity-attribute-value” model by its very nature, and it aims to capture the full semantic information underlying phenotype descriptions with a series of attributes and values. A total of 193 clinical guidelines for infectious diseases from Wikipedia were selected as the study corpus, and 12 attributes from SNOMED-CT were introduced into the PhenoSSU model based on the co-occurrences of phenotype concepts and attribute values. The expressive power of the PhenoSSU model was evaluated by analyzing whether PhenoSSU instances could capture the full semantics underlying the descriptions of the corresponding phenotypes. To automatically construct fine-grained phenotype knowledge graphs, a hybrid strategy that first recognized phenotype concepts with the MetaMap tool and then predicted the attribute values of phenotypes with machine learning classifiers was developed. RESULTS: Fine-grained phenotype knowledge graphs of 193 infectious diseases were manually constructed with the BRAT annotation tool. A total of 4020 PhenoSSU instances were annotated in these knowledge graphs, and 3757 of them (89.5%) were found to be able to capture the full semantics underlying the descriptions of the corresponding phenotypes listed in clinical guidelines. By comparison, other information models, such as the clinical element model and the HL7 fast health care interoperability resource model, could only capture the full semantics underlying 48.4% (2034/4020) and 21.8% (914/4020) of the descriptions of phenotypes listed in clinical guidelines, respectively. The hybrid strategy achieved an F1-score of 0.732 for the subtask of phenotype concept recognition and an average weighted accuracy of 0.776 for the subtask of attribute value prediction. CONCLUSIONS: PhenoSSU is an effective information model for the precise representation of phenotype knowledge for clinical guidelines, and machine learning can be used to improve the efficiency of constructing PhenoSSU-based knowledge graphs. Our work will potentially shift the focus of medical knowledge engineering from a coarse-grained level to a more fine-grained level.","Deng, Lizong; Chen, Luming; Yang, Tao; Liu, Mi; Li, Shicheng; Jiang, Taijiao",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8277235/,264

OBJECTIVE: To describe the long-term outcome of functional independence and quality of life (QoL) for individuals with traumatic and ischemic SCI beyond the first year after injury. SETTING: A multicenter study in Germany. METHODS: Participants of the European multicenter study about spinal cord injury (EMSCI) of three German SCI centers were included and followed over time by the German spinal cord injury cohort study (GerSCI). Individuals’ most recent spinal cord independence measure (SCIM) scores assessed by a clinician were followed up by a self-report (SCIM-SR) and correlated to selected items of the WHO short survey of quality of life (WHO-QoL-BREF). RESULTS: Data for 359 individuals were obtained. The average time passed the last clinical SCIM examination was 81.47 (SD 51.70) months. In total, 187 of the 359 received questionnaires contained a completely evaluable SCIM-SR. SCIM scores remained stable with the exception of reported management of bladder and bowel resulting in a slight decrease of SCIM-SR of −2.45 points (SD 16.81). SCIM-SR scores showed a significant correlation with the selected items of the WHO-QoL-BREF (p < 0.01) with moderate to strong influence. CONCLUSION: SCIM score stability over time suggests a successful transfer of acquired independence skills obtained during primary rehabilitation into the community setting paralleled by positively related QoL measurements but bladder and bowel management may need special attention.","Möller, Florian; Rupp, Rüdiger; Weidner, Norbert; Gutenbrunner, Christoph; Kalke, Yorck B.; Abel, Rainer F.",Spinal Cord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8338549/,264

PEP is a tauopathy with multisystem neuronal loss and gliosis, clinically characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, rest tremor, and oculogyric crises. Though a viral cause of EL is likely, past polymerase chain reaction-based investigations in the etiology of both PEP and EL were negative. PEP might be caused directly by an unknown viral pathogen or the consequence of a post-infectious immunopathology. The development of metagenomic next-generation sequencing in conjunction with bioinformatic techniques has generated a broad-range tool for the detection of unknown pathogens in the recent past. Retrospective identification and characterization of pathogens responsible for past infectious diseases can be successfully performed with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples. In this study, we analyzed 24 FFPE brain samples from six patients with PEP by unbiased metagenomic next-generation sequencing. Our results show that no evidence for the presence of a specific or putative (novel) viral pathogen was found, suggesting a likely post-infectious immune-mediated etiology of PEP.","Cadar, Dániel; Jellinger, Kurt A.; Riederer, Peter; Strobel, Sabrina; Monoranu, Camelia-Maria; Tappe, Dennis",Microorganisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8398509/,264
20505,Dendritic Cells and Antiphospholipid Syndrome: An Updated Systematic Review,2021-08-09,"Emotional eating is one factor that increases the consumption of unhealthy food. This study aimed to investigate the association between emotional eating and frequencies of consuming fast food, high-fat snacks, processed meat products, dessert foods, and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) in adolescents. The baseline survey data (2015) from the Taiwan Adolescent to Adult Longitudinal Study (TAALS) were fitted into multivariate logistic regression models adjusted for sex, school type, Body Mass Index (BMI), eating while doing something, nutrition label reading, skipping breakfast, smoking, binge drinking, sedentary lifestyle, physical activity, peer and school support, and parental education level. Among the 18,461 participants (48.5% male and 51.5% female), those exhibiting emotional eating were more likely to consume fast food (Odds ratio (OR) = 2.40, 95% Confidence interval (CI): 2.18–2.64), high-fat snacks (OR = 2.30, 95% CI: 2.12–2.49), processed meat products (OR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.78–2.08), dessert foods (OR = 2.49, 95% CI: 2.31–2.69), and sugar-sweetened beverages (OR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.70–1.98). Factors that were positively associated with unhealthy food consumption included eating while doing other activities, binge drinking, smoking, and sedentary lifestyle. Among all the covariates, nutrition label reading was the only factor that was inversely associated with frequent unhealthy food consumption. Sex and school type may moderate the effect of emotional eating on the frequent consumption of specific unhealthy food groups. In conclusion, adolescents with high emotional eating were more likely to report frequent consumption of unhealthy foods in Taiwan. Our findings showed that male participants appeared to consume fast foods, high-fat snacks, processed meat, and SSBs more often and dessert foods less often than females. Future longitudinal studies are recommended for understanding the causal relationship between emotional eating and unhealthy food consumption.","Bui, Chung; Lin, Li-Yin; Wu, Chih-Yi; Chiu, Ya-Wen; Chiou, Hung-Yi",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8401002/,264

DESIGN: Mixed-method exploratory design. SETTING: Professionals and the general public. PARTICIPANTS: A short online survey with 239 professionals. Interaction and user sentiment towards with the film on social media (Twitter, YouTube). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Survey: participants’ attitudes towards the film including feelings invoked, learning gained and ACE count prevalence. Twitter user and YouTube viewer sentiment (positive, negative or neutral) and interaction (likes, retweets or comments) with the film. RESULTS: Attitudes to the film were positive: 94.1% and 93.7%, respectively, agreed that it provided a helpful explanation of ACEs and trusted that the film was credible. Of those who reported ACE exposure, 88.9% agreed that those with ACEs would benefit from watching the film. Despite 50.6% reporting that the film had made them feel sad or upset, the majority (66.4%) reported they found the film hopeful or encouraging. Across 358 publicly available tweets from 313 users, 39.1% of tweets expressed positive sentiment, with only 1.4% negative (59.5% neutral). However, there was no association between tweet sentiment and interaction. Thirteen YouTube versions of the film received 171 812 views, 97.3% (n=889/914) ratings were positive (ie, ‘thumbs up’). CONCLUSIONS: Despite being emotionally arousing, many professionals reflected positive impacts of the film including a perceived increased ability to discuss ACEs. Public sentiment demonstrated a positive reaction to and acceptability of the film. Understanding the professional and public response to materials developed to increase ACE awareness, such as the film explored here, is important given the growing number of international movements which seek to increase ACE awareness, prevent ACEs and mitigate their lifelong negative effects.","Ford, Kat; Bellis, Mark A; Isherwood, Kate R; Hughes, Karen E",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8372873/,264

29064,Disseminated intravascular coagulation: Present and future perspective,1995,"Egg and embryo development ofCorydendrium parasiticum (L.) (Hydroida, Athecata) has been examined with special regard to ultrastructural changes of the oocytes during vitellogenesis. It has been established that ectodermal interstitial cells migrate through the mesolamella into the endoderm and differentiate there to germ cells. Despite differences in the origin of the interstitial cells during early development there is still justification to speak of ectodermal descent of hydroid germ cells. The gonophores are equivalent to hydranth buds. By early immigration, oocytes determine the development of buds into gonophores. After completion of vitellogenesis and rupture of the follicle epithelium eggs undergo meiosis. The total and equal segmentation starts already during spawning. After forming a solid morula, gastrulation takes place as moruladelamination. Interstitial cells and cnidoblasts are formed in the prospective endoderm and migrate early into the ectoderm. A polar differentiation becomes evident shortly before hatching of the planula. The planulae keep their solid endoderm until their transformation into primary polyps. Metamorphosis can occur after one day. The delayed beginning of metamorphosis up to 12 days under lab conditions is probably due to the absence of certain bacteria. According to developmental stages of the oocytes ultrastructural changes during vitellogenesis are described. The endproducts of vitellogenesis are heterogeneous yolk (“Komplexdotter”), lipid droplets and glycogen. The “Komplexdotter” represents the bulk of reserve material which is formed by several components of different origin. Of special interest in this respect are the cytosomes resembling the microbodies of liver and kidney because of their paracristalline core and close relationship to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Comparable cores exist in the “Komplexdotter” which may correspond to enzymes histochemically identified in the yolk of other species.","Glätzer, K.

31691,Cutaneous Manifestations of Infectious Diseases,2011-09-28,"This chapter discusses the classification and pathogenicity of microbes. The microbial causes of human disease include viruses, chlamydiae, rickettsiae, mycoplasmas, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. Viruses differ greatly from all the other microbes as they consist essentially of only nucleic acid surrounded by a protein coat and contain only one instead of two types of nucleic acid. Once inside human cells, the viruses remove the normal nuclear control of the cells to take over cellular metabolism for the synthesis of new virions. Chlamydiae and rickettsiae are also obligate intracellular parasites, have both DNA and RNA, and multiply by binary fission. Mycoplasmas, bacteria, and fungi can be cultured in cell-free media. Bacterial causes of disease are mainly lower bacteria that are unicellular. Multiplication is predominantly by asexual binary fission, although biological variation is facilitated in some species by sex, especially with Gram-negative species such as Escherichia coli. Only a few higher bacteria cause disease in man, such as Actinomycetes israelit, which are filamentous Gram-positive bacilli.","Shanson, D.C.",Microbiology in Clinical Practice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173597/,264
34473,Green endoscopy: a call for sustainability in the midst of COVID-19,2020-06-15,"BACKGROUND: Leishmaniasis is a notifiable disease in Sri Lanka since 2008. Previous studies show a gap in the notification of leishmaniasis. The purpose of the present study was to determine the Knowledge, attitudes and practice of medical officers regarding leishmaniasis. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Anuradhapura district which reported the highest case load of leishmaniasis. Medical officers from public and private health care institutes in the area filled a self-administered questionnaire in the presence of the investigators. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-eight (188) medical officers completed the questionnaire. Of them, 95.7% were aware of leishmaniasis as a parasitic infection and 84.7% correctly identified Leishmania donovani as the causative organism in Sri Lanka. From the respondents, 181 (96.8%) knew that the vector of leishmaniasis is sand fly. Cutaneous leishmaniasis was reported as the most prevalent form of leishmaniasis in the country by 176 (94.1%). Nearly half of the respondents (98, 54.1%) were aware of the fact that the Anuradhapura district has the highest disease burden. Many of them had the idea that leishmaniasis is an emerging disease (155, 84.3%,) and early diagnosis is important in controlling the disease (163, 89.1%). Although about three fourth (123, 73.7%,) of the participants mentioned that leishmaniasis should be notified at first clinical suspicion, only 74 (42.5%) were aware that it is a legal requirement. Some medical officers (39, 22%) believed that the current notification system in the country is not effective. Unavailability of notification forms (60, 36.8%) heavy workload (85, 50.3%) and inadequate supportive staff (55, 35.1%) were reported as barriers for timely notification. Even though 105 (58.0%) of medical officers had suspected leishmaniasis during the last 8 years period only 35 (19.4%) had notified. CONCLUSIONS: Even though more than 90% of the participants had good theoretical knowledge about leishmaniasis; notification of leishmaniasis is considerably inadequate. This study emphasizes the need for greater efforts to improve the notification of leishmaniasis in Sri Lanka.","Hewawasam, Chandana; Weerakoon, Hema S.; Thilakan, Vyshnavi; Lelwala, Tishni; Prasanka, Kalana; Rathnayaka, A.

In this paper, we present a novel bio-inspired hybrid parallel optimization algorithm (Cuckoo-Firefly-GR), which combines Genetic Replacement (GR) of low fitness individuals with a hybrid of Cuckoo Search (CS) and Firefly (FA) optimizations. Cuckoo-Firefly-GR not only employs the random walk in CS, but also uses mechanisms in FA to generate and select fitter individuals. The content- and behavior-based features of emails used in the existing works, along with Doc2Vec features of the email body are employed to extract the syntactic and semantic information in the emails. By establishing an optimal balance between intensification and diversification, and reaching global optimization using two metaheuristics, we argue that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the performance of UBE detection, by selecting the most discriminative feature subspace. This study presents significant observations from the extensive evaluations on UBE corpora of 3, 844 emails, that underline the efficiency and superiority of our proposed Cuckoo-Firefly-GR over the base optimizations (Cuckoo-GR and Firefly-GR), dense autoencoders, recurrent neural autoencoders, and several state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the instructive feature subset obtained using the proposed Cuckoo-Firefly-GR, when classified using a dense neural model, achieved an accuracy of [Formula: see text].","Gangavarapu, Tushaar; Jaidhar, C.

The Lifelong Learning Institute (LLI) at Nova Southeastern University (NSU) in South Florida has worked to engage seniors in fun learning activities and social opportunities since 1977. When “stay at home” orders went into effect in March, 2020 the LLI moved to online program delivery via Zoom. To understand the implementation of zoom among LLI members, NSU students, researchers and LLI member advisory committee developed a cross-sectional research study using an online survey that was administered to LLI members three months post-zoom implementation in May, 2020. Results among the 127 responders demonstrated that a majority of members were not comfortable using zoom (57%) especially the chat, reactions or camera features. More than 80% of responders did report that zoom helped them keep their spirits up. Respondents had specific feedback to improve Zoom programming including Youtube videos on use, retraining, training on features (e.g. chat, camera, reaction), closed captioning, program reminders and links sent out more frequently and within 30 minutes of start time. There were also several comments about internet connectivity, identifying opportunities for router and internet plan education. Finally, respondents noted new opportunities to enhance virtual programming including engaging speakers from across the nation and world. In summary, direct feedback from seniors on how to improve the online social and learning environment is pivotal to improving experience, programming and social connection during COVID-19.","Derynda, Brittany; Goodyear, Mary; Kushner, Jade; Cook, Nicole",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7741557/,264

For decades, the weakness of communicative and collaborative links between the university and K-12 system has been one of the most significant barriers to effective preparation of new teachers identified by researchers and policy makers. Historical obstacles, such as disconnects between coursework and field work, divides between professional knowledge and skilled practice, and competing goals and priorities between organizations continue to plague the work of teacher preparation. The problem of the university-school divide in teacher education is further surfaced by scholarship that points to benefits of embedding teacher preparation in the K-12 setting and burgeoning research that suggests clinical practice is central to high-quality teacher preparation. This paper presents a case study investigating the organizational contexts of the university-school relationship in a teacher education program and draws on third-generation activity theory and activity system analysis to explore the evolving partnership institutionally, culturally, and historically. Findings reveal that transactional relationships between system elements shape collaborative activities and partnerships and show multilevel contradictions within and across collective activities, suggesting potential for expansive development.","Krichevsky, Boris",Hu Arenas,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8089127/,264

Therefore, they need support to participate in physical activities, and it is crucial to work with primary caregivers when developing appropriate strategies, thereby leading to an active lifestyle. There is limited evidence supporting the effectiveness of remotely supported physical activity interventions. This project aimed to evaluate the effects of a skype-based, telehealth-delivered physical activity program carried out by participants’ parents at home. This article will focus on parental points of view. A mixed-methods design evaluating parental satisfaction was conducted. Forty participants with a confirmed genetic diagnosis of RTT and their families were recruited. The intervention included a 12-week individualized daily physical activity program carried out by participants’ parents and bi-weekly supervised by expert therapists. Parents’ impressions and feelings related to the program implementation were collected throughout semi-structured interviews, and an ad hoc developed questionnaire and discussed. The current project results suggest that a remote physical rehabilitation program, supported fortnightly by video calls, represents an effective way of conducting a remote physical therapy intervention for this population and that it can be easily carried out at home by primary caregivers, promoting positive functional changes, without bringing feelings of frustration due to the required workload. The strategies that families have learned during the program to support the motor activities of their daughters represent an easily performed set of tools that they can maintain and use in everyday life even after the cessation of the program.","Lotan, Meir; Ippolito, Elena; Favetta, Martina; Romano, Alberto",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8481588/,264

Public Health is defined as “the art and science of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through the organized efforts of society” (Acheson, 1988; WHO). The COVID 19 pandemic has brought a focus on the concept of public health more than ever. Independent departments of Public Health do not exist at medical colleges in India. Public health is a multidisciplinary domain. The body of knowledge is cross-cutting and multidimensional in nature. Public health education is optimal only with the contribution of the participating faculty from different educational and professional backgrounds. Lack of strong public health academics may adversely impact the capacity to formulate indigenous public health policy. In many parts of the developing world, public health policies are heavily influenced by the knowledge developed by the western universities within the domain of global health. Global health policies and goals become synonymous with national health goals. For the democratic republic of India, there is an urgent need to strengthen the public health education system so that the future challenges of health, safety, economy, security can be met The National Medical Commission (NMC) has invited comments on the draft postgraduate medical education regulations 2021.

In addition to analyzing the work, we investigate its relevance for science education. After the US attack on two Japanese cities with atomic bombs, there was a severance of opinions on nuclear technologies. On one side, it had an association with the destruction arising from the war. On the other, a narrative highlighted the advantages of using nuclear power for developments that would benefit humanity. Haber and Disney’s book aim to explain how such power works and supports its use for the good, despite the danger of destruction. Our goal is to contextualize the book’s content and its visual imagery and identify aspects to contribute to the science curriculum. We summarized the historical elements of the post-war period and Walt Disney’s entertainment approach and political stance. We discuss how it made a dialogue between a scientific concept and the general public through the book. For the matter of this article, we chose to examine one of the figures in the book, which represents through an illustration how chain reactions work to generate atomic power. For such, we followed a four-step methodology proposed by Silva and Neves Em Aberto, 31(103).

For WSIIs, the annual average concentrations were 6.3 ± 3.3, 2.1 ± 1.2, 3.3 ± 1.5, and 1.6 ± 0.8 μg m(−3) in PM(1), PM(1-2.5), PM(2.5–10), and PM(>10), respectively. In addition, pronounced seasonal variations of WSIIs in PM(1) and PM(1-2.5) were observed, with the highest concentration in spring-winter and the lowest in summer. The size distribution showed that SO(4)(2−), NH(4)(+) and K(+) were consistently present in the submicron particles while Ca(2+), Mg(2+), Na(+) and Cl(−) mainly accumulated in the size range of 2.5–10 μm, reflecting their different dominant sources. In spring, fall and winter, a bimodal distribution of NO(3)(−) was observed with one peak at 2.5–10 μm and another peak at 0.44–1 μm. In summer, however, the fine mode peak disappeared, likely due to the unfavorable conditions for the formation of NH(4)NO(3). For NH(4)(+) and SO(4)(2−), their dominant peak at 0.25–0.44 μm in summer and fall shifted to 0.44–1 μm in spring and winter. Although the concentration of NO(3)–N was lower than NH(4)–N, the dry deposition flux of NO(3)–N (35.77 ± 24.49 μmol N m(−2) d(−1)) was much higher than that of NH(4)–N (10.95 ± 11.89 μmol N m(−2) d(−1)), mainly due to the larger deposition velocities of NO(3)–N. The contribution of sea-salt particles to the total particulate inorganic N deposition was estimated to be 23.9—52.8%. Dry deposition of particulate inorganic N accounted for 0.95% of other terrestrial N influxes. The annual total N deposition can create a new productivity of 3.55 mgC m(−2) d(−1), accounting for 1.3–4.7% of the primary productivity in Xiamen Bay. In light of these results, atmospheric N deposition could have a significant influence on biogeochemistry cycle of nutrients with respect to projected increase of anthropogenic emissions from mobile sources in coastal region.

59356,Kounis Syndrome Secondary to Medicine-Induced Hypersensitivity,2021-10-01,"Recent years have seen a rise in research where so called “digital biomarkers” represent the focal study interest. Many researchers understand that digital biomarkers describe digital footprints providing insights into healthy and pathological human (neuro-)biology. Beyond that the term digital biomarker is also used at times to describe more general concepts such as linking digital footprints to human behavior (which itself can be described as the result of a biological system). Given the lack of consensus on how to define a digital biomarker, the present short mini-review provides i) an overview on various definitions and ii) distinguishes between direct (narrow) or indirect (broad) concepts of digital biomarkers. From our perspective, digital biomarkers meant as a more direct (or narrow) concept describe digital footprints being directly linked to biological variables, such as stemming from molecular genetics, epigenetics, endocrinology, immunology or brain imaging, to name a few. More indirect concepts of digital biomarkers encompass digital footprints being linked to human behavior that may act as latent variables indirectly linked to biological variables.","Montag, Christian; Elhai, Jon D.; Dagum, Paul",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8514660/,264

Descriptive analyses and t-tests (by state) were conducted to explore service concerns, access barriers, and organizational capacity to address concerns and barriers. Among most prevalently reported concerns were income/wages and fear of deportation. Key access barriers included language, lack of driver's license and insurance, and fear of deportation. Most (63%) organizations had sufficient Spanish language proficiency, though building trust was a notable barrier within 58% of organizations.

The role of endovascular treatment remains to be clarified in this indication, especially after A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations. Our objective was to assess the safety and efficacy of first-line endovascular treatment in low-grade brain arteriovenous malformation management at our institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with low-grade brain arteriovenous malformations treated primarily with embolization in our department between January 2005 and December 2015 were retrieved from our prospectively collected registry. The primary outcome was the brain arteriovenous malformation obliteration rate, and secondary outcomes were disability or death secondary to brain arteriovenous malformation embolization assessed through modification of the modified Rankin Scale. RESULTS Two hundred twenty-four patients completed endovascular treatment during the study period and represent our study population. Complete exclusion of brain arteriovenous malformations was achieved in 205 patients (92%), including 62.1% of brain arteriovenous malformation exclusions after a single endovascular treatment session. One patient died of a hemorrhagic complication after endovascular treatment, leading to a mortality rate of 0.4%. Twelve patients (5%) kept a permanent neurologic deficit secondary to a complication of the endovascular treatment. An overall good outcome (mRS 0-2) was reported in 179 patients (80%). CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment might be a suitable alternative to surgical resection for complete exclusion of selected low-grade brain arteriovenous malformations.","Baharvahdat, H; Blanc, R; Fahed, R; Smajda, S; Ciccio, G; Desilles, J-P; Redjem, H; Escalard, S; Mazighi, M; Chauvet, D; Robert, T; Sasannejad, P; Piotin, M",AJNR.

61770,Cerebral Oxygenation and Autoregulation in Very Preterm Infants Developing IVH During the Transitional Period: A Pilot Study.,2020,"BACKGROUND End-of-life care has become an important public health issue in recent years. Place of death is a major component of end-of-life care. Despite attempts to improve end-of-life care, there has not been published any data about place of deaths in Turkey. Aim: This retrospective, cross-sectional study investigates the place of death and trends over the years in geriatric age groups in Turkey. Methods: Patients who were admitted to geriatric outpatient clinic of a university hospital during a 7-year period were included. Place and date of death information were received from the death notification system and recorded as hospital or out-of-hospital death. Demographic and clinical data were collected from the hospital information system. Deaths occurring after March 1, 2020 were not included to eliminate the effect of coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic. Results: A total of 4025 (20.7%) patients were determined to be dead. Approximately three-quarters of deaths (73.0%) occurred in hospital. The number of deaths reported from nursing homes was only 13 (3.0%). Patients with dementia less frequently died in hospital, however, it was not statistically significant (12.4% vs 14.7%, P = .05). The prevalence of death in hospital was significantly higher in patients with chronic renal failure (3.1% vs 1.7%, P = .02). The presence of comorbid conditions such as heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma, and cancer did not affect the place of death (P = .24, .21, .24, .51, and .18). Out-of-hospital mortality increased with advanced age (P < .001). No significant difference was found in the place of death over the years (P = .41). Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study examining the place of death in Turkey, an aging country. Our results may help to establish policies about end-of-life care in elderly people to improve quality of life by using resources effectively.","Ceylan, Serdar; Guner Oytun, Merve; Okyar Bas, Arzu; Kahyaoglu, Zeynep; Dogu, Burcu B; Cankurtaran, Mustafa; Halil, Meltem G",Journal of palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1177/08258597211036579; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34402330/,264

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate drug spills prospectively using biological measures and correlate drug spills with organizational factors. METHODS Prospective questionnaires with 8-hour timed urine samples were collected from nursing and pharmacy personnel who reported drug spill events in 1 academic health center's infusion center. Urine was collected similarly from workers who did not report a spill. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry techniques identified detectable drug levels. After the prospective sampling period, workers were surveyed on workloads, practice environment, and safety behaviors. RESULTS From 81 eligible individuals, 40 participated in the prospective study and 19 completed retrospective questionnaires. Four spills were reported by 9 personnel, as multiple employees were exposed to drug spills. Four participants who reported a spill showed detectable levels of antineoplastic drugs. Four participants who did not report a spill had detectable levels of docetaxel. Compared with respondents who did not report a spill, collegial relations with physicians were significantly poorer for workers who reported spills. CONCLUSIONS The study protocol successfully captured drug spill reports and biological samples. Workers have detectable levels of antineoplastic drugs through both drug spills and environmental contamination.

This study investigated the gelation behavior and physical properties of hydrogels formed from homogeneous and blended solutions of two acrylated poloxamines (Tetronics® T1107 and T904) of various molecular weights and hydrophilic/lipophilic balances relative to a PEG control. Hydrogels were formed by reverse thermal gelation at physiological temperature (T1107-containing formulations) and covalent crosslinking by Michael-type addition with dithiothreitol. All poloxamine-based hydrogels exhibited thermosensitive behavior and achieved significantly reduced swelling, increased tensile properties and increased tissue bond strength relative to the PEG hydrogel at physiological temperature. Swelling and tensile properties of all poloxamine-based hydrogels were significantly greater at 37°C relative to 4°C, suggesting that their improved physical properties derive from cooperative crosslinking by both noncovalent and covalent mechanisms. Poloxamine-based hydrogels were cytocompatible and underwent hydrolytic degradation over 2-5weeks, depending on their T1107/T904 composition. In conclusion, select poloxamine-based hydrogels possess a number of properties potentially beneficial to tissue sealant applications, including a substantial increase in viscosity between room/physiological temperatures, resistance to cell adhesion and maintenance of a stable volume during equilibration.","Cho, Eunhee; Lee, Jeoung Soo; Webb, Ken",Acta biomaterialia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2012.03.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22406506/,264

One mechanism that MSCs exert functions is through the transfer of mitochondria, a key player involved in many biological processes in health and disease. Mitochondria transfer is bidirectional and has an impact on both donor and recipient cells. In this review, we discussed how MSC-mediated mitochondrial transfer may affect cellular metabolism, survival, proliferation, and differentiation; how this process influences inflammatory processes; and what is the molecular machinery that mediates mitochondrial transfer. In the end, we summarized recent advances in preclinical research and clinical trials for the treatment of stroke and spinal cord injury, through application of MSCs and/or MSC-derived mitochondria.","Han, Deqiang; Zheng, Xin; Wang, Xueyao; Jin, Tao; Cui, Li; Chen, Zhiguo",Stem cells international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8838046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724315/,264
62751,Cytokine release syndrome in severe COVID-19.,2020-04-17,"The objective of this prospective cohort study was to investigate the effect of bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine rotavirus (BRoV), and Cryptosporidiumparvum on dairy calf health and performance and to determine the prevalence of these pathogens. A total of 198 male dairy calves housed at a grain-fed veal facility were examined from June 11, 2018, to October 9, 2018. Calves were fed milk replacer twice daily and housed individually until weaning at 56 d. Once weaned, calves were moved into groups of 5 until they were moved to a finishing facility at 77 d. At the grain-fed veal facility, calves were scored for fecal consistency for the first 28 d and had fecal samples taken on arrival and at 7 and 14 d. Fecal samples were frozen and submitted to a commercial laboratory, where they were tested for BCoV, C.parvum, and 2 groups of BRoV: group A (BRoV A) and group B (BRoV B). Calves were weighed on arrival and at 14, 49, 56, and 77 d using a digital body scale. Treatments for disease and mortalities that occurred over the 77 d were also recorded. Statistical models, including Cox proportional hazards and repeated measures models, were built to determine the effect of infection with 1 of the pathogens. Over the 3 sampling points, 151 (85.8%), 178 (94.2%), 3 (1.5%), and 97 (57.4%) calves tested positive at least once for BCoV, BRoV A, BRoV B, and C.parvum, respectively. The source of the calves and the level of serum total protein measured on arrival were associated with testing positive for a pathogen. Calves that tested positive for C.parvum had an increased proportion of days with diarrhea and severe diarrhea; calves that tested positive for BCoV and BRoV A had an increased proportion of days with severe diarrhea. In addition, calves that tested positive for C.parvum had a higher hazard of being treated for respiratory disease. With respect to body weight, calves that had diarrhea or severe diarrhea had lower body weight at 49, 56, and 77 d. Specifically, calves that had an increased proportion of days with diarrhea showed a reduction in weight gain of up to 15 kg compared to calves without diarrhea. Calves that tested positive for C.parvum had a lower body weight at 49, 56, and 77 d; calves that tested positive for BCoV had a lower body weight at 56 and 77 d. This study demonstrates that the prevalence of BCoV, BRoV A, and C.parvum infection is high in this population of calves and has significant effects on the occurrence of diarrhea and body weight gain. Future studies should evaluate approaches for minimizing the effect of infection with these pathogens to improve the welfare, health, and productivity of dairy calves.","Renaud, D L; Rot, C; Marshall, J; Steele, M A",Journal of dairy science,https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2020-19215; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33309376/,264

Despite advances in therapeutic interventions, survival rates amongst HNSCC patients have remained static for years. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are tumor initiating cells that are highly resistant to treatment, and are hypothesized to contribute to a significant fraction of tumor recurrences. Consequently, further investigations of how CSCs mediate recurrence may provide insights into novel druggable targets. A key element of recurrence involves the tumor's ability to evade immunosurveillance. Recent published reports suggest that CSCs possess immunosuppressive properties, however, the underlying mechanism have yet to be fully elucidated. To date, most groups have focused on the role of CSC-derived secretory proteins, such as cytokines and growth factors. Here, we review the established immunoregulatory role of exosomes derived from mixed tumor cell populations, and propose further study of CSC-derived exosomes may be warranted. Such studies may yield novel insights into new druggable targets, or lay the foundation for future exosome-based diagnostics.","Clayton, Shannon M; Archard, Joehleen; Wagner, Joseph; Farwell, D Gregory; Bewley, Arnaud F; Beliveau, Angela; Birkeland, Andrew C; Rao, Shyam; Abouyared, Marianne; Belafsky, Peter; Anderson, Johnathon D",Stem cells and development,https://doi.org/10.1089/scd.2019.0197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31856674/,264

Our hospital-based registry for the year 2017 to 2018 showed that esophageal cancer constituted 22.7% of annual caseload. Most of our patients present in advanced stages. The aim of this article was to study the role of hormonal receptors in patients with esophageal cancer. Methods This is a single-institution, prospective, observational study in patients with esophageal carcinoma. Hormonal receptors (estrogen receptor [ER]-α and progesterone receptors) were studied in tumor tissue. Of 160 patients, receptor status was analyzed in 133 patients. Chi-square test was used for the correlation of categorical variables. The value of p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results A total of 133 patients was taken into the study of which 96 were males and 37 were females. The mean age of patients was 52 years. Carcinoma esophagus was predominantly seen in males. Estrogen and progesterone receptors were positive in 9.02 and 4.51% of the study population, respectively. Patients with hormonal receptor positivity presented with poor functional status, higher grades of dysphagia, higher stage, and most of the tumors were poorly differentiated with statistically significant p -values. Conclusion Despite recent advances in various fields of oncology, outcomes of esophageal carcinoma have not improved significantly. Hence, a study of new pathways of pathogenesis in carcinogenesis of esophageal carcinoma is essential. Few recent evidences including our study shows that the hormonal milieu is responsible in the pathogenesis of carcinoma esophagus. The utilization of this data and future study of the role of hormonal therapy might lead to improved outcomes in patients with carcinoma esophagus.","Kalita, Deepjyoti; Bannoth, Srinivas; Purkayastha, Joydeep; Talukdar, Abhijit; Das, Gaurav; Singh, Pritesh",South Asian journal of cancer,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1729448; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34136423/,264
65452,Eligibility and Predictors for Acute Revascularization Procedures in a Stroke Center.,2016,"BACKGROUND The promotion of healthy eating is a public health priority. Poor dietary behaviours, including low fruit and vegetable (F&V) consumption are of particular concern among children. Novel nutrition promotion strategies are needed to improve F&V consumption. Sustainability education could be used to support nutrition education within the school context. The purpose of this paper is to report the protocol for impact and process evaluation of the school-based Food Education and Sustainability Training (FEAST) program, designed to educate children about sustainability, food waste and nutrition, using hands-on cooking activities. METHODS A pragmatic, parallel, cluster non-randomized controlled trial with pre- and post-measures, will be implemented among 20 primary schools (10 intervention vs 10 wait-list-control) within NSW, Australia, involving children in Grades 5-6. FEAST is a curriculum-aligned program, delivered as a 1.5-h lesson/week, for a 10-week unit of inquiry, incorporating theory and cooking. FEAST was developed using theoretical frameworks which included Social Cognitive Theory and the Precede-Proceed Planning model. Primary outcomes include children's self-reported F&V intakes (serves/day). Food literacy constructs such as: nutrition knowledge, food preparation and cooking skills, self-efficacy and behaviours, food waste knowledge and behaviours and food production knowledge, will be assessed as secondary outcomes. Process evaluation will assess program reach, adoption, implementation, maintenance, satisfaction and perceived benefits by teachers and students. An online survey (including quantitative and qualitative questions) was developed for administration at baseline (impact evaluation) and immediately post-intervention (impact and process evaluation). Intervention effects on quantitative study outcomes will be estimated with ​generalised linear mixed models, including random effects and will follow the intention-to-treat principles. Open-ended questions embedded within the surveys will be analysed qualitatively using content and thematic analyses. DISCUSSION Results from this trial will provide valuable information on the value of adding environmental sustainability strategies to nutrition education in schools. Results will inform the design of future research and programs focused on primary-school children's nutrition, sustainability-related behaviours and experiential school-based interventions.

The fundamental role of DUBs is specific removal of ubiquitin from substrates. DUBs contribute to activation/deactivation, recycling and localization of numerous regulatory proteins, and thus play major roles in diverse cellular processes. Altered DUB activity is associated with a multitudes of pathologies including cancer. Therefore, DUBs represent novel candidates for target-directed drug development. AREAS COVERED The article is a thorough review/accounting of patented compounds targeting DUBs and stratifying/classifying the patented compounds based on: chemical-structures, nucleic-acid compositions, modes-of-action, and targeting sites. The review provides a brief background on the UPS and the involvement of DUBs. Furthermore, methods for assessing efficacy and potential pharmacological utility of DUB inhibitor (DUBi) are discussed. EXPERT OPINION The FDA's approval of the 20S proteasome inhibitors (PIs): bortezomib and carfilzomib for treatment of hematological malignancies established the UPS as an anti-cancer target. Unfortunately, many patients are inherently resistant or develop resistance to PIs. One potential strategy to combat PI resistance is targeting upstream components of the UPS such as DUBs. DUBs represent a promising potential therapeutic target due to their critical roles in various cellular processes including protein turnover, localization and cellular homeostasis. While considerable efforts have been undertaken to develop DUB modulators, significant advancements are necessary to move DUBis into the clinic.","Farshi, Pershang; Deshmukh, Rahul R; Nwankwo, Joseph O; Arkwright, Richard T; Cvek, Boris; Liu, Jinbao; Dou, Q Ping",Expert opinion on therapeutic patents,https://doi.org/10.1517/13543776.2015.1056737; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26077642/,264
67735,Successful treatment of brown widow spider envenomation with Latrodectus mactans antivenom.,2019,"BACKGROUND Autologous myoblasts have been tested in the treatment of muscle-related diseases. However, the standardization of manufacturing myoblasts is still not established. Here we report a flask and animal-free medium-based method of manufacturing clinical-grade myoblast together with establishing releasing criteria for myoblast products under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). METHODS Quadriceps muscle biopsy samples were donated from three patients with myogenic ptosis. After biopsy samples were digested through enzymatic dissociation, the cells were grown in T175 flasks (passage 0) and hyperflasks (passage 1) in the animal-free SkGMTM-2 skeletal muscle cell growth medium containing 5% human platelet lysate for 15-17 days. The harvested cells were released based on cell morphology, cell dose, viability, sterility, endotoxin, mycoplasma and immunophenotype. Myotube differentiation was also evaluated. RESULTS 400 to 500 million myoblast cells were manufactured within 15 to 17 days by the end of passage 1, which met pre-determined releasing criteria. The manufactured myoblast cells could differentiate and fuse into myotubes in vitro, with the possible trend that the donor age may impact the differentiation ability of myoblasts. CONCLUSIONS The present study establishes a flask-based method of manufacturing myoblast in the animal-free medium together with releasing criteria, which is simple, robust, inexpensive and easily reproducible. This study will serve as the validation for a planned phase 1 clinical trial to assess the use of autologous myoblast transplants for the treatment of myogenic ptosis and other myogenic diseases.","Lee-Wing, Matthew; Szwajcer, David; Lockwood, Anthony; Flynn, Alanna; Anjos, Karla; Tulloch, Marie; Giftakis, Angeline; Guan, Qingdong",Cytotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10616-020-00420-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32902721/,264

68190,Endothelial Injury in COVID-19 and Acute Infections: Putting the Pieces of the Puzzle Together.,2021-04-01,"OBJECTIVES The monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab is frequently applied in the treatment of lymphoma as well as autoimmune diseases and confers efficient depletion of recirculating B cells. Correspondingly, B cell-depleted patients barely mount de novo antibody responses during infections or vaccinations. Therefore, efficient immune responses of B cell-depleted patients largely depend on protective T cell responses. METHODS CD8+ T cell expansion was studied in rituximab-treated rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and B cell-deficient mice on vaccination/infection with different vaccines/pathogens. RESULTS Rituximab-treated RA patients vaccinated with Influvac showed reduced expansion of influenza-specific CD8+ T cells when compared with healthy controls. Moreover, B cell-deficient JHT mice infected with mouse-adapted Influenza or modified vaccinia virus Ankara showed less vigorous expansion of virus-specific CD8+ T cells than wild type mice. Of note, JHT mice do not have an intrinsic impairment of CD8+ T cell expansion, since infection with vaccinia virus induced similar T cell expansion in JHT and wild type mice. Direct type I interferon receptor signalling of B cells was necessary to induce several chemokines in B cells and to support T cell help by enhancing the expression of MHC-I. CONCLUSIONS Depending on the stimulus, B cells can modulate CD8+ T cell responses. Thus, B cell depletion causes a deficiency of de novo antibody responses and affects the efficacy of cellular response including cytotoxic T cells. The choice of the appropriate vaccine to vaccinate B cell-depleted patients has to be re-evaluated in order to efficiently induce protective CD8+ T cell responses.","Graalmann, Theresa; Borst, Katharina; Manchanda, Himanshu; Vaas, Lea; Bruhn, Matthias; Graalmann, Lukas; Koster, Mario; Verboom, Murielle; Hallensleben, Michael; Guzmán, Carlos Alberto; Sutter, Gerd; Schmidt, Reinhold E; Witte, Torsten; Kalinke, Ulrich",Annals of the rheumatic diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-220435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34226189/,264
68623,A quality improvement project to increase palliative care team involvement in pediatric oncology patients.,2020-11-19,"INTRODUCTION Liver surgery was one of the last fields to be conquered by laparoscopy, which has become safe and effective, especially for left lateral sectionectomy (LLS) and limited peripheral resections. However, major hepatectomies remain challenging. Laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery is being employed for an increasing variety of surgical sites and indications. PRESENTATION OF CASE Three patients underwent LESS hepatectomy. A 36-year-old woman had LLS for a 38-mm adenoma, an 85-year-old woman an atypical resection of segment VI for a 12-mm hepatocellular carcinoma and a 41-year-old woman an atypical right anterior resection for a 9cm symptomatic FNH. Procedures were performed transperitoneally with a single-port device, via a 20-mm or 30-mm incision. Operative times were 110min for LLS, 100min for the atypical segment VI resection and 120min for the atypical right anterior liver resection. Blood loss was less than 50ml in the first two patients and 150ml in the third. Postoperative courses were uneventful. The first two patients were discharged on postoperative day 3 and the third on postoperative day 1. DISCUSSION To date, some case reports and series of LESS liver surgery have been published. We performed the reported hepatectomies after a considerable experience in laparoscopic hepatic surgery and after applying the LESS approach to other procedures. Our hepatectomy technique was not modified by the use of the single-port and results were very encouraging. CONCLUSION We believe that in selected patients, both peripheral resections and LLS are feasible by LESS surgery, with good intra-operative and post-operative results.","Tzanis, Dimitrios; Lainas, Panagiotis; Tranchart, Hadrien; Pourcher, Guillaume; Devaquet, Niaz; Perlemuter, Gabriel; Naveau, Sylvie; Dagher, Ibrahim",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2013.11.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25108073/,264

70393,Dystonia as a prominent presenting feature in developmental and epileptic encephalopathies: A case series.,2021-08-11,"BACKGROUND Whilst nutrition is vital to survival in health, the precise role of nutrition during critical illness is controversial. More specifically, the exact amount of energy that is required during critical illness to optimally influence clinical outcomes remains unknown. The aim of this systematic literature review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the clinical effects of optimising nutrition to critically ill adult patients, such that the entire predicted amount of energy that the patient requires is delivered, on mortality and other important outcomes. METHODS A systematic literature review and meta-analysis will be conducted by searching for studies indexed in Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and the Cochrane Library. Searches will be restricted to English. Studies will be considered for inclusion if they are a parallel randomised controlled trial investigating a nutrition intervention in an adult critical care population, where one arm delivers 'full predicted energy from nutrition' (defined as provision of ≥80% of the predicted energy required) and the other arm delivers energy less than 80% of the predicted requirement. Two authors will independently perform title screening, full-text screening, data extraction and quality assessment for this review. The quality of individual studies will be assessed using the 'Risk of Bias' tool, and to assess the overall body of evidence, a 'Summary of Findings' table and the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation system will be used, all recommended by the Cochrane Library. Pending the study heterogeneity that is determined, a fixed-effect meta-analysis with pre-defined subgroup analyses will be performed. DISCUSSION Currently, it is controversial whether optimal energy delivery is beneficial for outcomes in critically ill patients. This systematic review and meta-analysis will evaluate whether delivering optimal energy to critically ill adult patients improves outcomes when compared to delivery of lesser amounts.

70543,Virtual echocardiography screening tool to differentiate hemodynamic profiles in pulmonary hypertension.,2020,"SARS-CoV2 infection or COVID-19 has created panic around the world since its first origin in December 2019 in Wuhan city, China. The COVID-19 pandemic has infected more than 46.4 million people, with 1,199,727 deaths. The immune system plays a crucial role in the severity of COVID-19 and the development of pneumonia-induced acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Along with providing protection, both innate and T cell-based adaptive immune response dysregulate during severe SARS-CoV2 infection. This dysregulation is more pronounced in older population and patients with comorbidities (Diabetes, hypertension, obesity, other pulmonary and autoimmune diseases). However, COVID-19 patients develop protective antibodies (Abs) against SARS-CoV2, but they do not long for last. The induction of the immune response against the pathogen also requires metabolic energy that generates through the process of immunometabolism. The change in the metabolic stage of immune cells from homeostasis to an inflammatory or infectious environment is called immunometabolic reprogramming. The article describes the cellular immunology (macrophages, T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, NK cells and pulmonary epithelial cells (PEC) and vascular endothelial cells) and the associated immune response during COVID-19. Immunometabolism may serve as a cell-specific therapeutic approach to target COVID-19.","Kumar, Vijay",International reviews of immunology,https://doi.org/10.1080/08830185.2020.1840567; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33155525/,264

Approximately 20% of patients with COVID-19 develop severe disease and 5% of patients require intensive care2. Severe disease has been associated with changes in peripheral immune activity, including increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines3,4 that may be produced by a subset of inflammatory monocytes5,6, lymphopenia7,8 and T cell exhaustion9,10. To elucidate pathways in peripheral immune cells that might lead to immunopathology or protective immunity in severe COVID-19, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from seven patients hospitalized for COVID-19, four of whom had acute respiratory distress syndrome, and six healthy controls. We identify reconfiguration of peripheral immune cell phenotype in COVID-19, including a heterogeneous interferon-stimulated gene signature, HLA class II downregulation and a developing neutrophil population that appears closely related to plasmablasts appearing in patients with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Importantly, we found that peripheral monocytes and lymphocytes do not express substantial amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Physical (social) distancing - a counter-measure with no alternative, but with no precedence in scope and scale either - is a key intervention and trigger of natural experiments. From a practical perspective, concerned disciplines should increase awareness of, provide recommendations to meet, and develop research for, health challenges arising from physical distancing at home. From the field of chronobiology, prolonged home stays may place undue strain on the body's circadian timing system but straightforward and often underestimated advice for coping can be provided (herein we provide such advice). Of course, advice or recommendations from other concerned disciplines that identify challenges associated with current COVID-19 mitigation strategies are also needed.

However, neonatal thermal care guidelines applicable to intra-hospital transport beyond the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and during surgery or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are lacking. The aim of this study is to determine the proportion of infants normothermic (36.5-37.5°C) on return to NICU after management during surgery and MRI, and during standard clinical care in both environments. METHODS Sixty-two newborns requiring either surgery in the operating theatre (OT) (n = 41) or an MRI scan (n = 21) at the Royal Children's Hospital (Melbourne) NICU were prospectively studied. Core temperature, along with cardiorespiratory parameters, was continuously measured from 15 min prior to leaving the NICU until 60 min after returning. Passive and active warming (intra-operatively) was at clinician discretion. RESULTS The study reported 90% of infants were normothermic before leaving NICU: 86% (MRI) and 93% (OT). Only 52% of infants were normothermic on return to NICU (relative risk (RR) 1.75; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39-2.31; number needed to harm (NNH) 2.6). Between departure from the NICU and commencement of surgery, core temperature decreased by mean 0.81°C (95% CI 0.30-1.33; P = 0.0001, analysis of variance), with only 24% of infants normothermic when surgery began (P < 0.0001; RR 3.80 (95% CI 2.33-6.74); NNH 1.5). After an MRI, infants were a mean 0.41°C (95% CI 0.16-0.67) colder than immediately before entering the scanner (P = 0.001, analysis of variance), with only 43% being normothermic (P = 0.003; RR 2.11 (95% CI 1.35-3.74); NNH 2.1). CONCLUSION Unintentional hypothermia is a common occurrence during surgery in the OT and MRI in neonates, indicating that evidence-based warming strategies to prevent hypothermia should be developed.","Don Paul, Joel M; Perkins, Elizabeth J; Pereira-Fantini, Prue M; Suka, Asha; Farrell, Olivia; Gunn, Julia K; Rajapaksa, Anushi E; Tingay, David G",Journal of paediatrics and child health,https://doi.org/10.1111/jpc.13824; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29330886/,264

This has potential implications for the growing population of CI users who are ≥65 years of age because of age-related auditory temporal processing deficits. The goal of this study was to measure temporal processing ability in a gap detection task in younger, middle-aged, and older CI users and to determine the relative contributions of chronological age and peripheral neural survival to performance. Single-electrode gap detection thresholds (GDTs) were measured using direct stimulation at five electrode locations and three electrical stimulation rates. The relationship between peripheral status (e.g., electrode-to-neural interface) and GDTs was assessed by the slope of the electrically evoked compound action potential (ECAP) amplitude growth function. Results showed that ECAP slope was the strongest subject-level predictor of GDTs. Steeper ECAP slopes, which are partially indicative of better peripheral function, were associated with better GDTs in younger participants. However, ECAP slope significantly interacted with stimulation rate and age, suggesting that ECAP slopes were not predictive of GDTs in middle-aged and older participants at some stimulation rates. ECAP slope was also related to age, with middle-aged and older participants exhibiting relatively shallow slopes and smaller ranges of slopes compared with younger participants. This pattern of ECAP results limited the evaluation of the independent effects of aging per se and peripheral status on temporal processing ability.","Shader, Maureen J; Gordon-Salant, Sandra; Goupell, Matthew J",Trends in hearing,https://doi.org/10.1177/2331216520956560; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32941111/,264

BACKGROUND Crowding in emergency departments (EDs) is a widely reported problem leading to increased service times and patients leaving without being seen. METHODS Using ED historical data and expert estimates, we created a discrete-event simulation model. We analyzed the likely impact of initiating care and boarding patients in the hallway (hallway care) instead of the exam rooms and adding a dedicated triage space for patients who arrive by emergency medical services (EMS triage) to decrease hallway congestion. The scenarios were compared in terms of LOS, time spent in exam rooms and hallway spaces, service time, blocked time, and utilization rate. RESULTS The hallway care scenario resulted in significantly lower LOS and exam room time only for EMS patients but when implemented along with the EMS triage scenario, a significantly lower LOS and exam room time was observed for all patients (EMS and walk-in). The combination of two simulated scenarios resulted in significant improvements in other flow metrics as well. CONCLUSIONS Our findings discourage boarding of admitted patients in ED exam rooms. If space limitations require that admitted patients be placed in ED hallways, designers and planners should consider enabling hallway spaces with features recommended in this article. Alternative locations for boarding should be prioritized in or out of the ED. Our findings also encourage establishing a triage area dedicated to EMS patients in the ED.","Valipoor, Shabboo; Hatami, Mohsen; Hakimjavadi, Hesamedin; Akçalı, Elif; Swan, Wendy A; De Portu, Giuliano",HERD,https://doi.org/10.1177/1937586720969933; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33176477/,264

In this proof-of-concept study, we present a novel closed-loop neurofeedback procedure intended to remediate this bias. Internal attentional states were detected in real time by applying machine learning techniques to functional magnetic resonance imaging data on a cloud server; these attentional states were externalized using a visual stimulus that the participant could learn to control. We trained 15 participants with major depressive disorder and 12 healthy control participants over 3 functional magnetic resonance imaging sessions. Exploratory analysis showed that participants with major depressive disorder were initially more likely than healthy control participants to get stuck in negative attentional states, but this diminished with neurofeedback training relative to controls. Depression severity also decreased from pre- to posttraining. These results demonstrate that our method is sensitive to the negative attentional bias in major depressive disorder and showcase the potential of this novel technique as a treatment that can be evaluated in future clinical trials.","Mennen, Anne C; Turk-Browne, Nicholas B; Wallace, Grant; Seok, Darsol; Jaganjac, Adna; Stock, Janet; deBettencourt, Megan T; Cohen, Jonathan D; Norman, Kenneth A; Sheline, Yvette I",Biological psychiatry.

Lung protective ventilation strategy with a low tidal volume and low pressure, in addition to a conservative fluid management approach, is recommended when treating patients with ARDS. Low-dose steroids may be considered in the treatment of refractory septic shock. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) may play a limited supportive role for early ARDS/acute lung injury, but it is contra-indicated in critically ill patients with multi-organ failure and haemodynamic instability. NPPV and oxygen therapy should be applied in healthcare facilities with good ventilation and respiratory protection as substantial exposure to exhaled air occurs within a 0.5 m and 0.4 m radius of patients receiving NPPV and oxygen via a simple mask, respectively.

More data are needed to explore the potential role of other drugs with immuno-modulating properties such as statins. Healthcare workers currently must apply strict standards, contact and droplet precautions when dealing with suspected cases, and upgrade to airborne precautions when performing aerosol-generating procedures. Non-pharmacological measures such as early case isolation, household quarantine, school/workplace closure, good community hygiene and restrictions on travel are useful measures in controlling a pandemic.","Hui, David S C",Respirology,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1843.2008.01250.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18366525/,264

Objective To describe testing for SARS-CoV-2 and the epidemiology of infected patients. Design, Setting, and Participants A retrospective cohort study was conducted using electronic health record data from 135 794 patients younger than 25 years who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 from January 1 through September 8, 2020. Data were from PEDSnet, a network of 7 US pediatric health systems, comprising 6.5 million patients primarily from 11 states. Data analysis was performed from September 8 to 24, 2020. Exposure Testing for SARS-CoV-2. Main Outcomes and Measures SARS-CoV-2 infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) illness. Results A total of 135 794 pediatric patients (53% male; mean [SD] age, 8.8 [6.7] years; 3% Asian patients, 15% Black patients, 11% Hispanic patients, and 59% White patients; 290 per 10 000 population [range, 155-395 per 10 000 population across health systems]) were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and 5374 (4%) were infected with the virus (12 per 10 000 population [range, 7-16 per 10 000 population]). Compared with White patients, those of Black, Hispanic, and Asian race/ethnicity had lower rates of testing (Black: odds ratio [OR], 0.70 [95% CI, 0.68-0.72]; Hispanic: OR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.63-0.67]; Asian: OR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.57-0.63]); however, they were significantly more likely to have positive test results (Black: OR, 2.66 [95% CI, 2.43-2.90]; Hispanic: OR, 3.75 [95% CI, 3.39-4.15]; Asian: OR, 2.04 [95% CI, 1.69-2.48]). Older age (5-11 years: OR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.13-1.38]; 12-17 years: OR, 1.92 [95% CI, 1.73-2.12]; 18-24 years: OR, 3.51 [95% CI, 3.11-3.97]), public payer (OR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.31-1.57]), outpatient testing (OR, 2.13 [1.86-2.44]), and emergency department testing (OR, 3.16 [95% CI, 2.72-3.67]) were also associated with increased risk of infection. In univariate analyses, nonmalignant chronic disease was associated with lower likelihood of testing, and preexisting respiratory conditions were associated with lower risk of positive test results (standardized ratio [SR], 0.78 [95% CI, 0.73-0.84]). However, several other diagnosis groups were associated with a higher risk of positive test results: malignant disorders (SR, 1.54 [95% CI, 1.19-1.93]), cardiac disorders (SR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.05-1.32]), endocrinologic disorders (SR, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.31-1.75]), gastrointestinal disorders (SR, 2.00 [95% CI, 1.04-1.38]), genetic disorders (SR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.00-1.40]), hematologic disorders (SR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.06-1.47]), musculoskeletal disorders (SR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.07-1.30]), mental health disorders (SR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.10-1.30]), and metabolic disorders (SR, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.24-1.61]). Among the 5374 patients with positive test results, 359 (7%) were hospitalized for respiratory, hypotensive, or COVID-19-specific illness. Of these, 99 (28%) required intensive care unit services, and 33 (9%) required mechanical ventilation. The case fatality rate was 0.2% (8 of 5374). The number of patients with a diagnosis of Kawasaki disease in early 2020 was 40% lower (259 vs 433 and 430) than in 2018 or 2019. Conclusions and Relevance In this large cohort study of US pediatric patients, SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were low, and clinical manifestations were typically mild. Black, Hispanic, and Asian race/ethnicity; adolescence and young adulthood; and nonrespiratory chronic medical conditions were associated with identified infection. Kawasaki disease diagnosis is not an effective proxy for multisystem inflammatory syndrome of childhood.","Bailey, L Charles; Razzaghi, Hanieh; Burrows, Evanette K; Bunnell, H Timothy; Camacho, Peter E F; Christakis, Dimitri A; Eckrich, Daniel; Kitzmiller, Melody; Lin, Simon M; Magnusen, Brianna C; Newland, Jason; Pajor, Nathan M; Ranade, Daksha; Rao, Suchitra; Sofela, Olamiji; Zahner, Janet; Bruno, Cortney; Forrest, Christopher B",JAMA pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2020.5052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33226415/,264
73752,Does Antiplatelet Therapy during Bridging Thrombolysis Increase Rates of Intracerebral Hemorrhage in Stroke Patients?,2017,"Malaria is a fatal parasitic disease with unelucidated pathogenetic mechanism. Herein, we aimed to uncover genes associated with different clinical aspects of malaria based on the GSE1124 dataset that is publicly accessible by using WGCNA. We obtained 16 co-expression modules and their correlations with clinical features. Using the MCODE tool, we identified THEM4, STYX, VPS36, LCOR, KIAA1143, EEA1, RAPGEF6, LOC439994, ZBTB33, PTPN22, ESCO1, and KLF3 as hub genes positively associated with Plasmodium falciparum infection (ASPF). These hub genes were involved in the biological processes of endosomal transport, regulation of natural killer cell proliferation, and KEGG pathways of endocytosis and fatty acid elongation. For the purple module negatively correlated with ASPF, we identified 19 hub genes that were involved in the biological processes of positive regulation of cellular protein catabolic process and KEGG pathways of other glycan degradation. For the salmon module positively correlated with severe malaria anemia (SMA), we identified 17 hub genes that were among those driving the biological processes of positive regulation of erythrocyte differentiation. For the brown module positively correlated with cerebral malaria (CM), we identified eight hub genes and these genes participated in phagolysosome assembly and positive regulation of exosomal secretion, and animal mitophagy pathway. For the tan module negatively correlated with CM, we identified four hub genes that were involved in CD8-positive, alpha-beta T cell differentiation and notching signaling pathway. These findings may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of malaria and help define new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for malaria patients.","Nambou, Komi; Nie, Xiaoling; Tong, Yin; Anakpa, Manawa","Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2021.104723; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33444859/,264

Laboratory examination showed increased serum creatinine and decreased serum albumin levels, complement activity, and cryoglobulin positivity. The HCV RNA genotype was found to be 1b, and the viral load was high. Kidney biopsy examination showed type I membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with capillary deposition of IgM and C3, indicating HCV-related glomerulonephritis. After hospitalization, hemodialysis was immediately required because of uremia and oliguria. Her renal function did not improve despite corticosteroid therapy. To treat the increasing HCV load, virus removal and eradication by double-filtration plasmapheresis therapy without interferon was performed, since the patient was allergic to interferon therapy. This treatment improved renal function and allowed the withdrawal from hemodialysis.

74598,The Effect of Standardizing Autologous Prime Techniques in Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery with Cardiopulmonary Bypass.,2019-12-01,"BACKGROUND/AIM Kidney cancers account for about 2% of human malignancies. In recent decades, the incidence of this cancer type has gradually increased, mainly due to advances in imaging. The metastatic potential of these cancers is significant: a quarter of patients will immediately present with metastases and more than one third of patients treated with nephrectomy for a localized disease will develop metastases during their course. In total, more than half of patients will suffer from the consequences of metastasis. The median survival at this stage is only thirteen months, so the therapeutic challenge is immense. CASE REPORT The present case report describes a case of left renal clear cell carcinoma with brain, lung, right adrenal, bone and lymph node metastases in a 55-year-old male. The patient received only one line of anticancer treatment with sunitinib, which could not be continued due to haemorrhagic manifestations in brain metastases. The treatment was changed with immunotherapy which showed its effect even if it was stopped due to the patient wishes in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic. CONCLUSION Immunotherapy opens the doors to a new era in treatment of metastatic renal cancer and shows efficiency even after it has been stopped.","Haineala, Bogdan; Zgura, Anca; Diaconu, Camelia; Mehedintu, Claudia; Bacinschi, Xenia; Anghel, Rodica Maricela",In vivo,https://doi.org/10.21873/invivo.12441; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33910866/,264

The research intent was to discover whether pathogenic or nonpathogenic species cause a high rate of symptomless Entamoeba infections. Stool samples were microscopically examined, and the 18S-rRNA gene was targeted utilizing the nested PCR technique in the positive specimens. Initial results based on morphological features showed that the Entamoeba prevalence rate was 7.4%. Significantly higher rates of infections were seen in females than in males and in low-income people than in moderate-income people. The incidence rates among the asymptomatic individuals, as determined by molecular analysis, were as follows: E. histolytica - 6%, E. dispar - 4.3%, and E. moshkovskii - 0.3%. Of all the Entamoeba positive samples, a single infection with E. histolytica was identified in 41.4% samples; the single infection with E. dispar in 18.6% samples, 35.7% samples had mixed infections with two Entamoeba species, and 4.3% had mixed infections with three species. The current study concluded that 7.4% of healthy people, who live in the endemic area under investigation, carry Entamoeba species asymptomatically. Additionally, the majority of asymptomatic Entamoeba infections were caused by the pathogenic E. histolytica (81.4%) compared to E. dispar (58.6%), and E. moshkovskii with the lowest rate of infection. Single and co-infections with E. histolytica and E. dispar were noted. E. moshkovskii, which was identified for the first time in the region, was only seen in mixed infections.

76121,Redundancy in meta-analyses publications-Time to pull the plug.,2021-06-01,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented challenge for medical professionals throughout the world to tackle the rapidly changing scenario. The objective of this survey was to analyze the change in neurosurgical practice in India following the COVID-19 outbreak and assess its impact on practising neurosurgeons. Materials and Methods Between May 7th and 23rd, 2020, a validated questionnaire was circulated amongst practising neurosurgeons across the country by social media and e-mails, regarding changes in the patterns of patients seen, adaptations made in their practice, effect on surgeries performed, financial burden, and impact on their personal lives. The responses were kept anonymous and were analyzed for correlations between the changes observed and independent factors such as hospital affiliations, teaching professions, and neurosurgical experience. Results Our survey showed a drastic fall in the number of neurosurgical patients seen in the outpatient department (OPD) as well as the number of surgeries performed. A drop of 76.25% was seen in OPD patients (P = 0.000) and that of 70.59% in surgeries performed (P = 0.000). There was no uniformity among the neurosurgeons in the number of COVID-19 tests being done before elective/emergency surgery and in the use of protective gear while examining patients. Private practitioners were more affected financially as compared to those in the government sector. The pandemic has affected the research work of 53.23% of all respondents, with those in the teaching profession (70.96%) more affected than those in the non-teaching profession (24.67%). Conclusions Evidence-based policies, screening COVID-19 tests with better sensitivity, and better-quality personal protective equipment kits in adequate numbers are required to protect our medical professionals from COVID-19. Mental health issues among neurosurgeons may also be an issue, this being a high risk speciality and should be closely watched for.","Venkataram, Tejas; Goyal, Nishant; Dash, Chinmaya; Chandra, Prarthana P; Chaturvedi, Jitender; Raheja, Amol; Singla, Raghav; Sardhara, Jayesh; Singh, Bhoopendra; Gupta, Ravi",Neurology India,https://doi.org/10.4103/0028-3886.289004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32643671/,264

Catheter-directed thrombolysis has been shown in one randomized controlled trial to reduce the risk of post-thrombotic syndrome in patients with acute lower extremity deep vein thrombosis; data from a larger national institute of health trial are expected in early 2017. The use of catheter-directed thrombolysis is also being increasingly considered for patients with submassive or massive pulmonary embolism. Preliminary studies suggest that endovascular stent placement and ablative therapies may be used to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life in severely affected patients with established post-thrombotic syndrome.

Data needed to support this decision-making process include estimates of dose, dose-rate, dose uniformity, synchronous or metachronous injuries, donor availability and alternative interventions. Many of these co-variates have substantial uncertainties. Fundamental is a consideration of potential benefit-to-risk and risk-to-benefit ratios under conditions of substantial inaccuracy and imprecision.

76675,Subxiphoid left atrial ablation for atrial fibrillation.,2020-11-30,"BACKGROUND Streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis (SDSE) acts as an etiological agent for lameness, neurological signs, and high mortality in pigs. Despite its importance in pig industries and zoonotic potential, little is known about the effects of this pathogen. OBJECTIVES This study aimed to determine the molecular characteristics and antimicrobial resistance of SDSE strains isolated from diseased pigs. METHODS A total 11 SDSE isolates were obtained from diseased pigs. Bacterial identification, PCR for virulence genes, emm typing, and antimicrobial resistance genes, multilocus sequence typing, and antimicrobial susceptibility test were performed. RESULTS Nine isolates were from piglets, and 8 showed lameness, sudden death, or neurological signs. The isolates were PCR-positive for sla (100%), sagA (100%), and scpA (45.5%), and only 1 isolate amplified the emm gene (stL2764). Eight different sequence types were detected, categorized into 2 clonal complexes and 4 singletons. All the isolates in this study were included in a small cluster, which also contained other strains derived from humans and horses. The minimum inhibitory concentrations for the tested beta-lactams were low, while those for macrolides, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones were relatively high. PCR analysis of the macrolide and tetracycline resistance genes demonstrated that the isolates carried erm(B) (18.2%, n = 2), mef(A/E) (9.1%, n = 1), tet(M) (18.2%, n = 2), and tet(O) (90.2%, n = 10). Two isolates presented a mutation in parC, which is associated with fluoroquinolone resistance. CONCLUSION This study provided insight into swine-derived SDSE, as it is related to veterinary medicine, and elucidated its zoonotic potential, in the context of molecular epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance in public health.","Oh, Sang Ik; Kim, Jong Wan; Kim, Jongho; So, Byungjae; Kim, Bumseok; Kim, Ha Young",Journal of veterinary science,https://doi.org/10.4142/jvs.2020.21.e57; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32735095/,264

This study aimed to highlight gaps in service provision and areas for improvement by examining a cohort of patients with complications referred to a tertiary centre. METHOD Examination was carried out of a password-protected electronic database of all LVMRs operated on in one institution. RESULTS Fifty patients (45 women), median age 54 (range, 24-71) years, were referred with early symptomatic failure (n = 27) following an inadequate LVMR or major mesh complications (erosion into another organ, fistulation or stricturing) (n = 23). All were amenable to remedial laparoscopic surgery. Functional improvements were found in pre- and postoperative ODS, Wexner (FI) scores (two-tailed t-test; P < 0.0001) and quality of life (Birmingham Bowel and Urinary Symptoms Questionnaire-22) scores at 3 months (two-tailed t-test; P < 0.001) and normalization at 1 year (P < 0.015). This was mirrored by improved linear bowel symptom severity visual analogue scale scores (two-tailed t-test; P < 0.0001 at 3 months and P = 0.015 at 1 year) .

We investigated the association between AF and inflammation of the EAT around the LA. METHODS We retrospectively identified regions of EAT around the LA and measured the density of these areas using computed tomography (CT). RESULTS A total of 32 patients who underwent their first catheter ablation for paroxysmal AF (PAF) were enrolled (mean age 62.5±11.1 years). Patients without a history of AF (n=32), but who underwent cardiac CT and were matched by age, sex, and metabolic risk factors, were enrolled in the control group (62.2±12.1 years). The mean EAT density around the LA was significantly higher in the PAF group than in the control group (-108.1±6.7 vs. -111.6±5.5 Hounsfield units; p=0.02), while the densities of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) in the abdomen and thorax did not differ between the two groups. In a multiple logistic regression analysis, a higher EAT density was significantly associated with the presence of PAF after adjusting for other risk factors (odds ratio: 1.25; 95% confidence interval: 1.08-1.45, p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS This study supports the hypothesis that inflammation of EAT around the LA, but not SAT, is related to the presence of PAF.","Kusayama, Takashi; Furusho, Hiroshi; Kashiwagi, Haruka; Kato, Takeshi; Murai, Hisayoshi; Usui, Soichiro; Kaneko, Shuichi; Takamura, Masayuki",Journal of cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jjcc.2015.11.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26685730/,264

78087,Clinical study of pulmonary CT lesions and associated bronchiectasis in 115 convalescent patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) in China.,2021-03-03,"Background The annual seasonal influenza epidemics in the winter season lead to many hospital admissions, increasing risks of nosocomial infections. Infectious diseases caused by contagious respiratory pathogens also pose a great risk to hospitals as has been seen in the current epidemic by a novel coronavirus infection. Such risk occurs in high density patient settings with few or no partitions, since the pathogens are transmitted by aerosols discharged from the patients. Possible interventions against the transmission are needed. Methods We developed a compact, lightweight, and portable hood designed to cover just the top half of a patient sitting or lying in bed, to limit the dissemination of infectious aerosols, constructed out of lightweight pipes, transparent plastic curtains, and a fan-filter-unit (FFU). The containment efficacy of the product was tested using an aerosolized cultured influenza virus tracer and an optimal airflow rate was determined according to the test results. It was tested for use in hospital wards during the 2016-2018 influenza seasons. Results The hood, named as Barrihood®, had dimensions height 172 cm, width 97 cm, length 38 cm, weighed 26 kg, and easily strolled and unfolded from its stored to its fully operational state of length 125 cm within a few minutes by a single operator. Optimal operational airflow-rate of the FFU was 420 L/min for containment of the aerosol particles. Eighty-one uninfected patients remained for 176 cumulative person-days within 1-4 m of influenza-infected patients isolated within the hood, without acquiring influenza infection. Conclusions With the use of the hood, secondary influenza infection cases significantly decreased, compared to previous influenza seasons. It may be suited to hospitals with not enough/no negative pressure facilities, or without enough number of individual patient isolation rooms, and could contribute to decrease the risk of nosocomial infections.","Nishimura, Hidekazu; Sakata, Soichiro",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd-20-1072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32802447/,264

To gain insight into COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA), we analyzed the genomes and characterized the phenotypic profiles of four CAPA isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus obtained from patients treated in the area of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. By examining the mutational spectrum of single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertion-deletion polymorphisms, and copy number variants among 206 genes known to modulate A. fumigatus virulence, we found that CAPA isolate genomes do not exhibit significant differences from the genome of the Af293 reference strain. By examining a number of factors, including virulence in an invertebrate moth model, growth in the presence of osmotic, cell wall, and oxidative stressors, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, and the MIC of antifungal drugs, we found that CAPA isolates were generally, but not always, similar to A. fumigatus reference strains Af293 and CEA17. Notably, CAPA isolate D had more putative loss-of-function mutations in genes known to increase virulence when deleted. Moreover, CAPA isolate D was significantly more virulent than the other three CAPA isolates and the A. fumigatus reference strains Af293 and CEA17, but similarly virulent to two other clinical strains of A. fumigatus. These findings expand our understanding of the genomic and phenotypic characteristics of isolates that cause CAPA. IMPORTANCE The global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has already killed millions of people. COVID-19 patient outcome can be further complicated by secondary infections, such as COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA). CAPA is caused by Aspergillus fungal pathogens, but there is little information about the genomic and phenotypic characteristics of CAPA isolates. We conducted genome sequencing and extensive phenotyping of four CAPA isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus from Germany. We found that CAPA isolates were often, but not always, similar to other reference strains of A. fumigatus across 206 genetic determinants of infection-relevant phenotypes, including virulence. For example, CAPA isolate D was more virulent than other CAPA isolates and reference strains in an invertebrate model of fungal disease, but similarly virulent to two other clinical strains. These results expand our understanding of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis.","Steenwyk, Jacob L; Mead, Matthew E; de Castro, Patrícia Alves; Valero, Clara; Damasio, André; Dos Santos, Renato A C; Labella, Abigail L; Li, Yuanning; Knowles, Sonja L; Raja, Huzefa A; Oberlies, Nicholas H; Zhou, Xiaofan; Cornely, Oliver A; Fuchs, Frieder; Koehler, Philipp; Goldman, Gustavo H; Rokas, Antonis",Microbiology spectrum,https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.00010-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34106569/,264

The most widely used intracranial stents for stent-assisted coiling are Neuroform (NF) and Enterprise (EP) stents. The purposes of this study are to review the recent literature of the past 5 years to compare outcomes between the EP and NF stent-assist coiling systems so as to comment on the safety, efficacy, complications, and recurrence rate of stent-assisted coiling in general. Methods PubMed was used to search for all published literature of NF or EP stent-assisted coiling of unruptured cerebral aneurysms from January 2014 to August 2019 with the search terms of ""Enterprise stent-assisted coiling,"" ""Neuroform stent,"" and ""Neuroform vs. Enterprise stent."" Results Twenty two publications met the inclusion criteria which encompass 1764 patients and 1873 aneurysms. Out of these 1873 aneurysms, 1007 aneurysms were treated with EP stent and 866 aneurysms were treated with NF stent. The overall outcome was low rates of thromboembolic complications (4.37%) and intracranial hemorrhage (1.13%), low permanent morbidity (1.70%) and mortality (0.40%), and lower rate of recanalization (11%). Data analysis shows an overall higher rate of complication and recurrence of aneurysm and lower overall rate of aneurysmal occlusion in the patients where EP stent was used in comparison to NF stent. However, this difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions The review of two stent-assisted coiling devices using EP and NF stents including 1873 aneurysms in 1764 patients revealed that overall, it is safe and effective with comparable outcomes.","Goyal, Ram Kumar; Kato, Yoko; Kawase, Tsukasa; Suzuki, Kentaro; Yamada, Yashuhiro; Sharma, Saurabh; Balasubramanian, Sneha Chitra; Tanaka, Riki; Miyatani, Kyosuke; Daijiro, Kojima",Asian journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.4103/ajns.ajns_284_19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32181165/,264
79436,Timing of Decompressive Hemicraniectomy for Stroke: A Nationwide Inpatient Sample Analysis.,2017,"OBJECTIVE Direct aorta ascending approach [transaortic approach (TAo)] is a new access way for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) to be used in patients with peripheral vascular disease and as an alternative to transapical approach. METHODS Both the Edwards SAPIEN and CoreValve systems were used. Depending on the position of the ascending aorta, the relation to the sternum, the brachiocephalic vein, vein grafts, and left and right internal mammary artery grafts from previous heart surgery, either right minithoracotomy or left ministernotomy was selected. Computed tomographic scan with reconstruction was applied for this decision making. A hybrid operating room was used with echocardiographic and fluoroscopy guidance. RESULTS We have done 30 procedures via the aorta ascendens. The mean age of the patients was 80 years, and 18 were men. The mean Logistic EuroSCORE of 33 reflects the comorbidities. More than half of the patients had coronary vessel disease and had undergone coronary artery bypass graft; 20% had abdominal aortic aneurysm. The mean ejection fraction was 41%, and the patients were in New York Heart Association class III to IV. The mean gradient was 50 mm Hg, and the mean valve area was 0.7 cm. The mean valve size was 28 mm. The use of Edwards SAPIEN versus CoreValve was 50%/50%, and thoracotomy versus sternotomy was 9 versus 21. All procedures were done successfully, but one patient had a periprocedural valve-in-valve implantation. Twenty-two patients were extubated in the operation room. The patients stayed in the intensive care unit for one night. Six patients were reoperated on. One patient had a postoperative balloon aortic valvuloplasty. The overall survival was 81% (follow up, 1-18 months). CONCLUSIONS Access design is an important issue in TAVI. When central approach is needed, TAVI-TAo is safe. For patients with low ejection fraction, the TAVI-TAo is preferred to the TAVI-transapical. The cannulation technique of the aorta is well known for cardiothoracic surgeons, and the method is feasible both for the Medtronic CoreValve and the Edwards SAPIEN valve, either via right minithoracotomy or ministernotomy to obtain the best coaxial alignment. It seems easier to position the bigger valves more precisely via this central approach.","Dahle, Gry; Rein, Kjell-Arne",Innovations,https://doi.org/10.1097/imi.0000000000000046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24553056/,264

Accurate serology testing is urgently needed to help diagnose infection, determine past exposure of populations and assess the response to a future vaccine. The landscape of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. In this study, we utilized the luciferase immunoprecipitation system to assess the antibody responses to 15 different SARS-CoV-2 antigens in patients with COVID-19. We identified new targets of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and show that nucleocapsid, open reading frame (ORF)8 and ORF3b elicit the strongest specific antibody responses. ORF8 and ORF3b antibodies, taken together as a cluster of points, identified 96.5% of COVID-19 samples at early and late time points of disease with 99.5% specificity. Our findings could be used to develop second-generation diagnostic tests to improve serological assays for COVID-19 and are important in understanding pathogenicity.","Hachim, Asmaa; Kavian, Niloufar; Cohen, Carolyn A; Chin, Alex W H; Chu, Daniel K W; Mok, Chris K P; Tsang, Owen T Y; Yeung, Yiu Cheong; Perera, Ranawaka A P M; Poon, Leo L M; Peiris, J S Malik; Valkenburg, Sophie A",Nature immunology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41590-020-0773-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32807944/,264

79765,"Comparison of Clinical, Laboratory and Demographic Characteristics of Patients Diagnosed with COVID-19 as Symptomatic and Atypical Symptoms.",2021-05-01,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE In 1995 intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IVRTPA) was the first reperfusion therapy to be approved in patients with acute ischaemic stroke (AIS). The significance and impact of IVRTPA in times of modern endovascular stroke treatment (EST) were analysed in a German academic stroke centre. METHODS A retrospective observational cohort analysis of 1034 patients with suspected AIS presenting at the emergency department in 2014 was performed. Patients were evaluated for baseline characteristics, reperfusion procedures, IVRTPA eligibility, clinical outcome, symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (sICH) and mortality. Data acquisition was part of an investigator-initiated, prospective and blinded end-point registry. RESULTS In 718 (69%) patients the diagnosis of symptomatic AIS was confirmed. 419 (58%) patients presented within 4.5 h of symptom onset and of those 260 (62%) received reperfusion therapy (IVRTPA alone, n = 183; combination or bridging therapy, n = 60; EST alone, n = 17). Subtracting cases with absolute contraindications for IVRTPA resulted in an effective thrombolysis rate of 82%. sICH occurred in two patients treated with IVRTPA alone (1.1%). The median door-to-needle interval was 30 min. Fifty (17%) non-EST eligible AIS patients presenting within 4.5 h without absolute contraindications did not receive IVRTPA mainly due to mild or regressive symptoms. Most of these untreated IVRTPA eligible patients (82%) were discharged with a good clinical outcome (modified Rankin Scale ≤ 2). CONCLUSIONS Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator remains the most frequently applied reperfusion therapy in AIS patients presenting within 4.5 h of onset in a tertiary stroke centre. An effective thrombolysis rate of over 80% can be achieved without increased rates of sICH.","Feda, S; Nikoubashman, O; Schürmann, K; Matz, O; Tauber, S C; Wiesmann, M; Schulz, J B; Reich, A",European journal of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.13831; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30317687/,264
79847,Higher Plasma Osteopontin Concentrations Associated with Subsequent Development of Chronic Shunt-Dependent Hydrocephalus After Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.,2021-01-09,"Polarized growth requires the integration of polarity pathways with the delivery of exocytic vesicles for cell expansion and counterbalancing endocytic uptake. In budding yeast, the myosin-V Myo2 is aided by the kinesin-related protein Smy1 in carrying out the essential Sec4-dependent transport of secretory vesicles to sites of polarized growth. Over-expression suppressors of a conditional myo2 smy1 mutant identified a novel F-BAR-containing RhoGAP, Rgd3, that has activity primarily on Rho3, but also Cdc42. Internally tagged Rho3 is restricted to the plasma membrane in a gradient corresponding to cell polarity that is altered upon Rgd3 over-expression. Rgd3 itself is localized to dynamic polarized vesicles that, while distinct from constitutive secretory vesicles, are dependent on actin and Myo2 function. In vitro Rgd3 associates with liposomes in a PIP2-enhanced manner. Further, the Rgd3 C-terminal region contains several phosphorylatable residues within a reported SH3-binding motif. An unphosphorylated mimetic construct is active and highly polarized, while the phospho-mimetic form is not. Rgd3 is capable of activating Myo2, dependent on its phospho-state and Rgd3 overexpression rescues aberrant Rho3 localization and cell morphologies seen at the restrictive temperature in the myo2 smy1 mutant. We propose a model where Rgd3 functions to modulate and maintain Rho3 polarity during growth.

Improper management of plastic waste may lead to various negative impacts on the environment, animals, and human health. However, adopting proper waste management and the right technologies, looking in a different perception of the current crisis would be an opportunity. About 40% of the plastic waste ended up in landfill, 25% incinerated, 16% recycled and the remaining 19% are leaked into the environment. The increase of plastic wastes and demand of plastic markets serve as a good economic indicator for investor and government initiative to invest in technologies that converts plastic waste into value-added product such as fuel and construction materials. This will close the loop of the life cycle of plastic waste by achieving a sustainable circular economy. This review paper will provide insight of the state of plastic waste before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

80407,The Role of Bronchoscopy in COVID-19.,2020-08-07,"Objective Normobaric (NH) and hypobaric hypoxia (HH) are associated with acute mountain sickness (AMS) and cognitive dysfunction. Only few variables, like heart-rate-variability, are correlated with AMS. However, prediction of AMS remains difficult. We therefore designed an expedition-study with healthy volunteers in NH/HH to investigate additional non-invasive hemodynamic variables associated with AMS. Methods Eleven healthy subjects were examined in NH (FiO2 13.1%; equivalent of 3.883 m a.s.l; duration 4 h) and HH (3.883 m a.s.l.; duration 24 h) before and after an exercise of 120 min. Changes in parameters of electrical cardiometry (cardiac index (CI), left-ventricular ejection time (LVET), stroke volume (SV), index of contractility (ICON)), near-infrared spectroscopy (cerebral oxygenation, rScO2), Lake-Louise-Score (LLS) and cognitive function tests were assessed. One-Way-ANOVA, Wilcoxon matched-pairs test, Spearman's-correlation-analysis and Student's t-test were performed. Results HH increased heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and CI and decreased LVET, SV and ICON, whereas NH increased HR and decreased LVET. In both NH and HH cerebral oxygenation decreased and LLS increased significantly. After 24 h in HH, 6 of 11 subjects (54.6%) developed AMS. LLS remained increased until 24 h in HH, whereas cognitive function remained unaltered. In HH, HR and LLS were inversely correlated (r = - 0.692; p < 0.05). More importantly, the rScO2-decrease after exercise in NH significantly correlated with LLS after 24 h in HH (r = - 0.971; p < 0.01) and rScO2 correlated significantly with HR (r = 0.802; p < 0.01), CI (r = 0.682; p < 0.05) and SV (r = 0.709; p < 0.05) after exercise in HH. Conclusions Both acute NH and HH altered hemodynamic and cerebral oxygenation and induced AMS. Subjects, who adapted their CI had higher rScO2 and lower LLS. Furthermore, rScO2 after exercise under normobaric conditions was associated with AMS at high altitudes.","Kammerer, Tobias; Faihs, Valentina; Hulde, Nikolai; Bayer, Andreas; Hübner, Max; Brettner, Florian; Karlen, Walter; Kröpfl, Julia Maria; Rehm, Markus; Spengler, Christina; Schäfer, Simon Thomas",Annals of occupational and environmental medicine,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40557-018-0276-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30479778/,264

Resurgences of COVID-19 have also been observed in many other countries. In Guangzhou, China, a small outbreak, involving less than 100 residents, emerged in March and April 2020, and comprehensive and near-real-time genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 was conducted. When the numbers of confirmed cases among overseas travelers increased, public health measures were enhanced by shifting from self-quarantine to central quarantine and SARS-CoV-2 testing for all overseas travelers. In an analysis of 109 imported cases, we found diverse viral variants distributed in the global viral phylogeny, which were frequently shared within households but not among passengers on the same flight. In contrast to the viral diversity of imported cases, local transmission was predominately attributed to two specific variants imported from Africa, including local cases that reported no direct or indirect contact with imported cases. The introduction events of the virus were identified or deduced before the enhanced measures were taken. These results show that the interventions were effective in containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and they ruled out the possibility of cryptic transmission of viral variants from the first wave in January and February 2020. Our study provides evidence and emphasizes the importance of controls for overseas travelers in the context of the pandemic and exemplifies how viral genomic data can facilitate COVID-19 surveillance and inform public health mitigation strategies.","Jia, Hong-Ling; Li, Peng; Liu, Hong-Jie; Zhong, Jia-Yong; Qin, Peng-Zhe; Su, Wen-Zhe; Zheng, Ying-Feng; Li, Kui-Biao; Zeng, Qing; Li, Jin-Hui; Li, Li-Zhong; Cao, Lan; Wu, Ji-Bin; Chen, Yi-Yun; Jia, Lei-Li; Song, Hong-Bin; Zhang, Qi-Wei; Yang, Guang; Jing, Chun-Xia; Bo, Xiao-Chen; Zhang, Zhou-Bin; Di, Biao; Xiao, Chuan-Le; Ni, Ming",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00079-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33952598/,264

Although presumed to induce T cell-mediated immunity, whether tumor elimination depends on bacteria-specific or tumor-specific immunity is unknown. Herein we show that BCG-induced bladder tumor elimination requires CD4 and CD8 T cells, although augmentation or inhibition of bacterial antigen-specific T cell responses does not alter the efficacy of BCG-induced tumor elimination. In contrast, BCG stimulates long-term tumor-specific immunity that primarily depends on CD4 T cells. We demonstrate that BCG therapy results in enhanced effector function of tumor-specific CD4 T cells, mainly through enhanced production of IFN-γ. Accordingly, BCG-induced tumor elimination and tumor-specific immune memory require tumor cell expression of the IFN-γ receptor, but not MHC class II. Our findings establish that a bacterial immunotherapy for cancer is capable of inducing tumor immunity, an antitumor effect that results from enhanced function of tumor-specific CD4 T cells, and ultimately requires tumor-intrinsic IFN-γ signaling, via a mechanism that is distinct from other tumor immunotherapies.","Antonelli, Anthony C; Binyamin, Anna; Hohl, Tobias M; Glickman, Michael S; Redelman-Sidi, Gil",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2004421117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680964/,264

This patient population is medically and physiologically complex and requires careful perioperative planning and management on the part of the anesthesiologist. This review will summarize anesthetic considerations for pre, intra, and postoperative management of patients undergoing transsphenoidal pituitary surgery. RECENT FINDINGS An endoscopic approach is favored for patients undergoing transsphenoidal pituitary surgery. Hemodynamic monitoring is important to maintain cerebral perfusion and avoid risk of bleeding; however, 'controlled' hypotension may have adverse effects. Multimodal analgesia is effective for the management of postoperative pain and may reduce the risk of postoperative complications, including respiratory depression and postoperative nausea and vomiting. SUMMARY Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery is a preferred approach for the surgical management of nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas with symptoms of mass effect and functioning adenomas that cannot be otherwise managed medically. Understanding tumor pathologies and systemic effects are essential for preoperative planning and providing safe anesthetic care during the perioperative period.","Esfahani, Kamilla; Dunn, Lauren K",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aco.0000000000001035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34269738/,264

82917,A case of Evans' syndrome secondary to COVID-19.,2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND The internet has become an important source of health information among people across the globe. However, the novel coronavirus outbreak has led to a broader dissemination of fake and misleading health information. While health professionals may be able to critically evaluate internet-based information, the skills at finding, appraising, and using COVID-19-related online information may be problematic for laypeople in low-income countries. The purpose of this study was to examine the digital literacy of lay consumers of online COVID-19-related information in Ghana. METHOD A cross-sectional survey was conducted among online health consumers across five regions in Ghana. Participants were conveniently recruited through social media, and the survey was based on the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHeals) and administered through Qualtricsxm software. We calculated the overall mean eHeals score to determine the literacy levels and performed descriptive statistics to describe the characteristics of the sample. Linear regression analysis was performed to determine the factors associated with respondents' digital literacy. RESULT Out of 700 respondents sent with a survey link, 325 responded (46.4 % response rate). The majority of the respondents were: younger than 31 years (M = 28.42, SD = 6.98), males (59.7 %), use the internet daily (94.4 %), engaged in social media activities (65 %), and frequently search the internet for information related to COVID-19. The overall eHealth literacy was quite high (M = 4.01, SD = 0.95), but respondents' scores on items 1 and 6 were relatively low. Sex, age, frequently searching the internet for COVID-19 information, using the internet for educational purposes, and having a little/adequate knowledge of COVID-19 was predictive of digital literacy. CONCLUSION The study revealed a high overall digital literacy as well as sex and age differences in literacy levels among online health consumers in Ghana. However, respondents' ability to locate COVID-19 related informaion and their skills in differentiating scientific from unscientific internet-based information remain relatively low. These findings offer useful insight that can inform the design of inclusive internet-based preventive resources that would be accessible and understandable to laypeople across all age groups and sexes in low-income countries.","Abdulai, Abdul-Fatawu; Tiffere, Al-Hashim; Adam, Fuseini; Kabanunye, Moses Musah",International journal of medical informatics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2020.104322; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33157342/,264

We aimed to understand perceived barriers and facilitators to the provision of digital sexual health services during the first months of the pandemic. METHODS An online survey and qualitative interviews with UK sexual healthcare professionals recruited online and via snowball sampling were conducted in May-July 2020. RESULTS Amongst 177 respondents (72% female, 86% White, mean age = 46, SD = 9), most utilised telephone and email as their main communication channels; however, their perceived effectiveness varied (94% and 66%, respectively). Most agreed that staff needed additional training (89%), the available technology was not adequate (66%) and health professionals were hesitant to provide online consultations (46%). They had positive attitudes towards digitalisation, improving service quality and cost-effectiveness but were concerned about exacerbating health inequalities. DISCUSSION The study identifies a need for clear guidelines and training around the use of digital tools as well as a demand for investment in hardware and software required for the provision of remote services. Future research needs to explore the acceptability, safety and effectiveness of various digital tools to narrow health inequalities in sexual health service users.","Lunt, Alexandria; Llewellyn, Carrie; Bayley, Jake; Nadarzynski, Tom",International journal of STD & AIDS,https://doi.org/10.1177/09564624211023018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34106016/,264

METHODS Validated in-vitro suspension virucidal assays were used. Test product was mixed with the test virus for 30-, 60- or 120- seconds, neutralized with sodium thiosulfate, serially diluted in dilution medium in a 96 well plate and incubated in a carbon dioxide incubator for 7 days. The 50% Tissue Culture Infectious Dose per mL was determined. RESULTS Two rinses, one oral spray and one fluoride toothpaste showed log reduction of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 ranging from 1.81 to 2.98 and of influenza A from 2.58 to 4.13, respectively, within 30 seconds of contact time; similar results were obtained at 60 seconds. Further, the Ultra Sensitive rinse showed 0.19, 0.75, 1.58, 1.75, 2.66 and 3.24 log reduction of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, human coronavirus 229E, rhinovirus type 14, adenovirus type 5, and herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2, respectively, within 30 seconds of contact time. CONCLUSION Stabilized chlorine dioxide containing ClōSYS® oral care products reduced the viral load of multiple viruses within 30 seconds.

Individuals in the population vary markedly on this trait, ranging from frequent and intense emotional reactions to minor challenges to little emotional reaction even in the face of significant difficulties. Although not widely appreciated, there is growing evidence that neuroticism is a psychological trait of profound public health significance. Neuroticism is a robust correlate and predictor of many different mental and physical disorders, comorbidity among them, and the frequency of mental and general health service use. Indeed, neuroticism apparently is a predictor of the quality and longevity of our lives. Achieving a full understanding of the nature and origins of neuroticism, and the mechanisms through which neuroticism is linked to mental and physical disorders, should be a top priority for research. Knowing why neuroticism predicts such a wide variety of seemingly diverse outcomes should lead to improved understanding of commonalities among those outcomes and improved strategies for preventing them.","Lahey, Benjamin B",The American psychologist,https://doi.org/10.1037/a0015309; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19449983/,264

This imaging is noninvasive and allows for the longitudinal monitoring of infection in living animals. We used this tool to characterize novel monoclonal antibodies that bind the conserved stalk domain of the viral hemagglutinin of H1 and H5 subtypes and protect mice from lethal disease.

86146,"Epidemiology of COVID-19 Outbreak in Japan, January-March 2020.",2020-04-30,"BACKGROUND The inclusion of pharmacists into general practices in Australia has expanded in recent years. This systematic review aimed to synthesise the literature of qualitative and quantitative studies, and identify the knowledge gaps, related to pharmacists working in general practice in Australia. METHODS This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. PubMed, EBSCOhost, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched from the inception of databases to January 2021. The search was focused on studies investigating general practice pharmacists in Australia. The quality of each study was appraised using the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool criteria. The narrative synthesis approach was utilised to describe data due to the heterogeneity among study designs and measures. RESULTS Twenty-five studies were included in this review. General practice pharmacists engaged in various non-dispensing patient care services, with medication management reviews being the primary activity reported. General practice pharmacists' characteristics and an environment with a willingness of collaboration were the notable influencing factors for successfully including pharmacists in general practices. Factors that posed a challenge to the adoption of general practice pharmacists were lack of funding and other resources, poorly defined roles, and absence of mentoring/training. CONCLUSION This review has summarised the characteristics, activities, benefits, barriers, and facilitators of including pharmacists in general practices in Australia. General practice pharmacists are well accepted by stakeholders, and they can engage in a range of patient-centred activities to benefit patients. There is a need for more robust research to explore the patient and economic outcomes related to clinical activities that a pharmacist can perform in general practice, as a foundation to developing an appropriate and sustainable funding model. The findings of this review will be beneficial for pharmacists, researchers, policymakers, and readers who wish to implement the role of general practice pharmacists in the future.","Sudeshika, Thilini; Naunton, Mark; Deeks, Louise S; Thomas, Jackson; Peterson, Gregory M; Kosari, Sam",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0258674; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34648595/,264

86597,Fullerene nanoparticles: a promising candidate for the alleviation of silicosis-associated pulmonary inflammation.,2020-08-18,"Fusion with, and subsequent entry into, the host cell is one of the critical steps in the life cycle of enveloped viruses. For Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the spike protein (S) is the main determinant of viral entry. Proteolytic cleavage of S exposes its fusion peptide (FP), which initiates the process of membrane fusion. Previous studies on the related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) FP have shown that calcium ions (Ca2+) play an important role for fusogenic activity via a Ca2+ binding pocket with conserved glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D) residues. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV FP share a high sequence homology and here, we investigated whether Ca2+ is required for MERS-CoV fusion by screening a mutant array in which E and D residues in the MERS-CoV FP were substituted with neutrally charged alanines (A). Upon verifying mutant cell surface expression and proteolytic cleavage, we tested their ability to mediate infection of pseudo-particles (PPs) on host cells in modulating Ca2+ environments. Our results demonstrate that intracellular Ca2+ enhances MERS-CoV WT PPs infection by approximately two-fold and that E891 is a crucial residue for Ca2+ interaction. Subsequent electron spin resonance (ESR) experiments revealed that this enhancement could be attributed to Ca2+ increasing MERS-CoV FP fusion-relevant membrane ordering. Intriguingly, isothermal calorimetry showed an approximate 1:1 MERS-CoV FP to Ca2+ ratio, as opposed to an 1:2 SARS-CoV FP to Ca2+ ratio, suggesting significant differences in FP Ca2+ interactions of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV FP despite their high sequence similarity.SignificanceMERS-CoV is a major emerging infectious disease with zoonotic potential and a reservoir in dromedary camels and bats. Since its first outbreak in 2012, the virus has repeatedly transmitted from camels to humans with 2,468 confirmed cases causing 851 deaths. To date, there are no efficacious drugs and vaccines against MERS-CoV, increasing its potential to cause a public health emergency. In order to develop novel drugs and vaccines, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms that enable the virus to infect host cells. Our data has found that calcium is an important regulator of viral fusion by interacting with negatively charged residues in the MERS-CoV FP region. This can guide therapeutic solutions to either block this calcium interaction and also repurpose already approved drugs for this use for a fast response to MERS-CoV outbreaks.","Straus, Marco R; Tang, Tiffany; Lai, Alex L; Flegel, Annkatrin; Bidon, Miya; Freed, Jack H; Daniel, Susan; Whittaker, Gary R",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00426-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32295925/,264

Outcomes based on primary tumor location after salvage hepatic radioembolization with Yttrium-90 resin microspheres (Y90) are not well studied. OBJECTIVE: To assess survival outcomes in patients with advanced chemorefractory mCRC treated with Y90 radioembolization, stratified by primary tumor location, and to explore potential factors predictive of survival. METHODS: A total of 99 patients with mCRC liver metastases progressive on systemic therapy treated with Y90 at a single center were retrospectively analyzed. In 89 patients, tumor response on first imaging follow-up (CT or MRI at 1.9 ± 0.9 months after Y90) was evaluated using RECIST. Overall survival (OS), post-Y90 OS, and hepatic progression-free survival (PFS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Outcomes, and associations of outcomes with tumor response, were compared between patients with left- and right-sided tumors. RESULTS: A total of 74 patients had left-sided colon cancer, and 25 patients had right-sided colon cancer. Median OS from the time of mCRC diagnosis was 37.2 months, median post-Y90 OS was 5.8 months, and median hepatic PFS was 3.3 months. Based on RECIST, progressive disease on first imaging follow-up was observed in 38 patients (43%) post-Y90 and was associated with shorter post-Y90 OS compared to disease control on first imaging follow-up (4.0 vs 10.5 months, p < .001). Patients with right-sided primaries showed decreased post-Y90 OS compared to patients with left-sided primaries (5.4 vs 6.2 months, p = .02). Right- and left-sided primaries showed no significant difference in RECIST tumor response, hepatic PFS, or extrahepatic disease progression (p > .05). Post-Y90 survival was significantly lower in patients with progressive disease than with disease control among left-sided primaries (4.2 vs 13.9 months, p < .001), though not for right-sided primaries (7.2 vs 3.3 months, p = .05). CONCLUSION: Right-sided primary tumor was independently associated with decreased survival in patients with chemorefractory mCRC after Y90 radioembolization, despite similar RECIST tumor response, hepatic PFS, and extrahepatic disease progression compared to those with left-sided primary tumors. CLINICAL IMPACT: Primary colon cancer location impacts outcomes after salvage Y90 radioembolization and may help guide patient selection.","Wu, Vincent; Li, Matthew D; Goodwin, J Scott; Wehrenberg-Klee, Eric P; Zurkiya, Omar; Kalva, Sanjeeva P; Ganguli, Suvranu",AJR.

Two major events have occurred in the past 18 months: COVID-19 pandemic, and the first world consensus conference on PT. Several innovative studies were published after the consensus conference. RECENT FINDINGS During COVID-19 pandemic PT activity decreased. COVID-19 in transplant recipients increases mortality rates, but data from kidney transplantation show that mortality might be higher in waitlisted patients.The world consensus conference provided 49 jury deliberations on the impact of PT on management of diabetic patients and 110 practice recommendations.Recent evidence demonstrates that PT alone is safe and effective, that results of simultaneous pancreas and kidney (SPK) remain excellent despite older recipient age and higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes, that use of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive donors into HCV-negative recipients is associated with good outcomes, and that use of sirolimus as primary immunosuppressant and costimulation blockade does not improve results of SPK. SUMMARY COVID-19 pandemic and the first world consensus conference on PT were major events. Although COVID-19 pandemic should not reduce PT activity in the future, a major positive impact on both volume and outcomes of PT is awaited from the proceedings of the world consensus conference.","Vistoli, Fabio; Kauffmann, Emanuele F; Boggi, Ugo",Current opinion in organ transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/mot.0000000000000900; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34101665/,264
87298,Anticoagulation After Stroke in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation.,2019,"Background The start of a new academic year in graduate medical education will mark a transition for postgraduate year 1 (PGY-1) residents from medical school into residency. The relocation of individuals has significant implications given the COVID-19 pandemic and variability of the outbreak across the United States, but little is known about the extent of the geographic relocation taking place. Objective We reported historical trends of PGY-1 residents staying in-state and those starting residency from out-of-state to quantify the geographic movement of individuals beginning residency training each year. Methods We analyzed historical data collected by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education in academic years 2016-2017, 2017-2018, and 2018-2019, comparing the locations of medical school and residency programs for PGY-1 residents to determine the number of matriculants from in-state medical schools and out-of-state medical schools. International medical school graduates (IMGs) were shown separately in the analysis and then combined with out-of-state matriculants. US citizens who trained abroad were counted among IMGs. Results The total number of PGY-1s increased by 10.3% during the 3-year time period, from 29 338 to 32 348. When combined, IMGs and USMGs transitioning from one state or country to another state accounted for approximately 72% of PGY-1s each year. Approximately 63% of USMGs matriculated to a residency program in a new state, and IMGs made up 24.6% to 23.1% of PGY-1s over the 3-year period. Conclusions Each year brings a substantial amount of movement among PGY-1s that highlights the need for policies and procedures specific to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Byrne, Lauren M; Holmboe, Eric S; Combes, John R; Nasca, Thomas J",Journal of graduate medical education,https://doi.org/10.4300/jgme-d-20-00627.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32879697/,264

METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients who underwent PCI in England between January 2017 and April 2020 in the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society database. RESULTS Forty-four hospitals reported PCI procedures for 126 491 patients. There were ≈700 procedures performed each week before the lockdown. After the March 23, 2020 lockdown (11th/12th week in 2020), there was a 49% fall in the number of PCI procedures after the 12th week in 2020. The decrease was greatest in PCI procedures performed for stable angina (66%), followed by non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (45%), and ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (33%). Patients after the lockdown were younger (64.5 versus 65.5 years, P<0.001) and less likely to have diabetes (20.4% versus 24.6%, P<0.001), hypertension (52.0% versus 56.8%, P=0.001), previous myocardial infarction (23.5% versus 26.7%, P=0.008), previous PCI (24.3% versus 28.3%, P=0.001), or previous coronary artery bypass graft (4.6% versus 7.2%, P<0.001) compared with before the lockdown. CONCLUSIONS The lockdown in England has resulted in a significant decline in PCI procedures. Fewer patients underwent PCI for stable angina. This enabled greater capacity for urgent and emergency cases, and a reduced length of stay was seen for such patients. Significant changes in the characteristics of patients towards a lower risk phenotype were observed, particularly for non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction, reflecting a more conservative approach to this cohort.","Kwok, Chun Shing; Gale, Chris P; Curzen, Nick; de Belder, Mark A; Ludman, Peter; Lüscher, Thomas F; Kontopantelis, Evangelos; Roebuck, Chris; Denwood, Tom; Burton, Tony; Hains, Julian; Deanfield, John E; Mamas, Mamas A",Circulation.

Materials and Methods: We enrolled 140 patients (194 limbs) who underwent RFA for varicose veins of lower extremities. Patients were divided into two groups; elderly patients (more than 75 years old, E-group, n=36) and young patients (under 75 years old, Y-group, n=104), and perioperative data were analyzed and compared between two groups. Results: In E-group, there were more than patients with hypertension, ischemic heart disease, malignant tumor, and cerebrovascular disease. A partial recanalization was observed in only one limb (0.6%) in Y-group. Endovenous heat induced thrombosis (EHIT) was identified four limbs (2.8%) in Y-group and two limbs (4.1%) in E-group. All EHITs were class 1 by Kabnick classification, and they disappeared within one month after interventions, without antithrombotic therapy. No other major complications were observed. There were no significantly differences for preoperative mean venous clinical severity scores (VCSS) (Y : E=4.84 : 4.47) and postoperative VCSS (Y : E=1.16 : 1.19, 0.35 : 0.58, 0.15 : 0.06, 0.05 : 0.06 at 1, 3, 6, 12 months after) in both groups.

Type of program or service: We present a case study of a participatory research collaboration between CALD community leaders and health behaviour change scientists during the COVID-19 crisis. The goal was to better understand the role of community leaders in shaping health behaviours in their communities and how that role might be leveraged for better health outcomes. METHODS This article is the culmination of a series of dialogues between CALD community and advocacy leaders, and health behaviour change scientists in July 2020. The academic authors recruited 12 prominent CALD community leaders, conducted five semi-structured dialogues with small groups, and worked with all participants to develop insights that were applicable to the many different CALD communities represented in the research collaboration. RESULTS Three key findings emerged: 1) partnerships between CALD leaders, communities and government are critical for effective health communication; 2) shifting behaviour requires moving beyond disseminating information to designing tailored solutions; and 3) the diverse needs and circumstances of people and communities must be at the centre of health communication and behaviour change strategies. LESSONS LEARNT The collaborative process we undertook in this study enabled us to identify key challenges experienced and solutions offered by CALD leaders in communicating health information throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Partnering with communities that are subject to health messaging can reduce inequalities in healthcare communication by enabling the development of strategies that help align human behaviour with the recommendations of health experts. This - along with sustained partnership and collaboration with CALD communities, understanding the cultural context, and the appropriate tailoring and delivery of communications - will ensure health-related messages are not lost in translation. The lessons provided in this paper are applicable not only to the current pandemic but also to post-pandemic social and economic recovery.","Wild, Abigail; Kunstler, Breanne; Goodwin, Denise; Onyala, Saturnino; Zhang, Li; Kufi, Marama; Salim, Wudad; Musse, Faduma; Mohideen, Mohamed; Asthana, Molina; Al-Khafaji, Mohammad; Geronimo, Mary Ann; Coase, Daniel; Chew, Erin; Micallef, Eddie; Skouteris, Helen",Public health research & practice,https://doi.org/10.17061/phrp3112105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33690789/,264

This study aimed to examine the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 and other variables on non-attendance rate at an out-patient clinic. METHODS Clinic attendance at the Department of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, Waikato Hospital, New Zealand, was assessed. For each appointment, the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 and other variables on non-attendance rate were analysed. RESULTS In total, 1963 appointments were scheduled, with 194 non-attendances (9.9 per cent). Patients who had their appointments confirmed beforehand were 10.0 times more likely to attend their appointment. Sex, socioeconomic status, ethnicity and age were found to impact non-attendance rate. CONCLUSION In New Zealand, coronavirus disease 2019 does not appear to be a barrier to out-patient clinic appointment attendance.

We collected dates of illness onset for primary cases and secondary cases for the first 18 secondary patients infected with SARS-Cov-2. Estimations of incubation period are based on a log-normal distribution while we assume a Gamma distribution for the serial interval. In both cases maximum likelihood estimator was applied to estimate main parameters. Of the total of 18 cases of local transmission analyzed, 17% occurred in the presymptomatic and asymptomatic phase. The mean incubation period for symptomatic patients is 7.9 days (95%CI: 4.6, 11.1) considering the full sample and 7.5 days (95%CI: 4.1, 10.9) if the sample is restricted to the most certain cases. The median is 6.1 and 5.8 days respectively. The point estimation for the mean serial interval is 6.8 days (95%CI: 4.0-9.6). or 5.5 days (95%CI: 2.8, 8.1) for most certain pairs. The estimated median serial intervals were 5.2 and 4.1 days respectively. Comparisons with foreign estimates show that incubation period and serial interval could be longer in Bahia Blanca city than in other regions.

RECENT FINDINGS CAP is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common CAP pathogen; however, microbial cause varies by geographic location and host factors. Identification of a microbial cause in CAP remains challenging - 30-65% of cases do not have a pathogen isolated. The use of molecular techniques in addition to culture, serology and urinary antigen testing has improved diagnostic yield. Scoring systems are useful for CAP prognostication and site of care decisions. Studies evaluating novel biomarkers including pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and procalcitonin suggest potential adjunctive roles in CAP prognosis. Guideline-based treatment for CAP has changed little in recent years. Effective and timely antimicrobial therapy is crucial in optimizing outcomes and should be based on local antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. Macrolides may have additional anti-inflammatory properties and a mortality benefit in severe CAP. Preventive strategies include immunization and modification of specific patient risk factors. SUMMARY CAP is common and causes considerable morbidity and mortality. A comprehensive approach including advanced diagnostic testing, effective and timely antimicrobial therapy and prevention is required to optimize CAP outcomes.","Remington, Leah T; Sligl, Wendy I",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcp.0000000000000052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24614242/,264
89215,Acute Ischemic Stroke in Patients With COVID-19: An Analysis From Get With The Guidelines-Stroke.,2021-03-17,"BACKGROUND COVID-19 has impacted persons with serious illness, including those with chronic, neurodegenerative conditions. While there are several reports on COVID-19's impact on inpatient palliative care, literature is limited about the impact on outpatient care which may be more relevant for these patients. AIM To generate a person-centered description of the impact of COVID-19 from the perspectives of patients living with neurodegenerative disease and caregivers to improve outpatient palliative care delivery. DESIGN This qualitative study used rapid analysis via matrix design to identify emergent themes related to participant perspectives on the challenges of COVID-19. Data sources included semi-structured interviews, open-ended survey responses, medical record documentation and participant-researcher communications. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS Data was collected from 108 patients with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease or related disorders and 90 caregivers enrolled in a multicenter, clinical trial of community-based, outpatient palliative care between March 20, 2020 and August 8, 2020 (NCT03076671). RESULTS Four main themes emerged: (1) disruptions to delivery of healthcare and other supportive services; (2) increased symptomatic and psychosocial needs; (3) increased caregiver burden; (4) limitations of telecommunications when compared to in-person contact. We observed that these themes interacted and intersected. CONCLUSIONS Patients and caregivers have unmet care needs because of the pandemic, exacerbated by social isolation. While telemedicine has helped improve access to healthcare, patients and caregivers perceive clear limitations compared to in-person services. Changes in society and healthcare delivery in response to COVID-19 highlight ongoing and novel gaps that must be addressed to optimize future outpatient palliative care for neurologic illness.","Macchi, Zachary A; Ayele, Roman; Dini, Megan; Lamira, Jensine; Katz, Maya; Pantilat, Steven Z; Jones, Jacqueline; Kluger, Benzi M",Palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/02692163211017383; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34006157/,264

89726,Rehabilitation of patients with COVID-19.,2020-08-15,"BACKGROUND Significant reductions in glucose control immediately post bariatric surgery in patients with longstanding poor glycemic control can lead to the paradoxical progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in susceptible individuals. Bariatric surgery results in dramatic and immediate diabetic control postoperatively. We aimed to systematically review the literature to assess the effect of bariatric surgery on DR. METHODS A comprehensive search of electronic databases (e.g., MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library) was completed. All randomized controlled trials, non-randomized comparison study, and case series were included. Inclusion criteria included English-speaking studies, enrolling ≥ 5 patients, and contained ophthalmological data on outcome of DR pre- and post bariatric surgery. Two independently reviewers screened abstracts, reviewed full text versions of all studies classified, and extracted data. All comparison studies included in the meta-analysis were assessed independently by two reviewers for methodological quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) tools. Disagreements were resolved by re-extraction, or third-party adjudication. Where possible and appropriate, a meta-analysis was conducted. RESULTS A total of 277 studies were identified using our search criteria for screening. Four primary studies (n = 148 patients) met our inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review. These included no randomized controlled trials and four non-randomized case series. Patients with no preoperative DR (n = 80), following bariatric surgery, an average of 92.5 ± 7.4 % remained disease free, while 7.5 ± 7.4 % of patients progressed to DR. Patients with diabetic retinopathy preoperatively (n = 68), following bariatric surgery, an average of 57.4 ± 18.5 % of patients had no change, 23.5 ± 18.7 % of patients had progression, and 19.2 ± 2.9 % of patients had improvement in their disease. CONCLUSIONS Progression of diabetic retinopathy is a significant issue postoperatively following bariatric surgery. Patients with a diagnosis of DR prior to surgery are at increased risk of further progression in their disease and should receive adequate counseling and evaluation prior to undergoing a surgical procedure. However, the few primary studies in this systematic review limit any conclusion. Further studies are needed to further evaluate these results.","Cheung, Douglas; Switzer, Noah J; Ehmann, David; Rudnisky, Christopher; Shi, Xinzhe; Karmali, Shahzeer",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-014-1539-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25515499/,264

This health gap between the most and least fortunate in our society is widening, driven by complex social determinants of health, as well as healthcare systems themselves. Physicians are not just well-qualified and well-placed to act as advocates for change, but have a moral duty to do so: to stand by silently is to be complicit. Following a workshop on health inequalities and medical training at the Royal College of Physicians Trainees Committee, we sought to examine how health inequalities could be addressed through changes to the medical education system. We discuss the arguments for reform in recruitment to medicine, and changes to undergraduate, postgraduate and continuing medical education in order to equip the profession to deliver meaningful improvements in health inequalities. We propose a population health credential as a mechanism by which specialists can gain additional skills to take on leadership roles addressing health inequalities, allowing them to support colleagues in public health and bring in specialty-specific knowledge and experience.","FitzPatrick, Michael Eb; Badu-Boateng, Charles; Huntley, Christopher; Morgan, Caitlin",Future healthcare journal,https://doi.org/10.7861/fhj.2020-0242; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33791453/,264

To date, there are no clinical studies comparing TB and other energy sources, such as standard electrosurgery (ES), ultrasonic coagulating shears (US) and electrothermal bipolar vessel sealers (EBVS) in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal resection (LCR). The aim of this study was to compare outcomes and costs in patients undergoing LCR with TB, US, EBVS, or ES for both benign and malignant colorectal diseases. METHODS This study is a retrospective analysis of a prospective database of patients undergoing LCR. Unselected consecutive patients who had the laparoscopic dissection conducted by using TB were compared with consecutive patients undergoing LCR with US, EBVS, or ES. RESULTS Mean operative time did not significantly differ between the groups (P = .947). Estimated blood loss was significantly higher in the ES group (P < .001). Device-related complications occurred in 2.5% of ES patients, in 2.5% of US patients, and in 5% of EBVS patients, while no complications occurred in TB patients (P = .768). No significant differences were observed in postoperative complication rates between the groups. Mean postoperative hospital stay was similar in the groups. Cost analysis showed no significant differences between US (1519.1 ± 303 €), EBVS (1474.4 ± 372.8 €), and TB (1474.3 ± 176.3 €) (P = .737). CONCLUSION This is the first clinical study comparing TB and other energy-based devices in LCR. They all appear to be equally safe and effective. Costs of surgery are very similar. Further large randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these data.","Allaix, Marco Ettore; Arezzo, Alberto; Giraudo, Giuseppe; Arolfo, Simone; Mistrangelo, Massimiliano; Morino, Mario",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

91085,"Biological reconstruction in the treatment of extremity sarcoma in femur, tibia, and humerus.",2020-07-02,"Clinically, bone destruction caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis was serious especially in patients with vitamin D (VD) deficiency. However, the role of VD in M. tuberculosis-induced bone destruction remains clear. In this context, we investigate the role of VD and vitamin D receptor (VDR) in the M. tuberculosis-induced bone destruction. First, we infected RAW264.7 and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) with Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (M. bovis BCG) in vitro. Then, we activated VDR through VD administration. TRAP and FAK staining, bone resorption assays, immunofluorescence staining, qPCR, and western blot were carried out. In vivo, the M. tuberculosis-induced osteolytic model on the murine skull was established and the μCT and histological analyses were performed. We found that VDR and TRAP were upregulated in bone tuberculosis tissue and proved that M. tuberculosis infection promoted osteoclastogenesis in RAW264.7 and BMMs. VD could inhibit osteoclasts differentiation, fusion, and bone resorption dose-dependently. However, when VDR was knocked down, the inhibitory effect of VD on osteoclasts disappeared. In mechanism, activation of VDR inhibits the phosphorylation of IκB α, thereby inhibiting NFκB signaling pathway and alleviating osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, in the skull osteolysis model, VD administration reduced osteolysis, but not in VDR-/- mice. Our study, for the first time, demonstrates that activation of VDR by VD administration inhibits M. tuberculosis-induced bone destruction. Our results reveal that VD and VDR are potential therapeutic targets for M. tuberculosis-induced bone destruction, and are of great clinical significance for the development of new therapeutic strategies.","Deng, Jiezhong; Yang, Yusheng; He, Jinyue; Xie, Zhao; Luo, Fei; Xu, Jianzhong; Zhang, Zehua",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202100135r; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046950/,264

91472,Cerebral oxygen saturation and autoregulation during hypotension in extremely preterm infants.,2021-04-20,"BACKGROUND Iodinated and gadolinium contrast agents pose some risk for certain pediatric patients, including allergic-like reactions, contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). Digital flat-panel detectors enhance image quality during angiography and might allow use of more dilute contrast material to decrease risk of complications that might be dose-dependent, such as CIN and NSF. OBJECTIVE To assess the maximum dilution factors for iodine- and gadolinium-based contrast agents suitable for vascular imaging with fluoroscopy and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) on digital flat-panel detectors in an animal model. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed selective catheterization of the abdominal aorta, renal artery and common carotid artery on a rabbit. In each vessel we performed fluoroscopy and DSA during contrast material injection using iodinated and gadolinium contrast material at 100%, 80%, 50%, 33% and 20% dilutions. An image quality score (0 to 3) was assigned by each of eight evaluators. Intracorrelation coefficient, paired t-test, one-way repeated analysis of variance, Spearman correlation and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were applied to the data. RESULTS Overall the image quality scores correlated linearly with dilution levels. For iodinated contrast material, the optimum cut-off level for DSA when a score of at least 2 is acceptable is above 33%; it is above 50% when a score of 3 is necessary. For gadolinium contrast material, the optimum cut-off for DSA images is above 50% when a score of at least 2 is acceptable and above 80% when a score of 3 is necessary. CONCLUSION Knowledge of the relationship between image quality and contrast material dilution might allow a decrease in overall contrast load while maintaining appropriate image quality when using digital flat-panel detectors.","Racadio, John M; Kashinkunti, Soumya R; Nachabe, Rami A; Racadio, Judy M; Johnson, Neil D; Kukreja, Kamlesh U; Patel, Manish N; Privitera, Mary Beth; Hales, Jasmine E; Abruzzo, Todd A",Pediatric radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00247-013-2723-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23736781/,264

The symptoms included fever, coughing, and breathing difficulties. A few patients with this infection may only have atypical symptoms, which could lead to a misdiagnosis and subsequently further facilitate the spread of the virus. CASE SUMMARY A 74-year-old female patient complained of severe diarrhea. She did not have fever, coughing, or breathing difficulties. A physical examination revealed no obvious positive signs. The patient had been hypertensive for more than 10 years. Her blood pressure was well controlled. On January 9, 2020, the patient's son visited a colleague who was later confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 and his first close contact with our patient was on January 17. The patient was first diagnosed with gastrointestinal dysfunction. However, considering her indirect contact with a SARS-CoV-2-infected individual, we suggested that an atypical pneumonia virus infection should be ruled out. A computed tomography scan was performed on January 26, and showed ground-glass nodules scattered along the two lungs, suggestive of viral pneumonia. Given the clinical characteristics, epidemiological history, and examination, the patient was diagnosed with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). CONCLUSION Our patient had atypical symptoms of COVID-19. Careful acquisition of an epidemiological history is necessary to make a correct diagnosis and strategize a treatment plan.","Li, Rui-Lin; Chu, Shu-Guang; Luo, Yu; Huang, Zhen-Hao; Hao, Ying; Fan, Cheng-Hui",World journal of clinical cases,https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v8.i7.1265; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32337201/,264

METHODS Collateral grade (American Society of Interventional and Therapeutic Neuroradiology/Society of Interventional Radiology) on baseline angiography was independently assessed, blind to other data, with statistical analyses delineating the relationship with clinical, laboratory, and imaging parameters. RESULTS Angiographic data on collaterals were available in 119 of 144 subjects (mean age, 67±12 years; 52% woman; median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, 18 [range, 8-28]). Worse collaterals were noted in subjects with elevated baseline blood glucose (P=0.013) and those with elevated baseline systolic blood pressure (P=0.039). Multivariate predictors of partial or worse collaterals included absence of prior hypertension (odds ratio, 4.049, P=0.012), smoking history (odds ratio, 3.822; P=0.013), and higher blood glucose (odds ratio, 1.017; P=0.022). Collaterals were strongly related to Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) at baseline (0-1: median 8 [3-10]; 2-9 [5-10]; 3-9 [7-10]; 4-9 [8-10]; P<0.001) and 24 hours (0-1: median 1 [0-5]; 2-6 [0-10]; 3-8 [0-10]; 4-8 [4-8]; P<0.001). Better collaterals were linked with Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b/3 reperfusion (P=0.019), better median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at day 7/discharge (P<0.001), and better day 90 modified Rankin Scale (P<0.001). Better collateral grade was associated with successful revascularization without symptomatic hemorrhage, mean 2.3 (95% confidence interval, 2.1-2.5) versus 1.9 (95% confidence interval, 1.7-2.2), P=0.021. CONCLUSIONS Better collaterals were associated with lower glucose, lower blood pressure, smaller baseline infarcts in SWIFT, and greater likelihood of successful revascularization without hemorrhage and good clinical outcomes.

Timely issues germane to pharmacists, including dependent and independent practice, provider status, and professional identity also contribute to the rationale that pharmacists, just like all other healthcare providers, should be classified by their professional identity. While use of the term ""mid-level"" provider to identify various practitioners may not seem consequential in today's healthcare environment, it is important to recognize that words do matter in attributing value, and the contributions of all healthcare providers should be recognized as equally important to the patient care team.","Moore, Gina D; Bradley-Baker, Lynette R; Gandhi, Nidhi; Ginsburg, Diane B; Hess, Karl; Kebodeaux, Clark; Lounsbery, Jody L; Meny, Lisa M; Tanner, Elizabeth K; Lin, Anne",American journal of pharmaceutical education,https://doi.org/10.5688/ajpe8556; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34301548/,264
93699,Successful use of i-gel™ in a patient with tracheal stenosis undergoing Montgomery t-tube insertion.,2013,"Background The COVID-19 infection outbreak has aroused increasing attention and affected thousands of people nationwide. The long incubation period, high infectious rate, varied manifestation, and absence of effective treatment make it difficult to manage the disease transmission. Objective The intended goals are to encourage efficient management of neurological and neurosurgical patients, resource utilization, and protecting the healthcare provider during the COVID-19 epidemic. Herein, we present a consensus statement from various centers in India. Methodology In addition to the literature review, recommendations were included from neurologists and neurosurgeons from various centers in India. Results Every patient presenting for treatment should be treated as a potential asymptomatic infected case. Patients should be categorized based upon the priority as acute (require immediate treatment/surgery within 24 h), sub-acute (requiring treatment within a maximum of 7-10 days), or chronic (requiring treatment within a month). Non-essential elective surgeries and outpatient clinics should be avoided after informing the patient(s). There is a high risk of aerosol dispersion during intubation and certain neurosurgical procedures particularly those involving drills and endoscopes. These procedures should be performed wearing full personal protective equipment. The workflow of the operating rooms should also be modified significantly. Minor modifications in personal and professional lifestyles and routine training to use the PPE will ensure efficient management of resources. Conclusion These recommendations could be used to mitigate the risks and reduce exposure to other patients, public, and healthcare staff.","Gupta, Prakamya; Muthukumar, N; Rajshekhar, V; Tripathi, Manjari; Thomas, Sanjeev; Gupta, Sunil Kumar; Lal, Vivek; Pal, Pramod; Abraham, Mathew; Behari, Sanjay; Paliwal, Vimal; Singh, Daljit; Pandey, Sanjay; Narasimhan, Lakshmi; Srinivas, Dwarakanath; Panda, Samhita; Kale, S S; Chandra, P Sarat",Neurology India,https://doi.org/10.4103/0028-3886.283130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32414996/,264

Studies to answer this clinical question are increasing in number, but all published data thus far are based on retrospective analyses with limited sample sizes. Thus, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Gastrointestinal Tract Cancer Group (GITCG) and the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG) Stomach Cancer Study Group (SCSG) initiated a collaboration to develop an optimal treatment strategy for LMGC. Before planning a prospective study, a questionnaire was sent out to the network members of both groups in June 2016 to clarify current common practice in each region. Sixty-seven sites from 17 countries in the EORTC network and 55 sites from Japan responded. According to the survey, for patients with resectable LMGC without extrahepatic metastases, preoperative chemotherapy followed by resection of both primary (if still in place) and liver lesions was the preferred option for both the synchronous and the metachronous setting. For patients with unresectable LMGC, most of the sites recommended chemotherapy only. In this article, the detailed results of this survey are reported, shedding light on current community practice, and a joint EORTC-JCOG strategy of investigation is delineated.","Kataoka, Kozo; Kinoshita, Takahiro; Moehler, Markus; Mauer, Murielle; Shitara, Kohei; Wagner, Anna Dorothea; Schrauwen, Stefanie; Yoshikawa, Takaki; Roviello, Franco; Tokunaga, Masanori; Boku, Narikazu; Ducreux, Michel; Terashima, Masanori; Lordick, Florian",Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10120-017-0696-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28150070/,264

Five online databases were searched from inception to January 2018 and screened by two independent reviewers. Primary research studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported injury rates in recreational, elite student, and/or professional dancers of any genre and measured individual dance exposure at the hour, event, or day level. Sixteen studies were included, with only three studies incorporating recreational dancers. Reported injury incidence rates were less than 5 injuries per 1,000 dance hours, however substantially different definitions and methods for measuring injury and dance exposure were used. Based on the current evidence there is not an identifiable difference in injury rate or characteristics between recreational, elite student, and professional dancers. However, there remains a lack of high quality comprehensive data available across levels and genres of dance participation, and greater focus on consistency and completeness of reporting in dance injury research is still required.","Vassallo, Amy Jo; Trevor, Bronwyn L; Mota, Liana; Pappas, Evangelos; Hiller, Claire E",Journal of sports sciences,https://doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2018.1544538; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30481111/,264
94684,The USPSTF Recommendation on Blood Pressure Screening: Making 2021 the Transformative Year in Controlling Hypertension.,2021-04-27,"BACKGROUND Government policies can strongly influence migrants' health. Using a Health in All Policies approach, we systematically reviewed evidence on the impact of public policies outside of the health-care system on migrant health. METHODS We searched the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases from Jan 1, 2000, to Sept 1, 2017, for quantitative studies comparing the health effects of non-health-targeted public policies on migrants with those on a relevant comparison population. We searched for articles written in English, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish, French, Spanish, or Portuguese. Qualitative studies and grey literature were excluded. We evaluated policy effects by migration stage (entry, integration, and exit) and by health outcome using narrative synthesis (all included studies) and random-effects meta-analysis (all studies whose results were amenable to statistical pooling). We summarised meta-analysis outcomes as standardised mean difference (SMD, 95% CI) or odds ratio (OR, 95% CI). To assess certainty, we created tables containing a summary of the findings according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. Our study was registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017076104. FINDINGS We identified 43 243 potentially eligible records. 46 articles were narratively synthesised and 19 contributed to the meta-analysis. All studies were published in high-income countries and examined policies of entry (nine articles) and integration (37 articles). Restrictive entry policies (eg, temporary visa status, detention) were associated with poor mental health (SMD 0·44, 95% CI 0·13-0·75; I2=92·1%). In the integration phase, restrictive policies in general, and specifically regarding welfare eligibility and documentation requirements, were found to increase odds of poor self-rated health (OR 1·67, 95% CI 1·35-1·98; I2=82·0%) and mortality (1·38, 1·10-1·65; I2=98·9%). Restricted eligibility for welfare support decreased the odds of general health-care service use (0·92, 0·85-0·98; I2=0·0%), but did not reduce public health insurance coverage (0·89, 0·71-1·07; I2=99·4%), nor markedly affect proportions of people without health insurance (1·06, 0·90-1·21; I2=54·9%). INTERPRETATION Restrictive entry and integration policies are linked to poor migrant health outcomes in high-income countries. Efforts to improve the health of migrants would benefit from adopting a Health in All Policies perspective.

95058,Endoscopic mucosal resection of large colonic laterally spreading tumors using a dedicated viscous solution for submucosal injection (ORISE gel): a short case series (with video).,2020-12-14,"BACKGROUND There is little evidence about how novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) affects pregnant women and their newborns. Comparisons with other members of the coronavirus family responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have been done to predict maternal and neonatal outcomes; however, more information is required to establish clinical patterns, disease evolution and pregnancy prognosis in this group of patients. METHODS This paper is reporting a series of 91 women diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and puerperium. The analysis showed that 40 patients developed pneumonia, bilateral in most cases, with a 46.2% rate of hospitalization and 4 patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. In confront with previous publications, we have found a higher rate of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) severe forms, even when compared to non-pregnant women with the same baseline characteristics. We have analyzed the demographic characteristics, pregnancy-related conditions and presenting symptoms to identify features that could determine which patients will need hospitalization because of COVID-19 (Group 1-G1) and those who not (Group 2-G2). We have found that obesity and Latin-American origin behave as risk factors: OR: 4.3; 95% CI: 1.4-13.2, and OR: 2.6; 95% CI: 1.1 - 6.2, respectively. Among the 23 patients that delivered with active SARS-CoV-2, the overall rate of cesarean section (CS) and preterm birth were 52.2% and 34.8%, respectively, but we observed that the rate of CS was even higher in G1 compared to G2: 81.8% versus 25%, p = .012. However, prematurity was equally distributed in both groups and only one preterm delivery was determined by poor maternal condition. There were no deaths among the patients neither their newborns. CONCLUSION In conclusion, the results of our cohort reveal that SARSC-CoV-2 infection may not behave as mild as suggested during pregnancy, especially when factors as obesity or Latin-American origin are present. No evidence of late vertical transmission was noticed but prematurity and high CS rate were common findings, although it is difficult to establish any causality between these conditions and COVID-19. Further evidence is required to establish if pregnancy itself can lead to severe forms of COVID-19 disease and whether risk factors for the general population are applicable to obstetric patients. Until larger studies are available, pregnant women should be monitored carefully to anticipate severe complications.","Barbero, Patricia; Mugüerza, Laura; Herraiz, Ignacio; García Burguillo, Antonio; San Juan, Rafael; Forcén, Laura; Mejía, Inmaculada; Batllori, Emma; Montañez, María Dolores; Vallejo, Paloma; Villar, Olga; García Alcazar, Diana; Galindo, Alberto","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2020.1793320; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32689846/,264
95228,Bispectral index as a predictor of unsalvageable traumatic brain injury.,2017,"BACKGROUND Donation after circulatory death (DCD) is current clinical practice to increase the donor pool. Deleterious effects on renal graft function are described for hypothermic preservation. Therefore, current research focuses on investigating alternative preservation techniques, such as normothermic perfusion. METHODS We compared continuous pressure-controlled normothermic ex vivo kidney perfusion (NEVKP) with static cold storage (SCS) in a porcine model of DCD autotransplantation. After 30 minutes of warm ischemia, right kidneys were removed from 30-kg Yorkshire pigs and preserved with 8-hour NEVKP or in 4°C histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution (SCS), followed by kidney autotransplantation. RESULTS Throughout NEVKP, electrolytes and pH values were maintained. Intrarenal resistance decreased over the course of perfusion (0 hour, 1.6 ± 0.51 mm per minute vs 7 hours, 0.34 ± 0.05 mm Hg/mL per minute, P = 0.005). Perfusate lactate concentration also decreased (0 hour, 10.5 ± 0.8 vs 7 hours, 1.4 ± 0.3 mmol/L, P < 0.001). Cellular injury markers lactate dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase were persistently low (lactate dehydrogenase < 100 U/L, below analyzer range; aspartate aminotransferase 0 hour, 15.6 ± 9.3 U/L vs 7 hours, 24.8 ± 14.6 U/L, P = 0.298). After autotransplantation, renal grafts preserved with NEVKP demonstrated lower serum creatinine on days 1 to 7 (P < 0.05) and lower peak values (NEVKP, 5.5 ± 1.7 mg/dL vs SCS, 11.1 ± 2.1 mg/dL, P = 0.002). The creatinine clearance on day 4 was increased in NEVKP-preserved kidneys (NEVKP, 39 ± 6.4 vs SCS, 18 ± 10.6 mL/min; P = 0.012). Serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin at day 3 was lower in the NEVKP group (1267 ± 372 vs 2697 ± 1145 ng/mL, P = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS Continuous pressure-controlled NEVKP improves renal function in DCD kidney transplantation. Normothermic ex vivo kidney perfusion might help to decrease posttransplant delayed graft function rates and to increase the donor pool.","Kaths, J Moritz; Echeverri, Juan; Chun, Yi Min; Cen, Jun Yu; Goldaracena, Nicolas; Linares, Ivan; Dingwell, Luke S; Yip, Paul M; John, Rohan; Bagli, Darius; Mucsi, Istvan; Ghanekar, Anand; Grant, David R; Robinson, Lisa A; Selzner, Markus",Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000001343; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27467537/,264

95500,A novel technique of axillary vein puncture involving peripherally inserted central venous catheters for a small basilic vein.,2018,"BACKGROUND Bipolar radiofrequency (RF) induced tissue fusion is believed to have the potential to seal and anastomose intestinal tissue thereby providing an alternative to current techniques which are associated with technical and functional complications. This study examines the mechanical and cellular effects of RF energy and varying compressive pressures when applied to create ex vivo intestinal seals. METHODS A total of 299 mucosa-to-mucosa fusions were formed on ex vivo porcine small bowel segments using a prototype bipolar RF device powered by a closed-loop, feedback-controlled RF generator. Compressive pressures were increased at 0.05 MPa intervals from 0.00 to 0.49 MPa and RF energy was applied for a set time period to achieve bowel tissue fusion. Seal strength was subsequently assessed using burst pressure and tensile strength testing, whilst morphological changes were determined through light microscopy. To further identify the subcellular tissue changes that occur as a result of RF energy application, the collagen matrix in the fused area of a single bowel segment sealed at an optimal pressure was examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). RESULTS An optimal applied compressive pressure range was observed between 0.10 and 0.25 MPa. Light microscopy demonstrated a step change between fused and unfused tissues but was ineffective in distinguishing between pressure levels once tissues were sealed. Non uniform collagen damage was observed in the sealed tissue area using TEM, with some areas showing complete collagen denaturation and others showing none, despite the seal being complete. This finding has not been described previously in RF-fused tissue and may have implications for in vivo healing. CONCLUSIONS This study shows that both bipolar RF energy and optimal compressive pressures are needed to create strong intestinal seals. This finding suggests that RF fusion technology can be effectively applied for bowel sealing and may lead to the development of novel anastomosis tools.","Arya, Shobhit; Hadjievangelou, Nancy; Lei, Su; Kudo, Hiromi; Goldin, Robert D; Darzi, Ara W; Elson, Daniel S; Hanna, George B",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-2935-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23572219/,264

Given the dramatic rise in EAC incidence and poor outcomes, much attention has focused on screening and surveillance in BE with a goal of identifying curable lesions and improving outcomes in patients with EAC. The limitations of current screening and surveillance strategies provide the necessary impetus to improve diagnostic accuracy and risk stratification of patients with BE. Biomarkers have the potential to predict risk of progression to cancer, identify patients most likely to respond to endoscopic eradication therapies, and ultimately influence patient management and outcomes. The goal of identifying such a biomarker or panel of biomarkers ready for clinical application remains elusive. This review highlights the recent advances in the field of biomarkers. It is increasingly being recognized that a single biomarker is suboptimal in accurate clinical risk stratification of individuals at highest risk for progression to cancer and an ideal risk stratification tool should include a panel of biomarkers in conjunction with clinical and endoscopic factors. Finally, we review advances in our screening strategies with use of Cytosponge, transnasal endoscopy, and tethered capsule endomicroscopy and surveillance strategies with use of advanced imaging techniques. Feasibility of these novel technologies for large population screening and surveillance needs to be assessed in future trials.","Jankowski, Meghan; Wani, Sachin",Current treatment options in gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11938-014-0040-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25567106/,264
96003,Outcome after stroke thrombolysis in patients >80 years treated within 3 hours vs >3-4.5 hours.,2017,"BACKGROUND Percutaneous ablation is a common treatment for colorectal liver metastasis (CLM). However, the effect of rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue (RAS) mutation on outcome after ablation of CLMs is unclear. METHODS Patients who underwent image-guided percutaneous ablation of CLMs from 2004 to 2015 and had known RAS mutation status were analysed. Patients were evaluated for local tumour progression as observed on imaging of CLMs treated with ablation. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was performed to determine factors associated with local tumour progression-free survival. RESULTS The study included 92 patients who underwent ablation of 137 CLMs. Thirty-six patients (39 per cent) had mutant RAS. Rates of local tumour progression were 14 per cent (8 of 56) for patients with wild-type RAS and 39 per cent (14 of 36) for patients with mutant RAS (P = 0·007). The actuarial 3-year local tumour progression-free survival rate after percutaneous ablation was worse in patients with mutant RAS than in those with wild-type RAS (35 versus 71 per cent respectively; P = 0·001). In multivariable analysis, negative predictors of local tumour progression-free survival were a minimum ablation margin of less than 5 mm (hazard ratio (HR) 2·48, 95 per cent c.i. 1·31 to 4·72; P = 0·006) and mutant RAS (HR 3·01, 1·60 to 5·77; P = 0·001).

METHODS Eighty consecutive patients undergoing RARP were investigated. The severity of atherosclerosis was evaluated by the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) before RARP. Patients were divided into two groups, the atherosclerotic group (CAVI ≥9.0) and the control group (CAVI <9.0). International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), quality of life (QOL) index, uroflowmetry, post-void residual urine volume (PVR), frequency-volume charts, and the 1-hr pad test were compared between the two groups. Assessments were performed before RARP, and then at 1, 3, and 6 months after RARP. RESULTS Preoperative subjective and objective parameters were not significantly different between the two groups. The voiding symptom score of the IPSS and the QOL index was significantly higher in the atherosclerotic group at 3 months after RARP (P = 0.035, P = 0.001, respectively). The maximum flow rate was consistently lower in the atherosclerotic group, reaching a significant difference at 6 months after RARP (P = 0.027). IPSS total and storage symptom scores, PVR, frequency, and urine loss were not significantly different between the groups after RARP. CONCLUSIONS Atherosclerosis delayed the improvement of both voiding symptoms and voiding function after RARP, leading to aggravation of QOL in the early postoperative period. Atherosclerosis may be a predictor of slower recovery from transient lower urinary tract dysfunction immediately after RARP. Neurourol.

96339,Assessment of Right Heart Function during Extracorporeal Therapy by Modified Thermodilution in a Porcine Model.,2020-07-08,"AIM The pathogenic process underlying the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not yet clear in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) who receive direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy and achieve sustained virological response (SVR). This study investigated two risk factors for HCC in these patients, specifically hepatic fibrosis and steatosis. METHODS A total of 355 patients in whom HCV was eradicated by DAAs were evaluated. Fibrosis and steatosis were assessed using transient elastography (TE) and the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP). Inverse probability weighting (IPW) was applied to patient age, sex, albumin-bilirubin, α-fetoprotein, history of HCC, TE, or CAP. RESULTS The 12-, 24-, and 36-month cumulative incidence rates of HCC were 0.9%, 2.4%, and 4.1%, respectively. Univariate analysis with Cox proportional hazards model showed that while a high TE value (≥10 kPa) was significantly associated with HCC development (hazard ratio [HR], 7.861; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.126-29.070; p=0.002), while CAP was not. Additionally, univariate analysis with Cox proportional hazards model adjusted by IPW showed that a high TE value was significantly associated with HCC development (HR, 3.980; 95% CI, 1.036-15.290; p=0.044), while CAP was not. The cumulative IPW-adjusted incidence of HCC rates at 12, 24, and 36 months were 0.0%, 0.5%, and 1.7%, respectively, in patients with a low TE value, and 2.5%, 5.1%, and 7.6%, respectively, in those with a high TE value.

METHODS Electronic patient records of 852 patients in 2020 and 1818 patients in 2019, attending the EED at a tertiary eye centre (University Hospitals of Leicester, UK) were analysed. Data was extracted over a 31-day period during: (study period 1 (SP1)) COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in UK (24th March 2020-23rd April 2020) and (study period 2 (SP2)) the equivalent 2019 period (24th March 2019-23rd April 2019). RESULTS A 53% reduction in EED attendance was noted during lockdown. The top three pathologies accounting for >30% of the caseload were trauma-related, keratitis and uveitis in SP1 in comparison to conjunctivitis, trauma-related and blepharitis in SP2. The overall number of retinal tears and retinal detachments (RD) were lower in SP1, the proportion of macula-off RD's (84.6%) was significantly (p = 0.0099) higher in SP1 (vs 42.9% in SP2). CONCLUSION COVID-19 pandemic related lockdown has had a significant impact on the range of presenting conditions to the EED. Measures to stop spread of COVID-19 such as awareness of hand hygiene practices, social distancing measures and school closures could have an indirect role in reducing spread of infective conjunctivitis. The higher proportion of macula-off RD and lower number of retinal tears raises possibility of delayed presentation in these cases. Going forward, we anticipate additional pressures on EED and other subspecialty services due to complications and associated morbidity from delayed presentations.","Poyser, Alicia; Deol, Sundeep S; Osman, Lina; Kuht, Helen J; Sivagnanasithiyar, Tharsica; Manrique, Roslyn; Okafor, Linda O; DeSilva, Ian; Sharpe, David; Savant, Vijay; Sarodia, Usman; Sarvananthan, Nagini; Chaudhuri, Ray; Banerjee, Somnath; Burns, Joyce; Thomas, Mervyn G",European journal of ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1177/1120672120974944; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33213198/,264

We hypothesized that stellate ganglion block (SGB) during surgery would preserve sleep after surgery and increase intraoperative regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) on the blocked side in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery. A randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial was conducted at the First Hospital of China Medical University from January 2016 to September 2016. Ninety-six patients who underwent radical breast cancer surgery requiring general anaesthesia were randomly assigned to one of two study groups: a control group that received a saline SGB and a block group that received a 0.25% ropivacaine hydrochloride SGB. The primary outcome measure was the postoperative sleep profile, which was assessed using the bispectral index on the first postoperative night. The secondary outcome measure was the intraoperative rSO2, monitored was throughout surgery using near-infrared spectroscopy. A total of 91 female patients (mean age: 45 years; range 24-51 years) were included in the study. The duration of sleep was significantly increased by 66.3 min in the ropivacaine-SGB group compared with the saline-SGB group. No differences in rSO2 were observed on either the left or right side of the patients in either group 50 min after anaesthesia induction. We conclude that ropivacaine-SGB combined with general anaesthesia might increase the first postoperative sleep duration without influencing the intraoperative rSO2 in female patients undergoing elective breast cancer surgery.

MMC was the first nonlethal anomaly to be treated by fetal surgery. Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that the primary cause of the neurologic deficit associated with MMC is not simply incomplete neurulation but rather chronic mechanical injury and amniotic fluid-induced chemical trauma that progressively damages the exposed neural tissue during gestation. Case series and a prospective, randomized study show that fetal surgery for MMC before 26 weeks' gestation may preserve neurologic function, reverse the hindbrain herniation of the CM-II and obviate the need for postnatal placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. However, these studies also demonstrate that fetal surgery is associated with significant maternal and fetal risks. Consequently, further research is warranted to further expand our understanding of the pathophysiology of MMC, to evaluate the long-term impact of in utero intervention and to refine the timing and technique of fetal MMC surgery.","Danzer, Enrico; Adzick, N Scott",Fetal diagnosis and therapy,https://doi.org/10.1159/000329785; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21849764/,264

Regular visits to a primary care doctor or diabetes specialist are warranted to maintain glycemic control, but for a myriad of reasons disparity populations may have difficulties receiving diabetes care. We seek to determine the feasibility of telehealth added to care as usual and secondarily to improve health outcomes (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c]) in NHB and H/L with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes managed with two or three noninsulin agents. METHODS Twenty-nine patients were randomized to monthly phone calls or weekly to biweekly telehealth visits. Feasibility outcomes were summarized descriptively for the telehealth arm. Differences scores for A1C level and surveys were computed between baseline and three months and compared across arms using a two-sample t test or Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS Patients in the telehealth arm completed a median of eight visits (IQR: 5, 8), and 53% of those in the telephone arm completed 100% of their calls. Change in HbA1c was greater for those in the telephone arm (-2.57 vs -2.07%, P = .70) but the mean baseline HbA1c was higher in the telephone group (11.1% vs 10.3%). Although the change in HbA1c was not statistically different across arms, it was clinically significant. CONCLUSIONS Augmenting care as usual with telehealth provided by telephone or tablet can be of benefit in improving glycemic control in NHB and H/L with type 2 diabetes. Larger studies need to explore this further.","Myers, Alyson; Presswala, Lubaina; Bissoonauth, Aditya; Gulati, Neha; Zhang, Meng; Izard, Stephanie; Kozikowski, Andrzej; Meyers, Kerry; Pekmezaris, Renee",Journal of diabetes science and technology,https://doi.org/10.1177/1932296820951784; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32865027/,264

From the whole search, 404 articles reviewed and 17 articles that fulfilled the inclusion criteria included in the analysis. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist was followed and Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal checklist used for assessing the quality. Risk of bias assessed using forest plot and Egger's regression test. Data were analyzed using STATA version 15 and Review Manager Software version 5.3. RESULTS The overall pooled proportion of poor treatment outcome and mortality was 17.86% and 15.13% respectively. The incidence density rate of poor treatment outcome and mortality was 10.41/1000 person-months and 9.28/1000 person-months respectively. Survival status and successful treatment outcomes were 76.97% and 63.82% respectively. HIV positivity, non-HIV comorbidities, clinical complications, extrapulmonary involvement, undernutrition, anemia, treatment delay, lower body weight, and older age were the predictors of poor treatment outcome.

Materials and Methods Alco-Squid 18 (75% Squid 18® mixed with 25% alcohol) (AS18) was compared to embolization with 96% alcohol alone and to embolization with Squid 18® (S18®) alone. An arteriovenous malformation (AVM) model was created in group 1 (n = 2). Each AVM model was then embolized with AS18 or S18® alone with evaluation of a ratio between the volume of embolic agent divided by the volume of the AVM (evaluated by CT). For group 2 (n = 5), each agent was tested on three different kidneys (upper pole kidney artery). Pre- and postinterventional CTs, angiographies, blood alcohol content dosages, and histological studies (3 months postintervention) were performed. Results AS18 has better distal distribution than S18® alone, both in the kidneys (mean capsule-S18® distance: 3.9 mm (±0.23) and mean capsule-AS18 distance: 2.3 mm (±0.11) (p=0.029) and in the AVM model. Histological exploration found a higher rate of tubular necrosis with AS18 compared with S18® alone and alcohol alone (3.78 ± 0.44 compared to 2.33 ± 1.22 (p = 0.012) and 1.22 ± 0.67 (p < 0 .0001)). The blood alcohol content was negligible in all cases. Conclusion AS18 can suggest a better distal sclerotic and embolic character as compared with S18® alone without systemic toxicity.","Hak, Jean-François; Tradi, Farouk; Bobot, Mickael; Brige, Pauline; Habert, Paul; Chopinet, Sophie; Haffner, Aurélie; Soulez, Gilles; Guillet, Benjamin; Vidal, Vincent",Radiology research and practice,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8831060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33163232/,264

The aim of this study was to reveal the characteristics and relationship of intradermal band-like lipomatous metaplasia and coexisting skin tumors. A total of 20 cases with intradermal band-like lipomatous metaplasia were retrieved from 10,992 archive cases between April 1997 and March 2020 at Hyogo Cancer Center, and subjected to a detailed clinicopathologic analysis. Nine (45%) patients had superficial variant basal cell carcinoma as a coexisting neoplasm. Eight (40%) patients had squamous cell carcinoma, 5 of which were in situ. The remaining 3 (15%) cases were invasive extramammary Paget disease. All 20 cases showed at least one of 3 signs of tumor regression, namely, partial loss of overlying neoplasia, significant inflammatory infiltrate under the tumor, and fibrosis around the tumor.

It is associated with significant mortality and increased healthcare resource utilization. There are few biological markers of delirium, perhaps related to the etiologic heterogeneity of the syndrome. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an optical topography system to measure changes in the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin ([oxy-Hb]) in the cerebral cortex. We examined whether altered cortical brain activity in delirious patients with end stage liver disease (ESLD) is detected by fNIRS. We found that the [oxy-Hb] change during the verbal fluency task (VFT) was reduced in patients with ESLD compared with healthy controls (HC) in the prefrontal and bi-temporal regions. The [oxy-Hb] change during the sustained attention task (SAT) was elevated in patients with ESLD compared to HC in the prefrontal and left temporal regions. Notably, [oxy-Hb] change in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during SAT showed a positive correlation with the severity of delirium. Our results suggest that [oxy-Hb] change in the prefrontal cortex during the sustained attention task measured with fNIRS might serve as a biological marker associated with delirium in ESLD patients.","Yoshimura, Atsushi; Goodson, Carrie; Johns, Jordan T; Towe, Maxwell M; Irvine, Esme S; Rendradjaja, Nada A; Max, Laura K; LaFlam, Andrew; Ledford, Emily C; Probert, Julia; Tieges, Zoë; Edwin, David H; MacLullich, Alasdair M J; Hogue, Charles W; Lindquist, Martin A; Gurakar, Ahmet; Neufeld, Karin J; Kamiya, Atsushi",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-10024-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28835678/,264

METHODS Consecutive patients with stroke who underwent CTA and then endovascular treatment for intracranial large artery occlusion were retrospectively reviewed. CTA-determined occlusion type was classified into truncal-type occlusion or branching-site occlusion and compared with digital subtraction angiography-determined occlusion type during endovascular treatment. Three rapidly- and readily-assessable pre-procedural findings (CTA-determined occlusion type, atrial fibrillation, and hyperdense artery sign), which may infer occlusion pathomechanism (embolic versus nonembolic) before endovascular treatment, were evaluated for association with SR success along with stroke risk factors and laboratory results. In addition, the predictive power of the 3 pre-procedural findings for SR success was compared with receiver operating characteristic curve analyses. RESULTS A total of 238 patients (mean age, 70.0 years; male patients, 52.9%) were included in this study. CTA-determined occlusion type corresponded adequately with digital subtraction angiography-determined occlusion type (P=0.453). Atrial fibrillation (odds ratio, 2.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-5.66) and CTA-determined branching-site occlusion (odds ratio, 8.20; confidence interval, 3.45-19.5) were independent predictors for SR success. For predicting SR success, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value for CTA-determined branching-site occlusion (0.695) was significantly greater than atrial fibrillation (0.594; P=0.038) and hyperdense artery sign (0.603; P=0.023). CONCLUSIONS CTA-determined branching-site occlusion was significantly associated with SR success. Furthermore, among the 3 rapidly- and readily-assessable pre-procedural findings, CTA-determined branching-site occlusion had the greatest predictive power for SR success.","Baek, Jang-Hyun; Kim, Byung Moon; Yoo, Joonsang; Nam, Hyo Suk; Kim, Young Dae; Kim, Dong Joon; Heo, Ji Hoe; Bang, Oh Young",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.117.018096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28864601/,264

Ivermectin is a broad-spectrum anti-parasitic drug used widely for the treatment of onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis. Apart from its anti-parasitic effect it also exhibits antiviral activity against a number of viruses both in vitro and in vivo. Hence, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the currently available data on the therapeutic potential of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 as add on therapy. A total of 629 patients were included in the 4 studies and all were COVID-19 RT-PCR positive. Among them, 397 patients received ivermectin along with usual therapy. The random effect model showed the overall pooled OR to be 0.53 (95%CI: 0.29 to0.96) for the primary outcome (all-cause mortality) which was statistically significant (P=0.04). Similarly, the random effect model revealed that adding ivermectin led to significant clinical improvement compared to usual therapy (OR=1.98, 95% CI: 1.11 to 3.53, P=0.02). However, this should be inferred cautiously as the quality of evidence is very low.

Overall survival rates remain low, and most studies indicate that around 1 out 10 will survive to 30 days. Among the strongest factors associated with survival in OHCA is first recorded rhythm amendable to defibrillation, early defibrillation and prompt initiation of Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Overall, CPR started prior to EMS arrival has repeatedly been shown to be associated with survival rates 2-3 times higher compared with no such initiation. The primary goal of CPR is to generate sufficient blood flow to vital organs, mainly the brain and heart, until restoration of spontaneous circulation can be achieved. Barriers to the initiation of CPR by bystanders in OHCA include fear of being incapable, causing harm, and transmission of infectious diseases. Partly due to these barriers, and low rates of CPR, the concept of CPR with compression only was proposed as a simpler form of resuscitation with the aim to be more widely accepted by the public in the 1990s. But how reliable is the evidence supporting this simpler form of CPR, and are the outcomes after CO-CPR comparable to standard CPR?","Riva, Gabriel; Hollenberg, Jacob",Journal of internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/joim.13260; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33527546/,264
101887,Few Adverse Cardiovascular Events among Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis Receiving Hydroxychloroquine: Are We Reassured?,2021-05-13,"Underutilization of effective screening is one driver of disparities in cervical cancer incidence and mortality. Consideration of patient preferences could help to improve screening rates in populations facing substantial barriers to preventive care. We conducted a systematic review of the literature on cervical cancer screening preferences among medically underserved patients in the United States. We searched six electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Scopus, CINAHL, and PsycINFO) for articles published through February 2019 [Prospero ID: CRD42019125431]. Among the forty-three articles included, 23 reported screening modality preferences, 11 reported preferences related to provider demographics and attributes, 6 reported screening scheduling and results delivery preferences, and 9 reported preferences related to health education and communication. This review demonstrates the wide variety of medically underserved patient preferences related to cervical cancer screening. It also draws attention to two key preference trends that emerged despite heterogeneity in study design, populations, and preference assessment. Consistent preferences for HPV self-testing over traditional Pap testing highlight a key potential mechanism for increasing cervical cancer screening uptake among medically underserved populations. Additionally, preferences for gender- and language-concordant providers underscore the need for continued efforts toward expanding diversity among medical professionals.","Biddell, Caitlin B; O'leary, Meghan; Wheeler, Stephanie B; Spees, Lisa P","Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",https://doi.org/10.1158/1055-9965.epi-20-0306; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32457182/,264
101995,Patent Ductus Arteriosus and Brain Volume.,2016,"Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) is currently raging in China. It has been proven that NCP can be transmitted from human to human and cause hospital infection, which seriously threatens surgical staffs and inpatients. Although colorectal surgery is not a front-line subject in the fight against the epidemic, but in this special situation, now it is a difficult task that with the premise of how to maximize the protection for patients and their families, health of medical staff, and the safety of wards and hospitals, we can provide the highest quality medical services to ensure the orderly development of previous clinical work. Referring to the ""Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme for NCP (Trial Version 4 and 5)"" and combining the actual practice situation in our hospital with the ""Summary of New Coronavirus Files of Shanghai Renji Hospital"", we summarize how to carry out the clinical practice of colorectal surgery under the situation of the prevention and control of the NCP epidemiology, meanwhile under such situation aiming the procedure of diagnose and treatment for emergency patients with colorectal tumor, we share the experiences of the diagnosis of colorectal tumor, the management of patients with colorectal cancer who are scheduled to be admitted for surgery, the protection of wards, the perioperative management. More importantly, we introduce in detail the operative management and perioperative management of colorectal surgery patients suspected or diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia, including prevention and control measures for medical staff, operating rooms and surgical instruments. The main points are as follows: (1) Multidisciplinary team (MDT) must be run through the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. The members include not only routine departments, but also respiratory department and infectious department. (2) Colonoscopy examination may cause cross infection of NCP to patients and doctors. Therefore, it is prior to examine the emergency cases and life-threatening patients (bleeding, obstruction, gastrointestinal foreign bodies, etc.). If the emergent patients (intestinal obstruction) with suspected or confirmed NCP, the surgeons must perform emergency surgery, and intestinal decompressive tube through colonoscopy is not recommended. (3) The colorectal cancer patients with suspected or confirmed NCP should be placed in the isolated room with separate medical devices, and the operative room with negative pressure (under-5 Pa) must be separated. All disposable medical items, body fluids and feces of the patients in perioperative periods must be unified disposed according to the medical waste standard. (4) The surgical medical workers who process colorectal cancer patients with NCP must be protected by three-level. After operation, the medical workers must receive medical observation and be isolated for 14 days. We hope our ""Renji experience"" will be beneficial to colleagues.","Luo, Y; Zhong, M",Zhonghua wei chang wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of gastrointestinal surgery,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn441530-20200217-00057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32084676/,264

Methods: We compared 15,531 adults (age 45 and older) across four U.S. regions. Descriptive analyses were conducted to assess health information seeking and use by year. The relationship between health information seeking or use and regional changes were assessed using binomial logistic regression. Binomial models were adjusted by socio-demographics, chronic conditions, and health information sources. Magnitude and direction of relationships were assessed using adjusted odds ratios (aORs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and p-values. Results: Only the Northeast region showed increases in health information seeking (3.8%) and use (4.5%) among older adults. However adjusted models showed those living in the Northeast were 28% less likely to use health information to maintain their health and 32% less likely to use health information to treat illness. Conclusion: As a result of the current pandemic, older adults are facing a growing burden from health care expenses. Inability to gather and use health information for personal safety or self care can potentially increase inequalities in health, especially for older adults without personal health care providers.","Mathis, Arlesia; Rooks, Ronica N; Wiltshire, Jacqueline",Gerontology & geriatric medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/2333721421997192; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33748338/,264

The objective of the study was to compare the sensitivities of three sampling methods for this purpose. One thousand participants (mean age, 63.1 +/- 17.8 years) were included. Of these, 550 were patients hospitalized for acute febrile lower respiratory tract infections and 450 were controls. Oropharyngeal swabs (OPS), nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), and nasopharyngeal washings (NPW) were obtained from each participant and were tested for 12 respiratory viruses by a multiplex hydrolysis probes-based quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Patients were defined as positive for a specific virus if the virus was identified by at least one sampling method. In all, 251 viruses were identified in 244 participants. For the detection of any virus, the sensitivity rates for OPS, NPS, and NPW were 54.2%, 73.3%, and 84.9%, respectively (for OPS versus NPS and NPW, P < 0.00001; for NPS versus NPW, P < 0.003). Maximal sensitivity was obtained only with sampling by all three methods. The same gradation of sensitivity for the three sampling methods was found when influenza viruses, coronaviruses, and rhinoviruses were analyzed separately. The three sampling methods yielded equal sensitivity rates for respiratory syncytial virus. We conclude that nasopharyngeal sampling has a higher rate of sensitivity than oropharyngeal sampling and that the use of NPW has a higher rate of sensitivity than the use of NPS with a rigid cotton swab for the identification of respiratory viruses in adults. Sampling by all three methods is required for the maximal detection of respiratory viruses.","Lieberman, David; Lieberman, Devora; Shimoni, Avi; Keren-Naus, Ayelet; Steinberg, Rachel; Shemer-Avni, Yonat",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00886-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19726607/,264

The objective was to estimate major bleeding risk and mortality among new users of antiplatelet drugs in real-world clinical practice. METHODS AND FINDINGS A population-based prospective cohort using the French national health data system (SNIIRAM), identified 69,911 adults living within five well-defined geographical areas, who were new users of antiplatelet drugs in 2013-2015 and who had not received any antithrombotics in 2012. Among them, 63,600 started a monotherapy and 6,311 a dual regimen. Clinical data for all adults referred for bleeding was collected from all emergency departments within these areas, and medically validated. Databases were linked using common key variables. The main outcome measure was time to major bleeding (GI, ICH and other bleedings). Secondary outcomes were death, and event-free survival (EFS). Hazard ratios (HR) were derived from adjusted Cox proportional hazard models. We used Inverse Propensity of Treatment Weighting as a stratified sensitivity analysis according to the antiplatelet monotherapy indication: primary prevention without cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, with CV risk factors, and secondary prevention. We observed 250 (0.36%) major haemorrhages, 81 ICH, 106 GI and 63 other types of bleeding. Incidences were twice as high in dual therapy as in monotherapy. Compared to low-dose aspirin (≤ 100 mg daily), high-dose (> 100 up to 325 mg daily) was associated with an increased risk of ICH (HR = 1.80, 95%CI 1.10 to 2.95). EFS was improved by high-dose compared to low-dose aspirin (1.41, 1.04 to 1.90 and 1.32, 1.03 to 1.68) and clopidogrel (1.30, 0.73 to 2.3 and 1.7, 1.24 to 2.34) respectively in primary prevention with and without CV risk factors. CONCLUSION The incidence of major bleeding and mortality was low. In monotherapy, low-dose aspirin was the safest therapeutic option whatever the indication.

OBJECTIVE This single centre cross-section study aimed to grade the severity of pneumonia by bed-side lung ultrasound (LUS). METHODS A scoring system discriminates 5 levels of lung opacities: A-lines (0 points),≥3 B-Line (1 point), coalescent B-Lines (2 points), marked pleural disruptions (3 points), consolidations (4 points). LUS (convex 1-5 MHz probe) was performed at 6 defined regions for each hemithorax either in supine or prone position. A lung aeration score (LAS, maximum 4 points) was allocated for each patient by calculating the arithmetic mean of the examined lung areas. Score levels were correlated with ventilation parameters and laboratory markers. RESULTS LAS of 20 patients with ARDS reached from 2.58 to 3.83 and was highest in the lateral right lobe (Mean 3.67). Ferritin levels (Mean 1885μg/l; r = 0.467; p = 0.051) showed moderate correlation in spearman roh calculation. PaCO2 level (Mean 46.75 mmHg; r = 0.632; p = 0.005) correlated significantly with LAS, while duration of ventilation, Horovitz-Index, CRP, LDH and IL-6 did not.

Existing digital support tools show promise but are not yet designed to optimize engagement or implementation. OBJECTIVE The goal of the research was to test acceptability and effects of an automated digital Mobile Support Tool for Mental Health (MoST-MH) for young adults transitioning to college. METHODS Youths aged 18 years and older with a current mental health diagnosis preparing to transition to college (n=52; 85% female [45/52], 91% White [48/52]) were recruited from a primary care (n=31) and a mental health clinic (n=21). Participants were randomized 2:1 to either receive MoST-MH (n=34) or enhanced Usual Care (eUC; n=18). MoST-MH included periodic text message and web-based check-ins of emotional health, stressors, negative impacts, and self-efficacy that informed tailored self-care support messages. Both eUC and MoST-MH participants received links to a library of psychoeducational videos and were asked to complete web-based versions of the Mental Health Self-Efficacy Scale (MHSES), College Counseling Center Assessment of Psychological Symptoms (CCAPS), and Client Service Receipt Inventory for Mental Health (C-SRI) monthly for 3 months and the Post-Study System Usability Scale (PSSUQ) at 3-months. RESULTS MoST-MH participants were sent a median of 5 (range 3 to 10) text message check-in prompts over the 3-month study period and 100% were completed; participants were sent a median of 2 (range 1 to 8) web-based check-in prompts among which 78% (43/55) were completed. PSSUQ scores indicate high usability (mean score 2.0). Results from the completer analysis demonstrated reductions in mental health symptoms over time and significant between-group effects of MoST-MH compared to eUC on depressive symptom severity (d=0.36, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.64). No significant differences in mental health self-efficacy or mental health health care use were observed. CONCLUSIONS In this pilot trial, we found preliminary evidence that MoST-MH was engaged with at high rates and found to be highly usable and reduced depression symptoms relative to eUC among youth with mental health disorders transitioning to college. Findings were measured during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the study was not powered to detect differences in outcomes between groups; therefore, further testing is needed.

Our analysis considers the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for health and indicators of economic progress in each country, as well as the impact of the global financial crisis on progress towards MDGs for communicable diseases in the region. The analysis indicates that the current focus of funding may need to be expanded to include less-discussed but high-burden diseases often related to inadequacies in the health sector and the particular development paths that countries pursue. Scarce funding during times of global economic recession could be used more effectively if informed by a careful analysis of the complex set of factors, including behavioural, environmental and health systems factors, that determine the burden of communicable diseases. Significant gaps in funding as well as varying regional needs warrant a more diverse set of national and international aid measures. Although regional and global collaboration is critical, the effectiveness of future policies to deal with the burden of communicable diseases in the region will only be assured if these policies are based on evidence and developed by policy-makers familiar with each country's needs and priorities.","Gupta, Indrani; Guin, Pradeep",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,https://doi.org/10.2471/blt.09.065540; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20428387/,264

METHODS Sixty patients underwent attempted B-II TLDG from 2011 through 2013. Patients who underwent B-II LADG prior to 2011 were matched to TLDG cases for demographics, comorbidities, tumor characteristics, and TNM stage. Perioperative and short-term surgical outcomes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS Clinicopathological characteristics of both groups were comparable. The B-II TLDG group had a shorter hospital stay (9.4 vs. 12.0 days, P = 0.038) and average incision size was smaller (3.5 vs. 5.4 cm, P = 0.030) than in the B-II LADG group. Anastomotic leakage was not recorded in either group, and there were no differences in the rates of perioperative complications and in inflammatory parameters between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that B-II TLDG is feasible, compared to B-II LADG, and that it has several advantages over LADG, including a smaller incision, a shorter hospital stay, and more convenience during surgery. However, prospective randomized controlled studies are still needed to confirm that B-II TLDG can be used as a standard procedure for LDG.","Kim, Ji-Hyun; Jun, Kyong-Hwa; Chin, Hyung-Min",BMC surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12893-017-0245-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28431531/,264

This study documents the experiences of an international group of 10 physiology educators surrounding this transition. They wrote reflective narratives, framed by guiding questions, to answer the research question: ""What were the changes to physiology laboratories in response to the COVID-19 pandemic?"" These narratives probed educators' attitudes toward virtual laboratories before, during, and after the transition to remote delivery. Thematic analysis of the reflections found that before COVID-19 only a few respondents had utilized virtual laboratories and most felt that virtual laboratories could not replace the in-person laboratory experience. In response to university lockdowns, most respondents transitioned from traditional labs to remote formats within a week or less. The most common remote delivery formats were commercially available online physiology laboratories, homemade videos, and sample experimental data. The main challenges associated with the rapid remote transition included workload and expertise constraints, disparities in online access and workspaces, issues with academic integrity, educator and student stress, changes in learning outcomes, and reduced engagement. However, the experience generated opportunities including exploration of unfamiliar technologies, new collaborations, and revisiting the physiology laboratory curriculum and structure. Most of the respondents reported planning on retaining some aspects of the remote laboratories postpandemic, particularly with a blended model of remote and on-campus laboratories. This study concludes with recommendations for physiology educators as to how they can successfully develop and deliver remote laboratories.","Choate, Julia; Aguilar-Roca, Nancy; Beckett, Elizabeth; Etherington, Sarah; French, Michelle; Gaganis, Voula; Haigh, Charlotte; Scott, Derek; Sweeney, Terrence; Zubek, John",Advances in physiology education,https://doi.org/10.1152/advan.00241.2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33861153/,264

The parameters such as log P value were determined experimentally and compared with predicted values. The pH-dependent aqueous solubility and stability were investigated following standard protocols at 25°C and 37°C. Drug solubility enhancement was attempted utilizing both surfactants and cyclodextrins (CDs), and the drug/CD complexation was studied employing various techniques such as differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance, and scanning electron microscopy. The experimental log P value suggested that the compound is fairly hydrophilic. Berberine chloride was found to be very stable up to 6 months at all pH and temperature conditions tested. Aqueous solubility of the drug was temperature dependent and exhibited highest solubility of 4.05 ± 0.09 mM in phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) at 25°C, demonstrating the effect of buffer salts on drug solubility. Decreased drug solubility was observed with increasing concentrations of ionic surfactants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide. Phase solubility studies demonstrated the formation of berberine chloride-HPβCD inclusion complex with 1:1 stoichiometry, and the aqueous solubility of the drug improved almost 4.5-fold in the presence of 20% HPβCD. The complexation efficiency values indicated that the drug has at least threefold greater affinity for hydroxypropyl-β-CD compared to randomly methylated-β-CD. The characterization techniques confirmed inclusion complex formation between berberine chloride and HPβCD and demonstrated the feasibility of developing an oral solution dosage form of the drug.","Battu, Sunil Kumar; Repka, Michael A; Maddineni, Sindhuri; Chittiboyina, Amar G; Avery, Mitchell A; Majumdar, Soumyajit",AAPS PharmSciTech,https://doi.org/10.1208/s12249-010-9520-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20842541/,264

Residencies must develop new strategies to provide patient care while ensuring the health and continued education of trainees. We aimed to describe the evolving impact of COVID-19 on orthopaedic surgery residents. METHODS We surveyed five Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited orthopaedic residency programs within cities highly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic about clinical and curricular changes. An online questionnaire surveyed individual resident experiences related to COVID-19. RESULTS One hundred twenty-one resident survey responses were collected. Sixty-five percent of the respondents have cared for a COVID-19-positive patient. One in three reported being unable to obtain institutionally recommended personal protective equipment during routine clinical work. All programs have discontinued elective orthopaedic cases and restructured resident rotations. Most have shifted schedules to periods of active clinical duty followed by periods of remote work and self-isolation. Didactic education has continued via videoconferencing.

106936,Prospective randomized trial of venous angioplasty in MS (PREMiSe).,2014,"OBJECTIVE The reliability of pulse oximetry in the lower SaO2-ranges has not been fully investigated. We wanted to investigate pulse oximeter performance in a pig model of perinatal asphyxia. METHODS Asphyxia was induced in 22 newborn pigs. Pulse oximetry-values for SpO2, as well as SaO2 from blood gas analyses were recorded multiple times before, during and after asphyxiation. The relationship between SpO2 and SaO2 in normoxia and hypoxia in this model was quantified. Calculations were made for 5% increments of SaO2 increasing successively from ≥95% to ≥20%. RESULTS The pigs became severely hypoxic, acidotic and hypotensive. The bias in the total data was +13.7 (p < 0.001), i.e. SpO2 was on average higher than SaO2 for the entire interval of SaO2. However, bias was not significantly different from zero in most SpO2-ranges. Accuracy and precision were considerably higher than stated by the manufacturer in all SpO2-ranges, with both accuracy and precision increasing when SpO2-values down to 60% and lower were included. CONCLUSION Pulse oximetry was less reliable at SaO2-values below 60%. Tissue acidosis and reduced peripheral perfusion may have contributed to this. It is unknown whether the difference between SpO2 and SaO2 is clinically relevant.","Solevåg, Anne Lee; Dannevig, Ingrid; Šaltytė-Benth, Jūratė; Saugstad, Ola D; Nakstad, Britt","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.3109/14767058.2013.842550; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24090354/,264

According to the results, an increase in the efficiency of sorption preparations containing Polysorbate 20 is based on an intensification of the bentonite aggregate disintegration into individual montmorillonite particles and a formation of more dense protective sorption layer providing a better protection of seeds against allelotoxins on the seed surface. The introduction of non-ionogenic surfactants into the preparation increases a sorption capacity of a bentonite-humus complex that results in a decreased gibberellin activity in a solution. Therefore, to achieve the maximum physiological activity of gibberellin in a preparation solution, it is necessary to increase its concentration from 100 to 300 mg/L.

To date, research on patient portals has been rapidly increasing. Our umbrella review aims to provide a meta-level synthesis to make sense of the evidence on patient portals from published systematic reviews (SRs). METHODS We will employ a modified version of the Joanna Briggs Institute umbrella review method. The search strategy encompasses multiple databases. The inclusion criterion is specific to SRs focused on patient portal. Patients or public were not involved in this work. ANALYSIS Two researchers will independently screen titles/abstracts and then full-text articles against the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Methodological quality of included reviews will be assessed and data will be extracted from the final selection of reviews. These reviews will be categorised into quantitative, qualitative and/or mixed-synthesis groups based on information about the design of primary studies provided in the reviews. Correspondingly, we will create quantitative, qualitative and/or mixed-synthesis Excel data-extraction tables. Within each table, data will be extracted with the reference to primary studies as reported in the reviews, and will be synthesised into themes and then a smaller number of findings/outcomes. Modified Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) and Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research (CERQual) tools will be applied to assess the strength of evidence at the level of each finding/outcome. The output of our umbrella review will consist of summary of findings tables and evidence profile tables. A narrative meta-level synthesis will be provided. We will use the clinical adoption meta-model as an organising framework. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION As an outcome of this review, we will create a guidance and roadmap to be used in a future Delphi study to gather feedback from Canadian eHealth stakeholders. We will also present at conferences and publish the final report. The umbrella review does not require ethical approval.

107813,Role of sST2 in Predicting Recurrence of Atrial Fibrillation after Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation.,2020-07-31,"BACKGROUND The kidney-brain interaction has been a topic of growing interest. Past studies of the effect of kidney function on intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) outcomes have yielded inconsistent findings. Although the second, main phase of the Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trial (INTERACT2) suggests the effectiveness of early intensive blood pressure (BP) lowering in improving functional recovery after ICH, the balance of potential benefits and harms of this treatment in those with decreased kidney function remains uncertain. STUDY DESIGN Secondary analysis of INTERACT2, which randomly assigned patients with ICH with elevated systolic BP (SBP) to intensive (target SBP<140mmHg) or contemporaneous guideline-based (target SBP<180mmHg) BP management. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS 2,823 patients from 144 clinical hospitals in 21 countries. PREDICTORS Admission estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) of patients were categorized into 3 groups based on the CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) creatinine equation: normal or high, mildly decreased, and moderately to severely decreased (>90, 60-90, and <60mL/min/1.73m(2), respectively). OUTCOMES The effect of admission eGFR on the primary outcome of death or major disability at 90 days (defined as modified Rankin Scale scores of 3-6) was analyzed using a multivariable logistic regression model. Potential effect modification of intensive BP lowering treatment by admission eGFR was assessed by interaction terms. RESULTS Of 2,623 included participants, 912 (35%) and 280 (11%) had mildly and moderately/severely decreased eGFRs, respectively. Patients with moderately/severely decreased eGFRs had the greatest risk for death or major disability at 90 days (adjusted OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.28-2.61). Effects of early intensive BP lowering were consistent across different eGFRs (P=0.5 for homogeneity). LIMITATIONS Generalizability issues arising from a clinical trial population. CONCLUSIONS Decreased eGFR predicts poor outcome in acute ICH. Early intensive BP lowering provides similar treatment effects in patients with ICH with decreased eGFRs.","Zheng, Danni; Sato, Shoichiro; Arima, Hisatomi; Heeley, Emma; Delcourt, Candice; Cao, Yongjun; Chalmers, John; Anderson, Craig S",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.ajkd.2016.01.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26948991/,264

STUDY DESIGN Cohort study in a single-center NICU from January 2012 to December 2017 (n = 1464). We assessed the impact of clinical practice changes including neonatal-nephrology rounds on the incidence of AKI. RESULTS AKI occurred in 318 neonates (22%). AKI occurred less frequently in those admitted after clinical practice changes (P < 0.001). After multivariable adjustment, clinical practice changes were associated with reduced odds of AKI (adjusted odds ratio, 0.31; 95% CI 0.22-0.44, P < 0.001). Provider reporting of AKI improved (P < 0.001) and more neonates were referred for nephrology follow-up (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Increased nephrology integration in the NICU was associated with decreased AKI incidence. While recognition of AKI improved, AKI remained poorly reported and nephrology AKI follow-up did not routinely occur. This study supports the importance of increased nephrology involvement in the NICU.","Starr, Michelle C; Kula, Alexander; Lieberman, Joshua; Menon, Shina; Perkins, Anthony J; Lam, Teresa; Chabra, Shilpi; Hingorani, Sangeeta",Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41372-020-0725-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32681064/,264
108450,Stroke prevention following modified endoscopic ablation and appendectomy for atrial fibrillation.,2016,"Contraction-level invariant surface electromyography pattern recognition introduces the decrease of training time and decreases the limitation of clinical prostheses. This study intended to examine whether a signal pre-processing method named frequency division technique (FDT) for online myoelectric pattern recognition classification is robust against contraction-level variation, and whether this pre-processing method has an advantage over traditional time-domain pattern recognition techniques even in the absence of muscle contraction-level variation. Eight healthy and naïve subjects performed wrist contractions during two degrees of freedom goal-oriented tasks, divided in three groups of type I, type II, and type III. The performance of these tasks, when the two different methods were used, was quantified by completion rate, completion time, throughput, efficiency, and overshoot. The traditional and the FDT method were compared in four runs, using combinations of normal or high muscle contraction level, and the traditional method or FDT. The results indicated that FDT had an advantage over traditional methods in the tested real-time myoelectric control tasks. FDT had a much better median completion rate of tasks (95%) compared to the traditional method (77.5%) among non-perfect runs, and the variability in FDT was strikingly smaller than the traditional method (p < 0.001). Moreover, the FDT method outperformed the traditional method in case of contraction-level variation between the training and online control phases (p = 0. 005 for throughput in type I tasks with normal contraction level, p = 0.006 for throughput in type II tasks, and p = 0.001 for efficiency with normal contraction level of all task types). This study shows that FDT provides advantages in online myoelectric control as it introduces robustness over contraction-level variations.","Tolooshams, Bahareh; Jiang, Ning",Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2017.00003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28220147/,264

The current study aimed to further characterize the change in neuropsychologists' professional practice, specifically related to teleneuropsychology (TNP) service provision, and also provide novel data regarding the impact of the pandemic on providers' emotional health. Method: This study surveyed 142 neuropsychologists between 3/30/2020 and 4/10/2020, who worked within a variety of settings (e.g., academic medical centers, general hospitals, Veterans Affairs medical centers, rehabilitation hospitals) across all four U.S. geographic regions. Mixed-model analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were conducted to assess for differences in neuropsychological practice (i.e., total number of patients and proportion of TNP seen per week) across time points (i.e., late February and early April) by practice setting and region. Descriptive statistics were conducted to describe respondents' perceptions of TNP, emotional responses to the pandemic, and perceptions of institutional/employers'/practices' responses. Results: Nearly all respondents (∼98%) reported making practice alterations, with ∼73% providing at least some TNP. Neuropsychologists across all settings and regions reported performing a higher proportion of TNP evaluations by April 2020. On average, respondents reported a medium amount of distress/anxiety related to COVID-19, which had a ""somewhat small impact"" on their ability to practice overall. Conclusions: The current study further elucidated neuropsychologists' provision of TNP services and offered initial data related to their emotional response to the pandemic. Future research is needed to examine the viability and sustainability of TNP practice.","Zane, Katherine L; Thaler, Nicholas S; Reilly, Shannon E; Mahoney, James J; Scarisbrick, David M",The Clinical neuropsychologist,https://doi.org/10.1080/13854046.2020.1863473; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33371799/,264
108458,Visualizing Acute Stroke Data to Improve Clinical Outcomes.,2015,"BACKGROUND Prescription opioids have substantial abuse potential. This study compared the positive subjective drug effects of a newly developed extended-release (ER) oxycodone (OC)/acetaminophen (acetyl-para-aminophenol [APAP]) formulation with those of immediate-release (IR) OC/APAP. METHODS This randomized, double-blind, active- and placebo-controlled, 7-way crossover study enrolled healthy volunteers who were recreational prescription opioid users. The protocol was approved by an institutional review board and all participants provided written informed consent. Participants received single doses of intact ER and IR OC/APAP 15/650 mg, intact ER and IR OC/APAP 30/1300 mg, crushed ER and IR OC/APAP 30/1300 mg, and placebo. Peak subjective effects (Emax), time to Emax, and area under the drug-effect curves for drug liking, drug high, and good drug effects were measured using visual analogue scales. Least squares means with 95% confidence interval were compared using analysis of variance. RESULTS Among completers (N = 55), intact ER OC/APAP produced delayed and lower peak effects versus IR OC/APAP. Comparing intact tablets, the drug liking Emax (least squares means [95% confidence interval]) was significantly lower for OC/APAP 30/1300 mg (76.4 [72.8 to 80.0]) than for IR OC/APAP 30/1300 mg (85.6 [81.9 to 89.2]; difference, -9.2 [-13.1 to -5.2]; P < 0.001). Similar results were observed for intact ER and IR OC/APAP (15 mg/650 mg). Crushing ER OC/APAP 30/1300 mg further delayed these effects compared with the same dose of crushed IR OC/APAP and intact ER OC/APAP. CONCLUSIONS Extended-release OC/APAP produced lower subjective drug effects than IR OC/APAP. Crushing ER OC/APAP further delayed onset of subjective effects compared with intact ER OC/APAP. The ER OC/APAP may be less attractive for abuse than IR OC/APAP.

The virus belongs to the β genus Coronavirus in the family Corornaviridae, and is closely related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing severe symptoms of pneumonia. The virus is transmitted through droplets, close contact, and other means, and patients in the incubation period could potentially transmit the virus to other persons. According to current observations, 2019-nCoV is weaker than SARS in pathogenesis, but has stronger transmission competence; it's mechanism of cross-species spread might be related with angiotensin-converting enzyme Ⅱ (ACE2), which is consistent with the receptor SARS-CoV. After the outbreak of this disease, Chinese scientists invested a lot of energy to carry out research by developing rapid diagnostic reagents, identifying the characters of the pathogen, screening out clinical drugs that may inhibit the virus, and are rapidly developing vaccines. The emergence of 2019-nCoV reminds us once again of the importance of establishing a systematic coronavirus surveillance network.

Inflammatory cytokines specific to early prognostication in this population have not been well studied. We evaluated whether novel inflammatory cytokines obtained from adults with IHCA helped predict favorable neurologic outcome. METHODS The study population included adults with IHCA who underwent ACLS-guided resuscitation between March 2014 and May 2019 at an academic tertiary medical center. Peripheral blood samples were obtained within 6, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours of IHCA and analysis of 15 cytokines were performed. The primary outcome of interest was presence of favorable neurologic outcome at hospital discharge, defined as a Glasgow Outcome Score of 4 or 5. RESULTS Of the 105 adults with IHCA studied, 27 (25.7%) were noted to have survival with a favorable neurologic outcome while 78 (74.3%) did not. Patients who survived with favorable neurologic outcome were more often men (88.9% vs 61.5%, p = 0.008) and had higher rates of ventricular tachyarrhythmias as their initial rhythm (34.6% vs 11.7%, p = 0.018). Levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-R1 within 6 or 24 hours were significantly lower in patients with favorable neurologic outcome compared with those who had unfavorable neurologic outcome. In multivariable analysis, IL-10 levels within 6 hours was the only independent predictor of favorable neurologic outcomes [odds ratio (OR) 0.895, 95% confidence interval 0.805-0.996, p = 0.041]. CONCLUSION In this contemporary observational study of adults with IHCA receiving ACLS-guided resuscitative and post-resuscitative care, inflammatory cytokines specific to early prognostication in adults with IHCA exist. Further larger scale studies examining the association of these inflammatory cytokines with prognosis are warranted.","Patel, Jignesh K; Sinha, Niraj; Hou, Wei; Shah, Rian; Qadeer, Asem; Tran, Linh; Parikh, Puja B; Parnia, Sam",Resuscitation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resuscitation.2020.12.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385467/,264

However, they may experience limited access to bilingual clinical resources due to reduced availability of bilingual practitioners, geographical constraints, and other difficulties. Telerehabilitation can improve access to bilingual clinical services for BWA and facilitate the delivery of specific language treatments at distance, but more evidence on its effectiveness and reliability is needed. This study aimed to determine the equivalence of effectiveness and reliability of a semantic treatment for word retrieval deficits in BWA delivered via telerehabilitation relative to in-person therapy. Methods: We examined the retrospective data of 16 BWA who received 20 sessions of therapy based on semantic feature analysis for word retrieval deficits in person (n = 8) or via telerehabilitation (n = 8). The two groups were comparable on age, years of education, time of post-stroke onset, aphasia severity, and naming ability in both languages. Treatment effectiveness (i.e., effect sizes in the treated and the untreated language, and change on secondary outcome measures) and reliability (i.e., clinician adherence to treatment protocol) were computed for each delivery modality and compared across groups. Results: Significant improvements were observed in most patients, with no significant differences in treatment effect sizes or secondary outcomes in the treated and the untreated language between the teletherapy group and the in-person therapy group. Also, the average percentage of correctly delivered treatment steps by clinicians was high for both therapy delivery methods with no significant differences between the telerehabilitation vs. the in-person modality. Discussion: This study provides evidence of the equivalence of treatment gains between teletherapy and in-person therapy in BWA and the high reliability with which treatment for word retrieval deficits can be delivered via telerehabilitation, suggesting that the essential treatment components of the intervention can be conducted in a comparable manner in both delivery modalities. We further discuss the benefits and potential challenges of the implementation of telerehabilitation for BWA. In the future, telerehabilitation may increase access to therapy for BWA with varying linguistic and cultural backgrounds, thus, offering a more inclusive treatment approach to this population.","Peñaloza, Claudia; Scimeca, Michael; Gaona, Angelica; Carpenter, Erin; Mukadam, Nishaat; Gray, Teresa; Shamapant, Shilpa; Kiran, Swathi",Frontiers in neurology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.589330; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34093382/,264
109819,Masks in COVID-19: let's unmask the evidence.,2020-10-15,"ABSTRACT Expectancies can shape pain and other experiences. Generally, experiences change in the direction of what is expected (i.e., assimilation effects), as seen with placebo effects. However, in case of large expectation-experience discrepancies, experiences might change away from what is expected (i.e., contrast effects). Previous research has demonstrated contrast effects on various outcomes, but not pain. We investigated the effects of strong underpredictions of pain on experienced pain intensity. Additionally, we assessed related outcomes including (certainty of) expectations, fear of pain, pain unpleasantness, autonomic responses, and trust. Healthy participants (Study 1: n=81, Study 2: n=123) received verbal suggestions that subsequent heat stimuli would be moderately or highly painful (correct prediction), mildly painful (medium underprediction; Study 2 only), or non-painful (strong underprediction). Both studies showed that participants experienced less intense pain upon strong underprediction than upon correct prediction (i.e., assimilation). Expected pain, fear of pain, and pain unpleasantness were generally also lowered. However, strong underprediction simultaneously lowered certainty of expectations and trust in the experimenter. Study 2 indicated that the effects of strong underprediction versus medium underprediction generally did not differ. Moreover, Study 2 provided some indications for reduced heart rate and skin conductance levels, but increased skin conductance responses upon strong underprediction. In conclusion, even strong underpredictions of pain can reduce pain (i.e., cause assimilation), although not significantly more than medium underpredictions. However, strong underpredictions can cause uncertainty and undermine trust. These findings suggest that healthcare providers may wish to be cautious with providing overly positive information about painful medical procedures.","Peerdeman, Kaya J; Geers, Andrew L; Della Porta, Delia; Veldhuijzen, Dieuwke S; Kirsch, Irving",Pain,https://doi.org/10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002199; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33470747/,264
110110,Beware of simple explanations.,2020-11-04,"PROBLEM Expert literature on communication practices with vaccine hesitant parents posits that a non-confrontational/participatory discussion with the parent would be the best approach to improve compliance. A prior literature review found limited evidence to recommend any particular face to face intervention other than to incorporate communication about vaccination effectiveness during an encounter. Hence, a systematic review was performed in an attempt to determine the most efficacious communication practices to use with parents with vaccination concerns. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Quantitative and qualitative studies written in English that assessed the communication framework/style of the provider-parent interaction and studies where provider communication was listed as an intervention were reviewed. SAMPLE Nine articles were included in the sample. RESULTS The majority of the studies were descriptive and qualitative in nature with only one randomized controlled trial. Five of the 9 studies utilized a descriptive cross-sectional design. Two main themes included message types recommended or given by the provider and message types that were requested by the parent. CONCLUSIONS Overall, findings showed that there is currently not enough information to definitively state the type of provider-parent communication style that should be employed to affect the parents' vaccination viewpoint. However, recurring themes of trust in the provider and a personalized provider-parent interaction were evident, which promotes a participatory type of interaction. IMPLICATIONS The literature indirectly supports providers engaging with vaccine hesitant parents in a more individualized, participatory format, though higher quality and more rigorous studies that focus specifically on provider-parent communication practices are needed.","Connors, John T; Slotwinski, Kate L; Hodges, Eric A",Journal of pediatric nursing,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedn.2016.11.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27863734/,264

The benefit of thrombectomy for them may be greatly reduced due to diminishing neuroplasticity and a larger number of medical comorbidities. To address this knowledge gap, we examined clinical and economic outcomes after mechanical thrombectomy in the ischaemic stroke population from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Our null hypotheses were that elderly patients (>80 years) would have a similar rate of inpatient mortality in comparison to their younger counterparts and incur a similar economic expense. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. SETTING A 20% stratified sample of US community hospitals within the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. PARTICIPANTS All patients from 2008 to 2010 with a primary diagnosis of ischaemic stroke that received mechanical thrombectomy were included. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was inpatient mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospital charges and length of stay. RESULTS Less than 1% of all ischaemic stroke cases (9300) were treated with mechanical thrombectomy. Of these, 18% involved patients over 80 years of age. The odds of inpatient mortality in elderly patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy were approximately twice that of their younger counterparts (OR1.993, p < 0.001). The elderly experienced no significant difference in hospital charges (p=0.105) and length of stay (p=0.498). CONCLUSIONS The odds of inpatient mortality after mechanical thrombectomy in patients over 80 years of age were twice that of their younger counterparts. This is consistent with the overall worse prognosis seen in the natural history of this age group. Studies to better identify patients that would benefit from endovascular mechanical thrombectomy may improve outcomes and reduce the gap currently observed in age stratifications.","Villwock, Mark R; Singla, Amit; Padalino, David J; Deshaies, Eric M",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004480; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24650806/,264

To assess the incidence of osteoporosis in patients with HBV-associated cirrhosis and relevant mechanisms. Methods A total of 80 hospitalized patients with HBV-associated cirrhosis and 80 healthy controls were enrolled. The levels of serum osteocalcin, total procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide, β-C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (β-CTX), and 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) was evaluated in the cirrhosis group. Results The BMDs of the lumbar spine (P<0.001) and hip joints (P=0.015) in the cirrhosis group were significantly lower than those in the controls. The incidence of osteoporosis in the cirrhosis group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P<0.001). Compared to the patients of the Child-Pugh grade A and B, the BMD of lumbar spine and 25(OH)D3 was significantly decreased in patients of grade C, while β-CTX was elevated. Patients in the cirrhosis group faced a higher risk of osteoporosis as compared to the controls(P<0.001). Conclusions Enhanced bone resorption accounted for increased risk of osteoporosis in severe cirrhosis. Thus, HBV-associated cirrhosis was a risk factor for osteoporosis.","Zhang, Yijin; Gao, Xuesong; Liu, Ting; Gao, Ping; Li, Hongjie; Liu, Nan; Gao, Lili; Wan, Gang; Zhang, Yaonan; Duan, Xuefei",African health sciences,https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v20i4.13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394221/,264
110965,Postoperative atrial fibrillation in non-cardiac and cardiac surgery: an overview.,2015,"Public health practitioners and researchers have used traditional medical databases to study and understand public health for a long time. Recently, social media data, particularly Twitter, has seen some use for public health purposes. Every large technological development in history has had an impact on the behaviour of society. The advent of the internet and social media is no different. Social media creates public streams of communication, and scientists are starting to understand that such data can provide some level of access into the people's opinions and situations. As such, this paper aims to review and synthesize the literature on Twitter applications for public health, highlighting current research and products in practice. A scoping review methodology was employed and four leading health, computer science and cross-disciplinary databases were searched. A total of 755 articles were retreived, 92 of which met the criteria for review. From the reviewed literature, six domains for the application of Twitter to public health were identified: (i) Surveillance; (ii) Event Detection; (iii) Pharmacovigilance; (iv) Forecasting; (v) Disease Tracking; and (vi) Geographic Identification. From our review, we were able to obtain a clear picture of the use of Twitter for public health. We gained insights into interesting observations such as how the popularity of different domains changed with time, the diseases and conditions studied and the different approaches to understanding each disease, which algorithms and techniques were popular with each domain, and more.","Edo-Osagie, Oduwa; De La Iglesia, Beatriz; Lake, Iain; Edeghere, Obaghe",Computers in biology and medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103770; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32502758/,264

MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-seven healthy adult volunteers participated in a randomized crossover study of undergoing sedation with propofol alone (P group) or with a combination of propofol and midazolam (PM group). In the P group, continuous infusion of propofol through a target-controlled infusion (TCI) pump was started with the target effect site (ES) concentration set at 1.2 μg/mL. In the PM group, participants received a bolus administration of midazolam 0.02 mg/kg simultaneously with the start of continuous infusion of propofol through a TCI pump with the target ES concentration set at 0.8 μg/mL. The variables measured included the bispectral index (BIS) value, tidal volume (VT), percutaneous arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), respiratory rate (RR), end-tidal carbon dioxide tension (ETCO2), estimated ES propofol concentration, and minute volume. RESULTS BIS value, VT, SpO2, and ETCO2 decreased after sedative administration in the 2 groups. RR increased in the 2 groups. These changes occurred sooner in the PM group than in the P group. The ratio of change in VT to change in BIS value decreased in the 2 groups and was markedly smaller in the PM group than in the P group. Ratios of changes in SpO2, RR, and ETCO2 to change in BIS value increased in the 2 groups and were larger in the PM group than in the P group. CONCLUSION Changes in respiratory dynamics occurred sooner in the PM group than in the P group. In the PM group, although VT began to decrease before the change in BIS value, the increase in RR caused the rate of decrease in SpO2 to be smaller than the rate of decrease in BIS value.","Hagiwara, Ayano; Matsuura, Nobuyuki; Ichinohe, Tatsuya",Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joms.2017.05.038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28672136/,264
111309,Tackling Dialysis Burden around the World: A Global Challenge.,2021-05-01,"This paper presents a comparison between the electroencephalogram (EEG) channels during scoliosis correction surgeries. Surgeons use many hand tools and electronic devices that directly affect the EEG channels. These noises do not affect the EEG channels uniformly. This research provides a complete system to find the least affected channel by the noise. The presented system consists of five stages: filtering, wavelet decomposing (Level 4), processing the signal bands using four different criteria (mean, energy, entropy and standard deviation), finding the useful channel according to the criteria's value and, finally, generating a combinational signal from Channels 1 and 2. Experimentally, two channels of EEG data were recorded from six patients who underwent scoliosis correction surgeries in the Pusat Perubatan Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (PPUKM) (the Medical center of National University of Malaysia). The combinational signal was tested by power spectral density, cross-correlation function and wavelet coherence. The experimental results show that the system-outputted EEG signals are neatly switched without any substantial changes in the consistency of EEG components. This paper provides an efficient procedure for analyzing EEG signals in order to avoid averaging the channels that lead to redistribution of the noise on both channels, reducing the dimensionality of the EEG features and preparing the best EEG stream for the classification and monitoring stage.","Al-Kadi, Mahmoud I; Reaz, Mamun Bin Ibne; Ali, Mohd Alauddin Mohd; Liu, Chian Yong",Sensors,https://doi.org/10.3390/s140713046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25051031/,264

MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review of 11 consecutive patients (M/F = 8:3, mean age = 76 years) who underwent computed tomography (CT)-guided thermal ablation for locally recurrent RCC after partial (72%, 8/11) or radical nephrectomy (28%, 3/11) with a mean time to recurrence of 48 months (range 2-156). Assessment of technical success, complication (peri- and post-procedural), oncological outcome and survival analysis were performed. Patient baseline and follow-up renal function surrogates including creatinine level (Cr) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were statistically compared. RESULTS Eleven biopsy-proven recurrent RCC measuring 1.4-3.9 cm (mean = 2.8 cm) were treated with CT-guided thermal ablation. Technical success was achieved in 100% (11/11) of the cases. There were no major complications except for one (9%) asymptomatic hemorrhage (Clavien-Dindo grade I complication). Complete response, local progression-free and overall survival rate were 91, 91 and 82% during the mean follow-up time of 2.5 years (range 0.1-7.1). Renal function was overall stable without significant change at 1 month and last follow-up (p = 0.21; GFR, p = 0.10; creatinine). CONCLUSIONS Image-guided percutaneous thermal ablation is a feasible, safe and effective for local recurrence after nephrectomy, representing a non-surgical alternative for unresectable disease.","Zhou, Wenhui; Herwald, Sanna E; Uppot, Raul N; Arellano, Ronald S",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-018-1976-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29721615/,264

METHODS This prospective, longitudinal, phase 4, multicenter study involved 652 patients who had implantation of the LBS system. The primary outcome was the percentage of subjects who had LBS explant over 5 years. The secondary outcomes included the rate of reoperations, clinical and biochemical measures, and patient-reported outcome measures over 5 years. RESULTS The study cohort consisted of 79.3% females with a mean age of 44 years and a mean BMI of 45.4 kg/m2 . The primary end point was met with an explant rate of 8.74% (95% CI: 6.6%-10.9%) at 5 years. The rates for completer-only analysis and imputed missing data analysis were 12.81% (95% CI: 9.7%-15.9%) and 12.85% (95% CI: 10.2%-15.5%), respectively. All were significantly lower than the historic rate of 39.4% (P < 0.001). There were 43 patients who required reoperations or revisions excluding explants (6.6%). A mean weight loss of 18.7% was maximally achieved by 2 years, and weight loss was maintained through to 5 years. All patient-reported outcomes showed improvement following LBS treatment throughout 5 years.

113280,A pilot study of viral load in stools of patients with COVID-19 and diarrhea.,2021-05-31,"BACKGROUND Neuroendocrine (NE) tumors pose a diagnostic challenge with the need to utilize a combination of biochemical analysis, standard cross-sectional imaging, and more recently, nuclear medicine scans such as (111)indium-pentetreotide scintigraphy (somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, SRS; OctreoScan, Covidien Imaging Solutions, Hazelwood, MO). In this study we sought to evaluate the clinical utility of scintigraphy in the diagnosis and management of patients with NE tumors at a major university hospital. METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients who underwent both (111)indium-pentetreotide scintigraphy and computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI) at a single institution between February 2001 and July 2008. Charts were reviewed for patient demographics, symptoms of NE disease, and results of biochemical testing, imaging studies, histopathologic diagnosis, and medical and/or surgical management. RESULTS One hundred forty-five patients received (111)indium-pentetreotide scintigraphy (SRS) and concurrent cross-sectional imaging (CT/MRI) over the 7-year period studied. In the evaluation of primary disease, 60 % of tumors were localized by anatomic imaging, significantly greater than the 15 % detection rate achieved by SRS. In the evaluation of recurrent disease, 61 % of NE tumors were localized by cross-sectional imaging, significantly greater than the 31 % detection rate of SRS. Scintigraphy identified disease foci not seen on CT/MRI in just 8 of 74 of the cohort with evidence of disease and only altered the surgical management in 3 of 74 cases. CONCLUSIONS Cross-sectional CT/MRI imaging is sufficient for the localization of NE tumors. (111)Indium-pentetreotide scintigraphy does not significantly alter the surgical management of patients with NE tumors, and we suggest that it be selectively reserved for patients with disease that is occult to cross-sectional imaging.","Shaverdian, Narek; Pinchot, Scott N; Zarebczan, Barbara; Gillis, Holly C; Schiro, Adam; Chen, Herbert",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-012-2617-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22941169/,264

METHODS This study included patients who underwent RAPN for lateral renal tumors between 2013 and 2019. Lateral tumors were defined as X of A factors in the RENAL nephrometry score. In total, 290 and 48 patients with TP and RP, respectively, were included in the analysis. To minimize the effects of selection bias, the following variables were adjusted using 1:1 propensity score matching: age, sex, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate, tumor size, and RENAL nephrometry score. RESULTS After matching, 48 patients were allocated to each group. The mean age was 55 years, and the mean preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 68-69 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean tumor size was 30-31 mm. The RP group had a shorter operative time (124 vs. 151 min, p = 0.0002), shorter console time (74 vs. 110 min, p < 0.0001), shorter warm ischemic time (14 vs. 17 min, p = 0.0343), lower estimated blood loss (EBL) (33 vs. 52 ml, p = 0.0002), and shorter postoperative length of hospital stay (PLOS) (3.3 vs. 4.0 days, p < 0.0001) than the TP group. The change in eGFR, incidence rate of perioperative complication, and positive surgical margin rate did not significantly differ between the two groups. CONCLUSION RP had better surgical outcomes, including shorter operative time, lower EBL, and shorter PLOS for lateral renal tumors, which may suggest that RP is the optimal approach for selected lateral renal tumors.","Takagi, Toshio; Yoshida, Kazuhiko; Kondo, Tsunenori; Kobayashi, Hirohito; Iizuka, Junpei; Okumi, Masayoshi; Ishida, Hideki; Tanabe, Kazunari",Journal of robotic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11701-020-01086-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32358741/,264

Conventional local therapies such as surgery and chemoradiation can significantly impact quality of life (QoL). There has been limited data published using stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) as primary treatment in previously unirradiated patients. We hypothesize that SBRT provides high rates of control while limiting toxicity. METHODS A total of 66 medically unfit previously unirradiated patients with HNC were treated with SBRT, consisting of 35-40 Gy to gross tumor volume and 30 Gy to clinical target volume in five fractions. RESULTS Median age was 80 years. Local control (LC) and overall survival (OS) at 1 year were 73% and 64%. Two patients experienced grade 3 toxicity. CONCLUSION SBRT shows acceptable outcomes with relatively low toxicity in previously unirradiated patients with HNC who are medically unfit for conventional treatment. SBRT may provide an aggressive local therapy with high rates of LC and OS while maintaining QoL.","Gogineni, Emile; Rana, Zaker; Vempati, Prashant; Karten, Jessie; Sharma, Anurag; Taylor, Peter; Pereira, Lucio; Frank, Douglas; Paul, Doru; Seetharamu, Nagashree; Ghaly, Maged",Head & neck,https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.26342; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691496/,264

We hypothesized that collateral status as assessed by the hypoperfusion intensity ratio could modify the association between time from stroke onset and FLAIR lesion intensity. METHODS From the AX200 for ischemic stroke trial, 141 patients had appropriate FLAIR, diffusion-weighted imaging, and perfusion-weighted imaging. In the region of nonreperfused core, we calculated voxel-based relative FLAIR (rFLAIR) signal intensity. The hypoperfusion intensity ratio was defined as the ratio of the Tmax >10 s lesion over the Tmax >6 s lesion volume. A hypoperfusion intensity ratio threshold of ≤0.4 was used to dichotomize good versus poor collaterals. We studied the interaction between collateral status on the association between time from symptom onset and FLAIR intensity. RESULTS Time from symptom onset was associated with the rFLAIR intensity in the region of nonreperfused core (B=1.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.1). We identified an interaction between this association and collateral status; an association was present between time and rFLAIR intensity in patients with poor collaterals (r=0.53), but absent in patients with good collaterals (r=0.17; P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS Our findings show that the relationship between time from symptom onset and rFLAIR lesion intensity depends on collateral status. In patients with good collaterals, the development of an rFLAIR-positive lesion is less dependent on time from symptom onset compared with patients with poor collaterals.","Wouters, Anke; Dupont, Patrick; Christensen, Soren; Norrving, Bo; Laage, Rico; Thomalla, Götz; Albers, Greg; Thijs, Vincent; Lemmens, Robin",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.115.012010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26917566/,264

METHODS From April 4 to July 3, 2020, in a single university hospital in Denmark, all parturient women and their partners were invited to participate in the study, along with their newborns. Participating women and partners had a pharyngeal swab and a blood sample taken at admission; immediately after delivery, a blood sample was drawn from the umbilical cord. The swabs were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by polymerase chain reaction, and the blood samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Full medical history and obstetric and neonatal information were available. RESULTS A total of 1,313 parturient women (72.5.% of all women admitted for delivery at the hospital in the study period), 1,188 partners, and 1,206 newborns participated in the study. The adjusted serologic prevalence was 2.6% in women and 3.5% in partners. Seventeen newborns had SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, and none had immunoglobulin M antibodies. No associations between SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and obstetric or neonatal complications were found (eg, preterm birth, preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, Apgar score, low birth weight, umbilical arterial pH, need for continuous positive airway pressure, or neonatal admission), but statistical power to detect such differences was low. Full serologic data from 1,051 families showed an absolute risk of maternal infection of 39% if the partner had antibodies. CONCLUSION We found no association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and obstetric or neonatal complications. Sixty-seven percent of newborns delivered by mothers with antibodies had SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. A limitation of our study is that we lacked statistical power to detect small but potentially meaningful differences between those with and without evidence of infection.","Egerup, Pia; Fich Olsen, Line; Christiansen, Ann-Marie Hellerung; Westergaard, David; Severinsen, Elin Rosenbek; Hviid, Kathrine Vauvert Römmelmayer; Kolte, Astrid Marie; Boje, Amalie Dyhrberg; Bertelsen, Marie-Louise Mathilde Friis; Prætorius, Lisbeth; Zedeler, Anne; Nielsen, Josefine Reinhardt; Bang, Didi; Berntsen, Sine; Ethelberg-Findsen, Jeppe; Storm, Ditte Marie; Bello-Rodríguez, Judith; Ingham, Andreas; Ollé-López, Joaquim; Hoffmann, Eva R; Wilken-Jensen, Charlotte; Krebs, Lone; Jørgensen, Finn Stener; Westh, Henrik; Jørgensen, Henrik Løvendahl; la Cour Freiesleben, Nina; Nielsen, Henriette Svarre",Obstetrics and gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000004199; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33116054/,264

METHODS Systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted after a thorough search of relevant studies from databases. Trials that have evaluated HCQ for COVID-19 treatment were recruited for statistical analysis with fixed- and random-effect models. RESULTS Nine trials involving 4,112 patients were included in present meta-analysis. It was seen that hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin (HCQ-AZI) combination regimen increased the mortality rate in COVID-19 (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.63-3.36) patients, however, it also showed benefits associated with the viral clearance in patients (OR 27.18, 95% CI 1.29-574.32). HCQ-alone when used as a therapy in COVID-19 did not reveal significant changes in mortality rate, clinical progression, viral clearance and cardiac QT prolongation. Subsequent subgroup analysis showed that HCQ treatment could decrease mortality rate and progression to severe illness in severely-infected COVID-19 patients (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.13-0.58). A lower risk of mortality rate was also noted in the stratified group of >14 days follow-up period (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.13-0.58) compared to ≦14 days follow-up period group that conversely showed an increased mortality rate (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.41-3.10). CONCLUSION Our results indicated that HCQ-AZI combination treatment increased mortality rate in COVID-19, but it also showed benefits associated with viral clearance in patients. HCQ-alone used for treatment has revealed benefits in decreasing the mortality rate among severely-infected COVID-19 group and showed potential to be used for COVID-19 treatment in long-term follow-up period group. Accordingly, more rigorous, large-scale and long follow-up period studies in patients with COVID-19 are needed.","Yang, Tzu-Han; Chou, Chian-Ying; Yang, Yi-Fan; Chien, Chian-Shiu; Yarmishyn, Aliaksandr A; Yang, Tzu-Ying; Liu, Cheng-Hsuan; Chang, Kao-Jung; Yang, Yi-Ping; Chang, Yuh-Lih",Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,https://doi.org/10.1097/jcma.0000000000000425; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32947506/,264

We conducted a systematic review to identify stakeholder perceptions of key symptoms and health domains to test as patient-reported performance measures in oncology. Stakeholders included cancer patients, caregivers, clinicians, and healthcare administrators. Standard review methodology was used, consistent with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched to identify relevant studies through August 2020. Four coders independently reviewed entries and conflicts were resolved by a fifth coder. Efficacy and effectiveness studies, and studies focused exclusively on patient experiences of care (e.g., communication skills of providers) were excluded. Searches generated 1813 articles and 1779 were coded as not relevant, leaving 34 international articles for extraction. Patients, caregivers, clinicians, and healthcare administrators prioritize psychosocial care (e.g., distress) and symptom management for patient-reported performance measures. Patients and caregivers also perceive that maintaining physical function and daily activities are critical. Clinicians and administrators perceive control of specific symptoms to be critical (gastrointestinal symptoms, pain, poor sleep).

SELECTION OF STUDIES The electronic search resulted in a total of 2,073 records. Titles and abstracts were reviewed by two authors (WPM, IDESB), who checked for duplicates using the pre-established criteria for screening (studies published in English without limitation regarding the date or the status of the publication). DATA COLLECTION Data extraction was performed in a standardized way, and the final eligibility was assessed by reading the full text of the articles. We retrieved data regarding the delivery of the potential cases of vertical transmission, as well as the main findings and conclusions of systematic reviews. DATA SYNTHESIS The 2,073 records were reviewed; 1,000 duplicates and 896 clearly not eligible records were excluded. We evaluated the full text of 177 records, and identified only 9 suspected cases of possible vertical transmission. The only case with sufficient evidence of vertical transmission was reported in France. CONCLUSION The risk of vertical transmission by SARS-CoV-2 is probably very low. Despite several thousands of affected pregnant women, we have identified only one case that has fulfilled sufficient criteria to be confirmed as a case of vertical transmission. Well-designed observational studies evaluating large samples are still necessary to determine the risk of vertical transmission depending on the gestational age at infection.","Barcelos, Ionara Diniz Evangelista Santos; Penna, Ivan Andrade de Araújo; Soligo, Adriana de Góes; Costa, Zelma Bernardes; Martins, Wellington Paula",Revista brasileira de ginecologia e obstetricia : revista da Federacao Brasileira das Sociedades de Ginecologia e Obstetricia,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1722256; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33860504/,264

However, there are enough researches that negates the positive impact of microfinance loans on spousal violence. Recognized as one of the most predominant social evils, violence against women is not only a violation of their human rights but also an act of exploitation and denial of freedom. In the present study, we have tried to investigate if microfinance loan takers experience more spousal violence as compared to their counterparts by analyzing the National Family Health Survey IV, 2015-16. Our results indicate that 40.8% of women microfinance participants experience spousal violence. Additionally, the likelihood of microfinance participants to experience spousal violence is much higher than the non-microfinance participants (odds ratio = 1.35, p value = .000). Microfinance programs are designed to increase the individual agencies of women participants, which, in turn, reduce the chances of them becoming victims of spousal violence. However, if the credit program participation induces the woman to be a victim of spousal violence together with becoming financially autonomous, then such hidden costs need to be taken into account while evaluating the effectiveness of the gendered policy design.","Sinha, Debashree; Kumar, Pradeep",Journal of interpersonal violence,https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260520957681; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32912006/,264

117125,Clinical sedation and bispectral index in burn children receiving gamma-hydroxybutyrate.,2012,"PURPOSE We aimed to detect possible differences in microwave ablation (MWA) volumes after different fluid preinjections using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MATERIALS AND METHODS MWA volumes were created in 50 cuboid ex vivo bovine liver specimens (five series: control [no injection], 10 mL water, 10 mL 0.9% NaCl, 10 mL 6% NaCl, and 10 mL 12% NaCl preinjections; n=10 for each series). The operating frequency (915 megahertz), ablation time (7 min), and energy supply (45 watts) were constant. Following MWA, two MR sequences were acquired, and MR volumetry was performed for each sequence. RESULTS For both sequences, fluid preinjection did not lead to significant differences in MWA ablation volumes compared to the respective control group (sequence 1: mean MWA volumes ranged from 7.0±1.2 mm [water] to 7.8±1.3 mm [12% NaCl] vs. 7.3±2.1 mm in the control group; sequence 2: mean MWA volumes ranged from 4.9±1.4 mm [12% NaCl] to 5.5±1.9 mm [0.9% NaCl] vs. 4.7±1.6 mm in the control group). The ablation volumes visualized with the two sequences differed significantly in general (P < 0.001) and between the respective groups (control, P ≤ 0.001; water, P < 0.001; 0.9% NaCl, P < 0.001; 6% NaCl, P ≤ 0.001; 12% NaCl, P < 0.001). The volumes determined with sequence 1 were closer to the expected ablation volume of 8 mL compared to those determined with sequence 2. CONCLUSION For the fluid qualities and concentrations assessed, there is no evidence that fluid preinjection results in larger coagulation volumes after MWA. Because ablation volumes determined by MRI vary with the sequence used, interventionalists should gain experience in how to interpret postinterventional imaging findings (with the MR scanner, sequences, and parameters used) to accurately estimate the outcome of the interventions they perform.","Collettini, Federico; Rathke, Hendrik; Schnackenburg, Bernhard; Thomas, Andreas; Albrecht, Liane; Suttmeyer, Britta; Jonczyk, Martin; Guettler, Felix; Teichgräber, Ulf; Kroncke, Thomas; Hamm, Bernd; de Bucourt, Maximilian",Diagnostic and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.5152/dir.2013.12189; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23846553/,264

We investigated the relationship of past-year medical and non-medical use of z-drugs with past-year: i) psychological distress; ii) medical use, non-medical use, and DSM-IV use disorder of Benzodiazepine (BZD) tranquilizers; iii) use and DSM-IV alcohol and marijuana use disorders, recreational drugs with a depressant effect on the central nervous system. METHODS Data came from the 2015-2017 NSDUH (n = 128,740). Participants aged 18+ were asked if they had used any Z-Drug medically or non-medically in the past year. We investigated the associations between the three-level z-drugs variable with psychological distress and BZD, alcohol, and marijuana variables in multinomial logistic regression models. RESULTS Past-year prevalences of z-drug use were 3.3% for medical and 0.5% for non-medical use. Medical and non-medical users of z-drugs had higher risk of psychological distress, compared to non-users. Medical and non-medical users of z-drugs had higher risk of medical use, non-medical use, and BZD use disorders. Compared to non-users of z-drugs, medical users had higher risk of marijuana and alcohol use and alcohol use disorders, while non-medical users had higher risk of marijuana use and marijuana use disorders and alcohol. CONCLUSION Z-drug users have elevated risk of use and dependence of BZDs and recreational drugs, possibly due to concurrent prescribing and self-medication.","Tardelli, V S; Fidalgo, T M; Martins, S S",Addictive behaviors,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2020.106606; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818728/,264
117325,Antithrombotic Treatment after Transcatheter Heart Valves Implant.,2018,"Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic there has been much debate in the media on whether masks should be worn to stop the spread of the virus. There are two ways in which they could work. Firstly, to protect the person wearing the mask, and secondly, to reduce the likelihood of the person wearing the mask passing the disease on to anyone else. This is not an easy issue to address and many factors come into play such as droplet size, aerosol transmission and the viral load, as well as the specific properties of any given mask. The method used in this study was to measure the change in relative humidity when wearing a mask, compared to no mask, in various scenarios, based on the assumption that as the virus is air-borne the smaller the increase in humidity the less the spread of the virus. The results above show that the use of a mask, excluding some simple home-made ones, significantly reduces the spread of humidity. However, their effectiveness is device specific and needs to be considered in greater detail for each type of mask, especially the direction of escaping air when forward flow is blocked.","Swain, Ian D",Journal of medical engineering & technology,https://doi.org/10.1080/03091902.2020.1797198; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32716230/,264

The Pipeline™ Embolization Device has shown high rates of complete occlusion in uncontrolled clinical series. METHODS The study is a prospective, controlled, randomized, multicenter, phase 2 open-label trial. Intention-to-treat population includes age ≥18, unruptured saccular aneurysm located in the intra-dural area, neck diameter ≥4 and ≤10 mm, sac diameter ≥7 mm and ≤20 mm, ""dome/neck"" ratio is ≥1, diameter of the parent artery ≥2 mm and ≤5 mm, and no prior treatment of the aneurysm. Site can only participate if five patients have been previously treated with the Pipeline device. The primary end point of the study is complete occlusion of the aneurysm on angiogram performed 12 months after the endovascular procedure. Complete aneurysm occlusion is defined as the absence of visible blood flow, grade 1 according to the Raymond scale for the standard procedure group and grade 4 according to the grading scale of Kamran for the flow diverter group. RESULTS The trial is currently enrolling and results of the data are pending the completion of enrollment and follow-up.

Close collaboration of cardiologists and stroke physicians is critical to ensure optimum utilisation of short- and long-term care and preventive measures in patients with stroke. Risk factor management is an important strategy that requires cardiologic involvement for primary and secondary stroke prevention. Treatment of stroke generally is led by stroke physicians, yet cardiologists need to be integrated care providers in stroke units to address all cardiovascular aspects of acute stroke care, including arrhythmia management, blood pressure control, elevated levels of cardiac troponins, valvular disease/endocarditis, and the general management of cardiovascular comorbidities. Despite substantial progress in stroke research and clinical care has been achieved, relevant gaps in clinical evidence remain and cause uncertainties in best practice for treatment and prevention of stroke. The Cardiovascular Round Table of the European Society of Cardiology together with the European Society of Cardiology Council on Stroke in cooperation with the European Stroke Organisation and partners from related scientific societies, regulatory authorities and industry conveyed a two-day workshop to discuss current and emerging concepts and apparent gaps in stroke care, including risk factor management, acute diagnostics, treatments and complications, and operational/logistic issues for health care systems and integrated networks.

METHODS In this prospective observational study in adult comatose patients treated by therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest we measured bispectral index (BIS) during the first 24 hours of intensive care unit stay. A blinded neurological outcome assessment by cerebral performance category (CPC) was done 6 months after cardiac arrest. RESULTS Forty-six patients (48%) had a good neurological outcome at 6-month, as defined by a cerebral performance category (CPC) 1-2, and 50 patients (52%) had a poor neurological outcome (CPC 3-5). Over the 24h of monitoring, mean BIS values over time were higher in the good outcome group (38 ± 9) compared to the poor outcome group (17 ± 12) (p<0.001). Analysis of BIS recorded every 30 minutes provided an optimal prediction after 12.5h, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.89, a specificity of 89% and a sensitivity of 86% using a cut-off value of 23. With a specificity fixed at 100% (sensitivity 26%) the cut-off BIS value was 2.4 over the first 271 minutes. In multivariable analyses including clinical characteristics, mean BIS value over the first 12.5h was a predictor of neurological outcome (p = 6E-6) and provided a continuous net reclassification index of 1.28% (p = 4E-10) and an integrated discrimination improvement of 0.31 (p=1E-10). CONCLUSIONS Mean BIS value calculated over the first 12.5h after ICU admission potentially predicts 6-months neurological outcome after cardiac arrest.","Stammet, Pascal; Collignon, Olivier; Werer, Christophe; Sertznig, Claude; Devaux, Yvan",Resuscitation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resuscitation.2014.09.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25260721/,264

The majority of symptomatic patients have intermittent claudication and only a minority (<2% and typically those with diabetes mellitus or renal failure) progress to critical limb ischaemia, heralded by the onset of rest pain and/or tissue loss. Imaging is largely reserved for patients with disabling symptoms in whom revascularisation is planned. In these patients, accurate depiction of the vascular anatomy is critical for clinical decision making as the distribution and severity of disease are key factors determining whether revascularisation should be by endovascular techniques or open surgery. Driven by advances in technology, non-invasive vascular imaging has recently undergone significant refinement and has replaced conventional digital subtraction angiography for many clinical indications.

Health professional education has the potential to be an important aspect of falls prevention interventions. This scoping review was designed to investigate the extent of falls prevention education interventions available for health professionals, and to determine the quality of reporting. METHOD A five stage scoping review process was followed based on Arksey and O'Malley's framework and refined by the Joanna Briggs Institute Methodology for JBI Scoping Reviews. Five online databases identified papers published from January 2008 until May 2019. Papers were independently screened by two reviewers, and data extracted and analysed using a quality reporting framework. RESULTS Thirty-nine publications were included. Interventions included formal methods of educational delivery (for example, didactic lectures, video presentations), interactive learning activities, experiential learning, supported learning such as coaching, and written learning material. Few studies employed comprehensive education design principles. None used a reporting framework to plan, evaluate, and document the outcomes of educational interventions. CONCLUSIONS Although health professional education is recognised as important for falls prevention, no uniform education design principles have been utilised in research published to date, despite commonly reported program objectives. Standardised reporting of education programs has the potential to improve the quality of clinical practice and allow studies to be compared and evaluated for effectiveness across healthcare settings.","Shaw, L; Kiegaldie, D; Farlie, M K",BMC geriatrics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-020-01819-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33167884/,264

Methods: An online survey of psychological and sleep by using Questionnaire Star program from 5th to 19th February 2020 was conducted. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised was used to assess COVID-19 outbreak-related stress symptoms. Meanwhile, Questionnaires of Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Insomnia Severity Index were respectively used to assess the severity of anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: A total of 3 134 subjects were included. Among the included subjects, 15.5% (487), 24.9% (779), 28.7% (899) and 30.9% (968) of the subjects had COVID-19-related stress symptoms, anxiety, depression and insomnia after the COVID-19 outbreak, respectively. The severity levels of anxiety, depression and insomnia were significantly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to prior to the outbreak (all P<0.01). Furthermore, the subjects' stress response to the COVID-19 outbreak was an independent risk factor for increased anxiety, depression and insomnia after the outbreak. Conclusion: The COVID-19 outbreak resulted in related stress response and widespread increase in anxiety, depression, and insomnia outside Hubei Province, China in the general population. The aggravation of anxiety, depression and insomnia is associated with stress levels. Our data demonstrate that the widespread psychological and insomnia problems in the general population need to be addressed at the early phase of the pandemic.","Sun, Q M; Qin, Q S; Chen, B X; Shao, R F; Zhang, J S; Li, Y",Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112137-20200302-00557; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33238672/,264
119151,"""Subintimal external crush"" technique for a ""balloon uncrossable"" chronic total occlusion.",2017,"PURPOSE During radiotherapy the peritumoral tissues are daily exposed to subtherapeutic doses of ionizing radiation. Herein, the biological and molecular effects of doses lower than 0.8 Gy per fraction (LDIR), previously described as angiogenesis inducers, were assessed in human peritumoral tissues. MATERIAL AND METHODS Paired biopsies of preperitoneal adipose tissue were surgically collected from 16 patients diagnosed with locally advanced rectal cancer who underwent neo-adjuvant radiotherapy. One of the biopsies is located in the vicinity of the region where the tumor received the prescribed dose of radiation, and thus exposed to LDIR; the other specimen, outside all beam apertures, was used as an internal calibrator (IC). Microvessel density (MDV) was quantified by immunohistochemistry and the expression of several pro-angiogenic genes was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR using exclusively endothelial cells (ECs) isolated by laser capture microdissection microscopy. RESULTS LDIR activated peritumoral ECs by significantly up-regulating the expression of several pro-angiogenic genes such as VEGFR1, VEGFR2, ANGPT2, TGFB2, VWF, FGF2, HGF and PDGFC. Accordingly, the MVD was significantly increased in peritumoral tissues exposed to LDIR, compared to the IC. The patients that yielded a larger pro-angiogenic response, also showed the highest MVD. CONCLUSIONS LDIR activate ECs in peritumoral tissues that are associated with increased MVD. Although the technological advances in radiotherapy have contributed to reduce the damage to healthy tissues over the past years, the anatomical regions receiving LDIR should be taken into account in the treatment plan report for patient follow-up and in future studies to correlate these doses with tumor dissemination.","Gil Marques, Filipa; Poli, Esmeralda; Malaquias, João; Carvalho, Tânia; Portêlo, Ana; Ramires, Afonso; Aldeia, Fernando; Ribeiro, Ruy Miguel; Vitorino, Emília; Diegues, Isabel; Costa, Luís; Coutinho, João; Pina, Filomena; Mareel, Marc; Constantino Rosa Santos, Susana",Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2019.06.035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31376927/,264

All three ORFs were expressed with C-terminal eGFP and 3xFLAG tags in different cell lines and their localisation was determined. ORF 3a is predicted to contain DNA-binding and transcription activator domains, and it is localised in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. ORF 3b is also predicted to contain DNA-binding and activator domains, and was found to localise in the mitochondrion. Besides that, in some of the non-infected and FIPV-infected cells nucleolar, perinuclear or nuclear membrane accumulation of the eGFP-tagged 3b was observed. The exact compartmental localisation of ORF 3c is yet to be determined. However, based on our co-localisation studies 3c does not seem to be localised in the ER-Golgi network, ERGIC or peroxisomes. The expression of 3c-eGFP is clearly cell type dependent, it is more stable in MARC 145 cells than in Fcwf-4 or CrFK cells, which might reflect in vivo stability differences of 3c in natural target cells (enterocytes vs. monocytes/macrophages).","Mészáros, István; Olasz, Ferenc; Kádár-Hürkecz, Enikő; Bálint, Ádám; Hornyák, Ákos; Belák, Sándor; Zádori, Zoltán",Acta veterinaria Hungarica,https://doi.org/10.1556/004.2018.044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30264619/,264

Here, the rotation of isolated submicrometer superfluid ^{4}He droplets is studied by ultrafast x-ray diffraction using a free electron laser. The diffraction patterns provide simultaneous access to the morphology of the droplets and the vortex arrays they host. In capsule-shaped droplets, vortices form a distorted triangular lattice, whereas they arrange along elliptical contours in ellipsoidal droplets. The combined action of vortices and capillary waves results in droplet shapes close to those of classical droplets rotating with the same angular velocity. The findings are corroborated by density functional theory calculations describing the velocity fields and shape deformations of a rotating superfluid cylinder.","O'Connell, Sean M O; Tanyag, Rico Mayro P; Verma, Deepak; Bernando, Charles; Pang, Weiwu; Bacellar, Camila; Saladrigas, Catherine A; Mahl, Johannes; Toulson, Benjamin W; Kumagai, Yoshiaki; Walter, Peter; Ancilotto, Francesco; Barranco, Manuel; Pi, Marti; Bostedt, Christoph; Gessner, Oliver; Vilesov, Andrey F",Physical review letters,https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.124.215301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530661/,264
119697,Neurologic complications after allogeneic transplantation: a meta-analysis.,2019,"BACKGROUND The assessment of diaphragm function with diaphragm ultrasound seems to bring important clinical information to describe diaphragm work and weakness. When the diaphragm is weak, extradiaphragmatic muscles may play an important role, but whether ultrasound can also assess their activity and function is unknown. This study aimed to (1) evaluate the feasibility of measuring the thickening of the parasternal intercostal and investigate the responsiveness of this muscle to assisted ventilation; and (2) evaluate whether a combined evaluation of the parasternal and the diaphragm could predict failure of a spontaneous breathing trial. METHODS First, an exploratory evaluation of the parasternal in 23 healthy subjects. Second, the responsiveness of parasternal to several pressure support levels were studied in 16 patients. Last, parasternal activity was compared in presence or absence of diaphragm dysfunction (assessed by magnetic stimulation of the phrenic nerves and ultrasound) and in case of success/failure of a spontaneous breathing trial in 54 patients. RESULTS The parasternal was easily accessible in all patients. The interobserver reproducibility was good (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.77 (95% CI, 0.53 to 0.89). There was a progressive decrease in parasternal muscle thickening fraction with increasing levels of pressure support (Spearman ρ = -0.61 [95% CI, -0.74 to -0.44]; P < 0.0001) and an inverse correlation between parasternal muscle thickening fraction and the pressure generating capacity of the diaphragm (Spearman ρ = -0.79 [95% CI, -0.87 to -0.66]; P < 0.0001). The parasternal muscle thickening fraction was higher in patients with diaphragm dysfunction: 17% (10 to 25) versus 5% (3 to 8), P < 0.0001. The pressure generating capacity of the diaphragm, the diaphragm thickening fraction and the parasternal thickening fraction similarly predicted failure or the spontaneous breathing trial. CONCLUSIONS Ultrasound assessment of the parasternal intercostal muscle is feasible in the intensive care unit and provides novel information regarding the respiratory capacity load balance. : WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS TOPIC: Ultrasound can be used to assess work (i.e., function) and weakness of the diaphragm. This can be helpful in predicting difficulty in weaning patients from mechanical ventilation.Patients who have weakness of the diaphragm may compensate with parasternal muscle activity. However, the feasibility of measuring parasternal intercostal muscle thickening with ultrasound and the ability of these measures to be combined with ultrasound evaluation of the diaphragm in order to predict ability to wean from mechanical ventilation has not been well explored. WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT IS NEW Parasternal intercostal muscle thickness can be measured with ultrasound with good interobserver reproducibility.Parasternal intercostal muscle thickening was responsive to the level of ventilator assistance and significantly higher (i.e., increased) in mechanically ventilated patients with diaphragm dysfunction.The pressure-generating capacity of the diaphragm, the diaphragm-thickening fraction, and the parasternal intercostal muscle-thickening fraction were all significantly associated with failure of a spontaneous breathing trial in mechanically ventilated patients.","Dres, Martin; Dubé, Bruno-Pierre; Goligher, Ewan; Vorona, Stefannie; Demiri, Suela; Morawiec, Elise; Mayaux, Julien; Brochard, Laurent; Similowski, Thomas; Demoule, Alexandre",Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0000000000003191; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32084029/,264

Understanding progenitor heterogeneity is a major challenge. The Drosophila larval lymph gland is a well-studied model to understand blood progenitor maintenance and recapitulates several aspects of vertebrate hematopoiesis. However in-depth analysis has focused on the anterior lobe progenitors (AP), ignoring the posterior progenitors (PP) from the posterior lobes. Using in situ expression mapping, developmental and transcriptome analysis we reveal PP heterogeneity and identify molecular-genetic tools to study this abundant progenitor population. Functional analysis shows that PP resist differentiation upon immune challenge, in a JAK-STAT-dependent manner. Upon wasp parasitism, AP downregulate JAK-STAT signaling and form lamellocytes. In contrast, we show that PP activate STAT92E and remain undifferentiated, promoting survival. Stat92E knockdown or genetically reducing JAK-STAT signaling permits PP lamellocyte differentiation. We discuss how heterogeneity and compartmentalization allow functional segregation in response to systemic cues and could be widely applicable.","Rodrigues, Diana; Renaud, Yoan; VijayRaghavan, K; Waltzer, Lucas; Inamdar, Maneesha S",eLife,https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.61409; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594977/,264

With the purpose of gradually replacing the use of plastics in cosmetic products (primary microplastics), the use of paraffin in microspheres has recently been applied. Paraffin waxes are composed by organic molecules usually derived from petroleum, thus assumed to be chemically and biologically inert, having a lower (eco)toxicity and residence time compared with plastic particles. However, the low ecotoxicity of paraffin waxes may be somewhat questionable, because some paraffin constituents can be absorbed and catabolized, thus exerting biological effects. The main objective of this study was to understand the potential toxic effects of paraffin microparticles on key physiological processes of the polychaete Hediste diversicolor. To attain this objective, this work assessed the acute and chronic effects of three densities (5, 20, and 80 mg L-1) of four size ranges of paraffin particles (from 100 to 1200 μm) on this epibenthic organism. Although paraffin wax can be generically considered innocuous, the present study was able to demonstrate a significant inhibition in the activity of acetylcholinesterase in acutely exposed organisms and an increase in the activity of glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and glutathione S-transferase under some specific scenarios.","Gomes, Ana Sofia; Castro, Bruno B; Nunes, Bruno",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-10390-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803587/,264

In order to identify these areas, the authors prepared an index of vulnerability to severe cases of COVID-19 based on the construction, weighting, and integration of three levels of information: mean number of residents per household and density of persons 60 years or older (both per census tract) and neighborhood tuberculosis incidence rate in the year 2018. The data on residents per household and density of persons 60 years or older were obtained from the 2010 Population Census, and data on tuberculosis incidence were taken from the Brazilian Information System for Notificable Diseases (SINAN). Weighting of the indicators comprising the index used analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and the levels of information were integrated via weighted linear combination with map algebra. Spatialization of the index of vulnerability to severe COVID-19 in the city of Rio de Janeiro reveals the existence of more vulnerable areas in different parts of the city's territory, reflecting its urban complexity. The areas with greatest vulnerability are located in the North and West Zones of the city and in poor neighborhoods nested within upper-income parts of the South and West Zones. Understanding these conditions of vulnerability can facilitate the development of strategies to monitor the evolution of COVID-19 and orient measures for prevention and health promotion.","Santos, Jefferson Pereira Caldas Dos; Siqueira, Alexandre San Pedro; Praça, Heitor Levy Ferreira; Albuquerque, Hermano Gomes",Cadernos de saude publica,https://doi.org/10.1590/0102-311x00075720; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32428080/,264

Little is known about how the pandemic has affected mental health providers and their practice. In July 2020, we conducted a web-based survey of 500 licensed mental health providers to assess their employment and caseloads, logistics of care, quality of care, and patient-provider relationships and communication during the pandemic. Over 90% of providers reported changes to their employment (e.g., furloughs), with 64% no longer practicing. Providers who reported no longer practicing were older in age, racial minorities, served rural communities, worked in small clinics/provider networks, were social workers and marriage and family therapists, and relied on private insurance or out-of-pocket payment. Most practicing providers reported similar-to-increased caseloads (62%), new patients seeking services (67%), and appointment frequency (70%). Approximately 97% of providers used telemedicine, with 54% providing services mostly-to-exclusively via telemedicine. Most providers reported losing contact with patients deemed unstable (76%) or a danger to themselves/others (71%).

The presence of significant fibrosis is a key determinant of NAFLD progression, and liver steatosis has substantial cardiovascular implications. We aimed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of common noninvasive diagnostic tests for steatosis and fibrosis in the obese. METHODS We recruited 182 severely and morbidly obese individuals undergoing bariatric surgery (age 44 ± 12 years, body mass index 45.1 ± 8.3 kg/m2). Medical history, blood tests and liver biopsy were taken on the day of surgery. Serum steatosis and fibrosis scores were calculated. In a subgroup of patients, transient elastography with controlled attenuation parameter (TE/CAP) (n = 82) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) (n = 49) were performed. RESULTS 1H-MRS had excellent diagnostic accuracy for steatosis, with strong correlation to steatosis (r = 0.647, p < 0.001), good AUROC (0.852, p = 0.001), sensitivity (81.3%) and specificity (87.5%). However, due to low feasibility in this cohort (65.3% success), this was substantially decreased with intention-to-diagnose analysis (sensitivity 50.0%, specificity 60.9%). CAP had good feasibility (80.5%), and performed better in intention-to-diagnose analysis (AUROC 0.688, sensitivity 84.8%, specificity 47.2%). Serum steatosis scores performed poorly, with comparable accuracy to ALT. For significant fibrosis, TE had the best accuracy (AUROC 0.903, p = 0.007), which remained reasonable after intention-to-diagnose analysis (sensitivity 100%, specificity 59.0%). A combination approach using CAP with ALT for steatosis and TE with Forn index for fibrosis yielded reasonable overall accuracy. CONCLUSIONS 1H-MRS and TE/CAP had greatest accuracy for NAFLD-related steatosis and fibrosis. Failure rates in obesity significantly diminished diagnostic ability. Use of a combination of serum and imaging tests improved overall feasibility of assessment and diagnostic accuracy in obese individuals.","Ooi, Geraldine J; Earnest, Arul; Kemp, William W; Burton, Paul R; Laurie, Cheryl; Majeed, Ammar; Johnson, Nathan; McLean, Catriona; Roberts, Stuart K; Brown, Wendy A",International journal of obesity,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41366-018-0007-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29463916/,264

MATERIALS AND METHODS Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with trial sequential analysis (TSA). RCT inclusion criteria were patients with T2DM from one of these subgroups: elderly, obese, previous atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), previous coronary-heart disease (CHD), previous heart failure (HF) or previous chronic kidney disease (CKD). RCTs describing those subgroups with at least 48 weeks were included. Outcomes: 3-point MACE; cardiovascular (CV) death; hospitalization due to HF; and renal outcomes. We performed direct meta-analysis with the number of events in the intervention and control groups in each subset, and the relative risk of events was calculated. RESULTS SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) were the only anti-hyperglycemic agents related to reduction in CV events in different populations. For obese and elderly populations, GLP-1 RA were associated with benefits in 3-point MACE; for patients with ASCVD, both SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA had benefits in 3-point MACE, while for patients with CHD, only SGLT2i were beneficial. CONCLUSIONS SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA reduced CV events in selected populations: SGLT2i led to a reduction in events in patients with previous CHD, ASCVD and HF. GLP-1 RA led to a reduction in CV events in patients with ASCVD, elderly and patients with obesity. TSA shows that these findings are conclusive.

METHODS The PRISMA guidelines were followed. We searched bibliographic databases (Embase, MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL)) from inception to 1st August 2018. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised studies were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers independently scrutinized studies for relevance, extracted data and assessed quality of studies. Risk of bias of studies and quality of evidence were assessed using ROBINS-I tool and GRADEpro respectively. Primary outcomes were survival to 30 days with favourable neurological outcomes and survival to hospital discharge with favourable neurological outcomes. Secondary outcomes were survival to 30 days, survival to hospital discharge and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) post-hospital arrival for patients with ongoing resuscitation. This systematic review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD 42018093369) RESULTS: We included data from 17 observational studies on out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients in meta-analyses. Overall, the certainty of evidence was very low. Pooling data from only adjusted analyses, care at CAC was not associated with increased likelihood of survival to 30 days with favourable neurological outcome (OR 2.92, 95% CI 0.68-12.48) and survival to 30 days (OR 2.14, 95% CI 0.73-6.29) compared to care at other hospitals. Whereas patients cared for at CACs had improved survival to hospital discharge with favourable neurological outcomes (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.74-2.84) and survival to hospital discharge (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.46-2.34). CONCLUSIONS Very low certainty of evidence suggests that post-cardiac arrest care at CACs is associated with improved outcomes at hospital discharge.

EA-230 has shown promising immunomodulatory and tissue-protective effects in animals and an excellent safety profile in human phase I studies that we performed. The present phase IIa study follows-up on these results by investigating the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of EA-230 under systemic inflammatory conditions induced by experimental human endotoxaemia. METHODS In this randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled phase IIa study, systemic inflammation was induced by intravenous administration of Escherichia coli-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS). At t = 0 hours, 36 healthy male volunteers received 2 ng/kg LPS, followed by a 2-hour continuous infusion of EA-230 (15, 45 and 90 mg/kg/h, n = 8 per group) or placebo (n = 12). RESULTS EA-230 was well tolerated and showed a favourable safety profile. Treatment with the highest dose of EA-230 resulted in a significant attenuation of the LPS-induced increase in plasma levels of inflammatory mediators interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-1 receptor antagonist, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory proteins-1α and -1β, and vascular cell adhesion protein-1 (% reduction of 48, 28, 33, 28, 14, 16 and 19 respectively, p < .01), and reduced fever (peak decrease from 1.8 ± 0.1°C to 1.3 ± 0.2°C, P < .05) and symptom scores (peak decrease from 7.4 ± 1.0 to 4.0 ± 1.2 points, P < .05). EA-230 exhibited a very short elimination half-life and a large volume of distribution in the highest dosage group (geometric mean and 95% confidence interval: 0.17 [0.12-0.24] hours and 2.2 [1.3-3.8] L/kg, respectively).

TREATMENT Current management of benign and premalignant lesions of the foregut includes primarily ablative and resective endoscopic techniques as well as thoracoscopic, laparoscopic, and open surgical techniques of enucleation and segmental resections. The appropriate procedure, however, is based on the depth of penetration, lesion location, and suspicion for underlying malignant potential.","Marks, Jeffrey Michael; King, Andrea Jo",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-014-2677-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25394385/,264

METHOD Sixteen participants underwent the aforementioned conditions on four separate days. During each test participants rested supine (Environmental conditions: 30 °C, 50% rh) for 30-min before 40 mL of L, M, H or P gel was applied to the anterior upper body, then rested 30-min thereafter. Primary measures included thermal sensation (TS), thermal comfort (TC), irritation (IRR), rectal temperature (Tre), and skin temperature (chest, forearm, thigh, calf), and EMG (trapezius, pectoralis major, sternocleidomastoid). The area under the curve (AUC) from minute 30 to 60 was compared between conditions using relevant non/parametric tests (alpha level = 0.05). RESULTS A cooling trend in Tre was observed following Placebo gel application, but this significantly (p < 0.05) reversed into a heat storage response in M and H. Both TS and TC significantly differed by condition (p < 0.001) in a dose-dependent manner, with L, M, and H doses eliciting significantly cooler sensations and more discomfort than P (p < 0.05). Irritation significantly differed by condition (p < 0.01) in a dose-dependent manner, with L and M eliciting significantly greater irritation than P (p < 0.01). No other differences were observed. CONCLUSIONS Menthol exerts perceptual and thermoregulatory effects independent of skin temperature. A menthol dose-dependent perceptual cooling effect was evident with possible saturation at the moderate dose. A dose-dependent alteration in deep body temperature was also evident.","Gillis, D Jason; Capone, Selena; Nestor, Kacey; Snell, Mitchel",Journal of thermal biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102659; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888563/,264

Background: Protective measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic are associated with isolation among people in need of elderly care. Due to the known adverse effects of social isolation on health, discussions have been held about the ethical legitimacy and commensurability of these measures. AIM The article aims to show in which format the discourse in scientific publication on protective measures against COVID-19 took place and which contents have been addressed. METHODS A mapping review in PubMed has been conducted. All publication types of scientific papers on nursing care of older people were considered. The results were synthesized in form of a quantitative content analysis of key aspects. RESULTS The 38 articles included in the synthesis show that only a small part of the scientific publications on the COVID-19 pandemic deals with people living in nursing homes. Although critical aspects related to the isolation caused by the protective measures against the COVID-19 pandemic are named in half of the contributions, specific measures to address the negative effects of the isolation are rarely mentioned. CONCLUSIONS There is a need for further activities in research and nursing practice in order to meet the demand and desiderata of those in need of care and to enable personal responsibility and self-determination even in a special situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Fischer, Florian; Raiber, Lea; Boscher, Claudia; Winter, Maik H-J",Pflege,https://doi.org/10.1024/1012-5302/a000745; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32811330/,264

However, reports on needlescopic transabdominal preperitoneal repair using one umbilical 5-mm and two lateral 3-mm trocars are extremely rare. METHODS Seven patients with unilateral inguinal hernia underwent this surgical procedure. A 5-mm trocar was inserted from the umbilical and two 3-mm trocars were inserted from the lateral. After dissection of the preperitoneal layer, a mesh was fixed using a tucker inserted from the umbilical 5-mm trocar while viewing through the 3-mm optics from the lateral trocar. RESULTS All procedures were completed without intraoperative complications and conversion to the conventional method. The surgical results of our needlescopic TAPP repair have been shown to not be inferior to those of the conventional method.

123083,The atrial fibrillation epidemic is approaching the physician's door: will mobile technology improve detection?,2014,"We describe a real time, noninvasive method of estimating work of breathing (esophageal balloon not required) during noninvasive pressure support (PS) that uses an artificial neural network (ANN) combined with a leak correction (LC) algorithm, programmed to ignore asynchronous breaths, that corrects for differences in inhaled and exhaled tidal volume (VT) from facemask leaks (WOBANN,LC/min). Validation studies of WOBANN,LC/min were performed. Using a dedicated and popular noninvasive ventilation ventilator (V60, Philips), in vitro studies using PS (5 and 10 cm H2O) at various inspiratory flow rate demands were simulated with a lung model. WOBANN,LC/min was compared with the actual work of breathing, determined under conditions of no facemask leaks and estimated using an ANN (WOBANN/min). Using the same ventilator, an in vivo study of healthy adults (n = 8) receiving combinations of PS (3-10 cm H2O) and expiratory positive airway pressure was done. WOBANN,LC/min was compared with physiologic work of breathing/min (WOBPHYS/min), determined from changes in esophageal pressure and VT applied to a Campbell diagram. For the in vitro studies, WOBANN,LC/min and WOBANN/min ranged from 2.4 to 11.9 J/min and there was an excellent relationship between WOBANN,LC/breath and WOBANN/breath, r = 0.99, r(2) = 0.98 (p < 0.01). There were essentially no differences between WOBANN,LC/min and WOBANN/min. For the in vivo study, WOBANN,LC/min and WOBPHYS/min ranged from 3 to 12 J/min and there was an excellent relationship between WOBANN,LC/breath and WOBPHYS/breath, r = 0.93, r(2) = 0.86 (p < 0.01). An ANN combined with a facemask LC algorithm provides noninvasive and valid estimates of work of breathing during noninvasive PS. WOBANN,LC/min, automatically and continuously estimated, may be useful for assessing inspiratory muscle loads and guiding noninvasive PS settings as in a decision support system to appropriately unload inspiratory muscles.","Banner, Michael J; Tams, Carl G; Euliano, Neil R; Stephan, Paul J; Leavitt, Trevor J; Martin, A Daniel; Al-Rawas, Nawar; Gabrielli, Andrea",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-015-9716-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26070542/,264

The aim of this study was to perform a quality assessment of large loop excision of the transformation zone in women of reproductive age by evaluating the surgeons' colposcopic experience. Materials and Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed on diagnostic or therapeutic large loop excision of the transformation zone. The following variables were analyzed: age, parity, indications for surgery, level of surgeon's colposcopic experience, definitive histological diagnosis, margin involvement, and the presence and type of artifacts interfering with the pathological interpretation. Patients were divided into three groups: group A - 75 patients treated by junior colposcopists; group B - 74 patients treated by experienced colposcopists, and group C - 117 patients treated by expert colposcopists. Results: Regarding the presence and diagnostic significance of the artifacts the groups were significantly different. Inadequate samples were the least frequent in group C. Artifacts precluding histological diagnosis were the most common in group A. The margins were predominantly inconclusive in group A. Conclusions: A high rate of artifacts is a disadvantage of the large loop excision of the transformation zone performed by surgeons less skilled for colposcopy. Although large loop excision of the transformation zone is considered to be a minor surgery, skills in colposcopy are an essential prerequisite for optimal results.","Sparić, R; Tinelli, A; Guido, M; Stefanović, R; Babović, I; Kesić, V",Geburtshilfe und Frauenheilkunde,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0042-113773; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28017975/,264
123414,Hypersensitivity to COVID-19 Vaccine Confirmed by a Positive Skin Test Result: A Case Report.,2021-06-14,"BACKGROUND Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are common following laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Dexamethasone has been reported to reduce PONV. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the effect of dexmedetomidine in decreasing PONV. This study was designed to compare the effects of a single dose of dexmedetomidine to dexamethasone for reducing PONV after LC. METHODS Eighty-six adult patients scheduled for LC were randomized to receive either single dose 1 µg/kg of dexmedetomidine (Dexmed group, N = 43) or 8 mg dexamethasone (Dexa group, N = 43) before skin incision. During the first 24 h postoperatively, the incidence and severity of PONV were assessed. Pain and sedation scores were assessed on arrival in the recovery room and early postoperatively. Analgesic and antiemetic consumption during the 24 h after surgery were calculated. Intra-operative and postoperative hemodynamics were recorded. RESULTS Twenty-one percent of the patients in the Dexmed group developed PONV compared to 28% in the Dexa group (P = 0.6). Severity of PONV was similar between the two groups (P = 0.07). Early postoperatively, pain severity was significantly lower in the Dexmed group, but sedation scores were significantly higher. The first analgesic request was significantly delayed in the Dexmed group (P = 0.02). The total amounts of intraoperative fentanyl and postoperative tramadol administered were significantly lower in the Dexmed group. No difference in ondansetron was noted between the two groups. Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were significantly lower in the Dexmed group after administration of dexmedetomidine. No major side effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS Dexmedetomidine reduces the incidence and severity of PONV, similar to dexamethasone. It is superior to dexamethasone in reducing postoperative pain and total analgesic consumption during the first 24 h after LC.","Bakri, Mohamed H; Ismail, Eman A; Ibrahim, Ahmed",Korean journal of anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.4097/kjae.2015.68.3.254; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26045928/,264

123594,Catheter-directed thrombolysis of deep venous thrombosis.,2013,"INTRODUCTION Completed randomized trials on endovascular thrombectomy (ET) did not independently assess the efficacy of ET in the elderly (≥80 years old) who were often excluded or under-represented in trials. There were also inconsistent criteria for patient selection in this population across the different trials. This work evaluates outcomes after ET for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in the elderly at a high volume stroke center. METHODS We reviewed all cases of AIS that underwent a direct aspiration first pass technique (ADAPT) thrombectomy for large vessel occlusions between March 2013 and October 2017 while comparing outcomes in the elderly with younger counterparts. We also reviewed AIS cases in elderly patients undergoing medical management who were matched to the ET counterparts by demographics, comorbidities, baseline deficits, and stroke severity. RESULTS Of 560 patients undergoing ET for AIS, 108 patients were in the elderly group (≥80 years of age), and had a significantly lower likelihood of functional independence (defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2) at 90 days compared with younger patients (20.5% vs 44.4%, P<0.001), and higher mortality rates (34.3% vs 20%, P<0.001). When compared with patients undergoing medical management, elderly patients did not have a significant improvement in rates of good outcomes (20.5% vs 19.5%, P>0.05), and had significantly higher rates of hemorrhage (40.7% vs 9.3%, P<0.001). We also identified baseline stroke severity and the incidence of hemorrhage as two independent predictors of outcome in the elderly patients. CONCLUSIONS ET in the elderly did not show a similar benefit to younger patients when compared with medical management. These findings emphasize the need for more optimal selection criteria for the elderly population to improve the risk to benefit ratio of ET.","Alawieh, Ali; Chatterjee, Arindam; Feng, Wuwei; Porto, Guilherme; Vargas, Jan; Kellogg, Ryan; Turk, Aquilla S; Turner, Raymond D; Imran Chaudry, M; Spiotta, Alejandro M",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2018-013787; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29666180/,264
123758,Very Late-onset Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders.,2021-05-07,"Inflammation is an essential cytokine-mediated process for generating a neutralizing immune response against pathogens and is generally protective. However, aberrant or excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines is associated with uncontrolled local and systemic inflammation, resulting in cell death and often irreversible tissue damage. Uncontrolled inflammation can manifest over timescales spanning hours to years and is primarily dependent on the triggering event. Rapid and potentially lethal increase in cytokine production, or a 'cytokine storm,' develops in hours to days and is associated with cancer cell-based immunotherapies, such as CAR-T cell therapy. On the other hand, some bacterial and viral infections with high microbial replication or highly potent antigens elicit immune responses that result in supraphysiological systemic cytokine concentrations which manifest over days to weeks. Immune dysregulation in autoimmune diseases can lead to chronic cytokine-mediated tissue damage spanning months to years, which often occurs episodically. While the initiating events and cellular participants may differ in these disease processes, many of the cytokines that drive disease progression are shared. For example, upregulation of IL-1, IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF, and GM-CSF frequently coincides with cytokine storm, sepsis, and autoimmune disease. Targeted inhibition of these pro-inflammatory molecules via antagonist monoclonal antibodies has improved clinical outcomes, but the complexity of the underlying immune dysregulation results in high variability. Rather than a ""one size fits all"" treatment approach, an identification of disease endotypes may permit the development of effective therapeutic strategies that address the contributors of disease progression. Here, we present a literature review of the cytokine-associated etiology of acute and chronic cytokine-mediated tissue damage, describe successes and challenges in developing clinical treatments, and highlight advancements in preclinical therapeutic strategies for mitigating pathological cytokine production.","McBride, David A; Kerr, Matthew D; Dorn, Nicholas C; Ogbonna, Dora A; Santos, Evan C; Shah, Nisarg J",European medical journal.

Several studies have revealed that viral proteins encoded by DTMUV antagonize host IFN-mediated antiviral responses to facilitate virus replication. However, the role of host gene expression regulated by DTMUV in innate immune evasion remains largely unknown. Here, we utilized a stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based proteomics analysis of DTMUV-infected duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs) to comprehensively investigate host proteins involved in DTMUV replication and innate immune response. A total of 250 differentially expressed proteins were identified from 2697 quantified cellular proteins, among which duck interferon-induced protein 35 (duIFI35) was dramatically up-regulated due to DTMUV infection in DEFs. Next, we demonstrated that duIFI35 expression promoted DTMUV replication and impaired Sendai virus-induced IFN-β production. Moreover, duIFI35 was able to impede duck RIG-I (duRIG-I)-induced IFN-β promoter activity, rather than IFN-β transcription mediated by MDA5, MAVS, TBK1, IKKϵ, and IRF7. Importantly, we found that because of the specific interaction with duIFI35, the capacity of duRIG-I to recognize double-stranded RNA was significantly impaired, resulting in the decline of duRIG-I-induced IFN-β production. Taken together, our data revealed that duIFI35 expression stimulated by DTMUV infection disrupted duRIG-I-mediated host antiviral response, elucidating a distinct function of duIFI35 from human IFI35, by which DTMUV escapes host innate immune response, and providing information for the design of antiviral drug.","Zhou, Peng; Ma, Lei; Rao, Zaixiao; Li, Yaqian; Zheng, Huijun; He, Qigai; Luo, Rui",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.711517; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34335626/,264

Objective To investigate the association between perinatal maternal depression and an increased long-term risk of depression in their adolescent and adult offspring. Data Sources A systematic search of the electronic databases of PubMed and PsycINFO was conducted from May 2019 to June 2019. Study Selection A total of 6309 articles were identified, of which 88 articles were extracted for full-text review by 2 reviewers. Only articles reporting data from prospective longitudinal studies that assessed maternal depression during antenatal and/or postnatal periods and resulting offspring 12 years or older with measures of established psychometric properties were included. Exclusion criteria consisted of all other study designs, mothers with other medical and psychiatric comorbidities, and offspring younger than 12 years. Data Extraction and Synthesis Data were extracted by 2 independent reviewers, and discrepancies were mediated by an expert third reviewer. Meta-analysis was performed using Bayesian statistical inference and reported using Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guideline. The association of depression timing with the sex of offspring was explored using metaregression. Main Outcomes and Measures Offspring depression was evaluated using standardized depression scales or clinical interviews. Results Six studies with a total of 15 584 mother-child dyads were included in the meta-analysis, which found the offspring of mothers who experienced perinatal depression to have increased odds of depression (odds ratio [OR], 1.70; 95% credible interval [CrI], 1.60-2.65; posterior probability [PP] [OR >1], 98.6%). Although metaregression found no evidence for an overall association between perinatal depression timing and offspring depression (antenatal vs postnatal, PP [OR >1] = 53.8%), subgroup analyses showed slightly higher pooled odds for the antenatal studies (OR, 1.78; 95% CrI, 0.93-3.33; PP [OR >1] = 96.2%) than for the postnatal studies (OR, 1.66; 95% CrI, 0.65-3.84; PP [OR >1] = 88.0%). Female adolescent offspring recorded higher rates of depression in metaregression analyses, such that a 1% increase in the percentage of female (relative to male) offspring was associated with a 6% increase in the odds of offspring depression (OR, 1.06; 95% CrI, 0.99-1.14; τ2 = 0.31). Conclusions and Relevance In this study, maternal perinatal depression, especially antenatal depression, was associated with the risk of depression in adolescence and adulthood. More research into the mechanisms of depression risk transmission and assessments of postinterventional risk reduction could aid in the development of future strategies to tackle depressive disorders in pregnancy.","Tirumalaraju, Vaishali; Suchting, Robert; Evans, Jonathan; Goetzl, Laura; Refuerzo, Jerrie; Neumann, Alexander; Anand, Deepa; Ravikumar, Rekha; Green, Charles E; Cowen, Philip J; Selvaraj, Sudhakar",JAMA network open,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.8783; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32602910/,264

DESIGN A retrospective descriptive study (Canadian Task Force classification III). SETTING Multiple academic teaching hospitals. PATIENTS Women with Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d'Obstétrique FIGO stage IA1 to IB1 cervical cancer. INTERVENTIONS LESS-RH as the primary therapy for cervical cancer performed by a gynecologic oncologist with expertise in LESS. A multichannel, single-port access device; a flexible-tipped 5-mm laparoscope; and a multifunctional instrument were used in all cases. Clinicopathologic, surgical, and perioperative outcomes were analyzed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Twenty-two women were identified in whom a LESS-RH was attempted; 20 (91%) successfully underwent the procedure, including 19 in whom pelvic lymphadenectomy (PLND) was completed. Of the 2 converted procedures, 1 patient underwent 2-port laparoscopy secondary to truncal obesity, and 1 patient underwent conversion to laparotomy secondary to external iliac vein laceration during PLND. The median age and body mass index were 46 years and 23.3 kg/m(2), respectively. The median number of pelvic lymph nodes removed was 22. One patient experienced an intraoperative complication, and no patient required reoperation. The margins of excision were negative. One patient with 2 positive pelvic nodes and 1 patient with microscopic parametrial disease received adjuvant chemosensitized radiation; 3 additional patients received adjuvant radiation therapy secondary to an intermediate risk for recurrence. After a median follow up of 11 months, no recurrences were detected. CONCLUSION LESS-RH/PLND is feasible and safe for select patients with stage I cervical cancer. Larger studies are needed to confirm whether the increased technical difficulty of this procedure justifies its use in routine gynecologic oncology practice.","Boruta, David M; Fagotti, Anna; Bradford, Leslie S; Escobar, Pedro F; Scambia, Giovanni; Kushnir, Christina L; Michener, Chad M; Fader, Amanda Nickles",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmig.2013.10.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24161887/,264

We developed ""REDIAL-2020"", a suite of machine learning models for estimating small molecule activity from molecular structure, for a range of SARS-CoV-2 related assays. Each classifier is based on three distinct types of descriptors (fingerprint, physicochemical, and pharmacophore) for parallel model development. These models were trained using high throughput screening data from the NCATS COVID19 portal (https://opendata.ncats.nih.gov/covid19/index.html), with multiple categorical machine learning algorithms. The ""best models"" are combined in an ensemble consensus predictor that outperforms single models where external validation is available. This suite of machine learning models is available through the DrugCentral web portal (http://drugcentral.org/Redial). Acceptable input formats are: drug name, PubChem CID, or SMILES; the output is an estimate of anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities. The web application reports estimated activity across three areas (viral entry, viral replication, and live virus infectivity) spanning six independent models, followed by a similarity search that displays the most similar molecules to the query among experimentally determined data. The ML models have 60% to 74% external predictivity, based on three separate datasets. Complementing the NCATS COVID19 portal, REDIAL-2020 can serve as a rapid online tool for identifying active molecules for COVID-19 treatment.

125640,Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Seasonal Influenza Vaccination among Dialysis Facilities in the United States.,2020-08-13,"Background and Purpose: Blood Blister-like aneurysms (BBAs) of the internal carotid artery (ICA) are rare entities of cerebral aneurysms. FD use in acutely ruptured aneurysms, timing of treatment and antiplatelet regimen are main debate topics in clinical practice when the treatment decision is flow diversion. The aim of this study is to report the safety and efficacy of a single-center FD treatment for ruptured BBAs in the early phase of SAH using the SAPT regimen. Material and Method: This study involved a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database. Records of patients admitted to our clinic and treated by endovascular route on ruptured BBA between January 2013 and December 2020 were reviewed. Ruptured supraclinoid ICA BBAs treated with FD devices with SAPT within 48 h from ictus of SAH are included. BBA of atypical anatomic locations, other endovascular techniques performed, and delayed admissions (>48 h) were excluded from the study. Demographic, clinical and angiographic features of patients and aneurysms, FD types and numbers, periprocedural complications, immediate and follow-up angiographic and clinical outcomes were recorded. Results: A total of six patients with ruptured BBAs treated via FDs within 48 h and used SAPT were included in the study. The mean age was 41.6 years (range from 34 to 45 years), and four of six patients were female. All patients were treated within 48 h after ictus, and the mean treatment day was 1.33 days. One patient received ticagrelor, and five patients received prasugrel as SAPT for one year after treatment. No procedure-related death and rebleeding were recorded. One (16.7 %) treatment responsive procedure-related complication occurred (transient ischemia). Overall good outcome rate was 83.3%. One patient died due to pneumonia. The immediate control angiograms showed complete occlusions of BBAs in one patient (16.6%). The complete occlusion rate was 100 % for five survivors at the control angiogram. The median follow-up was 49.5 months. Conclusion: This single-center experience suggests that early treatment (<2 days) within SAH of ruptured BBAs with FDs using SAPT is safe and effective in terms of clinical and radiological long-term outcomes.","Tanburoglu, Anil; Andic, Cagatay",Frontiers in neurology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.708411; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34630284/,264

OBJECTIVES Develop and refine a basic dataset to enable standardized documentation of physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT) interventions delivered in a controlled clinical trial intended to improve voluntary motor function. SETTING International Expert Working Group. METHODS An international working group with expertise in spinal cord injury, PT, OT, and measurement developed a draft of the International Spinal Cord Injury (ISCI) Physical Therapy-Occupational Therapy (PT-OT) Basic Data Set (BDS). Emphasis was placed on efficiency and practicality of use. The BDS was iteratively refined based on applicable literature, and feedback collected from presentations at the 2017 and 2019 International Spinal Cord Society meetings. RESULTS The ISCI PT-OT BDS contains seven broad categories of interventions: bed/seated mobility, standing activities, walking/stairs, gross motor upper extremity, fine motor upper extremity, strength training, and endurance training. The first five categories are classified as activity-directed and the last two as impairment-directed interventions. Time spent on interventions per category is recorded in 15-min intervals. CONCLUSIONS The ISCI PT-OT BDS enables standardized documentation of PT-OT activity-directed or impairment-directed interventions. The ISCI PT-OT BDS is a documentation tool to facilitate evaluation of the influence of rehabilitation therapies on motor function in clinical trials of biologic or pharmacologic agents or rehabilitation technologies that are delivered in the clinical setting.","Anderson, Kim D; Field-Fote, Edelle C; Biering-Sørensen, Fin; Bryden, Anne; Harvey, Lisa A; Jones, Linda; Mulcahey, M J; Mulroy, Sara; Noonan, Vanessa K; Post, Marcel W M; Rupp, Rüdiger; Schmidt-Read, Mary",Spinal cord series and cases,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41394-020-00323-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32807768/,264

We performed a nationwide online survey on epilepsy characteristics/treatment, quality of life/daily living followed by Standardized Assessment of Personality-Abbreviated Scale, Major Depression Inventory, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (brief) and the brief Epilepsy Anxiety Survey Instrument. The survey was sent to 275 representative patients with IGE ('Funen cohort') and later publicly distributed via the Danish Epilepsy Association. The characteristics of the responders of the 'Funen cohort' (n = 119) did not differ from non-responders and previously assessed data. Out of 753 persons accessing the public survey, 167 had probable IGE. As compared to the 'Funen cohort', patients from the public survey reported similar age, time since last seizure, years with disease, seizure types, and IGE syndromes but more current and previously tried anti-seizure medications (ASMs). In both cohorts, patients had higher scores for depression, impulsivity, and personality disorders as compared to Danish normal values irrespective of seizure control or medication. Higher depression and anxiety scores but neither impulsivity nor personality disorders were associated with ongoing seizures. Overall health condition was estimated as bad by 28%. In the last four weeks, 20.4% reported limitations of activities of daily living due to epilepsy; 27.8% felt fed up because of their epilepsy. Patients with high subjective disease burden had more current ASMs, shorter time since last seizure and increased scores for depression, anxiety, impulsivity, and personality disorders. In conclusion, having IGE was associated with higher scores for impulsivity, depression, and personality disorders irrespective of seizure control and current treatment. High subjective disease burden was common and associated with ongoing seizures, absence/myoclonic seizures and high scores for impulsivity, depression, anxiety, and personality disorders.","Mangaard, Sofie; Gesche, Joanna; Delcomyn, Line; Beier, Christoph P",Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.108232; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34416520/,264

Curcumin, a bioactive polyphenol from turmeric, is a well-known anti-inflammatory agent in preclinical research. Clinical evidence remains inconclusive because of discrepancies regarding optimal dosage, duration, and formulation of curcumin. OBJECTIVE The aim of this systematic review, conducted and reported in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and checklist, was to evaluate the efficacy of curcumin supplementation on systemic inflammatory mediators, comparing dose, duration, and bioavailability status of interventions. DATA SOURCES The Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, Scopus, and Cochrane literature databases were searched from 1980 to May-end 2019. Randomized controlled trials investigating effects of dietary curcumin on inflammatory mediators in humans not receiving anti-inflammatory treatment were eligible for inclusion. Two authors independently assessed titles and abstracts of identified articles for potential eligibility and respective, retrieved, full-text articles; disagreements were resolved by a third author. Evidence quality was critically appraised using the Quality Criteria Checklist for Primary Research. DATA EXTRACTION Thirty-two trials (N = 2,038 participants) were included and 28 were meta-analyzed using a random-effects model; effect sizes were expressed as Hedges' g (95%CI). DATA ANALYSIS Pooled data (reported here as weighted mean difference [WMD]; 95%CI) showed a reduction in C-reactive protein (-1.55 mg/L; -1.81 to -1.30), interleukin-6 (-1.69 pg/mL, -2.56 to -0.82), tumor necrosis factor α (-3.13 pg/mL; -4.62 to -1.64), IL-8 (-0.54 pg/mL; -0.82 to -0.28), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (-2.48 pg/mL; -3.96 to -1.00), and an increase in IL-10 (0.49 pg/mL; 0.10 to 0.88), with no effect on intracellular adhesion molecule-1. CONCLUSION These findings provide evidence for the anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin and support further investigation to confirm dose, duration, and formulation to optimize anti-inflammatory effects in humans with chronic inflammation.

DESIGN Prospective, nonrandomized clinical trial. ANIMALS 16 client-owned dogs with confirmed NLA obstruction. PROCEDURES Dogs underwent CT contrast dacryocystorhinography, rhinoscopy, and lacrimoscopy. Whenever possible, the NLA was stented, typically with fluoroscopic guidance. RESULTS Median duration of clinical signs prior to treatment was 3.2 months (range, 0.2 to 14 months). Causes of NLA obstruction were a foreign body (n = 5), dacryocystitis (4), stenosis secondary to fibrosis (3), granulation tissue (1), or granulation tissue in association with a small foreign body (1); a cause was not identified in 2 dogs. Stents were placed in 14 of 16 (88%) dogs for a median duration of 5.6 weeks (range, 1.3 to 9.4 weeks). Stenting was not possible in 2 dogs with stenosis of the NLA secondary to granulation tissue or fibrosis. Owners of all 16 dogs reported at least 60% clinical improvement with median improvement rated as 95%, and owners of 8 dogs reporting complete resolution of signs. Two dogs required antimicrobial administration because of dacryocystitis that persisted after stent removal; a foreign body was not found in either dog. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Overall clinical response and owner-rated improvement for dogs with NLA obstruction that underwent lacrimoscopy and fluoroscopically guided stenting were high, especially given that these dogs had failed to respond to conventional treatment.","Strom, Ann R; Culp, William T N; Leonard, Brian C; Dear, Jonathan D; Wisner, Erik R; Johnson, Lynelle R; Maggs, David J",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.252.12.1527; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29889638/,264

This study aims to shed light on the virus dynamics among wild carnivores thanks to the analysis of 213 samples collected between 1994 and 2013 in wild ecosystems from Spain. We determined the presence of carnivore parvovirus DNA by real-time PCR and sequenced the vp2 gen from 22 positive samples to characterize the strains and to perform phylogenetic analysis. The presence of carnivore parvovirus DNA was confirmed in 18% of the samples, with a higher prevalence detected in wolves (Canis lupus signatus, 70%). Fourteen sequences belonging to nine wolves, three Eurasian badgers (Meles meles), a common genet (Genetta genetta) and a European wildcat (Felis silvestris) were classified as canine parvovirus 2c (CPV-2c); five sequences from three wolves, a red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and a stone marten (Martes foina) as CPV-2b; and three sequences from a badger, a genet and a stone marten as feline parvovirus (FPV). This was the first report of a wildcat infected with a canine strain. Sequences described in this study were identical or very close related to others previously found in domestic carnivores from distant countries, suggesting that cross-species transmission takes place and that the parvovirus epidemiology in Spain, as elsewhere, could be influenced by global factors.","Calatayud, Olga; Esperón, Fernando; Velarde, Roser; Oleaga, Álvaro; Llaneza, Luis; Ribas, Alexis; Negre, Nieves; de la Torre, Ana; Rodríguez, Alejandro; Millán, Javier",Transboundary and emerging diseases,https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13378; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581349/,264

128564,"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Stroke Severity and Mortality in the South-East of Santiago, Chile.",2021-06-18,"Background Molecular imaging is of great benefit to early disease diagnosis and timely treatment. One of the most striking innovations is the development of multimodal molecular imaging technology, which integrates two or more imaging modalities, largely in view of making the best of the advantages of each modality while overcoming their respective shortcomings. Hence, engineering a versatile and easily prepared nanomaterial with integrating multimodal molecular imaging function holds great promise, but is still a great challenge. Materials and Methods We firstly designed and synthesized a BDT-DPP conjugated polymer and then noncovalent self-assembly with phospholipid-polyethylene glycol endowed BDT-DPP with water solubility and biocompatibility. Followed by [Cu] labeling, the acquired multifunctional nanoparticles (NPs) were studied in detail for the photophysical property. The cytotoxicity and biocompatibility of DPP-BDT NPs were examined through MTT assay and H&E stained analysis. In addition, we investigated the accumulation of the NPs in HepG2 tumor models by positron emission tomography (PET) and photoacoustic (PA) dual-mode imaging. Results and Discussion The DPP-BDT NPs exhibited excellent optical stability, strong near-infrared (NIR) light absorption as well as fine biocompatibility. After tail vein injection into the living mice, the PA signals in the neoplastic tissues were gradually increased and reached to the maximum at the 4-h post-injection, which was consistent with the PET analysis. Such strong PA and PET signals were attributed to the efficient NPs accumulation resulting from the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Conclusion The biocompatible DPP-BDT NPs demonstrated to be strong NIR absorption property and PAI sensitivity. Besides, these novel DPP-BDT NPs can act not only as a PA imaging contrast agent but also as an imaging agent for PET.","Li, Tingting; Hu, Xiaoming; Fan, Quli; Chen, Zejing; Zheng, Ziliang; Zhang, Ruiping",International journal of nanomedicine,https://doi.org/10.2147/ijn.s238679; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764933/,264
128882,Strategies to tackle unrecognized bilateral renal artery occlusion after endovascular aneurysm repair.,2012,"The pathogenesis of Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) infection, including development of lymphomas and carcinomas, is dependent on the ability of the virus to transit from latency to the lytic phase. This conversion, and ultimately disease development, depends on the molecular switch protein, ZEBRA, a viral bZIP transcription factor that initiates transcription from promoters of viral lytic genes. By binding to the origin of viral replication ZEBRA is also an essential replication protein. Here, we identified a novel DNA-binding motif of ZEBRA, N-terminal to the canonical bZIP domain. This RRTRK motif is important for high-affinity binding to DNA and is essential for recognizing the methylation state of viral promoters. Mutations in this motif lead to deficiencies in DNA-binding, recognition of DNA methylation, lytic cycle DNA replication and viral late gene expression. This work advances our understanding of ZEBRA-dependent activation of viral lytic cascade.IMPORTANCE The binding of ZEBRA to methylated and unmethylated viral DNA triggers activation of the EBV lytic cycle, leading to viral replication and, in some patients, cancer development. Our work thoroughly examines how ZEBRA uses a previously unrecognized basic motif to bind non-methylated and methylated DNA targets, leading to viral lytic activation. Our findings show that two different positively charged motifs, including the canonical BZIP domain and a newly identified RRTRK motif, contribute to the mechanism of DNA recognition by a viral AP-1 protein. This work contributes to the assessment of ZEBRA as a potential therapeutic target for antiviral and oncolytic treatments.","Weber, Erin; Buzovetsky, Olga; Heston, Lee; Yu, Kuan-Ping; Knecht, Kirsten M; El-Guindy, Ayman; Miller, George; Xiong, Yong",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00724-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31068430/,264

Coronavirus and picornavirus were identified and are known as pathogens causing quail enteritis that match the observed morphology. Abundant reads of coronavirus from quail samples yielded four fragment sequences exhibiting six genomes of avian coronavirus.

Concerted environmental challenges might induce trade-off when resource allocation to one trait occurs at the expense of another, also producing potential transgenerational effects in the offspring. We evaluated whether concerted challenges, in the form of an immune inoculum against inactivated Salmonella Enteritidis (immune challenge, ICH) and a chronic heat stress (CHS) exposure on adult Japanese quail, modulates the INE responses of the parental generation and their offspring. Adults were inoculated and later exposed to a CHS along 9 consecutive days. The last 5 days of CHS, eggs were collected for incubation. Chicks were identified according to their parental treatments and remained undisturbed. Induced inflammatory response, Heterophil/Lymphocyte (H/L) ratio and specific humoral response against sheep red blood cells (SRBC) were evaluated in both generations. Regardless of the ICH, stressed adults showed a reduced inflammatory response (p<0.001) and an elevated H/L ratio (p=0.02) compared to controls. In offspring, the inflammatory response was elevated (p=0.03) and the specific SRBC antibody titers were diminished (p=0.02) in those chicks prenatally exposed to CHS, regardless of the ICH. No differences were found in the H/L ratio of the offspring. Together, our results suggest that CHS exposure influences the INE interplay of adult quail, establishing trade-offs within their immune system. Moreover, CHS not only affected parental INE responses but also modulated their offspring, probably affecting their potential to respond to future challenges. The adaptability of offspring's programming would depend on the environment encountered.","Giayetto, Octavio; Videla, Emiliano A; Chacana, Pablo; Jaime, Cristian; Marín, Raúl H; Nazar, F Nicolás",The Journal of experimental biology,https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.219386; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680897/,264

However, the mechanism is currently unknown. The only available structural information on coronavirus nsp1 is the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure of the N-terminal domain of nsp1 from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) from the betacoronavirus genus. Here we present the first nsp1 structure from an alphacoronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) nsp1. It displays a six-stranded β-barrel fold with a long alpha helix on the rim of the barrel, a fold shared with SARS-CoV nsp1(13-128). Contrary to previous speculation, the TGEV nsp1 structure suggests that coronavirus nsp1s have a common origin, despite the lack of sequence homology. However, comparisons of surface electrostatics, shape, and amino acid conservation between the alpha- and betacoronaviruses lead us to speculate that the mechanism for nsp1-induced suppression of host gene expression might be different in these two genera.","Jansson, Anna M",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.03163-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23269811/,264

129795,Added Value of Rescue Devices in Intra-Arterial Thrombectomy: When Should We Apply Them?,2021,"Diamide insecticides, such as chlorantraniliprole, cyantraniliprole, and tetrachlorantraniliprole, are a new class of insecticides that selectively target insects by affecting calcium homeostasis. While this class of insecticides are effective on a wide range of insect pests, the toxicities of diamide insecticides vary among species and life stages. In this study, we addressed the mechanism underlying the different responses of Plutella xylostella and Pieris rapae to diamide insecticides. The susceptibility to insecticides of P. xylostella and P. rapae larvae was assessed 2 and 4 days after exposure to chlorantraniliprole, cyantraniliprole, and tetrachlorantraniliprole. P. xylostella larvae treated with distilled water (Group A), chlorantraniliprole (Group B), cyantraniliprole (Group C), and tetrachlorantraniliprole (Group D) and P. rapae larvae treated with distilled water (Group E), chlorantraniliprole (Group F), cyantraniliprole (Group G) and tetrachlorantraniliprole (Group H) were subjected to metabolomics analysis. The differential metabolites in the B vs. F, C vs. G, and D vs. H groups were analyzed, followed by pathway enrichment analysis. Chlorantraniliprole, cyantraniliprole, and tetrachlorantraniliprole all showed high toxicities for P. xylostella and P. rapae larvae. P. rapae larvae were more sensitive to the diamide insecticides than P. xylostella larvae. There were 65 overlapped differential metabolites between P. xylostella and P. rapae larvae treated with these three diamide insecticides. Pathway analysis showed that the differential metabolites were closely related with fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism-related pathways. The differential regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism may contribute to the different response to diamide insecticides in P. xylostella and P. rapae.","Wang, Dongsheng; Lv, Weiguang; Yuan, Yongda; Zhang, Tianshu; Teng, Haiyuan; Losey, John E; Chang, Xiaoli",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888611/,264
129834,"Acute effects of coffee consumption on self-reported gastrointestinal symptoms, blood pressure and stress indices in healthy individuals.",2016,"BACKGROUND During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, a critical care outreach team was implemented in our hospital to guarantee multidisciplinary patient assessment at admission and prompt ICU support in medical wards. In this paper, we report the activity plan results and describe the baseline characteristics of the referred subjects. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated data from 125 subjects referred to the critical care outreach team from March 22 to April 22, 2020. We considered subjects with a ceiling of care decision, with those deemed eligible assigned to level 3 care (ward subgroup), and those deemed ineligible admitted to the ICU (ICU subgroup). Quality indicators of the outreach team plan delivery included number of cardiac arrest calls, number of intubations in level 2 areas, and ineffective palliative support. RESULTS We enrolled 125 consecutive adult subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. We did not report any emergency endotracheal intubations in the clinical ward. In the care ceiling subgroup, we had 2 (3.3%) emergency calls for cardiac arrest, whereas signs of ineffective palliative support were reported in 5 subjects (12.5%). Noninvasive forms of respiratory assistance were delivered to 40.0% of subjects in the ward subgroup (median 3 d [interquartile range (IQR) 2-5]), to 45.9% of subjects in the care ceiling subgroup (median 5 d [IQR 3-7]), and to 64.7% of subjects in the ICU subgroup (median 2.5 d [IQR 1-3]). Thirty of the 31 ward subjects (96.7%), 26 of the 34 ICU subjects, (76.4%), and 19 of the 61 ceiling of care subjects (31.1%) were discharged. CONCLUSIONS In the context of a hospital and ICU surge, a multidisciplinary daily plan supported by a dedicated critical care outreach team was associated with a low rate of cardiac arrest calls, no emergency intubations in the ward, and appropriate palliative care support for subjects with a ceiling of care decision.","Messina, Antonio; Pradella, Andrea; Alicino, Valeria; Neganov, Maxim; Mattei, Giacomo De; Coppalini, Giacomo; Negri, Katerina; Costantini, Elena; Protti, Alessandro; Azzolini, Elena; Ciccarelli, Michele; Aghemo, Alessio; Voza, Antonio; Greco, Massimiliano; Lagioia, Michele; Cecconi, Maurizio",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.08743; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33850047/,264

PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively examined FDG uptake in the WR/NP region in 534 patients with lymphoma as assessed by PET-CT used for both diagnosis and follow-up. RESULTS Forty-nine patients had FDG uptake in the WR/NP region by PET-CT performed after completion of a chemotherapy regimen. Biopsy was performed for 11 of these patients in whom the uptake was considered to be pathologic, and results indicated the presence of reactive follicular hyperplasia. It was considered to be physiologic in 38 patients. PET-CT was repeated after 1 year, and no significant difference was identified between the standardized maximum uptake values (SUVmax; P = .107). The initial diagnosis of 20 patients was made via biopsy performed in the WR/NP region. The SUVmax for the FDG uptake in these patients, asymmetry, SUVmax of the coexisting lymphadenopathies in the neck, and FDG uptake with a counterpart finding by CT were significantly higher than other groups (P = .047, .001, and .005). CONCLUSION When deciding whether to resample after treatment completion, it should be taken into account that, in addition to the SUVmax of the lesion, asymmetry, and the SUVmax of the coexisting lymphadenopathy in the neck, a crucial criterion is whether the FDG uptake has a counterpart finding by CT.","Kurtoğlu, Erdal; Göçer, Mesut","Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clml.2020.08.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917575/,264

131589,Multimodal Approach to Decision to Treat Critically Ill Patients With Periodic or Rhythmic Patterns Using an Ictal-Interictal Continuum Spectral Severity Score.,2018,"l-Lysine oxidase (LysOX) is a FAD-dependent homo-dimeric enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative deamination of l-lysine to produce α-keto-ε-aminocaproate with ammonia and hydrogen peroxide. LysOX shows strict substrate specificity for l-lysine, whereas most l-amino acid oxidases (LAAOs) exhibit broad substrate specificity for l-amino acids. Previous studies of LysOX showed that overall structural similarity to the well-studied snake venom LAAOs. However, the molecular mechanism of strict specificity for l-lysine was still unclear. We here determined the structure of LysOX in complex with l-lysine at 1.7 å resolution. The structure revealed that the hydrogen bonding network formed by D212, D315, and A440 with two water molecules is responsible for the recognition of the side chain amino group. In addition, a narrow hole formed by five hydrophobic residues in the active site contributes to strict substrate specificity. Mutation studies demonstrated that D212 and D315 are essential for l-lysine recognition, and the D212A/D315A double mutant LysOX showed different substrate specificity from LysOX. Moreover, the structural basis of the substrate specificity change has also been revealed by the structural analysis of the mutant variant and its substrate complexes. These results clearly explain the molecular mechanism of the strict specificity of LysOX and suggest that LysOX is a potential candidate for a template to design LAAOs specific to other l-amino acids.","Kondo, Hiroki; Kitagawa, Masaki; Matsumoto, Yuya; Saito, Masaya; Amano, Marie; Sugiyama, Shigeru; Tamura, Takashi; Kusakabe, Hitoshi; Inagaki, Kenji; Imada, Katsumi",Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.3946; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894626/,264

In an evaluation at 24 hospitals in 14 states,* the effectiveness of partial or full vaccination† with Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines against COVID-19-associated hospitalization was assessed among adults aged ≥65 years. Among 417 hospitalized adults aged ≥65 years (including 187 case-patients and 230 controls), the median age was 73 years, 48% were female, 73% were non-Hispanic White, 17% were non-Hispanic Black, 6% were Hispanic, and 4% lived in a long-term care facility. Adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19-associated hospitalization among adults aged ≥65 years was estimated to be 94% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 49%-99%) for full vaccination and 64% (95% CI = 28%-82%) for partial vaccination. These findings are consistent with efficacy determined from clinical trials in the subgroup of adults aged ≥65 years (4,5). This multisite U.S. evaluation under real-world conditions suggests that vaccination provided protection against COVID-19-associated hospitalization among adults aged ≥65 years.

MATERIALS AND METHODS An observational study with two phases was conducted at a U.S. Army Medical Center. Previously collected samples from January 2014 through December 2015 were compared to prospectively collected data from March 2016 through December 2017. All data were collected from a convenience sample of active duty, HIV-positive men who have sex with men. Concordance between provider-collected and self-collected extragenital screening (EGS) samples was evaluated. RESULTS The rate of detection using EGS was higher than previously found using urogenital screening alone. Our prospective analysis revealed that expanding screening to include extragenital sites increased rates of detection of GC and CT. Our rates of GC detection at the pharynx and rectum, and CT detection at the rectum, were higher than those reported in the literature for men who have sex with men. Rates of CT infection at the pharynx were comparable with those reported in the literature. Detection of GC at the pharynx was exactly concordant between self-collected and provider-collected samples. Concordance of GC and CT detection at the rectum was very good. The kappa coefficient for detection of CT at the pharynx was zero, which corresponded to 44 out of 45 concordant observations. CONCLUSIONS Prior to implementation of EGS at our institution, we missed the opportunity to detect a substantial number of GC/CT infections with urogenital screening alone. Our results suggest that self-collection is a reliable method of EGS as compared to provider collection of samples.","Chohonis, Kelly; Davis, Kepler; Calvano, Tatjana",Military medicine,https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usaa123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32591826/,264
132226,Effects of Alteplase for Acute Stroke on the Distribution of Functional Outcomes: A Pooled Analysis of 9 Trials.,2016,"OBJECTIVE We investigated how ventilation with low tidal volumes affects the pharmacokinetics of sevoflurane uptake during the first minutes of inhaled anaesthesia. METHODS Forty-eight patients scheduled for lung resection were randomly assigned to three groups. Patients in group 1, 2 and 3 received 3% sevoflurane for 3 min via face mask and controlled ventilation with a tidal volume of 2.2, 8 and 12 ml kg(-1), respectively (Phase 1). After tracheal intubation (Phase 2), 3% sevoflurane was supplied for 2 min using a tidal volume of 8 ml kg(-1) (Phase 3). RESULTS End-tidal sevoflurane concentrations were significantly higher in group 1 at the end of phase 1 and lower at the end of phase 2 than in the other groups as follows: median of 2.5%, 2.2% and 2.3% in phase 1 for groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively (P<0.001); and 1.7%, 2.1% and 2.0% in phase 2, respectively (P<0.001). End-tidal carbon dioxide values in group 1 were significantly lower at the end of phase 1 and higher at the end of phase 2 than in the other groups as follows: median of 16.5, 31 and 29.5 mm Hg in phase 1 for groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively (P<0.001); and 46.2, 36 and 33.5 mm Hg in phase 2, respectively (P<0.001). CONCLUSION When sevoflurane is administered with tidal volume approximating the airway dead space volume, end-tidal sevoflurane and end-tidal carbon dioxide may not correctly reflect the concentration of these gases in the alveoli, leading to misinterpretation of expired gas data.","de la Matta-Martín, M; López-Herrera, D; Luis-Navarro, J C; López-Romero, J L",Revista espanola de anestesiologia y reanimacion,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.redar.2013.06.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24373754/,264

It happened with Tuberculosis (TB) and is happening with COVID-19. Due to its dynamic nature, this group of diseases must be studied in the context of the social determinants of health. AIM To describe the epidemiological behavior of COVID-19 in response to the control strategies implemented by the Chilean Ministry of Health and its similarities with the socio-economic distribution of TB in the Metropolitan Region (MR) of Chile. MATERIAL AND METHODS The 2018 Tuberculosis rates and average income of districts belonging to the MR were described, as well as the incidence rates of COVID-19. A Pearson correlation analysis was applied between the rates of both diseases, to assess similarities in the epidemiological distribution patterns. RESULTS The RM accounts for over 50% of the total national cases of COVID-19. After the implementation of selective quarantines, only four districts in the RM managed to control the outbreak (those with the highest incomes). In the rest, a clear increase in cases was observed. The districts with the highest increase in cases were the most disadvantaged, and those with the highest TB rates during 2018, with a correlation coefficient of 0.6. CONCLUSIONS Control policies cannot deepen health inequalities. If vulnerable groups, as well as the factors that determine their health, are not properly identified, the consequences of the current pandemic could be even more devastating.","Olmos, Claudio; Stuardo, Valeria",Revista medica de Chile,https://doi.org/10.4067/s0034-98872020000700963; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33399681/,264
132725,Histological Clot Composition Is Associated With Preinterventional Clot Migration in Acute Stroke Patients.,2019,"OBJECTIVES Oesophageal carcinoma (EC) remains an aggressive disease. Despite extensive changes in therapeutic modalities, surgical resection remains the first choice therapy for curable oesophageal cancer patients. Anastomotic sites are prone to serious complications such as leakage, fistula, bleeding and stricture. Leakage of the anastomosis (AL) remains one of the main causes of postoperative morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this study was to identify predictors associated with postoperative leakage after Ivor Lewis oesophagectomy and its consequences in a single centre. METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of 412 Ivor Lewis oesophageal resections in a single institute between 2005 and 2014. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression have been used to identify predictors of AL and its impact on postoperative outcome and overall survival. Kaplan-Meier curve was used to analyse overall survival and log-rank analysis to determine odds ratio. RESULTS A total of 412 patients were evaluated. Mean age was 62 ± 11 years (77% male). Overall leak rate was 2.9%. In-hospital or 30-day mortality was 4.4%. Mean intensive care unit (ICU) stay was 1 day and mean hospital stay was 19 days. A history of renal failure, diabetes, higher American Society of Anaesthesiologists score and current cigarette and corticosteroid use were identified as predictors of AL on univariable analysis. Multivariable analysis identified active smoking [P = 0.05, odds ratio (OR) 4.34, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.98-19.28] and active corticosteroid use (P < 0.001, OR 15.8, 95% CI: 3.25-76.7) as independent significant predictors. A history of diabetes tended to be associated with a higher leakage rate but failed to reach statistical significance. AL was associated with a longer ICU and hospital stay and a significantly higher mortality (42% in the AL group vs 3% in the control group, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Anastomotic leakage after oesophagectomy is a major cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality. Identifying risk factors preoperatively can contribute to the prevention of postoperative complications.","Van Daele, Elke; Van de Putte, Dirk; Ceelen, Wim; Van Nieuwenhove, Yves; Pattyn, Piet",Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/icvts/ivv276; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26433973/,264

Among clinical and laboratory markers, assays that evaluate antibodies that inhibit receptor-binding domain ligation to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor (RBI) may provide a surrogate for viral neutralization assays. We evaluated RBI before and after a median of 34 days (IQR 33-40) of the second dose of SARS-CoV-2 Sinovac's CoronaVac (CN) or AstraZeneca/Oxford's AZD1222 (AZ) vaccines in 166 individuals. Both vaccines elicited high inhibitory titers in most subjects, 95% (158/166), with signal inhibition above 30% and 89% (127/143) with more than fourfold increase from pre-vaccination titers, but titers tend to decrease over time. Both post-vaccination inhibitory titers (95%, IQR 85-97% for AZ vs 79%, IQR 60-96% for CN, p=0.004) and pre/post titer increase (AZ 76% IQR 51-86% for AZ vs 47%, IQR 24-67% for CN, p<0.0001) were higher among AstraZeneca vaccinees. Previous serological reactivity due to natural infection was associated with high pre-vaccination signal inhibition titers.

We report the first clinical case of a NOTES transanal resection for rectal cancer using TEM and laparoscopic assistance, performed by a team of surgeons from Barcelona and Boston with extensive experience with NOTES and minimally invasive approaches to colorectal diseases. METHODS Transanal endoscopic rectal resection with total mesorectal excision using the TEM platform was performed in a 76-year-old woman with a T2N2 rectal cancer treated with preoperative chemoradiation. Laparoscopic visualization and assistance with retraction and exposure during rectosigmoid mobilization was provided through one 5-mm port, which was later used as the stoma site, and 2-mm needle ports, one of which was used as a drain site. The specimen was transected transanally followed by handsewn coloanal anastomosis. RESULTS The procedure was completed successfully with an operative time of 4 hours and 30 minutes. Mesorectal excision was complete. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on the fourth postoperative day. The final pathology demonstrated pT1N0 with 23 negative lymph nodes and negative proximal, distal, and radial margins. CONCLUSIONS NOTES transanal endoscopic rectosigmoid resection using TEM and laparoscopic assistance is feasible and safe.

Electrocardiogram and echocardiogram abnormalities all resolved by the 2-week outpatient follow-up cardiology visit. CONCLUSION While 73% of pediatric patients with MIS-C had evidence of abnormal cardiac testing on hospital admission in our study, all cardiac testing was normal by outpatient hospital discharge follow-up. Cardiac screening tests should be performed in all patients diagnosed with MIS-C given the high rate of abnormal cardiac findings in our study cohort.","Minocha, Prashant K; Phoon, Colin K L; Verma, Sourabh; Singh, Rakesh K",Clinical pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1177/0009922820961771; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32975439/,264

However, the regulation of CMTM3 expression and its function in hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the regulation of CMTM3 expression, function, and molecular mechanism in HFSCs. The re-expression of CMTM3 significantly suppressed the proliferation of HFSCs by inducing G1 cell cycle arrest and promoting apoptosis. Moreover, the downregulation of CMTM3 promoted HFSC proliferation. Treatment with sh_CMTM3 and incubation in a DHT culture medium had the most significant growth-promoting effect. It was hypothesized that transcriptome analysis using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in samples would enable the identification of unique protein-coding and non-coding genes that may help uncover the role of CMTM3. Multiple genes and pathways were involved in this process, including 168 common DEGs, such as CXCL8 and E-selectin, which is reportedly involved in multiple regulatory pathways. These results indicated that CMTM3 can function as HFSCs through the induction of a G1 cell cycle arrest and promoted apoptosis by mediating crosstalk between several pathways and transcription factors.

134102,"Pharmacotherapeutical strategies in the prevention of acute, vaso-occlusive pain in sickle cell disease: a systematic review.",2017,"Apocarotenoids are important signaling molecules generated from carotenoids through the action of carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCDs). These enzymes have a remarkable ability to cleave carotenoids at specific alkene bonds while leaving chemically similar sites within the polyene intact. Although several bacterial and eukaryotic CCDs have been characterized, the long-standing goal of experimentally visualizing a CCD-carotenoid complex at high resolution to explain this exquisite regioselectivity remains unfulfilled. CCD genes are also present in some archaeal genomes, but the encoded enzymes remain uninvestigated. Here, we address this knowledge gap through analysis of a metazoan-like archaeal CCD from Candidatus Nitrosotalea devanaterra (NdCCD). NdCCD was active toward β-apocarotenoids but did not cleave bicyclic carotenoids. It exhibited an unusual regiospecificity, cleaving apocarotenoids solely at the C14'-C13' alkene bond to produce β-apo-14'-carotenals. The structure of NdCCD revealed a tapered active site cavity markedly different from the broad active site observed for the retinal-forming Synechocystis apocarotenoid oxygenase (SynACO) but similar to the vertebrate retinoid isomerase RPE65. The structure of NdCCD in complex with its apocarotenoid product demonstrated that the site of cleavage is defined by interactions along the substrate binding cleft as well as selective stabilization of reaction intermediates at the scissile alkene. These data on the molecular basis of CCD catalysis shed light on the origins of the varied catalytic activities found in metazoan CCDs, opening the possibility of modifying their activity through rational chemical or genetic approaches.","Daruwalla, Anahita; Zhang, Jianye; Lee, Ho Jun; Khadka, Nimesh; Farquhar, Erik R; Shi, Wuxian; von Lintig, Johannes; Kiser, Philip D",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2004116117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747548/,264

This disturbs its protective functions and promotes the development of dermatoses. All these factors occur in the work environment of a laboratory diagnostician. The aim of the paper was to analyze selected skin parameters and skin lesions in the hands of laboratory diagnosticians. MATERIAL AND METHODS Overall, 50 laboratory diagnosticians employed in a laboratory in Kraków, Poland, took part in the study. After the interview, the skin pH and moisture content were examined. Measurements were performed on the dorsal side of the dominant hand using the Skin-ph-Meter® PH 905 and Corneometer® CM 825 devices. RESULTS The obtained moisture level values were qualified as dry or very dry skin, and the skin pH was within the reference range. No correlation between the skin pH value and the features examined (professional experience, the number of hours spent in protective gloves during the day, the number of hand washing episodes during the day) was not indicated. The level of skin moisture content seems to positively correlate with the time of wearing gloves. The use of hand moisturizers after each hand washing episode correlated with the level of skin moisture content.

The purpose of this study was to determine the rates, risk factors, and time of occurrence for cardiac complications within thirty days after primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty and total hip arthroplasty. METHODS The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data set from 2006 to 2011 was used to identify all total knee arthroplasties and total hip arthroplasties. Cardiac complications occurring within thirty days after surgery were the primary outcome measure. Patients were designated as having a history of cardiac disease if they had a new diagnosis or exacerbation of chronic congestive heart failure or a history of angina within thirty days before surgery, a history of myocardial infarction within six months, and/or any percutaneous cardiac intervention or other major cardiac surgery at any time. An analysis of the occurrence of all major cardiac complications and deaths within the thirty-day postoperative time frame was performed. RESULTS For the 46,322 patients managed with total knee arthroplasty or total hip arthroplasty, the cardiac complication rate was 0.33% (n = 153) at thirty days postoperatively. In both the total knee arthroplasty and total hip arthroplasty groups, an age of eighty years or more (odds ratios [ORs] = 27.95 and 3.72), hypertension requiring medication (ORs = 4.74 and 2.59), and a history of cardiac disease (ORs = 4.46 and 2.80) were the three most significant predictors for the development of postoperative cardiac complications. Of the patients with a cardiac complication, the time of occurrence was within seven days after surgery for 79% (129 of the 164 patients for whom the time of occurrence could be determined). CONCLUSIONS An age of eighty years or more, a history of cardiac disease, and hypertension requiring medication are significant risk factors for developing postoperative cardiac complications following primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty and total hip arthroplasty. Consideration should be given to a preoperative cardiology evaluation and co-management in the perioperative period for individuals with these risk factors.","Belmont, Philip J; Goodman, Gens P; Kusnezov, Nicholas A; Magee, Charles; Bader, Julia O; Waterman, Brian R; Schoenfeld, Andrew J",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

METHODS Four breast radiologists from Brigham and Women's Hospital trained two general practitioner physicians and five nurses in Rwanda over 9 total weeks of in-person training and 20 months of remote mentorship using electronic image review with e-mailed feedback. Independently recorded assessments were compared to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of trainee assessments, with radiologist assessments as the gold standard. We compared performance in the first versus second half of the training. RESULTS Trainees' performance on written knowledge assessments improved after training (57.7% versus 98.1% correct, P = .03). Mean sensitivity of trainee-performed ultrasound for identifying a solid breast mass was 90.6% (SD 4.2%) in the first half of the training (period 1) and 94.0% (SD 6.7%) in period 2 (P = .32). Mean specificity was 94.7% (SD 5.4%) in period 1 and 100.0% (SD 0) in period 2 (P = .10). Mean sensitivity for identifying a medium- or high-suspicion solid mass increased from 79.2% (SD 11.0%) in period 1 to 96.3% (SD 6.4%) in period 2 (P = .03).

Here, we aimed to provide the first comprehensive proteomic analysis of OC-EVs. We identified 398 proteins as present in all OC-EVs samples. The functional enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology terms and an Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that the identified proteins were involved in several cellular metabolic processes, including translation, synthesis, expression, and protein metabolism. Notably, the proteins were also involved in critical canonical pathways with essential functions in oocyte and embryo development, such as ERK/MAPK, EIF2, PI3K/AKT, and mTOR signaling.

METHODS Aggregate sick leave use for all VHA employees was monitored in near-real time during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and compared with historical data from 2004 to 2008. The ratio of sick leave use between clinical and nonclinical staff was examined. An autoregressive integrated moving average model was used to assess whether the pandemic had a significant effect on sick leave use. RESULTS The H1N1 influenza pandemic was associated with a significant effect on sick leave use in the VHA during the second wave of the pandemic. During this wave, the ratio of clinical to nonclinical sick leave use changed; clinical staff began taking more leave than nonclinical staff for 3 successive 2-week pay periods, with ratio measures of 1.004, 1.018, and 1.011, respectively. Using an autoregressive integrated moving average model with a pulse variable representing the pandemic, there was a significant effect on sick leave use. The average hours of sick leave used per full-time equivalent staff member per month increased by 0.3904 hours (P = .003) for clinical staff and 0.3898 hours (P = .01) for nonclinical staff over previous months during the first month of the second pandemic wave. CONCLUSIONS Work loss associated with a pandemic is an important indicator of disease activity and may be a more sensitive indicator of emerging strains than deaths. Monitoring sick leave use in near real time in a large national health care system may be an important early indicator of pandemic severity with practical implications that should be considered in addition to more traditional measures of influenza epidemic and pandemic severity.","Schult, Tamara M; Awosika, Ebi R; Hodgson, Michael J; Martinello, Richard A",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://doi.org/10.1001/dmp.2011.54; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21908701/,264

A case report study.,2000,"The modeling of protein assemblies at the atomic level remains a central issue in structural biology, as protein interactions play a key role in numerous cellular processes. This problem is traditionally addressed using docking tools, where the quality of the models is based on their similarity to a single reference experimental structure. However, using a static reference does not take into account the dynamic quality of the protein interface. Here, we used all-atom classical Molecular Dynamics simulations to investigate the stability of the reference interface for three complexes that previously served as targets in the CAPRI competition. For each one of these targets, we also ran MD simulations for ten models that are distributed over the High, Medium and Acceptable accuracy categories. To assess the quality of these models from a dynamic perspective, we set up new criteria which take into account the stability of the reference experimental protein interface. We show that, when the protein interfaces are allowed to evolve along time, the original ranking based on the static CAPRI criteria no longer holds as over 50% of the docking models undergo a category change (which can be either toward a better or a lower accuracy group) when reassessing their quality using dynamic information.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential risk factor contributing to CR-POPF following distal pancreatectomy (DP) and discuss the risk factors of pancreatic fistula in order to interpret the clinical importance. Methods In this retrospective study, 263 patients who underwent DP at Ningbo Medical Center Li Huili Hospital between January 2011 and January 2020 were reviewed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Patients' demographics and clinical parameters were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses to identify the risk factors contributing to CR-POPF. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results In all of the 263 patients with DP, pancreatic fistula was the most common surgical complication (19.0%). The univariate analysis of 18 factors showed that the patients with a malignant tumor, soft pancreas, and patient without ligation of the main pancreatic duct were more likely to develop pancreatic fistula. However, on multivariate analysis, the soft texture of the pancreas (OR = 2.381, 95% CI = 1.271-4.460, P=0.001) and the ligation of the main pancreatic duct (OR = 0.388, 95% CI = 0.207-0.726, P=0.002) were only an independent influencing factor for CR-POPF. Conclusions As a conclusion, pancreatic fistula was the most common surgical complication after DP. The soft texture of the pancreas and the absence of ligation of the main pancreatic duct can increase the risk of CR-POPF.","Wang, Gao Qing; Yadav, Dipesh Kumar; Jiang, Wei; Hua, Yong Fei; Lu, Cai De",Canadian journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/8874504; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33542910/,264

138491,Intensifying our focus on critical limb ischemia.,2021-04-01,"Due to the rapid expansion in microbial taxonomy, precise identification of common industrially and agriculturally relevant fungi such as Trichoderma species is challenging. In this study, we introduce the on-line multiloci identification system (MIST) for automated detection of three hundred and forty-nine Trichoderma species based on a set of three DNA barcodes. MIST is based on the reference databases of validated sequences of three commonly used phylogenetic markers collected from public databases. The databases consist of four hundred and sixteen complete sequences of the nuclear rRNA internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 (ITS), five hundred and eighty-three sequence fragments of the gene encoding translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1) and five hundred and thirty-four sequence fragments of the gene encoding RNA polymerase subunit 2 (rpb2). Through MIST, information from different DNA barcodes can be combined and the identification of Trichoderma species can be achieved based on the integrated parametric sequence similarity search (blastn) performed in the manner of a decision tree classifier. In the verification process, MIST provided correct identification for forty-four Trichoderma spp. based on DNA barcodes consisting from tef1 and rpb2 markers. Thus, MIST can be used to obtain an automated species identification as well as to retrieve sequences required for the manual identification by means of phylogenetic analysis.IMPORTANCE The genus Trichoderma is important to human kind, with a wide range of applications in industry, agriculture and bioremediation. Thus, quick and accurate identification of Trichoderma species is paramount since it is usually the first step in Trichoderma-based research. However, it frequently becomes a limitation, especially for researchers who lack taxonomic knowledge of fungi. Moreover, as the number of Trichoderma-based studies has increased, a growing number of unidentified sequences have been stored in public databases, which has made the species identification more ambiguous. In this study, we provide an easy to use tool for automated species identification (MIST), a list of Trichoderma species, and corresponding sequences of reference DNA barcodes. Therefore, this study will facilitate the research on the biodiversity and applications of the genus Trichoderma.","Dou, Kai; Lu, Zhixiang; Wu, Qiong; Ni, Mi; Yu, Chuanjin; Wang, Meng; Li, Yaqian; Wang, Xinhua; Xie, Huilan; Chen, Jie; Zhang, Chulong",Applied and environmental microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.01532-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680870/,264

Our aim was to systematically review the long-term complications of appendectomy for acute appendicitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS This systematic review was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42017064662). The databases PubMed and EMBASE were searched for original reports on appendectomy with n ≥ 500 and follow-up >30 days. The surgical outcomes were ileus and incisional hernia; other outcomes were inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, fertility, and mortality. RESULTS We included 37 studies. The pooled estimate of the ileus prevalence was 1.0% over a follow-up period of 4.6 (range, 0.5-15) years. Regarding incisional hernia, we found a pooled estimate of 0.7% prevalence within a follow-up period of 6.5 (range, 1.9-10) years. Ulcerative colitis had a pooled estimate of 0.15% prevalence in the appendectomy group and 0.19% in controls. The opposite pattern was found regarding Crohn's disease with a pooled estimate of 0.20% prevalence in the appendectomy group and 0.12% in controls. No clear pattern was found regarding most of the examined cancers in appendectomy groups compared with background populations. Pregnancy rates increased after appendicitis compared with controls in most studies. Mortality was low after appendectomy. CONCLUSION Appendectomy had a low prevalence of long-term surgical complications. We did not find any significant other long-term complications, though the prevalence of Crohn's disease was higher and the prevalence of ulcerative colitis was lower after appendectomy than in controls. Appendectomy did not impair fertility.","Rasmussen, T; Fonnes, S; Rosenberg, J",Scandinavian journal of surgery : SJS : official organ for the Finnish Surgical Society and the Scandinavian Surgical Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/1457496918772379; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29764306/,264
140145,Serum prealbumin deserves more significance in the early triage of COVID-19 patients.,2020-07-20,"Background Polyphenols possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties and have been used in the treatment of skin wounds and burns. We previously showed that tannic acid-modified AgNPs sized >26 nm promote wound healing, while tannic acid-modified AgNPs sized 13 nm can elicit strong local inflammatory response. In this study, we tested bimetallic Au@AgNPs sized 30 nm modified with selected flavonoid and non-flavonoid compounds for wound healing applications. Methods Bimetallic Au@AgNPs were obtained by growing an Ag layer on AuNPs and further modified with selected polyphenols. After toxicity tests and in vitro scratch assay in HaCaT cells, modified lymph node assay as well as the mouse splint wound model were further used to access the wound healing potential of selected non-toxic modifications. Results Tannic acid, gallic acid, polydatin, resveratrol, catechin, epicatechin, epigallocatechin, epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin gallate and procyanidin B2 used to modify Au@AgNPs exhibited good toxicological profiles in HaCaT cells. Au@AgNPs modified with 15 μM tannic acid, 200 μM resveratrol, 200 μM epicatechin gallate, 1000 μM gallic acid and 200 μM procyanidin B2 induced wound healing in vivo and did not lead to the local irritation or inflammation. Tannic acid-modified Au@AgNPs induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) - like re-epithelialization, while other polyphenol modifications of Au@AgNPs acted through proliferation and wound closure. Conclusion Bimetallic Au@AgNPs can be used as a basis for modification with selected polyphenols for topical uses. In addition, we have demonstrated that particular polyphenols used to modify bimetallic nanoparticles may show different effects upon different stages of wound healing.","Orlowski, Piotr; Zmigrodzka, Magdalena; Tomaszewska, Emilia; Ranoszek-Soliwoda, Katarzyna; Pajak, Beata; Slonska, Anna; Cymerys, Joanna; Celichowski, Grzegorz; Grobelny, Jaroslaw; Krzyzowska, Malgorzata",International journal of nanomedicine,https://doi.org/10.2147/ijn.s252027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764930/,264
140174,Noninvasive pacing during transfemoral implantation of the Edwards SAPIEN valve for tricuspid valve bioprosthesis stenosis.,2016,"Objective: To observe and compare the radiographs of spiral CT and cone-beam CT (CBCT) in the imaging of temporomandibular joint osteoarthrosis (TMJOA) and to explore the difference between CBCT and spiral CT in detection accuracy so as to provide references for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Methods: A total of 52 patients with TMJOA diagnosed in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, General Hospital of Chinese PLA, from January 2018 to December 2019 were selected. There were 10 males and 42 females, with an average age of 38.6 years (21-70 years). All patients underwent spiral CT and CBCT examinations. Two oral radiologists and two oral and maxillofacial surgeons measured and evaluated the joint spaces and condylar bone lesions of each side of temporomandibular joint. According to the presence or absence of osteoarthrosis, the patients were divided into osteoarthrosis group (92 sides) and non osteoarthrosis group (12 sides). The mean size of joint spaces and the detection rate of lesions were compared between the two groups. SPSS 20.0 was used to analyze the data. Results: There was no significant difference between the measurements of joint space size and joint position in the spiral CT group and the CBCT group (P>0.05). The mean size of the anterior space and the ratio of the posterior condyle in the osteoarthrosis side were larger than that in the normal side. The LR index was smaller in the osteoarthrosis side than that in the normal side indicating that the position of the posterior condyle in the osteoarthrosis side was deviated. However, the difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05). Both spiral CT and CBCT showed good consistency in displaying condylar osteopathy. The most common types of condylar osteopathy was surface defect. The detection rates of defects by spiral CT were surface erosion (85.6%, 89/104), articular surface flattening and shortening (82.7%, 86/104), subcortical sclerosis (40.4%, 42/104), osteophyte (40.4%, 42/104) and subcortical cyst (11.5%, 12/104) respectively. The detection rates of defects by CBCT were surface erosion (88.5%, 92/104), articular surface flattening and shortening (86.5%, 90/104), subcortical sclerosis (35.6%, 37/104), osteophyte (41.3%, 43/104) and subcortical cyst (11.5%, 12/104). There was no statistical difference between the two groups (P>0.05), respectively. Conclusions: Both spiral CT and CBCT showed good accuracies in displaying the osteopathy of TMJOA and the sizes of the joint spaces measured by spiral CT and CBCT were basically the same. Both spiral CT and CBCT could be used as a routine diagnostic method for TMJOA.","Liu, H H; Bi, W T; Li, Y F; Wang, J Z; Wang, Z W; Hu, M",Zhonghua kou qiang yi xue za zhi = Zhonghua kouqiang yixue zazhi = Chinese journal of stomatology,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112144-20210317-00123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34404139/,264
140317,Coronavirus - preventing an occupational hazard among doctors.,2020-04-20,"BACKGROUND Robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy (RALH) is associated with improved outcomes compared to open surgery in patients with endometrial cancer but data are conflicting when comparing RALH to conventional total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH). In October 2014, a RALH program was established in Perth, Western Australia. AIM To compare outcomes in patients undergoing RALH with a matched cohort undergoing TLH. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective matched cohort study compared outcomes in 45 patients who underwent RALH with 45 controls who were patients treated with TLH. RESULTS Mean operating time was longer in the RALH group compared to controls (75.42 min vs 53.18 min, mean difference 22.24 min, P < 0.001, 95% Cl, 11.07-33.42). No differences were observed in mean pain scores (RALH 1.47 vs TLH 1.84 P = 0.31), mean parenteral and oral opioid use (RALH 14.3 mg and 42.4 mg vs TLH 17.5 mg and 52.57 mg, P = 0.42 and 0.42, respectively), and mean length of stay (RALH 1.51 vs TLH 1.67 days, P = 0.49). Two patients in the RALH group and one patient in the TLH group sustained iatrogenic bladder injuries (P = 0.62). CONCLUSION The establishment of the RALH program at our institution appeared to be associated with equivalent morbidity, post-operative pain, opioid use and length of stay compared to conventional laparoscopy. A surgical learning curve for RALH was observed. Well-designed prospective studies are needed to further evaluate short- and long-term patient function, morbidity, quality of life and oncologic outcomes.","Rajadurai, Vinita A; Tan, Jason; Salfinger, Stuart G; Cohen, Paul A",The Australian & New Zealand journal of obstetrics & gynaecology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ajo.12749; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29168558/,264
140484,Expansion of off-site percutaneous coronary intervention centres significantly reduces ambulance driving time to primary PCI in the Netherlands.,2020-07-20,"PURPOSE To compare clinical outcomes following sutureless Parietex™ ProGrip™ mesh repair to traditional Lichtenstein repair with lightweight polypropylene mesh secured with sutures. METHODS This is a 3-month interim report of a 1-year multicenter international study. Three hundred and two patients were randomized; 153 were treated with Lichtenstein repair (L group) and 149 with Parietex™ ProGrip™ precut mesh (P group) with or without fixation. The primary outcome measure was postoperative pain using the visual analog scale (VAS, 0-150 mm); other outcomes were assessed prior to surgery and up to 3 months postoperatively. RESULTS Compared to baseline, pain score was lower in the P group at discharge (-10%) and at 7 days (-13%), while pain increased in the L group at discharge (+39%) and at 7 days (+21%). The difference between groups was significant at both time points (P = 0.007 and P = 0.039, respectively). In the P group, patients without fixation suffered less pain compared to those with single-suture fixation (1 month: -20.9 vs. -6.15%, P = 0.02; 3 months: -24.3 vs. -7.7%, P = 0.01). The infection rate was significantly lower in the P group during the 3-month follow-up (2.0 vs. 7.2%, P = 0.032). Surgery duration was significantly shorter in the P group (32.4 vs. 39.1 min; P < 0.001). No recurrence was observed at 3 months in both groups. CONCLUSIONS Surgery duration, early postoperative, pain and infection rates were significantly reduced with self-gripping polyester mesh compared to Lichtenstein repair with polypropylene mesh. The use of fixation increased postoperative pain in the P group. The absence of early recurrence highlights the gripping efficiency effect.","Kingsnorth, A; Gingell-Littlejohn, M; Nienhuijs, S; Schüle, S; Appel, P; Ziprin, P; Eklund, A; Miserez, M; Smeds, S",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-012-0900-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22453675/,264

MATERIALS AND METHODS The TVEP consisted of an internal guide core and external sheath design using computer-aided design software. Transvesical peritoneoscopy, renal biopsy, as well as combined transvesical/transgastric nephrectomy were performed through the TVEP in a porcine model. Operative parameters and port performance were measured. RESULTS Twelve procedures were successfully performed by four surgeons. No complications occurred with introduction of the TVEP. The mean time for placement was 5.6 minutes. Steady pressure controlled CO(2) pneumoperitoneum up to 15 mm Hg with a flow of 2 L/min was achievable. The average scoring by physician of the TVEP was 4.75 for ease of placement, 5 for ability to maintain pneumoperitoneum, 4.25 for convenience of inserting instruments, and 4.5 for overall satisfaction. The average score regarding instruments exchangeability, however, was relatively low: 3.25.

140794,2020 Eberhard F. Mammen Award Announcements: Part I-Most Popular Articles.,2020-06-01,"Climate Change is adversely affecting health by increasing human vulnerability and exposure to climate-related stresses. Climate change impacts human health both directly and indirectly, through extreme weather events, changing distribution of health risks, increased risks of undernutrition, population displacement, and greater risks of injuries, disease, and death (Ebi, K., Campbell-Lendrum, D., & Wyns, A. The 1. 5 health report. WHO. 2018). This risk amplification is likely to increase the need for humanitarian support. Recent projections indicate that under a business as usual scenario of sustained greenhouse gas emissions, climate change could double the demand for humanitarian assistance by 2050 (World Health Organization. Operational Framework for building climateresilient health systems. WHO. 2015). Humanitarian assistance is currently not meeting the existing needs, therefore, any additional burden is likely to be highly challenging.Global health advocates, researchers, and policymakers are calling for urgent action on climate change, yet there is little clarity on what that action practically entails for humanitarian organizations. While some humanitarian organizations may consider themselves well designed to respond, climate change as a transversal threat requires the incorporation of a resilience approach to humanitarian action and policy responses.By bringing together authors from two historically disparate fields - climate change and health, and humanitarian assistance - this paper aims to increase the capacity of humanitarian organizations to protect health in an unstable climate by presenting an adapted framework. We adapted the WHO operational framework for climate-resilient health systems for humanitarian organizations and present concrete case studies to demonstrate how the framework can be implemented. Rather than suggest a re-design of humanitarian operations we recommend the application of a climate-lens to humanitarian activities, or what is also referred to as mainstreaming climate and health concerns into policies and programs. The framework serves as a starting point to encourage further dialogue, and to strengthen collaboration within, between, and beyond humanitarian organizations.","Nayna Schwerdtle, Patricia; Irvine, Elizabeth; Brockington, Sonia; Devine, Carol; Guevara, Maria; Bowen, Kathryn J",Globalization and health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00582-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32591000/,264
140876,"Living Donor Liver Transplantation During the COVID-19 Pandemic: ""Elective"" but ""Necessary"".",2020-09-02,"PURPOSE To investigate the relationship between follicular lymphoma (FL) risk and common modifiable lifestyle factors, specifically smoking, alcohol, body mass index (BMI), and hair dye use. METHODS We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies published prior to 01 January 2020. We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, and Web of Science and the reference lists of original studies and review articles. We used random-effects models to generate meta-estimates of relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS Twenty-four cohort and ten case-control studies were eligible. Ten articles examined smoking, 11 alcohol, 13 BMI, and four hair dye use and risk of FL. The meta-estimate for current smoking was 1.11 (95% CI 0.92-1.35; I2 = 51%) and there was no significant dose-response per 5-year increase in duration (p-trend = 0.087). Current alcohol intake was inversely associated with FL risk (meta-RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.81-0.94; I2 = 0%) and there was a significant dose-response per 5 drinks/week increase in intake (p-trend = 0.008). There was no association with 5 kg/m2 increase in early adulthood BMI (meta-RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.91-1.20; I2 = 7%) or being overweight (meta-RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92-1.07; I2 = 0%) or obese (meta-RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.99-1.17; I2 = 0%) as an adult. Hair dye use before 1980 was positively associated with FL risk (meta-RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.22-2.25; I2 = 55%) and no evidence of effect after 1980. CONCLUSION We found consistent evidence of an inverse association between current alcohol intake and FL risk, and a significant increased risk with hair dye use before 1980. The evidence for smoking is heterogeneous, but most studies did not support an association. Further research is required to understand the mechanisms underlying these associations and the potential for prevention strategies.","Odutola, Michael K; Nnakelu, Eriobu; Giles, Graham G; van Leeuwen, Marina T; Vajdic, Claire M",Cancer causes & control : CCC,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10552-020-01342-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32851495/,264
140982,Cryoneurolysis of Innervation to Sacroiliac Joints: Technical Description and Initial Results-A Case Series.,2021-03-30,"BACKGROUND Ligation with either absorbable or non-absorbable sutures has been the traditional state of the art, but a proliferation of technology now offers a host of methods to close and divide vessels. Only limited data are available that objectively compare different vessel sealing methods. The objective of this study was to compare a broad variety of methods of surgical vessel closure in a reproducible, independent, standardized test-to-failure ex vivo pressure challenge. METHODS Ten of the most common surgical sealing devices were represented in this study, including both mechanical and energy devices. Unfixed porcine carotid arteries were selected for testing. They were connected to a pump, and automated controlled infusion was initiated. Upon identification of a leak at the source of sealing, the maximum pressure in mmHg was logged. RESULTS There were a total of 184 trials conducted using the 10 vessel sealing methods. The average burst pressure across all trials was 1100 mmHg with a range of 51.3-5171 mmHg. Suture-based methods displayed the highest average pressure until failure. Stapling methods showed the lowest burst pressures. All methods showed mean burst pressures above the ""physiologically relevant"" level of 250 mmHg. CONCLUSIONS This study presents an independent, reproducible, ex vivo comparison of multiple methods of surgical arterial closure. In these laboratory conditions, tests to failure demonstrated widely varying sealing strength, highly dependent on method. All hemostatic modalities tested are capable of securing vessels safely and well above physiologic blood pressures, while suture-based methods were significantly stronger than other mechanical methods or modern energy devices.","Tharakan, Sasha J; Hiller, Dennis; Shapiro, Rachel M; Bose, Sourav K; Blinman, Thane A",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-016-4778-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26895898/,264
141475,Relevance of body mass index as a predictor of systemic therapy outcomes in metastatic melanoma: analysis of the MelBase French cohort data.,2020-12-29,"PURPOSE Patients, nowadays, prefer easy, low-risk, day-case procedures under local anesthesia for facial rejuvenation. Therefore, they favor facelift operations applied under local anesthesia. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 160 patients who underwent high superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) lamellar facelift under local anesthesia between 2010 and 2020 were included in this study. Patients operated under general anesthesia were excluded from this study. High SMAS lamellar facelift under local anesthesia was performed in all patients, consisting of 145 women and 15 men without any additional disease aged between 38 and 65 years. About 140 of these patients underwent primary facelift, whereas 20 of them had undergone SMAS plication more than 10 years ago. Lidocaine was used as a local anesthetic and the patients were not sedated. The duration of the operation was 80 minutes on average. The patients were left to rest for 1 hour after the operation and then sent home until their follow-up every other day for the first week. RESULTS This study shows that high SMAS facelift operations for the mid-face can easily be performed under local anesthesia under operating room conditions without sedation. However, an important point to keep in mind is that although the results of this surgery satisfy the patients, the outcomes do not entirely match the expectations from total face and neck lift performed under general anesthesia. High SMAS facelift with local anesthesia should be considered as an alternative for patients who do not want to undergo general anesthesia or who are at risk of undergoing general anesthesia. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, local anesthesia was considered much safer for the patients.Level of evidence: Level V.","Ors, Safvet",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/scs.0000000000007466; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33496520/,264

141852,Public reporting of PCI outcomes: for better or for worse.,2014,"Research from numerous corners of psychological inquiry suggests that self-assessments of skill and character are often flawed in substantive and systematic ways. We review empirical findings on the imperfect nature of self-assessment and discuss implications for three real-world domains: health, education, and the workplace. In general, people's self-views hold only a tenuous to modest relationship with their actual behavior and performance. The correlation between self-ratings of skill and actual performance in many domains is moderate to meager-indeed, at times, other people's predictions of a person's outcomes prove more accurate than that person's self-predictions. In addition, people overrate themselves. On average, people say that they are ""above average"" in skill (a conclusion that defies statistical possibility), overestimate the likelihood that they will engage in desirable behaviors and achieve favorable outcomes, furnish overly optimistic estimates of when they will complete future projects, and reach judgments with too much confidence. Several psychological processes conspire to produce flawed self-assessments. Research focusing on health echoes these findings. People are unrealistically optimistic about their own health risks compared with those of other people. They also overestimate how distinctive their opinions and preferences (e.g., discomfort with alcohol) are among their peers-a misperception that can have a deleterious impact on their health. Unable to anticipate how they would respond to emotion-laden situations, they mispredict the preferences of patients when asked to step in and make treatment decisions for them. Guided by mistaken but seemingly plausible theories of health and disease, people misdiagnose themselves-a phenomenon that can have severe consequences for their health and longevity. Similarly, research in education finds that students' assessments of their performance tend to agree only moderately with those of their teachers and mentors. Students seem largely unable to assess how well or poorly they have comprehended material they have just read. They also tend to be overconfident in newly learned skills, at times because the common educational practice of massed training appears to promote rapid acquisition of skill-as well as self-confidence-but not necessarily the retention of skill. Several interventions, however, can be introduced to prompt students to evaluate their skill and learning more accurately. In the workplace, flawed self-assessments arise all the way up the corporate ladder. Employees tend to overestimate their skill, making it difficult to give meaningful feedback. CEOs also display overconfidence in their judgments, particularly when stepping into new markets or novel projects-for example, proposing acquisitions that hurt, rather then help, the price of their company's stock. We discuss several interventions aimed at circumventing the consequences of such flawed assessments; these include training people to routinely make cognitive repairs correcting for biased self-assessments and requiring people to justify their decisions in front of their peers. The act of self-assessment is an intrinsically difficult task, and we enumerate several obstacles that prevent people from reaching truthful self-impressions. We also propose that researchers and practitioners should recognize self-assessment as a coherent and unified area of study spanning many subdisciplines of psychology and beyond. Finally, we suggest that policymakers and other people who makes real-world assessments should be wary of self-assessments of skill, expertise, and knowledge, and should consider ways of repairing self-assessments that may be flawed.","Dunning, David; Heath, Chip; Suls, Jerry M",Psychological science in the public interest : a journal of the American Psychological Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1529-1006.2004.00018.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26158995/,264
142157,Ex Vivo Anatomical Characterization of Handsewn or Stapled Jejunocecal Anastomosis in Horses by Computed Tomography Scan.,2014,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. While previous studies have shown that several SARS-CoV-2 proteins can antagonize the interferon (IFN) response, some of the mechanisms by which they do so are not well understood. In this study, we describe two novel mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 blocks the IFN pathway. Type I IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) were poorly induced during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and once infection was established, cells were highly resistant to ectopic induction of IFNs and ISGs. Levels of two key IFN signaling pathway components, Tyk2 and STAT2, were significantly lower in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Expression of nonstructural protein 1 (NSP1) or nucleocapsid in the absence of other viral proteins was sufficient to block IFN induction, but only NSP1 was able to inhibit IFN signaling. Mapping studies suggest that NSP1 prevents IFN induction in part by blocking IRF3 phosphorylation. In addition, NSP1-induced depletion of Tyk2 and STAT2 dampened ISG induction. Together, our data provide new insights into how SARS-CoV-2 successfully evades the IFN system to establish infection. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19, a serious disease that can have a myriad of symptoms from loss of taste and smell to pneumonia and hypercoagulation. The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 can be attributed in part to asymptomatic transmission, where infected individuals shed large amounts of virus before the onset of disease. This is likely due to the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to effectively suppress the innate immune system, including the IFN response. Indeed, we show that the IFN response is efficiently blocked during SARS-CoV-2 infection, a process that is mediated in large part by nonstructural protein 1 and nucleocapsid. Our study provides new insights on how SARS-CoV-2 evades the IFN response to successfully establish infection. These findings should be considered for the development and administration of therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.","Kumar, Anil; Ishida, Ray; Strilets, Tania; Cole, Jamie; Lopez-Orozco, Joaquin; Fayad, Nawell; Felix-Lopez, Alberto; Elaish, Mohamed; Evseev, Danyel; Magor, Katharine E; Mahal, Lara K; Nagata, Les P; Evans, David H; Hobman, Tom C",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00266-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34110264/,264

Since currently, there is no causative drug against this viral infection available, science is striving for new drugs and approaches to treat the new disease. Studies have shown that the cell entry of coronaviruses into host cells takes place through the binding of the viral spike (S) protein to cell receptors. Priming of the S protein occurs via hydrolysis by different host proteases. The inhibition of these proteases could impair the processing of the S protein, thereby affecting the interaction with the host-cell receptors and preventing virus cell entry. Hence, inhibition of these proteases could be a promising strategy for treatment against SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we discuss the current state of the art of developing inhibitors against the entry proteases furin, the transmembrane serine protease type-II (TMPRSS2), trypsin, and cathepsin L.","Müller, Patrick; Maus, Hannah; Hammerschmidt, Stefan Josef; Knaff, Philip; Mailänder, Volker; Schirmeister, Tanja; Kersten, Christian",Current medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.2174/0929867328666210526111318; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34042026/,264

REVIEW METHODS This review was conducted in according with the published protocol and PRISMA guidance. Randomised and non-randomised trials that compared a HEP to SEP, basic exercise advice or no exercise controls for IC were included. A narrative synthesis was provided for all studies and meta-analyses conducted using data from randomised trials. The primary outcome was maximal walking distance. Sub-group analyses were performed to consider the effect of monitoring. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool and quality of evidence via GRADE. RESULTS 23 studies with 1907 participants were included. Considering the narrative review, HEPs were inferior to SEPs which was reflected in the meta-analysis (MD 139m, 95% CI 45 to 232m, p = .004, very-low-quality evidence). Monitoring was an important component, as HEPs adopting this were equivalent to SEPs (MD: 8m, 95% CI -81 to 97, p = .86; moderate-quality evidence). For HEPs versus basic exercise advice, narrative review suggested HEPs can be superior, though not always significantly so. For HEPs versus no exercise controls, narrative review and meta-analysis suggested HEPs were potentially superior (MD: 136m, -2-273m p = .05, very-low-quality evidence). Monitoring was also a key element in these comparisons.Other elements such as appropriate frequency (≥3x a week), intensity (to moderate-maximum pain), duration (20 progressing to 60 minutes) and type (walking) of exercise were important, as was education, self-regulation, goal setting, feedback and action planning. CONCLUSION When SEPs are unavailable, HEPs are recommended. However, to elicit maximum benefit they should be structured, incorporating all elements of our evidence-based recommendations.

143628,A single- center experience of prolactin-producing pituitary adenomas without hyperprolactinemia: Its incidence and clinical management.,2020-08-03,"Biofouling is among the key factors slowing down healing of acute and chronic wounds. Here we report both anti-biofilm and wound-healing properties of the chitosan-immobilized Ficin. The proposed chitosan-adsorption approach allowed preserving ~90% of the initial total activity of the enzyme (when using azocasein as a substrate) with stabilization factor of 4.9, and ~70% of its specific enzymatic activity. In vitro, the chitosan-immobilized Ficin degraded staphylococcal biofilms, this way increasing the efficacy of antimicrobials against biofilm-embedded bacteria. In vivo, in the presence of Ficin (either soluble or immobilized), the S. aureus-infected skin wound areas in rats reduced twofold after 4 instead of 6 days of treatment. Moreover, topical application of the immobilized enzyme resulted in a 3-log reduction of S. aureus cell count on the wound surfaces in 6 days, compared to more than 10 days required to achieve the same effect in control. Additional advantages include smoother reepithelisation, and new tissue formation exhibiting collagen structure characteristics closely reminiscent of those observed in the native tissue. Taken together, our data suggest that both soluble and immobilized Ficin appear beneficial for the treatment of biofilm-associated infections, as well as speeding up wound healing and microbial decontamination.","Baidamshina, Diana R; Koroleva, Victoria A; Trizna, Elena Yu; Pankova, Svetlana M; Agafonova, Mariya N; Chirkova, Milana N; Vasileva, Olga S; Akhmetov, Nafis; Shubina, Valeriya V; Porfiryev, Andrey G; Semenova, Elena V; Sachenkov, Oskar A; Bogachev, Mikhail I; Artyukhov, Valeriy G; Baltina, Tatyana V; Holyavka, Marina G; Kayumov, Airat R",International journal of biological macromolecules,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.09.030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916198/,264
143672,Expert consensus document from the European Society of Cardiology on catheter-based renal denervation.,2013,"In this updated Self-care of Hypertension Inventory Version 3.0 (SC-HI v3.0), items were added to better reflect the Theory of Self-care of Chronic Illness and revised based on recent research. The reorganized and expanded SC-HI now reflects the theoretical concepts of self-care maintenance, monitoring, and management. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the psychometric properties of the SC-HI v3.0, we conducted exploratory factor analyses. Here, we report on its reliability and construct validity. METHODS A sample of 200 adults with chronic hypertension completed a sociodemographic survey and the SC-HI v3.0. Exploratory factor analyses were conducted on item sets using principal factor method for analyzing the correlation matrix. Reliability was calculated using common factor coefficient of determinacy for multidimensional scales, for which values greater than 0.80 are considered adequate. RESULTS The sample was 83.4% non-Hispanic White; 56% were women, with a mean age of 62.2 ± 12.5 years. The self-care maintenance scale (mean, 75.9 ± 13.6) had adequate reliability (ρ = 0.81, 0.80) for a 2-dimensional model of self-care maintenance identified as autonomous and consultative behaviors. The new self-care monitoring scale (mean score, 58.5 ± 21.99) had a single-factor solution with very good reliability (ρ = 0.94). The self-care management scale (mean score, 64.5 ± 19.5) had a single-factor solution, with moderate to strong factor loadings (0.22-0.68) and acceptable reliability (ρ = 0.84). CONCLUSIONS Initial testing suggests that the SC-HI v3.0 is a sound measure of the essential elements of self-care for adults with chronic hypertension. With the new self-care monitoring scale, the SC-HI v3.0 is a valid reflection of the theory on which it is based.","Dickson, Victoria Vaughan; Fletcher, Jason; Riegel, Barbara",The Journal of cardiovascular nursing,https://doi.org/10.1097/jcn.0000000000000827; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34117186/,264

145392,[Digital protocol for comprehensive planning of dental treatment. Clinical case analysis].,2021,"Purpose In this study, we described our initial experience and analyze the learning curve of segmental renal artery branch clamping with hand-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (PN) using special instruments. Materials and Methods We conducted a retrospective review of consecutive cases of hand-assisted laparoscopic PN (LPN) between May 2015 and April 2018. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, perioperative details, postoperative complications, and warm ischemic time for segmental artery branch clamping were included in our analysis. We used the cumulative sum (CUSUM) method to generate learning curves. Results Segmental renal artery branch clamping was successfully completed in 16 of 20 patients. The median tumor size was 2.9 cm (range, 1.7-7.0 cm), median operation time was 185 minutes (range, 140-245 minutes), median blood loss was 291 mL (range, 100-600 mL), and median hospital stay was 5 days (range, 4-7 days). The median selective ischemic time was 21 minutes (range, 16-35 minutes). No patient had postoperative complications, acute or delayed bleeding. The median pre- and postoperative serum creatinine levels (0.91 and 0.98 mg/dL, respectively), and the pre- and postoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (89.7 and 79.6 mL/min per 1.73 m2, respectively) were similar. Upon visual assessment of the CUSUM plots, a downward inflection point for decreasing total operation time was observed in the 9th case and estimated blood loss in the 12th case. Conclusions Our study shows that segmental renal artery branch clamping hand-assisted LPN for localized renal tumors is feasible, safe, and has a relatively short learning curve.","Tae, Bum Sik; Jeon, Byeong Jo; Kim, Nam Cheol; Choi, Hoon; Bae, Jae Hyun; Park, Jae Young",Investigative and clinical urology,https://doi.org/10.4111/icu.2019.60.2.99; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30838342/,264

Capitalizing on a 29-year longitudinal study with four previous assessments, two groups of Israeli veterans - ex-Prisoners-of-War (ex-POWs) of the 1973 Yom Kippur War and comparable combat veterans of the same war - were reassessed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous data were collected on their PTSD trajectory 18, 30, 35, and 42 years after the war and exposure to stressful life events after the war. Currently, we collected data on their PTSD during the COVID-19 pandemic and their appraisal of similarities of past trauma with the current pandemic. Previously traumatized ex-POWs were found to be more vulnerable and had significantly higher rates of PTSD and more intense PTSD during the current pandemic than comparable combat veterans. Moreover, veterans in both groups who perceived the current adversity (captivity, combat) as hindering their current coping were more likely to suffer from PTSD than veterans who perceived it as a facilitating or irrelevant experience. In addition, chronic and delayed trajectories of PTSD among ex-POWs increased the risk for PTSD during the pandemic, and lifetime PTSD mediated the effects of war captivity on PTSD during the current pandemic. These findings support the stress resolution perspective indicating that the response to previous trauma - PTSD and its trajectories - increased the risk of PTSD following subsequent exposure to stress.","Solomon, Zahava; Mikulincer, Mario; Ohry, Avi; Ginzburg, Karni",Journal of psychiatric research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.06.031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34198195/,264

Cases of TIM occlusion were collected and retrospectively reviewed. The analyzed objects included etiology, sites of tandem occlusion, collateral flow, location and size of infarcts. Combined with mechanical recanalization techniques and its complications, the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score and imaging data that was derived pre- and post-procedure were further contrasted. The study enrolled six patients with TIM occlusions. The mean NIHSS score on admission was 17 (range 13-20) and the median time from puncture to recanalization was 141 min (range 60-230). The substantial recanalization rate (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b or 3) was 83.3% and no symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage was observed. The mean NIHSS score after three days was 14 (range 10-19) and 9 (range 3-17) following discharge. However, one patient died of pulmonary infection one month after discharge. For the five patients who survived, the modified Rankin Scale was evaluated at three months, with scores of 3, 1, 3, 5 and 3, respectively. It is concluded that endovascular therapy for acute TIM occlusions are complex, MMRT may be relatively safe and effective.","Shao, Qiuji; Zhu, Liangfu; Li, Tianxiao; Wang, Ziliang; Li, Li; Bai, Weixing; He, Yingkun",The International journal of neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.3109/00207454.2015.1121387; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26577278/,264

146174,"Predictive capability of left atrial size measured by CT, TEE, and TTE for recurrence of atrial fibrillation following radiofrequency catheter ablation.",2010,"Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a clinical neurodegenerative syndrome with word finding problems as a core clinical symptom. Many aspects of word finding have been clarified in psycholinguistics using picture naming and a picture-word interference (PWI) paradigm, which emulates naming under contextual noise. However, little is known about how word finding depends on white-matter tract integrity, in particular, the atrophy of tracts located ventrally to the Sylvian fissure. To elucidate this question, we examined word finding in individuals with PPA and healthy controls employing PWI, tractography, and computer simulations using the WEAVER++ model of word finding. Twenty-three individuals with PPA and twenty healthy controls named pictures in two noise conditions. Mixed-effects modelling was performed on naming accuracy and reaction time (RT) and fixel-based tractography analyses were conducted to assess the relation between ventral white-matter integrity and naming performance. Naming RTs were longer for individuals with PPA compared to controls and, critically, individuals with PPA showed a larger noise effect compared to controls. Moreover, this difference in noise effect was differentially related to tract integrity. Whereas the noise effect did not depend much on tract integrity in controls, a lower tract integrity was related to a smaller noise effect in individuals with PPA. Computer simulations supported an explanation of this paradoxical finding in terms of reduced propagation of noise when tract integrity is low. By using multimodal analyses, our study indicates the significance of the ventral pathway for naming and the importance of RT measurement in the clinical assessment of PPA.","Janssen, Nikki; Roelofs, Ardi; Mangnus, Margot; Sierpowska, Joanna; Kessels, Roy P C; Piai, Vitória",NeuroImage.

While whole body cooling is a feasible approach in intubated and sedated patients, its application in awake stroke patients is limited by severe side effects: Strong shivering rewarms the body and potentially worsens ischemic conditions because of increased O2 consumption. Drugs used for shivering control frequently cause sedation that increases the risk of aspiration and pneumonia. Selective brain cooling by intraarterial cold infusions (IACIs) has been proposed as an alternative strategy for patients suffering from acute ischemic stroke. Preclinical studies and early clinical experience indicate that IACI induce a highly selective brain temperature decrease within minutes and reach targeted hypothermia 10 to 30 times faster than conventional cooling methods. At the same time, body core temperature remains largely unaffected, thus systemic side effects are potentially diminished. This review critically discusses the limitations and side effects of current cooling techniques for neuroprotection from ischemic brain damage and summarizes the available evidence regarding advantages and potential risks of IACI.","Esposito, Elga; Ebner, Matthias; Ziemann, Ulf; Poli, Sven",Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1038/jcbfm.2014.29; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24517972/,264

This paper outlines modifications made to Omran's original model and stages of transition, and suggests that without a focus on aetiology and morbidity, these have been basically descriptive rather than explanatory, and potentially misleading because infections have been confirmed as causes of various chronic diseases. Common infections and related immune responses or inflammatory processes contribute to the multifactorial aetiology of morbid conditions that together make a substantial contribution to overall mortality, and infectious causation is suspected for many others because of strong evidence of association. Investigation into possible infectious causes of conditions frequently recorded as the underlying cause of death can be integrated into a framework for comparative research on patterns of disease and mortality in support of public health and prevention. A theory of epidemiological transition aimed at understanding changes in disease patterns can encompass the role in different conditions and chronic diseases of infections contracted over the life course, and their contribution to disability, morbidity and mortality relative to other causes and determinants.","Mercer, A J",Epidemiology and infection,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268818000572; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29557320/,264

146543,Changes in body weight and blood pressure: paradoxical outcome events in overweight and obese subjects with cardiovascular disease.,2014,"INTRODUCTION The continual Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) threat highlights the importance of developing effective antiviral therapeutics to prevent and treat MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. A surface spike (S) protein guides MERS-CoV entry into host cells by binding to cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), followed by fusion between virus and host cell membranes. MERS-CoV S protein represents a key target for developing therapeutics to block viral entry and inhibit membrane fusion. Areas covered: This review illustrates MERS-CoV S protein's structure and function, particularly S1 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and S2 heptad repeat 1 (HR1) as therapeutic targets, and summarizes current advancement on developing anti-MERS-CoV therapeutics, focusing on neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and antiviral peptides. Expert opinion: No anti-MERS-CoV therapeutic is approved for human use. Several S-targeting neutralizing mAbs and peptides have demonstrated efficacy against MERS-CoV infection, providing feasibility for development. Generally, human neutralizing mAbs targeting RBD are more potent than those targeting other regions of S protein. However, emergence of escape mutant viruses and mAb's limitations make it necessary for combining neutralizing mAbs recognizing different neutralizing epitopes and engineering them with improved efficacy and reduced cost. Optimization of the peptide sequences is expected to produce next-generation anti-MERS-CoV peptides with improved potency.","Du, Lanying; Yang, Yang; Zhou, Yusen; Lu, Lu; Li, Fang; Jiang, Shibo",Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,https://doi.org/10.1080/14728222.2017.1271415; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27936982/,264

METHODS Patients ≥18 years of age with stage IV nonsquamous NSCLC (American Joint Committee on Cancer v7.0), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0/1 were randomized (1:1) to four cycles of induction Pem+Cb (pemetrexed, 500 mg/m, carboplatin, area under the curve = 6) followed by Pem maintenance or Pac+Cb+Bev (paclitaxel, 200 mg/m, carboplatin, area under the curve = 6, and bevacizumab, 15 mg/kg) followed by Bev maintenance in the absence of progressive disease or discontinuation. The primary objective was progression-free survival (PFS) without grade 4 toxicity (G4PFS). Secondary end points were PFS, overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and safety. Resource utilization was also assessed. RESULTS Baseline characteristics of the patients randomized to Pem+Cb (N = 182) and Pac+Cb+Bev (N = 179) were well balanced between the arms. Median (months) G4PFS was 3.91 for Pem+Cb and 2.86 for Pac+Cb+Bev (hazard ratio = 0.85, 90% confidence interval, 0.7-1.04; p = 0.176); PFS, OS, ORR, or DCR did not differ significantly between the arms. Significantly more drug-related grade 3/4 anemia (18.7% versus 5.4%) and thrombocytopenia (24.0% versus 9.6%) were reported for Pem+Cb.

147542,Oropharyngeal pH Testing Does Not Predict Response to Proton Pump Inhibitor Therapy in Patients with Laryngeal Symptoms.,2016,"BACKGROUND An estimated 49.8% of the world population will be myopic by 2050. Multifocal contact lenses (MFCLs) and orthokeratology (OK) reduce peripheral retinal hyperopic defocus, which animal studies have shown to positively impact eye growth. MFCLs are expected to slow myopic progression by 20 - 50% and OK by 30 - 60%, making them valuable therapeutic tools. In view of the guidelines for myopia management published by the International Myopia Institute in 2019, the aim of this retrospective data analysis of a tertiary care center was to review past experience with OK and MFCLs for myopia control and gain information to update current practice. PATIENTS AND METHODS The contact lens (CL) database of the Eye Clinic of the University Hospital of Basel was searched with the label ""myopia progression"" between January 2012 - 2020. Patients were included if they gave informed consent, were younger than 19 years old at baseline, and had no ocular comorbidities that could potentially compromise vision. Primary outcomes were progression of spherical equivalent refraction for MFCL patients and progression of axial length (AL) for the OK group, comparing with historical data from OK trials. Secondary outcomes were the presence of risk factors for myopia, age, refractive error at baseline, follow-up duration, and adverse effects during therapy. RESULTS Twenty-one patients could be included, with a mean age of 12.80 ± 3.32 years (y) at baseline. The majority of patients were older than 12 years and already myopic (- 3.89 ± 2.30 diopters) when control treatment was started. Overall, follow-up ranged from 0.08 to 6.33 years (2.03 ± 1.66 y). In the patients treated with MFCLs, myopia control improved significantly when patients changed from spectacles to MFCLs. In the OK group, 14% dropped out during the first year and 2 patients had multiple AL measurements during therapy, which showed a slower growth of AL when compared to other OK trials and controls with spectacles. There were two cases of non-severe keratitis. Environmental risk factors had not been documented and only 48% of clinical records had a documented family risk assessment. CONCLUSION Patients showed a slower myopia progression under MFCLs or OK, which supports their role as a treatment option in myopia management. In this regard, AL measurement is an important additional parameter to be included in the assessment of myopia progression in clinical practice. Identification of children at risk of developing high/pathologic myopia (family history, environmental risk factors) needs to improve so that the first stages of myopic shift can be recognized and targeted. Changes in lifestyle should be actively encouraged, especially when the impact of decreases in outdoor time secondary to COVID-19 is yet to become clear.","Reis, Ana Paula Ribeiro; Palmowski-Wolfe, Anja; Beuschel, Ralf",Klinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1440-0642; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33930921/,264
147555,Cohort profile: Thrombolysis in Ischemic Stroke Patients (TRISP): a multicentre research collaboration.,2018,"OBJECTIVE To assess the outcomes of a modified technique for pediatric laparoscopic orchidopexy performed without instrument trocars. METHODS A retrospective cohort study, for all laparoscopic orchidopexy performed without instrument trocars, was performed. Patient demographics, surgical technique, complications, and clinical outcomes were reviewed. All patients undergoing this procedure had a single trocar placed to insufflate and introduce the laparoscope. Skin punctures were used without trocars to introduce 3-mm instrumentation for laparoscopic orchidopexy. Initial follow-up visits were performed 2 to 4 weeks after surgery. Subsequent follow-up visits were performed at 6 to 12 months after surgery to reassess position and size of the testes. RESULTS A total of 22 patients with 27 undescended testes (20 right, 7 left) were identified. Median age was 1.3 years old (range, 5 months-7 years). Median operative time was 61 minutes (range, 42-81 minutes) for primary unilateral procedures (18 patients). Median operative time was 84 minutes (range, 75-90 minutes) for bilateral procedures (3 patients). All procedures were performed without additional trocars. There were no intraoperative complications. Patients were followed for 1 year and discharged. No patients were lost in follow-up. Postoperatively, 26 of 27 (96%) laparoscopic orchidopexy were successful. One patient developed atrophy with subsequent orchiectomy 6 months after the initial procedure. CONCLUSION Using skin punctures without trocars for laparoscopic orchidopexy is a safe and effective modification of standard laparoscopic orchidopexy.

However, the contribution of sigma1s to reovirus disease is unknown. To define the function of sigma1s in reovirus pathogenesis, we generated a sigma1s-deficient virus by altering a single nucleotide to disrupt the sigma1s translational start site. Viruses were recovered that contain nine gene segments from strain type 3 Dearing and either the wild-type or sigma1s-null S1 gene segment from strain type 1 Lang. Following peroral inoculation of newborn mice, both viruses replicated in the intestine, although the wild-type virus achieved higher yields than the sigma1s-null virus. However, unlike the wild-type virus, the sigma1s-deficient virus failed to disseminate to sites of secondary viral replication, including the brain, heart, and liver. Within the small intestine, both viruses were detected in Peyer's patches, but only the wild-type virus reached the mesenteric lymph node. Concordantly, wild-type virus, but not sigma1s-deficient virus, was detected in the blood of infected animals. Wild-type and sigma1s-null viruses produced equivalent titers following intracranial inoculation, indicating that sigma1s is dispensable for viral growth in the murine CNS. These results suggest a key role for sigma1s in virus spread from intestinal lymphatics to the bloodstream, thereby allowing the establishment of viremia and dissemination to sites of secondary replication within the infected host.","Boehme, Karl W; Guglielmi, Kristen M; Dermody, Terence S",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0907412106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19897716/,264
148634,Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm with retroperitoneal fibrosis.,2014,"BACKGROUND Specific treatment strategies are sorely needed for scirrhous-type gastric cancer still, which has poor prognosis. Based on the promising results of our previous phase II study (JCOG0210), we initiated a phase III study to confirm the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in type 4 or large type 3 gastric cancer. METHODS Patients aged 20-75 years without a macroscopic unresectable factor as confirmed via staging laparoscopy were randomly assigned to surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 (Arm A) or NAC (S-1plus cisplatin) followed by D2 gastrectomy plus adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 (Arm B). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). RESULTS Between October 2005 and July 2013, 316 patients were enrolled, allocating 158 patients to each arm. In Arm B, in which NAC was completed in 88% of patients. Significant downstaging based on tumor depth, lymph node metastasis, and peritoneal cytology was observed using NAC. Excluding the initial 16 patients randomized before the first revision of the protocol, 149 and 151 patients in arms A and B, respectively, were included in the primary analysis. The 3-year OS rates were 62.4% [95% confidence interval (CI) 54.1-69.6] in Arm A and 60.9% (95% CI 52.7-68.2) in Arm B. The hazard ratio of Arm B against Arm A was 0.916 (95% CI 0.679-1.236). CONCLUSIONS For type 4 or large type 3 gastric cancer, NAC with S-1 plus cisplatin failed to demonstrate a survival benefit. D2 surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy remains the standard treatment.","Iwasaki, Yoshiaki; Terashima, Masanori; Mizusawa, Junki; Katayama, Hiroshi; Nakamura, Kenichi; Katai, Hitoshi; Yoshikawa, Takaki; Ito, Seiji; Kaji, Masahide; Kimura, Yutaka; Hirao, Motohiro; Yamada, Makoto; Kurita, Akira; Takagi, Masakazu; Lee, Sang-Woong; Takagane, Akinori; Yabusaki, Hiroshi; Hihara, Jun; Boku, Narikazu; Sano, Takeshi; Sasako, Mitsuru",Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10120-020-01136-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33200303/,264
148749,"Elevated pro-brain natriuretic peptide, troponin T and malnutrition inflammatory score in chronic hemodialysis patients with overt cardiovascular disease.",2011,"Venous thromboembolism is common. Most pulmonary emboli arise as thromboses in the deep veins of the lower extremities and may result in serious complications. Inferior vena cava filters (IVCF) are intended to prevent the passage of deep vein thrombosis to the pulmonary arteries. Accepted indications for IVCF placement include the presence of acute venous thromboembolism with inability to administer anticoagulation medication or failure of anticoagulation. Despite these clear indications, IVCF have been commonly placed in patients for primary prevention of pulmonary emboli in patients deemed to be at high risk, along with several other ""soft"" indications. As a result, IVCF use has been rising over the past 2 decades, especially given the retrievable nature of modern devices. Nonetheless, IVCF are not free of complications, which may occur during implantation and retrieval and while retained in the body. Despite this increase in use, the long-term efficacy remains unclear, and the management of patients with retained filters is often controversial. Finally, filter retrieval in eligible patients is relatively infrequent, suggesting that systems must be in place to improve appropriate filter use and to increase retrieval.","Weinberg, Ido; Kaufman, John; Jaff, Michael R",JACC.

149060,Implications of INTERACT2 and other clinical trials: blood pressure management in acute intracerebral hemorrhage.,2015,"BACKGROUND Despite global prevention and quarantine efforts, the incidence of COVID-19 disease continues to increase. As a possible cause, our aim was to investigate which parameters increase the sensitivity or protection against COVID-19 between RT-PCR positive and RT-PCR negative cases in patients admitted to the emergency department. METHODS In the pandemic process, patients admitted to the hospital with suspicion of COVID-19 were evaluated retrospectively. RT-PCR test was divided into + (for Group 1) and - (Group 2). The gender, age, clinical information, application symptoms, and comorbidity data of the patients were evaluated. RESULTS One hundred and sixty-seven cases were evaluated in the study. Group 1: 88 cases, M/F ratio: 46/42 and average age 48 ± 17.3 years, Group 2: 79 cases, M/F ratio was approximately 3/2, and the average age was 48.3 ± 19.4 years. When the groups were compared in terms of symptoms, fever, cough, weakness, and headache were prominent in Group 1, whereas the contact was significantly higher in Group 2 (p < 0.05). Among the comorbid diseases, only COPD showed a significant difference between the groups, and it was found significantly higher in Group 2 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Cough, headache, and fever were found valuable in the detection of cases. Attention should be paid to contact isolation to circumvent the pandemic process with less damage. Having chronic diseases, especially COPD, increases the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2. Close monitoring and control of chronic diseases can positively change the course of COVID-19.","Akpinar, Guleser; Demir, Mehmet C; Sultanoglu, Hasan; Sonmez, Feruza T; Karaman, Kivanc; Keskin, Banu H; Ince, Nevin; Guclu, Derya",Clinical laboratory,https://doi.org/10.7754/clin.lab.2020.200844; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33865252/,264

By comparing systemic stress following multi-port (LC) and single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC), we aim to determine whether reduced incision size induces a reduced stress response. METHODS Thirty-five consecutive patients were included, 11 underwent SILC (mean ± SEM; age 44.8 ± 3.88 year; BMI 27 ± 1.44 kg/m(2)) and 24 underwent LC (56.17 ± 2.80 year; 31.72 ± 1.07 kg/m(2), p < 0.05). Primary endpoint measures included levels of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein measured pre- and post-operatively. Length-of-stay (LOS) and postoperative morbidity were secondary endpoints. RESULTS No statistically significant differences were found between SILC and LC for interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein levels, LOS and duration of surgery. There was also no correlation between systemic stress response and operative parameters. There were no intra-operative complications. CONCLUSION SILC appears to be a safe, feasible technique with potential advantages of cosmesis, reduced incisional pain, and well-being recommending its use. These data indicate no difference in systemic stress and morbidity between SILC and LC. A larger, multi-centred, randomised prospective trial is warranted to further investigate and confirm this finding.","McGregor, Colleen G C; Sodergren, Mikael H; Aslanyan, Alec; Wright, Victoria J; Purkayastha, Sanjay; Darzi, Ara; Paraskeva, Paraskevas",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-011-1432-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21308488/,264

Unlike the popular 3D pose estimation setting, the problem is often formulated as egocentric tracking based on embodied perception (e.g., egocentric cameras, handheld sensors). In this paper, we propose a new data-driven framework for egocentric body tracking, targeting challenges of omnipresent occlusions in optimization-based methods (e.g., inverse kinematics solvers). We first collect a large-scale motion capture dataset with both body and finger motions using optical markers and inertial sensors. This dataset focuses on social scenarios and captures ground truth poses under self-occlusions and body-hand interactions. We then simulate the occlusion patterns in head-mounted camera views on the captured ground truth using a ray casting algorithm and learn a deep neural network to infer the occluded body parts. Our experiments show that our method is able to generate high-fidelity embodied poses by applying the proposed method to the task of real-time egocentric body tracking, finger motion synthesis, and 3-point inverse kinematics.","Parger, Mathias; Tang, Chengcheng; Xu, Yuanlu; Twigg, Christopher David; Tao, Lingling; Li, Yijing; Wang, Robert; Steinberger, Markus",IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,https://doi.org/10.1109/tvcg.2021.3085407; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34061744/,264

The purpose of this study was to compare the usefulness of Silent MR angiography and time-of-flight MRA to assess the parent artery and the embolization state of the aneurysm after a flow-diverter placement. MATERIALS AND METHODS Seventy-eight large, unruptured internal carotid aneurysms in 78 patients were the subjects of this study. After 6 months of treatment, they underwent follow-up digital subtraction angiography, Silent MRA, and TOF-MRA, performed simultaneously. All images were independently reviewed by 2 neurosurgeons and 1 radiologist and rated on a 4-point scale from 1 (not visible) to 4 (excellent) to evaluate the parent artery. The aneurysmal embolization status was assessed with 2 ratings: complete or incomplete occlusion. RESULTS The mean scores of Silent MRA and TOF-MRA regarding the parent artery were 3.18 ± 0.72 and 2.31 ± 0.86, respectively, showing a significantly better score with Silent MRA (P < .01). In the assessment of the embolization of aneurysms on Silent MRA and TOF-MRA compared with DSA, the percentages of agreement were 91.0% and 80.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Silent MRA is superior for visualizing blood flow images inside flow-diverter devices compared with TOF-MRA. Furthermore, Silent MRA enables the assessment of aneurysmal embolization status. Silent MRA is useful for assessing the status of large and giant unruptured internal carotid aneurysms after flow-diverter placement.","Oishi, H; Fujii, T; Suzuki, M; Takano, N; Teranishi, K; Yatomi, K; Kitamura, T; Yamamoto, M; Aoki, S; Arai, H",AJNR.

Most problematic and troublesome are defects, where major part of abdominal wall had to be resected and tissue for transfer or reconstruction is absent. CASE PRESENTATION Authors of the article present operative technique, in which reconstruction of abdominal wall was managed by composite polypropylene mesh with absorbable collagen film, creation of granulation tissue with use of NPWT (negative pressure wound therapy), and subsequent split skin grafting.Three patients with massive abdominal wall defect were successfully managed and abdominal wall reconstruction was performed by mentioned technique. Functional and cosmetic effect is acceptable and patients have good postoperative quality of life. CONCLUSIONS Patients with giant abdominal defects can benefit from described technique. It serves as the only option, with which abdominal wall is fully reconstructed without need for the secondary intervention.","Hutan, Martin; Bartko, Christian; Majesky, Ivan; Prochotsky, Augustin; Sekac, Jaroslav; Skultety, Jan",BMC surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2482-14-50; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25103782/,264

151405,Sedation vs Intubation for Patients With Acute Stroke Undergoing Thrombectomy.,2017,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE To address the increasing need to counsel patients about treatment indications for unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIA), we endeavored to develop a consensus on assessment of UIAs among a group of specialists from diverse fields involved in research and treatment of UIAs. METHODS After composition of the research group, a Delphi consensus was initiated to identify and rate all features, which may be relevant to assess UIAs and their treatment by using ranking scales and analysis of inter-rater agreement (IRA) for each factor. IRA was categorized as very high, high, moderate, or low. RESULTS Ultimately, 39 specialists from 4 specialties agreed (high or very high IRAs) on the following key factors for or against UIA treatment decisions: (1) patient age, life expectancy, and comorbid diseases; (2) previous subarachnoid hemorrhage from a different aneurysm, family history for UIA or subarachnoid hemorrhage, nicotine use; (3) UIA size, location, and lobulation; (4) UIA growth or de novo formation on serial imaging; (5) clinical symptoms (cranial nerve deficit, mass effect, and thromboembolic events from UIAs); and (6) risk factors for UIA treatment (patient age and life expectancy, UIA size, and estimated risk of treatment). However, IRAs for features rated with low relevance were also generally low, which underlined the existing controversy about the natural history of UIAs. CONCLUSIONS Our results highlight that neurovascular specialists currently consider many features as important when evaluating UIAs but also highlight that the appreciation of natural history of UIAs remains uncertain, even within a group of highly informed individuals.","Etminan, Nima; Beseoglu, Kerim; Barrow, Daniel L; Bederson, Joshua; Brown, Robert D; Connolly, E Sander; Derdeyn, Colin P; Hänggi, Daniel; Hasan, David; Juvela, Seppo; Kasuya, Hidetoshi; Kirkpatrick, Peter J; Knuckey, Neville; Koivisto, Timo; Lanzino, Giuseppe; Lawton, Michael T; LeRoux, Peter; McDougall, Cameron G; Mee, Edward; Mocco, J; Molyneux, Andrew; Morgan, Michael K; Mori, Kentaro; Morita, Akio; Murayama, Yuichi; Nagahiro, Shinji; Pasqualin, Alberto; Raabe, Andreas; Raymond, Jean; Rinkel, Gabriel J E; Rüfenacht, Daniel; Seifert, Volker; Spears, Julian; Steiger, Hans-Jakob; Steinmetz, Helmuth; Torner, James C; Vajkoczy, Peter; Wanke, Isabel; Wong, George K C; Wong, John H; Macdonald, R Loch",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.114.004519; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24668202/,264

No clear policies regarding the authority and responsibility of nursing staff in the treatment of ECMO-supported patients are currently available. OBJECTIVE To formulate evidence-based recommendations for nursing care of ECMO-supported patients. METHODS The National Head Nurse's office and the Professional Guidelines Department in the Nursing Division of Israel's Ministry of Health formed the Professional Advisory Committee on Nursing Practice in the Care of ECMO-Supported Patients to address concerns regarding the current state of professional nursing practice in the care of these patients. The Professional Advisory Committee brought together 15 senior Israeli ECMO nursing experts who explored the potential of registered nurses in caring for ECMO-supported patients, considered the competencies of nurses treating ECMO-supported patients, discussed training programs and health care policy, and examined nursing outcomes for quality assurance. RESULTS The Professional Advisory Committee formulated recommendations regarding the following priority issues: (1) determining boundaries of professional authority and nurses' responsibilities, including designated activities for different professional ranks of registered nurses; (2) providing appropriate content for the training programs offered, such as generic/basic, above-basic, and clinical specialization nursing programs; and (3) defining relevant quality measures for nursing treatment of ECMO-supported patients.

152409,General anesthesia improves contact force and reduces gap formation in pulmonary vein isolation: a comparison with conscious sedation.,2017,"BACKGROUND Hypertension (HPT) and its complications continue to pose a global threat and contribute to premature mortality worldwide. The adverse interactions between HPT, obesity and COVID-19 are currently being witnessed globally and represent a collision of pandemics. Understanding the burden that this non-communicable disease (NCD) poses in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Province, South Africa (SA), would help in developing improved public healthcare strategies. OBJECTIVES To describe the burden of HPT in all the districts of KZN over a 6-year period. METHODS HPT data are routinely collected from all KZN public health facilities (both clinics and hospitals) as part of the District Health Information System (DHIS). In this retrospective study, we accessed HPT records from the DHIS over a period of 6 years (2014 - 2019, inclusive). Data collected included the number of patients screened, diagnosed and initiated on therapy for HPT, together with the number of obese patients. RESULTS The slopes for HPT screening were positive at both clinics and hospitals in KZN (considerably more at clinics than hospitals, with a difference in elevations of slopes of p<0.001), with a significantly greater percentage of the population having been screened at rural clinics than at hospitals (difference in elevation of slopes p<0.001). A significantly greater number of patients aged <40 years (p<0.001) were being screened for HPT at clinics than at hospitals (2017/18, 2018/19, 2019/20), while hospitals screened considerably more patients aged ≥40 years in 2017 - 2018 (p<0.001). The numbers of new hypertensives diagnosed and having treatment initiated were on an upward slope at both clinics and hospitals, with clinics having a greater elevation of slope than hospitals (p<0.001), irrespective of patient age. A significantly greater number of patients aged ≥40 years (p<0.05) were diagnosed with HPT at both clinics and hospitals in KZN (2017/18, 2018/19, 2019/20). KZN clinics remained the first port of call for known hypertensives throughout the study period. Obesity was prevalent at both clinic and hospital level, although figures were significantly higher at clinics. Over 80% of the obesity burden was carried by the rural clinics and hospitals. CONCLUSIONS Screening, diagnosis, treatment initiation and chronic management of HPT occur mainly at rural clinic level. The SA government needs to heed these findings and redirect resources (staffing and equipment) to this level. The prevalence of obesity was highest at rural healthcare facilities (clinics more than hospitals). More needs to be done to combat the obesity pandemic if we are to win the battle against NCDs (HPT and diabetes mellitus). A significant number of patients aged <40 years are being screened for HPT, which bodes well for the province, as early diagnosis and treatment of HPT are vital to prevent complications.","Pillay, S; Pillay, D; Pillay, R S",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,https://doi.org/10.7196/samj.2021.v111i2.15056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33944727/,264

The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of different new-generation pulse oximeters during intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) therapy. METHODS In the experimental setting, the validity of three pulse oximetry technologies (Masimo Radical 7, Nellcor N-600 and Datex Ohmeda TruSat) was evaluated in patients with IABP treatment. Arterial blood gas analysis (BGA-SaO2) data were compared with the pulse oximetric values (SpO2) during 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 support ratio. RESULTS The mean differences (bias) during 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 IABP support between BGA-SaO2 and Datex-SpO2 were 3.38% [95% confidence intervals (CI):±1.39%], 1.41% (95% CI 1.14%) and 2.10% (95% CI:±0.94%), respectively. Between BGA-SaO2 and Nellcor-SpO2, a bias of 0.77% (95% CI:±0.46%), 0.85% (95% CI:±0.40%) and 0.59% (95% CI:±0.38%) was found.

The GI epithelium also contributes to the poor permeability of numerous antioxidant agents. Thus, lipophilic vitamins do not readily dissolve in the GI tract, and therefore they have low bioavailability. Nanomedicine has the potential to improve the delivery efficiency of oral vitamins. In particular, the use of lipid nanocarriers for certain vitamins that are administered orally can provide improved solubility, chemical stability, epithelium permeability and bioavailability, half-life, nidus targeting, and fewer adverse effects. These lipid nanocarriers include self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDSs), nanoemulsions, microemulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs). The use of nontoxic excipients and sophisticated material engineering of lipid nanosystems allows for control of the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles and improved GI permeation via mucosal or lymphatic transport. In this review, we highlight recent progress in the development of lipid nanocarriers for vitamin delivery. In addition, the same lipid nanocarriers used for vitamins may also be effective as carriers of vitamin derivatives, and therefore enhance their oral bioavailability. One example is the incorporation of d-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS) as the emulsifier in lipid nanocarriers to increase the solubility and inhibit P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux.

This support was prepared by sequentially reacting 5 μm silica particles with vinyltrimethoxysilane and then thioglycolic acid. The carboxy-silica thus obtained was subsequently functionalized with octadecylamine, 2-naphthylamine or 2-aminoanthracene by on-column reactions via a carbodiimide conjugation reaction. The carbodiimide with its zero-length carboxyl-to-amine coupling ability works by activating the surface carboxyl groups of the precursor support for direct reaction with the primary amines of octadecylamine, 2-naphthylamine or 2-aminoanthracene via amide bond formation. These reactions series, which are applied for the first time in HPLC column fabrication, yielded the octadecyl-, naphthyl- and anthracenyl-silica columns. The three columns were evaluated for their reversed-phase chromatography retention properties with alkylbenzenes, alkylphenyl ketones, nitroalkanes, benzene and toluene derivatives, polyaromatic hydrocarbons and nitro-substituted amino acids. The naphthyl- and anthracenyl-silica exhibited a good selectivity and efficiency towards most of the aromatic analytes when compared to the octadecyl-silica. Nitro-substituted amino acids containing electron withdrawing groups showed greater selectivity than other analytes on the aromatic-based columns than the C18 column. This is because of the ability of the π electron system of the analyte to accept electrons from the aromatic-based stationary phase (a Lewis base). This article is protected by copyright.

153447,Examining the Effect of Travel Distance to Pediatric Cancer Centers and Rurality on Survival and Treatment Experiences: A Systematic Review.,2021-02-22,"OBJECTIVE There are concerns of a high barotrauma rate in coronavirus disease 2019 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. However, a few studies were published, and reported rates were highly variable. We performed a systematic literature review to identify rates of barotrauma, pneumothorax, and pneumomediastinum in coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. DATA SOURCE PubMed and Scopus were searched for studies reporting barotrauma event rate in adult coronavirus disease 2019 patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. STUDY SELECTION We included all studies investigating adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation. Case reports, studies performed outside ICU setting, and pediatric studies were excluded. Two investigators independently screened and selected studies for inclusion. DATA EXTRACTION Two investigators abstracted data on study characteristics, rate of pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and overall barotrauma events, and mortality. When available, data from noncoronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome patients were also collected. Pooled estimates for barotrauma, pneumothorax, and pneumomediastinum were calculated. DATA SYNTHESIS A total of 13 studies with 1,814 invasively ventilated coronavirus disease 2019 patients and 493 noncoronavirus disease 2019 patients were included. A total of 266/1,814 patients (14.7%) had at least one barotrauma event (pooled estimates, 16.1% [95% CI, 11.8-20.4%]). Pneumothorax occurred in 132/1,435 patients (pooled estimates, 10.7%; 95% CI, 6.7-14.7%), whereas pneumomediastinum occurred in 162/1,432 patients (pooled estimates, 11.2%; 95% CI, 8.0-14.3%). Mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 patients who developed barotrauma was 111/198 patients (pooled estimates, 61.6%; 95% CI, 50.2-73.0%). In noncoronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome patients, barotrauma occurred in 31/493 patients (6.3%; pooled estimates, 5.7%; 95% CI, -2.1% to 13.5%). CONCLUSIONS Barotrauma occurs in one out of six coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and is associated with a mortality rate of about 60%. Barotrauma rate may be higher than noncoronavirus disease 2019 controls.","Belletti, Alessandro; Todaro, Gabriele; Valsecchi, Gabriele; Losiggio, Rosario; Palumbo, Diego; Landoni, Giovanni; Zangrillo, Alberto",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000005283; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34637421/,264

To address these issues, we conducted a series of experiments that combined the rubber hand illusion (RHI) and the ""body swap illusion."" The subject wore a head mounted display (HMD) connected with a stereo camera set on the experimenter's head. Sitting face to face, they used their right hand holding a paintbrush to brush each other's left hand. Through the HMD, the subject adopted the experimenter's first-person perspective (1PP) as if it was his/her own 1PP: the subject watched either the experimenter's hand from the adopted 1PP, and/or the subject's own hand from the adopted third-person perspective (3PP) in the opposite direction (180°), or the subject's full body from the adopted 3PP (180°, with or without face). The synchronous full-body conditions generate a ""self-touching illusion"": many participants felt that ""I was brushing my own hand!"" We found that (1) the sense of body-part ownership and the sense of full-body ownership are not fundamentally different from each other; and (2) our data present a strong case against the mainstream philosophical view called the immunity principle (IEM). We argue that it is possible for misrepresentation to occur in the subject's sense of ""experiential ownership"" (the sense that I am the one who is having this bodily experience). We discuss these findings and conclude that not only the sense of body ownership but also the sense of experiential ownership call for further interdisciplinary studies.","Liang, Caleb; Chang, Si-Yan; Chen, Wen-Yeo; Huang, Hsu-Chia; Lee, Yen-Tung",Frontiers in psychology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01591; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25774138/,264

To evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on harm reduction services for adolescents and young adults in Boston, we conducted a quantitative assessment of the Community Care in Reach (CCIR) youth pilot program to determine gaps in services created by its closure during the peak of the pandemic (March 19-June 21, 2020). We also conducted semistructured interviews with staff members at 6 harm reduction programs in Boston from April 27 through May 4, 2020, to identify gaps in harm reduction services, changes in substance use practices and patterns of engagement with people who use drugs, and how harm reduction programs adapted to pandemic conditions. During the pandemic, harm reduction programs struggled to maintain staffing, supplies, infection control measures, and regular connection with their participants. During the 3-month suspension of CCIR mobile van services, CCIR missed an estimated 363 contacts, 169 units of naloxone distributed, and 402 syringes distributed. Based on our findings, we propose the following recommendations for sustaining harm reduction services during times of crisis: pursuing high-level policy changes to eliminate political barriers to care and fund harm reduction efforts; enabling and empowering harm reduction programs to innovatively and safely distribute vital resources and build community during a crisis; and providing comprehensive support to people to minimize drug-related harms.","Noyes, Elizabeth; Yeo, Ellis; Yerton, Megan; Plakas, Isabel; Keyes, Susan; Obando, Aura; Gaeta, Jessie M; Taveras, Elsie M; Chatterjee, Avik",Public health reports,https://doi.org/10.1177/0033354921999396; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33673755/,264

METHODS A multidisciplinary working group formulated recommendations based on the GRADE approach. RESULTS Seven of the recommendations were based on randomized controlled trials and three on professional consensus. The guideline recommends surgical decompression for symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis. Supervised exercise and postsurgical supervised exercise are recommended due to the general beneficial effects of training on general health, even though there was no evidence on an effect on neurogenic pain. The guideline does not recommend manual therapy, paracetamol, NSAIDs, opioids, neurogenic pain medication, muscle relaxants, and decompression combined with instrumented fusion as there was no evidence of the beneficial effect. CONCLUSION The recommendations are based on low to very low quality of evidence or professional consensus as well as patient preferences and positive or harmful effects of the intervention. The true treatment effect may therefore be different from the estimated effects, which is why the results should be interpreted with caution. The working group recommends intensified research in relation to all aspects of management of lumbar spinal stenosis.

Herein, the aqueous solubility and oral bioavailability of liquiritin was purposely enhanced via the preparation of the mixed micelles. Methods: The liquiritin-loaded micelles (LLM) were fabricated via thin-film dispersion method. The optimal LLM formulation was evaluated through physical properties including particle size (PS), encapsulation efficiency (EE) and drug loading (DL). In vitro accumulate release as well as in vivo pharmacokinetics were also evaluated. Moreover, the hypolipidemic activity of LLM was observed in the hyperlipidemia mice model. Results: The LLM exhibited a homogenous spherical shape with small mean PS, good stability and high encapsulation efficiency. The accumulate release rates in vitro of the LLM were obviously higher than free liquiritin. The oral bioavailability of the formulation was heightened by 3.98 times in comparison with the free liquiritin. More importantly, LLM increased the hypolipidemic and effect of alleviating lipid metabolism disorder in hepatocytes of liquiritin in hyperlipidemia mice model. Conclusions: Collectively, the improved solubility of liquiritin in water coupled with its enhanced oral bioavailability and concomitant hypolipidemic activity could be attributed to the incorporation of the drug into the mixed micelles.","Weng, Wen; Wang, Qilong; Wei, Chunmei; Adu-Frimpong, Michael; Toreniyazov, Elmurat; Ji, Hao; Yu, Jiangnan; Xu, Ximing",Drug development and industrial pharmacy,https://doi.org/10.1080/03639045.2021.1879839; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33494627/,264

MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty-four healthy, right-handed subjects filled their bladders by drinking water. The subjects were scanned under an empty bladder and a strong desire to void states. The Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated among 90 brain regions in the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas to construct the brain functional network. A paired t test (P < .05, after false discovery rate [FDR] correction) was used to detect significant differences in the FC, topologic properties (small-world parameters [gamma, sigma], Cp , Lp , Eglob , Eloc , and Enodal ) between the two states in all subjects. RESULTS Both the two states showed small-world network properties. The clustering coefficient (Cp ) and local efficiency (Eloc ) in the whole brain network decreased, while the FC within the default mode network (DMN) increased during the strong desire to void compared with the empty bladder state. Moreover, an increased nodal efficiency (Enodal ) was detected in the basal ganglia (BG), DMN, sensorimotor-related network (SMN), and visual network (VN). CONCLUSION We detected FC changes and topologic property alterations in brain functional networks caused by a strong desire to void in healthy and suggest that the micturition control may be a process dominated by DMN and coordinated by multiple sub-networks (such as, BG, SMN, and VN), which could serve as a baseline for understanding the pathologic process underlying bladder dysfunction and be useful to improve targeted therapy in the future.","Pang, Dongqing; Gao, Yi; Liao, Limin; Ying, Xiaoqian",Neurourology and urodynamics,https://doi.org/10.1002/nau.24445; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609930/,264
157848,Cancer Clinical Trials: What Every Radiologist Wants to Know but Is Afraid to Ask.,2021-02-17,"Caries progression seems to follow universal, predictable rates, depending largely on the caries severity in populations: the higher the caries severity, the higher the progression rates. Quantification of these rates would allow prediction of future caries increments. Our aim was to describe caries progression rates in the primary and permanent dentition in Western populations (not in lesions) of children and adolescents. Therefore, we systematically searched MEDLINE-PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane library for studies reporting caries progression data. Eligibility criteria were reporting empirical data from at least 2 full-mouth dental caries examinations in a closed cohort during a follow-up of at least 3 y, a first examination after 1974, a second examination before the age of 22 y, caries assessed as dentine caries (d3/D3), and caries reported in dmfs/DMFS (decayed, missing, and filled surfaces), dmft/DMFT (decayed, missing, and filled teeth), or caries-free participants. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement, we described the results for the primary and permanent dentition in a systematic review, performed a meta-analysis for the caries incidence rate in the permanent dentition, and conducted multivariate, hierarchical meta-regression analyses for the caries incidence rate and the increments in DMFS and DMFT. Of the 6,343 unique studies retrieved, 43 studies (56,376 participants) were included for systematic review and 32 for meta-analyses (39,429 participants). The annual decline in caries-free children in the permanent dentition ranged from 0.8% to 10.2%. The annual increment ranged from 0.07 to 1.77 in DMFS and from 0.06 to 0.73 in DMFT. The pooled caries incidence rate was 0.11 (0.09-0.13) per person-year at risk. Meta-regression analyses showed that the methods of individual studies influenced pooled caries incidence rates and increments in DMFS and DMFT. This should be taken into account in planning and evaluation of oral health care services. However, the caries incidence rate is promising for prediction of future caries increments in populations.","Hummel, R; Akveld, N A E; Bruers, J J M; van der Sanden, W J M; Su, N; van der Heijden, G J M G",Journal of dental research,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022034519847953; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31070943/,264
158255,Locoregional therapies in patients with recurrent intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma after curative resection.,2020,"Ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma (OCCA) is characterized by a particularly poor response to conventional chemotherapy and a short overall survival time in women with established disease. The development of targeted treatments for OCCA relies on a better understanding of its molecular characteristics. IL-6 is strongly expressed in OCCA and may therefore provide a novel therapeutic target. Here we use CRISPR/Cas9 and conditional short-hairpin interfering RNA to perform loss-of-function studies in human OCCA cell lines to explore the requirement for IL-6 in vitro and in vivo. While reduction of IL-6 expression exerted limited effects in vitro, its attenuation significantly impaired tumor growth and neovascularization in vivo. In contrast to typical signaling via STAT3, IL-6 in OCCA signaled via a non-canonical pathway involving gp130, Src, and the Hippo pathway protein YAP. A high-throughput combination drug screen identified agents that enhanced cell killing following reduction of IL-6 signaling. Intersection of screen hits obtained from two cell lines and orthogonal approaches to attenuation of IL-6 yielded AKT and EGFR inhibitors as enhancers of the inhibitory monoclonal IL-6 receptor antibody Tocilizumab. This study defines for the first time the requirements for, and mechanisms of, signaling by IL-6 in human OCCA cell lines and identifies potential combinatory therapeutic approaches. Given the molecular diversity of OCCA, further in vitro and in vivo studies are warranted to determine whether such approaches will overcome the limited efficacy of Tocilizumab observed in ovarian cancer to date.","Azar, Walid J; Christie, Elizabeth L; Mitchell, Chris; Liu, David S; Au-Yeung, George; Bowtell, David D L",Cancer research,https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.can-19-3044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917727/,264

The numerical analysis revealed that the thermal conductivity and diffusivity can be determined by the temperature response induced by the uniform heat flux in the heating elements. After calibrating the probe using a material (agar gel) of known thermal conductivity, the probe was deployed to calculate the thermal conductivity of Crisco. The measured value is in agreement with that determined by the macro-hot-wire probe method to within 3%. Finally, the micro thermal probe was used to investigate the change of thermal conductivity of pig liver before and after RF ablation treatment. The results show an increase in thermal conductivity of liver after the RF ablation.","Yi, Ming; Panchawagh, Hrishikesh V; Podhajsky, Ronald J; Mahajan, Roop L",IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,https://doi.org/10.1109/tbme.2009.2020991; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19403359/,264

However, there are few experimental proofs to directly show the neuroanatomical connection. Here, we examined the behavioral alterations by constructing an animal model with chemically induced unilateral labyrinthectomy (UL). In the experiment using rats (26 for UL, 14 for volume cavity, 355-498 g, male), the models were initially evaluated by the rota-rod (RR) test (21/26, 80.8%) and ocular displacement (23/26, 88.5%). The duration on the rolling rod decreased from 234.71 ± 64.25 s (4th trial before UL) to 11.81 ± 17.94 s (1st trial after UL). Also, the ocular skewed deviation (OSD) was observed in the model with left (5.79 ± 3.06°) and right lesion (3.74 ± 2.69°). Paw distance (PW) was separated as the front (FPW) and the hind side (HPW), and the relative changes of HPW (1.71 ± 1.20 cm) was larger than those of FPW (1.39 ± 1.06 cm), providing a statistical significance (p = 1.51 × 10-4, t test). Moreover, the results of the RR tests matched to those of the changing rates (18/21, 85.7%), and the changes (16/18, 88.9%) were dominantly observed in HPW (in FPW, 2/18, 11.1%). Current results indicated that the UL directly affected the changes in HPW more than those in FPW. In conclusion, the missing neural information from the peripheral vestibular system caused the abnormal posture in HPW, and the postural instability might reduce the performance during the voluntary movement shown in the RR test, identifying the relation between the walking imbalance and the unstable posture in PW.

For many life-threatening global infectious diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, malaria and influenza, effective vaccinations are still lacking. There are numerous roadblocks to developing new vaccines, including a limited understanding of immune correlates of protection to these global infections. To induce a reproducible, strong immune response against difficult pathogens, sophisticated nanovaccine technologies are under investigation. In contrast to conventional vaccines, nanovaccines provide improved access to lymph nodes, optimal packing and presentation of antigens, and induction of a persistent immune response. This Review provides a perspective on the global trends in emerging nanoscale vaccines for infectious diseases and describes the biological, experimental and logistical problems associated with their development, and how immunoengineering can be leveraged to overcome these challenges.","Singh, Ankur",Nature nanotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41565-020-00790-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33199883/,264

Methods: Three groups of children were enrolled into the prospective study during January 20 to February 20, 2020 from Capital Institute of Pediatrics, including children in the exposed group with ARI and epidemiological history associated with COVID-19 from whom both pharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected, children in the ARI group without COVID-19 associated epidemiological history and children in the screening group for hospital admission, with neither COVID-19 associated epidemiological history nor ARI. Only nasopharyngeal swabs were collected in the ARI group and screening group. Each group is expected to include at least 30 cases. All specimens were tested for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid by two diagnostic kits from different manufacturers. All nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for multiple respiratory pathogens, whilst the results from the ARI group were compared with that in the correspondence periods of 2019 and 2018 used by t or χ(2) test. Results: A total of 244 children were enrolled into three groups, including 139 males and 105 females, the age was (5±4) years. The test of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid were negative in all children, and high positive rates of pathogens were detected in exposed (69.4%, 25/36) and ARI (55.3%, 73/132) groups, with the highest positive rate for mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) (19.4%, 7/36 and 17.4%, 23/132, respectively), followed by human metapneumovirus (hMPV) (16.7%, 6/36 and 9.8%, 13/132, respectively). The positive rate (11.8%, 9/76) of pathogens in the screening group was low. In the same period of 2019, the positive rate of pathogens was 83.7% (77/92), with the highest rates for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A (29.3%, 27/92), followed by influenza virus (Flu) A (H1N1) (19.6%, 18/92) and adenovirus (ADV) (14.1%, 13/92), which showed significant difference with the positive rates of the three viruses in 2020 (RSV A: χ(2)=27.346, P<0.01; FluA (H1N1): χ(2)=28.083, P<0.01; ADV: χ(2)=7.848, P=0.005) . In 2018, the positive rate of pathogens was 61.0% (50/82), with the highest rate for human bocavirus (HBoV) (13.4%, 11/82) and followed by ADV (11.0%, 9/82), and significant difference was shown in the positive rate of HBoV with that in 2020 (χ(2)=6.776, P=0.009). Conclusions: The infection rate of 2019-nCoV is low among children in Beijing with no family clustering or no close contact, even with epidemiological history. The spectrum of pathogens of ARI in children during the research period is quite different from that in the previous years when the viral infections were dominant. MP is the highest positively detected one among the main pathogens during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Beijing where there is no main outbreak area.","Zhao, L Q; Deng, L; Cao, L; Chen, D M; Sun, Y; Zhu, R N; Wang, F; Guo, Q; Zhou, Y T; Jia, L P; Huang, H; Kang, X H; Jin, F H; Yuan, Y; Zhang, N; De, R; Qian, Y",Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112140-20200426-00437; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32842383/,264
161859,Epicardial left atrial appendage closure-comparison of surgical techniques in an ex vivo model.,2017,"BACKGROUND Woven EndoBridge (WEB) deployment remains challenging in aneurysms with a complex shape or orientation. OBJECTIVE To show that embolization of wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms using the WEB device balloon remodeling-assisted technique is a feasible and elegant endovascular solution compared with other techniques, such as balloon remodeling or stent-assisted coiling. MATERIALS AND METHODS 10 cases (10 aneurysms in 9 patients) of balloon remodeling-assisted WEB treatment of unruptured complex bifurcation aneurysms were treated in our institution and retrospectively analyzed. Details of clinical presentations, technical details, perioperative and postoperative complications, and outcomes were collected. Immediate and long-term angiographic results were also evaluated. RESULTS Aneurysms included six middle cerebral artery aneurysms, one anterior communicating artery aneurysm, one posterior communicating artery aneurysm, one basilar artery aneurysm, and one T-shaped carotid aneurysm. Mean dome width was 6.55 mm, mean neck size 4.5 mm, mean height 4.79 mm, and mean dome-to-neck ratio was 1:1.46. Treatment was performed exclusively with the balloon remodeling-assisted WEB technique in all cases. The device was successfully deployed in every case. Periprocedural thromboembolic or hemorrhagic events did not occur. The modified Rankin Scale score at discharge was 0 for all patients. At mid-term or long-term angiographic follow-up, adequate occlusion was observed in 7 aneurysms from 8 controlled cases (87.5%), and one patient (2 aneurysms) did not have angiographic follow-up. CONCLUSION The balloon remodeling-assisted WEB technique seems to be a safe and effective solution for endovascular treatment of unruptured wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms with specific complex anatomy. However, further studies are needed to evaluate the rate of complications and long-term efficacy.","Mihalea, Cristian; Escalard, Simon; Caroff, Jildaz; Ikka, Léon; Rouchaud, Aymeric; Da Ros, Valerio; Pagiola, Igor; Marenco de la Torre, Joaquin Jose; Yasuda, Thomas; Popa, Bogdan Valeriu; Ples, Horia; Benachour, Nidhal; Ozanne, Augustin; Moret, Jacques; Spelle, Laurent",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2018-014104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30291206/,264

In doing so, opportunities for physical activity were likely reduced, potentially causing detrimental effects to older adults. Therefore, the present study investigated the influence of the initial six weeks of lockdown on physical activity levels, perceived physical function and mood in older adults. A cross-sectional, mixed-methods, observational study was conducted using self-administered, fortnightly online surveys throughout the UK between 21st March-4 May 2020. A total of 117 participants (52 males [age: 76 ± 4 years] and 65 females [age: 76 ± 4 years]) completed all surveys. Despite lockdown restrictions, this group of older adults maintained their pre-lockdown physical activity levels, but also increased their self-reported sedentary time. Subsequently, perception of physical function was maintained across lockdown. With regards to mood; the only strong evidence for an increase in depression was for males (ps = 95.35%; >0.3 AU), although self-reported levels of depression were similar between sexes at week six. Given the link between sedentary behaviour and negative health outcomes in older adults, strategies to reduce sedentariness during the COVID-19 pandemic are required.","Richardson, Darren L; Duncan, Michael J; Clarke, Neil D; Myers, Tony D; Tallis, Jason",Journal of sports sciences,https://doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2020.1850984; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33241966/,264
162187,Convalescent plasma is ineffective for covid-19.,2020-10-22,"BACKGROUND The World Health Organisation previously recommended routine screening in school-aged children in countries with a high prevalence of rheumatic heart disease (RHD); however, it is unclear if screening-detected (latent) valve disease will inevitably evolve to a pathological lesion. Understanding the natural history of latent RHD is essential prior to recommendation of screening in endemic areas. Studies documenting the progression of latent RHD have had contrasting conclusions about the pathogenicity of latent valvular lesions. This review provides estimates of rates of progression of latent RHD. METHODS AND FINDINGS In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, Global Index Medicus, Africa Wide, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Global Health Database for studies published before April 30, 2019. Study data were extracted from all studies which reported follow-up data on progression of latent valve lesions. Studies with control cohorts were used to calculate comparative prevalence ratios. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42019119427. We identified 12 studies reporting follow-up data on latent RHD for 950 people in 9 countries. The estimated pooled prevalence rate for progression per year of latent RHD was 5%/year (95% CI 2-8). Eight studies reported on the progression of borderline latent RHD with an estimated pooled prevalence of 2%/year (95% CI 0-4). Three studies included control groups. There was a significant increase in the risk of progression of valvular disease in the latent group compared with controls (RR = 3.57 (95%CI = 1.65-7.70, P = 0.001). The overall risk of bias was low. Given most studies included penicillin administration we were unable to document the natural history of latent RHD. Furthermore, we were unable to perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of administering penicillin prophylaxis on progression of valve disease given prescription of penicillin was not standardised. CONCLUSION Latent RHD has a slow rate of progression but it is significantly higher compared to controls, with definite latent RHD having a higher rate of progression compared with borderline latent disease. There are a massive number of individuals at risk for RHD in the developing world as well as logistical challenges of screening and delivering penicillin prophylaxis. The low rate of progression from untargeted screening may be an important consideration in resource-constrained environments.","Gutman, Sarah J; Shemesh, Elad; Marwick, Thomas H; Taylor, Andrew J",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234196; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32497088/,264
162701,COVID-19 and Kidney Transplantation,2021,"In these challenging times of the pandemic, as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has taken over the planet, its complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have the potential to wipe out a large portion of our population. Whereas a serious lack of ventilators, vaccine being months away makes the condition even worse. That's why promising drug therapy is required. One of them was suggested in this article. It is the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) to which the COVID-19 virus binds and upon downregulation of which the pulmonary permeability increases and results in the filling of alveoli by proteinaceous fluids, which finally results in ARDS. ARDS can be assisted by angiotensinII type-1 receptor (AT-1R) blocker and ACE-2 upregulator. AT-1R blocker will prevent vasoconstriction, the proinflammatory effect seen otherwise upon its activation. ACE-2 upregulation will ensure less formation of angiotensin II, vasodilatory effects due to the formation of angiotensin (1-7), increased breakdown of bradykinin at lung level. Overall, decreased vasoconstriction of vessels supplying lungs and decreased vasodilation of lung tissues will ensure decreased pulmonary permeability and eventually relieve ARDS. It should also be considered that all components of the reninangiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) are located in the lung tissues. A drug with the least plasma protein binding is required to ensure its distribution across these lung tissues. Cotinine appears to be a promising candidate for COVID-19- induced ARDS. It acts across the board and acts as both an AT-1R blocker, ACE-2 upregulator. It also has a weak plasma protein binding that helps to spread through the lung tissues. In this review, we summarized that cotinine, along with COVID-19 virus replication blocker anti-virals, may prove to be a promising therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 induced ARDS.","Sharma, Tarun; Mehan, Sidharth",Infectious disorders drug targets,https://doi.org/10.2174/1871526520666201218153554; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33342421/,264
163982,Two aortic root pseudoaneurysms in infective endocarditis in a patient with bicuspid aortic valve,2021,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected oncology practice in a variety of ways. We sought to evaluate the impact on pediatric oncology parent and young adult (YA) patient experiences, concerns, and perceived stress. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional Internet-based survey of parents and YA patients in the pediatric oncology and survivorship clinics at Stanford between June-December 2020. Patients were recruited in person by clinic staff or through the electronic patient health portal. Surveys (available in English and Spanish) included the NIH Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) and investigator-developed questions evaluating clinical practice changes, concerns about health and cancer care, and pandemic-related challenges. Bivariate analyses evaluated associations between demographic, clinical, and pandemic-related factors and (a) concern about the pandemic affecting health and cancer care, and (b) perceived stress. Results: Among 81 participants (66 parents, mean age 41.6 ± SD 9.6;15 YAs, mean age 21.9 ± 8.4 years), 37% selfidentified as Hispanic/Latino, 36% non-Hispanic white, and 21% Asian. Twenty-eight percent were on treatment and 47% had completed treatment (79% &lt; 5 years prior). Thirty percent reported cancer-related appointment changes, largely rescheduling (75%) and/or switching to telehealth (42%). Nearly half (45%) of parents and 27% of YAs reported feeling 'very' or 'extremely' concerned about the pandemic affecting their child's/their health or cancer care. Race/ethnicity emerged as the only demographic feature that was significantly associated with high concern (p = 0.018), with 57% of Hispanic/Latino and only 21% of non-Hispanic white respondents reporting high levels of concern. Specific concerns included fear of severe infection, immunosuppression, and whether infection would change treatment and compromise effectiveness. Parents and YAs reported 'a lot' or 'a great deal' of challenges in their personal/family life (61%) and work/professional life (48%). Among these were having less support from friends/family (35%), reduced wages/work hours (31%), and job loss (20%) with 20% reporting ≥ 3 challenges. On the PSS-10, stress in the past month was high for parents (mean 30 ± 4) and YAs (mean 31 ± 5.1) on a scale of 0-40. Risk factors for higher stress included: male gender (p = 0.028), less support from family/friends (p = 0.002), and experiencing ≥ 3 pandemic-related challenges (p = 0.013). Conclusions: Our findings confirm the prevalent worry and stress that pediatric oncology patients and families are experiencing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Better communication about cancer care service changes may help to alleviate some concerns. Supportive care resources may also help patients and families cope with psychosocial stressors, particularly among at-risk groups.","Smith, S. M.; Kumar, D.; Benedict, C.; Heathcote, L.

164085,Preprint server use in kidney disease research: a rapid review,2020-03-23,"Abstract Aluminum alloys are significant in various applications, and the desire is strong to develop higher strength with balanced other properties out of high Zn and Mg contents in aluminum. However, high contents of Zn and Mg will make the matrix brittle and incompatible for mass manufacturing. As nanoparticles could effectively and dynamically control the brittle secondary phases, it opens a new route to design and manufacture high-Zn and high-Mg aluminum alloys. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of nanomanufacturing of Al-12Zn-3.7Mg-1Cu alloy system with the help from TiC nanoparticles for potential ultrahigh-strength light-weight alloys. By applying the “hot rolling-natural aging” and “solution treatment-natural aging” processing routes, Al-12Zn-3.7Mg-1Cu alloy with TiC nanoparticles can achieve higher microhardness via natural aging and better machinability when compared with the pure Al-12Zn-3.7Mg-1Cu alloy. Microstructure and thermodynamic studies reveal that the reasons for the peak hardness difference of Al-12Zn-3.7Mg-1Cu alloy and Al-12Zn-3.7Mg-1Cu/1.5 vol.% TiC nanocomposites are due to the free energy difference by solution treatment temperature and the strain energy sustained by the residual secondary phases. The enhanced mechanical properties in Al-12Zn-3.7Mg-1Cu alloy with TiC nanoparticles at the peak-microhardness state after “solution treatment-natural aging” processing route prove the feasibility of the abovementioned nano-treating manufacturing method.","Pan, Shuaihang; Yao, Gongcheng; Yuan, Jie; Sokoluk, Maximilian; Li, Xiaochun",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920315067; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920315067,264

Companies consider various types of remote work environments to contain the spread of the virus. Among them, a satellite office is a type of remote work environment where a number of employees are allocated to their nearest office. The benefits from satellite offices are twofold: The significant reduction of travel distance also reduces the amount of carbon emission and fuel consumption. In addition, dividing employees into smaller groups significantly reduces the potential risks of infection in the office. This paper addresses a satellite office allocation problem that considers social and environmental sustainability and infection control at work. In order to evaluate the effect of different satellite office allocation, quantitative measures are developed for the following three criteria: carbon emission, fuel consumption, and the probability of infection occurrence at work. Simulation experiments are conducted to investigate different scenarios of regional infection rate and modes of transportation. The results show that adopting satellite offices not only reduces carbon emission and fuel consumption, but also mitigates business disruption in the pandemic.","Kim, S.; Lee, Y.; Choi, B.",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13148008,264

Rekomendasi yang dapat diberikan adalah menerapkan percobaan penggunaan formulir safety briefing dalam pelaksanaan handover di salah satu ruangan dengan memperhatikan protokol kesehatan dan mengevaluasi keefektifan pelaksanaan handover di masa pandemi COVID-19 secara rutin.","Bardah, Dadan; Afriani, Tuti; Yatnikasari, Aat; id,",Jurnal Kepemimpinan Dan Manajemen Keperawatan,https://doi.org/10.32584/jkmk.v4i1.917,264
166055,Successful Conduct of an Acute Stroke Clinical Trial During COVID,2021,"Extended Reality (XR) technology - such as virtual and augmented reality - is now widely used in Human Computer Interaction (HCI), social science and psychology experimentation. However, these experiments are predominantly deployed in-lab with a co-present researcher. Remote experiments, without co-present researchers, have not flourished, despite the success of remote approaches for non-XR investigations. This paper summarises findings from a 30-item survey of 46 XR researchers to understand perceived limitations and benefits of remote XR experimentation. Our thematic analysis identifies concerns common with non-XR remote research, such as participant recruitment, as well as XR-specific issues, including safety and hardware variability. We identify potential positive affordances of XR technology, including leveraging data collection functionalities builtin to HMDs (e.g. hand, gaze tracking) and the portability and reproducibility of an experimental setting. We suggest that XR technology could be conceptualised as an interactive technology and a capable data-collection device suited for remote experimentation.","Ratcliffe, Jack; Soave, Francesco; Bryan-Kinns, Nick; Tokarchuk, Laurissa; Farkhatdinov, Ildar",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.08046v1.pdf,264

BACKGROUND: Multiple studies have looked into heart failure readmissions but there is no study to our knowledge specifically analyzing patients with right heart failure. METHODS: Patients with right heart failure diagnosis were identified using the 2017 Nationwide Readmission Database (NRD) and were evaluated for the rates, predictors, and costs of unplanned 30 days readmission. Weighted analysis was performed to obtain nationally representative data. RESULTS: We identified 7142 patients with right heart failure of whom 21% had an unplanned readmission within 30 days of the index discharge. Patients with history of Coronary artery bypass grafting (p=0.033; OR 2.359; 95% CI 1.071 to 5.197), Chronic kidney disease (p<0.001; OR 1.607; 95% CI 1.402 to 1.843), atrial fibrillation (p=0.014; OR 1.417; 95% CI 1.072 to 1.873) had high odds of unplanned 30 day readmissions while obesity (p<0.001; OR 0.686; 95% CI 0.594 to 0.792) had negative odds of such readmissions. CONCLUSIONS: Thirty-day unplanned readmissions remain a significant issue affecting over 1 in 5 patients with right heart failure. Early unplanned readmissions are associated with significant mortality and financial burden in these patients.","Amritphale, A.; Zaman, J.; Awan, S.; Amritphale, N.; Awan, M.; Chatterjee, S.; Omar, B.; Fonarow, G.

169200,Comparison of clinical manifestations and risk factors of death in two age groups less and more than 50 years in patients with covid-19,2021,"We study three different measures of quantum correlations -- entanglement spectrum, entanglement entropy, and logarithmic negativity -- for (1+1)-dimensional massive scalar field in flat spacetime. The entanglement spectrum for the discretized scalar field in the ground state indicates a cross-over in the zero-mode regime, which is further substantiated by an analytical treatment of both entanglement entropy and logarithmic negativity. The exact nature of this cross-over depends on the boundary conditions used -- the leading order term switches from a $\log$ to $\log-\log$ behavior for the Periodic and Neumann boundary conditions. In contrast, for Dirichlet, it is the parameters within the leading $\log-\log$ term that are switched. We show that this cross-over manifests as a change in the behavior of the leading order divergent term for entanglement entropy and logarithmic negativity close to the zero-mode limit. We thus show that the two regimes have fundamentally different information content. Furthermore, an analysis of the ground state fidelity shows us that the region between critical point $\Lambda=0$ and the crossover point is dominated by zero-mode effects, featuring an explicit dependence on the IR cutoff of the system. For the reduced state of a single oscillator, we show that this cross-over occurs in the region $Nam_f\sim \mathscr{O}(1)$.","Jain, Parul; Chandran, S.

An abrupt transition to online education, however, has posited unprecedented challenges for educators, who have been forced to adjust to remote learning with little to no time to prepare. Focusing on the case of an English language program in South Korea, this case study examines the challenges and strategies that were emerging in the crisis-prompted online language learning and teaching context. In particular, this case study focuses on investigating what types of strategies English as-a foreign language (EFL) instructors with little prior experience teaching online used to create a sustainable and authentic technology-mediated language learning environment, and how they motivated language learners to actively participate in sustainable language development and use. Findings provide educators and administrators who have little to no experience teaching online with practical suggestions and ideas to consider. They can use these concepts to adapt their lesson plans to online platforms and design and deliver high-quality lessons that ensure students feel connected to their learning process and have sustainable language learning experiences.","Choi, L.; Chung, S.",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13147664,264

Our results indicate that public health measures undertaken in China reduced R from 1.5 in January to 0.4 in mid-March 2020. They also suggest, however, the limitations of isolation, quarantine, and large-scale attempts to limit travel. While the world-wide reproduction number briefly dropped below 1 as China implemented extensive public health measures, the introduction of the virus to other nations swiftly led to an increasing world-wide average value of R. In Italy, the nation hardest-hit following China, social distancing measures brought the local value of R down from 3.71 to 2.51. Nonetheless, the value of R in Italy persisted at levels well above 1, allowing for ongoing transmission. By mid-March 2020, as COVID-19 spread in areas without extensive public health interventions in place, the world-wide value of R increased to a level similar to that of late January.","Mohler, George; Schoenberg, Frederic; Short, Martin B.; Sledge, Daniel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01714v1.pdf,264

This paper examines the ways an educational provider taps elements of its social capital such as closure and reputation, to establish enforceable trust from clients and their network to enroll in online learning;in addition, it explores the factors that clients consider in deciding to enroll their children in online distance learning. This study is informed by James Coleman's and Ronald Burt's conceptions of closure, trust, and reputation. It employs a case study approach, focusing on a Philippine Catholic parochial high school. Results show that closure is demonstrated through the school's dense social network with parents, students, and the community through the Catholic church. Closure and the school's intergenerational and social reputation facilitate the creation of trust, which increased senior high school enrolment, contrary to the pattern of private schools closing down due to insufficient enrolment. This study contributes to the literature in online distance education, by focusing on aspects of the social structure that function as resources for people and organizations to achieve their interests.","Arnado, J.

It has affected the health of millions of people and has also driven many changes in societies. This research aims to describe and define the importance of ""spirituality"" as a mediator in the COVID-19 Pandemic in Turkey while having a positive correlation with ""resilience"" and an inverse relationship with ""hopelessness."" The correlational research design was used and data were gathered through the technique of convenience sampling. Standardized sociological and psychological instruments were used to measure the variables. The participants were (N=546) from the general Turkish population (male and female) with the age range of 20-69. The outcomes revealed that resilience is positively correlated with spirituality (r=0.83, p&lt;0.01), while spirituality is negatively correlated with hopelessness (r=-0.81, p&lt;0.01). Resilience is also negatively correlated with hopelessness (r=-0.72, p&lt;0.01). This study concluded that spirituality has a substantial impact on resilient behavior and reduces hopelessness even globally. This study enhances the literature related to psychological and sociological research and promotes the role of spiritual coping strategies, especially in the state of uncertainty created by the current COVID-19 Pandemic.","Gulerce, H.; Maraj, H.",Journal of Economy Culture and Society,https://doi.org/10.26650/jecs2020-0075,264

174908,B-po03-184 Reduction in Urgent Healthcare Visits by Using a Mobile Electrocardiographic Device,2021,"Novel corona virus disease (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic that has spread across the globe. The virus primarily infects type-2 pneumocytes in alveoli and causes lung disease, with severity ranging from mild pneumonia to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The virus also invades gastrointestinal epithelial cells, hepatocytes, and biliary epithelial cells. Derangement of liver function tests is noted in about one third of patients and appears to correlate with more severe disease. There are multiple mechanisms by which the virus can cause liver injury;immune-mediated inflammation and direct viral cytotoxicity are believed to be the predominant mechanisms. Liver injury appears to be transient, usually recovering with resolution of illness. Limited available studies and experience from prior corona virus pandemics seem to suggest that immunosuppressed patients have similar outcomes compared to non-immunosuppressed patients. Age and comorbid conditions seem to influence outcome, irrespective of immune status. Additionally, patients with preexisting comorbid conditions are more prone to acquire infection and should strictly adhere to travel and social distancing advisories. Telemedicine should be utilized to provide uninterrupted care for patients with liver disease, and clinic or hospital visits should be advised only in sick patients with advanced liver disease. In conclusion, liver dysfunction is not uncommon in COVID-19, it generally improves with resolution of disease, and patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) need continued follow up, uninterrupted by the ongoing pandemic, preferably in virtual clinic settings.","Thandassery, B.

Previous studies have shown utility of PAI in diagnosing breast cancer, visualizing vascular change in aging, and planning flap reconstruction surgeries. In this study, we show that PAI can be used to non-invasively visualize microvascular injuries in smokers, and in a vasculitis patient. We used two prototype PAI systems, PAI-03, and PAI-04 in this study. These systems were equipped with hemisphere-detector arrays, and used lasers at wavelengths of 795 nm (PAI-03), 756 and 797nm (PAI-04). Healthy volunteers and a patient diagnosed with vasculitis were enrolled upon obtaining written informed consent. The whole hand of the volunteers was scanned. We noted there were unique circular structures that we coined ""minute signals"". There were higher number of minute signals in smokers than in non-smokers. Enhanced minute signals were noted in the patient with vasculitis. In this patient, minute signals were suggested to have lower oxygenated hemoglobin content, likely suggesting blood clots or hemorrhage. Our study shows PAI systems can visualize unappreciated abnormalities in fine vasculatures non-invasively. Use of PAI can extend to other clinical entities with suspected vascular involvement.","Ishida, Y.; Matsumoto, Y.; Asao, Y.; Yoshikawa, A.; Kataoka, M.; Yagi, T.; Kabashima, K.; Toi, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.02.20224204v1?rss=1,264
176362,Endovascular Management of Post COVID-19 Arterial Thrombosis,2021,"Forward genetic mapping of F2 crosses between closely related substrains of inbred rodents - referred to as a reduced complexity cross (RCC) - is a relatively new strategy for accelerating the pace of gene discovery for complex traits, such as drug addiction. RCCs to date were generated in mice, but rats are thought to be optimal for addiction genetic studies. Based on past literature, one inbred Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat substrain, SHR/NCrl, is predicted to exhibit a distinct behavioral profile as it relates to cocaine vulnerability traits relative to another substrain, SHR/NHsd. Direct substrain comparisons are a necessary first step before implementing an RCC. We evaluated a number of premorbid addiction vulnerability traits and cocaine self-administration behaviors using a longitudinal within-subjects design. Trait impulsivity and compulsivity were greater in SHR/NCrl than SHR/NHsd, as were reactivity to sucrose reward, sensitivity to acute psychostimulant effects of cocaine, and cocaine abuse liability studied under fixed-ratio and chained schedules of cocaine self-administration. Trait compulsivity correlated with the acute psychostimulant effects of cocaine, which in turn correlated with cocaine taking under the chained schedule. Trait compulsivity also was the best predictor of cocaine seeking responses. Heritability estimates indicated that 22%-40% of the variances for the above phenotypes can be explained by additive genetic factors, providing sufficient genetic variance to conduct genetic mapping in F2 crosses of SHR/NCrl and SHR/NHsd. These results provide compelling support for using an RCC approach in SHR substrains to uncover candidate genes and variants that are of relevance to cocaine use disorders. Highlights Closely related SHR substrains have distinct cocaine vulnerability traits Inhibitory control was poorer in SHR/NCrl than SHR/NHsd SHR/NCrl were more sucrose reactive and sensitive to acute cocaine than SHR/NHsd Cocaine abuse liability was greater in SHR/NCrl than SHR/NHsd SHR substrains can be used in an RCC to uncover cocaine vulnerability genes & variants","Kantak, Kathleen M.; Stots, Carissa; Mathieson, Elon; Bryant, Camron D.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.06.434216,264

We demonstrate that these emerging VOCs were associated with an increase in virulence, as measured by risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and death. Compared to non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 strains, and adjusting for comorbidity, age and sex of cases, and temporal trends, the elevation in risk associated with N501Y-positive variants was 74% (62-86%) for hospitalization; 138% (105-176%) for ICU admission; and 83% (57-114%) for death. Increases with delta variant were even larger: 105% (80-133%) for hospitalization; 241% (163-344%) for ICU admission; and 121% (57-211%) for death.

176581,"Impact of Covid-19 Pandemic on Hospitalizations and Outcomes of Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients, Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Program (pcnasp)",2021,"Stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD) has persisted since 2014 in the Southeast Florida Coral Reef Ecosystem Conservation Area (ECA) where it was first discovered. Most of the highly susceptible corals have perished, leaving Montastraea cavernosa as the most abundant reef-building species with high SCTLD prevalence. Disease interventions (DI) have been conducted throughout Florida’s Coral Reef to save the remaining corals and reduce the disease prevalence with varying degrees of success. The two main treatments were chlorinated (Chl) epoxy and an antibiotic paste. The antibiotic paste was highly effective in the Florida Keys, but its effectiveness in the Coral ECA was questionable. Therefore, we compared the effectiveness of the antibiotic paste and Chl epoxy treatments on M. cavernosa to optimize DI efforts on this species in the Coral ECA. Significant differences were found between the treatment materials and applications related to the proportion of quiesced lesions and corals where antibiotic paste (91.2% success) outperformed Chl epoxy (20% success). By day 351, 50.6% of the antibiotic paste disease-break tissue was fully healed compared to 2.2% of the total Chl epoxy-filled disease-break area. During the study, new lesions occurred on previously treated colonies, as well as colonies not previously treated and new lesion rates varied through time, indicating revisitation is necessary to eliminate disease. Most margin treatments failed within the first nine days, however, most disease-breaks failed before 44 days. Considering the high treatment success of the antibiotic paste and the conditional variation of new lesion rates, about one month is a good practical re-visitation time for retreating failures and any new lesions. DI using antibiotic paste is currently the most effective way to intervene the SCTLD epidemic, but this is only effective as a stopgap measure while the larger causative agents are identified and remediated. Conducting DI at a reef-scape scale is time consuming and requires extensive person-power and resources, making it very expensive. But this expense pales in comparison to the current cost to restore the diversity and live tissue saved with DI. This method comes with the risk of introducing antibiotics into reef environments, which may have unintended outcomes.","Walker, Brian K.; Turner, Nicholas R.; Noren, Hunter K.

Materials and methods. The study design: a population-based epidemiological prospective study. We analyzed operative information on NKI COVID-19 incidence and features of clinical course in pregnant women, women in labor and parturient women as well as maternal and perinatal outcomes for March 11 to December 25, 2020 which were provided by the FEFD and SFD chief obstetricians-gynecologists. Mathematical analysis included methods of descriptive statistics, analysis of contingency table, where the value of χ2, the achieved level of significance (p) was estimated. Results. In the FEFD and SFD, over the COVID-19 2020 epidemic, the SARS-CoV-2 virus was revealed in 8485 pregnant women, women in labor and postpartum women (5.9% of pregnant women subjected to regular medical check-up;1.71% of the sick entire population). The incidence rate in pregnant women was 3.0 times higher than in the entire population: 5933,2 vs 1960,8 per 100 thousand (p<0.001). Among SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, 27.4% (2324) were asymptomatic, 52.7% (4471) have mild, 16.6% (1388) - moderate, 2.5% (210) - severe 0,5% (39) - extremely severe clinical course. In the intensive care and anesthesiology departments, 3.57% of pregnant women and 2.24% of the entire population (p<0.001) have been treated. Rate of using invasive artificial lung ventilation in pregnant women was lower than in the population: 0.48% vs 1.05% (p<0.001). 27.97% (2373) of women with confirmed NKI COVID-19 completed pregnancy. 81,7% of mothers delivered on time, 18.3% - prematurely. Cesarean delivery was performed in 42,0% of women, operative vaginal delivery (vacuum extraction, obstetric forceps) was registered in 0.2% of cases. 12 (0.14%) mothers died. The maternal mortality rate was 505.69 per 100 thousand live births (0.51% of patients with COVID-19 who gave birth). Mortality rates and the proportion of deaths in the entire population were statistically significantly higher: 1948.93 per 100 thousand sick population and 1.95% (p<0.001), respectively. 37 (1.56%) cases of perinatal losses were registered, of which 31 (1.30%) - stillbirths, 6 (0.26%) - early neonatal mortality. The SARS-CoV-2 virus was revealed in 148 (6.2%) newborns with the observance of anti-epidemic measures and separation of the mother and child immediately after delivery. Conclusion. The rate of revealing SARS-CoV-2 virus in pregnant women, women in labor and parturient women in Siberia and the Far East was 3.0 times higher than in the entire population, while clinical course of infectious process was less severe (less need for invasive mechanical ventilation, lower mortality rate). In mothers with COVID-19, preterm birth rate was 3.0 times higher, caesarean delivery rate -1.4 times higher compared with the average population indicators.

To achieve this objective, 44 Iranian intermediate subjects were picked out among 67 students based on the findings of the Oxford Quick Placement Test (OQPT). The subjects were then randomly divided into two equal groups: experimental and control. After assigning the subjects to two groups, they were pretested by a vocabulary test. Then, the experimental group received vocabulary instruction using WeChat application, while the control group received a conventional vocabulary instruction. After the instruction, a vocabulary posttest was given to both groups to assess the effectiveness of the treatment. The gathered data were analyzed through independent samples t-test, one-way ANCOVA, and paired samples t-test. The outcomes attained in this research demonstrated that there was a significant difference between the posttests of both groups in favor of the experimental group. Eventually, the conclusions and the pedagogical implications of this study were explicated.","Namaziandost, Ehsan Hashemifardnia Arash Bilyalova Albina Anvarovna Fuster-Guillén Doris Palacios Garay Jessica Paola Le Thi Ngoc Diep Ismail Hazhari Sundeeva Ludmila A.; Hibana, Ludmila A.; Rivera-Lozada, Oriana",Education Research International,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/8825450,264

But several issues could at least delimitate a future use of e-health technology in psychiatry/psychotherapy: Patient with severe depression and suicidality seem not to be the right target group Same with other serious mental disorders First contact patients (depending among others on their personality characteristics), often have problems to open themselves at phone or video contacts In Germany (and probably other European countries?) a relative high percentage of psychiatrists/psychotherapists are reluctant or at least ambivalent against video based interventions A quite high percentage of psychiatrists/psychotherapists in Germany believe that a relevant proportion of their patients might not accept this very technical approach of doctor-patient-interaction. Currently in Germany, probably also in some other European countries, complain that some legal and billing issues are not fully solved. Some of these problems could decrease in the future and insofar it is difficult to make a valid prediction of the place of e-health technology in psychiatry/psychotherapy. Beside this one point seems of great importance to me: the current e-health success, driven by the Covid-19 Pandemia, should not be the direction of more cost saving psychiatry/psychotherapy, generally neglecting the need for personal interaction between patients and therapists.No significant relationships.","Möller, H.

In such a background, data from ground-based environmental stations, satellites, and reanalysis materials are utilized to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the global air quality changes during the COVID-19 outbreak. The results showed that under the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, a significant decrease in particulate matter (PM x ) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) occurred in more than 40% of the world’s land area, with NO2 (PM x ) decreasing by ∼30% (∼20%). The mobility, meteorological factors, and the response speed to COVID-19 outbreaks were examined. It was further found that in quick-response cities, lockdowns produced a sharp decline in mobility and had a dominant impact on air quality. In contrast, in slow-response cities, mobility dropped gradually since the confirmation of the first COVID-19 case (FCC) and he impact of the FCC, lockdowns, and meteorological factors were comparable.","Yang, Qianqian Wang Bin Wang Yuan Yuan Qiangqiang Jin Caiyi Wang Jiwen Li Shuwen Li Muyu Li Tongwen Liu Song Shen Huanfeng Zhang Liangpei",Environmental Research Letters,https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac1012,264

The focus of this study is on additive manufacturing (also known as 3D printing), which was the dominant manufacturing method employed in these production efforts. Production details from a variety of informal production efforts were systematically analyzed to quantify the scale and efficiency of different efforts. Data for this analysis was primarily drawn from detailed survey data from 74 individuals who participated in these different production efforts, as well as from a systematic review of 145 publicly available news stories. This rich dataset enables a comprehensive summary of the community-driven production efforts, with detailed and quantitative comparisons of different efforts. In this study, factors that influenced production efficiency and success were investigated, including choice of PPE designs, production logistics, and additive manufacturing processes employed by makerspaces and universities. From this investigation, several themes emerged including challenges associated with matching production rates to demand, production methods with vastly different production rates, inefficient production due to slow build times and high scrap rates, and difficulty obtaining necessary feedstocks. Despite these challenges, nearly every maker involved in these production efforts categorized their response as successful. Lessons learned and themes derived from this systematic study of these results are compiled and presented to help inform better practices for future community-driven use of additive manufacturing, especially in response to emergencies.","Budinoff, Hannah D.; Bushra, Jannatul Shafae Mohammed",Journal of Manufacturing Systems,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmsy.2021.07.010,264

The purpose of this study was to identify the key factors enabling the hospital to survive SARS unscathed. Data were collected from in-depth interviews with the nursing directors and nursing managers of the SARS units, along with a review of relevant hospital documents. The five key elements identified as survival factors during this SARS crisis are as follows: 1. good control of timing for crisis management, 2. careful decision-making, 3. thorough implementation, 4. effective communication, and 5. trust between management and employees.

We compared the quality of these IPMAs with the quality of a BHV4 indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In addition, a preliminary serological survey of BHV4 antibodies was carried out to estimate the seroprevalence of BHV4 in Dutch cattle at different ages. The specificities of both BHV4 IPMAs were 1.00. The geometrical mean titers (detection limit) of the BHV4 IPMAs were twice as high as that of the BHV4 indirect ELISA. In experimentally infected cattle, BHV4 antibodies were detectable by IPMAs 16 to 18 days postinfection, which was almost 2 weeks earlier than in the indirect ELISA. The reproducibility of the BHV4 DN-599 IPMA (kappaD value, 0.92) and of the BHV4 LVR 140 IPMA (kappaD value, 0.87) were good. For field sera the overall agreement between the BHV4 indirect ELISA and the two BHV4 IPMAs, DN-599 and LVR 140, was 95 and 96%, respectively. The serological-survey study showed that the estimated seroprevalence of BHV4 in Dutch cattle was 16 to 18% and that the percentage of BHV4-positive animals varied by age category (between 6 and 43%). In summary, the two BHV4 IPMA formats have several advantages that make IPMA a useful alternative to the BHV4 indirect ELISA for detecting BHV4 antibodies in cattle.","Wellenberg, G J; van Rooij, E M; Maissan, J; Van Oirschot, J T",Clinical and diagnostic laboratory immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10391841/,264

Recovery can occur without apparent neurological damage. To better define the factors facilitating noncytolytic clearance of SINV in different regions of the central nervous system (CNS) and the roles of innate and adaptive immune responses at different times during infection, we have characterized SINV infection and clearance in the brain, brain stem, and spinal cords of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and C57BL/6 (wild-type [WT]) mice and mice deficient in beta interferon (IFN-beta) (BKO), antibody (muMT), IFN-gamma (GKO), IFN-gamma receptor (GRKO), and both antibody and IFN-gamma (muMT/GKO). WT mice cleared infectious virus by day 8, while SCID mice had persistent virus replication at all sites. For 3 days after infection, BKO mice had higher titers at all sites than WT mice, despite similar IFN-alpha production, but cleared virus similarly. GKO and GRKO mice cleared infectious virus from all sites by days 8 to 10 and, like WT mice, displayed transient reactivation at 12 to 22 days. muMT mice did not clear virus from the brain, and clearance from the brain stem and lumbar spinal cord was delayed, followed by reactivation. Eighty-one days after infection, muMT/GKO mice had not cleared virus from any site, but titers were lower than for SCID mice. These studies show that IFN-beta is independently important for early control of CNS virus replication, that antiviral antibody is critical for clearance from the brain, and that both antibody and IFN-gamma contribute to prevention of reactivation after initial clearance.","Burdeinick-Kerr, Rebeca; Wind, Jennifer; Griffin, Diane E",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17376910/,264
193206,The fetal origins of adult disease.,2001,"The first membrane-spanning domain (m1) of the model cis Golgi protein M (formerly called E1) from the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus is required for targeting to the Golgi complex. When inserted in place of the membrane-spanning domain of a plasma membrane protein (vesicular stomatitis virus G protein), the chimeric protein (""Gm1"") is retained in the Golgi complex of transfected cells. To determine the precise features of the m1 domain responsible for Golgi targeting, we produced single amino acid substitutions in m1 and analyzed their effects on localization of Gm1. Expression at the plasma membrane was used as the criterion for loss of Golgi retention. Rates of oligosaccharide processing were used as a measure of rate and efficiency of transport through the Golgi complex. We identified four uncharged polar residues that are critical for Golgi retention of Gm1 (Asn465, Thr469, Thr476, and Gln480). These residues line one face of a predicted alpha-helix. Interestingly, when the m1 domain of the homologous M protein from mouse hepatitis virus is inserted into the G protein reporter, the chimeric protein is not efficiently retained in the Golgi complex, but transported to the cell surface. Although it possesses three of the four residues we identified as important in the avian m1 sequence, other residues in the membrane-spanning domain from the mouse protein must prevent efficient recognition of the polar face within the lipid bilayer of the cis Golgi.","Machamer, C E; Grim, M G; Esquela, A; Chung, S W; Rolls, M; Ryan, K; Swift, A M",Molecular biology of the cell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8400455/,264

We describe here a mathematical model of HCV replication that assumes that the translation of the HCV polyprotein occurs in the cytoplasm, that HCV RNA synthesis occurs in vesicular-membrane structures, and that the strategy of replication involves a double-stranded RNA intermediate. Our results shed light on the intracellular dynamics of subgenomic HCV RNA replication from transfection to steady state within Huh-7 cells. We predict the following: (i) about 6 x 10(3) ribosomes are involved in generating millions of HCV NS5B-polymerase molecules in a Huh-7 cell, (ii) the observed 10:1 asymmetry of plus- to minus-strand RNA levels can be explained by a higher-affinity (200-fold) interaction of HCV NS5B polymerase-containing replication complexes with HCV minus-strand RNA over HCV plus-strand RNA in order to initiate synthesis, (iii) the latter higher affinity can also account for the observed approximately 6:1 plus-strand/minus-strand ratio in vesicular-membrane structures, and (iv) the introduction of higher numbers of HCV plus-strand RNA by transfection leads to faster attainment of steady-state but does not change the steady-state HCV RNA level. Fully permissive HCV replication systems have been developed, and the model presented here is a first step toward building a comprehensive model for complete HCV replication. Moreover, the model can serve as an important tool in understanding HCV replication mechanisms and should prove useful in designing and evaluating new antivirals against HCV.","Dahari, Harel; Ribeiro, Ruy M; Rice, Charles M; Perelson, Alan S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17035310/,264

Clinical findings show that the patients with either symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19 can be a potential source of infection. Although respiratory droplets and close contact are considered to be the main routes of transmission, there is the possibility of aerosol transmission in a relatively closed environment. The nucleic acid of the novel coronavirus can be detected in nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum and other lower respiratory tract secretions, blood, feces, urine and so on, but whether it exists in the semen has not been confirmed. It is reported that the novel coronavirus may affect the testis that highly expresses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and theoretically the semen is a possible carrier of the virus considering the fact that it is discharged from the same channel as the urine. Andrology laboratorians are exposed to most of the specimens above, including semen, and some open operations in the laboratory increase the risk of aerosol generation. Therefore, corresponding protective procedures are necessitated in andrology laboratories to reduce the risk of infection during the outbreak of COVID-19.

The antibodies, 93B, 74D(B) and 38F, recognized the major envelope glycoprotein (GL) encoded by open reading frame (ORF) 5 in immunoblots and by immunoprecipitation. All three MAbs were used to compare the Bucyrus isolate of EAV and MAb neutralization-resistant (NR) escape mutants with the vaccine virus and 19 independent field isolates of EAV by virus neutralization. The different abilities of the MAbs to neutralize virus isolates indicated that they recognize non-identical epitopes. Susceptibility to virus neutralization could not be used to distinguish viruses from acutely and persistently infected horses. Comparison of the ORF 5 nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence from NR and neutralization-sensitive virus isolates revealed amino acid sequence changes at positions 99 and 100 which correlate with the NR phenotype. Additional unique changes in the amino acid sequence of MAb NR viruses at positions 96 and 113 may also contribute to neutralization resistance. The sequence data further showed that the Bucyrus-derived viruses contain one N-glycosylation site, whereas the field isolates DL8 and DL11 possess two sites, both of which are used. Most of the non-conservative amino acid sequence changes were located within the second half of the N-terminal hydrophilic domain. Sequence changes within the first half of the N-terminal ectodomain, the predicted transmembrane domain and the C-terminal hydrophilic domain were mainly silent base substitutions or resulted in conservative amino acid substitutions, suggesting that these regions of the protein are functionally conserved.","Glaser, A L; de Vries, A A; Dubovi, E J",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7561759/,264

RT-PCR assay became positive for the second time in 45 (32.8%). Anti-COVID-19 IgM and IgG antibodies were positive in 83 (60.6%) and 86 (62.8%) patients, respectively. Finally, it was determined that serological test was diagnostic in 73% of patients and the diagnostic yield of serology was significantly higher after the first week of illness (54.8% in the first week and 88% after that). Taking advantage of both serological tests and RT-PCR helps in diagnosing 83.9% of cases. Based on the present study, the serology may be useful as a complementary test and in parallel to RT-PCR assay for diagnosis of COVID-19 among admitted symptomatic cases.","Rezaei, Mitra; Baghaei, Parvaneh; Sadr, Makan; Moniri, Afshin; Babamahmoodi, Abdolreza; Qadimi, Somayeh; Porabdollah, Mihan; Nadji, Seyed Alireza; Tabarsi, Payam; Marjani, Majid","Iranian journal of allergy, asthma, and immunology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34418893/,264
200264,A negative fallout of COVID-19 lockdown in Italy: Life-threatening delay in the diagnosis of celiac disease,2020,"The processes used by academic and industrial scientists to discover new drugs have recently experienced a true renaissance with many new and exciting techniques. The number of protein structures and/or chemical ligands is constantly growing, through the use of parallel chemistry, X-ray crystallography, NMR or homology modeling methods and so is the theoretical understanding of protein-ligand interactions. As such, structure-based approaches to drug-design and in silico screening are becoming routine part of most modern lead discovery programs. Prioritization of compound libraries is an extremely important task that aims at the rapid identification of tight-binding ligands and ultimately new therapeutic compounds. These in silico approaches combined with other experimental methods facilitate the design of new medicines to treat cardiovascular, degenerative, infectious, and neoplastic diseases, among others. Here, we review key concepts and specific features of several selected ligand-receptor docking/scoring methods while several other topics pertaining to the field of in silico screening are reviewed in the following articles of this special issue of Current Protein and Peptide Science.","Sperandio, Olivier; Miteva, Maria A; Delfaud, Francois; Villoutreix, Bruno O",Current protein & peptide science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17073691/,264

200860,COVID-19 outcome in an isolated intestinal transplant recipient,2021,"Chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) is a general term for chronic, irreversible lung disease that combines qualities of emphysema and chronic bronchitis. The standard definition of chronic bronchitis is a productive cough for three months per year (for at least two consecutive years) without an underlying aetiology. Acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB) represents a common complaint that leads patients to seek medical attention. COPD and AECB are directly responsible for the overuse of antibiotics in the developed world. Fifty per cent of exacerbations have either viral or non-infectious origin. For this reason, antibiotic use remains controversial. Among other bacteria, Chlamydia pneumoniae is responsible for 4 - 16% of AECB in hospitalised or out-patients, although among smokers and people using steroids, the incidence is 34%. C. pneumoniae may either be the sole causative agent or a co-agent in AECB. This paper reviews the management of COPD/AECB with respect to antibiotic use. Diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy relevant to Chlamydia in the management of AECB are also evaluated in this review.","Karnak, Demet; Beder, Sumru",Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12387692/,264

In this 12-month observational study conducted in Asia (Hong Kong, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan), 984 postmenopausal women (aged 55 years or older) were treated with raloxifene 60 mg/day (n = 707; 72%) or daily bisphosphonate (alendronate 10 mg/day; n = 206; 21%, or risedronate 5 mg/day; n = 71; 7%) during their normal course of care. Patients were assessed at baseline, 6, and 12 months. Baseline characteristics (including age, race, education, menopausal status, and baseline fractures) were comparable between the raloxifene and bisphosphonate groups. More women on raloxifene completed the study compared with those on bisphosphonate (50.2% versus 37.5%; P < 0.001). Patients also took raloxifene for a longer period than bisphosphonate (median, 356 versus 348 days; P = 0.011). Compared with those taking bisphosphonate, significantly fewer patients taking raloxifene discontinued the study because of stopping treatment (5.7% versus 10.1%, P = 0.017) or changing treatment (2.8% versus 9.7%, P < 0.001). Inconvenient dosing was reported as a primary reason for discontinuation due to stopping or changing treatment in 19 (6.9%) bisphosphonate patients compared with 0 raloxifene patients. The percentage of patients who had consumed 80% or more of their study medication was similar for raloxifene patients (48-56 weeks; 95.2%) and bisphosphonate patients (48-56 weeks; 93.3%). More raloxifene patients responded that they were satisfied with their medication than bisphosphonate patients at 48-56 weeks (P = 0.002). We concluded that Asian postmenopausal women at increased risk of osteoporotic fractures showed a greater propensity to remain on raloxifene compared with bisphosphonate.

Here we have shown that, like its orthomyxovirus and rhabdovirus counterparts, it has RNA-binding capacity, as determined by retardation of (32)P-labelled riboprobes in gel electrophoresis, cross-linking with UV light and Northern-Western assays. Its binding to RNA was neither sequence-specific nor showed a length requirement, although it had cooperative kinetics with a K(d) of 25 nM and probably two different types of RNA-binding sites. After preparative cross-linking of (32)P-labelled riboprobes with purified, renatured HRSV Long strain M protein (256 residues), the residues in contact with RNA were located between amino acids 120 and 170, in the central part of the molecule. Lysine (positions 121, 130, 156 and 157) and arginine (position 170) residues located within this region and conserved among pneumovirus M proteins of different origins were found to be essential for RNA contact. M protein expression did not affect the replication and transcription of HRSV RNA analogues in vivo (except when expressed in large amounts), in contrast to the in vitro transcription inhibition described previously. In addition, M protein was found to aggregate into high-molecular-mass oligomers, both in the presence and absence of its RNA-binding activity. The formation of these structures has been related in other viruses to either viral or host-cell RNA metabolism.","Rodríguez, Lorena; Cuesta, Isabel; Asenjo, Ana; Villanueva, Nieves",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14993657/,264

Data were collected after the enactment of the first emergency regulations (between March 15 and April 1, 2020) via the Qualtrics Survey Software link that was sent out through social media platforms. In total, 205 participants aged 65 to 92 (mean age, 72.32; SD, 5.63) reported general anxiety symptom levels (GAD-7) (Spitzer et al., 2006), resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale), frequency of receptive arts engagement in the previous year, health status, exposure to risk situations, and behavioral changes due to the pandemic. Our hypothesis that receptive arts would moderate the resilience-COVID-19 anxiety link was examined by a multiple hierarchical regression analysis and with the PROCESS computational tool. Findings show that resilience was associated with COVID-19 anxiety and that this association was moderated by levels of receptive arts engagement. The findings show that high levels of prior art engagement constituted a potent buffer against subsequent COVID-19 anxiety. Policy makers may benefit older adults by encouraging their engagement in arts activities, even during social distancing.","Keisari, Shoshi; Hoffman, Yaakov; Ring, Lia; Palgi, Yuval",J Nerv Ment Dis,,264

This study reviewed this data to examine trends in FNA case numbers during fellowship training. METHODS: A retrospective review of the ACGME Accreditation Data System (ADS) FNA Case Log data was performed for academic years 2006-2019. For 2006-2016, total and average numbers of FNAs performed per academic year were available. After 2016, data also included the number of programs and trainees, national averages, standard deviation, minimum, median, maximum, and percentiles for the number of FNAs performed. RESULTS: The number of FNAs documented by cytopathology fellows has gradually increased from 2006 (average 10.9) to 2013 (average 18.6) and dramatically increased in 2014 (average 38.0). Averages have remained greater than 30 FNAs documented per academic year since 2014, with some variation. However, a decline was observed in 2019, likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: FNA procedures reported in the ACGME Case Log System indicate vast differences in cytopathology fellowship educational experiences and settings. After logging FNAs becoming an ACGME requirement in 2013, the average number of FNAs has been greater than 30 per year and provides some guidance for programs with respect to the number of FNAs being reported by cytopathology fellows nationally.","Salomao, Diva; Wu, Roseann I; Hatlak, Kate; Khanafshar, Elham; Monaco, Sara E",,,264

Results from a single Institution experience,2020,"Purpose of Review: In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, several academic studies have emerged that explore the importance of vitamin D in the development of the SARS-CoV2 infection. The basis of this interest comes from the established effect vitamin D status has on other acute respiratory infections, such as influenza. This article aims to determine the role and effect of vitamin D serum concentration in the prevalence and severity of COVID-19. Recent Findings: Several observational studies have demonstrated that suboptimal levels of vitamin D serum concentrations can significantly increase the risk of developing COVID-19 and lead to a more severe symptomatology. One study suggests, however, that supplementation of vitamin D could potentially increase the incidence of mortality in COVID-19 patients. Summary: Vitamin D status could have an influential role in the development and progression of SARS-CoV2 infection. Further studies are warranted to understand fully the veracity and the extent of this association.","Paiz, Nicole; Alonso, Paula; Portillo, Ana Luisa",Curr Trop Med Rep,,264

Comparing to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV seems to have a slightly wider range in choosing its receptor. We further resolved the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the cat ACE2 (cACE2) in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD at a resolution of 3 Å, revealing similar binding mode as hACE2 to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD.

Despite the fact that SARS-CoV-2 has slower evolutionary rate than other coronaviruses, different mutational hotspots have been identified along the SARS-CoV-2 genome. METHODS: We performed whole-genome high throughput sequencing on isolates from 50 Egyptian patients to see if the variation in clinical symptoms was related to mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Then, we investigated the relationship between the observed mutations and the clinical characteristics of the patients. RESULTS: Among the 36 most common mutations, we found two frameshift deletions linked to an increased risk of shortness of breath, a V6 deletion in the spike glycoprotein's signal peptide region linked to an increased risk of fever, longer fever duration and nasal congestion, and L3606-nsp6 deletion linked to a higher prevalence of cough and conjunctival congestion. S5398L nsp13-helicase was linked to an increased risk of fever duration and progression. The most common mutations (241, 3037, 14,408, and 23,403) were not linked to clinical variability. However, the E3909G-nsp7 variant was more common in children (2-13 years old) and was associated with a shorter duration of symptoms. The duration of fever was significantly reduced with E1363D-nsp3 and E3073A-nsp4. CONCLUSIONS: The most common mutations, D614G/spike-glycoprotein and P4715L/RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase, were linked to transmissibility regardless of symptom variability. E3909G-nsp7 could explain why children recover so quickly. Nsp6-L3606fs, spike-glycoprotein-V6fs, and nsp13-S5398L variants may be linked to clinical symptom worsening. These variations related to host-virus interactions might open new therapeutic avenues for symptom relief and disease containment.","Zekri, Abdel-Rahman N; Mohanad, Marwa; Hafez, Mohammed M; Soliman, Hany K; Hassan, Zainab K; Abouelhoda, Mohamed; Amer, Khaled E; Seadawy, Mohamed G; Ahmed, Ola S",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Basis Dis,,264

Desde então foram feitos muitos avanços na compreensão da raiva nestes animais. Atualmente, o vírus da raiva (RABV) já foi detectado em 37 espécies de morcegos brasileiros, tendo sido determinadas quatro linhagens genéticas específicas associadas a quatros gênero/espécies destes morcegos, três destas exclusivas de morcegos insetívoros. Entretanto, apesar da importância da raiva em morcegos insetívoros, estudos voltados a um conhecimento mais amplo das implicações da diversidade de amostras de RABV detectadas nos mesmos aplicados à Epidemiologia Molecular são escassos. Assim, a presente investigação teve por objetivos estabelecer genealogias para amostras de RABV isoladas de diversas espécies de morcegos insetívoros do Estado de São Paulo a partir de seqüências parciais dos genes N (40 amostras) e G (45 amostras), avaliar a existência de linhagens gênero-específicas do RABV e determinar os marcadores moleculares para sua diferenciação. Foram encontradas linhagens específicas de RABV para os gêneros Myotis, Epitesicus e Nyctinomops e três prováveis linhagens circulantes nos gêneros Tadarida, Histiotus e Lasiurus. Além disso, esta pesquisa revelou marcadores moleculares de aminoácidos específicos para os gêneros Myotis, Eptesicus e Nyctinomops, contribuindo para um melhor entendimento da epidemiologia molecular da Raiva e da relação entre o RABV e gêneros diversos de quirópteros","Oliveira, Rafael de Novaes",,,264

OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of RTIs and non-infectious ILD with these drugs. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Risk of RTIs and non-infectious ILD was compared to placebo by Mantel-Haenszel (MH) risk difference (RD). We divided RTIs into upper RTIs (URTI), viral URTIs, and lower RTIs (LRTIs) including infectious pneumonia. Non-infectious ILD included ILD, eosinophilic pneumonia, and pneumonitis. RESULTS: We identified 54 RCTs including 10,907 patients with six IL-12/23 or IL-23 antagonists and 5,175 patients with placebo. These drugs significantly increased the risk of RTIs (MH RD 0.019, 95% confidence interval 0.005-0.033, P = 0.007) which was attributed to URTIs, but not viral URTIs or LRTIs. There was no significant difference in infectious pneumonia and non-infectious ILD between two groups. LIMITATIONS: Due to the rarity of infectious pneumonia and ILD, sensitivity analysis was required. CONCLUSION: The use of IL-12/23 or IL-23 antagonists for autoimmune diseases increased the risk of URTIs, but not viral URTIs, LRTIs, and non-infectious ILD.","Akiyama, Shintaro; Yamada, Akihiro; Micic, Dejan; Sakuraba, Atsushi",J.

In this paper, SARS-Cov-2 RNA sequence analysis relative to region or territory is investigated. A uniform framework of sequence SVM model with various genetics length from short to long and mixed-bases is developed by projecting SARS-Cov-2 RNA sequence to different dimensional space, then scoring it according to the output probability of pre-trained SVM models to explore the territory or origin information of SARS-Cov-2. Different sample size ratio of training set and test set is also discussed in the data analysis. Two SARS-Cov-2 RNA classification tasks are constructed based on GISAID database, one is for mainland, Hongkong and Taiwan of China, and the other is a 6-class classification task (Africa, Asia, Europe, North American, South American\&Central American, Ocean) of 7 continents. For 3-class classification of China, the Top-1 accuracy rate can reach 82.45\% (train 60\%, test=40\%); For 2-class classification of China, the Top-1 accuracy rate can reach 97.35\% (train 80\%, test 20\%); For 6-class classification task of world, when the ratio of training set and test set is 20\% : 80\% , the Top-1 accuracy rate can achieve 30.30\%.

METHODS: A survey was conducted over the course of 5 days (from April 21 to 25, 2020), targeting all adult ID specialists currently in the medical field in South Korea (n = 265). An online-based survey was forwarded via text message and e-mail. Only one response was accepted from each participant. RESULTS: Of these 265 ID specialists gotten to, 132 (49.8%) responded. The highest proportion of the respondents envisaged the current COVID-19 outbreak to end after December 2020 (47.7% for the domestic Korean outbreak and 70.5% for the global pandemic); moreover, 60.7% of them stated that a second nationwide wave is likely to occur between September and December 2020 in South Korea. N95 respirators were considered to be the most important item in hospitals in preparation for a second wave. The most important policy to be implemented at the national level was securing national hospitals designated for the treatment of ID (67.4%). CONCLUSION: ID experts in South Korea believe that the COVID-19 pandemic may not be easily controlled and that a second nationwide wave is likely to occur in South Korea. Our results indicate that Korean ID specialists believe that a high level of preparation is needed in various aspects, including the procurement of personal protective equipment, to respond efficiently to a second outbreak.","Kim, Bongyoung; Park, Se Yoon; Jung, Dong Sik; Jung, Sook In; Oh, Won Sup; Kim, Shin-Woo; Peck, Kyong Ran; Chang, Hyun-Ha",Korean J Intern Med,,264

213676,PPE decontamination to overcome PPE shortage in rural area during pandemic,2021,"The importance of exertional hypoxia without resting hypoxia in COVID-19 is unknown and may help objectively identify high-risk patients. Interventions may be initiated earlier with sufficient lead-time between development of exertional hypoxia and other outcome measures. We performed a retrospective study of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from March 1, 2020 to October 30, 2020 in an integrated academic medical system in the Chicagoland area. We analyzed patients who had daily exertional oximetry measurements taken. We defined exertional hypoxia as SpO2 < 90% with ambulation. We excluded patients who had first exertional oximetry measurements or first exertional hypoxia after the use of oxygen therapies. We determined the association of exertional hypoxia without resting hypoxia with the eventual need for nasal cannula or advanced oxygen therapies (defined as high flow nasal cannula, Bi-PAP, ventilator, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). We also calculated the time between development of exertional hypoxia and the need for oxygen therapies. Of 531 patients included, 132 (24.9%) had exertional hypoxia. Presence of exertional hypoxia was strongly associated with eventual use of nasal cannula (OR 4.8, 95% CI 2.8-8.4) and advanced oxygen therapy (IRR 7.7, 95% CI 3.4-17.5). Exertional hypoxia preceded nasal cannula use by a median 12.5 h [IQR 3.25, 29.25] and advanced oxygenation by 54 h [IQR 25, 82]. Exertional hypoxia without resting hypoxia may serve as an early, non-invasive physiologic marker for the likelihood of developing moderate to severe COVID-19. It may help clinicians triage patients and initiate earlier interventions.","Bhasin, Ajay; Bregger, Melissa; Kluk, Mark; Park, Peter; Feinglass, Joe; Barsuk, Jeffrey",Intern. emerg. med,,264
213687,The challenges of measuring blood pressure during COVID-19: How to integrate and support home blood pressure measurements,2021,"The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia to acute respiratory distress syndrome is linked to a virus-induced ""cytokine storm"", associated with systemic inflammation, coagulopathies, endothelial damage, thrombo-inflammation, immune system deregulation and disruption of angiotensin converting enzyme signaling pathways. To date, the most promising therapeutic approaches in COVID-19 pandemic are linked to the development of vaccines. However, the fight against COVID-19 pandemic in the short and mid-term cannot only rely on vaccines strategies, in particular given the growing proportion of more contagious and more lethal variants among exposed population (the English, South African and Brazilian variants). As long as collective immunity is still not acquired, some patients will have severe forms of the disease. Therapeutic perspectives also rely on the implementation of strategies for the prevention of secondary complications resulting from vascular endothelial damage and from immune system deregulation, which contributes to acute respiratory distress and potentially to long term irreversible tissue damage. While the anti-inflammatory effects of low dose irradiation have been exploited for a long time in the clinics, few recent physiopathological and experimental data suggested the possibility to modulate the inflammatory storm related to COVID-19 pulmonary infection by exposing patients to ionizing radiation at very low doses. Despite level of evidence is only preliminary, these preclinical findings open therapeutic perspectives and are discussed in this article.","Francois, S.; Helissey, C.; Cavallero, S.; Drouet, M.; Libert, N.; Cosset, J.

220168,"Reply to COVID-19 encephalopathy, Bayes rule, and a plea for case-control studies",2021,"We introduce a compact pangenome representation based on an optimal segmentation concept that aims to reconstruct founder sequences from a multiple sequence alignment (MSA). Such founder sequences have the feature that each row of the MSA is a recombination of the founders. Several linear time dynamic programming algorithms have been previously devised to optimize segmentations that induce founder blocks that then can be concatenated into a set of founder sequences. All possible concatenation orders can be expressed as a founder block graph. We observe a key property of such graphs: if the node labels (founder segments) do not repeat in the paths of the graph, such graphs can be indexed for efficient string matching. We call such graphs segment repeat-free founder block graphs. We give a linear time algorithm to construct a segment repeat-free founder block graph given an MSA. The algorithm combines techniques from the founder segmentation algorithms (Cazaux et al. SPIRE 2019) and fully-functional bidirectional Burrows-Wheeler index (Belazzougui and Cunial, CPM 2019). We derive a succinct index structure to support queries of arbitrary length in the paths of the graph. Experiments on an MSA of SAR-CoV-2 strains are reported. An MSA of size $410\times 29811$ is compacted in one minute into a segment repeat-free founder block graph of 3900 nodes and 4440 edges. The maximum length and total length of node labels is 12 and 34968, respectively. The index on the graph takes only $3\%$ of the size of the MSA.","Makinen, Veli; Cazaux, Bastien; Equi, Massimo; Norri, Tuukka; Tomescu, Alexandru I.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09342v1.pdf,264

The Lassa fever model was established in the STAT1 KO mice mimicking phenotypes seen in human patients including deafness in survivors. This model develops hearing loss at high prevalence and is a valuable tool to investigate viral infection-induced hearing loss. However, Lassa virus is a highly contagious and regulated agent requiring the unique logistics of the biosafety level 4 posing limitations for experimental work. Therefore, we did a detailed auditory analysis of the STAT1 KO mice to assess baseline auditory function in preparation for further auditory behavioral studies. Auditory brainstem response and distortion product otoacoustic emission tests were performed on males and females of the STAT1 KO mice and was compared to 129S6/SvEv wild type (WT) mice. The male WT mice had the best auditory performance and the female WT mice had the worst hearing performance. The male and female STAT1 KO mice had similar auditory performance to each other, which was intermediate between WT males and females. We conclude that both male and female STAT1 KO mice are suitable for studying viral infection-induced hearing loss.","Suzuki, Tomoharu; Maruyama, Junki; Cook, Rebecca; Urata, Shinji; Paessler, Slobodan; Makishima, Tomoko",Neurosci Lett,,264

The world is still more democratic than it was in the 1970s and 1980s, but a trend of autocratization is ongoing and affecting 25 countries in 2020, home to 34% of the world’s population. At the same time, the number of democratizing countries has dwindled by nearly half, reducing to 16 countries, home to a mere 4% of the global population. Freedom of expression, deliberation, rule of law and elections show the most substantial net declines in the last decade. A major change is that India, formerly the world’s largest democracy, turned into an electoral autocracy. The V-Dem data suggests that direct effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on levels of liberal democracy were limited in 2020. Still, the longer-term consequences may be worse and must be monitored closely. Due to the pandemic and state restrictions on the freedom of assembly, mass mobilization declined to its lowest level in over a decade, yet the decline in pro-democracy protests in 2020 may well prove to be short-lived once the pandemic subdues.

We first assess the educational challenges presented by distance learning as a whole and identify 4 main challenges that distance learning currently presents as compared to in-person instruction: the lack of social interaction, reduced student engagement and focus, reduced comprehension and information retention, and the lack of flexible and customizable instructor resources. After assessing each of these challenges in-depth, we examine how AR/VR technologies might serve to address each challenge along with their current shortcomings, and finally outline the further research that is required to fully understand the potential of AR/VR technologies as they apply to distance learning.","Childs, Elizabeth; Mohammad, Ferzam; Stevens, Logan; Burbelo, Hugo; Awoke, Amanuel; Rewkowski, Nicholas; Manocha, Dinesh",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.11000v2.pdf,264

224565,COVID-19 infection in CVID patients: What we know so far,2021,"Privacy in Social Network Sites (SNSs) like Facebook or Instagram is closely related to people's self-disclosure decisions and their ability to foresee the consequences of sharing personal information with large and diverse audiences. Nonetheless, online privacy decisions are often based on spurious risk judgements that make people liable to reveal sensitive data to untrusted recipients and become victims of social engineering attacks. Artificial Intelligence (AI) in combination with persuasive mechanisms like nudging is a promising approach for promoting preventative privacy behaviour among the users of SNSs. Nevertheless, combining behavioural interventions with high levels of personalization can be a potential threat to people's agency and autonomy even when applied to the design of social engineering countermeasures. This paper elaborates on the ethical challenges that nudging mechanisms can introduce to the development of AI-based countermeasures, particularly to those addressing unsafe self-disclosure practices in SNSs. Overall, it endorses the elaboration of personalized risk awareness solutions as i) an ethical approach to counteract social engineering, and ii) as an effective means for promoting reflective privacy decisions.","Ferreyra, Nicolas E.

225344,Association of C-Reactive Protein-to-Albumin Ratio With the Presence and Progression of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a variable clinical presentation that ranges from asymptomatic, to severe disease with cytokine storm. The mortality rates also differ across the globe, ranging from 0.5-13%. This variation is likely due to both pathogen and host factors. Host factors may include genetic differences in the immune response genes as well as variation in HLA and KIR allotypes. To better understand what impact these genetic variants in immune response genes may have in the differences observed in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, a quantitative analysis of a dynamical systems model that considers both, the magnitude of viral growth, and the subsequent innate and adaptive response required to achieve control of infection is considered. Based on this broad quantitative framework it may be posited that the spectrum of symptomatic to severely symptomatic presentations of COVID19 represents the balance between innate and adaptive immune responses. In asymptomatic patients, prompt and adequate adaptive immune response quells infection, whereas in those with severe symptoms a slower inadequate adaptive response leads to a runaway cytokine cascade fueled by ongoing viral replication. Polymorphisms in the various components of the innate and adaptive immune response may cause altered immune response kinetics that would result in variable severity of illness. Understanding how this genetic variation may alter the response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical to develop successful treatment strategies.","Krieger, Elizabeth; Vissichelli, Nicole; Leichtle, Stefan; Kashioris, Markos; Sabo, Roy; Brophy, Don; Wang, Xiang-Yang; Kimbal, Pamela; Neale, Michael; Serrano, Myrna G.; Buck, Gregory A.; Roberts, Catherine; Qayyum, Rehan; Nixon, Daniel; Grossman, Steven; Toor, Amir A.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06541v2.pdf,264

227912,A predictive model for the severity of COVID-19 in elderly patients,2020,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on surgical volume and emergency department (ED) consults across obstetric & gynecologic (OB/GYN) services at a New York City hospital. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study SETTING: Tertiary-care academic medical center in New York City PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Women undergoing OB/GYN ED consults or surgeries between February 1st to April 15th. INTERVENTIONS: March 16th institutional moratorium on elective surgeries MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The volume and types of surgeries and ED consults were compared before and after the COVID-19 moratorium. During the pandemic, the average weekly volume of ED consults and GYN surgeries decreased, while OB surgeries remained stable. The proportions of OBGYN ED consults, GYN surgeries, and OB surgeries relative to all ED consults, all surgeries, and all labor and delivery patients were 1.87%, 13.8%, 54.6% in the pre-COVID timeframe (February 1st to March 15th) versus 1.53%, 21.3%, 79.7% in the COVID timeframe (March 16th to April 15th), representing no significant difference in proportions of OBGYN ED consults (p=0.464) and GYN surgeries (p=0.310) before and during COVID, with proportionate increase in OB surgeries (p<.002). The distribution of GYN surgical case types changed significantly during the pandemic with higher proportions of emergent surgeries for ectopics, miscarriages, and concern for cancer (p <.001). Alternatively, the OB surgery distribution of case types remained relatively constant. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights how the pandemic has impacted the ways OB/GYN patients access and receive care. As expected, institutional policies suspending elective surgeries during the pandemic decreased GYN surgical volume and affected the types of cases performed. This decrease was not appreciated for OB surgical volume reflecting the non-elective and time-sensitive nature of obstetric care. A decrease in ED consults was noted during the pandemic begging the question ""Where have all the emergencies gone?"". Although the moratorium on elective procedures was necessary, ""elective"" GYN surgeries remain medically indicated to address symptoms such as pain and bleeding and to prevent serious medical sequelae such as severe anemia requiring transfusion. As we continue to battle COVID-19, we must not lose sight of those patients whose care has been deferred.","Spurlin, Emily E; Han, Esther S; Silver, Elisabeth R; May, Benjamin L; Tatonetti, Nicholas P; Ingram, Myles A; Jin, Zhezhen; Hur, Chin; Advincula, Arnold P; Hur, Hye-Chun",J. minim. invasive gynecol,,264

230927,"Effect of COVID-19 on childhood Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in Chengdu, China",2021,"BACKGROUND: The widespread nature of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been unprecedented. We sought to analyze its global impact with a survey on colorectal cancer care during the pandemic. METHODS: The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on preoperative assessment, elective surgery, and postoperative management of colorectal cancer patients was explored by a 35-item survey, which was distributed worldwide to members of surgical societies with an interest in colorectal cancer care. Respondents were divided into 2 comparator groups: (1) ""delay"" group: colorectal cancer care affected by the pandemic and (2) ""no delay"" group: unaltered colorectal cancer practice. RESULTS: A total of 1,051 respondents from 84 countries completed the survey. No substantial differences in demographics were found between the delay (745, 70.9%) and no delay (306, 29.1%) groups. Suspension of multidisciplinary team meetings, staff members quarantined or relocated to coronavirus disease 2019 units, units fully dedicated to coronavirus disease 2019 care, and personal protective equipment not readily available were factors significantly associated to delays in endoscopy, radiology, surgery, histopathology, and prolonged chemoradiation therapy-to-surgery intervals. In the delay group, 48.9% of respondents reported a change in the initial surgical plan, and 26.3% reported a shift from elective to urgent operations. Recovery of colorectal cancer care was associated with the status of the outbreak. Practicing in coronavirus disease-free units, no change in operative slots and staff members not relocated to coronavirus disease 2019 units were statistically associated with unaltered colorectal cancer care in the no delay group, while the geographic distribution was not. CONCLUSION: Global changes in diagnostic and therapeutic colorectal cancer practices were evident. Changes were associated with differences in health care delivery systems, hospital's preparedness, resource availability, and local coronavirus disease 2019 prevalence rather than geographic factors. Strategic planning is required to optimize colorectal cancer care.","Santoro, Giulio A; Grossi, Ugo; Murad-Regadas, Sthela; Nunoo-Mensah, Joseph W; Mellgren, Anders; Di Tanna, Gian Luca; Gallo, Gaetano; Tsang, Charles; Wexner, Steven D",Surgery (St. Louis),,264

While safe vaccines were developed, tested and approved at an extraordinary pace, concerns were raised regarding the public's response in accepting the vaccine on the population level. Israel was among the first countries to roll out a massive national campaign for COVID-19 vaccination, positioning Israel as the global lead in vaccine uptake. Priority for vaccination was given to high-risk groups: older and middle-age adults, healthcare workers, senior home residents and caregivers, people with chronic conditions, followed by teachers and soldiers. Contributing to the success of the operation thus far has been a systems approach beyond nationwide accessibility: building public trust through an integrated and familiar health system, a familiar technology (vaccine), transparency regarding vaccine safety information, culturally appropriate messages in digital and offline media, acknowledging diverse health literacy needs, and active participation and role-modeling by political/religious opinion leaders. Vaccine resistance and hesitancy may be encountered as the campaign progresses, and younger groups targeted. Future considerations include perceived benefits offered to people with vaccination and the role of health/digital literacy in preparedness policies.

It seems that the rate of non-compliance with the recommendations among medical students has been as high as the rest of the other youth. In the time that students are removed from clinical environments and most physician teachers are strained in providing services to patients, medical students can be trained in interdisciplinary behavior change counseling programs and they can be employed in delivering virtual consultations to the patients referred to medical centers.In this quick review, we provide an argument regarding the importance of integrating the topic of patients' social history into the undergraduate medical curriculum and the necessity of teaching theories of behavior change to medical students. Hypotheses are proposed that focus on the importance of integrating behavioral and social sciences into the medical curriculum and to teach theories or models of behavior change to students. Health professions educators can design and implement interventions to teach hypothesized models of behavioral change to medical students and evaluate the effectiveness of those interventions. The impacts of such educational interventions on increasing people's compliance with recommendations to improve public health can be evaluated as well.","McKinley, Danette Waller; Ghaffarifar, Saeideh",BMC Med Educ,,264

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computed tomography (CT) scans from major trauma patients (considered as a random population sample) from the radiology department of St George's University Hospitals NHS Trust, London, have been used to explore COVID-19 disease at the population level. RESULTS: At lockdown on 23 March 2020 in the catchment area of St George's University Hospitals NHS Trust, an earlier paper showed that there was a high prevalence of disease of >20%. With further follow-up and at the end of lockdown, it have been now estimated that around 57% of the population had been affected, which was similar to that predicted from a simple model based on average household size and prevalence at lockdown. With an average household size of around three persons, there was a 2-week sustain period and a 5-week decline period before the prevalence of the disease returned to background levels. CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that the effect of lockdown is dependent on the disease prevalence at the start of lockdown and the average household size. It may therefore be important to lockdown early in an area with a high average household size. This paper is the second in a series of papers to show how radiology measurements of major trauma patients can be used to help monitor the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Blanks, R; Adam, E J; Jacob, T M; Patel, J H; Grubnic, S",Clin. radiol,,264

238842,Could ferritin level be an indicator of COVID-19 disease mortality?,2020,"We study equilibrium distancing during epidemics. Distancing reduces the individual's probability of getting infected but comes at a cost. It creates a single-peaked epidemic, flattens the curve and decreases the size of the epidemic. We examine more closely the effects of distancing on the outset, the peak and the final size of the epidemic. First, we define a behavioral basic reproduction number and show that it is concave in the transmission rate. The infection, therefore, spreads only if the transmission rate is in the intermediate region. Second, the peak of the epidemic is non-monotonic in the transmission rate. A reduction in the transmission rate can lead to an increase of the peak. On the other hand, a decrease in the cost of distancing always flattens the curve. Third, both an increase in the infection rate as well as an increase in the cost of distancing increase the size of the epidemic. Our results have important implications on the modeling of interventions. Imposing restrictions on the infection rate has qualitatively different effects on the trajectory of the epidemics than imposing assumptions on the cost of distancing. The interventions that affect interactions rather than the transmission rate should, therefore, be modeled as changes in the cost of distancing.","Fukuda, Satoshi; Kos, Nenad; Wolf, Christoph",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00591v1.pdf,264

During this time, even if physical health is theoretically unaffected, keeping calm and sane can be challenging. The aim of this research was to evaluate whether exposure to COVID-19 information available in the digital space has a different impact on the mental condition of Romanian medical staff, compared with the general population, particularly searching for depression and anxiety symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online survey was conducted from April 6 to 16, 2020 within the Romanian users of Social Media platforms. The questionnaire assessed depression with the WHO-Five Well-Being Index, anxiety with the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale and Social Media exposure by asking how often the respondents saw COVID-19 related information on the most popular Social Media channels in Romania. Information about: gender, age, educational level, occupation, area of living and risk category was also collected. The risk categories were defined as no risk, medium risk and medical staff. RESULTS: Almost 90% of the 402 participants received daily through at least one Social Media channel information related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Social Media Exposure significantly associated with the risk group only for Facebook and LinkedIn. However, exposure to information regarding COVID-19 was neither associated with anxiety nor depression. No significant association was identified neither between age class and self-assessed anxiety nor self-assessed depression. The self-assessment of depression was significantly more frequent as compared with the self-assessment of anxiety. CONCLUSION: The results of this research are opposite to most of the already published literature. Depression and anxiety could not be correlated with the context of lockdown and excessive COVID-19-related information.","CordoÈ, Ariana-Anamaria; Bolboaca, Sorana D",Int J Clin Pract,,264
242331,Longitudinal COVID-19 profiling associates IL-1RA and IL-10 with disease severity and RANTES with mild disease,2020,"ObjectiveThis study assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emergency departments (EDs) in South Australia, measured by changes in the number and casemix of patients in the system over time.MethodsData from the South Australia Emergency Department Dashboard, updated every 30min, were analysed for the period 4 October-21 December 2020. The Dashboard reports live counts of the number and type of patients in each of the six adult metropolitan public EDs in Adelaide, South Australia.ResultsThere was a significant difference in the mean daily average occupied ED capacity before and during two distinct increases in COVID-19 cases in South Australia. An increase in COVID-19 cases coincided with a decrease in patients in EDs (Pearson's r=-0.93 and -0.67; P<0.001 for both). Presentations in Australasian Triage Scale (ATS) Categories 2-5 decreased during these periods, whereas ATS Category 1 stayed constant. Mental health patients continued to present to the ED, despite the overall drop in ED presentations.ConclusionsDuring the two periods of COVID-19 case growth in South Australia, there was a significant drop in the number of patients presenting to the major public EDs and a change in the casemix of patients over time.What is known about the topic?EDs in Australia often operate at or over capacity, with frequent reports of ambulance ramping, access block and long waiting times. There have been reports internationally of significant declines in ED presentations throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.What does this paper add?This paper uses a novel publicly available data source that is available in real time to contribute a new perspective from South Australia, which has experienced two distinct periods of strict restrictions and lockdown. The research showed that the number of mental health presentations remained consistently high, despite a significant overall decline in ED occupancy.What are the implications for practitioners?This study demonstrates that South Australians are accessing emergency medical treatment differently in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the context of an overall decline in presentation numbers, the number of mental health-related presentations has not changed significantly, suggesting that this trend should be closely monitored. The findings corroborate the national concern that unwell people have avoided accessing emergency medical care during the pandemic, leading to worse outcomes and increased need for healthcare resources at a later date. It will be important to monitor and quickly detect further changes in ED usage using real-time data as the pandemic evolves, as well as in any future significant health crises.","Boyle, Laura M; Mackay, Mark; Bean, Nigel; Roughan, Matthew",,,264

However, some classes of stimuli may be able to override our efforts to ignore them. Here we assessed the relationship between involuntary attentional capture with emotional images and spatial attention at early stages of perceptual processing. Multiple scenes of unpleasant and neutral content were displayed in rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) streams that elicited the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP), a neural marker of selective attention at early visual areas. In a spatial cueing task, participants were cued to covertly attend to RSVP streams presented at 4 and 6 Hz presentation rates in the left and right visual hemifields. The task was to detect square targets occasionally displayed within the image streams, responding only to those appearing on the cued side. The RSVP streams were always neutral pictures in one visual hemifield but would unpredictably switch from neutral to aversive content in the other visual hemifield. We found that SSVEP amplitude was consistently modulated by a change in emotional valence of image streams, regardless of whether the change in content occurred in the attended or unattended spatial location, reflecting an automatic sensory amplification for affective stimuli. The present data provide further evidence in support that emotional images can attract visual processing resources independently of spatial attention allocation, and are consistent with sustained sensory facilitation of early visual areas through re-entrant feedback projections from higher-order cortical areas involved in the extraction of affective information.","Bekhtereva, Valeria; Craddock, Matt; Müller, Matthias M",Psychophysiology,,264

This study evaluated changes in daily number of Kentucky emergency medical services (EMS) runs for opioid overdose between January 14, 2020 and April 26, 2020. METHODS: We evaluated the statistical significance of the changes in the average daily EMS opioid overdose runs in the 52 days before and after the COVID-19 state of emergency declaration, March 6, 2020. RESULTS: Kentucky EMS opioid overdose daily runs increased after the COVID-19 state emergency declaration. In contrast, EMS daily runs for other conditions leveled or declined. There was a 17% increase in the number of EMS opioid overdose runs with transportation to an emergency department (ED), a 71% increase in runs with refused transportation, and a 50% increase in runs for suspected opioid overdoses with deaths at the scene. The average daily EMS opioid overdose runs with refused transportation increased significantly, doubled to an average of 8 opioid overdose patients refusing transportation every day during the COVID-19-related study period. CONCLUSIONS: This Kentucky-specific study provides empirical evidence for concerns that opioid overdoses are rising during the COVID-19 pandemic and calls for sharing of observations and analyses from different regions and surveillance systems with timely data collection (e.g., EMS data, syndromic surveillance data for ED visits) to improve our understanding of the situation, inform proactive response, and prevent another big wave of opioid overdoses in our communities.","Slavova, Svetla; Rock, Peter; Bush, Heather M; Quesinberry, Dana; Walsh, Sharon L",Drug Alcohol Depend,,264

The role of arginine in COVID-19 is unknown, but could contribute to cellular damage if low. Our objective was to determine arginine bioavailability in adults and children with COVID-19 vs. healthy controls. We hypothesized that arginine bioavailability would be low in patients with COVID-19 and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). We conducted a prospective observational study of three patient cohorts; arginine bioavailability was determined in asymptomatic healthy controls, adults hospitalized with COVID-19, and hospitalized children/adolescents <21 y old with COVID-19, MIS-C, or asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection identified on admission screen. Mean patient plasma amino acids were compared to controls using the Student's t test. Arginine-to-ornithine ratio, a biomarker of arginase activity, and global arginine bioavailability ratio (GABR, arginine/[ornithine+citrulline]) were assessed in all three groups. A total of 80 patients were included (28 controls, 32 adults with COVID-19, and 20 pediatric patients with COVID-19/MIS-C). Mean plasma arginine and arginine bioavailability ratios were lower among adult and pediatric patients with COVID-19/MIS-C compared to controls. There was no difference between arginine bioavailability in children with COVID-19 vs. MIS-C. Adults and children with COVID-19 and MIS-C in our cohort had low arginine bioavailability compared to healthy adult controls. This may contribute to immune dysregulation and endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19. Low arginine-to-ornithine ratio in patients with COVID-19 or MIS-C suggests an elevation of arginase activity. Further study is merited to explore the role of arginine dysregulation in COVID-19.","Rees, Chris A; Rostad, Christina A; Mantus, Grace; Anderson, Evan J; Chahroudi, Ann; Jaggi, Preeti; Wrammert, Jens; Ochoa, Juan B; Ochoa, Augusto; Basu, Rajit K; Heilman, Stacy; Harris, Frank; Lapp, Stacey A; Hussaini, Laila; Vos, Miriam B; Brown, Lou Ann; Morris, Claudia R",Proc.

Therefore, the study aimed to compare the effect of endurance and endurance-strength training on body composition and cardiometabolic parameters in abdominally obese women. In this randomised trial, 101 subjects were included and divided into endurance (n = 52) and endurance-strength (n = 49) training. During the 12-week intervention, participants performed supervised one-hour training three times a week. Body composition, blood pressure (BP), markers of glucose and lipid homeostasis, and myoglobin levels were measured before and after the intervention. In total, 85 subjects completed the trial. Both interventions decreased fat mass and visceral adipose tissue and increased free fat mass, appendicular lean mass index and lean mass index. Neither endurance training nor endurance-strength training affected glucose and lipid metabolism. However, only endurance training significantly decreased paraoxonase and myoglobin levels. Both training programmes significantly decreased BP, with a more reduction of diastolic BP noted in the endurance group. In conclusion, both training programmes had a favourable effect on body composition but did not improve glucose and lipid homeostasis. Besides, endurance training decreased paraoxonase activity and myoglobin levels and was more effective in reducing BP.The study was registered with the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS) within the number: DRKS00019832 (retrospective registration), date of registration: 26/02/2020.","Jamka, Malgorzata; Madry, Edyta; Krzyzanowska-Jankowska, Patrycja; Skrypnik, Damian; Szulinska, Monika; Madry, Radoslaw; Lisowska, Aleksandra; Batyrova, Gulnara; Dus-Zuchowska, Monika; Gotz-Wieckowska, Anna; Bogdanski, Pawel; Walkowiak, Jaroslaw",Sci Rep,,264

Smartphone has been used for contact tracing by exchanging messages through Bluetooth signals. However, recent confirmed cases found in venues indicated that indirect transmission of the causative virus occurred, resulting from virus contamination of common objects, virus aerosolization in a confined space or spread from inadequate ventilation environment with no indication of human direct or close contact observed.Design/methodology/approachThis paper presents a novel cyber-physical architecture for spatial temporal analytics (iGather for short). Locations with time windows are modeled as digital chromosomes in cyberspace to represent human activity instances in the physical world.FindingsResults show that the high spatial temporal correlated but indirect tracing can be realized through the deployment of physical hardware and spatial temporal analytics including mobility and traceability analytics. iGather is tested and verified in different spatial temporal correlated cases. From a management perspective of mobilizing social capacity, the venue plays not only a promotion role in boosting the utilization rates but also a supervision-assisted role for keeping the venue in a safe and healthy situation.Social implicationsThis research is of particular significance when physical distancing measures are being relaxed with situations gradually become contained. iGather is able to help the general public to ease open questions: Is a venue safe enough? Is there anyone at a gathering at risk? What should one do when someone gets infected without raising privacy issues?Originality/valueThis study contributes to the existing literature by cyber-physical spatial temporal analytics to trace COVID-19 indirect contacts through digital chromosome, a representation of digital twin technology.

There are significant concerns that the arrival of COVID-19 is currently overlapping with other viruses, particularly dengue, in various endo-epidemic regions across South America. In this report, we analyzed trends for both viral infections in Colombia during the first 20 epidemiological weeks of 2020. From January 1st to May 16th, 2020 (epidemiological weeks, EW, 1-20), a total of 52,679 cases of dengue and 14,943 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in Colombia. As both conditions may potentially lead to fatal outcomes, especially in patients with chronic co-morbidities, overlapping infections and co-occurrence may increase the number of patients requiring intensive care and mechanical ventilation. In regions such as Valle del Cauca, intensified preparation for such scenarios should be pondered, and further studies should be performed to address this critical issue in a timely matter.

This study aims to identify patterns of change in eating habits and physical activity during COVID-19 lockdown in Spain and to identify associations with sociodemographic factors and usual habits. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 1155 adults recruited online to answer a 10-section questionnaire. The protocol assessed usual diet by means of a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, usual physical activity (PA) and supplement use, dietary changes, sedentary time, PA, exposure to sunlight, sleep quality, and smoking during confinement. Patterns of dietary change were identified by factor analysis. Factor scores were included in cluster analysis together with change in PA. RESULTS: Six patterns of dietary change were identified that together with PA changes during lockdown defined three clusters of lifestyle change: a cluster less active, a more active cluster, and a third cluster as active as usual. People who were usually less active were more likely to be classified in the cluster that increased physical activity in confinement. Scores of the Healthy Mediterranean-Style dietary pattern were higher in this group. Conclusions: Different patterns of change in lifestyles in confinement suggest the need to tailor support and advice to different population groups.","Pérez-Rodrigo, Carmen; Gianzo Citores, Marta; Hervás Bárbara, Gotzone; Ruiz-Litago, Fátima; Casis Sáenz, Luis; Arija, Victoria; López-Sobaler, Ana M; Martínez de Victoria, Emilio; Ortega, Rosa M; Partearroyo, Teresa; Quiles-Izquierdo, Joan; Ribas-Barba, Lourdes; Rodríguez-Martín, Amelia; Salvador Castell, Gemma; Tur, Josep A; Varela-Moreiras, Gregorio; Serra-Majem, Lluis; Aranceta-Bartrina, Javier",Nutrients,,264

Viral proteins have been described to have the capacity to induce cell death in peripheral blood cells in infections such as HIV. Given the expression of the cognate receptor, ACE-2, on the surface of Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 may induce leukopenia via spike protein ligand-receptor interaction. Methods: PBMCs were isolated from the fresh blood of normal donors and were treated with 1ug/ml of recombinant spike protein, and analyzed for cell death via the Incucyte Live/Cell imaging system. To measure subset specific cell death, PBMCs treated with recombinant spike protein for 48 hours were analyzed by flow cytometry for the expression of cell specific surface receptors and concomitant active caspase 3 expression. Culture supernatant was analyzed by multiplex cytokine analysis to evaluate the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Similar assays were carried out in the presence of a spike- binding domain-antagonistic antibody in order to determine the specific role of spike- ACE2 interaction in causing cell death. Finally, cells from COVID positive patients were analyzed to determine if similar results were observable in-vivo. Results: The treatment of PBMCs with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike resulted in significant cell death over time in 2 out of three donors tested (p&lt;0.05) by IncuCyte live imaging analysis. When analyzed for subset specific cell death, a significant increase in cell death (p&lt;0.01), as measured by Caspase 3, was observed in CD14+CD3- cells, correlating with the monocyte population. Supernatants from these cultures demonstrated markedly increased IL-8 production (p=0.0536). Cultures carried out in the presence of a spike antagonistic antibody abrogated the effects of spike protein, indicating a direct relationship between spike-ACE2 interaction and cell death in this sub-population. Similar flow cytometric analysis from 5 febrile patients with COVID-19 demonstrated significantly increased monocyte apoptosis (p&lt;0.05), compared to CD3+ lymphocytes from the same donors;whereas significantly increased monocyte apoptosis was not observed in 5 afebrile COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: These results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may induce apoptosis specifically in Monocytes, in an ACE2 dependent manner, in some but not all patients.","Chandrasekar, A.

The COVID-19 pandemic has spurred the use of mobile phone location data for pandemic and disaster response. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive review that synthesizes the last decade of work leveraging mobile phone location data and case studies of natural hazards and epidemics. We address this gap by summarizing the existing work, and pointing promising areas and future challenges for using data to support disaster response and recovery.","Yabe, Takahiro; Jones, Nicholas K W; Rao, P Suresh C; Gonzalez, Marta C; Ukkusuri, Satish V",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.02849v1.pdf,264

It also examines its influencing factors among the healthcare workers (HCWs) in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Methods: In this cross-sectional study performed in November and December 2020, a total of 1308 HCWs from two large academic hospitals participated in the Eastern Cape Healthcare Workers Acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 (ECHAS) study. Validated measures of vaccine hesitancy were explored using a questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to identify the determinants of vaccine hesitancy. Results: The majority were nurses (45.2%), and at risk for unfavourable Covid-19 outcome, due to obesity (62.9%) and having direct contact with individuals confirmed to have Covid-19 (77.1%). The overall acceptance of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine was 90.1%, which differed significantly by level of education. Individuals with lower educational attainment (primary and secondary education) and those with prior vaccine refusal were less likely to accept the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. However, positive perceptions about the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were independently associated with vaccine acceptance. Conclusions: The high level of acceptance of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is reassuring;however, HCWs with a lower level of education and those with prior vaccine refusal should be targeted for further engagements to address their concerns and fears.","Adeniyi, Oladele Vincent Stead David Singata-Madliki Mandisa Batting Joanne Wright Matthew Jelliman Eloise Abrahams Shareef Parrish Andrew",Vaccines,,264

273228,COVID-19 in Patients with Lung Cancer - Experience from a Thoracic Oncology Center,2021,"Limb loss due to traumatic injury or amputation is a major biomedical burden. Many vertebrates exhibit the ability to form and pattern normal limbs during embryogenesis from amorphous clusters of precursor cells, hinting that this process could perhaps be activated later in life to rebuild missing or damaged limbs. Indeed, some animals, such as salamanders, are proficient regenerators of limbs throughout their life span. Thus, research over the last century has sought to stimulate regeneration in species that do not normally regenerate their appendages. Importantly, these efforts are not only a vital aspect of regenerative medicine, but also have fundamental implications for understanding evolution and the cellular control of growth and form throughout the body. Here we review major recent advances in augmenting limb regeneration, summarizing the degree of success that has been achieved to date in frog and mammalian models using genetic, biochemical, and bioelectrical interventions. While the degree of whole limb repair in rodent models has been modest to date, a number of new technologies and approaches comprise an exciting near-term road map for basic and clinical progress in regeneration.","Davidian, Devon; Levin, Michael",Cold Spring Harbor perspect. biol,,264

Because COVID-19 is extremely transmissible and can progress to a severe form of respiratory failure, the potential to overwhelm available critical care resources is high and critical care management of COVID-19 patients has been thrust into the spotlight. COVID-19 arrived in the United States in January and, as anticipated, has dramatically increased the usage of critical care resources.

METHODS: We analyzed retrospectively 90 patients with TCC and mean age of 71 years: G1 - 45, G1 - 29, G3 - 16, pTa-1 - 62 and pT2-4 - 28. The superficial TCC were treated TUR plus intravesical BCG (>G1), and the invasives by radical cystectomy and urinary diversion. The mean time of followup was 55 months and 25 patients died of the disease. The rate or reccurence in superficial tumors was 55.5%. The p53 immunoexpression was determined in formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumors sections by the avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase method (DO - 7, Dako). We considered p53 positive TCC when the labeling nuclear index was >10%. RESULTS: P53 immunoexpression exhibited a positive association with tumor grade and stage (p=0.01), but not with the size of primary lesion (p=0.25) or rate of reccurence of pTa-1 tumors (p=0.81). A strong correlation was seen with metastases (p=0.002) and survival (p=0.003). CONCLUSION: A positive reaction for p53 showed correlation with tumor grade, T stage, metastases rate and parient survival, but had no predictive value for local reccurence rate of superficial tumors.","Anastácio Dias Neto, José; Carlos Pereira Martins, Antonio; T.

The single-hazard approach to disaster response system is not suited for this scenario. As shown from the experiences of the Philippines, India, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, the conventional single-hazard approach needed to integrate new measures, including basic skills training on handling COVID-19 for disaster responders; additional stockpiles of face coverings, disinfectants, tents, and personal protective equipment (PPE); social distancing at evacuation centers; updating of standard operation procedures (SOPs) and guidelines for disaster response to adapt to the concurrent crises situations. Building on the reports presented by the member countries of Asian Disaster Reduction Center (ADRC), this paper highlights three evolving disaster response practices during the COVID-19 pandemic: (i) digitalization of some aspects of disaster response, including early warning, surveillance, and impact assessment; (ii) dispersed evacuation to enforce social distancing, including other measures such as testing, tracing, and isolating infected individuals; (iii) remote psychological first aid to disaster-impacted individuals who are already experiencing anxieties from the pandemic. Indicative outcomes of the evolving response practices are discussed, including whether these could serve as entry points to transition the disaster response system from a single-hazard approach towards a multihazard approach.","Potutan, Gerald; Arakida, Masaru",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,264

SE status is a strong predictor of premature morbidity and mortality within general health. A lower SE status also has implications of increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality and poorer CVD risk factor profiles. CVD comorbidity is associated with a higher case severity and mortality rate from COVID-19, with both CVD and COVID-19 sharing important risk factors. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected people of a lower SE status and of ethnic minority group, who in the most deprived regions are suffering double the mortality rate of the least deprived. The acute stress, economic recession and quarantine restrictions in the wake of COVID-19 are also predicted to cause a decline in mental health. This could pose substantial increase to CVD incidence, particularly with acute pathologies such as stroke, acute coronary syndrome and cardiogenic shock among lower SE status individuals and vulnerable elderly populations. Efforts to tackle SE status and CVD may aid in reducing avoidable deaths. The implementation of 'upstream' interventions and policies demonstrates promise in achieving the greatest population impact, aiming to protect and empower individuals. Specific measures may involve risk factor targeting restrictions on the availability and advertisement of tobacco, alcohol and high-fat and salt content food, and targeting SE disparity with healthy and secure workplaces.","Naylor-Wardle, Jeremy; Rowland, Ben; Kunadian, Vijay",Heart,,264

The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) shares some similarities with IPF. SARS-CoV-2 related genes have been reported to be broadly regulated by N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification. Here, we identified the association between m6A methylation regulators, COVID-19 infection pathways, and immune responses in IPF. The characteristic gene expression networks and immune infiltration patterns of m6A-SARS-CoV-2 related genes in different tissues of IPF were revealed. We subsequently evaluated the influence of these related gene expression patterns and immune infiltration patterns on the prognosis/lung function of IPF patients. The IPF cohort was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus dataset. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to identify the correlations among genes or cells. The CIBERSORT algorithm was used to assess the infiltration of 22 types of immune cells. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and proportional hazards model (Cox model) were used to develop the prognosis prediction model.

290160,Chinese Medicine in Fighting against Covid-19: Role and Inspiration,2021,"The recent emergence of the novel pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for a worldwide pandemic. Given the global health emergency, drug repositioning is the most reliable option to design an efficient therapy for infected patients without delay. The first step of the viral replication cycle [i.e. attachment to the surface of respiratory cells, mediated by the spike (S) viral protein] offers several potential therapeutic targets. The S protein uses the angiotension-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor for entry, but also sialic acids linked to host cell surface gangliosides. Using a combination of structural and molecular modelling approaches, this study showed that chloroquine (CLQ), one of the drugs currently under investigation for SARS-CoV-2 treatment, binds sialic acids and gangliosides with high affinity. A new type of ganglioside-binding domain at the tip of the N-terminal domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was identified. This domain (111-158), which is fully conserved among clinical isolates worldwide, may improve attachment of the virus to lipid rafts and facilitate contact with the ACE-2 receptor. This study showed that, in the presence of CLQ [or its more active derivative, hydroxychloroquine (CLQ-OH)], the viral S protein is no longer able to bind gangliosides. The identification of this new mechanism of action of CLQ and CLQ-OH supports the use of these repositioned drugs to cure patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The in-silico approaches used in this study might also be used to assess the efficiency of a broad range of repositioned and/or innovative drug candidates before clinical evaluation.","Fantini, Jacques; Di Scala, Coralie; Chahinian, Henri; Yahi, Nouara",Int J Antimicrob Agents,,264
290201,Interleukin 6-blockade treatment for severe COVID-19 in two patients with multiple myeloma,2020,"AimsTo enable junior doctors to practice their clinical skills in managing psychiatric emergencies via virtual role plays, and to gain confidence and competence in their skills in acute psychiatry. Lecture based learning about psychiatric emergencies is a part of the induction programme for all junior doctors starting their placements however practical learning and practice of skills in this area is not. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated this issue by providing an additional challenge to the delivery of face to face teaching for junior doctors both in clinical and educational settings.MethodThe author offered a virtual role play based teaching session to two cohorts of Junior Doctors (GP trainees and foundation trainees) who were starting their psychiatric hospital placements at Surrey and Borders Partnership. The virtual sessions were conducted over Microsoft teams. This session had been run once before as face to face teaching (F2F) in January 2019 (N = 9) prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from this session were compared to data obtained from the virtual sessions in November 2020 and January 2021 (N = 16).Pre and post study questionnaires were administered via Microsoft Forms. Each session lasted 1 hour and consisted of 3 different role play scenarios based around acute psychiatric emergencies. One junior doctor volunteer acted as the ‘patient’ in each scenario and another volunteer as the ‘doctor’. The other participants all acted as observers. Each scenario lasted 10 minutes with ten minutes for feedback from the researcher afterwards using the ALOBA framework.Categorical, ordinal data were collected using a Likert scale and general qualitative feedback was also gathered.ResultThe questionnaire return rate was 100% for F2F teaching and 57% for virtual teaching. 100% of participants felt that F2F role play was an acceptable way to practice skills in acute psychiatry vs 75% of participants who felt this about virtual role play. 100% of participants found that F2F role play was ‘quite’ or ‘very’ effective in improving their confidence and perceived competence in acute psychiatry vs 88% of participants who felt this about virtual role play.ConclusionVirtual role play based learning is an acceptable and effective method in improving the confidence and perceived competence of junior doctors undertaking on call shifts in inpatient psychiatry but it appears to be less effective than face to face role play based learning. The researcher will act upon the qualitative feedback obtained which suggested ways in which the virtual session could be improved.","Gardner, Katherine",BJPsych Open,,264

Rationing policies for pandemics differ by institution, health system, and applicable law. Most seem to agree that a patient's ability to benefit from treatment and to survive are first-order considerations. However, there is debate about what clinical measures should be used to make that determination and about other factors that might be ethically appropriate to consider. In this paper, we discuss resource allocation and several related ethical challenges to the healthcare system and society, including how to define benefit, how to handle informed consent, the special needs of pediatric patients, how to engage communities in these difficult decisions, and how to mitigate concerns of discrimination and the effects of structural inequities.","McGuire, Amy L; Aulisio, Mark P; Davis, F Daniel; Erwin, Cheryl; Harter, Thomas D; Jagsi, Reshma; Klitzman, Robert; Macauley, Robert; Racine, Eric; Wolf, Susan M; Wynia, Matthew; Wolpe, Paul Root",Am J Bioeth,,264

This has led to further expansion in clinical indications from graft rejection, autoimmune diseases, and osteoarthritis, to inflammatory liver and pulmonary diseases including COVID-19. A clear trend is the shift from using autologous to allogeneic MSCs, which can be immediately available as off-the-shelf products. In addition, new products such as cell-free exosomes and human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived MSCs are exciting developments to further prevalent use. Increasing numbers of trials have now published results in which safety of MSCT has been largely demonstrated. While reports of therapeutic endpoints are still emerging, efficacy can be seen for specific indications-including graft-vs-host-disease, strongly Th17-mediated autoimmune diseases, and osteoarthritis-which are more robustly supported by mechanistic preclinical evidence. In this review, we update and discuss outcomes in current MSCT clinical trials for immune and inflammatory disease, as well as new innovation and emerging trends in the field.","Wang, Li-Tzu; Liu, Ko-Jiunn; Sytwu, Huey-Kang; Yen, Men-Luh; Yen, B Linju",Stem cells transl. med.

Data of 23 hospitalized children with COVID-19 (9 boys, 5.7 ± 3.8 years old) were compared with age- and sex-matched 69 hospitalized and 69 outpatient children with influenza A from a hospital in China. The participants' epidemiological history, family cluster, clinical manifestations, and blood test results were assessed. Compared with either inpatients or outpatients with influenza A, children with COVID-19 showed significantly more frequent family infections and higher ratio of low fever (< 37.3 °C), but shorter cough and fever duration, lower body temperature, and lower rates of cough, fever, high fever (> 39 °C), nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, vomiting, myalgia or arthralgia, and febrile seizures. They also showed higher counts of lymphocytes, T lymphocyte CD8, and platelets and levels of cholinesterase, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and lactic acid, but lower serum amyloid, C-reactive protein, and fibrinogen levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and shorter prothrombin time. The level of alanine aminotransferase in children with COVID-19 is lower than that in inpatients but higher than that in outpatients with influenza A. Pediatric COVID-19 is associated with more frequent family infection, milder symptoms, and milder immune responses relative to pediatric influenza A.","Zhao, Yang; Sun, De Lin; Bouchard, Heather C; Zhang, Xin Xin; Wan, Gang; Hao, Yi Wei; He, Shu Xin; Jiang, Yu Yong; Pang, Lin",Biomed Environ Sci,,264
291209,Liver histopathology in severe COVID 19 respiratory failure is suggestive of vascular alterations,2020,"BACKGROUND: Although by late February 2020 the COVID-19 epidemic was effectively controlled in Wuhan, China, estimating the effects of interventions, such as transportation restrictions and quarantine measures, on the early COVID-19 transmission dynamics in Wuhan is critical for guiding future virus containment strategies. Since the exact number of infected cases is unknown, the number of documented cases was used by many disease transmission models to infer epidemiological parameters. This means that it was possible to produce biased estimates of epidemiological parameters and hence of the effects of intervention measures, because the percentage of all cases that were documented changed during the first 2 months of the epidemic, as a consequence of a gradually improving diagnostic capability. METHODS: To overcome these limitations, we constructed a stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected-quarantined-recovered (SEIQR) model, accounting for intervention measures and temporal changes in the proportion of new documented infections out of total new infections, to characterize the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan across different stages of the outbreak. Pre-symptomatic transmission was taken into account in our model, and all epidemiological parameters were estimated using the Particle Markov-chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) method. RESULTS: Our model captured the local Wuhan epidemic pattern as two-peak transmission dynamics, with one peak on February 4 and the other on February 12, 2020. The impact of intervention measures determined the timing of the first peak, leading to an 86% drop in the Re from 3.23 (95% CI, 2.22 to 4.20) to 0.45 (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.69). The improved diagnostic capability led to the second peak and a higher proportion of documented infections. Our estimated proportion of new documented infections out of the total new infections increased from 11% (95% CI 1-43%) to 28% (95% CI 4-62%) after January 26 when more detection kits were released. After the introduction of a new diagnostic criterion (case definition) on February 12, a higher proportion of daily infected cases were documented (49% (95% CI 7-79%)). CONCLUSIONS: Transportation restrictions and quarantine measures together in Wuhan were able to contain local epidemic growth.","Liang, Jingbo; Yuan, Hsiang-Yu; Wu, Lindsey; Pfeiffer, Dirk Udo",BMC Infect Dis,,264

The aim of this umbrella review of meta-analyses is to determine the prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using relevant keywords, data resources including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, ProQuest, Science Direct, Google Scholar and Embase were searched to obtain systematic reviews and meta-analyses reporting the prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic from the beginning of January to the end of October 2020. The random effects model was used for meta-analysis, and the I2 index was employed to assess heterogeneity among studies. Data was analyzed using STATA 14 software. RESULTS: In the primary search, 103 studies were identified, and ultimately 7 studies were included in the umbrella review. The results showed that the overall prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic was 24.94% (95% CI: 21.83-28.05, I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.804) and 24.83% (95% CI: 21.41-28.25, I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.897), respectively. CONCLUSION: This umbrella review shows that the prevalence of anxiety and depression is relatively high among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare workers should be provided with resources to minimize this risk.","Sahebi, Ali; Nejati-Zarnaqi, Bayram; Moayedi, Siamak; Yousefi, Kosar; Torres, Mercedes; Golitaleb, Mohamad",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,,264

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. METHODS: Adults with VI (best-corrected visual acuity <20/60 in the better-seeing eye), HI (ICD-10 codes), and age- and sex-matched controls (n=375) were recruited from the University of Michigan. The 34-item Coronavirus Disability Survey was administered. Chi-squared and logistic regression were used to compare survey responses between groups. RESULTS: All groups reported high levels of disruption of daily life with 80% reporting ""a fair amount"" or ""a lot"" of disruption (VI:76%, HI:83%, CT: 82%, p=0.33). Participants with VI had greater difficulty with day-to-day activities and were more likely to cite the following reasons: caregiver was worried about COVID-19 (ORVI=7.2, [95% CI 3.5-14.4], p<.001) and decreased availability of public transportation (ORVI=5.0, [95% CI 1.5-15.6], p=.006). Those with VI, but not HI, showed a trend toward increased difficulty accessing medical care (ORVI=2.0, [95% CI 0.99-4.0], p=.052) and they began relying more on others for day-to-day assistance (ORVI=3.1, [95% CI 1.6-5.7], p<.001). Overall, 30% reported difficulty obtaining trusted information about the pandemic. Those with VI reported more difficulty seeing or hearing trusted information (ORVI=6.1, [95% CI 1.6-22.1], p=.006). Employed participants with HI were more likely to report a reduction in wages (ORHI=2.5, [95% CI 1.2-5.3], p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with VI have experienced increased disruption and challenges in daily activities related to the pandemic. People with SI may benefit from targeted policy approaches to the current pandemic and future stressors. Minimal differences in some survey measures may be due to the large impact of the pandemic on the population as a whole.","Bernard, Alec; Weiss, Sara; Rahman, Moshiur; Ulin, Sheryl S; D039,; Souza, Clive; Salgat, Anah; Panzer, Kate; Stein, Joshua D; Meade, Michelle A; McKee, Michael M; Ehrlich, Joshua R",Am. j. ophthalmol,,264

294923,Liver injury in COVID-19: Diagnosis and associated factors,2020,"With each infectious pandemic or outbreak, the medical community feels the need to revisit basic concepts of immunology to understand and overcome the difficult times brought about by these infections. Regarding viruses, they have historically been responsible for many deaths, and such a peculiarity occurs because they are known to be obligate intracellular parasites that depend upon the host's cell machinery for their replication. Successful infection with the production of essential viral components requires constant viral evolution as a strategy to manipulate the cellular environment, including host internal factors, the host's nonspecific and adaptive immune responses to viruses, the metabolic and energetic state of the infected cell, and changes in the intracellular redox environment during the viral infection cycle. Based on this knowledge, it is fundamental to develop new therapeutic strategies for controlling viral dissemination, by means of antiviral therapies, vaccines, or antioxidants, or by targeting the inhibition or activation of cell signaling pathways or metabolic pathways that are altered during infection. The rapid recovery of altered cellular homeostasis during viral infection is still a major challenge. Here, we review the strategies by which viruses evade the host's immune response and potential tools used to develop more specific antiviral therapies to cure, control, or prevent viral diseases.","Strumillo, Scheilla T; Kartavykh, Denis; de Carvalho, Fábio F; Cruz, Nicolly C; de Souza Teodoro, Ana C; Sobhie Diaz, Ricardo; Curcio, Marli F",Cell Biol Int,,264

296295,Experience and Outcome of COVID-19-Positive Lung Cancer Patients from a Eastern Indian Hospital,2021,"Current evidence suggests that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is predominantly transmitted from human-to-human. However, evidence on vertical transmission and natural passive immunity among the newborns exposed to COVID-19 is scanty and varies. This poses a challenge on preventive interventions for the newborns. We conducted a systematic review to first, determine the likelihood of vertical transmission among COVID-19 exposed infants and second, determine whether antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were generated among COVID-19 vertically exposed but negative infants. This review registered in PROSPERO searched evidence from PubMed/MEDLINE and Google Scholar, among others. About 517 studies were pooled, where 33 articles (5.8%) met the inclusion criteria such as infection prevention and control measures at birth. A total of 205 infants born to COVID-19 positive mothers were studied. Overall, 6.3% (13/205; 95% CI: 3.0%-9.7%) of the infants tested positive for COVID-19 virus at birth. Of 33 eligible studies, six studies (18.8%) reported about immunoglobulin G/M (IgG/IgM) against SARS-CoV-2. IgG/IgM were detected in 90% infants (10/11; 95% CI: 73.9%-107.9%) who tested negative for COVID-19 virus. The median antibody levels detected were 75.49 AU/ml (range, 7.25-140.32 AU/ml) and 3.79 AU/ml (range, 0.16-45.83 AU/ml), p = .0041 for IgG and IgM, respectively. In conclusion, the current evidence revealed a low possibility of vertical transmission of COVID-19 and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected among vertically exposed but negative infants. Further studies on transplacental transmission and the magnitude of natural passive immunity in infants born to mothers with COVID-19 are warranted.","Bwire, George M; Njiro, Belinda J; Mwakawanga, Dorkasi L; Sabas, Deodatus; Sunguya, Bruno F",J. med. virol,,264
298290,Patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis on TNF inhibitors exposed to COVID-19 family members,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a newly emerging human infectious disease. Because no specific antiviral drugs or vaccines are available to treat COVID-19, early diagnostics, isolation, and prevention are crucial for containing the outbreak. Molecular diagnostics using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are the current gold standard for detection. However, viral RNAs are much less stable during transport and storage than proteins such as antigens and antibodies. Consequently, false-negative RT-PCR results can occur due to inadequate collection of clinical specimens or poor handling of a specimen during testing. Although antigen immunoassays are stable diagnostics for detection of past infection, infection progress, and transmission dynamics, no matched antibody pair for immunoassay of SARS-CoV-2 antigens has yet been reported. In this study, we designed and developed a novel rapid detection method for SARS-CoV-2 spike 1 (S1) protein using the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2, which can form matched pairs with commercially available antibodies. ACE2 and S1-mAb were paired with each other for capture and detection in a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) that did not cross-react with SARS-CoV Spike 1 or MERS-CoV Spike 1 protein. The SARS-CoV-2 S1 (<5 ng of recombinant proteins/reaction) was detected by the ACE2-based LFIA. The limit of detection of our ACE2-LFIA was 1.86 × 105 copies/mL in the clinical specimen of COVID-19 Patients without no cross-reactivity for nasal swabs from healthy subjects. This is the first study to detect SARS-CoV-2 S1 antigen using an LFIA with matched pair consisting of ACE2 and antibody.

The aim of the present study was to investigate PTSD, Burnout and global functioning in a sample of emergency healthcare workers (HCWs) of a major University Hospital of Italy, exploring possible correlations between the two constructs. METHODS: The study sample included 137 medical and nursing Emergency Room and Intensive Care Unit staff of a major University Hospital in Italy (Pisa), all assessed by means of the Trauma and Loss Spectrum-Self Report (TALS-SR), for post-traumatic stress spectrum, the Professional Quality of Life Scale - Revision IV (ProQOL R-IV), for Burnout related to work activities, and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), for global functioning. RESULTS: Fourty-nine subjects reported a full (18, 14.3%) or partial (31, 24.6%) symptomatological DSM-5 PTSD. HCWs with PTSD reported significantly higher Burnout scores and global functioning impairment compared to those without PTSD. Mean to good significant correlations emerged between the TALS-SR total and domains scores, the ProQOL subscales and the WSAS scores. CONCLUSIONS: This work, conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic, underlines a positive correlation between Burnout and Post-Traumatic Stress Spectrum symptoms in Emergency HCWs, showing the need for a deeper assessment of work-related posttraumatic stress symptoms in such population in order to improve the well-being and to prevent Burnout.","Carmassi, Claudia; Malacarne, Paolo; Dell039,; Oste, Valerio; Bertelloni, Carlo A; Cordone, Annalisa; Foghi, Claudia; Osso, Liliana",Minerva anestesiol,,264

Presented is a conglomerate neural network system consisting of multiple VGG16 CNNs; the system trains on weighted skin disease images re-labelled as critical or non-critical, to then attach to input images a critical index between 0 and 10. A critical index offers a more comprehensive rating system compared to binary critical/non-critical labels. Results for batches of input images run through the trained network are promising. A batch is shown being re-ordered by the proposed architecture from most critical to least critical roughly accurately.","Ghantasala, Lakshmi A.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.12783v1.pdf,264

Impaired spiral artery remodeling contributes to preeclampsia, a major disease in pregnancy. Corin, a transmembrane serine protease, is up-regulated in the pregnant uterus to promote spiral artery remodeling. To date, the mechanism underlying uterine corin up-regulation remains unknown. Here we show that Krüppel-like factor (KLF) 17 is a key transcription factor for uterine corin expression in pregnancy. In cultured human uterine endometrial cells, KLF17 binds to the CORIN promoter and enhances the promoter activity. Disruption of the KLF17 gene in the endometrial cells abolishes CORIN expression. In mice, Klf17 is up-regulated in the pregnant uterus. Klf17 deficiency prevents uterine Corin expression in pregnancy. Moreover, Klf17-deficient mice have poorly remodeled uterine spiral arteries and develop gestational hypertension and proteinuria. Together, our results reveal an important function of KLF17 in regulating Corin expression and uterine physiology in pregnancy.","Wang, Can; Wang, Zhiting; He, Meiling; Zhou, Tiantian; Niu, Yayan; Sun, Shengxuan; Li, Hui; Zhang, Ce; Zhang, Shengnan; Liu, Meng; Xu, Ying; Dong, Ningzheng; Wu, Qingyu",Proc.

Here, a simple one-pot method of thermal polymerization is introduced to fabricate silk fibroin-dopted hydrogels (SFHs), which are both chemically and physically cross-linked by acrylamide (AM), acrylic acid (AA), and silk fibroin (SF). The addition of SF can effectively enhance the mechanical property of the SFH12% by 59% compared with SFH0% . Taking the advantage of its wide working range of stress (about 0.455-568.9 kPa), the SFH can work as a resistance-type pressure sensor to monitor different human motions. What is more, the excellent adhesion, about 75.17 N m-1 of SFH46% enables it to fit tightly to other objects during the testing, which significantly reduces the loss of small signals due to poor fit. In addition, the SFH demonstrates excellent self-healing property without requiring external excitation and a sensitive temperature response in the range of -10 to 60 °C. The SFH is expected to be applied in the field of electronic skin, soft robots, and other flexible electronic products as well as speech recognition.","Zhao, Li; Zhao, Jizhong; Zhang, Fan; Xu, Zijie; Chen, Fan; Shi, Yating; Hou, Chen; Huang, Yicheng; Lin, Changjian; Yu, Rui; Guo, Wenxi",Adv Healthc Mater,,264

Despite being mainly a respiratory virus, cardiac complications have been described. These range from sudden cardiac death to subtle diastolic dysfunction after recovery from COVID-19. The commonest cardiac presentation to date is acute heart failure resulting from biventricular or left ventricular hypokinesis and elevation of cardiac troponins. It has been shown that COVID-19 downregulates angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, which has protective effects on the endothelium and cardiomyocytes. It has also been proven that COVID-19 induces a state of hypercytokinaemia, some cytokines such as interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 have an injurious effect on the myocardium and endothelium, respectively. Such pathogenic mechanisms might play a crucial role in induction of cardiomyocyte injury and impaired myocardial perfusion probably through coronary endothelial dysfunction. The understanding and linking of such mechanisms might help in tailoring drug repurposing for treatment or prophylaxis of COVID-19 cardiovascular complications.","AbdelMassih, Antoine Fakhry; Ramzy, David; Nathan, Lauren; Aziz, Silvia; Ashraf, Mirette; Youssef, Nourhan Hatem; Hafez, Nouran; Saeed, Rana; Agha, Hala",Cardiovasc Endocrinol Metab,,264

Abnormal deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins is a key factor in the development of tissue remodelling that results in symptoms and impaired lung function in these diseases. Tissue remodelling in the lungs is complex and differs between compartments. Some pathways are common but tissue remodelling around the airways and in the parenchyma have different morphologies. Hence it is critical to evaluate both common fibrotic pathways and those that are specific to different compartments; thereby expanding the understanding of the pathogenesis of fibrosis and remodelling in the airways and parenchyma in asthma, COPD and IPF with a view to developing therapeutic strategies for each. Here we review the current understanding of remodelling features and underlying mechanisms in these major respiratory diseases. The differences and similarities of remodelling are used to highlight potential common therapeutic targets and strategies. One central pathway in remodelling processes involves transforming growth factor (TGF)-ß induced fibroblast activation and myofibroblast differentiation that increases ECM production. The current treatments and clinical trials targeting remodelling are described, as well as potential future directions. These endeavours are indicative of the renewed effort and optimism for drug discovery targeting tissue remodelling and fibrosis.","Liu, Gang; Philp, Ashleigh M; Corte, Tamera; Travis, Mark A; Schilter, Heidi; Hansbro, Nicole G; Burns, Chris J; Eapen, Mathew S; Sohal, Sukhwinder S; Burgess, Janette K; Hansbro, Philip M",Pharmacol Ther,,264

We analyzed the association of both outbreaks with wildlife diet in China and proposed suggestions for regulating wildlife conservation and food safety to prevent human exposure to the novel virus, including increasing social awareness of hazards in eating wild animals, strengthening legislation on eating and trading of wild animals, improving the standards for food safety, and establishing market supervision mechanism. Regulatory intervention is not only critical for China but also for other countries where wildlife hunting is prevalent to prevent from novel virus exposures.","Yuan, Jingjing; Lu, Yonglong; Cao, Xianghui; Cui, Haotian",Ecosyst.

This study investigated the possibility of using an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (RdRp) as a target for molecular characterization of IBV strains in Iran. Trachea samples were collected from commercial broiler flocks (n = 52) showing respiratory syndrome. Specific PCR primers were designed for a variable region located in the RdRp gene flanked by highly conserved regions. Reverse transcriptase PCR followed by sequence analysis identified eight IBV variants, with an overall prevalence of 44.2%. Deduced nucleotide and amino acid sequences were compared with published sequences for IBV strains. Because of the long-distance similarities, the field samples could be discriminated from vaccine strains. Phylogenetic analysis of RdRp gene sequences resulted in clustering of the IBV strains related to each area. Using RdRp as a genetic marker eliminates the challenges arising from the enormous variations that make it difficult to discriminate between field and vaccine strains as well as affiliate certain variants to various geographical areas.","Hajijafari Anaraki, Mozafar; Sheikhi, Nariman; Haghbin Nazarpak, Hadi; Nikbakht Brujeni, Gholamreza",Microbiol Immunol,,264

The case group consisted of 72 males and 28 females. 40 healthy adults without any history or clinical evidence suggestive of COVID-19 and without any comorbidities, like diabetes, hypertension chronic lung disease, cardiac disease, cancer, and immune-compromised individuals were considered as a control group for the study. Routine laboratory findings of these 100 patients were used to evaluate the abnormalities found in COVID-19 patients. Statistical analysis was carried out on the data after determining whether the data had a normal/log-normal distribution and their significance was determined by calculating the p-value. The percentage of patients showing a decrease or increase from the normal value was calculated. Trend analysis was carried out for the 100 patients considered in the case group. Among them, 6 patients were used as representatives to show the trend in these biomarkers during the course of hospital stay. These 5 severe cases consisted of 2 adult males, 2 adult females, and 1 adolescent girl. This selection is to demonstrate the representation of COVID-19 infection in adult males and females and pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19 in the younger age group. One mild case (adult male) was also selected in the case study. We found a significant increase in mean values of AST, ALT, Total Billirubin, Creatinine, CRP, PCT, LDH, IL6, Ferritin, Lactate, hsTroponin I, NT Pro BNP and decrease in mean values of Albumin, SO2, and PO2 in COVID 19 cases than control.

The Multimodal Restricted Boltzmann Machine approach (MM-RBM), which has the capability to connect the information about the multiple modalities, can be applied to the problem of drug repurposing. The present study utilized MM-RBM to combine two types of data, including the chemical structures data of small molecules and differentially expressed genes as well as small molecules perturbations. In the proposed method, two separate RBMs were applied to find out the features and the specific probability distribution of each datum (modality). Besides, RBM was used to integrate the discovered features, resulting in the identification of the probability distribution of the combined data. The results demonstrated the significance of the clusters acquired by our model. These clusters were used to discover the medicines which were remarkably similar to the proposed medications to treat COVID-19. Moreover, the chemical structures of some small molecules as well as dysregulated genes' effect led us to suggest using these molecules to treat COVID-19. The results also showed that the proposed method might prove useful in detecting the highly promising remedies for COVID-19 with minimum side effects.

A number of already approved and marketed drugs are being tested for repurposing, including Favipiravir. We aim to investigate the efficacy and safety of Favipiravir in treatment of COVID-19 patients through a systematic review and meta-analysis. This systematic review and meta-analysis were reported in accordance with the PRISMA statement. We registered the protocol in the PROSPERO (CRD42020180032). All clinical trials which addressed the safety and efficacy of Favipiravir in comparison to other control groups for treatment of patients with confirmed infection with SARS-CoV2 were included. We searched electronic databases including LitCovid/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Sciences, Cochrane, and Scientific Information Database up to 31 December 2020. We assessed the risk of bias of the included studies using Cochrane Collaboration criteria. All analyses were performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software version 2, and the risk ratio index was calculated. Egger and Begg test was used for assessing publication bias. Nine studies were included in our meta-analysis. The results of the meta-analysis revealed a significant clinical improvement in the Favipiravir group versus the control group during seven days after hospitalization (RR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.09-1.41; P = 0.001). Viral clearance was more in 14 days after hospitalization in Favipiravir group than control group, but this finding marginally not significant (RR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.98-1.25; P = 0.094). Requiring supplemental oxygen therapy in the Favipiravir group was 7% less than the control group, (RR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.67-1.28; P = 0.664). Transferred to ICU and adverse events were not statistically different between two groups. The mortality rate in the Favipiravir group was approximately 30% less than the control group, but this finding not statistically significant. Favipiravir possibly exerted no significant beneficial effect in the term of mortality in the general group of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. We should consider that perhaps the use of antiviral once the patient has symptoms is too late and this would explain their low efficacy in the clinical setting.","Hassanipour, Soheil; Arab-Zozani, Morteza; Amani, Bahman; Heidarzad, Forough; Fathalipour, Mohammad; Martinez-de-Hoyo, Rudolph",Sci Rep,,264

322467,Hazards of the Cytokine Storm and Cytokine-Targeted Therapy in Patients With COVID-19: Review,2020,"BACKGROUND: There is little evidence about how novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) affects pregnant women and their newborns. Comparisons with other members of the coronavirus family responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have been done to predict maternal and neonatal outcomes; however, more information is required to establish clinical patterns, disease evolution and pregnancy prognosis in this group of patients. METHODS: This paper is reporting a series of 91 women diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and puerperium. The analysis showed that 40 patients developed pneumonia, bilateral in most cases, with a 46.2% rate of hospitalization and 4 patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. In confront with previous publications, we have found a higher rate of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) severe forms, even when compared to non-pregnant women with the same baseline characteristics. We have analyzed the demographic characteristics, pregnancy-related conditions and presenting symptoms to identify features that could determine which patients will need hospitalization because of COVID-19 (Group 1-G1) and those who not (Group 2-G2). We have found that obesity and Latin-American origin behave as risk factors: OR: 4.3; 95% CI: 1.4-13.2, and OR: 2.6; 95% CI: 1.1 - 6.2, respectively. Among the 23 patients that delivered with active SARS-CoV-2, the overall rate of cesarean section (CS) and preterm birth were 52.2% and 34.8%, respectively, but we observed that the rate of CS was even higher in G1 compared to G2: 81.8% versus 25%, p = .012. However, prematurity was equally distributed in both groups and only one preterm delivery was determined by poor maternal condition. There were no deaths among the patients neither their newborns. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the results of our cohort reveal that SARSC-CoV-2 infection may not behave as mild as suggested during pregnancy, especially when factors as obesity or Latin-American origin are present. No evidence of late vertical transmission was noticed but prematurity and high CS rate were common findings, although it is difficult to establish any causality between these conditions and COVID-19. Further evidence is required to establish if pregnancy itself can lead to severe forms of COVID-19 disease and whether risk factors for the general population are applicable to obstetric patients. Until larger studies are available, pregnant women should be monitored carefully to anticipate severe complications.","Barbero, Patricia; Mugüerza, Laura; Herraiz, Ignacio; García Burguillo, Antonio; San Juan, Rafael; Forcén, Laura; Mejía, Inmaculada; Batllori, Emma; Montañez, María Dolores; Vallejo, Paloma; Villar, Olga; García Alcazar, Diana; Galindo, Alberto",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,,264

In this study, we investigated the associations of SES with self-reported, tested and diagnosed COVID-19 status in the general population. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants were 49 474 men and women (46±12 years) residing in the Northern Netherlands from the Lifelines cohort study. SES indicators and lifestyle factors (i.e., smoking status, physical activity, alcohol intake, diet quality, sleep time and TV watching time) were assessed by questionnaire from the Lifelines Biobank. Self-reported, tested and diagnosed COVID-19 status was obtained from the Lifelines COVID-19 questionnaire. RESULTS: There were 4711 participants who self-reported having had a COVID-19 infection, 2883 participants tested for COVID-19, and 123 positive cases were diagnosed in this study population. After adjustment for age, sex, lifestyle factors, body mass index and ethnicity, we found that participants with low education or low income were less likely to self-report a COVID-19 infection (OR [95% CI]: low education 0.78 [0.71 to 0.86]; low income 0.86 [0.79 to 0.93]) and be tested for COVID-19 (OR [95% CI]: low education 0.58 [0.52 to 0.66]; low income 0.86 [0.78 to 0.95]) compared with high education or high income groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the low SES group was the most vulnerable population to self-reported and tested COVID-19 status in the general population.","Zhu, Yinjie; Duan, Ming-Jie; Dijk, Hermien H; Freriks, Roel D; Dekker, Louise H; Mierau, Jochen O",BMJ Open,,264

METHOD: Literature review. RESULTS: Altogether 28 articles were found, which reported 48 patients with SARS-CoV-2-associated infectious/immune-mediatedCNS-disease. Age ranged from 22 to 79y. There was male preponderance. There were 14 patients with infectious CNS-disease (meningitis (n = 1), encephalitis (n = 5), meningo-encephalitis (n = 5), myelitis (n = 3)), and 34 patients with parainfectious CNS-disease (encephalopathy (n = 18), autoimmune encephalitis (n = 11), acute, disseminated, encephalo-myelitis (n = 3), acute, haemorrhagic, necrotizing encephalopathy (n = 2)). The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was tested for SARS-CoV-2 in 40 patients and was positive for the virus in 4 patients with infectious CNS-disease but was negative for the virus in all patients with parainfectious CNS-disease. Immune-modulating treatment may be more effective than virostatics/antibiotics for SARS-CoV-2-associated infectious/parainfectious, non-vascular, non-hypoxic CNS-disease. In patients with autoimmune encephalitis plasmapheresis may be beneficial. Twenty-two patients recovered, 2 did not, and 6 patients died. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 can cause infectious/immune-mediatedCNS-disease. The CSF is positive for virus-RNA in only few patients with infectious CNS-disease but negative for virus-RNA in immune-mediatedCNS-disease, suggesting an immune-mediated pathophysiological mechanism. The outcome of SARS-CoV-2-associated infectious/immune-mediatedCNS-disease is favourable in the majority of cases but can be fatal in single cases.","Finsterer, Josef; Scorza, Fulvio A",J Clin Neurosci,,264

Currently, MSCs are being explored against the novel infectious disease due to their therapeutic properties of anti-inflammation, immunomodulation and tissue repair and regeneration, albeit the precise mechanisms of MSC action toward COVID-19 remain unclear. To date, rigorous results from clinical trials using MSCs in human have been weakly positive. The pervasive uncertainty of using MSC therapeutic products as an effective combatant against COVID-19 requires rigorous resolution on several fronts, including MSC fate after infusion, safety issue, homing capability, and MSC resistance to the disease microenvironment. Focusing on these facets, a few important ones will be critically analyzed and addressed in this article for the development of safe and effective MSC-based therapies for COVID-19.","Li, Chenghai; Zhao, Hua; Wang, Bin",Drug Des Devel Ther,,264

METHODS Sixty-two cases receiving favipiravir treatment for at least five days due to COVID-19 infection were evaluated retrospectively. Parameters including age, gender, nasopharyngeal swab positivity, and chronic diseases were analyzed. Hematologic parameters were analyzed before and after the treatment. RESULTS The mean age of the patients receiving treatment with favipiravir was 63.7±12.3 years. Nasopharyngeal swab positivity was detected in 67.7%. The most common comorbid conditions detected in patients were hypertension in 25 cases (40.3%) and diabetes in 16 cases (25.8%). In the statistical analysis of the hematological parameters before and after treatment with favipiravir, WBC, PT-PTT-INR levels were found to be unaffected; the mean RBC was found to have decreased from 4.33 ± 0.58 M/uL to 4.16 ± 0.54 M/uL (p:0.003); the median hemoglobin level was found to have decreased from 12.3 g/dl to 11.9 g/dl (p:0.041); the hematocrit level decreased from 38.1% ± 4.8 to 36.9% ± 4.2 (p:0.026); the median neutrophil count decreased from 4.57 K/uL to 3.85 K/uL (p:0.001); the mean lymphocyte count increased from 1.22 ± 0.53 K/uL to 1.84 ± 1.19 K/uL (p:0.000); and the mean platelet count increased from 244.1 ± 85.1 K/uL to 281.9 ± 103.3 K/uL (p:0.005).

Using ELISA, we quantified an average of 1100, 6200, and 2500 receptors per follicle cell (FC) at stages 8/9, 10, and &#8805;11 of oogenesis, respectively. Interestingly, the spatial localization of the EGFR to the apical side of the FCs at early stages depended on the TGF-alpha-like ligand Gurken. At later stages, EGFR localized to basolateral positions of the FCs. Finally, we followed the endosomal localization of EGFR in the FCs. The EGFR co-localized with the late endosome, but no significant co-localization of the receptor was found with the early endosome. The EGFR-sfGFP fly is an exciting new resource to study cellular localization and regulation of EGFR in tissues.","Revaitis, Nicole T; Niepielko, Matthew G; Marmion, Robert A; Klein, Eric A; Piccoli, Benedetto; Yakoby, Nir",Development (Camb.),,264

A community sample of women, ages 18-39, who had either given birth in the past 12 months (n = 232) or had no pregnancy history (n = 137; controls), was recruited to complete an online survey about their depressive, anxiety, OCD, and eating disorder symptoms. Postpartum women reported greater OCD-type symptoms related to concerns about both contamination and responsibility for harm (ps < .05) compared to controls. After controlling for general stress and mental health history, the association between 2019-nCOV distress and OCD-type symptoms related to concerns about contamination was stronger among postpartum compared to control women (ps < .002). For all women, 2019-nCOV distress was positively related to general anxiety symptoms, total OCD-type symptoms, and OCD-type symptoms related to concerns about responsibility for harm after controlling for general stress and mental health history (ps < .03). Data are first to suggest postpartum women may be at elevated risk for OCD-type symptoms during 2019-nCOV pandemic, and pandemic distress is associated with anxiety and OCD-type symptoms among postpartum women more so than control women.","Thompson, Katherine A; Bardone-Cone, Anna M",,,264

The long duration of pathological laboratory tests and the suspicious test results led the researchers to focus on different fields. Fast and accurate diagnoses are essential for effective interventions for COVID-19. The information obtained by using X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) images is vital in making clinical diagnoses. Therefore it is aimed to develop a machine learning method for the detection of viral epidemics by analyzing X-ray and CT images. In this study, images belonging to six situations, including coronavirus images, are classified using a two-stage data enhancement approach. Since the number of images in the dataset is deficient and unbalanced, a shallow image augmentation approach was used in the first phase. It is more convenient to analyze these images with hand-crafted feature extraction methods because the dataset newly created is still insufficient to train a deep architecture. Therefore, the Synthetic minority over-sampling technique algorithm is the second data enhancement step of this study. Finally, the feature vector is reduced in size by using a stacked auto-encoder and principal component analysis methods to remove interconnected features in the feature vector. According to the obtained results, it is seen that the proposed method has leveraging performance, especially to make the diagnosis of COVID-19 in a short time and effectively. Also, it is thought to be a source of inspiration for future studies for deficient and unbalanced datasets.","Öztürk, Saban; Özkaya, Umut; Barstugan, Mücahid",,,264

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impacts of social isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with dementia and their family caregivers. METHODS: Two semi-structured questionnaires were applied via telephone to family caregivers of people diagnosed with dementia in three cities in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, in order to assess clinical and behavioral changes in people with dementia and in their caregivers. RESULTS: In general, 321 interviews were conducted. A significant decline in memory function has been reported among 53.0%of people with dementia. In addition, 31.2%of individuals with dementia felt sadder and 37.4%had increased anxiety symptoms. These symptoms of anxiety were greater in individuals with mild to moderate dementia, while symptoms of agitation were greater in individuals with severe dementia. Moreover, compulsive-obsessive behavior, hallucinations, increased forgetfulness, altered appetite, and increased difficulty in activities of daily living were reported more frequently among individuals with moderate to severe dementia. Caregivers reported feeling more tired and overwhelmed during this period and these symptoms were also influenced by the severity of dementia.

335879,Patients laboratory testing optimization in infectious hospital under the pandemia of the new coronavirus infection COVID-19,2020,"A mathematical model of COVID-19 with minimal compartments is developed. The model is simple enough to fit data on confirmed cases, estimate the hidden infection figure and incorporate the effect of vaccination. With the effect of the new variant being considered, the model fits well with Philippine data of confirmed cases. With the fitted parameters, results show that a second peak, strikingly similar in magnitude to the first, is to be expected if the current transmission rate is increased by about 5\% and already a complete disaster if it will go up to 20\%. The model is then used to estimate time to achieve herd immunity considering natural immunity from being infected and vaccination plan of the country. Results show that if the plan of 200,000 vaccinated people per day is achieved then herd immunity can be attained by March 2022. But if only half of that is achieved the time could go up to February 2023.","Caga-anan, Randy L.; Raza, Michelle N.; Labrador, Grace Shelda G.; Metillo, Ephrime B.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.02787v1.pdf,264

340407,First manifestation of adult-onset Still's disease after COVID-19,2021,"Elsa Joubert?s 1978 novel Die swerfjare van Poppie Nongena, translated into English and a number of other languages and adapted into a play and a film, is recognized as one of the 100 best African books of the twentieth century, a landmark in South African writing. The work and its reception have drawn heated criticism around the politics of race, gender, privilege, and voice. Critics have expressed discomfort at the popularity of the book with white readers during apartheid, when other books dealing so clearly with racial oppression and dispossession were vilified and even banned.In 2017, at the age of 95, Joubert published the third volume of her memoirs under the title Spertyd (later translated into English as Cul-de-sac). I suggest that this memoir fits into the categories both of the ?Somebody memoir? and the ?Some body memoir?, in the typology developed by G. T. Couser. Cul-de-sac is both the memoir of a famous person (a ?somebody?) and an account of a life lived in a non-normative body, that of a very old and increasingly frail person. Cul-de-sac deals unflinchingly with highly personal issues to do with experiences related to incarceration and enfeeblement. I suggest that these issues, though personal, are also profoundly political, an issue which has been overlooked in the critical reception of the memoir. Furthermore, Joubert implicitly used the publication of the memoir as the basis for a platform on which to engage politically with South Africa?s leadership regarding the rights of very old people, like herself, during the Covid-19 lockdown.It is inevitable that in South Africa, issues of race and to some extent gender are predominant in discussions of the politics of writing, but to ignore the age and disability politics of Cul-de-sac is to lose an important aspect of the work?s significance.","Swartz, Leslie",The Journal of Commonwealth Literature,,264
341148,Phytotherapy for treatment of cytokine storm in COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Transmission within families and multiple spike protein mutations have been associated with the rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to: (1) describe full genome characterization of SARS-CoV-2 and correlate the sequences with epidemiological data within family clusters, and (2) conduct phylogenetic analysis of all samples from Yogyakarta and Central Java, Indonesia and other countries. METHODS: The study involved 17 patients with COVID-19, including two family clusters. We determined the full-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 using the Illumina MiSeq next-generation sequencer. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using a dataset of 142 full-genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from different regions. RESULTS: Ninety-four SNPs were detected throughout the open reading frame (ORF) of SARS-CoV-2 samples with 58% (54/94) of the nucleic acid changes resulting in amino acid mutations. About 94% (16/17) of the virus samples showed D614G on spike protein and 56% of these (9/16) showed other various amino acid mutations on this protein, including L5F, V83L, V213A, W258R, Q677H, and N811I. The virus samples from family cluster-1 (n = 3) belong to the same clade GH, in which two were collected from deceased patients, and the other from the survived patient. All samples from this family cluster revealed a combination of spike protein mutations of D614G and V213A. Virus samples from family cluster-2 (n = 3) also belonged to the clade GH and showed other spike protein mutations of L5F alongside the D614G mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first comprehensive report associating the full-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 with the epidemiological data within family clusters. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the three viruses from family cluster-1 formed a monophyletic group, whereas viruses from family cluster-2 formed a polyphyletic group indicating there is the possibility of different sources of infection. This study highlights how the same spike protein mutations among members of the same family might show different disease outcomes.","Wibawa, Hendra; Hakim, Mohamad Saifudin; Trisnawati, Ika; Khair, Riat El; Triasih, Rina; Iskandar, Kristy; Anggorowati, Nungki; Daniwijaya, Edwin Widyanto; Supriyati, Endah; Nugrahaningsih, Dwi Aris Agung; Budiono, Eko; Retnowulan, Heni; Puspadewi, Yunika; Puspitawati, Ira; Sianipar, Osman; Afandy, Dwiki; Simanjaya, Susan; Widitjiarso, William; Puspitarani, Dyah Ayu; Fahri, Fadil; Riawan, Untung; Fauzi, Aditya Rifqi; Kalim, Alvin Santoso; Ananda, Nur Rahmi; Setyati, Amalia; Setyowireni, Dwikisworo; Laksanawati, Ida Safitri; Arguni, Eggi; Nuryastuti, Titik; Wibawa, Tri",BMC Med Genomics,,264

These antigen tests have most prominently been developed using the lateral flow assay (LFA) test platform which has the benefit of administration at point-of-care, delivering quick results, lower cost, and does not require skilled personnel. However, they have gained criticism for an inferior sensitivity. In the last year, much attention has been given to creating a rapid LFA test for detection of COVID-19 antigens that can address its high limit of detection while retaining the advantages of rapid antibodyantigen interaction. In this review, a summary of these proteinprotein interactions as well as the challenges, benefits, and recent improvements to protein based LFA for detection of COVID-19 are discussed.","Mahmoudinobar, Farbod; Britton, Dustin; Montclare, Jin Kim","Protein eng., design sel.

343822,Mechanisms of thrombosis in ANCA-associated vasculitis,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic requires clinicians to explore alternatives to routine patient management. Otolaryngologists caring for children commonly depend on physical examination, laboratory data, and ambulatory surgical procedures. Limiting patient care, mindful allocation of resources, and concern for safety have challenged all aspects of our health care system. This evidence-based clinical consensus is designed to guide practitioners of pediatric otolaryngology for common scenarios during this time. DATA SOURCES: Peer-reviewed literature, published reports, institutional guidelines, and expert consensus. REVIEW METHODS: A clinical consensus on 6 common scenarios in pediatric otolaryngology developed with evidence-based strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Providers should suspend all in-person nonessential office visits and elective surgical procedures. An emphasis on medical management and caregiver education will provide reasonable approaches to many of the common outpatient concerns. Surgery for chronic otitis media, obstructive sleep apnea, and acute rhinosinusitis should occur only in response to severe complications or failure of medical regimens. The approach to the pediatric neck mass focuses on timely management for oncologic etiologies and cautious surgical intervention for abscess drainage or tissue sampling. Finally, epistaxis and otorrhea must be triaged and addressed without the usual ambulatory procedures. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Adaptation of practice patterns during this unprecedented moment for our health care system requires thoughtful planning. The strategies described allow for safe handling of common pediatric otolaryngology diagnoses. Ultimately, otolaryngologists must be stewards of our global health community while advocating for the care of individual pediatric patients.","Chorney, Stephen R; Elden, Lisa M; Giordano, Terri; Kazahaya, Ken; Rizzi, Mark D; Zur, Karen B; Dedhia, Kavita",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,264

Method: This study consists of two parts. The first part consists of working with a leader of a house of worship to formulate a decision process based on the priorities of the organization and its physical size and population. The second part involves the modeling of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus spread within a physical space to provide the leadership of the house of worship an estimate of the outcomes of deciding on various courses of action. The model is a modification of a standard virus model developed for the NetLogo programming environment. Results: The team worked with a large local church in Pennsylvania to physically reopen a worship service. Based on the questionnaire data, the congregation did not prefer the strongest form of the SARS-CoV-2 virus mitigation (mask wearing and social distancing) but favored either mask required and no social distancing or masks optional and social distancing. The team simulated conditions representative of the church and found that social distancing is the key factor to mitigate spread. Conclusion: Given the preferences of the congregation, our simulation results suggested that one of the favored options would likely yield a large number of infections (>10% in a scenario with an asymptomatic carrier). This information was provided to the leadership to guide their decision-making for the coming months as poor weather will rule out outdoor worship as a viable option.","Rothrock, Ling; Abraham, Aaron; Graf, Allison; Rodopman, Mina; Nold, Dan",,,264

During the second week of viral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome can occur and carries high mortality. Unlike most common respiratory viruses, children seem to be less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and generally develop mild disease with low mortality. However, clusters of severe shock associated with high levels of cardiac biomarkers and unusual vasoplegia requiring inotropes, vasopressors and volume loading have recently been described. Both the clinical symptoms (i.e. high and persistent fever, gastrointestinal disorders, skin rash, conjunctival injection and dry cracked lips) and the biological signs (e.g. elevated C-reactive protein/procalcitonin and high levels of ferritinaemia) mimicked Kawasaki disease. In most cases, intravenous immunoglobin therapy improved cardiac function and led to full recovery within a few days. Adjunctive steroid therapy and sometimes biotherapy (e.g. anti-interleukin 1Ra and anti-interleukin 6 monoclonal antibodies) were often necessary. Although almost all children fully recovered within a week, some of them later developed coronary artery dilation or aneurysm. Thus, a new ""multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children"" related to SARS-CoV-2 has recently been described. Similarities with Kawasaki disease and the physiopathology of this syndrome still need further exploration.","Mercier, Jean-Christophe; Ouldali, Naim; Melki, Isabelle; Basmaci, Romain; Levy, Michael; Titomanlio, Luigi; Beyler, Constance; Meinzer, Ulrich",Arch.

Here we report the synthesis of seven new C2h symmetric tetrapodal SCRs. The structures of these SCRs possess a conserved biaryl core, and they vary in the four heterocyclic binding groups that are linked to the biaryl core via secondary amines. Supramolecular association between these SCRs and five biologically relevant C1 -O-octyloxy glycans, &#945;/ß-glucoside (&#945;/ß-Glc), &#945;/ß-mannoside (&#945;/ß-Man), and ß-galactoside (ß-Gal), was studied by mass spectrometry, 1 Hâ NMR titrations, and molecular modeling. These studies revealed that selectivity can be achieved in these tetrapodal SCRs by varying the heterocyclic binding group. We found that SCR017 (3-pyrrole), SCR021 (3-pyridine), and SCR022 (2-phenol) bind only to ß-Glc. SCR019 (3-indole) binds only to ß-Man. SCR020 (2-pyridine) binds ß-Man and &#945;-Man with a preference to the latter. SCR018 (2-indole) binds &#945;-Man and ß-Gal with a preference to the former. The glycan guests bound within their SCR hosts in one of three supramolecular geometries: center-parallel, center-perpendicular, and off-center. Many host-guest combinations formed higher stoichiometry complexes, 2:1 glycanâ SCR or 1:2 glycanâ SCR, where the former are driven by positive allosteric cooperativity induced by glycan-glycan contacts.","Bravo, M Fernando; Palanichamy, Kalanidhi; Shlain, Milan A; Schiro, Frank; Naeem, Yasir; Marianski, Mateusz; Braunschweig, Adam B",Chemistry,,264

351478,Implications of COVID-19 on time-sensitive STEMI care: A report from a North American epicenter,2020,"This paper introduces the model of Utilitarian Principlism as a framework for crisis healthcare ethics. In modern Western medicine, during non-crisis times, principlism provides the four guiding principles in biomedical ethics-autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice; autonomy typically emerges as the decisive principle. The physician-patient relationship is a deontological construct in which the physician's primary duty is to the individual patient and the individual patient is paramount. For this reason, we term the non-crisis ethical framework that guides modern medicine Deontological Principlism. During times of crisis, resources become scarce, standards of care become dynamic, and public health ethics move to the forefront. Healthcare providers are forced to work in non-ideal conditions, and interactions with individual patients must be considered in the context of the crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced healthcare to shift to a more utilitarian framework with a greater focus on promoting the health of communities and populations. This paper puts forth the notion of Utilitarian Principlism as a framework for crisis healthcare ethics.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a combined modified Constrained Induced Movement Therapy (mCIMT) program using telehealth and in-person sessions, for participants with higher (Group 1) and lower (Group 2) functional ability of the hemiparetic upper extremity. Using a pre-experimental design with a 6-week intervention, 28 participants were assessed twice on use of upper extremity via subjective and objective measures. For the Motor Activity Log, the amount of use and quality of use were significant for Groups 1 and 2. Significant improvements were shown on the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), the Fugl-Meyer UE, and the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) for both groups except for the strength subtest on the WMFT and the timed portion for Group 1. Percentages of attendance for telehealth and in-person sessions were also compared. Telehealth sessions had a higher attendance rate (84.5%) than in-person sessions (75.3%) (p=.004). The combined mCIMT program of telerehabilitation and in-person group sessions was effective in improving functional ability after a stroke.","Smith, Mary Ann; Tomita, Machiko R",Int J Telerehabil,,264

China, as the first country to fight the epidemic, took measures such as social isolation, regional blockade, and traffic control, which had a positive effect on preventing the spread of the epidemic, but the agricultural supply chain in the control area received a great impact;in terms of international epidemic prevention, all countries are strengthening their border blockade, safeguarding their own food demand, and strict import and export quarantine measures [1], which has a huge impact on the global flow of agricultural products, and the lack of imported agricultural products to supplement the supply security of China's agricultural products is under certain threat. In this paper, by sorting out the paths of the epidemic affecting the supply chain of agricultural products and the characteristics of China's agricultural supply chain, we deeply analyze the sources of risks in China's agricultural supply chain under the epidemic, and put forward suggestions such as strengthening the collaborative management of the agricultural supply chain, building a response mechanism and prevention mechanism for the quality and safety of agricultural products, constructing a logistics network suitable for the storage and transportation requirements of agricultural products, and accelerating the construction of a big data platform for the agricultural supply chain. © 2021 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.","Zeng, S.","5th International Workshop on Advances in Energy Science and Environment Engineering, AESEE 2021",,264

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Hospital Clinico San Carlos of Madrid, Spain. A total of 301 subjects from the COVID admission unit with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. The presence and clinical characteristics of conjunctivitis were evaluated. Laboratory, radiological, and clinical results in patients with and without conjunctivitis stratified by sex were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 301 subjects included, 180 patients (59.8%) were male and the median age was 72 years (IQ 59-82). Overall, 35 patients (11.6%) were diagnosed with acute conjunctivitis. We found no relationship between the COVID-19 severity score and the presence of conjunctivitis (P = 0.17). However, conjunctivitis was more frequent in males with moderate clinical severity and in women classified as clinically mild. The natural history of the disease seems to be a rapid self-limited conjunctivitis that improves without treatment and does not affect visual acuity nor associate short-term complications. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately, 1 out of 10 hospitalized non-critical COVID-19 patients presents conjunctivitis during the disease. Compared with other viral conjunctivitis, we found distinctive clinical findings that could guide defining and differentiating conjunctivitis in COVID-19 patients.

360455,"Estimates of gene ensemble noise highlight critical pathways and predict disease severity in H1N1, COVID-19 and mortality in sepsis patients",2021,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute infectious disease caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Currently, the World Health Organization has confirmed that COVID-19 is a global infectious disease pandemic. This is the third acute infectious disease caused by coronavirus infection in this century, after sudden acute respirator syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome. The damage mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is still unclear. It is possible that protein S binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors and invades alveolar epithelial cells, causing direct toxic effects and an excessive immune response. This stimulates a systemic inflammatory response, thus forming a cytokine storm, which leads to lung tissue injury. In severe cases, the disease can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. Patients with severe COVID-19 have a relatively high mortality rate. Currently, there are no specific antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. Most patients need to be admitted to the intensive care unit for intensive monitoring and supportive organ function treatments. This article reviews the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment methods of severe COVID-19 and puts forward some tentative ideas, aiming to provide some guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of severe COVID-19.","Xie, Peng; Ma, Wanyu; Tang, Hongbo; Liu, Daishun",Front.

In this study, we aimed to explore the risk of maternal-fetal transmission before 24 weeks of gestation, through analysis of abortion materials collected from PCR-positive women with pregnancy loss. To the best of our knowledge, apart from case reports, this study is the first prospective work on the vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in early pregnancy. METHODS: The patients who had attended our clinic with the diagnosis of pregnancy loss before 24 weeks of gestation were screened for COVID-19. Vertical transmission in PCR-positive women was assessed through the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fetal-placental tissues by rt-PCR test. RESULTS: 24 of 210 (%11,4) pregnant women participating in the study had positive rt-PCR results. Placenta and curettage material samples of these PCR-positive patients were analyzed and all valid test results (21 samples) were negative for SARS CoV-2 RNA. In three cases, the rt-PCR results were invalid due to failed internal controls. DISCUSSION: In the literature, the possibility of intrauterine vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is still controversial. The findings of the present study did not reveal any evidence of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in early pregnancy.","Halici-Ozturk, Filiz; Ocal, Fatma Doga; Aydin, Selvi; Tanacan, Atakan; Ayhan, Sule Göncü; Altinboga, Orhan; Dinc, Bedia; Moraloglu, Özlem Tekin; Sahin, Dilek",Placenta,,264

This study aimed to investigate whether environmental contamination may play a role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. METHODS: Air samples were collected by natural precipitation, and environmental surface samples were collected by conventional surface swabbing. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was performed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Viral RNA was not detected in the 44 air samples. The positive rates in 200 environmental surface samples in medical areas (24.83%) was higher than that in living quarters (3.64%), with a significant difference (P < .05). The positive rates were 25.00% and 37.50% for the general isolation ward and intensive care unit, respectively, and no significant difference was observed between them (Pâ¯=â¯.238). The top 5 sampling sites with a positive rate in medical areas were beepers (50.00%), water machine buttons (50.00%), elevator buttons (42.86%), computer mouses (40.00%), and telephones (40.00%). CONCLUSIONS: Most of the touchable surfaces in the designated hospital for COVID-19 were heavily contaminated, suggesting that the environment is a potential medium of disease transmission. These results emphasize the need for strict environmental surface hygiene practices and enhanced hand hygiene to prevent the spread of the virus.","Wu, Songjie; Wang, Ying; Jin, Xuelan; Tian, Jia; Liu, Jianzhong; Mao, Yiping",Am J Infect Control,,264

One of the methods of detecting these types of changes in COVID-19 patients is an electroencephalogram (EEG) test, which allows information to be obtained about the functioning of the brain as well as diagnosing diseases and predicting their consequences. The aim of the study was to review the latest research on changes in EEG in patients with COVID-19 as a basis for further quantitative electroencephalogram (QEEG) diagnostics and EEG neurofeedback training. Description of the state of knowledge: Based on the available scientific literature using the PubMed database from 2020 and early 2021 regarding changes in the EEG records in patients with COVID-19, 17 publications were included in the analysis. In patients who underwent an EEG test, changes in the frontal area were observed. A few patients were not found to be responsive to external stimuli. Additionally, a previously non-emerging, uncommon pattern in the form of continuous, slightly asymmetric, monomorphic, biphasic and slow delta waves occurred. CONCLUSION: The results of this analysis clearly indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 virus causes changes in the nervous system that can be manifested and detected in the EEG record. The small number of available articles, the small number of research groups and the lack of control groups suggest the need for further research regarding the short and long term neurological effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the need for unquestionable confirmation that observed changes were caused by the virus per se and did not occur before.

Surprisingly, many stocks of the closely related SIVmac251 swarm virus harbor a nef allele encoding a Q196. In SIVmac239, this variant is associated with loss of multiple AP-2 dependent functions. Publicly available sequences for SIVmac251 stocks were mined for variants linked to Q196 that might compensate for functional defects associated with this residue. Variants were engineered into the SIVmac239 backbone and in Nef expression plasmids and flow cytometry was used to examine surface tetherin expression in primary CD4 T cells and surface CD4 expression in SupT1 cells engineered to express rhesus CD4. We found that SIVmac251 stocks that encode a Q196 residue in Nef uniformly also encode an upstream R191 residue. We show that R191 restores the ability of Nef to downregulate tetherin in the presence of Q196 and has a similar but less pronounced impact on CD4 expression. However, a published report showed Q196 commonly evolves to H196 in vivo, suggesting a fitness cost. R191 may represent compensatory evolution to restore the ability to downregulate tetherin lost in viruses harboring Q196.","Schouest, Blake; Leslie, George J; Hoxie, James A; Maness, Nicholas J",PLoS One,,264

METHODS: We acquired information and data on general information on and infection and death status of HCWs in Wuhan during the COVID-19 outbreak and completed statistical analyses. RESULTS: We obtained the data on 2457 infected cases among HCWs in Wuhan, China. More than half of the infected individuals were nurses (52.06%), whereas 33.62% of infected cases were doctors and 14.33% of cases were medical staff. In particular, the case infection rate of nurses (2.22%) was remarkably higher than that of doctors (1.92%). Most infected cases among HCWs were female (72.28%). A majority of the infected HCWs (89.26%) came from general hospitals, followed by specialized hospitals (5.70%) and community hospitals (5.05%). The case infection rate of HCWs (2.10%) was dramatically higher than that of non-HCWs (0.43%). The case fatality rate of HCWs (0.69%) was significantly lower than that of non-HCWs (5.30%). CONCLUSIONS: The infection risk of HCWs is clearly higher than that of non-HCWs. HCWs play an essential role in fighting the pandemic. The analysis of the infection status of HCWs is essential to attract enough attention from the public, provide effective suggestions for government agencies, and improve protective measures for HCWs.","Zheng, Lichun; Wang, Xiang; Zhou, Chongchong; Liu, Qin; Li, Shuang; Sun, Qin; Wang, Mengjia; Zhou, Qian; Wang, Wenmei",Clin Infect Dis,,264

365168,Treatment of the cytokine storm in covid-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 continues unabated and vaccine hesitancy is a chronic public health threat that may undermine efforts to achieve herd immunity for this pandemic by vaccination. A questionnaire was carried out in the University of Malta Faculties of Health Sciences, Dentistry and Medicine to ascertain degree of vaccine hesitancy vis-à-vis influenza and COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was sent through the faculty Deans and the respective secretaries via Google forms. RESULTS: The response rate was 23% (n = 852). The percentages of who took the influenza vaccine last year and who will take it this year increased at all ages, highest for Medicine and Academics. For COVID-19 vaccination, unlikely, undecided and likely to take were 30.5/25.3/44.2% respectively. Medicine and Academics was also likeliest to take, as were males overall. The proportion of those likelier to take the COVID-19 vaccine was directly related to likelihood of taking influenza vaccination. Concerns pertaining to COVID-19 vaccination were related to insufficient knowledge about such a vaccine and potential long-term side effects. DISCUSSION: The increased influenza vaccine uptake is unsurprising in view of the current heightened awareness of respiratory disease. The hesitancy toward COVID-19 vaccination is of concern particularly in this health related group who should be better informed. The association of vaccine hesitancy for COVID-19 with influenza vaccination infers an intrinsic degree of vaccine hesitancy. Far more must be done in order to educate not only the public but also healthcare workers and students with regard to the advantages and safety of vaccines.","Grech, Victor; Gauci, Charmaine",Early Hum Dev,,264

365572,Early liver transplantation after COVID-19 infection: The first report,2021,"In order to cope with the exponentially increasing number of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, European countries made enormous efforts to reorganize medical assistance and several diseases, including stroke, were particularly impacted. We report the experience of stroke neurologists from three European countries (Italy, France and Germany) that faced the pandemic at diverse time points and with different approaches, depending on their resources and healthcare system organization. Pre-hospital and in-hospital acute stroke pathways were reorganized to prioritize COVID-19 management and, in severely affected regions of Italy and France, stroke care was centralized to a limited number of centers, whereas the remaining stroke units were dedicated to patients with COVID-19. Access to acute stroke diagnostics and time-dependent therapies was limited or delayed because of reduced capacities of emergency services due to the burden of patients with COVID-19. A marked reduction in the number of patients presenting with transient ischaemic attack and stroke was noted in the emergency departments of all three countries. Although we only have preliminary data, these conditions may have affected stroke outcome. These indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could negate the efforts of stroke neurologists over the last few years to improve outcome and reduce mortality of stroke patients. Although the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate is slowing down in Europe, the effects of ending lockdown in the next months are unpredictable. It is important for the European and world stroke community to share what has been learned so far to be plan strategies to ensure stroke care in the future and upcoming challenging times.","Bersano, A; Kraemer, M; Touzé, E; Weber, R; Alamowitch, S; Sibon, I; Pantoni, L",Eur. j. neurol,,264

366529,COVID-19 and the pulmonary complications of sickle cell disease,2020,"The Covid-19 crisis has been truly worldwide and has unfolded almost simultaneously across the globe. In order to control its spread and alleviate its impact governments have been faced with a range of policy options in terms of containment and closure, ramping up healthcare, and mitigating its economic effects. In this paper, we explore the stringency as well as the speed of policy response as a function of leaders' personality traits, accounting for party-political orientation. To do this, we construct a text corpus composed of 26 country leaders' rhetoric on Covid-19 collected from 10 days before the first recorded death in their respective countries until 90 days after, and use a pre-trained machine classifier to generate the Big Five personality traits for each leader. We find two general patterns: (1) one around neuroticism, a trait associated with negative stress response, which is associated with leniency in containment and health policy measures;and (2) some evidence that conscientiousness, a trait associated with risk aversion, is associated with quicker policy response. We conclude by suggesting analysis on the sub-national level in order to increase test power, and more work on validation linking our estimates of Big Five to expert ratings of personality.

367637,Management of Severe Asthma During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Korea,2020,"Pain management in both outpatient and inpatient settings demands a multidisciplinary approach entailing medical, physical and psychological therapies. Among these, multimodal analgesic regimens stand out as a promising treatment options. Cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitor/opioid receptor agonist combinations hold great potential as effective pillars in the multimodal pain management by providing adequate analgesia with fewer safety risks due to COX inhibitors' opioid-sparing effect. Thus, these combinations, either freely or in fixed-dose formulation, offer a feasible option for the prescribing clinicians who seek to maximise therapeutic effect while simultaneously minimise adverse effects. The selection of the appropriate non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and opioid agent at optimal doses is essential. It should be tailored to the patients' analgesic necessities, and his/her gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risk, and potential concurrent aspirin use. Moreover, it should allow for addiction risk and the potential opioid-induced bowel dysfunction and constipation. To ensure an optimal match between the characteristics of the patient and the properties of the chosen medication, and to guide adequate and well-tolerated treatment decisions, it is of paramount importance to expand clinicians' knowledge of the currently available COX inhibitor/opioid receptor agonist combinations. This invited narrative review deals with the literature evidence covering the components of multimodal opioid-sparing analgesic regimens. Also, it provides insights into the clinically relevant choice criteria to ensure a patient-tailored analgesia.","Varrassi, Giustino; Yeam, Cheng Teng; Rekatsina, Martina; Pergolizzi, Joseph V; Zis, Panagiotis; Paladini, Antonella",Drugs,,264

369292,COVID-19 infection in patients with multiple myeloma: a German-Chinese experience from Würzburg and Wuhan,2020,"BACKGROUND: Several vaccines are now clinically available under emergency use authorization in the United States and have demonstrated efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19. The impact of vaccines on asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is largely unknown. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive, asymptomatic adult patients (n = 39,156) within a large United States healthcare system who underwent 48,333 pre-procedural SARS-CoV-2 molecular screening tests between December 17, 2020 and February 8, 2021. The primary exposure of interest was vaccination with at least one dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. The primary outcome was relative risk of a positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular test among those asymptomatic persons who had received at least one dose of vaccine, as compared to persons who had not received vaccine during the same time period. Relative risk was adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, patient residence relative to the hospital (local vs. non-local), healthcare system regions, and repeated screenings among patients using mixed effects log-binomial regression. RESULTS: Positive molecular tests in asymptomatic individuals were reported in 42 (1.4%) of 3,006 tests performed on vaccinated patients and 1,436 (3.2%) of 45,327 tests performed on unvaccinated patients (RR=0.44 95% CI: 0.33-0.60; p<.0001). Compared to unvaccinated patients, the risk of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was lower among those >10 days after 1 st dose (RR=0.21; 95% CI: 0.12-0.37; p<.0001) and >0 days after 2 nd dose (RR=0.20; 95% CI: 0.09-0.44; p<.0001) in the adjusted analysis. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccination with an mRNA-based vaccine showed a significant association with a reduced risk of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection as measured during pre-procedural molecular screening. The results of this study demonstrate the impact of the vaccines on reduction in asymptomatic infections supplementing the randomized trial results on symptomatic patients.","Tande, Aaron J; Pollock, Benjamin D; Shah, Nilay D; Farrugia, Gianrico; Virk, Abinash; Swift, Melanie; Breeher, Laura; Binnicker, Matthew; Berbari, Elie F",Clin. infect. dis,,264

Transplant centers have initiated SOT despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Although it is suggested to wait for 4 weeks after COVID-19 infection, there are no data to support or refute the timing of liver transplant after COVID-19 infection. Here we describe the course and outcomes of COVID-19-infected candidates and healthy living liver donors who underwent transplantation. A total of 38 candidates and 33 potential living donors were evaluated from May 20, 2020 until October 30, 2020. Ten candidates and five donors were reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pretransplant. Four candidates succumbed preoperatively. Given the worsening of liver disease, four candidates underwent liver transplant after 2 weeks due to the worsening of liver disease and the other two candidates after 4 weeks. Only one recipient died due to sepsis posttransplant. Three donors underwent successful liver donation surgery after 4 weeks of COVID-19 infection without any postoperative complications, and the other two were delisted (as the candidates expired).

369842,Myocardial injury in COVID-19: The role of coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA),2020,"The unscented transform uses a weighted set of samples called sigma points to propagate the means and covariances of nonlinear transformations of random variables. However, unscented transforms developed using either the Gaussian assumption or a minimum set of sigma points typically fall short when the random variable is not Gaussian distributed and the nonlinearities are substantial. In this paper, we develop the generalized unscented transform (GenUT), which uses adaptable sigma points that can be positively constrained, and accurately approximates the mean, covariance, and skewness of an independent random vector of most probability distributions, while being able to partially approximate the kurtosis. For correlated random vectors, the GenUT can accurately approximate the mean and covariance. In addition to its superior accuracy in propagating means and covariances, the GenUT uses the same order of calculations as most unscented transforms that guarantee third-order accuracy, which makes it applicable to a wide variety of applications, including the assimilation of observations in the modeling of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19.","Ebeigbe, Donald; Berry, Tyrus; Norton, Michael M.; Whalen, Andrew J.; Simon, Dan; Sauer, Timothy; Schiff, Steven J.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.01958v1.pdf,264

371448,Management of hospitalized patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and COVID-19 infection,2020,"'Bentong' ginger is the most popular variety of Zingiber officinale in Malaysia. It is vegetatively propagated and requires a high proportion of rhizomes as starting planting materials. Besides, ginger vegetative propagation using its rhizomes is accompanied by several types of soil-borne diseases. Plant tissue culture techniques have been applied in many plant species to produce their disease-free planting materials. As 'Bentong' ginger is less known for its micropropagation, this study was conducted to investigate the effects of Clorox (5.25% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl)) on explant surface sterilization, effects of plant growth regulators, and basal media on shoots' multiplication and rooting. The secondary metabolites and antioxidant activities of the micropropagated plants were evaluated in comparison with conventionally propagated plants. Rhizome sprouted buds were effectively sterilized in 70% Clorox for 30 min by obtaining 75% contamination-free explants. Murashige and Skoog (MS) supplemented with 10 µM of zeatin was the suitable medium for shoot multiplication, which resulted in the highest number of shoots per explant (4.28). MS medium supplemented with 7.5 µM 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) resulted in the highest number of roots per plantlet. The in vitro-rooted plantlets were successfully acclimatized with a 95% survival rate in the ex vitro conditions. The phytochemical analysis showed that total phenolic acid and total flavonoid content and antioxidant activities of the micropropagated plants were not significantly different from the conventionally propagated plants of 'Bentong' ginger. In conclusion, the present study's outcome can be adopted for large-scale propagation of disease-free planting materials of 'Bentong' ginger.","Zahid, Nisar Ahmad; Jaafar, Hawa Z E; Hakiman, Mansor",,,264
371606,COVID-19 in hemodialysis patients,2021,"BACKGROUND: The global impact of COVID-19 and the country-specific responses to the pandemic provide an unparalleled opportunity to learn about different patterns of the outbreak and interventions. We model the global pattern of reported COVID-19 cases during the primary response period, with the aim of learning from the past to prepare for the future. METHODS: Using Bayesian methods, we analyse the response to the COVID-19 outbreak for 158 countries for the period 22 January to 9 June 2020. This encompasses the period in which many countries imposed a variety of response measures and initial relaxation strategies. Instead of modelling specific intervention types and timings for each country explicitly, we adopt a stochastic epidemiological model including a feedback mechanism on virus transmission to capture complex nonlinear dynamics arising from continuous changes in community behaviour in response to rising case numbers. We analyse the overall effect of interventions and community responses across diverse regions. This approach mitigates explicit consideration of issues such as period of infectivity and public adherence to government restrictions. RESULTS: Countries with the largest cumulative case tallies are characterised by a delayed response, whereas countries that avoid substantial community transmission during the period of study responded quickly. Countries that recovered rapidly also have a higher case identification rate and small numbers of undocumented community transmission at the early stages of the outbreak. We also demonstrate that uncertainty in numbers of undocumented infections dramatically impacts the risk of multiple waves. Our approach is also effective at pre-empting potential flare-ups. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the utility of modelling to interpret community behaviour in the early epidemic stages. Two lessons learnt that are important for the future are: i) countries that imposed strict containment measures early in the epidemic fared better with respect to numbers of reported cases; and ii) broader testing is required early in the epidemic to understand the magnitude of undocumented infections and recover rapidly. We conclude that clear patterns of containment are essential prior to relaxation of restrictions and show that modelling can provide insights to this end.","Warne, David J; Ebert, Anthony; Drovandi, Christopher; Hu, Wenbiao; Mira, Antonietta; Mengersen, Kerrie",BMC Public Health,,264
371607,COVID-19 in hemodialysis patients,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an unprecedented global public health challenge. In the United States (US), state governments have implemented various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as physical distance closure (lockdown), stay-at-home order, mandatory facial mask in public in response to the rapid spread of COVID-19. To evaluate the effectiveness of these NPIs, we propose a nested case-control design with propensity score weighting under the quasi-experiment framework to estimate the average intervention effect on disease transmission across states. We further develop a method to test for factors that moderate intervention effect to assist precision public health intervention. Our method takes account of the underlying dynamics of disease transmission and balance state-level pre-intervention characteristics. We prove that our estimator provides causal intervention effect under assumptions. We apply this method to analyze US COVID-19 incidence cases to estimate the effects of six interventions. We show that lockdown has the largest effect on reducing transmission and reopening bars significantly increase transmission. States with a higher percentage of non-white population are at greater risk of increased $R_t$ associated with reopening bars.","Xie, S.; Wang, W.; Wang, Q.; Wang, Y.; Zeng, D.",,,264

METHODS: One hundred and eighty-five patients (87 men, 98 women; mean age, 48.7 years), who underwent RT-PCR sampling and high-resolution CT examination in our hospital between March 15, 2020, and April 15, 2020, and got a definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 disease via initial or follow-up RT-PCR test, were included in the study. We comprehensively analyzed the most common and relatively rare CT imaging features (e.g., distribution pattern, density of the lesions, additional CT signs) in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients (20.6%) had no evidence of pneumonia on their initial high-resolution CT images. Among 147 patients (79.4%) who had parenchymal infiltration consistent with pneumonia, 10 (6.8%) had a negative baseline RT-PCR test, and positivity was detected as a result of repeated tests. Most of the patients had multifocal (89.1%) and bilateral (86.4%) lesions. The most common location, right lower lobe, was affected in 87.8% of the patients. Lesions were distributed predominantly at peripheral (87.1%) and posterior (46.3%) areas of lung parenchyma. Most of the patients had pure ground glass opacity (GGO) (82.3%) followed by GGO with consolidation (32.7%) and crazy paving pattern (21.8%). Pure consolidation, solid nodules, halo sign, reverse halo sign, vascular enlargement, subpleural line, air-bronchogram, and bronchiectasis were the other findings observed in at least 15% of the cases. Halo sign, acinar nodules, air-bubble sign, pleural thickening and effusion, mediastinal and/or hilar lymphadenopathy were seen rarely (2%-12.9%). Pericardial effusion, pneumothorax, cavitation, and tree-in-bud pattern were not detected in our study group.

It aims to increase knowledge and awareness about the moral relevance of the outbreak, especially as regards the balance of equity and dignity in clinical practice and patient's care. METHOD: According to the argument-based review framework, we started our research from the following two questions: what are the ethical principles adopted by the ethical guidelines produced at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak related to resource allocation? And what are the practical consequences in terms of 'priority' of access, access criteria, management of the decision-making process and patient care? RESULTS: Twenty-two ethical guidelines met our inclusion criteria and the results of our analysis are organized into 4 ethical concepts and related arguments: the equity principle and emerging ethical theories; triage criteria; respecting patient's dignity, and decision making and quality of care. CONCLUSION: Further studies can investigate the practical consequences of the application of the guidelines described, in terms of quality of care and health care professionals' moral distress.","Perin, Marta; De Panfilis, Ludovica",BMC Med Ethics,,264

375798,Diagnosis and treatment of acute surgical diseases in patients with Covid-19,2020,"Objective When COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic, collegiate athletic departments faced the difficult decision to postpone or cancel sport activities. Aside from concerns of virus transmission, disruptions in sport impacted student-athletes broadly. This study aimed to investigate athletes' experiences during the pandemic toward developing a better understanding of athletes' attitudes about the virus and returning to sport. Methods Participants included 245 varsity student-athletes across NCAA sports and divisions who voluntarily completed an online survey between August and October 2020. Results A positive COVID-19 result during the pandemic was reported by 1 in 4 athletes. Mental health, cancelled seasons, and academic progress were rated the top three COVID-related concerns. Declines in physical fitness were reported by 50% of participants and change in weight was reported by 45%. While agreement that their athletic department was taking COVID-19 seriously was endorsed by 78% of athletes, 26% believed the proposed safety procedures lacked feasibility. Concern about speaking up if the procedures were not followed was endorsed by 79% of athletes. Of the participants, 88% agreed that they have a social responsibility to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Only 44% worried about being exposed to the virus during sport participation. Comfort returning to sport immediately was endorsed by 70% of student-athletes. Just over half said they would get vaccinated if the vaccine became available. Conclusions Student-athletes have been affected by the pandemic in several ways. It is evident that athletes are concerned about the pandemic's impact on mental and physical health and are eager to return to sport.

375937,Management of Immunosuppression During Severe COVID-19 Infection in a Patient With Pulmonary and Cardiac Sarcoidosis,2020,"R.E. Kavetsky Institute of Experimental Pathology, Oncology and Radiobiology of the National Academy of Science of Ukraine has been studying the mechanisms and specificities of individual radiation sensitivity (IRS) formation in professionals who work in the field of ionizing radiation, cancer patients and representatives of other population groups. Our data based on the use of G2-test in in vitro irradiated blood lymphocytes in late G2-period of cell cycle indicated an increased carcinogenic risk in professionals with high IRS. We suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic could make significant adjustments in the formation of IRS in professionals who have survived the disease and continue to work with ionizing radiation (IR). Increased systemic inflammatory activity, which persists for a long time in COVID-19 patients, in combination with low-dose range irradiation (professionals who continue to work with IR) and with local irradiation in the high-dose range (radiation therapy for cancer patients) may affect IRS. Repeated determination of IRS in professionals who have had COVID-19 infection, using chromosomal G2-radiation sensitivity assay will answer the question: can SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus affect the IRS? The proposed hypothesis of the radiosensitivity evolution needs further experimental validation using a set of radiobiological indices to clarify the mechanism of IRS formation following COVID-19 infection. The detected changes (increase) of human IRS after COVID-19 must be taken into account for personalized planning of radiotherapy of COVID-19 cancer patients.","Chekhun, V. F.; Domina, E.

377265,Cutting Edge: Distinct B Cell Repertoires Characterize Patients with Mild and Severe COVID-19,2021,"The ability of the human adaptive immune system to respond to antigens relies upon the tremendous diversity of T cell receptors (TCR) and B cell receptors (BCR). The entirety of an individual's BCRs, often referred to as an antibody repertoire, shapes the humoral immune system. Therefore, technologies to identify and characterize antibody repertoires are critical for understanding fundamental aspects of the development and maintenance of the humoral immune system. Recently, innovative methodologies and technologies devoted to high-throughput sequencing of antibody repertoires (Ig-Seq) have broadened the understanding of humoral immunity. This review provides an overview of the Ig-Seq pipeline from sample collection, library preparation, and sequencing, to data cleaning, sequence alignment, and high-level processing. Conventional and current strategies used in Ig-Seq are introduced in detail, including bulk BCR sequencing, heavy and light chain paired sequencing combined with proteomic or single B cell sequencing approaches, antigen-specific single B cell sequencing, and single-molecule sequencing. Applications of Ig-Seq are also discussed, including antibody diversity measurement, signatures associated with different populations, novel findings involved in the antibody repertoire development, and strategies of functional antibody discovery from antibody repertoires. Finally, the pitfalls and opportunities in the deep mining of antibody repertoires are discussed.","Tian, Xiaolong; Li, Cheng; Wu, Yanling; Ying, Tianlei",Small Methods,,264

In countries such as Nigeria, mobile positioning data significantly improved decision making, capacity and scope of contact tracing and surveillance of known contacts of confirmed cases. We noted that collaborations between the government, mobile network operators and technology companies were utilised for successful mobile positioning data tracing interventions for COVID patients.

We report on an autoethnographic account of an entrepreneurship professor and several colleagues who gave themselves permission to hustle to overcome perceived institutional barriers to entrepreneurial action. As the findings reveal, a permission to hustle mindset provided a platform for the group of professors to act entrepreneurially in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In a matter of several days, the group acted under uncertainty to create a new “idea blitz” program which attracted over 150 participants from around the world. We argue that permission to hustle is an important sense-breaking device that ignites and sustains entrepreneurial action by breaking taken-for-granted assumptions about institutionalized practices and redirecting attention toward urgent and creative action, especially in existing organizations where institutional barriers are perceived to impede such action.","Fisher, Greg; Stevenson, Regan; Burnell, Devin",J.

388938,Influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on treatment times for acute ischemic stroke,2020,"The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has recently caused a large-scale outbreak of viral pneumonia both in China and worldwide. In this study, we obtained the entire genome sequence of 777 new coronavirus strains as of 29 February 2020 from a public gene bank. Bioinformatics analysis of these strains indicated that the mutation rate of these new coronaviruses is not high at present, similar to the mutation rate of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus. The similarities of 2019-nCoV and SARS virus suggested that the S and ORF6 proteins shared a low similarity, while the E protein shared the higher similarity. The 2019-nCoV sequence has similar potential phosphorylation sites and glycosylation sites on the surface protein and the ORF1ab polyprotein as the SARS virus; however, there are differences in potential modification sites between the Chinese strain and some American strains. At the same time, we proposed two possible recombination sites for 2019-nCoV. Based on the results of the skyline, we speculate that the activity of the gene population of 2019-nCoV may be before the end of 2019. As the scope of the 2019-nCoV infection further expands, it may produce different adaptive evolutions due to different environments. Finally, evolutionary genetic analysis can be a useful resource for studying the spread and virulence of 2019-nCoV, which are essential aspects of preventive and precise medicine.","Shao, Tong; Wang, Wenfang; Duan, Meiyu; Pan, Jiahui; Xin, Zhuoyuan; Liu, Baoyue; Zhou, Fengfeng; Wang, Guoqing",Brief. bioinform,,264

Proponents argue that the low cost and near perfect safety profile of vitamin C support its early adoption. Yet, adverse events might be underreported and underappreciated. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 73-year-old non-diabetic white man with end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis admitted to the intensive care unit with septic shock that was suspected to be due to peritonitis. The patient was enrolled in LOVIT (Lessening Organ Dysfunction with VITamin C; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03680274), a randomized placebo-controlled trial of high-dose intravenous vitamin C. He developed factitious hyperglycemia, as measured with a point-of-care glucometer, that persisted for 6 days after discontinuation of the study drug, confirmed to be vitamin C after unblinding. He also had short-lived iatrogenic coma because of hypoglycemia secondary to insulin administration. These events triggered a protocol amendment. CONCLUSIONS: Although factitious hyperglycemia has been reported before using certain glucometers in patients treated with high-dose vitamin C, the persistence of this phenomenon for 6 days after the discontinuation of the therapy is a distinguishing feature. This case highlights the importance of monitoring glucose with a core laboratory assay for up to a week in specific populations, such as patients on peritoneal dialysis.","Lachance, Olivier; Goyer, François; Adhikari, Neill K J; Masse, Marie-Hélène; Bilodeau, Jean-François; Lamontagne, François; Leclair, Marc-André",J Med Case Rep,,264

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 716,319 one-year survivors of prostate cancer diagnosed at ages 35-84 during 2000-2015 as reported to 17 US Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registries. METHODS: We estimated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for second primary non-prostate malignancies by race/ethnicity (non-Latino white, Black, Asian/Pacific Islander [API] and Latino), by Gleason, and by time since prostate cancer diagnosis. Poisson regression models were used to test heterogeneity between groups with the expected number as the offset. RESULTS: 60,707 second primary malignancies were observed. SIRs for all second cancers combined varied significantly by race/ethnicity: SIRwhite: 0.88 (95% confidence interval: 0.87-0.89), SIRLatino: 0.92 (0.89-0.95), SIRBlack: 0.97 (0.95-0.99), and SIRAPI: 1.05 (1.01-1.09) (p-heterogeneity < 0.001). SIRs for all cancers combined were higher among survivors of higher vs. lower Gleason prostate cancers irrespective of race/ethnicity. We observed significant heterogeneity by race/ethnicity in SIRs for 9 of 14 second cancer types investigated including lung, bladder, kidney, and liver. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that most prostate cancer survivors have lower risks of second cancers than expected, but the magnitude varied by race/ethnicity. Exceptionally, API men had small but significantly increased risk. Further research to understand drivers of the observed race/ethnicity heterogeneity is warranted.","Withrow, Diana R; Schonfeld, Sara J; Curtis, Rochelle E; Morton, Lindsay M; Cook, Michael B; Butler, Eboneé N; Berrington de González, Amy",Cancer causes control,,264

He estimates the crop will fetch him roughly 10,000 Kenyan shillings—a little over US $93—every week for nearly three months.• This year's tomato harvest alone will nearly pay for the technology that's underpinning Gicheru's success: a solar-powered water pump. A model of simplicity, it consists of a 310-watt photovoltaic panel, a 440-watt-hour lithium-ion battery pack, and a controller that supports his 3,000-liter-per-hour direct-current pump as well as a few LED lights, a mobile phone charger, and a flat-screen TV.• In February 2020, when I visited Gicheru, the small farmer had zero control over the COVID-19 pandemic that was spreading toward Kenya, or the historic locust invasion devouring fields throughout East Africa. But the solar pump he acquired in 2019 was tapping a stable supply of groundwater, boosting his yields and growing seasons, and neutralizing the waves of drought that have afflicted sub-Saharan Africa since time immemorial. • Before acquiring his solar system, Gicheru—like the vast majority of Kenya's small farmers—relied exclusively on rainfall. He also raised cattle back then and lost many to dry spells. He describes life with solar-powered irrigation as a new era: “It has really transformed our lives. At the end of the day, I can be able to put food on the table. I'm also employing people, so I can help them put food on the table. So I thank God. I'm happy.”","Fairley, Peter",IEEE Spectrum,,264

Video recordings of theatre performances are archival documents and mediated ‘performance texts’ that enable new kinds of performance analysis and studying bodily practices. This paper addresses annotative methodologies as part of the research project, ‘The Art of Adaptation: The Theatre of Rina Yerushalmi and the Itim Ensemble.’ The project studies the video archive of the ensemble, which includes recordings of full productions and rehearsal processes. We discuss three kinds of digital comparative annotative methodologies to show how annotation can be used as a research tool for performance analysis: (1) Accumulative annotation: analysis of multi-layered theatrical sequences, revealing theatrical moments in their multiplicity. (2) Annotation of different scenes in a corpus of works: juxtaposing scenes from different productions enables the articulation of repetitive performative patterns, embodied practices, and visual images that construct a theatre language. (3) Annotation of the same scene at different phases: juxtaposing video recordings of the same scene at different moments of its development reveals nuanced sets of information about directorial choices, acting, movement, duration, and more. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Aronson-Lehavi, S.; Skop, N.; Via Dorembus, Y.",International Journal of Performance Arts and Digital Media,,264

A chest CT scoring system, ÖCoS, was implemented in clinical routine on 1 April 2020, in Örebro Region, Sweden. The ÖCoS-severity score measures the extent of lung involvement. The objective of the study was to evaluate the ÖCoS scores as predictors of the clinical course of Covid-19. METHODS: Population based study including data from all hospitalized patients with Covid-19 in Örebro Region during March to July 2020. We evaluated the correlations between CT scores at the time of admission to hospital and intensive care in relation to hospital and intensive care length of stay (LoS), intensive care admission and death. C-reactive protein and lymphocyte count were included as covariates in multivariate regression analyses. RESULTS: In 381 included patients, the ÖCoS-severity score at admission closely correlated to hospital length of stay, and intensive care admission or death. At admission to intensive care, the ÖCoS-severity score correlated with intensive care length of stay. The ÖCoS-severity score was superior to basic inflammatory biomarkers in predicting clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION: Chest CT visual scoring at admission to hospital predicted the clinical course of Covid-19 pneumonia.","Ahlstrand, Erik; Cajander, Sara; Cajander, Per; Ingberg, Edvin; Löf, Erika; Wegener, Matthias; Lidén, Mats",Infect Dis (Lond),,264

OBJECTIVES: We conducted a systematic review to examine the interorganizational care coordination initiatives that Veterans Affairs (VA) and community partners have pursued in caring for rural Veterans, including challenges and opportunities, organizational domains shaping care coordination, and among these, initiatives that improve or impede health care outcomes. RESEARCH DESIGN: We followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to search 2 electronic databases (PubMed and Embase) for peer-reviewed articles published between January 2009 and May 2020. Building on prior research, we conducted a systematic review. RESULTS: Sixteen articles met our criteria. Each captured a unique health care focus while examining common challenges. Four organizational domains emerged: policy and administration, culture, mechanisms, and relational practices. Exemplars highlight how initiatives improve or impede rural health care delivery. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first systematic review, to our knowledge, examining interorganizational care coordination of rural Veterans by VA and Community Care programs. Results provide exemplars of interorganizational care coordination domains and program effectiveness. It suggests that partners' efforts to align their coordination domains can improve health care, with rurality serving as a critical contextual factor. Findings are important for policies, practices, and research of VA and Community Care partners committed to improving access and health care for rural Veterans.","Garvin, Lynn A; Pugatch, Marianne; Gurewich, Deborah; Pendergast, Jacquelyn N; Miller, Christopher J",Med Care,,264
400051,Dopamine Receptors in Parkinson's Disease: A Meta-Analysis of Imaging Studies,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly expanding global health crisis. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17), an ectodomain sheddase, is a key component of ACE2 modulation and plays a complex role in inflammation and immunosurveillance. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: Much remains unknown regarding the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19, including how the virus affects ADAM17 expression, activity, and regulation. SEARCH STRATEGY: Three electronic databases (MEDLINE through PubMed, Embase through Ovid, and Google Scholar) were searched to identify articles relevant to ADAM17 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 and 2. Relevant articles published from January 1, 2005, to April 30, 2020, were selected, and reference lists were screened and cross-referenced. We also searched preprint studies on medRxiv and bioRxiv given the rapidly evolving data on COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2. THERAPEUTIC OPINION: Infection with SARS-CoV-2 may lead to an increase in ADAM17 sheddase activity contributing to an exuberant macrophage-predominant inflammatory response and diminished immunosurveillance capacity for viral clearance. Emerging data suggest severe lung injury in COVID-19 is associated with higher levels of TNF-&#945; and IL-6, T-cell lymphopenia and exhaustion, hypercoagulability, and a macrophage-predominant immune response. This clinical picture is consistent with dysregulation of many of the molecular pathways in which ADAM17 participates. CONCLUSIONS: Elucidation of the role of ADAM17 in COVID-19 may identify novel molecular targets for drug development and therapeutic repurposement.","Schreiber, Brittany; Patel, Ankit; Verma, Ashish",Am. j. ther,,264

Retrospectively, 130 residual nasopharyngeal swabs transferred in viral transport medium (VTM), pre-examined for COVID-19 through emergency use authorization (EUA)-approved real-time RT-PCR assay and tested with GenBody&#8482; COVAG025, revealed a sensitivity and specificity of 90.00% (27/30; 95% CI: 73.47% to 97.89%) and 98.00% (98/100; 95% CI: 92.96% to 99.76%), respectively, fulfilling WHO guidelines. Subsequently, the prospective examination of 200 symptomatic and asymptomatic nasopharyngeal swabs, collected on site and tested with GenBody&#8482; COVAG025 and EUA-approved real-time RT-PCR assay simultaneously, revealed a significantly higher sensitivity and specificity of 94.00% (94/100; 95% CI: 87.40% to 97.77%) and 100.00% (100/100; 95% CI: 96.38% to 100.00%), respectively.

402123,ARB-Based Combination Therapy for the Clinical Management of Hypertension and Hypertension-Related Comorbidities: A Spotlight on Their Use in COVID-19 Patients,2021,"Importance: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has dramatically changed the US health care system, causing an influx of patients who require resources. Many oncologists are having challenging conversations with their patients about how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting cancer care and may desire evidence-based communication guidance. Objectives: To identify the clinical scenarios that pose communication challenges, understand patient reactions to these scenarios, and develop a communication guide with sample responses. Design, Setting, and Participants: This qualitative study that was conducted at a single Midwestern academic medical center invited physicians to respond to a brief semistructured interview by email or telephone and then disseminated an anonymous online survey among patients with cancer. Oncology-specific, COVID-19-related clinical scenarios were identified by the physicians, and potential reactions to these scenarios were gleaned from the patient responses to the survey. Health communication experts were invited to participate in the iterative development of a communication guide, comprising 3 essential communication principles and strategies and informed by insights from physicians and patients. This study was conducted from March 25, 2020, to April 2, 2020. Interventions: Expert review, interviews, and surveys assessing challenging situations specific to cancer management during the COVID-19 pandemic. Main Outcomes and Measures: Oncology-specific, COVID-19-related clinical scenarios from physician interviews; responses to each scenario from patient surveys; and applicable communication principles from health communication expert literature review. Results: Of the 8 physicians who participated in interviews, 4 were men (50%) and 4 were women (50%). These physicians represented the following disciplines: internal medicine (n = 1), hematology/oncology (n = 2), radiation oncology (n = 3), and surgical oncology (n = 2). Their disease site specialization included cancers of the breast, head and neck, melanoma, and gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. A total of 48 patients with cancer completed the online survey; no demographic information was collected from the patients. The physicians identified 8 oncology-specific, COVID-19-related scenarios in which communication might be challenging: (1) worse outcomes from COVID-19, (2) delay in cancer screening, (3) delay in diagnostic workup, (4) delay in initiation of treatment, (5) offer of nonstandard treatment, (6) treatment breaks, (7) delay in follow-up imaging or care, and (8) inability to be admitted into the hospital for management. Potential patient reactions to each of these scenarios were compiled from survey responses. For most scenarios, patient reactions involved anger, fear, and anxiety (eg, ""I'm scared""; ""This isn't fair. I am upset.""). These emotional patient responses informed the selection of the 3 general communication principles, which suggested language and strategies that physicians can use to respond to patients. Conclusions and Relevance: In this qualitative study, physicians and patients identified communication needs used by health communication experts to inform the development of a practical, evidence-based communication guide for oncology care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Gharzai, Laila A; Resnicow, Kenneth; An, Lawrence C; Jagsi, Reshma",JAMA Oncol,,264

403135,COVID-19 and pediatric fatty liver disease: Is there interplay?,2021,"Background: The new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) is now causing a severe public health emergency. The novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) infected individuals by binding human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor. ACE2 is widely expressed in multiple organs including respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive and urinary systems in healthy individuals. These tissues with high expression level of ACE2 seemed to be more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recently, it has been reported that patients with tumors were likely to be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and indicated poor prognosis. Methods: The tissue atlas database and the blood atlas were used to analyze the distribution of ACE2 in human tissues or organs of cancers and normal samples. Starbase dataset was applied to predict the prognosis of cancers according to expression level of ACE2. Results: In this study, we demonstrated a landscape profiling analysis on expression level of ACE2 in pan-cancers and showed the risky of different type of cancers to SARS-CoV-2 according to the expression level of ACE2. In addition, we found that ACE2 was both differential expression and related to the prognosis only in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC). Relative high expression of ACE2 indicated a favorable prognosis in LIHC, but they might be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: We indeed emphasized that LIHC patients with high expression level of ACE2 should be more cautious of the virus infection. Our study might provide a potential clue for preventing infection of SARS-CoV-2 in cancers.","Dai, Yu-Jun; Hu, Fang; Li, Huan; Huang, Han-Ying; Wang, Da-Wei; Liang, Yang",Ann. Transl. Med.,,264

This disease activates both the natural and acquired immune system. The cytokin storm, in which blood levels of proinflammatory cytokines are detected excessively high is developing and the uncontrolled inflammatory response causes local and systemic tissue damages. Although a spesific drug has not been found yet, the medications currently in use for other indications, whose pharmacokinetic- pharmacodynamic properties and toxic doses are already known; are included in the treatment practice of COVID-19. These drugs affect the entry of the virus into the cell and its intracellular distribution. They also have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects too. Therefore, we think that Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI's) with similar mechanisms of action may also be involved in COVID-19 treatment and prophylaxis.","Tastemur, Seyma; Ataseven, Hilmi",Med Hypotheses,,264

403277,Stable neutralizing antibody levels six months after mild and severe COVID-19 episode,2021,"Introduction: SARS-CoV-2 a new virus of the zoonotic coronavirus family causes the disease COVID-19, which has become a global pandemic. One of the ways for prevention of Covid-19 is by disabling its spike protein which results in inhibiting its binding with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2). The other alternative is to inhibit its replication once inside the body. The aim of this study was to explore the literature to identify whether there were any Ayurvedic remedies which contained ingredients which demonstrated this dual effect. Methods: : In silico studies were carried out to find the structures of the targets i.e. spike protein of the virus and its main protease (Mpro). Databases were searched to identify the composition of Ayurvedic decoctions used for respiratory ailments. Results: : We have found that two components out of 26 active ingredients of Ayurvedic decoction are strong binders for spike protein as well as corresponding Mpro (3CL protease) which plays an essential role in mediating viral replication and transcription, making it an attractive antiviral drug target. Out of 26 components of Ayurvedic herbal decoction used for influenza, one compound was found to be most active. It is a well-known antioxidant, antinflammatory and hepatoprotective molecule. Conclusion: : The resultant compound could act as a repurposed drug or like other methoxyphenols, could be a good lead molecule for a potent drug for Covid-19.","Shukla, Richa; Singh, Sangeeta; Singh, Anirudh; Misra, Krishna",Eur J Integr Med,,264

The National Health Service in the United Kingdom issued guidance to ensure that capacity was increased in acute medical settings, to prepare for the surge of COVID-19 cases. The Royal College of Ophthalmologists followed suit with guidance on the curtailment of all elective activity, aimed at protecting both patients and staff. Ophthalmology is one of the busiest outpatient specialities, and risk stratification of patients with appointments cancelled or on review lists was paramount to ensure there was no serious, permanent harm to sight. Our way of working, as we knew it, had to change in a short period of time. Local emergency eye care was changed from a walk in service, with the implementation of a strict triage protocol. Ophthalmologists, as well as Otorhinolaryngology colleagues, were identified as being at high risk of infection, due to the close proximity of clinical examination. The redesign of clinical areas to allow for social distancing, slit lamp barriers and personal protective equipment was all implemented.

As we make a transition from a service-based economy to experience economy, where time well saved takes a back seat to time well spent, the notion of employee experience (EX) is set to become a fundamental workplace design principle. EX is about the work, not the office. EX aims for a complete redesign of the workplace practices and environment to fit the employees and not the other way around. This article examines and verifies EX scale as one-dimensional as well as multidimensional constructs with six dimensions, namely cohesiveness, vigour, well-being, achievement, inclusiveness and physical environment. Six dimensions were explored with focus group and open-ended survey and validated with closed-ended survey of 299 employees working in multinational corporations across India. Structural equation modelling is used to validate the proposed latest construct. Establishing the EX scale would help researchers as well practitioners in empirically measuring EX and its relationship with various individuals as well organizational constructs.","Yadav, Mohit Vihari Nitin Simha",FIIB Business Review,,264

The disease produced by this virus, called Covid-19, presents with variable clinical manifestations, from practically asymptomatic patients with catarrhal processes to severe pneumonias that rapidly evolve to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure. In recent weeks, papers have been published describing coagulation disorders and arterial and venous thrombotic complications in these patients, mainly among those admitted to intensive care units. The infection triggers an immune response, which causes different inflammatory mediators to be released into the blood. These include cytokines, which interact with platelets and different coagulation proteins, and promote thrombogenesis. One of the most widely studied coagulation markers in Covid-19 is D-dimer (DD), raised levels of which have prognostic implications, although the best cut-off point for the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in this population has not been clarified, nor has its usefulness in determining the intensity of thromboprophylaxis required in these patients. Until sufficiently robust information (preferably from well-designed clinical trials) is available, the recommendations of clinical practice guidelines for the prophylaxis, diagnosis and treatment of VTE should be followed in Covid-19 patients.","López-Reyes, Raquel; Oscullo, Grace; Jiménez, David; Cano, Irene; García-Ortega, Alberto",Arch. bronconeumol.

METHODS: A literature search of Pubmed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Databases was performed to identify studies reporting POD after LT. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to rate study quality. Effect estimates were extracted and combined using random-effect model. Pooled mean differences and odds ratios for individual risk factors were calculated using inverse-variance method and Mantel-Haenszel method, as appropriate. RESULTS: Eight articles with 1434 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, the pooled estimated incidence rates of POD after LT were 30% (95% confidence interval: 20% - 39%). 14 statistically significant risk factors were identified in the pooled analysis: alcohol excess, preoperative renal replacement therapy (RRT), preoperative hospital length of stay (LOS), depression, hepatic encephalopathy, alcohol etiology of liver failure, Child-Turcotte-Pugh score, APACHE â ¡score, MELD score, preoperative INR, preoperative bilirubin, intraoperative use of fentanyl, intraoperative RBC transfusion, postoperative ammonia. Patients with POD had a significantly increased mechanical ventilation, postoperative RRT, LOS and mortality rate compared with those without POD. CONCLUSIONS: POD after LT was common and multifactorial in etiology. There are significant associations of POD after LT with some clinical outcomes. Effective interventions during perioperative period may be promising to reduce the risk of POD after LT.","Zhou, Jian; Xu, Xiaolin; Liang, Yongxin; Zhang, Xueying; Tu, Houan; Chu, Haichen",Minerva anestesiol,,264
406529,"Effect of a combination of nitazoxanide, ribavirin, and ivermectin plus zinc supplement (MANS.NRIZ study) on the clearance of mild COVID-19",2021,"Water is an essential component of food structures and biological materials. The importance of water as a parameter affecting virion stability and inactivation has been recognized across disciplinary areas. The large number of virus species, differences in spreading, likelihood of foodborne infections, unknown infective doses, and difficulties of infective virus quantification are often limiting experimental approaches to establish accurate data required for detailed understanding of virions’ stability and inactivation kinetics in various foods. Furthermore, non-foodborne viruses, as shown by the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) pandemic, may spread within the food chain. Traditional food engineering benefits from kinetic data on effects of relative humidity (RH) and temperature on virion inactivation. The stability of enteric viruses, human norovirus (HuNoV), and hepatitis A (HAV) virions in food materials and their resistance against inactivation in traditional food processing and preservation is well recognized. It appears that temperature-dependence of virus inactivation is less affected by virus strains than differences in temperature and RH sensitivity of individual virus species. Pathogenic viruses are stable at low temperatures typical of food storage conditions. A significant change in activation energy above typical protein denaturation temperatures suggests a rapid inactivation of virions. Furthermore, virus inactivation mechanisms seem to vary according to temperature. Although little is known on the effects of water on virions’ resistance during food processing and storage, dehydration, low RH conditions, and freezing stabilize virions. Enveloped virions tend to have a high stability at low RH, but low temperature and high RH may also stabilize such virions on metal and other surfaces for several days. Food engineering has contributed to significant developments in stabilization of nutrients, flavors, and sensitive components in food materials which provides a knowledge base for development of technologies to inactivate virions in foods and environment. Novel food processing, particularly high pressure processing (HPP) and cold plasma technologies, seem to provide efficient means for virion inactivation and food quality retention prior to packaging or food preservation by traditional technologies.","Roos, Yrjö H.",Food.

Currently, many strict control measures are applied in health care settings, including endoscopy units, in order to limit virus spread. Several recommendations called to limit endoscopic procedures to emergent endoscopies; however, several uncertainties still exist concerning patient safety, protective measures, and infection control methods in emergency endoscopic settings. In this case report, we present a case of successful endoscopic band ligation for bleeding esophageal varices in man with COVID-19 disease who presented with an acute attack of hematemesis while on mechanical ventilation (MV). Esophago-gastroduodenoscopy was performed in the ICU room after preparing the setting, and revealed large, risky esophageal varices. Endoscopic band ligation was done with successful control of bleeding. Third-level measures of medical protection were applied for the participating medical personnel, and patient monitoring was maintained all through the procedure. After the procedure, the bleeding stopped, and the patient was vitally stable and conscious. We conclude that emergency endoscopic interventions could be performed safely with appropriate arrangements in patients with confirmed COVID-19 on MV.","El Kassas, Mohamed; Al Shafie, Ahmad; Abdel Hameed, Abo Seif; Mahdi, Mamdouh",Dig Endosc,,264

The goal of this study was to assess the diagnostic values of different methods of detecting and estimating the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the auxiliary diagnostic potential of antibody assays. By retrospectively analyzing the data of viral RNAs and serum immunoglobulin M-immunoglobulin G antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 from 38 cases with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 in the Second People's Hospital of Fuyang, we found that, in the early phase of the illness, the viral RNA was most abundant in the sputum specimens, followed by that in the throat swabs, while the antibody assays identified fewer positive cases at this stage. However, the sensitivity of the antibody assays overtook that of RNA test from the eighth day of disease onset. Simultaneous use of antibody assay and reverse transcription-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction improved the sensitivity of the diagnoses. Moreover, we found that most of these cases with no detectable viral RNA load during the early stages were able to be seropositive after 7 days. Our findings indicate that the antibody detection could be used as an effective supplementary indicator of SARS-CoV-2 infection in suspected cases with no detectable viral RNA, and in conjunction with nucleic acid detection in confirming the infection.","Yong, Gao; Yi, Yuan; Tuantuan, Li; Xiaowu, Wang; Xiuyong, Li; Ang, Li; Mingfeng, Han",J. med. virol,,264

The objectives of this study were to assess SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence, individual exposure risk factors and compliance of HCWs to wear personal protective equipment (PPE). After the first nosocomial COVID-19 outbreak at JUH, mandatory masking was implemented on 20th March 2020. We evaluated point seroprevalence using two IgG detecting immunoassays and issued a questionnaire to assess COVID-19 exposure, clinical symptoms and compliance to wear PPE. Antibody retesting was offered to participants with a divergent result of both immunoassays 5-10 weeks after the first test. Between 19th May and 19th June 2020, we analysed 660 participants [out of 3,228; 20.4%]. Among them, 212 participants (32.1%) had received a previous COVID-19 test. Four of them (1.9%) reported a positive test result. After recruitment, 18 participants (2.7%) had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in at least one immunoassay. Overall, 21 participants (3.2%) had any evidence of a past or current SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among them, 13 (61.9%) were not aware of direct COVID-19 exposure and 9 (42.9%) did not report any clinical symptoms. COVID-19 exposure at home (adjusted OR (aOR) with 95% CI: 47.82 (5.49, 416.62)) was associated with SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence. We observed no evidence for an association between seroprevalence and exposure at work (aOR 0.48 (0.13, 1.70)) or with COVID-19 risk area according to the working place (aOR for intermediate-risk vs. high-risk: 1.97 (0.42, 9.22), aOR for low-risk versus high-risk: 2.10 (0.40, 11.06); p = .655). Reported compliance of HCWs to wear PPE differed (p < .001) between working in high-risk (98.3%) and in intermediate-risk areas (69.8%). In conclusion, compared to administration staff, we observed no additional risk to acquire SARS-CoV-2 infections by patient care, probably due to high compliance to wear PPE.","Bahrs, Christina; Kimmig, Aurelia; Weis, Sebastian; Ankert, Juliane; Hagel, Stefan; Maschmann, Jens; Stallmach, Andreas; Steiner, Andrea; Bauer, Michael; Behringer, Wilhelm; Baier, Michael; Kesselmeier, Miriam; Richert, Cora; Zepf, Florian; Walter, Martin; Scherag, André; Kiehntopf, Michael; Löffler, Bettina; Pletz, Mathias W",Transbound. emerg. dis.

This study, which used a cross-sectional correlational design, aimed to assess the levels of fear and health anxiety and to investigate their predictors during the current outbreak of COVID-19 in immunocompromised and chronic disease patients in Saudi Arabia. Sociodemographic and clinical data, fear of COVID-19, and health anxiety measurements were collected by online surveys from June 15 to July 15, 2020. Univariate and multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify predictors. A total of 1,030 patients in 13 provinces in Saudi Arabia completed the questionnaire. A significant number of patients with chronic diseases experienced considerable levels of fear and anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak. It was found that 21.44% of participants met the criteria for anxiety cases, and 19.4% were considered borderline anxiety cases. In regression analysis, significant predictors of fear and health anxiety were female gender, lower education, middle-aged, divorced or widowed, receiving immunosuppressants, type of chronic disease (Crohn's disease, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases), and media use as a source of knowledge about COVID-19. Immunocompromised and chronic disease patients are vulnerable to fear and anxiety during epidemic infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Optimizing this population's compliance with appropriate infection prevention and control strategies is crucial during the infectious outbreaks to ensure their safety, to decrease the risk of infection and serious complications, and reduce their fear and health anxiety. Effective positive psychological interventions and support strategies also need to be immediately implemented to increase psychological resilience and improve the mental health of these patients. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, chronic disease patients in Saudi Arabia need special attention from health authorities, policymakers, and healthcare professionals to manage maladaptive forms of health anxiety and fear.","Al-Rahimi, Jehan S; Nass, Nada M; Hassoubah, Shahira A; Wazqar, Dhuha Y; Alamoudi, Soha A",PLoS One,,264

This policy has encouraged several universities to improve the quality of their distance learning services. However, it seems that the government has not gone deep enough to conduct a preliminary study on each university website's readiness to face this. Based on previous research, the university website impact factor is one of the criteria for increasing webometrics rankings. Still, it is not explained in detail the types of referring pages and domains that can affect webometrics rankings. This research investigates the extent to which R-WIF affects webometrics and examines the factors that can improve the university website's quality. We surveyed the revised web impact factor (R-WIF) at seven universities in Timor Leste to determine their academic sites' relative standing. The results show, although some universities have increased the number of backlinks, the webometrics university ranking prefers backlinks that come from high-authorization sites such as .edu and .gov. The correlation value indicates this phenomenon between R-WIF and Webometrics of 0.464, which means moderate. Universities in Timor Leste need to implement several strategies to improve Webometrics rankings, especially visibility. © 2021, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

420454,"Changes in Characteristics, Treatment and Outcome in Patients with Hemorrhagic Stroke During COVID-19",2021,"Time series forecasting is a growing domain with diverse applications. However, changes of the system behavior over time due to internal or external influences are challenging. Therefore, predictions of a previously learned fore-casting model might not be useful anymore. In this paper, we present EVent-triggered Augmented Refitting of Gaussian Process Regression for Seasonal Data (EVARS-GPR), a novel online algorithm that is able to handle sudden shifts in the target variable scale of seasonal data. For this purpose, EVARS-GPR com-bines online change point detection with a refitting of the prediction model using data augmentation for samples prior to a change point. Our experiments on sim-ulated data show that EVARS-GPR is applicable for a wide range of output scale changes. EVARS-GPR has on average a 20.8 % lower RMSE on different real-world datasets compared to methods with a similar computational resource con-sumption. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm leads to a six-fold reduction of the averaged runtime in relation to all comparison partners with a periodical refitting strategy. In summary, we present a computationally efficient online fore-casting algorithm for seasonal time series with changes of the target variable scale and demonstrate its functionality on simulated as well as real-world data.

422377,COVID-19-another influential event impacts on laboratory medicine management,2021,"The coronavirus is a pathogen that mainly attacks the human respiratory system Previous coronavirus outbreaks (CoV) include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the clinical spectrum of COVID19 is very broad ranging from mild symptoms to ARDS to multiple organ failure and death. A history of DM2, advanced age and other comorbidities are considered predictors of higher morbidity and mortality, it is also known that blood glucose and DM levels are independent predictors of morbidity and mortality in patients with SARS. It should be remembered that patients with DM2 suffer from a chronic low grade inflammation that could facilitate the cytokine storm which in turn would be the cause of severe cases of COVID 19 pneumonia and the eventual death of many patients. Glucocorticoids have a stimulating and inhibitory effect on the immune response according to the moment in which it is administered and its circulating levels insulin therapy has been shown to decrease inflammation. For the control of glycemia the objectives must be individualized. Glycemic and individualized targets for non critical hospitalized patients have been established by different scientific societies such as ADA and AACE and Endocrine Society. In Honduras the protocol for the clinical management of adult patients with COVID 19 was developed to establish and standardize timely treatment in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID 19 which consists of the MAIZ scheme and the MAIZ scheme AAA. A retrospective longitudinal descriptive study was carried out with a review of the data obtained from 32 patients diagnosed with DM2 and COVID19 during the months of June through September 2020 at the CAMI Comprehensive Medical Care Clinic located in the city of Tegucigalpa Honduras collecting epidemiological and clinical data. The results of the research show that of the 32 patients with DM2 and COVID 19, 59% (19) belong to the male gender and 41% (13) to the female gender, with an average age of 60 years. In the COVID19 severity classification the evaluated patients presented in the following condition mild 25% (8), moderate 69% (22) and severe 6% (2). The diagnostic method used was detection of anti SARS CoV2 antibodies 56% (17) and TR-PCR 43% (14). 75% (24) received steroids, 8.69% (2) of the patients who used steroids in their management had hyperglycemia and required management with regular insulin. 100% (32) of the patients who were treated recovered without registering any death. Conclusions: are that the pathophysiological factors of DM2 in relation to the immune system of patients can be a determining factor to present a degree of severity greater than that presented by the general population that falls ill with COVID19. Adequate glycemic control can determine a better prognosis in the evolution of the disease despite its degree of severity.","Videa, Elvin Omar Murillo Nancy Gabriela Rodríguez Alvarenga Pamela Carolina Ochoa Vania Lizeth Barahona",Journal of the Endocrine Society,,264

424702,Lymphocyte may be a reference index of the outcome of cancer patients with COVID-19,2021,"Background: Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces an antibody response targeting multiple antigens that changes over time. This study aims to take advantage of this complexity to develop more accurate serological diagnostics. Methods: A multiplex serological assay was developed to measure IgG and IgM antibody responses to seven SARS-CoV-2 spike or nucleoprotein antigens, two antigens for the nucleoproteins of the 229E and NL63 seasonal coronaviruses, and three non-coronavirus antigens. Antibodies were measured in serum samples collected up to 39 days after symptom onset from 215 adults in four French hospitals (53 patients and 162 health-care workers) with quantitative RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and negative control serum samples collected from healthy adult blood donors before the start of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic (335 samples from France, Thailand, and Peru). Machine learning classifiers were trained with the multiplex data to classify individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the best classification performance displayed by a random forests algorithm. A Bayesian mathematical model of antibody kinetics informed by prior information from other coronaviruses was used to estimate time-varying antibody responses and assess the sensitivity and classification performance of serological diagnostics during the first year following symptom onset. A statistical estimator is presented that can provide estimates of seroprevalence in very low-transmission settings. Findings: IgG antibody responses to trimeric spike protein (Stri) identified individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection with 91·6% (95% CI 87·5-94·5) sensitivity and 99·1% (97·4-99·7) specificity. Using a serological signature of IgG and IgM to multiple antigens, it was possible to identify infected individuals with 98·8% (96·5-99·6) sensitivity and 99·3% (97·6-99·8) specificity. Informed by existing data from other coronaviruses, we estimate that 1 year after infection, a monoplex assay with optimal anti-Stri IgG cutoff has 88·7% (95% credible interval 63·4-97·4) sensitivity and that a four-antigen multiplex assay can increase sensitivity to 96·4% (80·9-100·0). When applied to population-level serological surveys, statistical analysis of multiplex data allows estimation of seroprevalence levels less than 2%, below the false-positivity rate of many other assays. Interpretation: Serological signatures based on antibody responses to multiple antigens can provide accurate and robust serological classification of individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. This provides potential solutions to two pressing challenges for SARS-CoV-2 serological surveillance: classifying individuals who were infected more than 6 months ago and measuring seroprevalence in serological surveys in very low-transmission settings.

425044,Giant sinus of Valsalva aneurysm mimicking severe pulmonary hypertension,2020,"Hydrophobic pollutants have become widely distributed across the world. From an agricultural perspective, their accumulation in crops from contaminated soil threatens food security and quality, leading to many diseases in humans. The Cucurbitaceae family can accumulate high concentrations of hydrophobic pollutants in their aerial parts. The Cucurbitaceae family contains major latex-like proteins (MLPs) as transporting factors for hydrophobic pollutants. MLP genes are expressed in the roots in which the MLPs bind hydrophobic pollutants. MLPs transport these hydrophobic pollutants to the aerial parts of the plant through the xylem vessels. As a result, hydrophobic pollutant contamination occurs in the Cucurbitaceae family. In this study, we suppressed the expression of MLP genes in the roots and reduced the amounts of MLPs with pesticide treatments. First, the fungicides Benlate and Daconil that deceased the hydrophobic pollutant, perylene, concentration in the xylem sap of zucchini plants were selected. Daconil suppressed the transcription activity of MLP in the roots. In the Daconil treatment, the amount of MLPs in the roots and xylem sap of zucchini plants was decreased, and the concentrations of the hydrophobic pollutants, pyrene and dieldrin, were significantly decreased. Our research contributes to the production of safer crops.","Fujita, Kentaro; Haga, Yuki; Yoshihara, Ryouhei; Matsumura, Chisato; Inui, Hideyuki",Sci Total Environ,,264

427951,COVID-19 and the liver: overview,2020,"Recent reports suggest that routine childhood immunization coverage might have decreased during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (1,2). To assess the capacity of pediatric health care practices to provide immunization services to children during the pandemic, a survey of practices participating in the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program was conducted during May 12-20, 2020. Data were weighted to account for the sampling design; thus, all percentages reported are weighted. Among 1,933 responding practices, 1,727 (89.8%) were currently open; 1,397 (81.1%) of these reported offering immunization services to all of their patients. When asked whether the practice would likely be able to accommodate new patients to assist with provision of immunization services through August, 1,135 (59.1%) respondents answered affirmatively. These results suggest that health care providers appear to have the capacity to deliver routinely recommended childhood vaccines, allowing children to catch up on vaccines that might have been delayed as a result of COVID-19-related effects on the provision of or demand for routine well child care. Health care providers and immunization programs should educate parents on the need to return for well-child and immunization visits or refer patients to other practices, if they are unable to provide services (3).","Vogt, Tara M; Zhang, Fan; Banks, Michelle; Black, Carla; Arthur, Bayo; Kang, Yoonjae; Lucas, Paul; Lamont, Brock",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,264

In this setting, topotecan demonstrated modest activity with significant toxicity. Paclitaxel was also active. This study was designed to evaluate activity and safety of nab-paclitaxel in relapsed SCLC. METHODS: In this multicentre prospective Phase 2 trial, patients with refractory or sensitive SCLC progressed to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy received nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/smq on days 1, 8, 15 every 4 weeks up to six cycles, progressive disease or intolerable toxicity. Primary endpoint was investigator-assessed objective tumour response. Secondary endpoints were toxicity, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Of the 68 patients treated, partial response was 8% in the refractory cohort and 14% in the sensitive cohort. Most common toxicities of any grade were fatigue (54%), anaemia (38%), neutropenia (29%), leukopenia (26%) and diarrhoea (21%). Median PFS was similar in both refractory (1.8 months) and sensitive cohorts (1.9 months), while median OS was longer in sensitive one (6.6 versus 3.6 months). CONCLUSIONS: Although nab-paclitaxel has shown some modest anti-tumour activity in relapsed SCLC, associated with a favourable toxicity profile, the primary end-point of the study was not met.

There is limited evidence on the association of in-hospital anticoagulation (AC) with outcomes and postmortem findings. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine association of AC with in-hospital outcomes and describe thromboembolic findings on autopsies. METHODS: This retrospective analysis examined the association of AC with mortality, intubation, and major bleeding. Subanalyses were also conducted on the association of therapeutic versus prophylactic AC initiated &#8804;48 h from admission. Thromboembolic disease was contextualized by premortem AC among consecutive autopsies. RESULTS: Among 4,389 patients, median age was 65 years with 44% women. Compared with no AC (n = 1,530; 34.9%), therapeutic AC (n = 900; 20.5%) and prophylactic AC (n = 1,959; 44.6%) were associated with lower in-hospital mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.45 to 0.62 and aHR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.57, respectively), and intubation (aHR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.51 to 0.94 and aHR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.58 to 0.89, respectively). When initiated &#8804;48 h from admission, there was no statistically significant difference between therapeutic (n = 766) versus prophylactic AC (n = 1,860) (aHR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.73 to 1.02; p = 0.08). Overall, 89 patients (2%) had major bleeding adjudicated by clinician review, with 27 of 900 (3.0%) on therapeutic, 33 of 1,959 (1.7%) on prophylactic, and 29 of 1,530 (1.9%) on no AC. Of 26 autopsies, 11 (42%) had thromboembolic disease not clinically suspected and 3 of 11 (27%) were on therapeutic AC. CONCLUSIONS: AC was associated with lower mortality and intubation among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Compared with prophylactic AC, therapeutic AC was associated with lower mortality, although not statistically significant. Autopsies revealed frequent thromboembolic disease.

Although it is clear that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is transmitted through human respiratory droplets and direct contact, the potential for aerosol transmission is poorly understood1-3. Here we investigated the aerodynamic nature of SARS-CoV-2 by measuring viral RNA in aerosols in different areas of two Wuhan hospitals during the outbreak of COVID-19 in February and March 2020. The concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols that was detected in isolation wards and ventilated patient rooms was very low, but it was higher in the toilet areas used by the patients. Levels of airborne SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the most public areas was undetectable, except in two areas that were prone to crowding; this increase was possibly due to individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the crowd. We found that some medical staff areas initially had high concentrations of viral RNA with aerosol size distributions that showed peaks in the submicrometre and/or supermicrometre regions; however, these levels were reduced to undetectable levels after implementation of rigorous sanitization procedures. Although we have not established the infectivity of the virus detected in these hospital areas, we propose that SARS-CoV-2 may have the potential to be transmitted through aerosols. Our results indicate that room ventilation, open space, sanitization of protective apparel, and proper use and disinfection of toilet areas can effectively limit the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols. Future work should explore the infectivity of aerosolized virus.","Liu, Yuan; Ning, Zhi; Chen, Yu; Guo, Ming; Liu, Yingle; Gali, Nirmal Kumar; Sun, Li; Duan, Yusen; Cai, Jing; Westerdahl, Dane; Liu, Xinjin; Xu, Ke; Ho, Kin-Fai; Kan, Haidong; Fu, Qingyan; Lan, Ke",Nature,,264

All three leading dengue vaccine candidates are live attenuated vaccines, with the main difference between them being the type of backbone and the extent of chimerization. While CYD-TDV (the first licensed dengue vaccine) does not include non-structural proteins of dengue, TAK-003 contains the dengue virus serotype 2 backbone, and the Butantan/Merck vaccine contains three full-genomes of the four dengue virus serotypes. While dengue-primed individuals can already benefit from vaccination against all four serotypes with the first licensed dengue vaccine CYD-TDV, the need for dengue-naive population has not yet been met. To improve tetravalent protection, sequential vaccination should be considered in addition to a heterologous prime-boost approach.","Wilder-Smith, Annelies",Curr Opin Virol,,264

The purpose of this study was to identify how health behaviors, level of stress, financial and food security have been impacted by the pandemic among Canadian families with young children. Parents (mothers, n = 235 and fathers, n = 126) from 254 families participating in an ongoing study completed an online survey that included close and open-ended questions. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the quantitative data and qualitative responses were analyzed using thematic analysis. More than half of our sample reported that their eating and meal routines have changed since COVID-19; most commonly reported changes were eating more snack foods and spending more time cooking. Screen time increased among 74% of mothers, 61% of fathers, and 87% of children and physical activity decreased among 59% of mothers, 52% of fathers, and 52% of children. Key factors influencing family stress include balancing work with childcare/homeschooling and financial instability. While some unhealthful behaviors appeared to have been exacerbated, other more healthful behaviors also emerged since COVID-19. Research is needed to determine the longer-term impact of the pandemic on behaviors and to identify effective strategies to support families in the post-COVID-19 context.","Carroll, Nicholas; Sadowski, Adam; Laila, Amar; Hruska, Valerie; Nixon, Madeline; Ma, David W L; Haines, Jess",Nutrients,,264

Due to its ecological role and susceptibility to distinct zoonotic agents, E. europaeus could be a suitable sentinel candidate for many global problems that negatively affect human and animal health. Hedgehogs can work as bioindicators to environmental contamination and can be hosts for multiple tickborne zoonotic agents. Thus, people who directly or indirectly make physical contact with this species are exposed to a variety of threats. Moreover, it has also been studied as an indicator for antibiotic resistance, which was already confirmed for tetracyclines. Additionally, it was also reported as a reservoir for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). More recently, hedgehogs have been recently recognised as potential reservoirs of MERS-CoV-like strains. Among other animals, this species can possibly represent an intermediate reservoir for SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this review is to briefly expose the scientific attainments about hedgehog health, namely agents, diseases, and threats that significantly affect general health concerns and that contribute to achieve One Health principles.","Jota Baptista, Catarina Vinhas Seixas Fernanda Gonzalo-Orden José Manuel Oliveira Paula A.",Biologics,,264

437641,Preprint Servers in Kidney Disease Research: A Rapid Review,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 is a new beta coronavirus, similar to SARS-CoV-1, that emerged at the end of 2019 in the Hubei province of China. It is responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. The ability to gain quick control of the pandemic has been hampered by a lack of detailed knowledge about SARS-CoV-2-host interactions, mainly in relation to viral biology and host immune response. The rapid clinical course seen in COVID-19 indicates that infection control in asymptomatic patients or patients with mild disease is probably due to the innate immune response, as, considering that SARS-CoV-2 is new to humans, an effective adaptive response would not be expected to occur until approximately 2-3 weeks after contact with the virus. Antiviral innate immunity has humoral components (complement and coagulation-fibrinolysis systems, soluble proteins that recognize glycans on cell surface, interferons, chemokines, and naturally occurring antibodies) and cellular components (natural killer cells and other innate lymphocytes). Failure of this system would pave the way for uncontrolled viral replication in the airways and the mounting of an adaptive immune response, potentially amplified by an inflammatory cascade. Severe COVID-19 appears to be due not only to viral infection but also to a dysregulated immune and inflammatory response. In this paper, the authors review the most recent publications on the immunobiology of SARS-CoV-2, virus interactions with target cells, and host immune responses, and highlight possible associations between deficient innate and acquired immune responses and disease progression and mortality. Immunotherapeutic strategies targeting both the virus and dysfunctional immune responses are also addressed.","Boechat, J L; Chora, I; Morais, A; Delgado, L","Pulmonology (Barc., Print)",,264

This study surveyed 3275 Chinese parents' beliefs and attitudes around young children's online learning during the lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most parents (92.7%) in the study reported that their children had online learning experiences during the pandemic, and many (84.6%) spent less than a half-hour each time. The parents generally had negative beliefs about the values and benefits of online learning and preferred traditional learning in early childhood settings. They tended to resist and even reject online learning for three key reasons: the shortcomings of online learning, young children's inadequate self-regulation, and their lack of time and professional knowledge in supporting children's online learning. Also, the hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has made them suffering, thus more resistant to online learning at home. The results suggested that the implementation of online learning during the pandemic has been problematic and challenging for families. The Chinese parents were neither trained nor ready to embrace online learning.

COVID-19 and related safety restrictions have thrust healthcare workers and researchers into a new reality of healthcare that relies heavily, or even exclusively, on telehealth methods. These changes have forced treatment providers and researchers to be agile in adopting these methods in order to maintain continuity of patient care and data collection. There are unique considerations that should be taken into account as telehealth practices continue to augment SUD care and research, even when restrictions have been lifted. Overall, we propose that telehealth can support innovation in treatment and research focused on SUDs and should be an integral part of our work, beyond COVID-19.","Kleykamp, Bethea A.; Guille, Constance; Barth, Kelly S.; McClure, Erin A.",J.

438817,Defining the clinical phenotype of COVID-19 in children,2020,"The contamination of the environment by crude oil and its by-products, mainly composed of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, is a widespread problem. Biodegradation by bacteria is one of the processes responsible for the removal of these pollutants. This study was conducted to determine the abilities of Burkholderia sp. B5, Cupriavidus sp. B1, Pseudomonas sp. T1, and another Cupriavidus sp. X5 to degrade binary mixtures of octane (representing aliphatic hydrocarbons) with benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, or xylene (BTEX as aromatic hydrocarbons) at a final concentration of 100 ppm under aerobic conditions. These strains were isolated from an enriched bacterial consortium (Yabase or Y consortium) that prefer to degrade aromatic hydrocarbon over aliphatic hydrocarbons. We found that B5 degraded all BTEX compounds more rapidly than octane. In contrast, B1, T1 and X5 utilized more of octane over BTX compounds. B5 also preferred to use benzene over octane with varying concentrations of up to 200 mg/l. B5 possesses alkane hydroxylase (alkB) and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23D) genes, which are responsible for the degradation of alkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons, respectively. This study strongly supports our notion that Burkholderia played a key role in the preferential degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons over aliphatic hydrocarbons in the previously characterized Y consortium. The preferential degradation of more toxic aromatic hydrocarbons over aliphatics is crucial in risk-based bioremediation.","Bacosa, Hernando P; Mabuhay-Omar, Jhonamie A; Balisco, Rodulf Anthony T; Omar, Dawin M; Inoue, Chihiro",World J Microbiol Biotechnol,,264

441058,COVID-19 encephalitis and Wernicke's encephalopathy,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to identify demographic, clinical and medical care factors associated with mortality in three nursing homes. METHODS: Two nursing homes were hospital-dependent, had connections with infection prevention and control departments, and had permanent physicians. Third nursing home had no direct connection with general hospital, no infection control practitioner, and no permanent physician. The main outcome was death. RESULTS: During first 3 months of the outbreak, 224/375 (59.7%) residents were classified ""COVID-19 cases"" and 57/375 (15.2%) died. Hospital dependent nursing homes had lower COVID-19 case fatality rates in comparison to non-hospital dependent nursing home (15 [6.6%] vs 38 [25.8%], OR 0.20 [0.11-0.38], p = 0.001). During first 3 weeks of the outbreak, mortality in COVID-19 patients decreased if they had daily clinical examination (aOR: 0.09 [0.03-0.35], p = 0.01), 3 vital signs measurements per day (OR: 0.06 [0.01-0.30], p = 0.001) and prophylactic anticoagulation (OR: 0 [0.00-0.24], p = 0.001).

441110,Lung cancer patients and COVID-19 epidemic: an experience from an Italian university hospital,2020,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic led to closure of nearly all K-12 schools in the United States of America in March 2020. Although reopening K-12 schools for in-person schooling is desirable for many reasons, officials understand that risk reduction strategies and detection of cases are imperative in creating a safe return to school. Furthermore, consequences of reclosing recently opened schools are substantial and impact teachers, parents, and ultimately educational experiences in children. To address competing interests in meeting educational needs with public safety, we compare the impact of physical separation through school cohorts on SARS-CoV-2 infections against policies acting at the level of individual contacts within classrooms. Using an age-stratified Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed model, we explore influences of reduced class density, transmission mitigation, and viral detection on cumulative prevalence. We consider several scenarios over a 6-month period including (1) multiple rotating cohorts in which students cycle through in-person instruction on a weekly basis, (2) parallel cohorts with in-person and remote learning tracks, (3) the impact of a hypothetical testing program with ideal and imperfect detection, and (4) varying levels of aggregate transmission reduction. Our mathematical model predicts that reducing the number of contacts through cohorts produces a larger effect than diminishing transmission rates per contact. Specifically, the latter approach requires dramatic reduction in transmission rates in order to achieve a comparable effect in minimizing infections over time. Further, our model indicates that surveillance programs using less sensitive tests may be adequate in monitoring infections within a school community by both keeping infections low and allowing for a longer period of instruction. Lastly, we underscore the importance of factoring infection prevalence in deciding when a local outbreak of infection is serious enough to require reverting to remote learning.","Landeros, Alfonso; Ji, Xiang; Lange, Kenneth; Stutz, Timothy C; Xu, Jason; Sehl, Mary E; Sinsheimer, Janet S",PLoS One,,264

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) patients frequently require immunosuppressive therapy and are known to be at risk of opportunistic infections. AREAS COVERED: We hereby review the available literature pertaining to COVID-19 in IBD based on published consensus guidelines, expert opinions, case series, registries and reports. EXPERT OPINION: Preliminary data suggests no increase in incidence of COVID-19 in IBD patients as compared to general population. Morbidity and mortality rates attributable to COVID-19 are also similar in IBD patients as compared to general population. Though exact reason is unknown, some aspects of COVID-19 pathogenesis may explain this paradox. Medications for IBD need to be carefully reviewed during COVID-19 crisis. Steroids may need dose tapering or substitution to avoid complications based on anecdotal evidence. Endoscopic procedures for IBD maybe deferred unless absolutely necessary. General measures recommended for COVID-19 tailored to specific needs of IBD patients maybe the best way to prevent infection. Our understanding of the disease outcomes and optimal management protocols are likely to evolve as we move ahead in this pandemic.","Anikhindi, Shrihari Anil; Kumar, Ashish; Arora, Anil",Expert Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol,,264

METHODS: All oncology preparations compounded from January 2016 through December 2018 using either system were included in our retrospective analysis. Final preparation accuracy, IV system precision, and workflow throughput (analyzed using lean process methodologies) were evaluated. RESULTS: Data analysis indicated that use of the IV gravimetric TAWF system was associated with a significantly lower percentage of accuracy errors compared to the IV robotics system (1.58% vs 2.47%, P < 0.001), with no significant difference in absolute precision (1.12 vs 1.12 P = 0.952). Lean analysis demonstrated that overall completion time (17:49 minutes vs 24:45 minutes) and compound preparation time (2:39 minutes vs 6:07 minutes) were less with the IV gravimetric TAWF vs the IV robotics system. CONCLUSION: Implementation of either an IV gravimetric TAWF system or IV robotics system will result in similar compounding accuracy and precision. Preparation time was less with use of the IV gravimetric TAWF vs the IV robotic system, but the IV robotic system required less human intervention. Both systems ensure medication safety for patients, although the IV robotic system has increased safeguards in place. Therefore, the primary driver for implementing these systems is alternative factors such as cost of systems implementation and maintenance, employee safety, and drug waste.","Pang, Bob; Earl, Marc; Knoer, Scott; Yaniv, Angela; Willner, Marc; Boyd, Anthony",Am. j. health system pharm,,264
443212,High Levels of Circulating IL-8 and Soluble IL-2R Are Associated With Prolonged Illness in Patients With Severe COVID-19,2021,"The available COVID-19 literature has focused on specific disease manifestations, infection control, and delivery or prioritization of services for specific patient groups in the setting of the acute COVID-19 pandemic. Local health systems aim to contain the COVID-19 pandemic and hospitals and health-care providers rush to provide the capacity for a surge of COVID-19 patients. However, the short, medium-term, and long-term outcomes of patients with gastrointestinal (GI) diseases without COVID-19 will be affected by the ability to develop locally adapted strategies to meet their service needs in the COVID-19 setting. To mitigate risks for patients with GI diseases, it is useful to differentiate three phases: (i) the acute phase, (ii) the adaptation phase, and (iii) the consolidation phase. During the acute phase, service delivery for patients with GI disease will be curtailed to meet competing health-care needs of COVID-19 patients. During the adaptation phase, GI services are calibrated towards a ""new normal,"" and the consolidation phase is characterized by rapid introduction and ongoing refinement of services. Proactive planning with engagement of relevant stakeholders including consumer representatives is required to be prepared for a variety of scenarios that are dictated by thus far undefined long-term economic and societal impacts of the pandemic. Because substantial changes to the delivery of services are likely to occur, it is important that these changes are embedded into quality and research frameworks to ensure that data are generated that support evidence-based decision-making during the adaptation and consolidation phases.","Holtmann, Gerald; Quigley, Eamonn M; Shah, Ayesha; Camilleri, Michael; Tan, Victoria Py; Gwee, Kok Ann; Sugano, Kentaro; Sollano, Jose D; Fock, Kwong M; Ghoshal, Uday C; Chen, Minhu; Dignass, Axel; Cohen, Henry",J Gastroenterol Hepatol,,264

Since isolated systems are very rare to find in any context, specially in human contact networks, here we examine the susceptible-infected-recovered model of disease spreading in a multiplex network formed by two distinct networks or layers that are interconnected through a fraction $q$ of shared individuals. We model the interactions between individuals in each layer through a weighted network, because person-to-person interactions are diverse (or disordered); weights represent the contact times of these interactions and we use a distribution of contact times to assign an individual disorder to each layer. Using branching theory supported by simulations, we study a social distancing strategy where we reduce the average contact time in one layer (or in both of them, if necessary). We find a set of disorder parameters - associated with average contact times - that prevents a disease from becoming an epidemic. When the disease is very likely to spread, the system is always in an epidemic phase, regardless of the disorder parameters and the fraction of shared nodes. However we find that it is still possible to protect a giant component of susceptible individuals, which is crucial to keep the functionality of the system composed by the two interconnected layers.","Perez, I.

Dysregulated immune response marks severe COVID-19, but the immunological mechanisms driving COVID-19 pathogenesis are still largely unknown, which is hampering the development of efficient treatments. Here we analyzed ~140 parameters of cellular and humoral immune response in peripheral blood of 41 COVID-19 patients and 16 age/gender-matched healthy donors by flow-cytometry, quantitative PCR, western blot and ELISA, followed by integrated correlation analyses with ~30 common clinical and laboratory parameters. We found that lymphocytopenia in severe COVID-19 patients (n=20) strongly affects T, NK and NKT cells, but not B cells and antibody production. Unlike increased activation of ICOS-1+ CD4+ T cells in mild COVID-19 patients (n=21), T cells in severe patients showed impaired activation, low IFN-Î³ production and high functional exhaustion, which correlated with significantly down-regulated HLA-DR expression in monocytes, dendritic cells and B cells. The latter phenomenon was followed by lower interferon responsive factor (IRF)-8 and autophagy-related genes expressions, and the expansion of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC). Intriguingly, PD-L1-, ILT-3-, and IDO-1-expressing monocytic MDSC were the dominant producers of IL-6 and IL-10, which correlated with the increased inflammation and accumulation of regulatory B and T cell subsets in severe COVID-19 patients. Overall, down-regulated IRF-8 and autophagy-related genes expression, and the expansion of MDSC subsets could play critical roles in dysregulating T cell response in COVID-19, which could have large implications in diagnostics and design of novel therapeutics for this disease.","Tomic, Sergej; Dokic, Jelena; Stevanovic, Dejan; Ilic, Natasa; Gruden-Movsesijan, Alisa; Dinic, Miroslav; Radojevic, Dusan; Bekic, Marina; Mitrovic, Nebojsa; Tomasevic, Ratko; Mikic, Dragan; Stojanovic, Dragos; Colic, Miodrag",Front Immunol,,264

450731,Convalescent Plasma Antibody Levels and the Risk of Death from Covid-19,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Proponents of a single-payer or public option health care system often cite the lower administrative expenses in public Medicare compared with those in private Medicare, claiming that this difference represents efficiency. We check the validity of this comparison in terms of accuracy and definitions and suggest expanding its scope to include expanded financial data of the 2 Medicare systems. STUDY DESIGN: Using annual Medicare Boards of Trustees and National Health Expenditure Accounts data from CMS and health insurers' financial statement data, we compare the level and percentage of the administrative expenses of the Medicare systems and show incompatible and not reconcilable definitions of administrative expenses. We expand our analysis to income, benefits, gains and losses, and loss ratios of the programs. METHODS: Our methodology is a careful comparison of categories of expenses between public and private insurers using official data sources. The comparison is both qualitative and quantitative. RESULTS: We validate the low administrative expenses of Medicare parts A, B, and D (1.35% of benefits in 2018) compared with Medicare Part C (10.86% of benefits without loss adjustment expenses [LAE] and 14.84% with LAE for 2018). Expanding the focus, the income and benefits per beneficiary grew faster and larger in Medicare parts A, B, and D than in Medicare Part C-a reversal of earlier trends. The public Medicare program suffered losses in 11 years during 2002-2018, whereas private insurers' Medicare remained solvent with about an 85% loss ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Comparisons of the systems in the United States would benefit from expanding the focus beyond incomparable administrative expenses. For the current period of coronavirus disease 2019, if the trends continue, public Medicare may suffer greater deficits relative to the private Medicare Part C.","Baranoff, Dalit; Baranoff, Etti G; Sager, Thomas W; Shi, Bo",Am J Manag Care,,264
451360,Case 22-2020: A 62-Year-Old Woman with Early Breast Cancer during the Covid-19 Pandemic,2020,"Background. The COVID-19 pandemic leads to several debates regarding the possible risk for healthcare professionals during surgery. SAGES and EAES raised the issue of the transmission of infection through the surgical smoke during laparoscopy. They recommended the use of smoke evacuation devices (SEDs) with CO2 filtering systems. The aim of the present study is to compare the efficacy of different SEDs evaluating the CO2 environmental dispersion in the operating theater. Methods. We prospectively evaluated the data of 4 group of patients on which we used different SEDs or standard trocars: AIRSEAL system (S1 group), a homemade device (S2 group), an AIRSEAL system + homemade device (S3 group), and with standard trocars and without SED (S4 group). Quantitative analysis of CO2 environmental dispersion was carried out associated to the following data in order to evaluate the pneumoperitoneum variations: a preset insufflation pressure, real intraoperative pneumoperitoneum pressure, operative time, total volume of insufflated CO2, and flow rate index. Results. 16 patients were prospectively enrolled. The [CO2] mean value was 711 ppm, 641 ppm, 593 ppm, and 761 ppm in S1, S2, S3, and S4 groups, respectively. The comparison between data of all groups showed statistically significant differences in the measured ambient CO2 concentration. Conclusion. All tested SEDs seem to be useful to reduce the CO2 environmental dispersion respect to the use of standard trocars. The association of AIRSEAL system and a homemade device seems to be the best solution combining an adequate smoke evacuation and a stable pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic surgery.","Bracale, Umberto; Silvestri, Vania; Pontecorvi, Emanuele; Russo, Immacolata; Triassi, Maria; Cassinotti, Elisa; Merola, Giovanni; Montuori, Paolo; Boni, Luigi; Corcione, Francesco",Surg Innov,,264
451622,Formulation of PPAR-gamma agonist as surface modified PLGA nanoparticles for non-invasive treatment of diabetic retinopathy: in vitro and in vivo evidences,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, presents with a broad constellation of both respiratory and nonrespiratory symptoms, although it is primarily considered a respiratory disease. Gastrointestinal symptoms-including nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea-rank chief among these. When coupled with the presence of viral RNA in fecal samples, the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms raises relevant questions regarding whether SARS-CoV-2 can productively infect the upper or lower gastrointestinal tract. Despite the well-documented prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms and the high rate of SARS-CoV-2 fecal RNA shedding, the biological, clinical, and epidemiological relevance of these findings is unclear. Furthermore, the isolation of replication-competent virus from fecal samples has not been reproducibly and rigorously demonstrated. Although SARS-CoV-2 shedding likely occurs in a high proportion of patients, gastrointestinal symptoms affect only a subset of individuals. Herein, we summarize what is known about gastrointestinal symptoms and fecal viral shedding in COVID-19, explore the role of the gut microbiome in other respiratory diseases, speculate on the role of the gut microbiota in COVID-19, and discuss potential future directions. Taking these concepts together, we propose that studying gut microbiota perturbations in COVID-19 will enhance our understanding of the symptomology and pathophysiology of this novel devastating disease.","Brooks, Erin F; Bhatt, Ami S",Cold Spring Harb. mol. case stud,,264

This study aimed to evaluate if and how child and adolescent psychiatric visits to hospital emergency departments (EDs) changed during the pandemic lockdown, which started in Italy on February 24, 2020. METHODS: We examined all ED visits by patients under 18 years of age in the 7 weeks prior to February 24, 2020, and in the subsequent 8 weeks of COVID-19 lockdown at two urban university hospitals, in Turin and Rome, Italy. ED visits during the corresponding periods of 2019 served as a comparison using Poisson regression modeling. The clinician's decision to hospitalize or discharge home the patient after the ED visit was examined as an index of clinical severity. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 lockdown, there was a 72.0% decrease in the number of all pediatric ED visits (3,395) compared with the corresponding period in 2019 (12,128), with a 46.2% decrease in psychiatric visits (50 vs 93). The mean age of psychiatric patients was higher in the COVID-19 period (15.7 vs 14.1 years). No significant changes were found in hospitalization rate or in the prevalence distribution of the primary reason for the psychiatric ED visit (suicidality, anxiety/mood disorders, agitation). CONCLUSIONS: In the first 8 weeks of the COVID-19-induced social lockdown, the number of child and adolescent psychiatric ED visits significantly decreased, with an increase in patient age. This decrease does not appear to be explained by severity-driven self-selection and might be due to a reduction in psychiatric emergencies or to the implementation of alternative ways of managing acute psychopathology.","Davico, Chiara; Marcotulli, Daniele; Lux, Caterina; Calderoni, Dario; Cammisa, Luca; Bondone, Claudia; Rosa-Brusin, Martina; Secci, Ilaria; Porro, Marzia; Campanile, Roberta; Bosia, Chiara; Di Santo, Federica; Terrinoni, Arianna; Ricci, Federica; Amianto, Federico; Urbino, Antonio; Ferrara, Mauro; Vitiello, Benedetto",J. clin. psychiatr,,264

452167,CT Scans of Patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pneumonia,2020,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported a negative psychological and mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This impact is likely to be stronger for people with autism as they are at heightened risk of mental health problems and because the pandemic directly affects social functioning and everyday routines. We therefore examined COVID-19 pandemic-related changes in mental health, the impact of the pandemic on their social life and routines, satisfaction with pandemic-related information and tips, and participants' wishes for guidance. METHODS: We used a mixed-method approach, collecting quantitative and qualitative survey data from adults with and without autism across three European countries: Belgium, the Netherlands, and the UK (N = 1044). RESULTS: We found an increase in depression and anxiety symptoms in response to the pandemic for both the non-autism and the autism group, which was greater for adults with autism. Furthermore, adults with autism showed a greater increase in worries about their pets, work, getting medication and food, and their own safety/security. They felt more relieved from social stress, yet experienced the loss of social contact as difficult. Adults with autism also felt more stressed about the loss of routines. Pleasant changes noted by adults with autism were the increase in solidarity and reduced sensory and social overload. Adults with autism frequently reported problems with cancellation of guidance due to the pandemic and expressed their wish for (more) autism-specific information and advice. LIMITATIONS: Our sample is likely to reflect some degree of selection bias, and longitudinal studies are needed to determine long-term effects. CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight the psychological burden of the pandemic on adults with autism and shed light on how to support them during this COVID-19 pandemic, which is especially important now that the pandemic is likely to have a prolonged course. There is a need for accessible, affordable (continued) support from health services. Guidance may focus on the maintenance of a social network, and adjusting routines to the rapid ongoing changes. Finally, we may learn from the COVID-19 pandemic-related changes experienced as pleasant by adults with autism to build a more autism-friendly society post-pandemic.","Oomen, Danna; Nijhof, Annabel D; Wiersema, Jan R",Mol Autism,,264
453465,Pandemic aspect of dexamethasone: Molecular mechanisms and clinical application,2021,"Objectives: Given finite ICU bed capacity, knowledge of ICU bed utilization during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is critical to ensure future strategies for resource allocation and utilization. We sought to examine ICU census trends in relation to ICU bed capacity during the rapid increase in severe coronavirus disease 2019 cases early during the pandemic. Design: Observational cohort study. Setting: Thirteen geographically dispersed academic medical centers in the United States. Patients/Subjects: We obtained daily ICU censuses from March 26 to June 30, 2020, as well as prepandemic ICU bed capacities. The primary outcome was daily census of ICU patients stratified by coronavirus disease 2019 and mechanical ventilation status in relation to ICU capacity. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Prepandemic overall ICU capacity ranged from 62 to 225 beds (median 109). During the study period, the median daily coronavirus disease 2019 ICU census per hospital ranged from 1 to 84 patients, and the daily ICU census exceeded overall ICU capacity for at least 1 day at five institutions. The number of critically ill patients exceeded ICU capacity for a median (interquartile range) of 17 (12-50) of 97 days at these five sites. All 13 institutions experienced decreases in their noncoronavirus disease ICU population, whereas local coronavirus disease 2019 cases increased. Coronavirus disease 2019 patients reached their greatest proportion of ICU capacity on April 12, 2020, when they accounted for 44% of ICU patients across all participating hospitals. Maximum ICU census ranged from 52% to 289% of overall ICU capacity, with three sites less than 80%, four sites 80-100%, five sites 100-128%, and one site 289%. Conclusions: From March to June 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic led to ICU censuses greater than ICU bed capacity at fives of 13 institutions evaluated. These findings demonstrate the short-term adaptability of U.S. healthcare institutions in redirecting limited resources to accommodate a public health emergency.","Douin, David J; Ward, Michael J; Lindsell, Christopher J; Howell, Michelle P; Hough, Catherine L; Exline, Matthew C; Gong, Michelle N; Aboodi, Michael S; Tenforde, Mark W; Feldstein, Leora R; Stubblefield, William B; Steingrub, Jay S; Prekker, Matthew E; Brown, Samuel M; Peltan, Ithan D; Khan, Akram; Files, D Clark; Gibbs, Kevin W; Rice, Todd W; Casey, Jonathan D; Hager, David N; Qadir, Nida; Henning, Daniel J; Wilson, Jennifer G; Patel, Manish M; Self, Wesley H; Ginde, Adit A",Crit Care Explor,,264

As the industry is preparing for recovery, there is an urgent need for research on cruise consumers’ psychology, in particular, the factors influencing their intention to use cruise services after the pandemic. This study employs theories, namely, the health belief model, trust theory and attitude theory, to investigate consumers’ use intention for cruise services after the pandemic. An online survey was administered to consumers in China’s tourism industry, where 376 responses were received. Subsequently, this study employs structural equation modelling to test its theoretical model consisting of hypotheses. The results show that consumers’ trust is directly influenced by health belief constructs including perceived safety threat, outcome expectation, self-efficacy and cues to action. Next, trust exerts a direct impact on consumers’ attitude and intention to use cruise services. Moreover, this study finds full and partial mediation effects. The findings provide a series of recommendations for cruise operators and policymakers in terms of marketing strategies, service design, public communication and health measures.","Yuen, Kum Fai Cao Yangyi Bai Xiwen Wang Xueqin",Marine Policy,,264

The aim of the present study was to compare characteristics of patients dying with COVID-19 in Italy in the first 'peak' phase of the epidemic and in its second phase. METHODS: Medical charts of patients with COVID-19 who died while in hospital in Italy were reviewed to extract information on pre-existing comorbidities, in-hospital complications, and disease trajectories. The course of the epidemic was classified in two 3-month periods: March-May 2020 and June-August 2020. FINDINGS: Overall, in the Italian population, 34,191 COVID-19 deaths occurred in March-May 2020 and 1,404 in June-August 2020. Patients dying in March-May were significantly younger (80.1 ± 10.6 vs. 82.8 ± 11.1 years, p < 0.001) and less frequently female (41.9% vs. 61.8%, p < 0.001) than those dying in June-August. The medical charts of 3533 patients who died with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in March-May 2020 (10.3% of all deaths occurring in this period) and 203 patients who died in June-August 2020 (14.5% of all deaths occurring in this period) were analysed. Patients who died in March-May 2020, compared to those who died in June-August 2020, had significantly lower rates of multiple comorbidities (3 or more comorbidities: 61.8% vs 74.5%, p = 0.001) and superinfections (15.2% vs. 52.5%, p < 0.001). Treatment patterns also substantially differed in the two study periods, with patients dying in March-May 2020 being less likely to be treated with steroids (41.7% vs. 69.3%, p < 0.001) and more likely to receive antivirals (59.3% vs. 41.4%, p < 0.001). Survival time also largely differed, with patients dying in March-May 2020 showing a shorter time from symptoms onset to death (mean interval: 15.0 vs. 46.6 days, p < 0.001). The differences observed between the two periods remained significant in a multivariate analysis. INTERPRETATION: The clinical characteristics of patients dying with COVID-19 in Italy, their treatment and symptom-to-death survival time have significantly changed overtime. This is probably due to an improved organization and delivery of care and to a better knowledge of disease treatment.","Palmieri, Luigi; Palmer, Katie; Lo Noce, Cinzia; Meli, Paola; Giuliano, Marina; Floridia, Marco; Tamburo de Bella, Manuela; Piccioli, Andrea; Brusaferro, Silvio; Onder, Graziano",Aging clin. exp. res,,264

Subsequently, Van Overmeire (2020) has raised concerns about the validity of our findings, arguing that simply experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic is not sufficient to meet the trauma exposure criterion for a PTSD diagnosis and, consequently, our estimated PTSD prevalence figure was inflated. In this response, we provide (a) an explanation for why the COVID-19 pandemic can be reasonably considered to be a traumatic event, (b) evidence that PTSD in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is a meaningful construct, and (c) an argument for why our estimated prevalence rate is not unreasonably high.","Shevlin, Mark; Hyland, Philip; Karatzias, Thanos",J Trauma Stress,,264
456911,COVID-19 infection in cancer patients: early observations and unanswered questions,2020,"BACKGROUND: People living in group situations or with dementia are more vulnerable to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Older people and those with multimorbidity have higher mortality if they become infected than the general population. However, no systematic study exists of COVID-19-related outcomes in older inpatients in psychiatric units, who comprise people from these high-risk groups. We aimed to describe the period prevalence, demographics, symptoms (and asymptomatic cases), management, and survival outcomes of COVID-19 in the older inpatient psychiatric population and people with young-onset dementia in five National Health Service Trusts in London, UK, from March 1 to April 30, 2020. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we collected demographic data, mental health diagnoses, clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, symptoms, management, and COVID-19-related outcome data of inpatients aged 65 years or older or with dementia who were already inpatients or admitted as inpatients to five London mental health Trusts between March 1 and April 30, 2020, and information about available COVID-19-related resources (ie, testing and personal protective equipment). Patients were determined to have COVID-19 if they had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, or had relevant symptoms indicative of COVID-19, as determined by their treating physician. We calculated period prevalence of COVID-19 and analysed patients' characteristics, treatments, and outcomes. FINDINGS: Of 344 inpatients, 131 (38%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period (period prevalence 38% [95% CI 33-43]). The mean age of patients who had COVID-19 was 75·3 years (SD 8·2); 68 (52%) were women and 47 (36%) from ethnic minority groups. 16 (12%) of 131 patients were asymptomatic and 121 (92%) had one or more disease-related comorbidity. 108 (82%) patients were compulsorily detained. 74 (56%) patients had dementia, of whom 13 (18%) had young-onset dementia. On average, sites received COVID-19 testing kits 4·5 days after the first clinical COVID-19 presentation. 19 (15%) patients diagnosed with COVID-19 died during the study period, and their deaths were determined to be COVID-19 related. INTERPRETATION: Patients in psychiatric inpatient settings who were admitted without known SARS-CoV-2 infection had a high risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 compared with those in the community and had a higher proportion of deaths from COVID-19 than in the community. Implementation of the long-standing policy of parity of esteem for mental health and planning for future COVID-19 waves in psychiatric hospitals is urgent.

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of all TDC insertions or exchanges performed at our centre, between January 2017 and December 2017. Patient demographics, laboratory results and catheter placement information were obtained from electronic records. Immediate technical success, early and late catheter associated complications were collected. Outcomes for TDC inserted with or without fluoroscopy were statistically analysed. RESULTS: A total of 351 TDC insertions and 253 TDC exchanges were performed. Out of 351 TDC insertions, 261 were done with fluoroscopy while 90 were done without. Out of 253 TDC exchanges, 219 were done with fluoroscopy while 34 were done without. For both TDC insertions and exchanges, there were no significant differences in complication rates when done with or without fluoroscopy. Mean duration of catheter patency was longer for TDC inserted without fluoroscopy, after adjusting for site of insertion and presence of previous TDC. CONCLUSIONS: The technique of inserting TDC in the right internal jugular vein (IJV) without fluoroscopy is a safe and effective method in selected patients. This supports the practice of performing the procedure without fluoroscopy, especially in institutions where fluoroscopy facilities are not readily available. This potentially translates into reduced healthcare resources and hospitalisation days, which is particularly valuable in times of limited resources such as the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","Chang, Zi Yun; Wong, Weng Kin; Chan, Yiong Huak; Khan, Behram A; Leo, Christopher Ch",J Vasc Access,,264

458871,Severe COVID-19 patients exhibit an ILC2 NKG2D+ population in their impaired ILC compartment,2020,"COVID-19 is spreading in a global pandemic that is endangering human life and health. Therefore, there is an urgent need to target COVID-19 to find effective treatments for this emerging acute respiratory infection. Viral Papain-Like cysteine protease (PLpro), similar to papain and the cysteine deubiquitinase enzyme, has been a popular target for coronavirus inhibitors, as an indispensable enzyme in the process of coronavirus replication and infection of the host. Combined structure-based virtual screening, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and molecular mechanics/Generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) free energy calculation approaches were utilized for identification of PLpro inhibitors. Four compounds (F403_0159, F112_0109, G805_0497, D754_0006) with diverse chemical scaffolds were retrieved as hits based on docking score and clustering analysis. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the contribution of van der Waals interaction dominated the binding free energies of these compounds, which may be attributed to the hydrophobicity of active site of PLpro from COVID-19. Moreover, all four compounds formed conservative hydrogen bonds with the residues Asp164, Gln269, and Tyr273. We hoped that these four compounds might represent the promising chemical scaffolds for further development of novel PLpro inhibitors against COVID-19.","Pang, Jie; Gao, Shan; Sun, Zengxian; Yang, Guangsheng",Struct Chem,,264

Further, we correlate the effect of fever, gender, age, and time since symptom onset with antibody responses. We observe that total anti-S trimer, anti-RBD, and anti-NP IgG are relatively stable over 6 months of follow-up and anti-S and anti-RBD avidity increases over time, and that fever is associated with higher levels of antibodies. However, neutralizing antibody responses rapidly decay and are strongly associated with declines in IgM levels. Thus, while total antibody against SARS-CoV-2 may persist, functional antibody, particularly IgM, is rapidly lost.

The impact of COVID-19 has not been described so far in a military setting. We therefore report a case series of infected patients in a recruit school in Switzerland and the herein associated challenges. METHODS: Retrospective review of COVID-19 cases among Swiss Armed Forces recruits in the early weeks of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the canton of Ticino, the southernmost canton of Switzerland. Positive cases were defined with two positive PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs. Serological testing was performed with a commercially available kit according to manufacturers' instructions. RESULTS: The first case was likely contaminated while skiing during weekend permission. He became symptomatic 4 days later, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and was put into isolation. He showed complete symptom resolution after 48 hours. Quarantine was ordered for all recruits with close contact in the past 2 days, a total of 55 persons out of 140 in the company. Seven out of nine recruits in one particular quarantine room became mildly symptomatic. SARS-CoV-2 PCR was positive in one of them. Seven days after initial diagnosis, the index patient and the other one from the quarantine retested positive for SARS-CoV-2, although they had been completely asymptomatic for over 96 hours. Serological testing revealed positive for both patients. All others showed negative IgM and IgG. CONCLUSIONS: Young healthy recruits often showed a mild course of COVID-19 with rapid symptom decline but were persistent SARS-CoV-2 carriers. This illustrates how asymptomatic patients may be responsible for covert viral transmission. An early and prolonged establishment of isolation and quarantine for patients and close contacts is essential to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2, especially in the confined space of a military environment.","Baettig, Sascha J; Parini, A; Cardona, I; Morand, G B",,,264

To control the spread of COVID-19, the production of effective vaccines is likely to be one of the best solutions. However, vaccination hesitancy may decrease individuals' willingness to get vaccinated. The Drivers of COVID-19 Vaccination Acceptance Scale (DrVac-COVID19S) was recently developed to help healthcare professionals and researchers better understand vaccination acceptance. The present study examined whether DrVac-COVID19S is measurement invariant across different subgroups (Taiwanese vs. mainland Chinese university students; males vs. females; and health-related program majors vs. non-health-related program majors). Taiwanese (n = 761; mean age = 25.51 years; standard deviation (SD) = 6.42; 63.5% females) and mainland Chinese university students (n = 3145; mean age = 20.72 years; SD = 2.06; 50.2% females) were recruited using an online survey between 5 January and 21 February 2021. Factor structure and measurement invariance of the two DrVac-COVID19S scales (nine-item and 12-item) were tested using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The findings indicated that the DrVac-COVID19S had a four-factor structure and was measurement invariant across the subgroups. The DrVac-COVID19S's four-factor structure was supported by the CFA results is a practical and valid instrument to quickly capture university students' willingness to get COVID-19 vaccination.

Percutaneous tracheostomies are commonplace in long-term intensive care patients, yet little is known about their role in COVID-19, particularly how operator safety is maintained during the procedure. Here, we describe an approach designed to minimize cross-infection of the operators undertaking percutaneous tracheostomies within this subset of patients. Focus should be on non-technical skills, prolonged periods of pre-oxygenation, and minimal ventilation during the procedure to minimize the risk of aerosolization generated from an open breathing system.

However, this is a slow and time-consuming process, especially when done manually. At the same time, the same claims, with some small variations, spread simultaneously across many accounts and even on different platforms.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional multi-methods study; a qualitative scoping exercise and a telephone survey. The target population was COVID-19 trained HCWs from all provinces of PNG. A descriptive analysis of survey responses was conducted alongside a rapid qualitative analysis of interviews and open-ended survey questions. RESULTS: Four key thematic areas were identified; human resources, logistics, HCW attitudes and community attitudes. The survey response rate was 70.3% (407/579). Commonly reported barriers to COVID-19 swabbing were insufficient staff trained (74.0%, n = 301), inadequate staffing in general (64.9 %, n = 264), insufficient supply of personal protective equipment (PPE, 60.9%, n = 248) and no cold chain to store swabs (57.5%, n = 234). Commonly reported enablers to swabbing were increasing community awareness and risk communication (80.8 %, n = 329), consistent and sufficient supplies of PPE (67.8 %, n = 276), increasing surge workforce (63.9 %, n = 260) and having a fridge to store swabs (59.7 %, n = 243). CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive community and HCWs engagement strategy in combination with innovations to improve supply chain are needed to increase COVID-19 swabbing in Papua New Guinea to reach national testing targets.","Smaghi, Bernnedine S; Collins, Julie; Dagina, Rosheila; Hiawalyer, Gilbert; Vaccher, Stefanie; Flint, James; Housen, Tambri",Int. j. infect. dis,,264

The rate was then combined with estimates of the distribution of the generation interval as reconstructed from the literature. RESULTS: Despite the possible unreliability of some official statistics about COVID-19, the spread of the disease appears to be remarkably similar in most European countries, allowing us to estimate an average R0 in Western Europe of 2.2 (95% CI: 1.9-2.6). CONCLUSIONS: The value of R0 for COVID-19 in Western Europe appears to be significantly lower than that in China.

Methodik/Methods 37-year-old man presenting with pneumonia, severe ARDS, requiring mechanical ventilation and acute supportive therapy. Later diagnose of bacterial superinfection with septic shock, persistent high fever (&gt;40 °C) and elevated inflammation markers, non-responsive to wide-spectrum antibiotics. 178 MBq of Ga-68-pentixafor then administered in accordance with the responsible regulatory body after obtaining informed consent. Whole-body imaging followed on a dedicated PET-scanner 1h post-injection. Low-dose CT scans for attenuation correction were acquired (top of the skull to proximal tibias). Ergebnisse/Results CRCX4-PET showed only faint pulmonary uptake in parallel with significantly enhanced, diffuse tracer-uptake in the bone marrow (spine, thorax and pelvis) as well as in the spleen. Increased CXCR4-expression in the pharyngeal/palatine tonsils, CXCR4-positive lymph nodes in the neck/thorax as well as abdominal/inguinal regions was also reported.

473373,Immunoregulation with mTOR inhibitors to prevent COVID-19 severity: A novel intervention strategy beyond vaccines and specific antiviral medicines,2020,"PURPOSE: To assess the accuracy of the intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation based on three methods using artificial intelligence (AI) and one formula using no AI. METHODS: During cataract surgery on 114 eyes, one type of IOL was implanted, calculated with the Hill-RBF 2.0 method. The theoretical postoperative refractions were calculated using the Kane and the Pearl-DGS methods and a vergence based formula (Barrett Universal II, BUII). The differences between the manifest and objective postoperative refractions and the predicted refractions were calculated. The percentage of eyes within ±0.5 D and ±1.0 D prediction error (PE), the mean, and the median absolute errors (MAE and MedAE) were also determined. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 69.48 years; the axial length was between 21.19 and 25.39 mm. The number of eyes within ±0.5/±1.0 D PE was 96/108 (84.21%/94.73%) using the Hill-RBF 2.0 method, 92/107 (80.70%/93.85%) with the Kane method, 91/107 (79.82%/93.85%) with the Pearl-DGS method, and 91/106 (79.82%/92.98%) with the BUII formula, using subjective refraction. With objective refractometric data, PEs were within ±0.5 D in 88 (77.19%), 83 (72.80%), 82 (71.92%), and 80 (70.17%) cases (Hill-RBF, Kane, Pearl-DGS, BUII, respectively). MAE and MedAE were also best with the Hill-RBF 2.0 method (0.3 D; 0.18 D). CONCLUSION: Better accuracy of PE might be obtained by the Hill-RBF 2.0 method compared with BUII. The Kane and Pearl-DGS methods showed similar accuracy when compared with BUII.","Nemeth, Gabor; Kemeny-Beke, Adam; Modis, Laszlo",Eur J Ophthalmol,,264

474999,COVID-19 infection in patients with sickle cell disease,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To review evidence on routinely prescribed drugs in the UK that could upregulate or downregulate ACE2 and potentially affect COVID-19 disease. DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCE: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library and Web of Science. STUDY SELECTION: Any design with animal or human models examining a currently prescribed UK drug compared with a control, placebo or sham group, and reporting an effect on ACE2 level, activity or gene expression. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science and OpenGrey from inception to 1 April 2020. Methodological quality was assessed using the SYstematic Review Centre for Laboratory animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) risk-of-bias tool for animal studies and Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for human studies. RESULTS: We screened 3360 titles and included 112 studies with 21 different drug classes identified as influencing ACE2 activity. Ten studies were in humans and one hundred and two were in animal models None examined ACE2 in human lungs. The most frequently examined drugs were angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (n=55) and ACE inhibitors (ACE-I) (n=22). More studies reported upregulation than downregulation with ACE-I (n=22), ARBs (n=55), insulin (n=8), thiazolidinedione (n=7) aldosterone agonists (n=3), statins (n=5), oestrogens (n=5) calcium channel blockers (n=3) glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists (n=2) and Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (n=2). CONCLUSIONS: There is an abundance of the academic literature and media reports on the potential of drugs that could attenuate or exacerbate COVID-19 disease. This is leading to trials of repurposed drugs and uncertainty among patients and clinicians concerning continuation or cessation of prescribed medications. Our review indicates that the impact of currently prescribed drugs on ACE2 has been poorly studied in vivo, particularly in human lungs where the SARS-CoV-2 virus appears to enact its pathogenic effects. We found no convincing evidence to justify starting or stopping currently prescribed drugs to influence outcomes of COVID-19 disease.","Dambha-Miller, Hajira; Albasri, Ali; Hodgson, Sam; Wilcox, Christopher R; Khan, Shareen; Islam, Nazrul; Little, Paul; Griffin, Simon J",BMJ Open,,264

In radiation therapy (RT), professional and social interactions are highly important to maintaining team culture and effective patient care. Continuing Professional Development (CPD) is also an integral part of maintaining professional and personal competence and growth for healthcare professionals. This article examines the rationale for and methods of swiftly adapting a robust CPD program and training calendar to an online offering for radiation therapists (RTs) at the Princess Alexandra Hospital Radiation Oncology Department, Brisbane, Australia. Reasons for the change, how it was achieved quickly, and the opportunity to build resilience in the staff group are discussed. Successes and challenges of achieving meaningful change in a short timeframe are described, ensuring RTs maintained access to both CPD and social support during the crisis. Initial feedback suggested a positive response from RTs, but the situation remains dynamic and will need to be monitored and adapted as the pandemic continues.","Besson, Jacqueline; McNamara, Clare; Brown, Elizabeth",J.

The COVID-19 has created a negative impact on the country’s economy but has positivity over the atmospheric resources. The levels of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and UV aerosol index were assessed using satellite images for the two different phases. The obtained results can be interpreted and can be substantiated with the lockdown effect due to the COVID -19 pandemic. The pollutants are mostly emitted from anthropogenic sources like vehicular emissions, industrial emissions, power plants, construction works, commercial and institutional places. It was evident that the levels of carbon monoxide, nitrous dioxide and aerosols levels have drastically decreased during the lockdown period. Hence, it can be concluded that COVID-19 has cleaned the atmospheric pollution as well as climate change scenario and nature on its own. © 2021 Technoscience Publications.

We developed a point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) first approach to patients requiring echocardiography and describe our workflow and findings. METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective analysis of all POCUS studies performed on critically ill patients with COVID-19. Sonography was performed by intensivists, uploaded and archived, and rapidly reviewed by echocardiographers. We evaluated each study based on the number of views obtained. Additionally, we provide a description of the workflow during the COVID-19 surge at a tertiary care hospital in New York City. RESULTS: Fifty patients had POCUS studies performed by intensivists and reviewed by echocardiographers obviating the need for sonographer-performed studies. Of the 48 cardiac POCUS studies, 17% of patients had 4 of 4 standard views available while 53% had 3 of 4 standard views. The parasternal long-axis view was obtained on 81%, subxiphoid view on 79%, apical 4-chamber view on 71%, and parasternal short-axis view on 63% of patients.

480471,Ultra-Fast Label-Free Serum Metabolic Diagnosis of Coronary Heart Disease via a Deep Stabilizer,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious illness that spreads rapidly through human-to-human transmission. On March 5, the government of Palestine declared a state of emergency in order to curb the spread of the virus, a declaration that it extended for a fifth time on July 5th. The degree to which a population complies with corresponding safety measures is surely affected by the people's knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) towards the disease. To explore this hypothesis, we gathered data from 1,731 Palestinians between April 19thand May 1st, 2020 through a KAP questionnaire. The participant pool represented a stratified sample of Palestinians living across a number of governorates in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, with 36.5% from Gaza and (63.5%) from the West Bank. Gender was almost equally distributed within the sample with (51%) men respondents and (49%) women respondent. The questionnaire included 17 questions about participants' knowledge and awareness of COVID-19, 17 questions regarding the safety measures they had taken in the wake of the outbreak and 3 questions asking them to assess the efficacy of the government's response to the pandemic. Our data shows that 79% of the respondents have good awareness about transmission of the virus, 55.6% were knowledgeable of the symptoms exhibited by an infected individual, 81% were aware of the preventative measures and 82% demonstrated awareness of the risk groups. Most participants complied with preventative measures (77%) and 62% the study participants agreed that stricter measures have to be enforced by the government to limit the spread of the virus. Our study revealed that younger participants and people with higher educational level demonstrated more awareness of the virus. Also, Women were reported to be more aware of preventative measures and to have complied more with good practices. We report that residents of the West Bank have complied more with the right practices when compared to residents of Gaza. Based on the results of this study, we conclude that health education programs aimed at improving the public's understanding of COVID-19 are important in helping the population maintain appropriate practices and should be target people with lower educational level, and that findings such as those discussed in this report may provide valuable feedback to lawmakers working to stop the spread of the virus.","Qutob, Nouar; Awartani, Faisal",PLoS One,,264

Methods: We searched seven databases, three preprint platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google from December 1, 2019, to August 5, 2021, to collect evidence of remdesivir, glucocorticoid, and IVIG which were used in children and adolescents with COVID-19 or MIS-C. Results: A total of six cohort studies and one case series study were included in this systematic review. In terms of remdesivir, the meta-analysis of single-arm cohort studies have shown that, after the treatment, 37.1% (95%CI, 0.0% to 74.5%) experienced adverse events, 5.9% (95%CI, 1.5% to 10.2%) died, 37.2% (95%CI, 0% to 76.0%) needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or invasive mechanical ventilation. As for glucocorticoids, the results of the meta-analysis showed that the fixed-effect summary odds ratio for the association with mortality was 2.79 (95%CI, 0.13 to 60.87), and the mechanical ventilation rate was 3.12 (95%CI, 0.80 to 12.08) for glucocorticoids compared with the control group. In terms of IVIG, the two included cohort studies showed that for MIS-C patients with more severe clinical symptoms, IVIG combined with methylprednisolone could achieve better clinical efficacy than IVIG alone. Conclusions: Overall, the current evidence in the included studies is insignificant and of low quality. It is recommended to conduct high-quality randomized controlled trials of remdesivir, glucocorticoids, and IVIG in children and adolescents with COVID-19 or MIS-C to provide substantial evidence for the development of guidelines.","Wang, Zijun; Zhao, Siya; Tang, Yuyi; Wang, Zhili; Shi, Qianling; Dang, Xiangyang; Gan, Lidan; Peng, Shuai; Li, Weiguo; Zhou, Qi; Li, Qinyuan; Mafiana, Joy James; Cortes, Rafael Gonzalez; Luo, Zhengxiu; Liu, Enmei; Chen, Yaolong",,,264
480978,Embolic abducens palsy and central retinal artery occlusion in a patient with COVID-19,2021,"COVID-19 vastly disrupted education across the globe, creating unique challenges for health professions education (HPE) programs. While in some instances, COVID was perceived to serve as a potential driving force for transformative change in HPE through necessary ?disruptive innovation?, a number of challenges have been identified, particularly for pharmacy education in countries as diverse as Japan, Nigeria, the United States, and United Kingdom. Worldwide adoption of online education in response to the pandemic's disruption need careful and long-term evaluation to ensure that adequate learner acquisition of skills-based and didactic curriculum occurred during this time. Nowhere is this need more urgent than for curriculum associated with interprofessional pre-matriculation programs. In 2018, we created an interdisciplinary, one-week-long pre-matriculation program to help incoming pharmacy students be adequately prepared for the rigors of a Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) program. In summer 2020, we modified and expanded this pre-matriculation program by adding primers introducing interprofessional education, and cross-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary aspects related to pharmacy school and conducted a case-controlled, retrospective, single-blinded (blinded to the teaching faculty) study analysis through a comparison of learning metrics between 2019 and 2020. The two-week-long virtual program, co-taught by ten faculty members, was offered for six hours daily during the summer of 2020 in the week preceding orientation week for first professional year students in our Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) program. Case Based Learning and aspects of Team Based Learning were incorporated to engage twenty-two pre-matriculation students enrolled for our Doctor of Pharmacy program. This virtual program was designed to overcome diversity in pre-requisite course content and identify and address gaps in students? abilities to relate foundational science knowledge with pharmacy subjects. The following subjects were included: cardiovascular, neuro, and renal pathophysiology and pharmacology, and skills-based courses such as introduction to simulation, clinical decision making, interprofessional education, graduate writing. The third area we focused on included emotional and mental health and resiliency in the current pandemic. Mixed method evaluation was used including comparing student perceptions of their learning on a twenty-question survey instrument and comparison of the post-activity quiz data. Seventy-seven percent of the attending students from 2020 agreed and 22 percent strongly agreed that the virtual program helped them connect the dots between pathophysiology and pharmacology and pharmacology and skills-based courses such as interprofessional education. Post-activity quiz results did not show any significant difference between the two cohorts suggesting that the online learning environment was at least as effective as the in-person environment. The major limitation was the small class size, paucity of time for specific topics, and familiarity with technology.","Malhotra, Ashim",The FASEB Journal,,264

482274,Mild COVID-19 despite autoantibodies to type I IFNs in Autoimmune-Polyendocrine-Syndrome Type 1 (APS-1),2021,"Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention has implemented an active comprehensive surveillance project of acute respiratory infections in adults in Shanghai, including influenza like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). By testing and identifying a variety of respiratory pathogens, it was found that influenza viruses were the main pathogens in 172 ILI cases in 2019. The positive rates of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus, influenza A (H3N2) virus and influenza B virus Victoria lineage were 30.81%, 14.53% and 30.55%, respectively. The positive detection of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus peaked in the first quarter. The positive rate of enterovirus/human rhinovirus was 6.40%, with a positive detection peak in the third quarter, while the positive rate of adenovirus was 4.65% with a positive detection peak in the second quarter of the year. Two human coronavirus (HCoV)-OC43 positive samples, 1 HCoV-HKU1 positive sample and 1 HCoV-NL63 positive sample were detected, respectively, and no HCoV-229E positive sample was detected. The detection rate of Staphylococcus aureus was 17.44%, and the detection rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae was 9.88%. Influenza viruses were also the main pathogens in 1 447 SARI cases. The positive rates of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus, influenza A (H3N2) virus and influenza B virus Victoria lineage were 5.46%, 1.73% and 0.30%, respectively. The positive detection of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus (17.50%) peaked in the first quarter. The total positive detection rate of enterovirus/human rhinovirus was 2.97%, the positive detection peaked in the first quarter. The positive rate of Mycoplasma pneumoniae was 3.25% and the positive rate of Legionella was 1.04%. 5 HCoV-229E positive samples, 10 HCoV-OC43 positive samples, 7 HCoV-HKU1 positive samples and 6 HCoV-NL63 positive samples were detected. Eight strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 4 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 3 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae were detected after cultures. By implementing the active surveillance, we not only detected a case of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in time, but also preliminary understood the pathogenic spectrum characteristics and seasonality of ILI and SARI in Shanghai. In recent years, the surveillance methods have been continuously improved and the number of sentinel hospitals has increased gradually. In particular, for the response to COVID-19, the Surveillance Information Reporting System of Acute Respiratory Infection based on HIS system has been promoted to cover the whole city, which might lay a foundation for the active surveillance and early warning of emerging infectious diseases in the future.","Chen, J; Zheng, Y X; Kong, D C; Wu, H Y; Yuan, Z A; Wu, F",Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,,264

Recently, a study has reported that coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, is associated with a decrease in albumin level, an increase in NETosis, blood coagulation, and cytokine level. Here, we present drug-loaded albumin nanoparticles as a therapeutic agent to resolve the clinical outcomes observed in severe SARS-CoV-2 patients. PEGylated nanoparticle albumin-bound (PNAB) was used to promote prolonged bioactivity of steroidal ginsenoside saponins, PNAB-Rg6 and PNAB-Rgx365. Our data indicate that the application of PNAB-steroidal ginsenoside can effectively reduce histone H4 and NETosis-related factors in the plasma, and alleviate SREBP2-mediated systemic inflammation in the PBMCs of SARS-CoV-2 ICU patients. The engineered blood vessel model confirmed that these drugs are effective in suppressing blood clot formation and vascular inflammation. Moreover, the animal model experiment showed that these drugs are effective in promoting the survival rate by alleviating tissue damage and cytokine storm. Altogether, our findings suggest that these PNAB-steroidal ginsenoside drugs have potential applications in the treatment of symptoms associated with severe SARS-CoV-2 patients, such as coagulation and cytokine storm.","Park, Hee Ho; Kim, Hyelim; Lee, Han Sol; Seo, Eun U; Kim, Ji-Eun; Lee, Jee-Hyun; Mun, Yong-Hyeon; Yoo, So-Yeol; An, Jiseon; Yun, Mi-Young; Kang, Nae-Won; Kim, Dae-Duk; Na, Dong Hee; Hong, Kyung Soo; Jang, Jong Geol; Ahn, June Hong; Bae, Jong-Sup; Song, Gyu Yong; Lee, Jae-Young; Kim, Hong Nam; Lee, Wonhwa",Biomaterials,,264

487071,Probiotics and COVID-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection affects about half of the world's population and can lead to multiple complications if left untreated. Testing for H. pylori infection in appropriate patients with prompt treatment followed by the testing of eradication is the standard of care in the United States. Active Duty Service members (ADSMs) in the U.S. military are a unique patient population that may be at higher risk for acquiring H. pylori infection given frequent deployments to developing countries. Noninvasive diagnostic strategies include the urea breath test, the stool antigen test, and serologic testing, which include H. pylori immunoglobulin M (IgM), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. Among noninvasive methods, the least sensitive is serology, and although there is clinical utility in testing for H. pylori IgG antibodies, H. pylori IgA or IgM antibodies have limited clinical utility. Despite this, H. pylori IgA and IgM antibodies are still widely ordered across the Military Health System. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order to determine how frequently this testing is being ordered and the associated cost, we conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study of H. pylori serologic testing utilization in the MHS from October 2015 to September 2018 in adult patients using the MHS Data Repository. All H. pylori IgM, IgA, and IgG antibodies, H. pylori stool antigen tests, and H. pylori urea breath tests were queried during this time period across all ADSMs, retirees, and ADSM dependents for all adults. Cost information was obtained from LabCorp, and the institutional price used for cost analysis was the same throughout all military treatment facilities in the Department of Defense (DOD). RESULTS: We discovered that over a 3-yr period, 1,916 H. pylori IgA and 2,492 IgM antibodies were ordered. In total, the DOD spent close to $400,000 on antibody-based testing for H. pylori not accounting for indirect associated costs like personnel, supplies, repeat testing, as well as the costs of delayed diagnosis and associated complications. CONCLUSION: H. pylori IgM and IgA have limited clinical utility, are inaccurate, and are costly to maintain, especially when more accurate alternative tests are available. Based on our analysis, we strongly recommend the removal of the H. pylori IgA and IgM serologic tests throughout the DOD in order to improve the efficiency and quality of care for patients suspected of having an H. pylori infection. Further research is needed to determine how these tests are ordered, how providers are responding to the results of the serologic tests, and if noninvasive testing is being ordered appropriately.","Pak, Kevin; Junga, Zachary; Mertz, Andrew; Singla, Manish",Mil. med,,264

As with exposure to many viruses, individuals with pre-existing, compromised immune systems may be at increased risk of developing severe symptoms and/or dying because of (SARS-CoV-2) infection. To learn more about such individuals, we conducted a search and review of published reports on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with pre-existing, compromised immune systems. Here we present our review of patients who possess pre-existing primary antibody deficiency (PAD) and those who are organ transplant recipients on maintenance immunosuppressants. Our review indicates different clinical outcomes for the patients with pre-existing PAD, depending on the underlying causes. For organ transplant recipients, drug-induced immune suppression alone does not appear to enhance COVID-19 mortality risk - rather, advanced age, comorbidities, and the development of secondary complications appears required.","Corse, Tanner; Dayan, Linda; Kersten, Sydney; Battaglia, Fortunato; Terlecky, Stanley R; Han, Zhiyong",Int J Med Sci,,264

Taking advantage of this natural experiment, we examined how the proactive closure of elementary schools affected various outcomes related to children and family well-being. To identify the causal effects of the school closure, we exploited the discontinuity in the probability of not going to school at a certain threshold of age in months and conducted fuzzy regression discontinuity analyses. The data are from a large-scale online survey of mothers whose firstborn children were aged 4 to 10 years. The results revealed a large increase in children's weight and in mothers' anxiety over how to raise their children. On the outcomes related to marital relationships, such as the incidence of domestic violence and the quality of marriage, we did not find statistically significant changes. These findings together suggest that school closures could have large unintended detrimental effects on non-academic outcomes among children.","Takaku, Reo; Yokoyama, Izumi",J Public Econ,,264

Owing to uncertainties and crisis amid the pandemic, as an emergency announcement, the World Health Organization (WHO) solicits the help of health authorities, especially, researchers to conduct in-depth research on the evolution and treatment of COVID-19. This paper proposes an integer-valued time series model to analyze the series of COVID-19 cases in Mauritius wherein the corresponding innovation term accommodates for covariate specification. In this set-up, sanitary curfew followed by sanitization and sensitization campaigns, time factor and safe shopping guidelines have been tested as the most significant variables, unlike climatic conditions. The over-dispersion estimates and the serial auto-correlation parameter are also statistically significant. This study also confirms the presence of some unobservable effects like the pathological genesis of the novel coronavirus and environmental factors which contribute to rapid propagation of the zoonotic virus in the community. Based on the proposed COM-Poisson mixture models, we could predict the number of COVID-19 cases in Mauritius. The forecasting results provide satisfactory mean squared errors. Such findings will subsequently encourage the policymakers to implement strict precautionary measures in terms of constant upgrading of the current health care and wellness system and re-enforcement of sanitary obligations.","Mamode Khan, Naushad; Soobhug, Ashwinee Devi; Heenaye-Mamode Khan, Maleika",PLoS One,,264

The combination of rapid separating technique and multiple individual microneedle arrays provides the combined ability to efficiently deliver insulin into the skin within seconds and to independently control insulin release kinetics. In addition, the diabetic rats with a traditional breakfast-lunch-dinner lifestyle exhibit obvious intraday glucose fluctuations, while the hypoglycemic experiments indicate that the IMP is capable of simultaneous bolus and sustained insulin delivery to closely match the glucose rise that occurs in response to meals and efficiently minimize excessive fluctuations, suggesting the potential of this new transdermal insulin delivery system as substitutes for multiple daily injections.","Chen, Bo Zhi; Zhang, Li Qin; Xia, Yi Yun; Zhang, Xiao Peng; Guo, Xin Dong",Sci.

Here, we present the oropharyngeal microbiota characteristics identified by shotgun metagenomic sequencing analyses of oropharynx swab specimens from 31 COVID-19 patients, 29 influenza B patients, and 28 healthy controls. Our results revealed a distinct oropharyngeal microbiota composition in the COVID-19 patients, characterized by enrichment of opportunistic pathogens such as Veillonella and Megasphaera and depletion of Pseudopropionibacterium, Rothia, and Streptococcus. Based on the relative abundance of the oropharyngeal microbiome, we built a microbial classifier to distinguish COVID-19 patients from flu patients and healthy controls with an AUC of 0.889, in which Veillonella was identified as the most prominent biomarker for COVID-19 group. Several members of the genus Veillonella, especially Veillonella parvula which was highly enriched in the oropharynx of our COVID-19 patients, were also overrepresented in the BALF of COVID-19 patients, indicating that the oral cavity acts as a natural reservoir for pathogens to induce co-infections in the lungs of COVID-19 patients. We also found the increased ratios of Klebsiella sp., Acinetobacter sp., and Serratia sp. were correlated with both disease severity and elevated systemic inflammation markers (neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, NLR), suggesting that these oropharynx microbiota alterations may impact COVID-19 severity by influencing the inflammatory response. Moreover, the oropharyngeal microbiome of COVID-19 patients exhibited a significant enrichment in amino acid metabolism and xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism. In addition, all 26 drug classes of antimicrobial resistance genes were detected in the COVID-19 group, and were significantly enriched in critical cases. In conclusion, we found that oropharyngeal microbiota alterations and functional differences were associated with COVID-19 severity.","Ma, Shengli; Zhang, Fan; Zhou, Fengxia; Li, Hui; Ge, Wenyu; Gan, Rui; Nie, Huan; Li, Biao; Wang, Yindong; Wu, Meng; Li, Duo; Wang, Dongmei; Wang, Zheng; You, Yuhong; Huang, Zhiwei",Signal Transduct Target Ther,,264

No therapies have been shown effective with the exception of dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid that was recently proved to be the first life-saving drug in this disease. Remarkably, around 20 % of infected people develop a severe form of COVID-19, giving rise to respiratory and multi-organ failures requiring subintensive and intensive care interventions. This phenomenon is due to an excessive immune response that damages pulmonary alveoli, leading to a cytokine and chemokine storm with systemic effects. Indeed glucocorticoids' role in regulating this immune response is controversial, and they have been used in clinical practice in a variety of countries, even without a previous clear consensus on their evidence-based benefit.","Solinas, Cinzia; Perra, Laura; Aiello, Marco; Migliori, Edoardo; Petrosillo, Nicola",Cytokine Growth Factor Rev,,264

OBJECTIVES: To explore current data and hypothesis on the possible sites of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the male reproduction system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the current literature to describe: a) the evidences on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (AC2E) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) expression in the testes, accessory glands (including prostate) and the urinary tract; b) other coronaviruses' (SARS and MERS) ability to infect these sites. RESULTS: The co-expression of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes was reported in spermatogonial stem cells, elongated spermatids, in at least a small percentage of prostate hillock cells and in renal tubular cells. Testicular damage was described in autopsies of SARS patients, without evidence of the virus in the specimens. Prostate is a known infection site for MERS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in urines. DISCUSSION: There are still al lot of open questions on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the male reproductive tract. The presence of receptors is not a proof that the testis provides a site for viral infection and it is still unknown if SARS-CoV-2 is capable to pass the blood-testis barrier. The possibility of a prostate involvement has not been investigated yet: we have no data, but theoretically it cannot be excluded. Moreover, the RNA detected in semen could have been just a residual of urinary shedding. CONCLUSION: Opening our prospective beyond the testis could be the key to better understand the possibility of a semen-related viral transmission as well as COVID19 short and long-term effects on male reproductive function.","Massarotti, Claudia; Garolla, Andrea; Maccarini, Elena; Scaruffi, Paola; Stigliani, Sara; Anserini, Paola; Foresta, Carlo",Androl.

Twenty-eight (14.14%) had mild disease, 62 (31.31%) had moderate disease, 64 (32.32%) had severe disease, and 44 (22.22%) had critical disease. The G2 value assessed the contribution of each collected value to decision tree building. On this basis, SpO2 (%) with a cut point at 92 was chosen for the optimal first split. Therefore, the decision tree was built using values maximizing G2 and LogWorth. After the tree was built, the correspondence between inputs and outcomes was validated. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a machine learning-based tool that is easy to understand and apply. It provides good discrimination in stratifying confirmed and unconfirmed COVID-19 patients with different prognoses in every context.

495375,"Hypoxemia in COVID-19; Comment on: ""The neuroinvasive potential of SARS - CoV2 may play a role in the respiratory failure of COVID-19 patients""",2020,"This study explored the association between the five key air pollutants (Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Particulate Matter (PM2.5, PM10), and Carbon Monoxide (CO)) and COVID-19 incidences in India. The COVID-19 confirmed cases, air pollution concentration and meteorological variables (temperature, wind speed, surface pressure) for district and city scale were obtained for 2019 and 2020. The location-based air pollution observations were converted to a raster surface using interpolation. The deaths and positive cases are reported so far were found highest in Mumbai (436 and 11394), followed by Ahmedabad (321 and 4991), Pune (129 and 2129), Kolkata (99 and 783), Indore (83 and 1699), Jaipur (53 and 1111), Ujjain (42 and 201), Surat (37 and 799), Vadodara (31 and 400), Chennai (23 and 2647), Bhopal (22 and 652), Thane (21 and 1889), respectively. Unlike the other studies, this study has not found any substantial association between air pollution and COVID-19 incidences at the district level. Considering the number of confirmed cases, the coefficient of determination (R2) values estimated as 0.003 for PM2.5, 0.002 for PM10 and SO2, 0.001 for CO, and 0.0002 for NO2, respectively. This suggests an absolute no significant association between air pollution and COVID-19 incidences (both confirmed cases and death) in India. The same association was observed for the number of deaths as well. For COVID-19 confirmed cases, none of the five pollutants has exhibited any statistically significant association. Additionally, except the wind speed, the climate variables have no produced any statistically significant association with the COVID-19 incidences.","Maiti, Arabinda; Chakraborti, Suman; Pramanik, Suvamoy; Sannigrahi, Srikanta",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15777v1.pdf,264

498879,Schizophrenia patients with poor clinical insight report less subjective memory problems,2021,"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are a focus in vaccine and therapeutic design to counteract severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its variants. Here, we combined B cell sorting with single-cell VDJ and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and mAb structures to characterize B cell responses against SARS-CoV-2. We show that the SARS-CoV-2-specific B cell repertoire consists of transcriptionally distinct B cell populations with cells producing potently neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) localized in two clusters that resemble memory and activated B cells. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of selected nAbs from these two clusters complexed with SARS-CoV-2 spike trimers show recognition of various receptor-binding domain (RBD) epitopes. One of these mAbs, BG10-19, locks the spike trimer in a closed conformation to potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2, the recently arising mutants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, and SARS-CoV and cross-reacts with heterologous RBDs. Together, our results characterize transcriptional differences among SARS-CoV-2-specific B cells and uncover cross-neutralizing Ab targets that will inform immunogen and therapeutic design against coronaviruses.","Scheid, Johannes F; Barnes, Christopher O; Eraslan, Basak; Hudak, Andrew; Keeffe, Jennifer R; Cosimi, Lisa A; Brown, Eric M; Muecksch, Frauke; Weisblum, Yiska; Zhang, Shuting; Delorey, Toni; Woolley, Ann E; Ghantous, Fadi; Park, Sung-Moo; Phillips, Devan; Tusi, Betsabeh; Huey-Tubman, Kathryn E; Cohen, Alexander A; Gnanapragasam, Priyanthi N P; Rzasa, Kara; Hatziioanno, Theodora; Durney, Michael A; Gu, Xiebin; Tada, Takuya; Landau, Nathaniel R; West, Anthony P; Rozenblatt-Rosen, Orit; Seaman, Michael S; Baden, Lindsey R; Graham, Daniel B; Deguine, Jacques; Bieniasz, Paul D; Regev, Aviv; Hung, Deborah; Bjorkman, Pamela J; Xavier, Ramnik J",Cell,,264

Prisons are epicenters for COVID-19 transmission, including to the community. High rates of preexisting health conditions, limited access to quality health care, and inability to social distance make it impossible to reduce the impact of COVID-19 in prisons. Due to a history of compounded social determinants, incarcerated populations are disproportionately composed of people of color and people with stigmatized behavioral health disorders. Rapid decarceration is needed to promote health equity. Historical mass decarceration events demonstrate feasibility to rapidly release large groups of people while maintaining public safety. Iran and Ireland have released substantial portions of their prison populations by transitioning people to home confinement. In the United States and Uganda, some jurisdictions have reduced new incarcerations through policies that decrease arrests. These policies must be globally expanded to contain the epidemic, and its potential health consequences, while addressing health equity.","Henry, Brandy F",Health Educ Behav,,264

500745,Development and validation of a risk stratification model for screening suspected cases of COVID-19 in China,2020,"The paper is devoted to a compartmental epidemiological model of infection progression in a heterogeneous population which consists of two groups with high disease transmission (HT) and low disease transmission (LT) potentials. Final size and duration of epidemic, the total and current maximal number of infected individuals are estimated depending on the structure of the population. It is shown that with the same basic reproduction number R0 in the beginning of epidemic, its further progression depends on the ratio between the two groups. Therefore, fitting the data in the beginning of epidemic and the determination of R0 are not sufficient to predict its long time behaviour. Available data on the Covid-19 epidemic allows the estimation of the proportion of the HT and LT groups. Estimated structure of the population is used for the investigation of the influence of vaccination on further epidemic development. The result of vaccination strongly depends on the proportion of vaccinated individuals between the two groups. Vaccination of the HT group acts to stop the epidemic and essentially decreases the total number of infected individuals at the end of epidemic and the current maximal number of infected individuals while vaccination of the LT group only acts to protect vaccinated individuals from further infection.","Volpert, Vitaly Banerjee Malay Sharma Swarnali",Ecological Complexity,,264

501173,Parsonage-turner syndrome associated with SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) infection,2020,"While COVID-19 continues to spread across the globe, diligent efforts are made to understand its attributes and dynamics to help develop treatment and prevention measures. The paradox pertaining to children being the least affected by severe illness poses exciting opportunities to investigate potential protective factors. In this paper, we propose that childhood vaccination against pertussis (whooping cough) might play a non-specific protective role against COVID-19 through heterologous adaptive responses in this young population. Pertussis is a vaccine-preventable infectious disease of the respiratory tract and it shares many similarities with COVID-19 including transmission and clinical features. Although pertussis is caused by a bacterium (Bordetella pertussis) while COVID-19 is a viral infection (SARS-CoV-2), previous data showed that cross-reactivity and heterologous adaptive responses can be seen with unrelated agents of highly divergent groups, such as between bacteria and viruses. While we build the arguments of this hypothesis on theoretical and previous empirical evidence, we also outline suggested lines of research from different fields to test its credibility. Besides, we highlight some concerns that may arise when attempting to consider such an approach as a potential public health preventive intervention against COVID-19.","Ismail, Mohamad Bachar; Omari, Sarah Al; Rafei, Rayane; Dabboussi, Fouad; Hamze, Monzer",Med Hypotheses,,264

501847,COVID-19: Is a paradigm change to be expected in health care and transfusion medicine?,2020,"This study detected the Coronavirus (COVID-19) disease by implementing artificial learning methods. Coronavirus disease occurs in the lungs and can cause death. The detection process was performed on chest Computed Tomography (CT) images. The training process was implemented by using 32x32 patches that were obtained from CT images. This study includes three phases: The first phase classifies patches by the SVM algorithm without implementing the feature extraction methods. The second phase extracts features on patches by using Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Grey Level Run Length Matrix (GLRLM), Grey-Level Size Zone Matrix (GLSZM), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) methods and classifies the features extracted. The third phase uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) method to classify the patches. 10-fold cross-validation is implemented in the classification process. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, and F-score metrics measure the classification performance. The highest classification accuracy was achieved as 99.15% by the CNN method during the training process. The classification structure, which has the highest classification accuracy, was used during the test performance and had 80.21% mean sensitivity rate, which is the COVID detection performance, on 727 test images. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

METHODS: Data were retrospectively obtained from consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to 13 Cardiology Units in Italy, from March 1st to April 9th, 2020, and followed until in-hospital death, discharge, or April 23rd, 2020. The association of baseline variables with computed tomography-confirmed PE was investigated by Cox hazards regression analysis. The relationship between D-dimer levels and PE incidence was evaluated using restricted cubic splines models. RESULTS: The study included 689 patients (67.3 ± 13.2 year-old, 69.4% males), of whom 43.6% were non-invasively ventilated and 15.8% invasively. 52 (7.5%) had PE over 15 (9-24) days of follow-up. Compared with those without PE, these subjects had younger age, higher BMI, less often heart failure and chronic kidney disease, more severe cardio-pulmonary involvement, and higher admission D-dimer [4344 (1099-15,118) vs. 818.5 (417-1460) ng/mL, p < 0.001]. They also received more frequently darunavir/ritonavir, tocilizumab and ventilation support. Furthermore, they faced more bleeding episodes requiring transfusion (15.6% vs. 5.1%, p < 0.001) and non-significantly higher in-hospital mortality (34.6% vs. 22.9%, p = 0.06). In multivariate regression, only D-dimer was associated with PE (HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.13-2.62; p = 0.01). The relation between D-dimer concentrations and PE incidence was linear, without inflection point. Only two subjects had a baseline D-dimer < 500 ng/mL. CONCLUSIONS: PE occurs in a sizable proportion of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The implications of bleeding events and the role of D-dimer in this population need to be clarified.","Ameri, Pietro; Inciardi, Riccardo M; Di Pasquale, Mattia; Agostoni, Piergiuseppe; Bellasi, Antonio; Camporotondo, Rita; Canale, Claudia; Carubelli, Valentina; Carugo, Stefano; Catagnano, Francesco; Danzi, Giambattista; Dalla Vecchia, Laura; Giovinazzo, Stefano; Gnecchi, Massimiliano; Guazzi, Marco; Iorio, Anita; La Rovere, Maria Teresa; Leonardi, Sergio; Maccagni, Gloria; Mapelli, Massimo; Margonato, Davide; Merlo, Marco; Monzo, Luca; Mortara, Andrea; Nuzzi, Vincenzo; Piepoli, Massimo; Porto, Italo; Pozzi, Andrea; Provenzale, Giovanni; Sarullo, Filippo; Sinagra, Gianfranco; Tedino, Chiara; Tomasoni, Daniela; Volterrani, Maurizio; Zaccone, Gregorio; Lombardi, Carlo Mario; Senni, Michele; Metra, Marco",Clin. res. cardiol,,264

In the preanalytical phase, the dominant source of error is tissue quality, especially the different intervals between sample collection and processing or fixation (and its duration) and specifically the interval between death and sample collection in autopsies. However, this information is found in less than half of the studies (e.g., in only 42% of autopsy studies). Our own experience and first studies prove the significantly higher sensitivity and specificity of RNA-based detection methods compared to antigen or protein detection by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence. Detection by electron microscopy is time consuming and difficult to interpret. CONCLUSIONS: Different methods are available for the detection of SARS-CoV­2 in tissue. Currently, RNA detection by RT-PCR is the method of choice. However, extensive validation studies and method harmonization are not available and are absolutely necessary.","von Stillfried, Saskia; Boor, Peter",Pathologe,,264

503394,Convalescent Plasma Transfusion for the Treatment of COVID-19-Experience from Poland: A Multicenter Study,2020,"Diagnostic tests have been considered as the main alternative for the control of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as a correct diagnosis allows for decision making when facing the disease, particularly as there is a lack of effective therapeutic protocols and vaccines. Thus, in this review, we summarized the main diagnostic approaches currently available for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans based on studies available in article databases. The tests can be organized into two main categories: nucleic acid-based tests, recommended for the initial detection of the virus, and serological tests, recommended for assessing the disease progression. The studies have shown that the performance of diagnostic methods depends on different factors, such as the type of samples and the characteristics of each assay. It was identified that the positivity of the tests is mainly related to the onset of symptoms. We also observed that point-of-care diagnoses are considered as one of the main trends in this area, due to the low-cost and simplicity of the assay; however, the analytical performance must be critically analyzed. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the critical role of diagnostic technologies in the control of infectious diseases.","Machado, Bruna Aparecida Souza; Hodel, Katharine Valéria Saraiva; Barbosa-Júnior, Valdir Gomes; Soares, Milena Botelho Pereira; Badaró, Roberto",Viruses,,264

We describe the strategies adopted to cope with the limitations imposed by the pandemic to the access to health care by patients diagnosed with idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational analysis including IPF patients under antifibrotic drugs (nintedanib and pirfenidone) that accessed to the Outpatient clinic of the University of Palermo, Italy. Patients received a phone number and an email address in case of any urgency and a virtual meeting was settled up monthly. RESULTS: 40 patients (M/F: 30/10) were followed up, 33 under nintedanib treatment, 7 under pirfenidone. Among patients under nintedanib, 1 patient reported high fever (T max 39 °C) and purulent sputum with no sign of infections, 1 had hemoptysis that was spontaneously resolved. 2 patients accessed to the emergency department for the worsening of dyspnea; 5 patients had diarrhea that resolved with symptomatic drugs in few days. 3 patients had an increase of alkaline phosphatase levels, leading to the withdrawal of the antifibrotic drug for 15 days, and subsequent normalization of the plasmatic levels. Among patients under pirfenidone, one subject had an increase of ferritin serum levels with no symptoms. The remaining subjects were in stable clinical conditions. None of the patients reported hospitalization or exacerbations, and did not experience antifibrotic withdrawal. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to demonstrate that by implementing alternative ways to monitor the disease, patients did not incur in increased rates of acute exacerbations or higher frequency of side effects and antifibrotic treatment withdrawal.","Benfante, Alida; Messina, Riccardo; Piccionello, Ilaria; Di Liberti, Rosangela; Principe, Stefania; Scichilone, Nicola",Pulm Pharmacol Ther,,264
503921,Potential mechanisms of hemorrhagic stroke in elderly COVID-19 patients,2020,"The systemic processes involved in the manifestation of life-threatening COVID-19 and in disease recovery are still incompletely understood, despite investigations focusing on the dysregulation of immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection. To define hallmarks of severe COVID-19 and disease recovery in convalescent patients, we combined analyses of immune cells and cytokine/chemokine networks with endothelial activation and injury. ICU patients displayed an altered immune signature with prolonged lymphopenia but expansion of granulocytes and plasmablasts along with activated and terminally differentiated T and NK cells and high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Core signature of seven plasma proteins revealed a highly inflammatory microenvironment in addition to endothelial injury in severe COVID-19. Changes within this signature were associated with either disease progression or recovery. In summary, our data suggest that besides a strong inflammatory response, severe COVID-19 is driven by endothelial activation and barrier disruption, whereby recovery depends on the regeneration of the endothelial integrity.","Ruhl, Louisa; Pink, Isabell; Kuehne, Jenny F; Beushausen, Kerstin; Keil, Jana; Christoph, Stella; Sauer, Andrea; Boblitz, Lennart; Schmidt, Julius; David, Sascha; Jaeck, Hans-Martin; Roth, Edith; Cornberg, Markus; Schulz, Thomas F.; Welte, Tobias; Hoeper, Marius; Falk, Christine S.",,,264

Surgical volume and clinic visits are curtailed, personal protective equipment for operating room participation is restricted, and the risk of COVID-19 disease transmission during heretofore routine patient care is the new norm. METHODS: We describe a small-team ""cohorting"" protocol including guidelines for faculty and resident in common clinical scenarios with attention paid to the risk of common otolaryngologic procedures. RESULTS: A rotating small-team approach was implemented at each clinical site, limiting interaction between department members but providing comprehensive coverage. Faculty were involved at the earliest phase of clinical interactions. Guidelines delineated faculty and resident roles based on risk stratification by patient COVID status and anticipated procedures. Special consideration was given to high-risk procedures such as endoscopy and tracheotomy. CONCLUSIONS: A small-team-based approach with guidelines for faculty/resident roles may mitigate risk while optimizing patient care and maximizing education.","Park, Jason S; El-Sayed, Ivan H; Young, VyVy N; Pletcher, Steven D",Head Neck,,264

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is rapidly spreading worldwide, and WHO declared the outbreak of this disease a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Though some of the countries have succeeded in slowing down the rate of the spread of this pandemic, most the countries across the globe are still continuing to experience an increasing trend in the growth and spread of this deadly disease. Hence, in the current scenario, is has now become essential to control and finally irradicate this deadly disease using an effective vaccine. One can expect the prominent role of already available antivirals, antibodies and anti-inflammatory drugs in the market, in this pandemic. Immunomodulatory and biological therapeutics are also in the high expectations to combat COVID-19. RNA based vaccines might be more advantageous over traditional vaccines, to deal with the pandemic threat. Aiming towards this direction, clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine are currently underway all across the globe. Currently, about 150 health related organizations and research labs are in the progress for the evolution of COVID-19 vaccines, globally. The initial aim of these clinical trials is to assess vaccine's safety, which is tested in Phase I/II/III studies where the primary outcomes typically examine the frequency of adverse effects. The vaccine is about to undergo phase III testing in several countries such as India, USA, South Africa, Brazil and England. US Government, under Operation Wrap Speed is even ready to sponsor three candidates, namely-The University of Oxford and AstraZeneca's AZD1222; Moderna's mRNA-1273; and Pfizer and BioNTech's BNT162 for Phase III trials.","Goyal, Madhusudan; Tewatia, Nisha; Vashisht, Hemlata; Jain, Reena; Kumar, Sudershan",J Infect Public Health,,264

The strategy during the second wave was to minimize the restrictions set for children. Children spread influenza and therefore simultaneous influenza and COVID-19 surges were feared. The aim of this report is to analyze the epidemiology of influenza season 2020-2021 in Finland. Data for this retrospective register-based study were gathered from the National Infectious Disease Register, all laboratory-confirmed influenza cases from August 2017 to March 2021 were included. The positive influenza findings were stratified by age, and incidences per 100 000 persons were calculated. Only 41 influenza A and B cases have been reported in this season from August 2020 to March 2021, which adds up to an incidence of 0.9 per 100 000 person-years. In the three preceding years, the numbers and corresponding incidences from August to March were 12 461 (282 per 100 000 person-years) in 2019-2020, 15 276 (346 per 100 000 person-years) in 2018-2019, and 33 659 (761 per 100 000 person-years) in 2017-2018.

This study was designed to analyze the recurrent positive rate of NA results after consecutively negative results, and the relationship between the specific antibody production and positive NA rate. According to Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines, data of inpatients in Sino-French New City Branch of Tongji Hospital between Jan. 28 and Mar. 6, 2020 were collected. A total of 564 COVID-19 patients over 14 years old who received the examinations of NA and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were included. Days of viral shedding and specific antibodies were recorded and assessed. Among NA tests in respiratory samples (throat swabs, nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum and flushing fluid in alveoli), the patients with all-negative NA results accounted for 17.20%, those with single-positive results for 46.63%, and those with multiple-positive results for 36.17% respectively. Besides, the recurrent positive NA results after consecutively negative results appeared in 66 patients (11.70%). For multiple-positive patients, median viral shedding duration was 20 days (range: 1 to 57 days). Of the 205 patients who received 2 or more antibody tests, 141 (68.78%) had decreased IgG and IgM concentrations. IgM decreased to normal range in 24 patients, with a median of 44 days from symptom onset. Viral shedding duration was not significantly correlated with gender, age, disease severity, changes in pulmonary imaging, and antibody concentration. It is concluded that antibody level and antibody change had no significant correlation with the positive rate of NA tests and the conversion rate after continuous negative NA tests. In order to reduce the recurrent positive proportion after discharge, 3 or more consecutive negative NA test results with test interval more than 24 h every time are suggested for the discharge or release from quarantine.","Gong, Jing; Dong, Hui; Wang, Ding-Kun; Lu, Fu-Er; Huang, Zhao-Yi; Fang, Ke; Huang, Wen-Ya; Yuan, Fen; Chen, Xing; Xia, Qing-Song; Ma, Le-Yi; Wu, Fan; Su, Hao; Gong, Min-Min; Tang, Yue-Heng; Nie, Ke-Xin; Wang, Zhi; Tu, Sheng-Hao; Zhang, Ming-Min; Li, Jing-Bin",Curr Med Sci,,264

Purpose To assess the incidence, patterns, and severity of injuries in victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, compared with the prior three years. Materials and Methods The demographics, clinical presentation, injuries, and radiological findings of patients reporting physical abuse arising from IPV during the statewide COVID-19 pandemic between March 11th and May 3rd, 2020 were compared with the same period over the past three years. Pearson's chi-squared and Fischer's exact have been used for analysis. Results 26 physical IPV victims from 2020 (37+/-13 years, 25 women) were evaluated and compared with 42 physical IPV victims (41+/-15 years, 40 women) from 2017-2019. While the overall number of patients reporting IPV decreased during the pandemic, the incidence of physical IPV was 1.8 times greater (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 3.0, p = 0.01). The total number of deep injuries was 28 during 2020 versus 16 from 2017-2019; the number of deep injuries per victim was 1.1 during 2020 compared with 0.4 from 2017-2019 (p<0.001). The incidence of high-risk abuse defined by mechanism was greater by 2 times (95% CI 1.2 to 4.7, p = 0.01). Patients with IPV in during the COVID-19 pandemic were more likely to be ethnically white, 17 (65%) victims in 2020 were ethnically white compared to 11 (26%) in the prior years (p=0.007). Conclusion There was a higher incidence and severity of physical intimate partner violence (IPV) during the COVID 19 pandemic compared with the prior three years. These results suggest that IPV victims delayed reaching out to health care services until the late stages of the abuse cycle during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Gosangi, Babina; Park, Hyesun; Thomas, Richard; Gujrathi, Rahul; Bay, Camden P; Raja, Ali S; Seltzer, Steven E; Balcom, Marta Chadwick; McDonald, Meghan L; Orgill, Dennis P; Harris, Mitchel B; Boland, Giles W; Rexrode, Kathryn; Khurana, Bharti",Radiology,,264

The causative agent was identified as a novel b-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the disease was named COVID-19. Since the beginning of 2020, the infection has spread worldwide, which led the WHO to declare COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern and to characterize the current situation as a pandemic. The transmission occurs mainly via respiratory droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 days. Most cases are mild, but some patients develop severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress, septic shock and multi-organ failure. The most common symptoms include fever, dry cough, myalgia and shortness of breath. Characteristic laboratory findings are normal white blood cell count or mild leukopenia, marked lymphopenia, in severe cases elevated CRP, procalcitonin, LDH, and D-dimer are commonly found. Typical imaging findings include multifocal peripherally distributed ground-glass opacities or consolidations, interlobular septal thickening, crazy paving appearance and cystic changes. The overall case fatality rate is estimated to range from 1 to 3 %, however, it is dependent on age and underlying medical comorbidities.

Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) are at highest risk. There are not many studies reporting its incidence in non-ICU patients. A large number of COVID-19 patients in Singapore, with symptoms ranging from mild to moderate, have been admitted to either Community Care Facilities (CCF) or in general wards of Public Healthcare Institutions (PHI). In case there is a surge of COVID-19 patients, there is a possibility that general wards in PHIs may need to admit an increasing numbers of acutely ill patients, with only the critical ones being admitted to ICU. The incidence of VTE in non-ICU patients is not exactly known and its detection in these patients is challenging. Thus, the healthcare staff managing these patients at the CCFs and general wards at the PHIs should be vigilant and monitor these patients for development of signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis, as well as trend D-dimer level. An algorithm for a potential approach to manage VTE in non-ICU COVID-19 patients is described. A prospective study is needed to establish the incidence of VTE in non-ICU patients in Singapore and the predictive value of D-dimer levels to detect this risk, as well as a therapeutic protocol to initiate appropriate pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in these patients.","Pothiawala, Sohil",Proc.

From such a wide global data analysis, our results demonstrated that different US states and countries showed dramatically different patterns of pandemic trend. The values and limitations of our modelling are discussed.","Tang, Yuanji; Tang, Sherry; Wang, Shixia",Emerg Microbes Infect,,264
512738,Patient-Friendly Summary of the ACR Appropriateness Criteria: Radiologic Management of Venous Thromboembolism-Inferior Vena Cava Filters,2020,"Importance: In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, 2 mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) received emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration in December 2020. Some patients in the US have developed delayed localized cutaneous vaccine reactions that have been dubbed ""COVID arm."" Objective: To describe the course of localized cutaneous injection-site reactions to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, subsequent reactions to the second vaccine dose, and to characterize the findings of histopathologic examination of the reaction. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective case series study was performed at Yale New Haven Hospital, a tertiary medical center in New Haven, Connecticut, with 16 patients referred with localized cutaneous injection-site reactions from January 20 through February 12, 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: We collected each patient's demographic information, a brief relevant medical history, clinical course, and treatment (if any); and considered the findings of a histopathologic examination of 1 skin biopsy specimen. Results: Of 16 patients (median [range] age, 38 [25-89] years; 13 [81%] women), 14 patients self-identified as White and 2 as Asian. The delayed localized cutaneous reactions developed in a median (range) of 7 (2-12) days after receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. These reactions occurred at or near the injection site and were described as pruritic, painful, and edematous pink plaques. None of the participants had received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Results of a skin biopsy specimen demonstrated a mild predominantly perivascular mixed infiltrate with lymphocytes and eosinophils, consistent with a dermal hypersensitivity reaction. Of participants who had a reaction to first vaccine dose (15 of 16 patients), most (11 patients) developed a similar localized injection-site reaction to the second vaccine dose; most (10 patients) also developed the second reaction sooner as compared with the first-dose reaction. Conclusions and Relevance: Clinical and histopathologic findings of this case series study indicate that the localized injection-site reactions to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine are a delayed hypersensitivity reaction. These reactions may occur sooner after the second dose, but they are self-limited and not associated with serious vaccine adverse effects. In contrast to immediate hypersensitivity reactions (eg, anaphylaxis, urticaria), these delayed reactions (dubbed ""COVID arm"") are not a contraindication to subsequent vaccination.","Johnston, Margaret S; Galan, Anjela; Watsky, Kalman L; Little, Alicia J","JAMA dermatol.

516785,Interrelations between COVID-19 and other disorders,2020,"Background and Objectives: Nearly three months after its first recorded case, the progression of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has been slow in India so far, with relatively low number of cases and deaths. The behavior of the general public will probably have the most important bearing on the course of the disease over the next few months in India. We aim to study the awareness, attitudes and perceptions of COVID-19 among the adult Indian population. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted using the 'Google Survey Forms' between 29th March and 14th April 2020 and distributed through email and various social media groups. Results: There were 1502 respondents, majority were male (56.7%), between 30-49 years (47.7%). 90% of the respondents had either an undergraduate or postgraduate degree, with a third of them being in the healthcare sector (34.6%). Most of the respondents were aware of the common symptoms of COVID-19, but worryingly only a third (31%) were aware of the risk of spread from infected asymptomatic individuals, which is a major concern in India. Majority were aware of the modes of virus transmission, but only two-thirds (68.6%) were aware of the safe physical distance (6 feet) for maintain social distancing. A majority of respondents were appreciative of the government interventions in containing the virus spread and would support further extension of lockdown if necessary. Conclusion: Despite limitations of generalizability, this survey has identified areas which the public health authorities need to target in future information campaigns.","Hakeem, Abdul Rahman; Baskaran, Kavin; Chandrasekaran, Sruti; Menon, Jagadeesh; Reddy, Mettu Srinivas; Rela, Mohamed",J Assoc Physicians India,,264
516827,"Management of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke During the COVID-19 Pandemic at a Single Institution in Beijing, China: A Brief Report",2020,"A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic that has killed millions of people, worldwide vaccination and herd immunity are still far away, and few therapeutics are approved by regulatory agencies for widespread use. The coronavirus 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) is a commonly investigated target in COVID-19, however less work has been directed toward the equally important papain-like protease (PLpro). PLpro is less characterized due to its fewer and more diverse cleavages in coronavirus proteomes and the assumption that it mainly modulates host pathways with its deubiquitinating activity. Here, I extend my previous work on 3CLpro human cleavage prediction and enrichment/depletion analysis to PLpro.[1] Using three sets of neural networks trained on different taxonomic ranks of dataset with a maximum of 463 different putative PLpro cleavages, Matthews correlation coefficients of 0.900, 0.948, and 0.966 were achieved for Coronaviridae, Betacoronavirus, and Sarbecovirus, respectively. I predict that more than 1,000 human proteins may be cleaved by PLpro depending on diversity of the training dataset and that many of these proteins are distinct from those previously predicted to be cleaved by 3CLpro. PLpro cleavages are similarly nonrandomly distributed and result in many annotations shared with 3CLpro cleavages including ubiquitination, poly(A) tail and 5 cap RNA binding proteins, helicases, and endogenous viral proteins. Combining PLpro with 3CLpro cleavage predictions, additional novel enrichment analysis was performed on known substrates of cleaved E3 ubiquitin ligases with results indicating that many pathways including viral RNA sensing are affected indirectly by E3 ligase cleavage independent of traditional PLpro deubiquitinating activity. As with 3CLpro, PLpro whole proteome cleavage prediction revealed many novel potential therapeutic targets against coronaviruses, although experimental verification is similarly required.","Prescott, Lucas",,,264
517021,"How to perform a cardio-thoracic magnetic resonance imaging in COVID-19: comprehensive assessment of heart, pulmonary arteries, and lung parenchyma",2020,"INTRODUCTION: From the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, public health officials have sought to develop evidence-based messages to reduce COVID-19 transmission by communicating key information to media outlets and the public. We describe the development of an interdisciplinary rapid message testing model to quickly create, test, and share messages with public health officials for use in health campaigns and policy briefings. METHODS: An interdisciplinary research team from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill assembled in March 2020 to assist the state health department in developing evidence-based messages to influence social distancing behaviors in the state. We developed and iteratively executed a rapid message testing model; the components of the 4-step model were message creation, survey development, survey administration, and analysis and presentation to health department officials. The model was executed 4 times, each during a 7-day period in April and May, and each subsequent survey included new phrasing and/or messaging informed by the previous week's survey. A total of 917 adults from North Carolina participated in the 4 surveys. RESULTS: Survey participants rated messages focused on protecting oneself and others higher than messages focused on norms and fear-based approaches. Pairing behaviors with motivations increased participants' desire to social distance across all themes and subgroups. For example, adding ""Protect your grandmother, your neighbor with cancer, and your best friend with asthma,"" to messaging received a 0.9-point higher score than the base message, ""Stay 6 feet apart from others when out in public."" PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Our model to promote social distancing in North Carolina during the COVID-19 pandemic can be used for rapid, iterative message testing during public health emergencies.","Bartels, Sophia M; Gora Combs, Katherine; Lazard, Allison J; Shelus, Victoria; Davis, C Hunter; Rothschild, Allison; Drewry, Maura; Carpenter, Kathryn; Newman, Emily; Goldblatt, Allison; Dasgupta, Nabarun; Hill, Lauren M; Ribisl, Kurt M",Public Health Rep,,264
517616,Convalescent plasma therapy - a silver lining for COVID-19 management?,2021,"Background: COVID-19, a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, has now spread to most countries and regions of the world. As patients potentially infected by SARS-CoV-2 need to visit hospitals, the incidence of nosocomial infection can be expected to be high. Therefore, a comprehensive and objective understanding of nosocomial infection is needed to guide the prevention and control of the epidemic. Methods: We searched major international and Chinese databases: Medicine, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane, CBM (China Biology Medicine disc), CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) and Wanfang database for case series or case reports on nosocomial infections of COVID-19, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndromes) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) from their inception to March 31st, 2020. We conducted a meta-analysis of the proportion of nosocomial infection patients in the diagnosed patients, occupational distribution of nosocomial infection medical staff. Results: We included 40 studies. Among the confirmed patients, the proportions of nosocomial infections with early outbreaks of COVID-19, SARS, and MERS were 44.0%, 36.0%, and 56.0%, respectively. Of the confirmed patients, the medical staff and other hospital-acquired infections accounted for 33.0% and 2.0% of COVID-19 cases, 37.0% and 24.0% of SARS cases, and 19.0% and 36.0% of MERS cases, respectively. Nurses and doctors were the most affected among the infected medical staff. The mean numbers of secondary cases caused by one index patient were 29.3 and 6.3 for SARS and MERS, respectively. Conclusions: The proportion of nosocomial infection in patients with COVID-19 was 44% in the early outbreak. Patients attending hospitals should take personal protection. Medical staff should be awareness of the disease to protect themselves and the patients.","Zhou, Qi; Gao, Yelei; Wang, Xingmei; Liu, Rui; Du, Peipei; Wang, Xiaoqing; Zhang, Xianzhuo; Lu, Shuya; Wang, Zijun; Shi, Qianling; Li, Weiguo; Ma, Yanfang; Luo, Xufei; Fukuoka, Toshio; Ahn, Hyeong Sik; Lee, Myeong Soo; Liu, Enmei; Chen, Yaolong; Luo, Zhengxiu; Yang, Kehu",Ann.

518290,Impact of COVID-19 on Patient Behavior to Stroke Symptoms in China,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To assess feasibility, patient satisfaction, and financial advantages of telemedicine for epilepsy ambulatory care during the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The demographic and clinical characteristics of all consecutive patients evaluated via telemedicine at a level 4 epilepsy center between March 20 and April 20, 2020 were obtained retrospectively from electronic medical records. A telephone survey to assess patient satisfaction and preferences was conducted within one month following the initial visit. RESULTS: Among 223 telehealth patients, 85.7% used both synchronous audio and video technology. During the visits, 39% of patients had their anticonvulsants adjusted while 18.8% and 11.2% were referred to laboratory/diagnostic testing and specialty consults, respectively. In a post-visit survey, the highest degree of satisfaction with care was expressed by 76.9% of patients. The degree of satisfaction tended to increase the further a patient lived from the clinic (pâ¯=â¯0.05). Beyond the pandemic, 89% of patients reported a preference for continuing telemedicine if their epilepsy symptoms remained stable, while only 44.4% chose telemedicine should their symptoms worsen. Inclement weather and lack of transportation were factors favoring continued use of telemedicine. An estimated cost saving to patient attributed to telemedicine was $30.20â¯±â¯3.8 per visit. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest that epilepsy care via telemedicine provided high satisfaction and economic benefit, without compromising patients' quality of care, thereby supporting the use of virtual care during current and future epidemiological fallouts. Beyond the current pandemic, patients with stable seizure symptoms may prefer to use telemedicine for their epilepsy care.","Datta, Proleta; Barrett, Wattana; Bentzinger, Monica; Jasinski, Tracy; Jayagopal, Lakshman Arcot; Mahoney, Alexa; Pearon, Crystal; Swaminathan, Arun; Vuppala, Aditya; Samson, Kaeli K; Wang, Hongmei; Taraschenko, Olga",Epilepsy Behav,,264

While selflessly rescuing patients from death, many doctors were exposed to unacceptable risk, with little protection for themselves, and, by extension, for their families and patients. This essay examines the basis and limits of duty to treat in a time of crisis and explores how these experiences could leave doctors morally stressed and even compromised. We question whether a physician-patient relationship that treats patients' safety and well-being as separate from their doctors' personal and professional values, needs, and dignity is the best way to deliver care. Such questions predated coronavirus but were brought to the forefront because of the epidemic. As physicians process their experiences, we hope to begin a deeper moral and social conversation that might help us be better prepared for future crises.","Mangione, Salvatore; Post, Stephen G",Am J Med Sci,,264

Objective Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the physical activity, sleep and eating habits of adults and the elderly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method A cross-sectional study with a sample comprising 135 participants, divided by age group. First, the whole group was divided into age groups with a 10-year cut-off. They were then characterized by sex, type of home, eating habits, sleep, and physical activity. For the second analysis, the participants were organized into three groups: young adults (18-40 years), middle-aged adults (41-60 years) and elderly (&gt;60 years). An online questionnaire was sent to all the participants, with 26 questions focusing on eating habits, sleep, protective behaviors against COVID-19, and physical activity. Results The participants were mainly women (85.9%), external community (71.1%), students' families (17.1%), teachers and staff (11.8%). Of the total participants, 40% were dedicated to home care activities and 21.1% had started working from home. The remainder (38.9%) were engaged in activities such as studying or caring for dependents. The younger age group (18-40 years old) reported spending more time in sedentary activities during the day, and 34.2% did not perform physical activity and ate lower quality food during social isolation (p&lt;0.01). All groups, with the exception of the 30-40 age group (p &lt;0.01) highlighted the importance of having the presence of a teacher responsible for guiding physical activities during isolation.

520801,Persistent Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging Features of Myocarditis Detected Months After COVID-19 Infection,2021,"Conducting numerous, rapid, and reliable PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 is essential for our ability to monitor and control the current COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we tested the sensitivity and efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 detection in clinical samples collected directly into a mix of lysis buffer and RNA preservative, thus inactivating the virus immediately after sampling. We tested 79 COVID-19 patients and 20 healthy controls. We collected two samples (nasopharyngeal swabs) from each participant: one swab was inserted into a test tube with Viral Transport Medium (VTM), following the standard guideline used as the recommended method for sample collection; the other swab was inserted into a lysis buffer supplemented with nucleic acid stabilization mix (coined NSLB). We found that RT-qPCR tests of patients were significantly more sensitive with NSLB sampling, reaching detection threshold 2.1±0.6 (Mean±SE) PCR cycles earlier then VTM samples from the same patient. We show that this improvement is most likely since NSLB samples are not diluted in lysis buffer before RNA extraction. Re-extracting RNA from NSLB samples after 72 hours at room temperature did not affect the sensitivity of detection, demonstrating that NSLB allows for long periods of sample preservation without special cooling equipment. We also show that swirling the swab in NSLB and discarding it did not reduce sensitivity compared to retaining the swab in the tube, thus allowing improved automation of COVID-19 tests. Overall, we show that using NSLB instead of VTM can improve the sensitivity, safety, and rapidity of COVID-19 tests at a time most needed.","Erster, Oran; Shkedi, Omer; Benedek, Gil; Zilber, Eyal; Varkovitzky, Itay; Shirazi, Rachel; Oriya Shorka, Dorit; Cohen, Yuval; Bar, Tzahi; Yechieli, Rafi; Tepperberg Oikawa, Michal; Venkert, Dana; Linial, Michal; Oiknine-Djian, Esther; Mandelboim, Michal; Livneh, Zvi; Shenhav-Saltzman, Gilat; Mendelson, Ella; Wolf, Dana; Szwarcwort-Cohen, Moran; Mor, Orna; Lewis, Yair; Zeevi, Danny",PLoS One,,264

However, little data are available about medical students' distress during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide details on how medical students have been affected by the pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted. A total of 717 medical students participated in the web-based survey. The survey included questions about how the participants' mental status had changed from before to after the Japanese nationwide state of emergency (SOE). RESULTS: Out of 717 medical students, 473 (66.0%) participated in the study. In total, 29.8% (141/473) of the students reported concerns about the shift toward online education, mostly because they thought online education would be ineffective compared with in-person learning. The participants' subjective mental health status significantly worsened after the SOE was lifted (P<.001). Those who had concerns about a shift toward online education had higher odds of having generalized anxiety and being depressed (odds ratio [OR] 1.97, 95% CI 1.19-3.28) as did those who said they would request food aid (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.16-3.44) and mental health care resources (OR 3.56, 95% CI 2.07-6.15).

521877,Elevated Blood Pressure Increases Pneumonia Risk: Epidemiological Association and Mendelian Randomization in the UK Biobank,2020,"With the developing COVID-19 pandemic, patients with inherited anaemias require specific advice regarding isolation and changes to usual treatment schedules. The National Haemoglobinopathy Panel (NHP) has issued guidance on the care of patients with sickle cell disease, thalassaemia, Diamond Blackfan anaemia (DBA), congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia (CDA), sideroblastic anaemia, pyruvate kinase deficiency and other red cell enzyme and membrane disorders. Cascading of accurate information for clinicians and patients is paramount to preventing adverse outcomes, such as patients who are at increased risk of fulminant bacterial infection due to their condition or its treatment erroneously self-isolating if their fever is mistakenly attributed to a viral cause, delaying potentially life-saving antibiotic therapy. Outpatient visits should be minimised for most patients, however some, such as first transcranial dopplers for children with sickle cell anaemia should not be delayed as known risk of stroke will outweigh the unknown risk from COVID-19 infection. Blood transfusion programmes should be continued, but specific changes to usual clinical pathways can be instituted to reduce risk of patient exposure to COVID-19, as well as contingency planning for possible reductions in blood available for transfusions. Bone marrow transplants for these disorders should be postponed until further notice. With the current lack of evidence on the risk and complications of COVID-19 infection in these patients, national data collection is ongoing to record outcomes and eventually to identify predictors of disease severity, particularly important if further waves of infection travel through the population.","Roy, Noémi B A; Telfer, Paul; Eleftheriou, Perla; de la Fuente, Josu; Drasar, Emma; Shah, Farrukh; Roberts, David; Atoyebi, Wale; Trompeter, Sara; Layton, D Mark; Lugthart, Sanne; Stuart-Smith, Sara; Chakravorty, Subarna; Wright, Josh; Porter, John; Inusa, Baba; Howard, Jo",Br J Haematol,,264

We show that this size is strongly related to the regularity of $\partial \Omega$ by providing bounds on the Hausdorff dimension of $\partial E\cap \partial\Omega$. In particular we show that, if $\partial \Omega$ has $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity then $\mathcal{H}^{d-2+\alpha}(\partial E\cap \partial\Omega)>0$. This shows that a sufficient condition to ensure that $\mathcal{H}^{d-1}(\partial E\cap \partial \Omega)>0$ is that $\partial \Omega$ has $C^{1,1}$ regularity. Since the Hausdorff bounds can be inferred in dependence of the regularity of $\partial E$ as well, we obtain that $\Omega$ convex, which yields $\partial E\in C^{1,1}$, is also a sufficient condition. Finally, we construct examples showing that such bounds are optimal in dimension $d=2$.","Caroccia, Marco; Ciani, Simone",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06439v2.pdf,264
522686,Epidemiological characteristics of novel coronavirus infection in Okayama Prefecture,2021,"BACKGROUND: Associations of excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) with greater birthweight and childhood obesity may be confounded by shared familial environment or genetics. Sibling comparisons can minimize variation in these confounders because siblings grow up in similar environments and share the same genetic predisposition for weight gain. METHODS: We identified 96 289 women with live births in 2008-2014 at Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Fifteen percent of women (N = 14 417) had at least two births during the study period for sibling analyses. We assessed associations of GWG according to the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendations with birthweight and obesity at age 3 years, using conventional analyses comparing outcomes between mothers and sibling analyses comparing outcomes within mothers, which control for stable within-family unmeasured confounders such as familial environment and genetics. We used generalized estimating-equations and fixed-effects models. RESULTS: In conventional analyses, GWG above the IOM recommendations was associated with 88% greater odds of large-for-gestational age birthweight [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.80, 1.97] and 30% greater odds of obesity at 3 years old (95% CI: 1.24, 1.37) compared with GWG within the IOM recommendations. In sibling analyses, GWG above the IOM recommendations was also associated with greater odds of large-for-gestational age [odds ratio (OR): 1.36; 95% CI: 1.20, 1.54], but was not associated with obesity at 3 years old (OR = 0.98; 95% CI: 0.84, 1.15). CONCLUSIONS: GWG likely has a direct impact on birthweight; however, shared environmental and lifestyle factors within families may play a larger role in determining early-childhood weight status and obesity risk than GWG.","Badon, Sylvia E; Quesenberry, Charles P; Xu, Fei; Avalos, Lyndsay A; Hedderson, Monique M",Int. j. epidemiol,,264

The phenomenological explanation offered is a new mutation of the virus, first identified in the UK. We use publicly available data in combination with a controlled SIR model, which captures the effects of preventive measures on the active cases, to show that the current wave of infections is consistent with a single transmission rate. This suggests that the new SARS-CoV-2 variant is as transmissible as previous strains. Our findings indicate that the relaxation of preventive measures is closely related with the ongoing surge in cases. We simulate the effects of new restrictions and vaccination campaigns in 2021, demonstrating that lockdown policies are not fully effective to flatten the curve. For effective mitigation, it is critical that the public keeps on high alert until vaccination reaches a critical threshold.","Duran-Olivencia, M.

METHODS: We administered an online survey to a convenience sample of rheumatologists in the US from 4/8/20-5/4/20 via social media and group emails. Survey respondents provided demographic information such as, age, gender, state of practice, and practice type. We asked questions about COVID-19 risk in rheumatic patients, as well as their medication management during the pandemic. We conducted descriptive analysis and Multivariable regression models. RESULTS: 271 respondents completed the survey nationally. 48% of respondents either agreed or strongly agreed with the statement “Patients with rheumatic diseases are at a higher risk of COVID-19 irrespective of their immunosuppressive medications”. 50% disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement “The pandemic has led you to reduce the use/dosage/frequency of biologics”, while 56% agreed or strongly agreed with the statement “The pandemic has led you to reduce the use/dosage/frequency of steroids”. A third of respondents indicated that at least 10% of their patients had self-discontinued or reduced at least one immunosuppressive medication to mitigate their risk of COVID-19. Responses to these questions as well as to questions regarding NSAID prescription patterns were significantly different in the Northeast region of US compared to other regions. CONCLUSION: In this national sample of rheumatologists, there are variations regarding perceptions of patients’ risk of COVID-19, and how to manage medications such as NSAIDs, biologics and steroids during the pandemic. These variations are more pronounced in geographical areas where COVID-19 disease burden was high.","Mehta, Bella; Jannat-Khah, Deanna; Mancuso, Carol A.; Bass, Anne R.; Moezinia, Carine J; Gibofsky, Allan; Goodman, Susan M.; Ibrahim, Said",Semin Arthritis Rheum,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0049017220301967; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049017220301967?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semarthrit.2020.06.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32911282/,264

Covid-19 morbidity and mortality variances among countries has been suggested by previous works to be influenced BCG and previous Latent TB infection (which is reflected by TB prevalence) by possible inducing heterogeneous immunity against SARS-COV2. Aim: To examine influence of BCG status and TB prevalence on variances among countries which register new multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Methods: We choose all countries which report MIS-C till 23/6/2020, number of cases for each 10 million capita was examined among 3 categories of countries classified according to BCG program status. TB prevalence, MIS-C no. / 10 million (M) and Covid- 19 deaths/M are taken as markers. Receiver operation characteristic - (ROC) curve, as well as some relative indicators such as (sensitivity and specificity rates), estimation area of trade - off between sensitivity and specificity, and cutoff points are used for discriminating different three pairs of countries (which have different BCG practices). Discrimination of these categories done through studied markers. 95% confidence interval of all probable combinations pairs had been measured. Results: MIS-C No/10 M capita in countries never gave BCG vaccination vs countries currently give vaccine shows area under ROC- curve equal to 0.000 with a symbiotic significant of 0.034 and (95% CI interval of 0.000-0.000) also MIS-C No/10 M capita in countries not currently give BCG vaccination ( with previous mass vaccination programs) vs countries currently give mass vaccination shows area under ROC- curve equal to 0.094 with a symbiotic significant of 0.027and ( 95% CI interval of 0.000 -0.280) Important not significant finding in MIS-C No/10 M capita in countries never gave BCG vaccination vs countries not currently give vaccine shows area under ROC- curve equal to 0.583 with a symbiotic significant of 0.683 and (95% CI interval of 0.074-0.759). Countries not currently give vaccine make discrimination in other pairs COVID-19 deaths M capita in countries never gave BCG vaccination vs countries currently give vaccine shows area under ROC- curve equal to 0.083 with a symbiotic informative and reportable value of 0.077 and (95% CI interval of 0.000-0.309 also COVID-19 deaths M capita in countries not currently give BCG vaccination vs countries currently giving vaccine shows area under ROC- curve equal to 0.188 with a symbiotic informative reportable value of 0.089 and ( 95% CI interval of 0.000-0.452). Important finding is the not significant association in COVID-19 deaths /M capita in countries never gave BCG vaccination vs countries not currently giving vaccine area under ROC- curve equal to 0.417 with a symbiotic significant of 0.683 and (95% CI interval of 0.078 - 0.755). Countries not currently giving vaccine make discrimination in third pair of countries in significant association and not in 1st pair. Regarding TB prevalence marker or discriminator the areas under curve were informative and reportable and too generating with the leftover markers in all 3 pairs signifying inverse relations with covide-19 mortality and MIS-C no. curves . Conclusion: BCG vaccinations and high TB prevalence are found in this study to be related to decrease MIS-C and COVID-19 deaths this might explain variances among countries worldwide. Further studies to confirm this relations and possible relations with other epidemics is recommended. Review of TB programs in relation to treat latent asymptomatic infections and initiate and consolidate BCG programs should be considered urgently.","Raham, T.

Multiple evidence revealed the interdependence between the presence of cardiovascular comorbidities and a severe course of COVID-19, with heart failure (HF) being incriminated as an independent predictor of mortality. Suppression of tumorigenicity-2 ST2 has emerged as one of the most promising biomarkers in assessing the evolution and prognosis of patients with HF. The uniqueness of ST2 is determined by its structural particularities. Its transmembrane isoform exerts cardioprotective effects, while the soluble isoform (sST2), which is detectable in serum, is associated with myocardial fibrosis and poor outcome in patients with HF. Some recent data also suggested the potential role of sST2 as a marker of inflammation, while other studies highlighted it as a valuable prognostic factor in patients with COVID-19. In this review, we summarized the pathways by which sST2 is related to myocardial injury and its connection to the severity of inflammation in patients with COVID-19. Also, we reviewed possible perspectives of using it as a dual cardio-inflammatory biomarker, for both early diagnosis, risk stratification and prognosis assessment of patients with concomitant HF and COVID-19.","Miftode, Radu-Stefan; Petriș, Antoniu Octavian; Onofrei Aursulesei, Viviana; Cianga, Corina; Costache, Irina-Iuliana; Mitu, Ovidiu; Miftode, Ionela-Larisa; Șerban, Ionela-Lăcrămioara",Diagnostics (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics11020175; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33530550/,264

SUBJECT AND METHODS: Using a mixed-method approach, an online cross-sectional survey among 315 participants and in-depth interviews (IDI) among 20 young adults were conducted from May 1 to May 25, 2020. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were performed for quantitative data, along with the thematic analysis for qualitative data. RESULTS: The mean (± SD) age of the participants was 26.54 (± 3.05), and the majority were male (54.9%). About 81.6% of the participants reported COVID-19 as a viral disease, transmitted through droplets of sneezing and coughing, and close contact with another person (90.8%). Nearly 40% of participants reported news channels as a reliable source of information for COVID-19. Participants who were male were less likely to be aware than females in terms of mode of transmission of COVID-19 such as going outside of the home (82.7% male vs 90.8% female; p < 0.05). Male participants thought they were perfectly healthy and more reluctant to agree with maintaining social distance compared to female participants (72.8% male vs 90.1% female; p < 0.001). Participant’s satisfaction level with services provided by the government was also significantly different and higher among females than male participants (39.9% male vs 53.5% female; p < 0.05). The majority of the participants reported suffering due to financial uncertainty, psychological distress, and inadequate health facilities. Dissatisfaction was reported with the existing health services as creating several misconceptions, lacking testing facilities, and debasement by the health professionals.

Liver injury is not uncommon in patients with COVID-19, and clarifying its characteristics is needed. This study aimed to identify factors associated with liver injury and to develop a new classification of predictive severity in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Confirmed patients with COVID-19 (n = 60) were recruited retrospectively from Musashino Red Cross Hospital. The factors of liver injury especially on the elevation of liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) were analyzed. Grading was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. RESULTS: During a median hospitalization follow-up of 15 (4–41) days, 51 (85.0%) patients had COVID-19 pneumonia. In clinical courses, oxygenation was needed for 25 (41.6%) patients and intubation was needed for 9 (15.0%) patients. A total of 27 (45.0%) patients had gastrointestinal symptoms (GS), such as appetite loss, diarrhea, and nausea. A logistic regression analysis revealed that C-reactive protein (CRP) at baseline, oxygenation, intubation, and GS were significant factors of liver injury. Based on these results, patients were classified into three groups: group 1, no oxygenation pneumonia; group 2, pneumonia with oxygenation or GS; and group 3, intubation. We classified 25 (41.7%), 26 (43.3%), and 9 (15.0%) patients into mild, moderate, and severe groups, respectively. The peak of AST and ALT levels was significantly stratified with this criteria (mild [median AST, 28 IU/L; median ALT, 33 IU/L], moderate [median AST, 48 IU/L; median ALT, 47.5 IU/L], and severe [median AST, 109 IU/L; median ALT, 106 IU/L]; P<0.001 and P = 0.0114, respectively).

The study compared effects of the three models through exploring patient experience in TB diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: We selected two sites in each model of TB service in four provinces of China. In each site, 50 patients were selected from TB patient registries for a structured questionnaire survey, with a total of 293 patients recruited. All participants were newly registered uncomplicated TB cases without any major complications or resistance to first-line anti-TB drugs, and having successfully completed treatment. Diagnostic and treatment procedures were reviewed from medical charts of the surveyed patients to compare with national guidelines. RESULTS: Specialist sites had the highest patient expenditure, hospitalization rates and mostly used second-line anti-TB drugs, while the integrated model reported the opposite. The median health expenditure was USD 1,499 for the specialist sites and USD 306 for the integrated sites, with 83% and 15% patients respectively having unnecessary hospitalization. 74% of the specialist sites and 19% of the integrated sites used second-line anti-TB drugs. Mixed results were identified in the two dispensary sites. One site had median health expenditure of USD 138 with 12% of patients hospitalized, while the other had USD 912 and 65% respectively. CONCLUSION: The study observed prohibitive financial expenditure and a high level of deviation from national guidelines in all sites, which may be related to the profit-seeking behavior of public hospitals. The study supports the integrated model as the better policy option for future TB health reform in China.","Wei, Xiaolin; Zou, Guanyang; Walley, John; Yin, Jia; Lonnroth, Knut; Uplekar, Mukund; Wang, Weibing; Sun, Qiang",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090596; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621996/,264
595612,Heparin induced thrombocytopenia antibodies in COVID‐19,2020-07-13,"Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) are composed of a mono-, di-, or oligosaccharide and a ceramide and function as constituents of cell membranes. Various molecular species of GSLs have been identified in mammalian cells due to differences in the structures of oligosaccharides. The oligosaccharide structure can vary depending on cell lineage, differentiation stage, and pathology; this property can be used as a cell identification marker. Furthermore, GSLs are involved in various aspects of the immune response, such as cytokine production, immune signaling, migration of immune cells, and antibody production. GSLs containing certain structures exhibit strong immunogenicity in immunized animals and promote the production of anti-GSL antibodies. By exploiting this property, it is possible to generate antibodies that recognize the fine oligosaccharide structure of specific GSLs or glycoproteins. In our study using artificially synthesized GSLs (artGSLs), we found that several structural features are correlated with the antibody-inducing activity of GSLs. Based on these findings, we designed artGSLs that efficiently induce the production of antibodies accompanied by class switching and developed several antibodies that recognize not only certain glycan structures of GSLs but also those of glycoproteins. This review comprehensively introduces the immune activities of GSLs and their application as pharmaceuticals.","Okuda, Tetsuya",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22073776; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33917390/,264
596650,COVID-19 and ESRD: Entering a New Era of Uncertainty,2020-07-25,"African swine fever, caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV), is a highly contagious hemorrhagic disease of domestic pigs. The current continent-wide pandemic has persisted for over 10 years, and its economy-devastating effect was highlighted after spreading to China, which possesses half of the world pig industry. So far, development of an effective and safe vaccine has not been finished largely due to the knowledge gaps in pathogenesis and immunology, particularly the role of cytokines in the host's immune response. Therefore, we performed experiments in domestic pigs to analyze the kinetics of representative circulating interferons (IFNs), interleukins (ILs), growth factors, tumor necrosis factors (TNFs), and chemokines induced by infection of type II virulent ASFV SY18. Pigs infected with this Chinese prototypical isolate developed severe clinical manifestations mostly from 3 days post inoculation (dpi) and died from 7 to 8 dpi. Serum analysis revealed a trend of robust and sustained elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IFN-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-18, RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), and IFN-γ-induced protein 10 (IP-10) from 3 dpi, but not the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Moreover, secondary drastic increase of the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8, as well as elevated IL-10, was observed at the terminal phase of infection. This pattern of cytokine secretion clearly drew an image of a typical cytokine storm characterized by delayed and dysregulated initiation of the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine and imbalanced pro- and anti-inflammatory response, which paved a way for further understanding of the molecular basis of ASFV pathogenesis.","Wang, Shuchao; Zhang, Jingyuan; Zhang, Yanyan; Yang, Jinjin; Wang, Lidong; Qi, Yu; Han, Xun; Zhou, Xintao; Miao, Faming; Chen, Teng; Wang, Ying; Zhang, Fei; Zhang, Shoufeng; Hu, Rongliang",Front Vet Sci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2020.601641; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33553280/,264

The syndrome is rare, and evidence-based guidelines are lacking. This report reviews a patient who presented for medical care multiple times early in the course of his illness, thus offering near-daily documentation of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. The patient did not have thrombocytopenia, anemia, or myocardial inflammation until the fifth day of fever. These laboratory abnormalities coincided with the onset of rash, conjunctival injection, vomiting, and diarrhea: clinical signs that could serve as indicators for when to obtain blood tests. The timing of this patient’s onset of multisystem involvement suggests that testing for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children after only 24 h of fever, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends, may yield false-negative results. Testing for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children after 4 days of fever may be more reliable.","Coleman, Keli D; Benz, Paul; Parikh, Nirzar S; Thomas, Danny G; Segar, David; Block, Joseph; Schultz, Megan L",SAGE Open Med Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34646566/; https://doi.org/10.1177/2050313x211050891,264
597048,Can Hypericum perforatum (SJW) prevent cytokine storm in COVID‐19 patients?,2020-06-05,"[Image: see text] Constant or intense light degenerates the retina and retinal pigment epithelial cells. Light generates reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide leading to initial reactions of retinal degeneration. Apoptosis is the primary mechanism of abnormal death of photoreceptors, retinal ganglion cells, or retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in degenerative retinal diseases, including diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. The current study evaluated the function of erythropoietin (EPO) on angiogenesis and apoptosis in the retina and RPE under oxidative stress. We determined the pro-angiogenic and antiapoptotic mechanism of EPO under stress conditions using a conditional EPO knockdown model using siRNA, EPO addition, proteomics, immunocytochemistry, and bioinformatic analysis. Our studies verified that EPO protected retinal cells from light-, hypoxia-, hyperoxia-, and hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis through caspase inhibition, whereas up-regulated angiogenic reactions through vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiotensin pathway. We demonstrated that the EPO expression in the retina and subsequent serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase phosphorylations might be linked to oxidative stress response tightly to determining angiogenesis and apoptosis. Neuroprotective roles of EPO may involve the balance between antiapoptotic and pro-angiogenic signaling molecules, including BCL-xL, c-FOS, caspase-3, nitric oxide, angiotensin, and VEGF receptor. Our data indicate a new therapeutic application of EPO toward retinal degeneration based on the dual roles in apoptosis and angiogenesis at the molecular level under oxidative stress.","Samson, Faith Pwaniyibo; He, Weilue; Sripathi, Srinivas R.; Patrick, Ambrose Teru; Madu, Joshua; Chung, Hyewon; Frost, Megan C.; Jee, Donghyun; Gutsaeva, Diana R.; Jahng, Wan Jin",ACS Omega,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.0c02763; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32875248/,264

After nearly two months, the curve was successfully flattened and social restrictions were gradually relaxed. Unfortunately, pharmaceutical interventions are not yet available so it is expected that preventing COVID-19 outbreaks will depend mostly on the successful implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions, hence the need for well-informed models. In this study, we built a deterministic, continuous-time, age-stratified-SEIRD model with detailed hospital dynamics. Because the hospitalization data for Belgium are not made publically available by the Belgian Scientific Institute of Public Health (Sciensano), we computed the hospitalization parameters based on data from 370 patients treated in two Ghent (Belgium) hospitals. The basic reproduction number was estimated as R0 = 2.83 in March 2020 and the model fits the hospitalization and ICU admission incidence under lockdown measures well. Despite the relaxation of social restrictions, hospitalizations have been steadily declining. We recomputed the basic reproduction number under lockdown release and found that it had to be as low as R0 = 0.73 to explain the endemic trend. We further found that although the basic reproduction number in the population older than 70 years was smaller than one, this group compromises nearly half of the expected hospitalizations. This indicates that the protection of the elderly may be the most efficient way to reduce strain on the public health care system in case of another SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.","Alleman, Tijs W.; Vergeynst, Jenna; Torfs, Elena; Gonzalez, Daniel Illana; Nopens, Ingmar; Baetens, Jan M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.17.20156034v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.17.20156034,264

From that perspective, Belarus is one of a few countries with a relatively modern healthcare system, where much narrower NPIs have been put in place. Given the uniqueness of this Belarusian experience, the understanding its COVID-19 epidemiological dynamics is essential not only for the local assessment, but also for a better insight into the impact of different NPI strategies globally. In this work, we integrate genomic epidemiology and surveillance methods to investigate the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the country. The observed Belarusian SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity originated from at least eighteen separate introductions, at least five of which resulted in ongoing domestic transmissions. The introduction sources represent a wide variety of regions, although the proportion of regional virus introductions and exports from/to geographical neighbors appears to be higher than for other European countries. Phylodynamic analysis indicates a moderate reduction in the effective reproductive number [Formula: see text] after the introduction of limited NPIs, with the reduction magnitude generally being lower than for countries with large-scale NPIs. On the other hand, the estimate of the Belarusian [Formula: see text] at the early epidemic stage is comparable with this number for the neighboring ex-USSR country of Ukraine, where much broader NPIs have been implemented. The actual number of cases by the end of May, 2020 was predicted to be 2–9 times higher than the detected number of cases.","Nemira, Alina; Adeniyi, Ayotomiwa Ezekiel; Gasich, Elena L.; Bulda, Kirill Y.; Valentovich, Leonid N.; Krasko, Anatoly G.; Glebova, Olga; Kirpich, Alexander; Skums, Pavel",medRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33907756/; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.13.21255404v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.13.21255404,264

PI is a rare condition, defined as the presence of gas in the intestinal wall, and although its pathogenesis is poorly understood, intestinal ischemia is one of its causative agents. Based on COVID-19's association with vasculopathic and ischemic insults, and IL-6's protective role in intestinal epithelial ischemia–reperfusion injury, an adverse synergistic association of COVID-19 and TCZ can be proposed in the setting of PI.

By locating nationalism as a factor which facilitates or impedes global governance and international collaboration, this paper explores how nationalism influences China's political decision‐making. Given her historical experience, China has in its national psyche an impulse never to become ‘the sick man of the East’ again. Today, China's willingness to co‐operate with international bodies emanates out of reputational concerns rather than technical‐medical considerations. This was clearly manifested in her handling of two epidemics in recent years: the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and HIV/AIDS episodes.

One of the two HCWs was asymptomatic during quarantine, but the other had mild upper respiratory infection symptoms 1 day before admission, and the symptoms continued for 9 days. There was no pneumonic infiltration in chest X-ray in both patients, and no COVID-19 specific treatment was administered. Total immunoglobulin antibody and neutralizing antibody to anti-spike protein receptor-binding domain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were confirmed to be present in both HCWs in blood tests performed at 2 weeks and 4 weeks after discharge.

603275,Should global financing be the main priority for pandemic preparedness? - Authors' reply.,2021-07-31,"Background. A crucial role in epidemics is played by the number of undetected infective individuals who continue to circulate and spread the disease. Epidemiological investigations and mathematical models have revealed that the rapid diffusion of Covid-19 can mostly be attributed to the large percentage of undocumented infective individuals who escape testing. Methods. The dynamics of an infection can be described by the SIR model, which divides the population into susceptible (S), infective (I) and removed (R) subjects. In particular, we exploited the Kermack and McKendrick epidemic model which can be applied when the population is much larger than the fraction of infected subjects. Results. We proved that the fraction of undocumented infectives, in comparison to the total number of infected subjects, is given by 1-1/R0 , where R0 is the basic reproduction number. Its mean value R0=2.10 (2.09-2.11) in three Italian regions for the Covid-19 epidemic yielded a percentage of undetected infectives of 52.4% (52.2% - 52.6%) compared to the total number of infectives. Conclusions. Our results, straightforwardly obtained from the SIR model, highlight the role played by undetected carriers in the transmission and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such evidence strongly recommends careful monitoring of the infective population and ongoing adjustment of preventive measures for disease control until a vaccine becomes available.","Melis, M.; Littera, R.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.09.20149682v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.09.20149682,264

We report thromboelastography (TEG) testing on a cohort of patients with suspected COVID-19 infection at the time of admission to the intensive care unit. Methods: TEG testing was performed using the TEG 6s analyzer near or at the time of ICU admission. We also report the results of other coagulation or inflammatory related indices such as platelet count, prothrombin time, fibrinogen, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and procalcitonin. All laboratory testing was performed at the discretion of the attending physician in the course of normal patient care and retrospectively reviewed. Results: We found that maximum clot strength was consistently elevated in COVID-19 patients while normal in all patients found to be negative. We did not encounter significant prolongations of coagulation assays outside of those expectedly prolonged by heparin therapy nor was meeting the criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation encountered. Conclusions: We postulate that elevated maximum clot strength by TEG testing is predictive of COVID-19 status as within our cohort this perfectly predicted patients COVID-19 status despite a high level of suspicion in negative patients with normal TEG results. While these results require a larger cohort for confirmation, we feel that TEG testing could improve confidence in negative COVID-19 testing results in suspected patients possibly allowing for earlier de-escalation of infectious precautions and personal protective equipment utilization.","Lawicki, S.

With the explosive spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the establishment of a BSL2 adapted severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pseudovirus neutralization assay is needed to facilitate the development of countermeasures. Here, we describe an approach to generate a single-round lentiviral vector-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, which produced a signal more than 2 logs above background. Specifically, a SARS-CoV-2 spike variant with a cytoplasmic tail deletion of 13 amino acids, termed SΔCT13, conferred enhanced spike incorporation into pseudovirions and increased viral entry into cells compared to that with full-length spike (S). We further compared S and SΔCT13 in terms of their sensitivity to vaccine sera, purified convalescent-phase IgG, human ACE2 (hACE2) murine IgG (mIgG), and the virus entry inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (BafA1). We developed an SΔCT13-based pseudovirus neutralization assay and defined key assay characteristics, including linearity, limit of detection, and intra-assay and intermediate assay precision. Our data demonstrate that the SΔCT13-based pseudovirus shows enhanced infectivity in target cells, which will facilitate the assessment of humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection, antibody therapeutics, and vaccination. This pseudovirus neutralization assay can also be readily adapted to SARS-CoV-2 variants that emerge. IMPORTANCE Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. The development of a high-throughput pseudovirus neutralization assay is critical for the development of vaccines and immune-based therapeutics. In this study, we show that deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of the SARS-CoV-2 spike leads to pseudoviruses with enhanced infectivity. This SΔCT13-based pseudovirus neutralization assay should be broadly useful for the field.","Yu, Jingyou; Li, Zhenfeng; He, Xuan; Gebre, Makda S.; Bondzie, Esther A.; Wan, Huahua; Jacob-Dolan, Catherine; Martinez, David R.; Nkolola, Joseph P.; Baric, Ralph S.; Barouch, Dan H.",J Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33727331/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00044-21,264

OBJECTIVE: To study MxA protein levels in healthy state and during respiratory virus infection of young children in an observational prospective cohort. STUDY DESIGN: Blood samples and nasal swabs were collected from 153 and 77 children with and without symptoms of respiratory infections, respectively. Blood MxA protein levels were measured by an enzyme immunoassay and PCR methods were used for the detection of respiratory viruses in nasal swabs. RESULTS: Respiratory viruses were detected in 81% of symptomatic children. They had higher blood MxA protein levels (median [interquartile range]) than asymptomatic virus-negative children (695 [345–1370] μg/L vs. 110 [55–170] μg/L; p < 0.001). Within asymptomatic children, no significant difference was observed in MxA responses between virus-positive and virus-negative groups. A cut-off level of 175 μg/L had 92% sensitivity and 77% specificity for a symptomatic respiratory virus infection. Rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, coronavirus, and human metapneumovirus infections were associated with elevated MxA responses. Asymptomatic virus-negative children vaccinated with a live virus vaccine had elevated MxA protein levels (240 [120–540] μg/L), but significantly lower than children with an acute respiratory infection, who had not received vaccinations (740 [350–1425] μg/L; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Blood MxA protein levels are increased in young children with symptomatic respiratory virus infections, including rhinovirus infections.

605278,The impact of COVID‐19 lockdown on infants' coronavirus exposure and routine healthcare access in Ireland: The CORAL birth cohort study at 6 months.,2021-07-16,"[Image: see text] The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic worldwide necessitates the development of therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 is the main receptor of SARS-CoV-2 S1 and mediates viral entry into host cells. Herein, membrane nanoparticles (NPs) prepared from ACE2-rich cells were discovered to have potent capacity to block SARS-CoV-2 infection. The membranes of human embryonic kidney-239T cells highly expressing ACE2 were applied to prepare NPs using an extrusion method. The nanomaterials, termed ACE2-NPs, contained 265.1 ng mg(–1) ACE2 on the surface and acted as baits to trap S1 in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in reduced recruitment of the viral ligand to HK-2 human renal tubular epithelial cells. Aside from affecting receptor recongnition, S1 translocated to the cytoplasm and induced apoptosis by reducing optic atrophy 1 expression and increasing cytochrome c release, which was also inhibited by ACE2-NPs. Further investigations revealed that ACE2-NPs efficiently suppressed SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions entry into host cells and blocked viral infection in vitro and in vivo.

For unincentivized vaccines, the delays are even more profound, as both the supply of a vaccine from developing country manufacturers and vaccine demand from countries with the high disease burdens have to be generated in order for impact to be manifest. A number of poverty-associated infectious diseases, whose burden is greatest in low-income and middle-income countries, would benefit from appropriate levels of support for vaccine development such as Group A Streptococcus, invasive non-typhoid salmonella, schistosomiasis, shigella, to name a few. With COVID-19 vaccines we will hopefully be able to provide novel vaccine technology to all countries through a unique collaborative effort, the COVAX facility, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), Gavi, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). Whether this effort can deliver vaccine to all its participating countries remains to be seen, but this ambitious effort to develop, manufacture, distribute, and vaccinate 60–80% of the world’s population will hopefully be a lasting legacy of COVID-19.","Excler, Jean-Louis; Privor-Dumm, Lois; Kim, Jerome H",Curr Opin Immunol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0952791521000297; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952791521000297; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coi.2021.03.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33845349/,264

We used Bayesian model comparison to revisit these conclusions, allowing for heterogeneity of exposure, susceptibility and transmission. We used dynamic causal modelling to estimate the evidence for alternative models of daily cases and deaths from the USA, the UK, Brazil, Italy, France, Spain, Mexico, Belgium, Germany and Canada over the period 25 January 2020 to 15 June 2020. These data were used to estimate the proportions of people (i) not exposed to the virus, (ii) not susceptible to infection when exposed and (iii) not infectious when susceptible to infection. Bayesian model comparison furnished overwhelming evidence for heterogeneity of exposure, susceptibility and transmission. Furthermore, both lockdown and the build-up of population immunity contributed to viral transmission in all but one country. Small variations in heterogeneity were sufficient to explain large differences in mortality rates. The best model of UK data predicts a second surge of fatalities will be much less than the first peak. The size of the second wave depends sensitively on the loss of immunity and the efficacy of Find-Test-Trace-Isolate-Support programmes. In summary, accounting for heterogeneity of exposure, susceptibility and transmission suggests that the next wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will be much smaller than conventional models predict, with less economic and health disruption. This heterogeneity means that seroprevalence underestimates effective herd immunity and, crucially, the potential of public health programmes.","Friston, Karl; Costello, Anthony; Pillay, Deenan",BMJ Glob Health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-003978; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33328201/,264

This contact with conspecifics is essential for their evolution and survival. Among the recommendations to reduce transmission of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for COVID-19 are social distancing and home confinement. These measures may negatively affect the social life and, consequently, the emotional state and eating behavior of individuals. We assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the anxiety, premenstrual symptoms, and eating behavior of young women. Data collection was conducted in person (prepandemic—from March to December 2019) and online (during the pandemic—August 2020). A total of 71 participants, average age of 21.26 years (SD = 0.41), took part in the study. Trait anxiety during the pandemic was significantly lower than in the prepandemic period. Investigation of the “anxiety/stress” symptom of the Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool (PSST) revealed that this symptom was more severe before the pandemic. There was a decline in the desire for sweet and fatty foods during the pandemic. However, craving for traditional foods rose significantly in the same period. Uncontrolled and emotional eating were significantly lower during the pandemic. The results suggest that the pandemic may have had a positive impact on anxiety and eating behavior of the participants, which may be due to differences between urban and rural populations and the latter living with their families. These findings are important for raising a discussion regarding the effects of the current environment on the regulation of cognitive and dietary adaptations.","Freitas, Fernanda da Fonseca; de Medeiros, Anna Cecília Queiroz; Lopes, Fívia de Araújo",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.645754; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140913/,264

Given that forensic pathology is responsible for investigating deaths that are sudden, unexplained, or unattended by a physician, its participation in mortality and disease surveillance contributes data useful to clinicians and epidemiologists. The data provides demographic details, the extent of disease, and causes of death. Utilizing forensic pathology data provides a wealth of information that helps understand the Covid-19 disease and inform public health policy. This paper aims to describe the role of forensic pathology in the COVID-19 pandemic era in Zambia.With the confirmation of the first COVID-19 cases in Zambia, the forensic pathology service developed a screening tool for probable detection of COVID-19 infections in brought-in-dead cases undergoing forensic autopsies at the University Teaching Hospital. The screened cases were tested for COVID-19. Notably, most of the COVID-19 deaths recorded in Zambia are from the BID that were tested.During the COVID-19 pandemic, autopsies were conducted using forensic pathology principles to determine the cause of death and document the extent of disease, thus contributing to the body of knowledge in public health and infectious disease science COVID-19.In conclusion, the forensic pathology service has contributed to the management of patients infected with COVID-19. It has also been useful to public health through mortality and disease surveillance of broughtin- dead cases.

611377,Low Dose Radiation Therapy and Convalescent Plasma: How a Hybrid Method May Maximize Benefits for COVID-19 Patients.,2020-08-01,"With extremely short generation times and high mutability, many viruses can rapidly evolve and adapt to changing environments. This ability is generally beneficial to viruses as it allows them to evade host immune responses, evolve new behaviours, and exploit ecological niches. However, natural selection typically generates adaptation in response to the immediate selection pressures that a virus experiences in its current host. Consequently, we argue that some viruses, particularly those characterised by long durations of infection and ongoing replication, may be susceptible to short-sighted evolution, whereby a virus’ adaptation to its current host will be detrimental to its onward transmission within the host population. Here we outline the concept of short-sighted viral evolution and provide examples of how it may negatively impact viral transmission among hosts. We also propose that viruses that are vulnerable to short-sighted evolution may exhibit strategies that minimise its effects. We speculate on the various mechanisms by which this may be achieved, including viral life history strategies that result in low rates of within-host evolution, or the establishment of a ‘germline’ lineage of viruses that avoids short-sighted evolution. These concepts provide a new perspective on the way in which some viruses have been able to establish and maintain global pandemics.","Lythgoe, Katrina A.; Gardner, Andy; Pybus, Oliver G.; Grove, Joe",Trends Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2017.03.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0966842X17300550; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966842X17300550; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28377208/,264

Our intent was to evaluate the nitrogen accretion response to varying protein intakes for critically ill ventilator-dependent patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) with COVID-19, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and who required mechanical ventilation were retrospectively evaluated. Patients received continuous enteral nutrition (EN), including supplemental protein boluses, and had a 24-h urine collection for determination of nitrogen balance (NBAL). Data are expressed as mean ± SD with a P-value < .05 as significant. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients provided 29 NBAL determinations. Protein intake from EN and protein supplements was 0.9 ± 0.7 g/kg/day at the time of the NBAL with an NBAL of -12.1 ± 10.9 g/day at 7 ± 4 days in the ICU. Combined caloric intake from EN and propofol at the time of the NBAL was 12 ± 8 kcal/kg/day. Nitrogen equilibrium (NBAL of -4 g/day or better) occurred in five patients. Patients achieving nitrogen equilibrium received more protein than those with a negative NBAL (1.2 ± 0.4 g/kg/day vs 0.8 ± 0.8 g/kg/day, P = .046). The linear regression for NBAL in response to graded increases in protein intake was as follows: NBAL = 8.5 × protein intake (g/kg/day) - 18.8 (r = 0.450, P < .001). CONCLUSION: Critically ill ventilator-dependent patients with COVID-19 exhibit significant variability in nitrogen accretion response to increases in protein intake and often have a markedly negative NBAL.","Buckley, Christopher T; Prasanna, Nivedita; Mays, Abby L; Tinsley, Jeanette M; Dickerson, Roland N",Nutr Clin Pract,https://doi.org/10.1002/ncp.10763; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34468046/,264

Chemical reactivity, kinetic and thermodynamic studies were investigated using DFT method. The possible binding mode between L(TA) and Main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 and their reactivity were studied using molecular docking simulation. Single crystal X-ray diffraction showed that L(TA) crystallizes in a monoclinic system with P2(1) space group. The reactivity descriptors such as nucleophilic index confirm that L(TA) is more nucleophile, inducing complexation with binding species like biomolecules. The kinetic and thermodynamic parameters showed that the mechanism of crystal formation is moderately exothermic. The binding energy of the SARS-CoV-2/Mpro-L(TA) complex and the calculated inhibition constant using docking simulation showed that the active L(TA) molecule has the ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2.","AIT-RAMDANE-TERBOUCHE, Chafia; ABDELDJEBAR, Hasnia; TERBOUCHE, Achour; LAKHDARI, Houria; BACHARI, Khaldoun; ROISNEL, Thierry; HAUCHARD, Didier",J Mol Struct,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022286020312436; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834114/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022286020312436?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2020.128918,264

In response, there have been calls for trade bans involving key components of the global commercial wildlife trade, and some major policy decisions involving trade bans have ensued. Yet, these actions have been criticised, largely based on concerns that they risk exacerbating poverty, undermining human rights, damaging conservation incentives, and otherwise harming sustainable development and conservation efforts. Instead, many critics propose improved regulation of the status quo, with the intention of nurturing a legal, sustainable, safe, humane, and equitable wildlife trade. Here, we provide a countering view that draws attention to: (1) why the risks presented by the wildlife trade (to animal welfare, biodiversity, public health, and financial security) are manifold, and cannot be treated with complacency; (2) why the goal of a legal, sustainable, safe, humane, and equitable wildlife trade is misleading and unachievable; and (3) why moving towards an end to the commercial trade in wildlife should be our ultimate and more ambitious goal. We hope to stimulate further discussion on this issue both within the sustainability research and policy domains, identifying a path towards consensus on how best to protect wildlife, people, and planet. ABSTRACT: The Covid-19 outbreak has brought about fresh and intensified scrutiny of the wildlife trade, which substantively involves commerce in exotic pets. In response, major policy decisions involving trade bans have ensued, with calls for similar such action to be applied across the trade chain. Yet, these measures have been criticised, largely based on concerns that they risk exacerbating poverty, undermining human rights, damaging conservation incentives, and otherwise harming sustainable development and conservation efforts. Instead, many critics propose improved regulation of the status quo, with the intention of nurturing a legal, sustainable, safe, humane, and equitable wildlife trade. Herein, we provide a countering view that outlines how the risks presented by the wildlife trade are becoming increasingly recognised as being both manifold and severe; and raise concerns that the goal of a well-regulated wildlife trade is becoming increasingly exposed as a mirage. We conclude that while pursuing the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (with their focus on poverty alleviation, food security, public health, and conservation) is enduringly vital, a flourishing wildlife trade is not. Given that the exploitation of wildlife, including for the pet trade, has been identified as one of the dominant drivers of biodiversity loss, emergence of zoonotic infectious disease, animal suffering, and financial instability, perpetuating the concept of utilising a regulated wildlife trade as the default approach to protect people and planet is in urgent need of re-evaluation.","D’Cruze, Neil; Green, Jennah; Elwin, Angie; Schmidt-Burbach, Jan",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33371486/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ani10122456,264

Rehabilitation services were highly disrupted during the Covid-19 pandemic. Aim: To understand rehabilitation provision in palliative care services during the Covid-19 pandemic, identifying and reflecting on adaptative and innovative practice to inform ongoing provision. Design: Cross-sectional national online survey. Setting/participants: Rehabilitation leads for specialist palliative care services across hospice, hospital, or community settings, conducted from 30/07/20 to 21/09/2020. Findings: 61 completed responses (England, n=55; Scotland, n=4; Wales, n=1; and Northern Ireland, n=1) most frequently from services based in hospices (56/61, 92%) providing adult rehabilitation. Most services (55/61, 90%) reported rehabilitation provision becoming remote during Covid-19 and half reported reduced caseloads. Rehabilitation teams frequently had staff members on sick-leave with suspected/confirmed Covid-19 (27/61, 44%), redeployed to other services/organisations (25/61, 41%) or furloughed (15/61, 26%). Free text responses were constructed into four themes: (i) fluctuating shared spaces; (ii) remote and digitised rehabilitation offer; (iii) capacity to provide and participate in rehabilitation; (iv) Covid-19 as a springboard for positive change. These represent how rehabilitation services contracted, reconfigured, and were redirected to more remote modes of delivery, and how this affected the capacity of clinicians and patients to participate in rehabilitation. Conclusion: This study demonstrates how changes in provision of rehabilitation during the pandemic could act as a springboard for positive changes. Hybrid models of rehabilitation have the potential to expand the equity of access and reach of rehabilitation within specialist palliative care.","Bayly, J.; Bradshaw, A.; Fettes, L.; Omarjee, M.; Talbot-Rice, H.; Walshe, C.; Sleeman, K.

Since most of current investigations for virus-host interaction are based on cell level, there is an urgent demand to probe tissue-specific features associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on collected proteomic datasets from human lung, colon, kidney, liver and heart, we constructed a virus-receptor network, a virus-interaction network and a virus-perturbation network. In the tissue-specific networks associated with virus-host crosstalk, both common and different key hubs are revealed in diverse tissues. Ubiquitous hubs in multiple tissues such as BRD4 and RIPK1 would be promising drug targets to rescue multi-organ injury and deal with inflammation. Certain tissue-unique hubs such as REEP5 might mediate specific olfactory dysfunction. The present analysis implies that SARS-CoV-2 could affect multi-targets in diverse host tissues, and the treatment of COVID-19 would be a complex task.","Feng, Li; Yin, Yuan-Yuan; Liu, Cong-Hui; Xu, Ke-Ren; Li, Qing-Run; Wu, Jia-Rui; Zeng, Rong",J Mol Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32642770/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jmcb/mjaa033,264
618287,Recognized and Potentially New Biomarkers—Their Role in Diagnosis and Prognosis of Cardiovascular Disease,2021-07-08,"In comparison with the pervasive use of protein dimers and multimers in all domains of life, functional RNA oligomers have so far rarely been observed in nature. Their diminished occurrence contrasts starkly with the robust intrinsic potential of RNA to multimerize through long-range base-pairing (“kissing”) interactions, self-annealing of palindromic or complementary sequences, and stable tertiary contact motifs, such as the GNRA tetraloop-receptors. To explore the general mechanics of RNA dimerization, we performed a meta-analysis of a collection of exemplary RNA homodimer structures consisting of viral genomic elements, ribozymes, riboswitches, etc., encompassing both functional and fortuitous dimers. Globally, we found that domain-swapped dimers and antiparallel, head-to-tail arrangements are predominant architectural themes. Locally, we observed that the same structural motifs, interfaces and forces that enable tertiary RNA folding also drive their higher-order assemblies. These feature prominently long-range kissing loops, pseudoknots, reciprocal base intercalations and A-minor interactions. We postulate that the scarcity of functional RNA multimers and limited diversity in multimerization motifs may reflect evolutionary constraints imposed by host antiviral immune surveillance and stress sensing. A deepening mechanistic understanding of RNA multimerization is expected to facilitate investigations into RNA and RNP assemblies, condensates, and granules and enable their potential therapeutical targeting.","Bou-Nader, Charles; Zhang, Jinwei",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32585844/; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25122881,264

In Shenzhen, 465 patients were confirmed to have COVID-19 as of August 31, 2020. In the present study, we aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Shenzhen and identify risk factors for the development of viral sepsis. Methods: In this retrospective study, patients who were confirmed to have a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and were admitted to the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen from January 11 to April 27, 2020 were included in the cohort. Clinical data were extracted and followed up to May 10, 2020, by using predesigned data collection forms. Results: A total of 422 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were enrolled in this study, including 97 (23%) patients with viral sepsis at hospital admission and 325 (77%) non-septic patients. Patients with sepsis were much older than those without sepsis (57 vs. 43 years, P < 0.001) and presented with more comorbidities. Septic patients showed multiple organ dysfunction and significant abnormalities in immune- and inflammation-related biomarkers, and had poorer outcomes when compared to those without sepsis. Increased levels of interleukin-6, blood urea nitrogen, and creatine kinase were associated with the development of SARS-CoV-2-induced sepsis, and an elevated production of interleukin-6 was found to be an independent risk factor for the progression to critical illness among septic COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced sepsis is critically involved in the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 patients by characterizing both aberrant immune response and uncontrolled inflammation. The development of sepsis might contribute to multiple organ dysfunction and poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients during hospitalization.","Ren, Chao; Yao, Ren-qi; Ren, Di; Li, Jin-xiu; Li, Ying; Liu, Xue-yan; Huang, Lei; Liu, Yong; Peng, Mian; Yao, Yao; Feng, Yong-wen; Yao, Yong-ming",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33178716/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.570853,264

In the first month of the pandemic there was a global shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), thereby causing a rise in infection cases and deaths among healthcare workers (HCWs) in some countries. Moreover, the PPE used in hospitals today is not designed for prolonged use, and causes problems such as headaches and vision difficulties. To address these problems, a case study of an active PPE system for HCWs that is based on 3D printing and the use of ready-made parts is presented here. This case study demonstrates a new approach toward the design and manufacturing of PPE in emergency situations that relies on rapid development and domestic manufacturing of products through 3D printing technologies. The system was developed during the first months of the pandemic under restrictive quarantine conditions, and was fabricated and then tested by HCWs at several hospitals.

PURPOSE: The implementation of a pharmacist-managed transition of care program for kidney transplant recipients with posttransplant hyperglycemia (PTHG) is described. METHODS: In September 2015, a collaborative practice agreement between pharmacists and transplant providers at an academic medical center for management of PTHG was developed. The goal of the pharmacist-run service was to reduce hospitalizations by providing care to patients in the acute phase of hyperglycemia while they transitioned back to their primary care provider or endocrinologist. For continuous quality improvement, preimplementation data were collected from August 2014 to August 2015 and compared to postimplementation data collected from August 2017 to August 2018. The primary endpoint was hospitalizations due to hyperglycemia within 90 days post transplantation. Secondary endpoints included emergency department (ED) visits due to hypoglycemia and the number of interventions performed, number of encounters completed, and number of ED visits or admissions for hypoglycemia. A Fisher’s exact test was used to compare categorical data, and a Student t test was used to compare continuous data. A P value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. RESULTS: Forty-three patients in the preimplementation group were compared to 35 patients in the postimplementation group. There was a significant reduction in hospitalizations due to hyperglycemia in the postimplementation versus the preimplementation group (9 vs 1, P < 0.05); there was a reduction in ED visits due to hyperglycemia (5 vs 0, P = 0.06). There were no ED visits or hospitalizations due to hypoglycemia in either group. Clinical transplant pharmacists performed an average of 8.3 (SD, 4.4) encounters per patient per 90 days. CONCLUSION: A collaborative practice agreement was created and successfully implemented. A pharmacist-managed PTHG program could be incorporated into the standard care of kidney transplant recipients to help minimize rehospitalizations due to hyperglycemia.","Do, Vincent; Haakinson, Danielle; Belfort De Aguiar, Renata; Cohen, Elizabeth",Am J Health Syst Pharm,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33821878/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxab151,264

622346,COVID-19: Is a paradigm change to be expected in health care and transfusion medicine?,2020-03-31,"Background Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a multifunctional molecule that plays a nonredundant role at the crossroads between pathogen clearance, innate immune system, matrix deposition, female fertility, and vascular biology. It is produced at sites of infection and inflammation by both structural and inflammatory cells. However, its role in allergen-induced inflammation remains to be tested. Objective We sought to determine the effect of Ptx3 deletion on ovalbumin (OVA)–induced allergic inflammation in a murine model of asthma. Methods Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected from patients with severe asthma and healthy subjects, and the level of PTX3 was determined by using ELISA. Ptx3 +/+ and Ptx3 −/− mice were sensitized and challenged with OVA and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and the lungs were collected for assessing inflammation. Lung tissue inflammation and mucus production were assessed by means of flow cytometry and hematoxylin and eosin and periodic acid-Schiff staining, respectively. flexiVent was used to determine airway resistance to methacholine in these mice. Results Here we report that mice with severe asthma and OVA-sensitized/challenged mice had increased PTX3 levels in the lungs compared with healthy control mice. Mice lacking PTX3 have exaggerated neutrophilic/eosinophilic lung inflammation, mucus production, and airway hyperresponsiveness in an experimental model of OVA-induced asthma. Furthermore, OVA-exposed lung Ptx3 −/− CD4 T cells exhibit an increased production of IL-17A, an effect that is accompanied by an increased signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 phosphorylation, reduced IL-2 production, and enhanced activation and survival. Also, we observed an increase in numbers of IL-6– and IL-23–producing dendritic cells in OVA-exposed Ptx3 −/− mice compared with those in wild-type control mice. Conclusion Altogether, PTX3 deficiency results in augmented airway hyperresponsiveness, mucus production, and IL-17A–dominant pulmonary inflammation, suggesting a regulatory role of PTX3 in the development of allergic inflammation.","Balhara, Jyoti; Shan, Lianyu; Zhang, Jingbo; Muhuri, Anik; Halayko, Andrew J.; Almiski, Muhamad S.; Doeing, Diana; McConville, John; Matzuk, Martin M.; Gounni, Abdelilah S.",Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674916307023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27567326/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2016.04.063; http://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091674916307023/pdf; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674916307023,264

TGEV infection has emerged as a major cause of severe gastroenteritis and leads to alterations of many cellular processes. Meanwhile, the pathogenic mechanism of TGEV is still unclear. microRNAs (miRNAs) are a novel class of small non-coding RNAs which are involved in the regulation of numerous biological processes such as viral infection and cell apoptosis. Accumulating data show that miRNAs are involved in the process of coronavirus infection such as replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). However, the link between miRNAs and TGEV infection is unknown. In this study, we performed microRNA microarray assay and predicted targets of altered miRNAs. The results showed TGEV infection caused the change of miRNAs profile. Then we selected miR-4331 for further analysis and subsequently identified cell division cycle-associated protein 7 (CDCA7) as the target of miR-4331. Moreover, miR-4331 showed the ability to inhibit transcription of TGEV gene 7 (a non-structure gene) via directly targeting CDCA7. In conclusion, differentially expressed miR-4331 that is caused by TGEV infection can suppress transcription of TGEV gene 7 via targeting cellular CDCA7. Our key finding is that TGEV selectively manipulates the expression of some cellular miRNAs to regulate its subgenomic transcription.","Song, Xiangjun; Zhao, Xiaomin; Huang, Yong; Xiang, Hailing; Zhang, Wenlong; Tong, Dewen",Int J Biol Sci,https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.11585; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26157346/,264

625389,Sex-Related Differences in Dilated Cardiomyopathy with a Focus on Cardiac Dysfunction in Oncology,2020-08-08,"The most severe and fatal infections with SARS-CoV-2 result in the acute respiratory distress syndrome, a clinical phenotype of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that is associated with virions targeting the epithelium of the distal lung, particularly the facultative progenitors of this tissue, alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AT2s). Little is known about the initial responses of human lung alveoli to SARS-CoV-2 infection due in part to inability to access these cells from patients, particularly at early stages of disease. Here we present an in vitro human model that simulates the initial apical infection of the distal lung epithelium with SARS-CoV-2, using AT2s that have been adapted to air-liquid interface culture after their derivation from induced pluripotent stem cells (iAT2s). We find that SARS-CoV-2 induces a rapid global transcriptomic change in infected iAT2s characterized by a shift to an inflammatory phenotype predominated by the secretion of cytokines encoded by NF-kB target genes, delayed epithelial interferon responses, and rapid loss of the mature lung alveolar epithelial program. Over time, infected iAT2s exhibit cellular toxicity that can result in the death of these key alveolar facultative progenitors, as is observed in vivo in COVID-19 lung autopsies. Importantly, drug testing using iAT2s confirmed the efficacy of TMPRSS2 protease inhibition, validating putative mechanisms used for viral entry in human alveolar cells. Our model system reveals the cell-intrinsic responses of a key lung target cell to infection, providing a platform for further drug development and facilitating a deeper understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.","Huang, Jessie; Hume, Adam J.; Abo, Kristine M.; Werder, Rhiannon B.; Villacorta-Martin, Carlos; Alysandratos, Konstantinos-Dionysios; Beermann, Mary Lou; Simone-Roach, Chantelle; Olejnik, Judith; Suder, Ellen L.; Bullitt, Esther; Hinds, Anne; Sharma, Arjun; Bosmann, Markus; Wang, Ruobing; Hawkins, Finn; Burks, Eric J.; Saeed, Mohsan; Wilson, Andrew A.; Mühlberger, Elke; Kotton, Darrell N.",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32637964/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.30.175695,264

CONCLUSION: According to most publications, although ageism has always been present, it became more evident during the COVID-19 pandemic as a form of discrimination against older adults. “Ageist” discourses may exert a negative influence in older adults’ lives, causing severe social and psychological impacts.","Silva, Marcela Fernandes; da Silva, Diego Salvador Muniz; Bacurau, Aldiane Gomes de Macedo; Francisco, Priscila Maria Stolses Bergamo; de Assumpção, Daniela; Neri, Anita Liberalesso; Borim, Flávia Silva Arbex",Revista de saude publica,https://doi.org/10.11606/s1518-8787.2021055003082; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33886953/,264

The combined hypo‐ and hyper‐reward responses results in a reward imbalance, which has been noted as a relevant maintenance factor for eating disorders (EDs) characterized by binge eating. This registered report describes the protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing supportive therapy to a novel treatment targeting reward imbalance (Reward Re‐Training; RRT) for individuals with binge eating. Aims of the current study include to confirm feasibility and acceptability of RRT, to evaluate the ability of RRT to engage critical targets, and to provide preliminary estimates of efficacy in reducing ED symptoms at both posttreatment and 3‐month follow‐up. Sixty participants will be randomized to either RRT or supportive therapy. For both conditions, treatment will be delivered in 10 weekly group outpatient therapy sessions conducted remotely using videoconferencing software. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, mid‐treatment, posttreatment, and 3‐month follow‐up to measure feasibility, acceptability, critical treatment targets (i.e., reward to day‐to‐day life activities, reward to palatable foods, social isolation, and loneliness), and ED symptoms.","Juarascio, Adrienne S.; Michael, Megan L.; Srivastava, Paakhi; Manasse, Stephanie M.; Drexler, Sarah; Felonis, Christina R.",Int J Eat Disord,https://doi.org/10.1002/eat.23528; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33908655/,264
625979,ANA Webinars: Clinical and basic research resilience during COVID‐19,2020-12-15,"The recent emergence of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has led to the global pandemic of the severe disease COVID-19 in humans. While efforts to quickly identify effective antiviral therapies have focused largely on repurposing existing drugs1–4, the current standard of care, remdesivir, remains the only authorized antiviral intervention of COVID-19 and provides only modest clinical benefits5. Here we show that water-soluble derivatives of α-tocopherol have potent antiviral activity and synergize with remdesivir as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Through an artificial-intelligence-driven in silico screen and in vitro viral inhibition assay, we identified D-α-tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS) as an effective antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 and β-coronaviruses more broadly that also displays strong synergy with remdesivir. We subsequently determined that TPGS and other water-soluble derivatives of α-tocopherol inhibit the transcriptional activity of purified SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and identified affinity binding sites for these compounds within a conserved, hydrophobic interface between SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 7 and nonstructural protein 8 that is functionally implicated in the assembly of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp6. In summary, we conclude that solubilizing modifications to α-tocopherol allow it to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, making it an effective antiviral molecule alone and even more so in combination with remdesivir. These findings are significant given that many tocopherol derivatives, including TPGS, are considered safe for humans, orally bioavailable, and dramatically enhance the activity of the only approved antiviral for SARS-CoV-2 infection7–9.","Pacl, Hayden T.; Tipper, Jennifer L.; Sevalkar, Ritesh R.; Crouse, Andrew; Crowder, Camerron; Ahmad, Shama; Ahmad, Aftab; Holder, Gillian D.; Kuhlman, Charles J.; Chinta, Krishna C.; Nadeem, Sajid; Green, Todd J.; Petit, Chad M.; Steyn, Adrie J.C.; Might, Matthew; Harrod, Kevin S.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.13.449251; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34282419/,264

627975,Acute macular neuroretinopathy following Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination,2021-09-01,"CONTEXT: People who have recently recovered from the threat of deteriorating coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) have antibodies to the coronavirus circulating in their blood. Thus, the transfusion of these antibodies to deteriorating patients could theoretically help boost their immune system. Biologically, two challenges need to be surmounted to allow convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion to rescue the most severe COVID-19 patients. First, convalescent subjects must meet donor selection plasma criteria and comply with national health requirements and known standard routine procedures. Second, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems should be considered in the selection of the most suitable CP and the prioritisation of patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents a rescue framework for the transfusion of the best CP to the most critical patients with COVID-19 on the basis of biological requirements by using machine learning and novel MCDM methods. METHOD: The proposed framework is illustrated on the basis of two distinct and consecutive phases (i.e. testing and development). In testing, ABO compatibility is assessed after classifying donors into the four blood types, namely, A, B, AB and O, to indicate the suitability and safety of plasma for administration in order to refine the CP tested list repository. The development phase includes patient and donor sides. In the patient side, prioritisation is performed using a contracted patient decision matrix constructed between ‘serological/protein biomarkers and the ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood to fractional inspired oxygen criteria’ and ‘patient list based on novel MCDM method known as subjective and objective decision by opinion score method’. Then, the patients with the most urgent need are classified into the four blood types and matched with a tested CP list from the test phase in the donor side. Thereafter, the prioritisation of CP tested list is performed using the contracted CP decision matrix. RESULT: An intelligence-integrated concept is proposed to identify the most appropriate CP for corresponding prioritised patients with COVID-19 to help doctors hasten treatments. DISCUSSION: The proposed framework implies the benefits of providing effective care and prevention of the extremely rapidly spreading COVID-19 from affecting patients and the medical sector.","Albahri, O.S.; Al-Obaidi, Jameel R.; Zaidan, A.A.; Albahri, A.S.; Zaidan, B.B.; Sali, M.M.; Abdlhadi, A.; Dawood, K.A.; Mohammed, R.T.; Abdulkareem, Karrar Hameed; Aleesa, A.M.; Alamoodi, A.H.; Chyad, M.A.; Zulkifli, Che Zalina",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2020.105617; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32593060/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260720314504?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0169260720314504,264

Since then, several measures to limit virus transmission have been imposed; among them, home confinement has been the most severe, with drastic changes in the daily routines of the general population. The “stay at home” rule has impaired healthcare service access, and patients with chronic conditions were the most exposed to the negative effects of this limitation. There is strong evidence of the worsening of obesity and diabetes mellitus in children during this period. To overcome these issues, healthcare providers have changed their clinical practice to ensure follow-up visits and medical consultation though the use of telemedicine. Telemedicine, including telephone calls, videocalls, data platforms of shared telemedicine data platforms mitigated the negative effect of pandemic restrictions. Published evidence has documented good metabolic control and weight management outcomes in centers that performed extensive telemedicine services last year during the pandemic.

With this study, we performed a systematic review of the literature and ongoing clinical trials on convalescent plasma therapy in pediatric patients with COVID-19. The electronic databases Medline PubMed, Scopus, and Web Of Science were searched. Also, clinical trials registries were searched for potentially eligible studies. A total of 90 records were retrieved after duplicate removal. Eight studies were case reports of children treated with convalescent plasma therapy (14 children, age range, 9 weeks to 18 years); 5 children had a chronic disease. During the hospital stay, 5 received drugs (e.g., remdesivir) in addition to convalescent plasma therapy. No convalescent plasma therapy-related adverse events were reported in 5 studies and 3 made no mention of adverse events. Seven studies concluded that convalescent plasma therapy is or could be a useful therapeutic option; one study made no claims. Only 3 of the 13 retrieved trials underway were planned exclusively for children. This is the first systematic review of the literature regarding convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19 in children. We found insufficient clinical information on the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy in children.

We examined the agreement in SARS-CoV-2 detection between two types of self-collected samples: nasal swabs (NS) and saliva (SA). Figure 1. Bland-Altman plot of SARS-CoV-2-N1 CT values for SA and NS samples [Image: see text] Figure 2. Bland-Altman plot of SARS-CoV-2-N2 CT values for SA and NS samples [Image: see text] METHODS: Paired daily self-collected NS and SA samples were collected in May 2020 in an ongoing case-ascertained study of SARS-CoV-2 household transmission in Nashville, TN. After informed consent was obtained, index cases and household members were remotely trained in the self-collection of daily nasal swabs (from both nares and preserved in transport medium) and saliva samples (participants were asked to spit in a sterile urine cup approximately 6 times during a minute). Samples were refrigerated in closed double bags and delivered to the laboratory within ~72–96 hours of collection. NS and SA samples were tested using qRT-PCR at a research laboratory. We computed the agreement in detections between sample types using the McNemar test and compared median qRT-PCR cycle threshold (CT) values between sample types for 2 targets (SARS-CoV-2-N1 and SARS-CoV-2-N2) using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. Bland-Altman plots were used to visually inspect agreement between NS and SA CT values. RESULTS: Among 144 self-collected samples (72 pairs) from 13 unique participants (5 index cases and 8 household members), there were 30 pairs with concordant positive detections in both sample types, 35 with concordant negative detections in both samples, 1 pair with positive NS only, and 6 pairs with positive SA only. The overall agreement between NS and SA was 90.3% (p=0.1). The median SARS-CoV-2-N1 CT value for NS samples was 33.3 (interquartile range: 30.2–35.3) and for SA samples was 30.5 (29.8–33.3, p=0.04); the median CT value for SARS-CoV-2-N2 was 34.4 (31.5–37.5) and 31.5 (30.4–34.9), respectively (p=0.01). Bland-Altman plots indicated that most observations were contained within the limits of agreement but suggested NS tended to have higher CT values than SA samples (Figures). CONCLUSION: Self-collection of saliva samples provides a simple, non-invasive, and practical strategy for identification of SARS-CoV-2 infections. DISCLOSURES: Carlos G.

629729,TIM-3 as a potential exhaustion marker in CD4+ T cells of COVID-19 patients,2021,"Interferon lambda (IFN-λ) is an antiviral naturally produced in response to viral infections, with activity on cells of epithelial origin and located in the mucosal surfaces. This localized activity results in reduced toxicity compared to type I IFNs, whose receptors are ubiquitously expressed. IFN-λ has been effective in the therapy of respiratory viral infections, playing a crucial role in potentiating adaptive immune responses that initiate at mucosal surfaces. Human IFN-λ has polymorphisms that may cause differences in the interaction with the specific receptor in the human population. Interestingly, bovine IFN-λ3 has an in silico-predicted higher affinity for the human receptor than its human counterparts, with high identity with different human IFN-λ variants, making it a suitable antiviral therapeutic candidate for human health. Here, we demonstrate that a recombinant bovine IFN-λ (rbIFN-λ) produced in HEK-293 cells is effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection of VERO cells, with an inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) between 30 and 50 times lower than that of human type I IFN tested here (α2b and β1a). We also demonstrated the absence of toxicity of rbIFN-λ in human PBMCs and the lack of proinflammatory activity on these cells. Altogether, our results show that rbIFN-λ is as an effective antiviral potentially suitable for COVID-19 therapy. Among other potential applications, rbIFN-λ could be useful to preclude virus dispersion to the lungs and/or to reduce transmission from infected people. Moreover, and due to the non-specific activity of this IFN, it can be potentially effective against other respiratory viruses that may be circulating together with SARS-CoV-2.","Cardoso, Nancy Patricia; Mansilla, Florencia Celeste; Benedetti, Estefanía; Turco, Cecilia Soledad; Barone, Lucas José; Iserte, Javier Alonso; Soria, Ivana; Baumeister, Elsa; Capozzo, Alejandra Victoria",Front Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33240967/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2020.603622,264

The nomenclature to design the variants uses a colloquial form referred to the country or place of detection, a code from the “Pangolin” database and one from the “Nextstrain” page. New variants that have spread include the British B.1.1.7 (20I/501Y.V1), the South African B.1.351 (20H/501.V2), the Brazilian P.1 (20J/501Y.V3), the Californians B.1.427 B.1.429 (20C/S:452R) and the most recent, the Indian B.1.617 (VUI-21APR-01). The gold standard for the identification of the variants is whole genome sequencing. However, real-time PCR techniques have already been developed for the detection of specific mutations that can facilitate their presumptive identification. The impact of these variants on global vaccination programs has raised concern. It is generally thought that, since the response evoked by the vaccine against the S antigen is directed at the entire protein and the mutations only affect specific regions, the escape effect of the vaccine antibodies will be limited. Among the future strategies proposed for immuno-protection, the increase in the number of doses, the alternation of vaccines and the development of specific vaccines against different variants has been suggested.","Pérez-Abeledo, Marta; Sanz, Juan Carlos",Vacunas,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1576988721000406; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34276267/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1576988721000406?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vacun.2021.06.003,264

This innovative idea is so recent that it requires further attention and debate. The significant role played by vimentin in virus-induced infection however is well established: (1) vimentin has been reported as a co-receptor and/or attachment site for SARS-CoV; (2) vimentin is involved in viral replication in cells; (3) vimentin plays a fundamental role in both the viral infection and the consequent explosive immune-inflammatory response and (4) a lower vimentin expression is associated with the inhibition of epithelial to mesenchymal transition and fibrosis. Moreover, the absence of vimentin in mice makes them resistant to lung injury. Since vimentin has a twofold role in the disease, not only being involved in the viral infection but also in the associated life-threatening lung inflammation, the use of vimentin-targeted drugs may offer a synergistic advantage as compared with other treatments not targeting vimentin. Consequently, we speculate here that drugs which decrease the expression of vimentin can be used for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 and advise that several Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs be immediately tested in clinical trials against SARS-CoV-2, thus broadening therapeutic options for this type of viral infection.","Li, Zhenlin; Paulin, Denise; Lacolley, Patrick; Coletti, Dario; Agbulut, Onnik",BMJ Open Respir Res,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjresp-2020-000623; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32913008/,264

AIM OF THE STUDY The present work aims to elucidate the protective effects and the possible mechanism of XFBD against the acute inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis. METHODS We use TGF-β1 induced fibroblast activation model and LPS/IL-4 induced macrophage inflammation model as in vitro cell models. The mice model of lung fibrosis was induced by BLM via endotracheal drip, and XFBD (4.6, 9.2 g/kg) were administered orally after BLM. The efficacy and molecular mechanisms in the presence or absence of XFBD were investigated. RESULTS The results proved that XFBD can effectively inhibit fibroblast collagen deposition, Down-regulate the level of α-SMA and inhibit the migration of fibroblasts. IL-4 induced macrophage polarization was also inhibited and the secretions of the inflammatory factors including IL6, iNOS were down-regulated. In vivo experiments, the results proved that XFBD improved the weight loss and survival rate of the mice. The XFBD high-dose administration group had a significant effect in inhibiting collagen deposition and the expression of α-SMA in the lungs of mice. XFBD can reduce bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting IL-6/STAT3 activation and related macrophage infiltration. CONCLUSIONS Xuanfei Baidu Decoction protects against macrophages produced inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis via inhibiting IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway.","Wang, Yuying; Sang, Xiaoqing; Shao, Rui; Qin, Honglin; Chen, Xuanhao; Xue, Zhifeng; Li, Lin; Wang, Yu; Zhu, Yan; Chang, Yanxu; Gao, Xiumei; Zhang, Boli; Zhang, Han; Yang, Jian",Journal of ethnopharmacology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34606948/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2021.114701,264

RESULTS: Among 3199 responders (72.1%), we analyzed the data of 2304 residents who provided complete answers to the KCL and SNAQ and on ICT use, voluntary exercise, polypharmacy, and families. The mean age was 79.7 years (51.3% male). The percentages of frailty assessed by the KCL, voluntary exercise, and low SNAQ scores (≤14) were 16.0%, 61.4%, and 43.8% in 808 ICT users and 30.3%, 47.2%, and 54.1% in 1496 ICT non-users, respectively (p<0.001). ICT use was significantly associated with voluntary exercise even during social restriction, independent of age, sex, polypharmacy, low SNAQ scores, and frailty status (odds ratio, 1.503; 95% confidential interval, 1.246–1.813). CONCLUSION: Older ICT users are more active to maintain health even during social restriction, independent of frailty status.","Satake, Shosuke; Kinoshita, K.; Arai, H.",J Nutr Health Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33786570/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12603-021-1598-2,264
632071,Lung cancer patients and COVID-19 epidemic: an experience from an Italian university hospital,2020-06-05,"Empirical studies show that epidemiological models based on an epidemic’s initial spread rate often fail to predict the true scale of that epidemic. Most epidemics with a rapid early rise die out before affecting a significant fraction of the population, whereas the early pace of some pandemics is rather modest. Recent models suggest that this could be due to the heterogeneity of the target population’s susceptibility. We study a computer malware ecosystem exhibiting spread mechanisms resembling those of biological systems while offering details unavailable for human epidemics. Rather than comparing models, we directly estimate reach from a new and vastly more complete data from a parallel domain, that offers superior details and insight as concerns biological outbreaks. We find a highly heterogeneous distribution of computer susceptibilities, with nearly all outbreaks initially over-affecting the tail of the distribution, then collapsing quickly once this tail is depleted. This mechanism restricts the correlation between an epidemic’s initial growth rate and its total reach, thus preventing the majority of epidemics, including initially fast-growing outbreaks, from reaching a macroscopic fraction of the population. The few pervasive malwares distinguish themselves early on via the following key trait: they avoid infecting the tail, while preferentially targeting computers unaffected by typical malware.","Muchnik, Lev; Yom-Tov, Elad; Levy, Nir; Rubin, Amir; Louzoun, Yoram",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34083697/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91321-0,264

Community social capital refers to a set of norms of reciprocity, trust, and civic engagement networks that promote trust, reciprocal help, and cooperation for mutual benefits. It is also suggested that it can help alleviate negative effects of the pandemic in communities, by reducing uncertainty and its harmful effects on cooperation. These hypotheses were tested in a sample of 565 inhabitants of Mexico, who answered an online survey with measurements of social capital, uncertainty, and willingness to cooperate in the face of the pandemic. The relationships between variables were analyzed in two structural equation models, which show adequate goodness of fit, where higher levels of uncertainty generated by the pandemic were associated with a greater disposition to noncooperation with others, while social capital moderated this relation decreasing negative effects of uncertainty on noncooperation. The value of social capital is discussed as a resource worth preserving and promoting in communities to strengthen them, so that they are better able to face health or economic contingencies.","Cruz-Torres, Christian E; Martín Del Campo-Ríos, Jaime",Journal of community psychology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcop.22699; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34473355/,264

This review highlights the medical, social, and cultural factors of AUD in older adults and provides guidelines for its screening, evaluation, and management. RECENT FINDINGS: The COVID-19 pandemic has created additional challenges and barriers to care, as older adults may have disproportionate worsening of anxiety, depression, and substance use resulting from increased isolation related to physical distancing and shelter-in-place guidelines. SUMMARY: All older adults should be routinely screened for AUD with standardized screening tools. If a patient’s screening results are positive, a clinician should conduct a brief assessment, which may be supplemented by laboratory tests. Most older adults at risk for alcohol misuse do not need specialized SUD treatment, but most can benefit from Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) to prevent substance misuse before it occurs. Medications for the treatment of AUD in older adults include naltrexone, acamprosate, disulfiram, gabapentin and topiramate. Psychosocial treatments, including mutual help groups, are equally important.","Joshi, Pallavi; Duong, Karen T; Trevisan, Louis A.; Wilkins, Kirsten M.",Curr Geriatr Rep,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13670-021-00359-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34336549/,264

According to one estimate, 25% of the commonly used medicines contain compounds isolated from plants. Several plants could offer a rich reserve for drug discovery of infectious diseases, particularly in an era when the latest separation techniques are available on one hand, and the human population is challenged by a number of emerging infectious diseases on the other hand. Among several other ailments, viral infections, particularly infections associated with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and 2 (HIV-2), and newly emerging infectious viruses have challenged mankind survival. Of importance, a variety of medicinal plants have shown promise to treat a number of viral infections, and some of them possess broad-spectrum antiviral activity. In the past, exploration into the antiviral activity of various promising medicinal plants was limited due to: (a) highly infectious nature of viruses and (b) lack of appropriate separation techniques for the identification of antiviral components from plants. Development of vector-based strategies, in which non-infectious molecular clone of a virus could be used for antiviral screening purposes, and advancement in separation technologies offers promise for medicinal plants usage in modern drug discovery. This article describes potential antiviral properties of medicinal plants against a diverse group of viruses, and suggests screening the potential of plants possessing broad-spectrum antiviral effects against emerging viral infections.","Mukhtar, Muhammad; Arshad, Mohammad; Ahmad, Mahmood; Pomerantz, Roger J.; Wigdahl, Brian; Parveen, Zahida",Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17981353/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170207003383; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170207003383,264

First of all, there is no universally common ancestor of viruses. That is, viruses are polyphyletic and, so far, it has not been possible to construct a tree of viruses or to include them in the tree of life. Yet we classify and study viruses in the realm of biological sciences for a number of reasons. Viruses have exploited the nucleic acid and sequence space to their limits; they have also managed to create strategies of encoding information and expressing it in a unique manner that is foreign to cellular organisms; they vary in shape and form, infect only one host or a myriad of hosts, and some insert themselves into the genome of their host, changing its real-time performance or even its evolutionary history, sometimes benefiting the host or causing its death. In this chapter we briefly review the diversity in virus structure, genome organization, and features of virus replication in cells or organisms they infect; essentially we examine the ways viruses have become conspicuously present in our lives and how we seek to organize and make sense of their diversity.","Fermin, Gustavo",Viruses,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128112571000024; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128112571000024,264

Despite known and untold benefits, one issue has not been discussed: the right to refuse to be cited or the right to refuse a citation. Academics might not want to be cited by papers published in truly predatory journals, papers with false authors, or sting papers with falsified elements that employ underhanded ethical tactics. Currently, academics generally have the freedom to select where they publish their findings and choose studies they cite, so it is highly probable that requests to remove citations or refuse citations might never become formal publishing policy.

It was designated a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. COVID-19 has no effective treatment; nonetheless, early recognition of the disease and applying prevention strategies will help to mitigate the virus propagation. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and precautionary measures of medical center visitors at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted from July 15 to August 15, 2020. A consecutive sampling technique was used to select the study participants. Data were collected by using a pre-tested structured, self-administered questionnaire. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20. To explain the study variables, frequency tables, figures, and percentages were used. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regressions were used to see the association between independent and dependent variables. RESULTS: The prevalence of poor knowledge, attitude, and precautionary measures was 42.2%, 39%, and 41.6%, respectively. Being female (AOR=2.79, 95% CI=1.752–4.44), divorced (AOR=0.29, 95% CI=0.09–0.88), and residing in a rural location (AOR=1.93, 95% CI=1.07–3.26) were significantly associated with poor knowledge.

We employ 24-h daily average temperature, daily new confirmed cases of a covid-19 in Wuhan, and RMB exchange rate to represent the weather, covid-19 outbreak, and Chinese economy, respectively. The methodology of Wavelet Transform Coherence (WTC), Partial Wavelet Coherence (PWC), and Multiple Wavelet Coherence (MWC) is used to analyze the daily data collected from 21st January 2020 to 31st March 2020. Results reveal significant coherence between series at different time-frequency combinations. Overall results show the insignificance of an increase in temperature to contain new covid-19 infections. The Renminbi exchange rate showed a negative coherence at specific time-frequency spots suggesting a negative but limited impact of the covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan on the Chinese export economy. Our results are contrary to many earlier studies, which show a significant impact of increased temperature in slowing down covid-19 spread. These results can have important implications for economic and containment policy making regarding the covid-19 outbreak.","Iqbal, Najaf; Fareed, Zeeshan; Shahzad, Farrukh; He, Xin; Shahzad, Umer; Lina, Ma",Sci Total Environ,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720324335?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720324335; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138916; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388129/,264

The aim of this study is to investigate the health-related quality of life during quarantine in early adolescents. Data were collected from 1,289 adolescents (mean age, 12.5; male, 622), at the beginning of the school year (September 2019, Standard Condition, SC) as part of the AVATAR project and during Phase 1 of the Italian lockdown (mid-late April 2020) (COVID-19 Quarantine, CQ) using an online questionnaire. In the CQ period, with respect to SC, adolescents showed lower perception in the dimensions, such as psychological (p = 0.001), physical well-being (p = 0.001), mood/emotion (p = 0.008), autonomy (p = 0.001), and financial resources (p = 0.018). Relationship with the family (p = 0.021) and peers (p = 0.001), as well as the perception of bullying (p = 0.001) were reduced. In lifestyle, adolescents developed higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet (p = 0.001). Adolescents living in the village had greater reduction in both autonomy (p = 0.002) and peer relationships (p = 0.002). Moreover, the perception of physical well-being was lower in those living in the city instead of those living in the countryside (p = 0.03), in an apartment instead of a detached house (p = 0.002), and in those who did not have green space (p = 0.001). Gender effect emerged for the psychological (p = 0.007) and physical well-being (p = 0.001), mood/emotion (p = 0.001), and self-perception (p = 0.001).

To assess the evolution of transplanted patients up to 6 months following infection. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with confirmed influenza A infection from three Parisian transplant centers between September 1st, 2009 and February 15th, 2010. Clinical symptoms, biological, and radiological findings, and management were analysed and retrospectively compared between transplanted (T) and non-transplanted patients (NT). The evolution was assessed by a follow-up questionnaire, CT results 1 to 3 months after influenza infection and FEV1 variation. RESULTS: Seventy patients were included. Thirteen patients had an allograft (lung: eight, kidney: four, stem cells: one): (1) hospitalization: 100% (13 out of 13) in group T, 54% (31 out of 57) in group NT (P = 0.0013); (2) pneumonia: 62% (eight out of 13) in group T, 26% (eight out of 57) in group NT (P = 0.004); (3) mortality rate among hospitalized patients: 7.7% (one out of 13) in the group T, 9.7% (three out of 57) in group NT (P = NS); (4) chest CT scan abnormalities remained in four lung transplanted patients; (5) a minimum 10% decrease in FEV1 was detected in four lung transplant recipients. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that H1N1(2009) influenza A infection in transplant recipient patients compared to non-transplanted patients: (1) more often leads to hospitalization; (2) is more frequently associated with pneumonia; (3) is responsible for a persistent graft functional impairment in lung transplant recipients; (4) has a low mortality rate similar to admitted non-transplanted patients.","Crockett, F.; Mal, H.; Amazzough, K.; Stern, M.; Rivaud, E.; Cerf, C.; Matthieu, E.; Honderlick, P.; Scherrer, A.; Couderc, L.-J.",Rev Pneumol Clin,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0761841711000794; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0761841711000794,264

Nurses are recognized as front-line responders to the COVID-19 pandemic and are crucial healthcare members to win the fight against the evolving COVID-19. Considering the long-lasting shortage of national nurses, and turnover of the current nursing workforce, it is essential to consider unconventional strategies aiming at expanding the national nursing workforce in order to embrace the impact of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to measure senior nursing students and intern’s willingness to treat patients with COVID-19. Further, this study investigated their feelings, knowledge, and concerns regarding treating patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This quantitative, cross-sectional study utilized self-reported survey gathered from a convenience sample of 178 senior nursing students and interns. A 7-item scale was used to measure the participants’ willingness to treat patients with COVID-19. The data were collected between March 2020 and April 2020. RESULTS: Out of 178 participants, 50.56% were at Level 8, 89.33% were single, and 53.37% had a very satisfactory grade point average. The highest proportion of the respondents (38.20%) felt neutral about treating patient with COVID-19, while 53.93% had good knowledge about COVID-19. The perceived willingness to treat of participants had an overall mean score of 20.19, which indicated neutral willingness to treat patients with COVID-19. Participants’ feelings about treating patients with COVID-19 predicted their willingness to treat patients with COVID-19 (P<0.001). CONCLUSION/RECOMMENDATION: There is a clear need for educational and training programs both in clinical practice and academia for the improvement among nursing students and interns who reported paucity of knowledge about COVID-19. Furthermore, hospital institutions should provide additional incentives or hazard protections to maintain and even increase the number of staff at the frontline who are willing to care for patients amid the deadly pandemic of COVID-19.","Alshutwi, Sitah S",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,https://doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s279569; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33447108/,264

After prediction by using NCBI, WebMGA and GeneMark and comparison, a total of 8 credible ORFs were detected. Even the whole genome have great difference with other CoVs, each ORF has high homology with SARS-CoVs (>90%). Furthermore, domain composition in each ORFs was also similar to SARS. In the DrugBank database, only 7 potential drugs were screened based on the sequence search module. Further predicted binding sites between drug and ORFs revealed that 2-(N-Morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid could bind 1# ORF in 4 different regions ideally. Meanwhile, both benzyl (2-oxopropyl) carbamate and 4-(dimehylamina) benzoic acid have bene demonstrated to inhibit SARS-CoV infection effectively. Interestingly, 2 miRNAs (miR-1307-3p and miR-3613-5p) were predicted to prevent virus replication via targeting 3′-UTR of the genome or as biomarkers. In conclusion, the novel coronavirus may have consanguinity with SARS. Drugs used to treat SARS may also be effective against the novel virus. In addition, altering miRNA expression may become a potential therapeutic schedule.","Chen, Long; Zhong, Li",Genes Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32363223/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352304220300544; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gendis.2020.04.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352304220300544,264

641560,Severe exacerbation of immune thrombocytopenia and COVID-19: the favorable response to corticosteroid-based therapy—a case report,2020-06-04,"AIM: The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown on cardiac emergency admissions to hospitals has been reported previously. We aimed to study the emergency room (ER) admissions to cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) at a tertiary care center during that period and compare this with admissions during the same time frame in the previous years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study of patients admitted to the CICU during the pandemic period from March 22 to August 1 (inclusive) of 2020 and compared this with CICU admissions in the same time frame in the previous 2 years (2018 and 2019). RESULTS: During the study period in 2020, a total of 216 patients (age 59 ± 14 years) were admitted via ER, which is a 33% and 30% decline in admissions compared to 2019 (n = 322, age 63 ± 12 years) and 2018 (n = 307, age 62 ± 13), respectively. The decline in admissions with the primary diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), acute decompensated heart failure, arrhythmia, and other diagnoses during the study period in 2020 were 27%, 38%, 62%, and 59%, respectively, while there was a 50% increase in acute pulmonary embolism admission compared to the mean admission in 2018 and 2019. Weekly admission rates gradually increased from less than 10 per week in the first 3 weeks to >15 by eighth week of the study period in 2020, while the trend was same throughout the study period in the previous 2 years. The CICU mortality rate in 2020 study period was 4.6% compared to 3.9% in 2018 (p = 0.83) and 5.6% in 2019 (p = 0.70). The in-hospital mortality of these patients was also similar in all 3 years (6.5%, 7.8%, and 7.9% in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively; p = 0.61). CONCLUSION: Our study showed that CICU admissions during COVID-19 lockdown had declined compared to the previous years in a large tertiary center in India. Government and health organizations should educate the public early on during the pandemic about the consequences of ignoring other acute medical problems such as ACS, provide various measures for them to reach hospital early, and give reassurance with the best practices adopted in hospitals to avoid contracting the virus from the hospital environment.

COVID-19 infection exhibits signs that are shared with preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome, which may lead to needless interventions and iatrogenic preterm delivery. Objective: We evaluated the prevalence of HELLP-like signs in pregnant women admitted for COVID-19 and the value of angiogenic factors to rule out preeclampsia. Methods: a consecutive series of 27 pregnant women beyond 20 weeks of gestation, with symptomatic COVID-19. Clinical and analytical features were recorded and those cases with signs of HELLP syndrome were tested for sFlt-1/PlGF ratio. Results: Seven patients (25.9%) presented at least one sign of suspected HELLP syndrome, of which 2 (7.4%) were diagnosed clinically with PE because of hypertension and high transaminases and 5 (18.5%) had only elevated transaminases. sFlt-1/PlGF ratio was normal in 6 of 7. Conclusion: Symptomatic COVID-19 may simulate severe preeclampsia in pregnancy. Angiogenic factors may be essential to avoid false diagnosis and needless interventions.

641649,"Analyses of ABO blood groups with susceptibility and symptomatic variations of COVID‐19 infection, a questionnaire‐based survey",2021-08-16,"BACKGROUND: Many clinical trials investigating treatment efficacy require an interim analysis. Recently we have been running a large, multisite, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial investigating the effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment for improving or stabilizing the cognition of patients diagnosed with Alzheimer disease. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this paper are to report on recruitment, adherence, and adverse events (AEs) to date, and to describe in detail the protocol for interim analysis of the clinical trial data. The protocol will investigate whether the trial is likely to reach its objectives if continued to the planned maximum sample size. METHODS: The specific requirements of the analytic protocol are to (1) ensure the double-blind nature of the data while doing the analysis, (2) estimate the predictive probabilities of success (PPoSs), (3) estimate the numbers needed to treat, (4) re-estimate the initial required sample size. The initial estimate of sample size was 208. The interim analysis will be based on 150 patients who will be enrolled in the study and finish at least 8 weeks of the study. Our protocol for interim analysis, at the very first stage, is to determine the response rate for each participant to the treatment (either sham or active), while ensuring the double-blind nature of the data. The blinded data will be analyzed by a statistician to investigate the treatment efficacy. We will use Bayesian PPoS to predict the success rate and determine whether the study should continue. RESULTS: The enrollment has been slowed significantly due to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown. Nevertheless, so far 133 participants have been enrolled, while 22 of these have been withdrawn or dropped out for various reasons. In general, rTMS has been found tolerable with no serious AE. Only 2 patients dropped out of the study due to their intolerability to rTMS pulses. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the study with the same protocol is going as expected with no serious AE or any major protocol deviation.

Yet, the global character of the COVID-19 pandemic may blur boundaries between ingroups and outgroups and engage altruism at a broader level. In an online experiment, participants from the U.S. and Italy chose whether to allocate a monetary bonus to a charity active in COVID-19 relief efforts at the local, national, or international level. The purpose was to address two important questions about charitable giving in this context: first, what influences the propensity to give, and second, how is charitable giving distributed across different levels of collective welfare? We found that personal exposure to COVID-19 increased donations relative to those not exposed, even as levels of environmental exposure (numbers of cases locally) had no effect. With respect to targets of giving, we found that donors predominantly benefitted the local level; donations toward country and world levels were half as large. Social identity was found to influence charity choice in both countries, although an experimental manipulation of identity salience did not have any direct effect.","Grimalda, Gianluca; Buchan, Nancy R.; Ozturk, Orgul D.; Pinate, Adriana C.; Urso, Giulia; Brewer, Marilynn B.",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-97234-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34556687/,264

BACKGROUND: Tracheostomy is often performed for prolonged endotracheal intubation in critically ill patients. However, in the context of COVID-19, tracheostomy placement pathways have been altered due to the poor prognosis of intubated patients and the risk of transmission to providers through this highly aerosolizing procedure. METHODS: A prospective single-system multi-center observational cohort study was performed on patients who underwent tracheostomy after acute respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the 53 patients who underwent tracheostomy, the average time from endotracheal intubation to tracheostomy was 19.7 days ± 6.9 days. The most common indication for tracheostomy was acute respiratory distress syndrome, followed by failure to wean ventilation and post-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation decannulation. Thirty patients (56.6%) were liberated from the ventilator, 16 (30.2%) have been discharged alive, 7 (13.2%) have been decannulated, and 6 (11.3%) died. The average time from tracheostomy to ventilator liberation was 11.8 days ± 6.9 days (range 2–32 days). Both open surgical and percutaneous dilational tracheostomy techniques were performed utilizing methods to mitigate aerosols. No healthcare worker transmissions resulted from performing the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations to tracheostomy practices and processes were successfully instituted. Following these steps, tracheostomy in COVID-19 intubated patients seems safe for both patients and healthcare workers performing the procedure.","Chao, Tiffany N.; Harbison, Sean P.; Braslow, Benjamin M.; Hutchinson, Christoph T.; Rajasekaran, Karthik; Go, Beatrice C.; Paul, Ellen A.; Lambe, Leah D.; Kearney, James J.; Chalian, Ara A.; Cereda, Maurizio F.; Martin, Niels D.; Haas, Andrew R.; Atkins, Joshua H.; Rassekh, Christopher H.",Ann Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32541213/; https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000004166,264

As of March 2021, there were more than 120 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 2.7 million deaths. The COVID-19 mortality rate in adults is around 1–5%, and only a small proportion of children requires hospitalization and intensive care. Recently, an increasing number of COVID-19 cases in children have been associated with a new multisystem inflammatory syndrome. Its clinical features and laboratory characteristics are similar to those of Kawasaki disease (KD), KD shock syndrome, and toxic shock syndrome. However, this new disorder has some distinct clinical features and laboratory characteristics. This condition, also known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19, has been observed mostly in Europe and the United States. This emerging phenomenon has raised the question of whether this disorder is KD triggered by SARS-CoV-2 or a syndrome characterized by multisystem inflammation that mimics KD. This narrative review is to discuss the differences between MIS-C and KD with the aim of increasing pediatricians' awareness of this new condition and guide them in the process of differential diagnosis.","Lee, Min-Sheng; Liu, Yi-Ching; Tsai, Ching-Chung; Hsu, Jong-Hau; Wu, Jiunn-Ren",Front Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34222140/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2021.640118,264

Cybermanufacturing will unleash the potential of multi-modal manufacturing data, and provide a new perspective called computation service, as a part of service-oriented architecture (SOA), where on-demand computation requests throughout manufacturing operations are seamlessly satisfied by data analytics and machine learning. However, the complexity of information technology infrastructure leads to fundamental challenges in modeling and analysis under cybermanufacturing, ranging from information-poor datasets to a lack of reproducibility of analytical studies. Nevertheless, existing reviews have focused on the overall architecture of cybermanufacturing/SOA or its technical components (e.g., communication protocol), rather than the potential bottleneck of computation service with respect to modeling and analysis. In this paper, we review the fundamental challenges with respect to modeling and analysis in cybermanufacturing. Then, we introduce the existing efforts in computation pipeline recommendation, which aims at identifying an optimal sequence of method options for data analytics/machine learning without time-consuming trial-and-error. We envision computation pipeline recommendation as a promising research field to address the fundamental challenges in cybermanufacturing. We also expect that computation pipeline recommendation can be a driving force to flexible and resilient manufacturing operations in the post-COVID-19 industry.","Kang, SungKu; Jin, Ran; Deng, Xinwei; Kenett, Ron S.",J Intell Manuf,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10845-021-01817-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34376924/,264

Since 2020, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been a new factor that has been, additionally, hindering studies. Therefore, the aim of our study is to compare demographic, socio-economic, health-related characteristics and the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection occurrence among the randomly selected group and the group composed of volunteers. We compare two groups of participants from the cross-sectional study assessing the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which was conducted in autumn 2020, in three cities of the Silesian Voivodeship in Poland. The first group consisted of a randomly selected, nationally representative, age-stratified sample of subjects (1167 participants, “RG” group) and was recruited using personal invitation letters and postal addresses obtained from a national registry. The second group (4321 volunteers, “VG” group) included those who expressed their willingness to participate in response to an advertisement published in the media. Compared with RG subjects, volunteers were more often females, younger and professionally active, more often had a history of contact with a COVID-19 patient, post-contact nasopharyngeal swab, fewer comorbidities, as well as declared the occurrence of symptoms that might suggest infection with SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, in the VG group the percentage of positive IgG results and tuberculosis vaccination were higher. The findings of the study confirm that surveys limited to volunteers are biased. The presence of the bias may seriously affect and distort inference and make the generalizability of the results more than questionable. Although effective control over selection bias in surveys, including volunteers, is virtually impossible, its impact on the survey results is impossible to predict. However, whenever possible, such surveys could include a small component of a random sample to assess the presence and potential effects of selection bias.","Gajda, Maksymilian; Kowalska, Małgorzata; Zejda, Jan Eugeniusz",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189928; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34574850/,264

However, research involving secondary data analyses does not present immediately obvious ways to involve patients and the public. Innovative approaches to ensure their involvement is meaningful and effective are required. The Cancer Survival Group cohosted a full-day meeting with the National Cancer Research Institute Consumer Forum—a group of patients and carers. This included the Forum’s ‘Dragons’ Den’: a small-group session in which their members provided insight, advice and ideas on current or planned research in the Cancer Survival Group. We investigated this activity as an example of effective patient involvement, with the aim of developing broad recommendations to improve epidemiological/quantitative research by involving patients and carers as directly as possible. In addition to quantitative data captured through evaluation forms completed after the event, we used semistructured interviews of a sample of participants to evaluate the effectiveness of the session and to learn lessons. The interviews were analysed to identify broad or recurrent themes and recommendations. Feedback was overwhelmingly positive, and some impacts on the research projects were identified. Interviewees commented on overall expectations and experiences, as well as specifics of room layout, timing of the session, composition of groups, effectiveness of the facilitation and content of discussions. We present a summary of our findings as a guide for other researchers, including recommendations for improvement gleaned from the interviews. The value to researchers of hosting and participating in such activities was clear. We developed recommendations that should help to improve future events for ourselves and for others who wish to conduct similar activities, which in turn may lead to more concrete benefits for research and patients.","Morris, Melanie; Alencar, Yuki; Rachet, Bernard; Stephens, Richard; Coleman, Michel P",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-036311; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32998916/,264
647918,Real-time assessment of COVID-19 prevalence among multiple sclerosis patients: a multicenter European study,2020-07-02,"[Image: see text] Insomnia is an anabatic epidemiology, while the mechanism is extremely complicated; it remains one of the major scientific challenges in life sciences. Because of the advantage of having a similar genetic background and circadian rhythm as those of humans, the Drosophila melanogaster model organism is hugely popular in sleep-related drug screening studies. Seven-day-old virgin D. melanogaster was used to establish the sleep deprivation model by repeated light stimulation at night. Using PySolo activity monitoring system and Drosophila activity as indices, the effective fractions of Zhi-Zi-Hou-Po decoction (ZZHPD) for insomnia were screened; the content of monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine (DA), 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA), Homovanillic acid (HVA), and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the brain of D. melanogaster were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-electro-chemical detection. The herb-compound-target-disease target network were further constructed through network pharmacology to identify the potential targets and pathways of ZZHPD in the intervention of insomnia. Finally, the molecular docking method was used for evaluating the binding characteristics of important compounds from ZZHPD with related targets. The results showed that a certain dose of ZZHPD and its petroleum ether, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol fractions could improve sleep. The dichloromethane fraction from ZZHPD extracts showed the best anti-insomnia effect among all extracts. It can also reduce the content of DA and HVA in the brain of D. melanogaster and increase 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels. The network pharmacology showed that the main active ingredients in ZZHPD included magnolol, honokiol, hesperidin, and so forth. According to the screening conditions, there were 71 targets and the result of KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that 73 pathways were associated with insomnia, which were primarily involved in inflammatory response, central neurotransmitter regulation, and apoptosis to relieve insomnia. The molecular docking results clarified that naringenin and apigenin have an intimate relationship with GABA(A) receptor, histamine H1, orexin receptor type 2, and interleukin-6. The mechanism of relieving insomnia is the result of the interaction of multi-components, multi-targets, and multi-pathways, which provides a certain theoretical basis for the treatment of insomnia and related diseases as well as clinical research.","Sun, Yu; Zhao, Renyun; Liu, Runhua; Li, Tianyi; Ni, Shiting; Wu, Hao; Cao, Yijia; Qu, Yuxia; Yang, Tiange; Zhang, Chenning; Sun, Yikun",ACS Omega,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33842786/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.1c00445,264

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data pertaining to patient demographics, medical history, blood parameters, periodontal clinical examination and aMMP-8 point-of-care diagnostics (both site-level and patient-level) was recorded for eighty-two COVID-19-positive patients. COVID-19-related outcomes such as COVID-19 pneumonia, death/survival, types of hospital admission and need of assisted ventilation were also assessed. RESULTS: Males were predominantly afflicted with COVID-19, with advanced age exhibiting a greater association with the presence of periodontitis. Higher severity of periodontitis led to 7.45 odds of requiring assisted ventilation, 36.52 odds of hospital admission, 14.58 odds of being deceased and 4.42 odds of COVID-19-related pneumonia. The aMMP-8 mouthrinse kit was slightly more sensitive but less specific than aMMP-8 site-specific tests. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings of the present study, periodontitis seems to be related to poorer COVID-19-related outcomes. However, within the constraints of this work, a direct causality may not be established. Periodontitis, by means of skewing the systemic condition for a number of comorbidities, may eventually influence COVID-19 outcomes in an indirect manner. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The study is the first to clinically, and by means of a validated point-of-care diagnostic methodology, assess the association between periodontal health and COVID-19-related outcomes. Assessment of the periodontal status of individuals can aid in the identification of risk groups during the pandemic along with reinforcing the need to maintain oral hygiene and seeking periodontal care.","Gupta, Shipra; Mohindra, Ritin; Singla, Mohita; Khera, Sagar; Sahni, Vaibhav; Kanta, Poonam; Soni, Roop Kishor; Kumar, Amit; Gauba, Krishan; Goyal, Kapil; Singh, Mini P.; Ghosh, Arnab; Kajal, Kamal; Mahajan, Varun; Bhalla, Ashish; Sorsa, Timo; Räisänen, Ismo",Clin Oral Investig,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34448073/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00784-021-04111-3,264
649865,Potential association of COVID-19 and ABO blood group: An Indian study,2021-06-01,"Objectives: Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, people with underlying comorbidities were overrepresented in hospitalised cases of COVID-19, but the relationship between comorbidity and COVID-19 outcomes was complicated by potential confounding by age. This review therefore sought to characterise the international evidence base available in the early stages of the pandemic on the association between comorbidities and progression to severe disease, critical care, or death, after accounting for age, among hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a rapid, comprehensive review of the literature (to 14 May 2020), to assess the international evidence on the age-adjusted association between comorbidities and severe COVID-19 progression or death, among hospitalised COVID-19 patients – the only population for whom studies were available at that time. Results: After screening 1,100 studies, we identified 14 eligible for inclusion. Overall, evidence for obesity and cancer increasing risk of severe disease or death was most consistent. Most studies found that having at least one of obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart disease, cancer, or chronic lung disease was significantly associated with worse outcomes following hospitalisation. Associations were more consistent for mortality than other outcomes. Increasing numbers of comorbidities and obesity both showed a dose-response relationship. Quality and reporting were suboptimal in these rapidly conducted studies, and there was a clear need for additional studies using population-based samples. Conclusions: This review summarises the most robust evidence on this topic that was available in the first few months of the pandemic. It was clear at this early stage that COVID-19 would go on to exacerbate existing health inequalities unless actions were taken to reduce pre-existing vulnerabilities and target control measures to protect groups with chronic health conditions.","Mason, Kate E.; Maudsley, Gillian; McHale, Philip; Pennington, Andy; Day, Jennifer; Barr, Ben",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.584182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34422736/,264
650630,Digital endpoints for self‐administered home‐based functional assessment in pediatric Friedreich’s ataxia,2021-08-06,"Venous thromboembolism is the third common cardiovascular disease and is composed of two entities, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and its potential fatal form, pulmonary embolism (PE). While PE is observed in ~ 40% of patients with documented DVT, there is limited biomarkers that can help identifying patients at high PE risk. To fill this need, we implemented a two hidden-layers artificial neural networks (ANN) on 376 antibodies and 19 biological traits measured in the plasma of 1388 DVT patients, with or without PE, of the MARTHA study. We used the LIME algorithm to obtain a linear approximate of the resulting ANN prediction model. As MARTHA patients were typed for genotyping DNA arrays, a genome wide association study (GWAS) was conducted on the LIME estimate. Detected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested for association with PE risk in MARTHA. Main findings were replicated in the EOVT study composed of 143 PE patients and 196 DVT only patients. The derived ANN model for PE achieved an accuracy of 0.89 and 0.79 in our training and testing sets, respectively. A GWAS on the LIME approximate identified a strong statistical association peak (rs1424597: p = 5.3 × 10(–7)) at the PLXNA4 locus. Homozygote carriers for the rs1424597-A allele were then more frequently observed in PE than in DVT patients from the MARTHA (2% vs. 0.4%, p = 0.005) and the EOVT (3% vs. 0%, p = 0.013) studies. In a sample of 112 COVID-19 patients known to have endotheliopathy leading to acute lung injury and an increased risk of PE, decreased PLXNA4 levels were associated (p = 0.025) with worsened respiratory function. Using an original integrated proteomics and genetics strategy, we identified PLXNA4 as a new susceptibility gene for PE whose exact role now needs to be further elucidated.","Razzaq, Misbah; Iglesias, Maria Jesus; Ibrahim-Kosta, Manal; Goumidi, Louisa; Soukarieh, Omar; Proust, Carole; Roux, Maguelonne; Suchon, Pierre; Boland, Anne; Daiain, Delphine; Olaso, Robert; Havervall, Sebastian; Thalin, Charlotte; Butler, Lynn; Deleuze, Jean-François; Odeberg, Jacob; Morange, Pierre-Emmanuel; Trégouët, David-Alexandre",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-93390-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34234248/,264
650871,COVID-19 and Stroke: An Emerging Association,2021-03-18,"The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is a double challenge for people infected with comorbidities such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes. Comorbidities have been reported to be risk factors for the complications of COVID-19. In this work, we develop and analyze a mathematical model for the dynamics of COVID-19 infection in order to assess the impacts of prior comorbidity on COVID-19 complications and COVID-19 re-infection. The model is simulated using data relevant to the dynamics of the diseases in Lagos, Nigeria, making predictions for the attainment of peak periods in the presence or absence of comorbidity. The model is shown to undergo the phenomenon of backward bifurcation caused by the parameter accounting for increased susceptibility to COVID-19 infection by comorbid susceptibles as well as the rate of re-infection by those who have recovered from a previous COVID-19 infection. Sensitivity analysis of the model when the population of individuals co-infected with COVID-19 and comorbidity is used as response function revealed that the top ranked parameters that drive the dynamics of the co-infection model are the effective contact rate for COVID-19 transmission, $betasst{cv}$, the parameter accounting for increased susceptibility to COVID-19 by comorbid susceptibles, $chisst{cm}$, the comorbidity development rate, $thetasst{cm}$, the detection rate for singly infected and co-infected individuals, $eta_1$ and $eta_2$, as well as the recovery rate from COVID-19 for co-infected individuals, $varphisst{i2}$. Simulations of the model reveal that the cumulative confirmed cases (without comorbidity) may get up to 180,000 after 200 days, if the hyper susceptibility rate of comorbid susceptibles is as high as 1.2 per day. Also, the cumulative confirmed cases (including those co-infected with comorbidity) may be as high as 1000,000 cases by the end of November, 2020 if the re-infection rates for COVID-19 is 0.1 per day. It may be worse than this if the re-infection rates increase higher. Moreover, if policies are strictly put in place to step down the probability of COVID-19 infection by comorbid susceptibles to as low as 0.4 per day and step up the detection rate for singly infected individuals to 0.7 per day, then the reproduction number can be brought very low below one, and COVID-19 infection eliminated from the population. In addition, optimal control and cost-effectiveness analysis of the model reveal that the the strategy that prevents COVID-19 infection by comorbid susceptibles has the least ICER and is the most cost-effective of all the control strategies for the prevention of COVID-19.","Omame, D.

651057,MA07.08 Needs Assessment of Lung Cancer Patients & Caregivers in the Post-Shelter-in-Place Era in the United States during COVID-19,2021-03-31,"The Covid-19 pandemic has intensified the debate among optimists, pessimists, and centrists about whether the world economic order is undergoing a fundamental change. While optimists foresee the continuation of economic globalization after the pandemic, pessimists expect localization instead of globalization, given the pandemic’s structural negative consequence on the world economy. By contrast, the centrists anticipate a “U-shaped” recovery, where Covid-19 will not kill globalization but slow it down. The three existing perspectives on Covid-19’s impact on the economic globalization are not without merit, but they do not take sufficient temporal distance from the ongoing issue. This article suggests employing the historical perspective to expand the time frame by examining the rise and fall of economic globalization before and after the 2008 global financial crisis. The authors argue that economic globalization has been in transition since the 2008 financial crisis, and one important but not exclusive factor to explain this change is the evolving US–China economic relationship, from symbiotic towards increasingly competitive. The economic restructuring in US and China has begun after both countries weathered the 2008 crisis and gained momentum since the outbreak of trade war and Covid-19. The article investigates this trend by distinguishing different types of production activities, and the empirical results confirm that localization and regionalization have been filling the vacuum of economic globalization in retreat in the last decade.","Wang, Zhaohui; Sun, Zhiqiang",J Chin Polit Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33144822/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11366-020-09706-3,264

Scientists and pharmaceutical companies have been in race to produce vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Vaccine generation usually demands years of developing and testing for efficacy and safety. However, it only took less than one year to generate two mRNA vaccines from their development to deployment. The rapid production time, cost-effectiveness, versatility in vaccine design, and clinically proven ability to induce cellular and humoral immune response have crowned mRNA vaccines with spotlights as most promising vaccine candidates in the fight against the pandemic. In this review, we discuss the general principles of mRNA vaccine design and working mechanisms of the vaccines, and provide an up-to-date summary of pre-clinical and clinical trials on seven anti-COVID-19 mRNA candidate vaccines, with the focus on the two mRNA vaccines already licensed for vaccination. In addition, we highlight the key strategies in designing mRNA vaccines to maximize the expression of immunogens and avoid intrinsic innate immune response. We also provide some perspective for future vaccine development against COVID-19 and other pathogens.","Park, Jung Woo; Lagniton, Philip N.P.; Liu, Yu; Xu, Ren-He",Int J Biol Sci,https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.59233; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33907508/,264

We performed a systematic review in order to investigate a possible association between body weight and prognosis among patients diagnosed with COVID-19. We searched in Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, WHO-Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease, OpenGrey, and Medrxiv. We used the ROBINS-I tool or Cross-Sectional/Prevalence Study Quality tool from AHRQ, to evaluate the methodological quality of included studies. Nine studies (two prospective cohorts, four retrospective cohorts and three cross-sectional) were included and assessed the relationship between obesity and COVID-19 prognosis. Risk of bias of the included studies ranged from moderate to critical. Clinical and methodological heterogeneity among them precluded meta-analyses. Most of the included studies showed some degree of association to: (a) higher BMI and worse clinical presentation and (b) obesity and need of hospitalization. The results were inconsistent about the impact of obesity on mortality. Based on limited methodological quality studies, obesity seems to predict poor clinical evolution in patients with COVID-19. Further studies with appropriate prospective design are needed to reduce the uncertainty on this evidence.","Peres, Karina Colombera; Riera, Rachel; Martimbianco, Ana Luiza Cabrera; Ward, Laura Sterian; Cunha, Lucas Leite",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2020.00562; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32922366/,264

This disease is usually found to occur in individuals aged between 6 and 12 months, with a clinical phenotype resembling that of Hurler syndrome and radiological findings resembling those of dysostosis multiplex. However, we encountered a rare case of an infant with ML II who presented with prenatal skeletal dysplasia and typical clinical features of severe secondary hyperparathyroidism at birth. A female infant was born at 37(+1) weeks of gestation with a birth weight of 1,690 g (<3rd percentile). Prenatal ultrasonographic findings revealed intrauterine growth retardation and skeletal dysplasia. At birth, the patient had characteristic features of ML II, and skeletal radiographs revealed dysostosis multiplex, similar to rickets. In addition, the patient had high levels of alkaline phosphatase and parathyroid hormone, consistent with severe secondary neonatal hyperparathyroidism. The activities of β-D-hexosaminidase and α-N-acetylglucosaminidase were moderately decreased in the leukocytes but were 5- to 10-fold higher in the plasma. Examination of a placental biopsy specimen showed foamy vacuolar changes in trophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts. The diagnosis of ML II was confirmed via GNPTAB genetic testing, which revealed compound heterozygosity of c.3091C>T (p.Arg1031X) and c.3456_3459dupCAAC (p.Ile1154GlnfsX3), the latter being a novel mutation.

There is the need to provide an update for each single medical discipline, including neurosurgery, to be used by single professionals or to be distributed through the neurosurgical community and to be used by governments in designing new scenario of care. Methods A review of the MEDLINE database was performed on April 13th, 2020. Search terms included “COVID-19”, “neurosurgery,” and “surgery”. A review of documents published on the web-page of the WFNS and of the 5 continental associations of neurosurgical societies AANS, AASNS, CAANS, EANS, and FLANC representing the 119 national Neurosurgical Societies around the world was performed. Results The literature search yielded 38 results that were manually reviewed. Fourteen manuscripts were considered eligible. They described suggestions and considerations to optimize care of neurosurgical patients, editorials on operational models, perspectives from neurosurgical departments, letters to the editor describing experiences on how to help medical staff to be prepared in advance for pandemic situations, description of regional or departmental models and/or organizational schemes. The webpages of the searched societies reported a total of 57 documents. Conclusions The neurosurgical scientific community has promptly reacted to the COVID-19 outbreak by producing a growing number of documents that could serve as guidance for neurosurgeons all over the world. Neurosurgical Societies will represent the key-institutions for guiding the neurosurgical community to overcome the COVID-19 crisis.","Germanò, Antonino; Raffa, Giovanni; Angileri, Filippo Flavio; Cardali, Salvatore Massimiliano; Tomasello, Francesco",World Neurosurg,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878875020308913?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878875020308913; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360733/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.04.181,264
653500,AN UNUSUAL CASE OF ACUTE MAJOR ISCHEMIC STROKE IN AN ANTICOAGULATED COVID-19 PATIENT WITH DEVASTATING OUTCOME,2020-10-31,"Serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 can be used for evaluation of past infection in individual patients and for community seroprevalence studies. We evaluated the analytical and clinical performance of the Genalyte Maverick SARS-CoV-2 Multi-Antigen Serology Panel compared to the Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (NC) qualitative immunoassay, using well characterized clinical serum samples. A total of 143 pre-pandemic sera and 48 sera collected from patients with a negative molecular SARS-CoV-2 result were used for specificity studies. For sensitivity analyses, 179 sera were used, obtained 3-7 days, 8-14 days, or ≥ 15 days after symptom onset from patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Specificity was determined to be 95.3% (182/191) for the Genalyte Maverick. Overall sensitivity of the Genalyte Maverick was similar to that observed for the Roche Elecsys NC test, 79.3% (142/179) vs. 76.5% (137/179), respectively. Genalyte Maverick trended, without statistical significance, towards higher sensitivity as compared to the Roche Elecsys NC test in the 3-7 days (11/25 vs. 9/25, respectively) and 8-14 days (21/28 vs. 19/28, respectively) post-symptom onset sample sets, but was identical in the ≥ 15 days post-symptom onset group (106/116 vs. 106/116, respectively). Therefore, the Genalyte Maverick serologic test had similar overall sensitivity to the Roche Elecsys NC assay, but may have slightly improved sensitivity for early seroconversion. The lower Genalyte Maverick specificity as compared to the Roche Elecsys NC assay as reported by other studies (>99%), may necessitate confirmatory testing of positive Genalyte Maverick results if implemented for clinical use.","Donato, Leslie J.; Theel, Elitza S.; Baumann, Nikola A.; Bridgeman, Amber R.; Blommel, Joseph H.; Wu, Yanhong; Karon, Brad S.",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2667038021000223; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667038021000223?v=s5,264
653529,"When cardiomyopathy, cancer, and COVID‐19 collide: A case report",2021-02-01,"Background: Limited data on the efficacy and safety of currently applied COVID-19 therapeutics and their impact on COVID-19 outcomes have raised additional concern. Objective and Methods: To estimate the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 therapeutics, we performed meta-analyses of the studies reporting clinical features and treatments of COVID-19 published from January 21 to September 6, 2020. Results: We included 136 studies that involved 102,345 COVID-19 patients. The most prevalent treatments were antibiotics (proportion: 0.59, 95% CI: [0.51, 0.67]) and antivirals (proportion: 0.52, 95% CI: [0.44, 0.60]). The combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and Arbidol was the most effective in treating COVID-19 (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.68, 95% CI: [0.15, 1.21]). The use of corticosteroids was associated with a small clinical improvement (SMD = −0.40, 95% CI: [−0.85, −0.23]), but with a higher risk of disease progression and death (mortality: RR = 9.26, 95% CI: [4.81, 17.80]; hospitalization length: RR = 1.54, 95% CI: [1.39, 1.72]; severe adverse events: RR = 2.65, 95% CI: [2.09, 3.37]). The use of hydroxychloroquine was associated with a higher risk of death (RR = 1.68, 95% CI: [1.18, 2.38]). The combination of lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, and interferon-β (RR = 0.34, 95% CI: [0.22, 0.54]); hydroxychloroquine (RR = 0.58, 95% CI: [0.39, 0.58]); and lopinavir/ritonavir (RR = 0.72, 95% CI: [0.56, 0.91]) was associated with reduced hospitalization length. Hydrocortisone (RR = 0.05, 95% CI: [0.03, 0.10]) and remdesivir (RR = 0.74, 95% CI: [0.62, 0.90]) were associated with lower incidence of severe adverse events. Dexamethasone was not significant in reducing disease progression (RR = 0.45, 95% CI: [0.16, 1.25]) and mortality (RR = 0.90, 95% CI: [0.70, 1.16]). The estimated combination of corticosteroids with antivirals was associated with a better clinical improvement than antivirals alone (SMD = −1.09, 95% CI: [−1.64, −0.53]). Conclusion: Antivirals are safe and effective in COVID-19 treatment. Remdesivir cannot significantly reduce COVID-19 mortality and hospitalization length, while it is associated with a lower incidence of severe adverse events. Corticosteroids could increase COVID-19 severity, but it could be beneficial when combined with antivirals.

656446,Responsive neurostimulation for focal motor status epilepticus,2021-05-06,"An unprecedented upsurge of COVID-19-positive cases and deaths is currently being witnessed across India. According to WHO, India reported an average of 3.9 lakhs of new cases during the first week of May 2021 which equals 47% of new cases reported globally and 276 daily cases per million population. In this letter, the concept of SIR and fractal interpolation models is applied to predict the number of positive cases in India by approximating the epidemic curve, where the epidemic curve denotes the two-dimensional graphical representation of COVID-19-positive cases in which the abscissa denotes the time, while the ordinate provides the number of positive cases. In order to estimate the epidemic curve, the fractal interpolation method is implemented on the prescribed data set. In particular, the vertical scaling factors of the fractal function are selected from the SIR model. The proposed fractal and SIR model can also be explored for the assessment and modeling of other epidemics to predict the transmission rate. This letter investigates the duration of the second and third waves in India, since the positive cases and death cases of COVID-19 in India have been highly increasing for the past few weeks, and India is in a midst of a catastrophizing second wave. The nation is recording more than 120 million cases of COVID-19, but pandemics are still concentrated in most states. In order to predict the forthcoming trend of the outbreaks, this study implements the SIR and fractal models on daily positive cases of COVID-19 in India and its provinces, namely Delhi, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Maharashtra.","Kavitha, C.; Gowrisankar, A.; Banerjee, Santo",Eur Phys J Plus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34094795/; https://doi.org/10.1140/epjp/s13360-021-01586-7,264

To avoid potential undesired side effects of this data analysis method, such as privacy violations, considerable research has been conducted over the last decade to develop participatory sensing that looks to preserve privacy while analyzing participants’ surrounding information. To protect privacy, each participant perturbs the sensed data in his or her device, then the perturbed data is reported to the data collector. The data collector estimates the true data distribution from the reported data. As long as the data contains no sensing errors, current methods can accurately evaluate the data distribution. However, there has so far been little analysis of data that contains sensing errors. A more precise analysis that maintains privacy levels can only be achieved when a variety of sensing errors are considered.","Sei, Yuichi; Ohsuga, Akihiko",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s20102785; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32422958/,264

659642,Author response to Letter to the Editor ‘Liver impairment associated with disease progression in COVID‐19 patients’,2020-05-13,"Blood transfusions come with risks and high costs, and should be utilized only when clinically indicated. Decisions to transfuse are however not always well informed, and lack of clinician knowledge and education on good clinical transfusion practices contribute to the inappropriate use of blood. Low and middle-income countries in particular take much strain in their efforts to address blood safety challenges, demand-supply imbalances, high blood costs as well as high disease burdens, all of which impact blood usage and blood collections. Patient blood management (PBM), which is a patient-focused approach aimed at improving patient outcomes by preemptively diagnosing and correcting anaemia and limiting blood loss by cell salvage, coagulation optimization and other measures, has become a major approach to addressing many of the challenges mentioned. The associated decrease in the use of blood and blood products may be perceived as being in competition with blood conservation measures, which is the more traditional, but primarily product-focused approach. In this article, we hope to convey the message that PBM and blood conservation should not be seen as competing concepts, but rather complimentary strategies with the common goal of improving patient care. This offers opportunity to improve the culture of transfusion practices with relief to blood establishments and clinical services, not only in South Africa and LMICs, but everywhere. With the COVID-19 pandemic impacting blood supplies worldwide, this is an ideal time to call for educational interventions and awareness as an active strategy to improve transfusion practices, immediately and beyond.","Rambiritch, Vanitha; Verburgh, Estelle; Louw, Vernon Johan",Transfusion and apheresis science : official journal of the World Apheresis Association : official journal of the European Society for Haemapheresis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34353706/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transci.2021.103207,264

Serology, which detects the host antibody response to the infection, is the most appropriate tool for this task, since virus-derived markers are most reliably detected during the acute phase of infection. Here we show that our ELISA protocol, which is based on antibody binding to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of the viral Spike protein expressed as a novel fusion protein, detects antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. We also show that our ELISA is accurate and versatile. It compares favorably with commercial assays widely used in clinical practice to determine exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, our protocol accommodates use of various blood- and non-blood-derived biospecimens, such as breast milk, as well as dried blood obtained with microsampling cartridges that are appropriate for remote collection. As a result, our RBD-based ELISA protocols are well suited for seroepidemiology and other large-scale studies requiring parsimonious sample collection outside of healthcare settings.","Datta, Pratik; Ukey, Rahul; Bruiners, Natalie; Honnen, William; Carayannopoulos, Mary O.; Reichman, Charles; Choudhary, Alok; Onyuka, Alberta; Handler, Deborah; Guerrini, Valentina; Mishra, Pankaj K.; Dewald, Hannah K.; Lardizabal, Alfred; Lederer, Leeba; Leiser, Aliza L.; Hussain, Sabiha; Jagpal, Sugeet K.; Radbel, Jared; Bhowmick, Tanaya; Horton, Daniel B.; Barrett, Emily S.; Xie, Yingda L.; Fitzgerald-Bocarsly, Patricia; Weiss, Stanley H.; Woortman, Melissa; Parmar, Heta; Roy, Jason; Dominguez-Bello, Maria Gloria; Blaser, Martin J.; Carson, Jeffrey L.; Panettieri, Reynold A.; Libutti, Steven K.; Raymond, Henry F.; Pinter, Abraham; Gennaro, Maria Laura",J Immunol Methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2021.113165; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022175921002106; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022175921002106?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34634317/,264

DESIGN Retrospective, observational cohort study. METHODS Adult patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 who underwent ophthalmic examination from April to July 2020 were reviewed. Retinopathy was defined as one of the following: 1) Retinal hemorrhage; 2) Cotton wool spots; 3) Retinal vascular occlusion. We analyzed medical comorbidities, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores, clinical outcomes, and laboratory values for their association with retinopathy. RESULTS Thirty-seven patients with severe COVID-19 were reviewed, the majority of whom were female (n = 23, 62%), Black (n = 26, 69%), and admitted to the intensive care unit (n = 35, 95%). Fourteen patients had retinopathy (38%) with retinal hemorrhage in 7 (19%), cotton wool spots in 8 (22%), and a branch retinal artery occlusion in 1 (3%) patient. Patients with retinopathy had higher SOFA scores than those without retinopathy (8.0 vs. 5.3, p = .03), higher rates of respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and shock requiring vasopressors (p < .01). Peak D-dimer levels were 28,971 ng/mL in patients with retinopathy compared to 12,575 ng/mL in those without retinopathy (p = .03). Peak CRP was higher in patients with cotton wool spots versus those without cotton wool spots (354 mg/dL vs. 268 mg/dL, p = .03). Multivariate logistic regression modeling showed an increased risk of retinopathy with higher peak D-dimers (aOR 1.32, 95% CI 1.01-1.73, p = .04) and male sex (aOR 9.6, 95% CI 1.2-75.5, p = .04). CONCLUSION Retinopathy in severe COVID-19 was associated with greater systemic disease morbidity involving multiple organs. Given its association with coagulopathy and inflammation, retinopathy may offer insight into disease pathogenesis in patients with severe COVID-19.","Shantha, Jessica G; Auld, Sara C; Anthony, Casey; Ward, Laura; Adelman, Max W; Maier, Cheryl L; Price, Kenneth W; Jacob, Jesse; Fashina, Tolulope; Randleman, Casey; Xu, Lucy T; Barnett, Joshua; Sadan, Ofer; Kandiah, Prem A; Varkey, Jay B; Kraft, Colleen S; Rouphael, Nadine; Linderman, Susanne; Ahmed, Rafi; Drews-Botsch, Carolyn; Waggoner, Jesse J; Weinmann, Max; Murphy, David J; Yeh, Steven",Ocular immunology and inflammation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34464544/; https://doi.org/10.1080/09273948.2021.1952278,264

The global best practices have firstly been recorded among the ICT companies which offered teleworking to their employees, empowering safety and flexibility through remote work policies and flexible working hours. Although hybrid working models might become a standard in many industries, only a paucity of papers has examined the relationship between novel working environments and various classes of intangible assets. The aim of this paper is to present the effects of hybrid working models (telework and flexible working hours) on intangible assets (human, relational, structural and intellectual capital). While the existing hybrid work principles have already shown mixed effects on corporate outcomes, its impact on intangible assets remains unrevealed. To address this research gap, we conducted an empirical study. Primary data were collected in the Serbian ICT sector (N=122) using a structured questionnaire developed for this purpose. Data was analyzed with the OLS regression. The results confirm the positive effects of the hybrid working model on intangible assets of ICT companies, which could further propel the financial success of these companies. In general, these results imply that hybrid working models, which are becoming a standard for many industries, would not jeopardize the creation of intangible assets – the ultimate resource of modern companies © 2021, Amfiteatru Economic.

The lack of an effective treatment and the emergence of varied and complicated clinical courses in certain populations have rendered treatment of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 difficult. METHODS: Tokyo Metropolitan Tama Medical Center, a public tertiary acute care center located in Tokyo, the epicenter of COVID-19 in Japan, has been admitting patients with COVID-19 since February 2020. The present, retrospective, case-series study aimed to investigate the clinical course and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at the study institution. RESULTS: In total, 101 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to our hospital to receive inpatient care. Eleven patients (10.9%) received ECMO, and nine patients (8.9%) died during hospitalization after COVID-19 was diagnosed. A history of smoking and obesity were most commonly encountered among patients with a complicated clinical course. Most patients who died requested to be transferred to advanced palliative care in the early course of their hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience of caring for these patients demonstrated a relatively lower mortality rate and higher survival rate in those with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation placement than previous reports from other countries and underscored the importance of proactive, advanced care planning in the early course of hospitalization.","Yao, Kenta; Hasegawa, Shinya; Tagashira, Yasuaki; Takamatsu, Akane; Uenoyama, Yuki; Shimizu, Keiki; Honda, Hitoshi",J Infect Chemother,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1341321X20304311; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1341321X20304311; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiac.2020.11.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33342681/,264

Our previous studies have shown that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV spike (S) protein elicits highly potent neutralizing antibody responses in the immunized animals. But it is unknown whether RBD can also induce protective immunity in an animal model, a key aspect for vaccine development. In this study, BALB/c mice were vaccinated intramuscularly (i.m.) with 10 μg of RBD-Fc (RBD fused with human IgG1 Fc) and boosted twice at 3-week intervals and one more time at 12th month. Humoral immune responses of vaccinated mice were investigated for up to 12 months at a 1-month interval and the neutralizing titers of produced antibodies were reported at months 0, 3, 6 and 12 post-vaccination. Mice were challenged with the homologous strain of SARS-CoV 5 days after the last boost, and sacrificed 5 days after the challenge. Mouse lung tissues were collected for detection of viral load, virus replication and histopathological effects. Our results showed that RBD-Fc vaccination induced high titer of S-specific antibodies with long-term and potent SARS-CoV neutralizing activity. Four of five vaccinated mice were protected from subsequent SARS-CoV challenge because no significant virus replication, and no obvious histopathological changes were found in the lung tissues of the vaccinated mice challenged with SARS-CoV. Only one vaccinated mouse had mild alveolar damage in the lung tissues. In contrast, high copies of SARS-CoV RNA and virus replication were detected, and pathological changes were observed in the lung tissues of the control mice. In conclusion, our findings suggest that RBD, which can induce protective antibodies to SARS-CoV, may be further developed as a safe and effective SARS subunit vaccine.","Du, Lanying; Zhao, Guangyu; He, Yuxian; Guo, Yan; Zheng, Bo-Jian; Jiang, Shibo; Zhou, Yusen",Vaccine,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X06011534; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17092615/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X06011534,264

METHODS: Analytical cross-sectional study recruited 1046 HCWs by cluster random sampling technique. Socio-demographic, health, and occupational characteristics were collected for all participants. The WHO five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) and General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) were used to assess MW and SE of the participants, respectively. The binary logistic regression model was fit to the dependent (outcomes), namely mental well-being and self-efficacy, and independent other variables (predictors). RESULTS: Out of all participants (n=1046), 27.2% had negative MW scores, and 36.6% had low SE scores. The mean scores of both MW and SE were in the normal levels (16.7±5.90 and 31.5±6.63 out of 25 and 40, respectively). Younger and older ages, irregular exercise, nursing professions, history of anxiety and/or depression, lesser years of experience, and longer daily working hours were found to be the main predictors of negative MW and low SE, among study participants.

More than 1500 cases of MERS have been reported in human beings to date. Although MERS has been associated with 30% case fatality in human beings, MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in dromedaries is usually asymptomatic. In rare cases, dromedaries may develop mild respiratory signs. No MERS-CoV or antibodies against the virus have been detected in camelids other than dromedaries. MERS-CoV is mainly acquired in dromedaries when they are less than 1 year of age, and the proportion of seropositivity increases with age to a seroprevalence of 100% in adult dromedaries. Laboratory diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection in dromedaries can be achieved through virus isolation using Vero cells, RNA detection by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR and antigen detection using respiratory specimens or serum. Rapid nucleocapsid antigen detection using a lateral flow platform allows efficient screening of dromedaries carrying MERS-CoV. In addition to MERS-CoV, which is a lineage C virus in the Betacoronavirus (betaCoV) genus, a lineage B betaCoV and a virus in the Alphacoronavirus (alphaCoV) genus have been detected in dromedaries.

We aimed to investigate temporal trends in COVID-19 outcomes in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases over the course of the pandemic. METHODS: Using a large, multicentre, electronic health record network (TriNetX), we did a comparative cohort study of patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases who were diagnosed with COVID-19 (by International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision code or positive PCR test) during the first 90 days of the pandemic (early cohort) compared with the second 90 days of the pandemic (late cohort), matched (1:1) for demographics, comorbidities, laboratory results, glucocorticoid use, and previous hospitalisations using an exposure score method. Outcomes were assessed within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis, including hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, renal failure, and death. We did a subgroup analysis among patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases who were hospitalised with COVID-19. FINDINGS: We identified 8540 patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases who were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the 6-month study period, including 2811 in the early cohort and 5729 in the late cohort. In the exposure score matched analysis, the risk of hospitalisation was lower in the late cohort than in the early cohort (874 [32·4%] of 2701 patients vs 1227 [45·4%] of 2701 patients; relative risk [RR] 0·71, 95% CI 0·67–0·76).

However, statins may increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry by inducing ACE2 expression. Here, we performed a retrospective study on 13,981 patients with COVID-19 in Hubei Province, China, among which 1,219 received statins. Based on a Cox model with time-varying exposure, as well as a mixed-effect Cox model after propensity score-matching, we found that the risk for 28-day all-cause mortality was 5.2% and 9.4% in the matched statin and non-statin groups, respectively, with a hazard ratio 0.58. These results imply the potential benefits of statin therapy in hospitalized subjects with COVID-19. Further, they give support for the completion of on-going prospective studies and randomized controlled trials involving statin treatment for COVID-19, which are needed to further validate the utility of this class of drugs to combat the mortality of this pandemic.","Zhang, Xiao-Jing; Qin, Juan-Juan; Cheng, Xu; Shen, Lijun; Zhao, Yan-Ci; Yuan, Yufeng; Lei, Fang; Chen, Ming-Ming; Yang, Huilin; Bai, Liangjie; Song, Xiaohui; Lin, Lijin; Xia, Meng; Zhou, Feng; Zhou, Jianghua; She, Zhi-Gang; Zhu, Lihua; Ma, Xinliang; Xu, Qingbo; Ye, Ping; Chen, Guohua; Liu, Liming; Mao, Weiming; Yan, Youqin; Xiao, Bing; Lu, Zhigang; Peng, Gang; Liu, Minyu; Yang, Jun; Yang, Luyu; Zhang, Changjiang; Lu, Haofeng; Xia, Xigang; Wang, Daihong; Liao, Xiaofeng; Wei, Xiang; Zhang, Bing-Hong; Zhang, Xin; Yang, Juan; Zhao, Guang-Nian; Zhang, Peng; Liu, Peter P.; Rohit, Loomba; Ji, Yan-Xiao; Xia, Jiahong; Wang, Yibin; Cai, Jingjing; Guo, Jiao; Li, Hongliang",Cell Metab,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32592657/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413120303168?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2020.06.015; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1550413120303168,264
668247,Efficacy of Neoadjuvant Single or Dual Anti-HER-2 Therapy Combined with Chemotherapy in Patients with HER-2-Positive Breast Cancer: A Single-Center Retrospective Study,2021-05-11,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) may be the inadvertent interface between the healthcare setting and the community for infectious diseases transmission. AIM: To investigate HCWs' contacts during a work day and compare these against working adults from the general population. METHODS: Prospective survey of contacts through 24 h self-reported diary in three public sector tertiary care hospitals and community-based working adults in Singapore. Participants were HCWs and working adults from the community. FINDINGS: In all, 211 HCWs and 1028 working adults reported a total of 4066 and 9206 contacts. HCWs reported more work-related contacts than community-based working adults (median of 13 versus 4), and more contacts that were neither household nor work-related (1 versus 0) but fewer household contacts (2 versus 3). HCWs reported more work-related contacts involving physical contacts, and more new contacts particularly with short duration (≤15 min) compared to community-based working adults. Among different HCW types, doctors reported the highest whereas ward-based nurses reported the lowest total work-related contacts. Around half of ward-based and clinic-based nurses' contacts involved physical touch. Work-related contacts reported by clinic-based nurses, doctors, and assorted HCWs were shorter than in ward-based nurses, with a substantial number effectively occurring with new contacts. Institutional effects significant on univariate analyses were much reduced and non-significant after adjusting for confounding by HCW type. CONCLUSION: HCWs' contacts differ substantially from those of community-based working adults. HCWs may thus be at higher risk of acquiring and spreading contact-transmissible and respiratory infections due to the nature of their work. Whereas total number of contacts was fairly similar between HCW types, the characteristics of their contacts differed substantively.","Jiang, Lili; Ng, Isabel Hui Leng; Hou, Yan'an; Li, Dunli; Tan, Linda Wei Lin; Ho, Hanley Jian An; Chen, Mark I-Cheng",J Hosp Infect,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2017.10.020; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S019567011730587X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29097147/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019567011730587X,264
668321,Sensitivity and specificity of chest computed tomography scan based on RT-PCR in COVID-19 diagnosis,2021-01-27,"It is increasingly recognized that a key component of successful infection control efforts is understanding the complex, two-way interaction between disease dynamics and human behavioral and social dynamics. Human behavior such as contact precautions and social distancing clearly influence disease prevalence, but disease prevalence can in turn alter human behavior, forming a coupled, nonlinear system. Moreover, in many cases, the spatial structure of the population cannot be ignored, such that social and behavioral processes and/or transmission of infection must be represented with complex networks. Research on studying coupled disease–behavior dynamics in complex networks in particular is growing rapidly, and frequently makes use of analysis methods and concepts from statistical physics. Here, we review some of the growing literature in this area. We contrast network-based approaches to homogeneous-mixing approaches, point out how their predictions differ, and describe the rich and often surprising behavior of disease–behavior dynamics on complex networks, and compare them to processes in statistical physics. We discuss how these models can capture the dynamics that characterize many real-world scenarios, thereby suggesting ways that policy makers can better design effective prevention strategies. We also describe the growing sources of digital data that are facilitating research in this area. Finally, we suggest pitfalls which might be faced by researchers in the field, and we suggest several ways in which the field could move forward in the coming years.","Wang, Zhen; Andrews, Michael A.; Wu, Zhi-Xi; Wang, Lin; Bauch, Chris T.",Phys Life Rev,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1571064515001372; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.plrev.2015.07.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26211717/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1571064515001372,264

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients who had undergone elective thoracic surgery from 12 February 2020 to 30 April 2020 and were symptomatic or tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection within 14 days after surgery, with a focus on their complications and potential deaths. RESULTS: Out of 101 surgical procedures, including 57 primary oncological resections, 6 lung transplants and 18 emergency procedures, only 5 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 were identified, 3 in the immediate postoperative period and 2 as outpatients. All 5 patients had cancer; the median age was 64 years. The main virus-related symptom was fever (80%), and the median onset of coronavirus disease 2019 was 3 days. Although 80% of the patients who had positive test results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 required in-hospital care, none of them were considered severe or critical and none died. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that, in properly selected cases, with short preoperative in-hospital stays, strict isolation and infection control protocols, managed by a dedicated multidisciplinary team, a surgical procedure could be performed with a relatively low risk for the patient.","Hoyos Mejía, Lucas; Romero Román, Alejandra; Gil Barturen, Mariana; Córdoba Pelaez, Maria del Mar; Campo-Cañaveral de la Cruz, José Luis; Naranjo, José Manuel; Crolwey Carrasco, Silvana; Tanaka, Shin; Sánchez Calle, Alvaro; Varela de Ugarte, Andrés; Gómez de Antonio, David",Eur J Cardiothorac Surg,https://doi.org/10.1093/ejcts/ezaa324; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084869/,264

Perception of two alternative health care priorities was also investigated. One priority was improving treatment compliance of patients with hypertension and diabetes. The other priority was strengthening the healthcare system for continuous care. Our study design to evaluate community-based intervention programs for hypertension and diabetes was developed using brainstorming, Delphi techniques, and content analysis along with literature review. We finally proposed a hierarchical structure of the AHP model with 50 third sub-criteria in six levels. By surveying this AHP questionnaire to a total of 185 community health practitioners in Korea, we found that improving treatment compliance of patients with chronic diseases should be relatively more important than strengthening the healthcare system. Further research is needed to expand survey subjects to primary care physicians and even policymakers of central government for the appropriate application of this AHP model.","Byun, Do Hwa; Chang, Rho Soon; Park, Myung-Bae; Son, Hyo-Rim; Kim, Chun-Bae",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33430108/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18020455,264

669978,SARS-CoV2 infection as a potential trigger for severe relapse in a patient with multiple sclerosis who stopped disease modifying treatment due to COVID-19 pandemic,2021-07-17,"Two surveys of opinions about wildlife conservation were carried out in Hunan Province, China, before and after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic. Hunan is the northern neighbor of Guangdong Province, where the first SARS case was reported. The custom of consuming wild meat was not common in Hunan 30 years ago. However, in recent years, consumption of wildlife such as snakes has spread to northern China. We handed out 1300 questionnaires between 22 February and 10 May 2002, before the SARS epidemic. Survey sites included the provincial capital, major cities, towns, and villages in Hunan. Another 1300 questionnaires were distributed between 10 March and 10 May 2004, after the SARS epidemic. The 2004 survey covered the same sites as the 2002 survey. Questionnaire recovery rates for the 2002 and 2004 surveys were 81.2% and 84.6%, respectively. The valid return rate was 73.0%. Frog, snake, hare, and pheasant were the wild meats most frequently eaten by local people. At the time of the first survey, more than 80% of interviewees claimed to have eaten frogs. That number had reduced to 60% by the time of the second survey. Monkey, Chinese pangolin, and bear paw were the wild meats least frequently eaten. Although palm civet was suspected to be the carrier of SARS, it was interesting to note that, after the SARS epidemic, the proportion of people surveyed who ate palm civets had declined only slightly. The results of the surveys indicate a low level of conservation consciousness; however, after the SARS and bird flu epidemics, there were obvious changes in the conservation consciousness of people in Hunan Province. We recommend some measures that could be taken to change the habits of people who consume wildlife.","YANG, Daode; DAI, Xiaofeng; DENG, Yiping; LU, Weiquan; JIANG, Zhigang",Integr Zool,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21396016/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-4877.2007.00043.x,264

Earlier studies suggested that air pollutants and meteorological factors were considered as the risk factors for acute respiratory infection, which carries harmful pathogens and affects the immunity. The study intended to explore the correlation between air pollutants, meteorological factors, and the daily reported infected cases caused by novel coronavirus in India. The daily positive infected cases, concentrations of air pollutants, and meteorological factors in 288 districts were collected from January 30, 2020, to April 23, 2020, in India. Spearman’s correlation and generalized additive model (GAM) were applied to investigate the correlations of four air pollutants (PM(2.5), PM(10), NO(2), and SO(2)) and eight meteorological factors (Temp, DTR, RH, AH, AP, RF, WS, and WD) with COVID-19-infected cases. The study indicated that a 10 μg/m(3) increase during (Lag0-14) in PM(2.5), PM(10), and NO(2) resulted in 2.21% (95%CI: 1.13 to 3.29), 2.67% (95% CI: 0.33 to 5.01), and 4.56 (95% CI: 2.22 to 6.90) increase in daily counts of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID 19)-infected cases respectively. However, only 1 unit increase in meteorological factor levels in case of daily mean temperature and DTR during (Lag0-14) associated with 3.78% (95%CI: 1.81 to 5.75) and 1.82% (95% CI: -1.74 to 5.38) rise of COVID-19-infected cases respectively. In addition, SO(2) and relative humidity were negatively associated with COVID-19-infected cases at Lag0-14 with decrease of 7.23% (95% CI: -10.99 to -3.47) and 1.11% (95% CI: -3.45 to 1.23) for SO(2) and for relative humidity respectively. The study recommended that there are significant correlations between air pollutants and meteorological factors with COVID-19-infected cases, which substantially explain the effect of national lockdown and suggested positive implications for control and prevention of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 disease.

670927,COVID-19 and liver transplantation: the jury is still out,2020-10-30,"In this paper, a highly sensitive graphene-based multiple-layer (BK(7)/Au/PtSe(2)/Graphene) coated surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor is proposed for the rapid detection of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). The proposed sensor was modeled on the basis of the total internal reflection (TIR) technique for real-time detection of ligand-analyte immobilization in the sensing region. The refractive index (RI) of the sensing region is changed due to the interaction of different concentrations of the ligand-analyte, thus impacting surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) excitation of the multi-layer sensor interface. The performance of the proposed sensor was numerically investigated by using the transfer matrix method (TMM) and the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The proposed SPR biosensor provides fast and accurate early-stage diagnosis of the COVID-19 virus, which is crucial in limiting the spread of the pandemic. In addition, the performance of the proposed sensor was investigated numerically with different ligand-analytes: (i) the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as ligand and the COVID-19 virus spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) as analyte, (ii) the virus spike RBD as ligand and the virus anti-spike protein (IgM, IgG) as analyte and (iii) the specific probe as ligand and the COVID-19 virus single-standard ribonucleic acid (RNA) as analyte. After the investigation, the sensitivity of the proposed sensor was found to provide 183.33°/refractive index unit (RIU) in SPR angle (θ(SPR)) and 833.33THz/RIU in SPR frequency (SPRF) for detection of the COVID-19 virus spike RBD; the sensitivity obtained 153.85°/RIU in SPR angle and 726.50THz/RIU in SPRF for detection of the anti-spike protein, and finally, the sensitivity obtained 140.35°/RIU in SPR angle and 500THz/RIU in SPRF for detection of viral RNA. It was observed that whole virus spike RBD detection sensitivity is higher than that of the other two detection processes. Highly sensitive two-dimensional (2D) materials were used to achieve significant enhancement in the Goos-Hänchen (GH) shift detection sensitivity and plasmonic properties of the conventional SPR sensor. The proposed sensor successfully senses the COVID-19 virus and offers additional (1 + 0.55) × L times sensitivity owing to the added graphene layers. Besides, the performance of the proposed sensor was analyzed based on detection accuracy (DA), the figure of merit (FOM), signal-noise ratio (SNR), and quality factor (QF). Based on its performance analysis, it is expected that the proposed sensor may reduce lengthy procedures, false positive results, and clinical costs, compared to traditional sensors. The performance of the proposed sensor model was checked using the TMM algorithm and validated by the FDTD technique.","Akib, Tarik Bin Abdul; Mou, Samia Ferdous; Rahman, Md. Motiur; Rana, Md.

The COVID-19 pandemic provides a unique opportunity. Based on daily data of air quality, we used TVP-VAR model and utilize the pandemic as a quasi-experiment to assess the policies. The results show air pollution in surrounding cities does influence Beijing's air quality, but the relationship has been weakening year by year, mainly due to industrial adjustment which have achieved progress on alleviating the path of air pollution. Therefore, it is necessary to implement joint regulation in areas with serious pollution. Specifically, the relationship between the air quality of Beijing and Zhangjiakou, Chengde, Tianjin decreased as the pandemic became worse. In contrast, there was no significant decline in Langfang and Baoding. So unlike Baoding and Langfang, industrial production increased relationships between air quality of Beijing and the other three cities, which highlights the validity of restrictions. However, restrictions implemented on Baoding and Langfang affect economic development but have little effect on Beijing's air governance.

We revisit the phenomenon of asymptomatic patients despite very low pulse oximetry readings, the so-called “sweet hypoxia” or “happy hypoxia” or “silent hypoxemia”. We describe for the first time, the sequential chest radiographic images of the progressive radiological trajectory of COVID-19 pneumonia. METHOD: Case Report. RESULTS: A 62-year old hypertensive obese Caucasian male, an ex-smoker, was diagnosed with mild community-acquired pneumonia in mid-March 2020, following evaluation for low grade fever. He had traveled to Florida and Texas in the previous month. He tested positive for COVID-19 by RT-PCR. A week later, he was admitted to a Community Hospital with one day history of new shortness of breath and loose stools. Vital signs were stable. Pulse oximeter was 96% on room air. He was fatigued with few bibasilar lung crackles. CBC was normal. Creatinine was 1.0 mg/dL. Abnormal laboratory: sodium 131 mmol/L, AST 50 iu/L, ALT 96 iu/L. Chest radiograph revealed new patchy left lower lobe airspace infiltrate (Figure 1B). EKG showed regular sinus rhythm of 96/min, QT interval 445 msec and PVCs. Treatment included nasal cannula oxygen, IV fluids, IV Azithromycin and IV Ceftriaxone. He improved the next day, requested discharge home, vital signs were stable, pulse oximetry was 91% on room air, sodium had normalized at 137 mmol/L and he was discharged home on Azithromycin 500 mg daily x 3 days and Cefdinir 300 mg BID x 5 days. He cheerfully went home. Later that night he quickly developed worsening dyspnea. He was readmitted about 18 hours post-discharge. Temperature 99.40F, blood pressure 161/101, pulse 100/min. He was tachypneic and pulse oximetry was 82% on room air. This improved to 93% on 4.5 LPM nasal cannula oxygen. Initial EKG was normal. New pertinent laboratory data: Bicarbonate 17 mmol/L, phosphorus 5.5 mg/dL, calcium 7.2 mg/dL, creatinine 1.1 mg/dL, BNP 31 pg/mL and lactic acid 1.2 mmol/L. PTT was 28.3 sec. HIV-1 p24 AG, HIV-1 AB, HIV-2 AB, HbSAG and Hepatitis C AB were negative. Chest radiograph showed worsening bilateral infiltrates (Figure 1C). He very quickly desaturated in the ED down to 81% despite high flow oxygen therapy. He was promptly intubated (Figure 2A). Oxygenation immediately improved. He was transferred to the ICU on IV Vancomycin and IV Cefepime. He developed septic shock and required IV Norepinephrine. With worsening chest radiographs, (Figures 2B & 2C), he was transferred to a tertiary medical center. On transfer, pertinent new data: creatinine 1.38 mg/dL, albumin 2.8 g/dL, Ferritin 2,573 ng/mL, LDH 534 u/L, CRP 6.0 mg/L, INR 1.2, D-Dimer 1.04, procalcitonin 0.38 ng/mL, WBC 13.3 x 109/L. EKG showed sinus bradycardia. Urine Legionnaire AG and Strep. Pneumonia AG were negative. IV Azithromycin 500 mg daily and IV Ceftriaxone 2 gm daily were administered for 8 days. Chloroquine phosphate 500 mg 2x daily was added. IV Norepinephrine was continued. IV fluids were withheld. The head of the bed was elevated to >30(0). DVT prophylaxis with SQ Enoxaparin and Vitamin C were administered. New blood cultures remained negative. COVID-19 RT-PCR after 3 days remained positive. He was extubated after 4 days and discharged home after 9 days with normalized creatinine of 1.03 mg/dL. CONCLUSION: We have for the first time demonstrated the sequential chest radiographic images of the progressive radiological trajectory of COVID-19 pneumonia. The place of non-invasive ventilation demands further study. The so-called “sweet hypoxia” or “happy hypoxia” or “silent hypoxemia” in COVID-19 is revisited – indeed, it is not exactly limited to COVID-19 patients. The need to mitigate lung barotrauma is mandatory. Finally, prognostication of pneumonia in COVID-19 is unpredictable. Too early premature discharge from the hospital is strongly discouraged.","Onuigbo, Macaulay; Olabode, Kolade; Sengodan, Mohan",Nephrol Dial Transplant,https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfab092.0048,264

Furthermore, older people with reduced renal function might be at higher risk for developing functional limitation and disability. Moreover, the current creatinine-based measures of renal function are influenced by several factors in older population. The aims of the CKD-3D project are to perform an observational study to expand the knowledge about CKD-disability relationship and to investigate the use of novel biomarkers of kidney function. METHODS: An observational, multicenter, prospective cohort study will be conducted in 75 + old patients consecutively admitted to acute care wards of geriatric medicine at participating hospitals. The study planned to enroll 440 patients undergoing clinical and laboratory evaluations at baseline and after 12 months. Face-to-face follow-up at 6 months and telephone follow-up at 3 and 9 months will be carried out. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) and the measurement of Cystatin C, Beta-Trace Protein and Beta2-Microglobulin levels will be included. DISCUSSION: This study will provide useful information to prevent CKD-related disability by collecting real-life data over 1-year period. The combined approach of CGA and the investigation of innovative existing biomarkers will make it possible to develop new recommendations and guidelines for a patient-centered approach. It is believed that such a study may lead to an improvement of knowledge on CKD in elderly patients and may also have implications in daily clinical practice and in decision-making process.","Corsonello, Andrea; Mattace-Raso, Francesco; Tap, Lisanne; Maggio, Marcello; Zerbinati, Luna; Guarasci, Francesco; Cozza, Annalisa; D’Alia, Sonia; Soraci, Luca; Corigliano, Valentina; Di Rosa, Mirko; Fabbietti, Paolo; Lattanzio, Fabrizia",Aging Clin Exp Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33389685/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40520-020-01755-1,264

There is increasing evidence to suggest that the hypoxic environment may activate innate immune cells and suppress adaptive immunity, further stimulating inflammation and inhibiting immunosurveillance. We found that dysfunctional immune regulation may aggravate hypoxia-induced tissue damage and contribute to secondary injury. Among the diverse mechanisms of hypoxia-induced immune dysfunction identified to date, the role of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) has recently attracted much attention. Besides leading to tumour immune evasion, PD-L1 has also been found to participate in the progression of the immune dysfunction which mediates hypoxia-induced multiple organ injury. In this review, we aimed to summarise the role of immune dysfunction in hypoxia-induced multiple organ injury, the effects of hypoxia on the cellular expression of PD-L1, and the effects of upregulated PD-L1 expression on immune regulation.

673445,The Brief Case: “Not Positive” or “Not Sure”—COVID-19-Negative Results in a Symptomatic Patient,2020-07-23,"The potential health risks associated with (re-)emerging positive-strand RNA (+RNA) viruses emphasizes the need for understanding host-pathogen interactions for these viruses. The innate immune system forms the first line of defense against pathogenic organisms like these and is responsible for detecting pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Viral RNA is a potent inducer of antiviral innate immune signaling, provoking an antiviral state by directing expression of interferons (IFNs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, +RNA viruses developed various methods to avoid detection and downstream signaling, including isolation of viral RNA replication in membranous viral replication organelles (ROs). These structures therefore play a central role in infection, and consequently, loss of RO integrity might simultaneously result in impaired viral replication and enhanced antiviral signaling. This review summarizes the first indications that the innate immune system indeed has tools to disrupt viral ROs and other non- or aberrant-self membrane structures, and may do this by marking these membranes with proteins such as microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) and ubiquitin, resulting in the recruitment of IFN-inducible GTPases. Further studies should evaluate whether this process forms a general effector mechanism in +RNA virus infection, thereby creating the opportunity for development of novel antiviral therapies.","Scutigliani, Enzo Maxim; Kikkert, Marjolein",Cytokine Growth Factor Rev,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1359610117300667; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28709747/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359610117300667; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cytogfr.2017.05.007,264

The mean reduction in exacerbation rate of 34 patients who received IFN-B (recipients) was significantly greater during the study than that of 35 patients who received placebo (p <0.04). The prestudy exacerbation rates were comparable in recipients and controls, but the rate at the end of the study was significantly lower in recipients than in controls (p <0.001). IFN-B was given by nine or ten lumbar punctures over the first 6 months of the study, and patient observations continued for 2 years. IFN-B was well tolerated in 95% of the recipients, and the side-effects experienced were clearly acceptable for the benefits achieved. Low doses of indomethacin reduced the toxicity of IFN-B and played an important role in successful double-blinding.","Jacobs, Lawrence; Herndon, Robert; Freeman, Arnold; Cuetter, Albert; Smith, WilliamA.; Salazar, AndresM.; Reese, PeterA.; Josefowicz, Ralph; Husain, Farhat; Ekes, Roslyn; O'Malley, JudithA.",The Lancet,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673686927303; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2878272/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673686927303,264
675313,Cilastatin: a potential treatment strategy against COVID-19 that may decrease viral replication and protect from the cytokine storm,2020-09-24,"BACKGROUND: Left ventricular thrombus (LVT) is a complication of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) due to localised haemostasis. LVT is typically seen 3-12 days following AMI and is seldom seen within the first 24 hours. LVT increases the risk of mortality due to systemic thromboembolism. Patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) are potentially hypercoagulable and this may promote early development of LVT. CASE: A 50-year-old man with no past medical history was admitted with a severe diabetic ketoacidosis following a 4-day history of cough and fever. The patient tested positive for COVID-19 and required intensive care treatment for ventilation and haemofiltration. After returning to ward-based care, the patient developed chest pain and electrocadiographic changes consistent with an acute anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Emergency percutaneous coronary intervention was performed to the left anterior descending artery. However, the patient developed diuretic-resistant pulmonary oedema and a bedside echocardiogram revealed significant LVT despite only 4 hours of chest pain. The thrombus was associated with the anteroseptal wall of the left ventricle which was hypokinetic but not aneurysmal. An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was inserted, but the patient developed ipsilateral lower limb ischaemia due to the formation of thrombus in the femoral artery and irreversible cardiogenic shock from which he ultimately succumbed. CONCLUSION: COVID-19-positive patients are potentially hypercoagulable, and MI in this population may precipitate LVT earlier than expected. Consideration should be made for routine early screening of post-MI COVID-19 patients for LVT. If detected, anticoagulation may reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality in this high-risk group.","Sharma, Harish; George, Sudhakar",Case Rep Cardiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32733710/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8882463,264

These visits constitute a key part of Australian GP training. Despite being mandatory and resource-intensive, there is a paucity of evidence regarding the content and educational utility of CTVs. This study aims to establish the content and educational utility of CTVs across varying practice settings within Australia, as perceived by registrars and their assessors (‘CT visitors’). In addition, this study aims to establish registrar, CT visitor and practice factors associated with CTV content and perceived CTV utility ratings. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will collect data prospectively using online questionnaires completed soon after incident CTVs. Participants will be registrars and CT visitors of CTVs conducted from March 2020 to January 2021. The setting is three Regional Training Organisations across four Australian states and territories (encompassing 37% of Australian GP registrars). Outcome factors will be a number of specified CTV content elements occurring during the CTV as well as participants’ perceptions of CTV utility, which will be analysed using univariate and multivariable regression. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval has been granted by the University of Newcastle Human Research Ethics Committee, approval number H-2020-0037.

Albania, a small country with a geographical, historical and cultural relationship with Italy was one of the first countries giving support and starting a profitable collaboration focusing on the mission to provide the necessary help for the health care workers. In order to help the Italian healthcare system to face up to the situation two medical teams firstly (in March) and a group of 60 health care workers later in April were sent to Italy (Brescia Hospital) to support clinical activities in departments with COVID-19 patients.

677216,The COVID-19 immune landscape is dynamically and reversibly correlated with disease severity,2020-11-02,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a rapid implementation of telemedicine for the provision of maternal and newborn healthcare. The objective of this study was to document the experiences with providing telemedicine for maternal and newborn healthcare during the pandemic among healthcare professionals globally. METHODS: The second round of a global online survey of maternal and newborn health professionals was conducted, disseminated in 11 languages. Data were collected between 5 July and 10 September 2020. The questionnaire included questions regarding background, preparedness and response to COVID-19, and experiences with providing telemedicine. Descriptive statistics and qualitative thematic analysis were used to analyse responses, disaggregated by country income level. RESULTS: Responses from 1060 maternal and newborn health professionals were analysed. Telemedicine was used by 58% of health professionals and two-fifths of them reported not receiving guidelines on the provision of telemedicine. Key telemedicine practices included online birth preparedness classes, antenatal and postnatal care by video/phone, a COVID-19 helpline and online psychosocial counselling. Challenges reported lack of infrastructure and technological literacy, limited monitoring, financial and language barriers, lack of non-verbal feedback and bonding, and distrust from patients. Telemedicine was considered as an important alternative to in-person consultations. However, health providers emphasised the lower quality of care and risk of increasing the already existing inequalities in access to healthcare. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine has been applied globally to address disruptions of care provision during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, some crucial aspects of maternal and newborn healthcare seem difficult to deliver by telemedicine. More research regarding the effectiveness, efficacy and quality of telemedicine for maternal healthcare in different contexts is needed before considering long-term adaptations in provision of care away from face-to-face interactions. Clear guidelines for care provision and approaches to minimising socioeconomic and technological inequalities in access to care are urgently needed.","Galle, Anna; Semaan, Aline; Huysmans, Elise; Audet, Constance; Asefa, Anteneh; Delvaux, Therese; Afolabi, Bosede Bukola; El Ayadi, Alison Marie; Benova, Lenka",BMJ Glob Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33632772/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-004575,264

While a majority of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection shows asymptomatic or mild disease, hospitalized patients can develop critical condition, such as pneumonia, sepsis, and respiratory failure. Some cases deteriorate into sever systemic disease and multiorgan failure. Many patients of severe COVID-19 show hypercoagulable state and complicate with venous thromboembolism and atrial thrombosis. We herein reported a case of COVID-19 who developed cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) co-incidence with pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE). A 56-year-old Japanese man was presented with fever and malaise and diagnosed with COVID-19. He was treated with ciclesonide and azithromycin, but his respiratory condition deteriorated. Thus, systemic corticosteroids and favipiravir were initiated and these treatments resulted in afebrile state, improving malaise and respiratory failure. However, he suddenly developed severe headache and vomiting with increased concentration of D-dimer. Brain CT and MRI showed typical images of CVT in the left transvers sinus and CT pulmonary angiography showed PE. Administration of unfractionated heparin followed by edoxaban treatment reduced the levels of D-dimer and improved his clinical presentation and thrombosis. Monitoring coagulopathy is important in COVID-19 patients and in case of venous thromboembolism, including cerebral venous system, appropriate anticoagulant therapy should be initiated.","Sugiyama, Yohsuke; Tsuchiya, Takaaki; Tanaka, Ryota; Ouchi, Aiko; Motoyama, Arata; Takamoto, Takeshi; Hara, Natsumi; Yanagawa, Yoshitaka",J Clin Neurosci,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967586820314004?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33070913/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocn.2020.07.038; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0967586820314004,264

Little is known about how they perceive this isolation and its subsequent impact on their relationships with peers, both during and after isolation for treatment. This study describes the experience of hospital isolation from the perspectives of children and adolescents with a malignant brain tumor. The use and impact of information and communication technologies (ICT) as a possible bridge for contact is also explored. Following a qualitative approach utilizing interpretive phenomenological analysis, in-depth interviews were conducted with eight youth participants who had undergone treatment for medulloblastoma. Data analysis generated three main themes: (1) transforming children and relationships, (2) hospitalization in a digital world, and (3) ICTs as a promising bridge back to school. Study findings provide insight into the experience of hospital isolation for children and adolescents, while highlighting the positive social as well as academic outcomes of frequent, open ended ICT use throughout hospital isolation. This is timely, given the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and its resulting isolation. Considerations for hospital social workers to promote relationships and connection, while facilitating a smooth transition as these children return to school are included.","Sawyer, Jami-Leigh; Mishna, Faye; Bouffet, Eric; Saini, Michael; Zlotnik-Shaul, Randi",Child Adolesc Social Work J,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10560-021-00764-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34025015/,264

MHPCs proliferate indefinitely in vitro without chromosomal alteration and telomere shortening. These cells possess hepatic progenitor cell-specific gene expression profiles with potential to differentiate into both hepatocytic and cholangiocytic lineages in vitro and in vivo and also can be genetically modified. Importantly, injected MHPCs repopulated the injured liver of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah)-deficient mice with hepatocyte-like cells. MHPCs also engraft as cholangiocytes into bile ducts of 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC)-induced bile ductular injured mice. MHPCs provide a tool to enable efficient derivation and genetic modification of both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes for use in disease modeling, tissue engineering, and drug screening.","Guo, Zhenglong; Jing, Renwei; Rao, Quan; Zhang, Ludi; Gao, Yimeng; Liu, Fengyong; Wang, Xin; Hui, Lijian; Yin, HaiFang",Cell Discov,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41421-018-0020-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29796307/,264

This study aimed to determine whether positive fecal immunochemistry test (FIT) results are associated with death from various causes in the South Korean population. Methods Using the Korean National Cancer Screening Program database, we collected data on patients who underwent FIT between 2009 and 2011. Results Of the 5,932,544 participants, 380,789 (6.4%) had positive FIT results. FIT-positive participants had a higher mortality rate than FIT-negative participants from CRC (1.33 and 0.21 per 1,000 person-years, p < 0.001, respectively) and non-CRC causes (10.40 and 7.50 per 1,000 person-years, p < 0.001, respectively). Despite adjusting for age, sex, smoking status, alcohol consumption habits, body mass index, comorbidity, and aspirin use, FIT positivity was associated with an increased risk of dying from all non-CRC causes (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15 to 1.18) and CRC (aHR, 5.61; 95% CI, 5.40 to 5.84). Additionally, FIT positivity was significantly associated with increased mortality from circulatory disease (aHR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.17), respiratory disease (aHR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.19), digestive disease (aHR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.48 to 1.66), neuropsychological disease (aHR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.16), blood and endocrine diseases (aHR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.17), and external factors (aHR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.20).

682287,AML-075: Converting In-Person Research Procedures to a Virtual Platform During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients,2021-09-30,"Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a pain disorder characterized by chronic widespread pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance, in the absence of any well-defined underlying organic disease. The exact pathophysiology and the mechanism which links different factors related to the disease is still unknown. Due to unknown precise pathogenesis, the coexistence of other diseases, and overlapping clinical features, FMS diagnosis may be laborious. Various treatment strategies are used, only a few Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, still we are facing challenges regarding effective treatment. Recently, medicinal cannabis has proven to be effective in chronic pain conditions such as osteoarthritis, neuropathic pain, and other non-cancer chronic pain. However, further research is needed about how the cannabinoid system works with the pain pathway. Using the fact that medicinal cannabis is effective in the treatment of chronic pain and certain rheumatic diseases, in this review, we aim to analyze the role of the cannabinoid system in fibromyalgia syndrome. We followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines in searching PubMed, MEDLINE (through PubMed), PubMed Central, and Google Scholar using keywords ""fibromyalgia, chronic pain, cannabis, cannabinoids, pharmacotherapy, alternative therapy"" and Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) words. After applying inclusion/exclusion criteria and checking for the quality assessment, 22 articles were retrieved and used for the analysis of the role of cannabis in the treatment of fibromyalgia. The two main compounds of cannabis with analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties are cannabidiol (CBD) and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and their ratio determines the effect on various symptoms of FMS. We included studies regarding the use of cannabinoids in the treatment of fibromyalgia, investigating the use of nabilone, dronabinol (a synthetic analog of THC), Bedrocan (22.4 mg THC, <1 mg CBD), Bediol (13.4 mg THC, 17.8 mg CBD), and Bedrolite (18.4 mg CBD, <1 mg THC). In the era of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and opioid crisis, many adverse outcomes are observed in the patients suffering from FMS due to lack of any definitive treatment and promising outcomes from the known treatment options, which led to the need for effective and safer treatment alternatives. Although the studies reviewed in this article suggest that medical cannabis is a safe and effective treatment for fibromyalgia pain, several limitations regarding dosage, length of treatment, adverse effects, long-term follow-up, and dependence needs further investigation.","Khurshid, Hajra; Qureshi, Israa A; Jahan, Nasrin; Went, Terry R; Sultan, Waleed; Sapkota, Alisha; Alfonso, Michael",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34567876/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.17332,264

We investigated risk factors for the HSAR among non-spousal household contacts of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We studied household contacts of index cases of COVID-19 in Tsuchiura, Japan, from August 2020 through February 2021. The HSARs of the whole household contacts and non-spousal household contacts were calculated and compared across risk factors. We used a generalized linear mixed regression model for multivariate analysis. We enrolled 496 household contacts of 236 index COVID-19 cases.

The HSAR was lower for non-spousal household contacts with a household size (number of household members) of two (18.2%), compared to the HSAR for contacts with a household size ≥4. The HSAR was higher for non-spousal household contacts of index patients with ≥3 days of diagnostic delay (period between onset and diagnosis) (26.0%) compared to those with ≤2 days’ delay (12.5%) (p = 0.033). Among non-spousal household contacts, the HSAR was low for those with a household size of two and was high for contacts of index patients with a long diagnostic delay.","Ogata, Tsuyoshi; Irie, Fujiko; Ogawa, Eiko; Ujiie, Shifuko; Seki, Aina; Wada, Koji; Tanaka, Hideo",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501511/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18178921,264

683000,A small case series about safety and effectiveness of a hypofractionated electron beam radiotherapy schedule in five fractions for facial non melanoma skin cancer among frail and elderly patients,2021-02-25,"Background: Vitamin D and calcium are important dietary compounds that affect bone mass, even if other minerals (potassium, zinc, etc.) and vitamins (A, C and K) are also involved. Vitamin D and certain minerals, in fact, play an important role in calcium homeostasis and calcium absorption. Hip fracture incidence is higher in Europe and the United States, where calcium is frequently included in the human diet; while the occurrence of these fractures is lower in developing countries, where diets are often poor in calcium. This condition is named the “calcium paradox”, and may be partially explained by phosphate toxicity, which can negatively affect mineral metabolism. It is important to maintain correct dietary calcium-phosphate balance in order to have a healthy life, reducing the risk of osteoporotic fractures in older people. Vitamin D can also act as a hormone; vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) is derived from the UV-B radiation of ergosterol, the natural vitamin D precursor detected in plants, fungi, and invertebrates. Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is synthesized by sunlight exposure from 7-dehydrocholesterol, a precursor of cholesterol that can also act as provitamin D3. Dietary intake of vitamin D3 is essential when the skin is exposed for short periods to ultraviolet B light (UV-B), a category of invisible light rays such as UV-A and UV-C. This can be considered the usual situation in northern latitudes during the winter season, or the typical lifestyle for older people and/or for people with very white delicate skin. The actual recommended daily intake of dietary vitamin D is strictly correlated with age, ranging from 5 μg for infants, children, teenagers, and adults—including pregnant and lactating women—to 15 μg for people over 65 years.","Polzonetti, Valeria; Pucciarelli, Stefania; Vincenzetti, Silvia; Polidori, Paolo",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32532150/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12061743,264

The rate of COVID-19 in children is lower than adults; however, due to high transmission rate, the number of reported cases in children has been increasing. With the rising numbers among children, it is imperative to develop preparedness plans for the pediatric population at the hospital level, departmental level, and patient care areas. This paper summarizes important considerations for pediatric hospital preparedness at the hospital level that includes workforce, equipment, supply; capacity planning, and infection prevention strategies, it also span over the management of COVID-19 pediatric patients in high-risk areas such as critical care areas, Emergency Department and operative rooms.","Kazzaz, Yasser M.; Alkhalaf, Hamad; Alharbi, Musaed; Al Shaalan, Mohammed; Almuneef, Maha; Alshehri, Ali; Alali, Hamza; AlHarbi, Talal; Alzughaibi, Nezar; Alatassi, Abdulaleem; Mahmoud, Ahmed Haroun; Aljuhani, Talal; AlSaad, Ahmad; Alqanatish, Jubran; Aldubayee, Mohammed; Malik, Amna; Al Amri, Asma; Al Shebil, Saleh; Al Onazi, Milfi; Al Mutrafy, Abdullah F.; Al Moamary, Mohamed S.",Ann Thorac Med,https://doi.org/10.4103/atm.atm_212_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831931/,264

Countries have developed strategies to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic that fit their epidemiological situations, capacities, and values. We describe China's strategies for prevention and control of COVID-19 (containment and suppression) and their application, from the perspective of the COVID-19 experience to date in China. Although China has contained severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and nearly stopped indigenous transmission, a strong suppression effort must continue to prevent re-establishment of community transmission from importation-related cases. We believe that case finding and management, with identification and quarantine of close contacts, are vitally important containment measures and are essential in China's pathway forward. We describe the next steps planned in China that follow the containment effort. We believe that sharing countries' experiences will help the global community manage the COVID-19 pandemic by identifying what works in the struggle against SARS-CoV-2.","Li, Zhongjie; Chen, Qiulan; Feng, Luzhao; Rodewald, Lance; Xia, Yinyin; Yu, Hailiang; Zhang, Ruochen; An, Zhijie; Yin, Wenwu; Chen, Wei; Qin, Ying; Peng, Zhibin; Zhang, Ting; Ni, Daxin; Cui, Jinzhao; Wang, Qing; Yang, Xiaokun; Zhang, Muli; Ren, Xiang; Wu, Dan; Sun, Xiaojin; Li, Yuanqiu; Zhou, Lei; Qi, Xiaopeng; Song, Tie; Gao, George F; Feng, Zijian",Lancet,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673620312782; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673620312782; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(20)31278-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32505220/,264

To introduce a multidisciplinary approach for the management of COVID-19-infected patients and to report the first operated patient in the Corona unit. METHODS: A detailed presentation of the hospital plan for a separate Corona unit with its intensive care unit and operating rooms. Description of the management of the first spine surgery case treated in this unit. RESULTS: The Corona unit showed a practical approach for the management of an emergency cervical spine fracture-dislocation with acute paralysis. The patient is 92-year-old female. The mechanism of injury was a simple fall during the stay in the internal medicine department where the patient was treated in the referring hospital. The patient had no other injuries and was awake and oriented. The patient did not have the clinical symptom of COVID-19, and the test result of COVID-19 done in the referring hospital was not available on admission in our emergency room. Education of the medical staff and organization of the operating theatre facilitated the management of the patient without an increased risk of spreading the infection. CONCLUSIONS: The current COVID-19 pandemic requires an extra-ordinary organization of the medical and surgical care of the patients. It is possible to manage an infected or a potentially infected patient surgically, but a multidisciplinary plan is necessary to protect other patients and the medical staff.","Alhashash, Mohamed; Elsebaiy, Walaa; Farag, Mohamed; Shousha, Mootaz",Eur Spine J,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00586-020-06625-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33095369/,264
687496,Potential mechanisms of hemorrhagic stroke in elderly COVID-19 patients,2020-06-11,"Summary A central nervous system (CNS) disorder characterized by non-suppurative encephalomyelitis with neurological signs was induced experimentally in gnotobiotic pigs by intravenous and oral or intranasal inoculation of the porcine teschovirus (PTV) Toyama 2002 strain isolated from breeding pigs in Japan. Lesions consisting of perivascular cuffing of mononuclear cells, focal gliosis, neuronal necrosis and neuronophagia were observed in the brainstem, cerebellum and spinal cord. Non-suppurative ganglionitis in the spinal ganglion and neuritis in the spinal root were also observed. Regardless of the route of inoculation, all pigs infected experimentally with PTV showed a similar distribution of CNS lesions. Histological lesions in the CNS caused by oral or intranasal inoculation of the virus were mild compared with those induced by intravenous infection. Immunohistochemically, the distribution of PTV antigens corresponded closely with the distribution of brain lesions. PTV particles were detected via electron microscopy in the cytoplasm of nerve cells and the endothelial cells of blood vessels in the spinal cord of inoculated pigs. Polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated the presence of PTV RNA in the CNS, tonsils and large intestines of 21 of the 22 pigs inoculated. Direct CNS invasion via the blood vessels appears to be a major route of infection for PTV. The gnotobiotic pig provides a useful model for further study of PTV pathogenesis.","Yamada, M.; Miyazaki, A.; Yamamoto, Y.; Nakamura, K.; Ito, M.; Tsunemitsu, H.; Narita, M.",Journal of Comparative Pathology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcpa.2013.08.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021997513001370; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24650890/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021997513001370,264
687732,Clinical evaluation of potential usefulness of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia,2020-07-06,"OBJECTIVE: Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator is the core medical therapy of acute ischaemic stroke (AIS). COVID‐19 infection negatively modifies acute stroke procedures and, due to its pro‐coagulative effect, may potentially impact on IVT outcome. Thus, short‐term efficacy and safety of IVT were compared in patients with and without evidence of SARS‐CoV‐2. METHODS: An observational, retrospective study included 70 patients with AIS, including 22 subjects (31%) with evidence of acute COVID‐19 infection, consecutively treated with IVT in 4 stroke centres between 15 September and 30 November 2020. RESULTS: Patients infected with COVID‐19 were characterized by higher median of National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score (11.0 vs. 6.5; p < .01) and D‐dimers (870 vs. 570; p = .03) on admission, higher presence of pneumonia (47.8% vs. 12%; p < .01) and lower percentage of ‘minor stroke symptoms’ (NIHSS 1–5 pts.) (2% vs., 18%; p < .01). Hospitalizations were longer in patients with COVID‐19 than in those without it (17 vs. 9 days, p < .01), but impact of COVID‐19 infection on patients’ in‐hospital mortality or functional status on dismission has been confirmed neither in uni‐ or multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: SARS‐CoV‐2 infection prolongs length of stay in hospital after IVT, but does not influence in‐hospital outcome.","Sobolewski, Piotr; Antecki, Jacek; Brola, Waldemar; Fudala, Małgorzata; Bieniaszewski, Leszek; Kozera, Grzegorz",Acta Neurol Scand,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34415051/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ane.13520,264

There is paucity of literature on such presentations after clinical and microbiological recovery. In the present case series, we present five such patients recently managed at our COVID-19 care facility. All the patients described were elderly (mean age: 66 years) with multiple comorbidities (mean Charlson Comorbidity Index score: 3.5). Two were initially managed at another COVID care facility and discharged. They were admitted at our center within one week of discharge. One patient who was managed at our center was discharged and then readmitted. The other two had recovered from their illness and were planned for discharge (mean duration of hospital stay in initial admission: 14.4 days). All presented within one week of clinical and microbiological recovery (mean: 4.2 days). All were on adequate anticoagulation during initial presentation. All these patients had raised D-dimer levels (three suffered sudden cardiac arrest, one had a confirmed pulmonary thromboembolism, and one had acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction). Thromboembolic complications should be considered an important differential diagnosis in all patients who present with any complication in the immediate follow-up period of recovery from COVID-19 disease. Repeat analysis of D-dimer levels at follow-up may be considered in those who recovered from severe disease. Extended period of anticoagulation and close follow-up may be considered in all patients with COVID-19 who are at high risk of developing thromboembolic complications.","Dawra, Saurabh; Shrivastava, Sharad; Kumar, Dharmendra; Asturkar, Vikram; Kumar, Ankit; Ahmad, Faiz; Nanda, Subrat",Med J Armed Forces India,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377123721000514; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0377123721000514; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mjafi.2021.02.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34334914/,264

Little information exists on perceptions of nutritional advice to eat more food to maintain health and enhance performance. The aim of this study was to explore athletes’ and coaches’ perceptions towards advice to athletes to eat larger than their current quantities of food and to explore how nutritionists could deliver this advice. Methods: Semi-structured interviews (~20 min in length) were conducted using online communication technology, audio-recorded, and transcribed verbatim. The interview explored perceptions of the nutritional advice provided, its role in health and performance, and the challenges to eating larger amounts of food. Data were analysed using NVIVO 1.2 using an inductive thematic approach. Results: Nine elite athletes (female = 6; males = 3) and nine high-performance coaches (female = 3; male = 6) completed the semi-structured interviews. Athletes reported improved training consistency, fewer injuries and illnesses, and improved resilience when consuming adequate energy and nutrients to meet their needs. Lack of time and meal preparation difficulties were the main challenges faced to fuelling. Conclusions: Although education about under-fuelling is important, motivating, enabling, and supporting athletes to change behaviour is pivotal to increasing athlete self-awareness and to make long-term nutritional changes.","Logue, Danielle M.; Mahony, Laura; Corish, Clare A.; Tobin, David; Doherty, Ronan; O’Higgins, Grainne; Madigan, Sharon M.",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34205107/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13061925,264

However, clinical diagnosis requires resources that are frequently restricted to the severely ill. Cohort studies may have to rely on surrogate indicators of COVID-19 illness. We describe the prevalence and overlap of five potential indicators: self-reported suspicion, self-reported core symptoms, symptom algorithm, self-reported routine test results, and home antibody testing. MethodsAn occupational cohort of staff and postgraduate students at a large London university who participated in surveys and antibody testing. Self-report items cover March to June 2020 and antibody test results from lateral flow IgG/IgM antibody test cassettes sent to participants in June 2020. ResultsValid antibody test results were returned for 1882 participants. Of the COVID-19 indicators, the highest prevalence was core symptoms (770 participants positive, 41%), followed by participant suspicion of infection (n=509, 27%), a symptom algorithm (n=297, 16%), study antibody positive test (n=124, 6.6%) and self-report of a positive external test (n=39, 2.1%). Study antibody positive result was rare in people who had no suspicion they had experienced COVID-19 (n=4, 0.7%) or did not experience core symptoms (n=10, 1.6%). When study antibody test results were compared with earlier external antibody results in those who had reported them, the study antibody results agreed in 88% cases (kappa= 0.636), with a lower proportion testing positive on this occasion (proportion with antibodies detected 15% in study test vs 24% in external testing). DiscussionOur results demonstrate that there is some agreement between different COVID indicators, but that they a more complete story when used together. Antibody testing may provide greater certainty and be one of the only ways to detect asymptomatic cases, but is likely to under-ascertain due to weak antibody responses to mild infection, which wane over time. Cohort studies will need to review how they deal with different and sometimes conflicting indicators of COVID-19 illness in order to study the long-term outcomes of COVID-19 infection and related impacts. What is already known on this subject?Research into the effects of COVID-19 in the community is needed to respond to the pandemic. Objective testing has not been widely available and accuracy may not be high when carried out in retrospect. Many cohort studies are considering how best to measure COVID-19 infection status. What this study adds?Antibody testing is feasible, but it is possible that sensitivity may be poor. Each indicator included added different aspects to the ascertainment of COVID-19 exposure. Using combinations of self-reported and objectively measured variables, it may be possible to tailor COVID-19 indicators to the situation.","Davis, Katrina A S; Carr, Ewan; Leightley, Daniel; Vitiello, Valentina; Cartwright, Gabriella Bergin; Lavelle, Grace; Wickersham, Alice; Malim, Michael H; Oetzmann, Carolin; Polling, Catherine; Stevelink, Sharon A.M.; Razavi, Reza; Hotopf, Matthew; team, - KCL-CHECK research",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.07.20245183v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.07.20245183,264
