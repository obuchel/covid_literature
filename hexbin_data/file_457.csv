4833,4833,4833,Aberrant remyelination of axons after heat injury in the dorsal funiculus of rat spinal cord,9.745304,4.9369106,1991,"The mechanism of brain infection with mouse hepatitis virus-JHM was studied in BALB/cByJ mice following intranasal inoculation, and found to be a consequence of direct viral spread along olfactory nerves into olfactory bulbs of the brain. Infection was followed sequentially from nose to brain, using microscopy, immunohistochemistry and virus quantification. Lesions, antigen and virus were observed in the olfactory bulb and anterior brain as early as 2 days and posterior brain by 4 days after inoculation. Viral antigen extended through nasal mucosa into submucosa, then coursed along the olfactory nerve perineurium and fibers, through the cribriform plate into the olfactory bulbs. On days 4 and 7, viral antigen was found in the antero-ventral brain, along ventral meninges, olfactory tracts and anterior ramifications of the lateral ventricles. Virus was cleared from nose by 10 days and anterior brain by 20 days, but persisted in posterior brain for 20 days after inoculation. Mice also developed disseminated infection, with viremia and hepatitis. Infection of brain did not correlate with presence of viremia. In contrast to intranasally inoculated mice, orally-inoculated mice did not develop encephalitis, despite evidence of disseminated infection.","Barthold, S. W.",Acta Neuropathol,457,1

The animals were from beef and dairy cattle herds (n = 321) from 158 counties in seven States (Paraná, São Paulo, Minas Gerais, Mato Grosso do Sul, Mato Grosso, Goiás and Rondônia) and four Brazilian geographical regions (south, south-east, centre-west, and north). GpA BRV was detected in 19.4% (369/1898; p = 0.0001) of the samples collected in calves with diarrhoea and in only 2.2% (6/279; p = 0.0001) of the faeces with normal consistency. The proportion of positive samples collected from beef and dairy cattle herds was 22.8% (205/899; p = 0.0001) and 16.4% (169/999; p = 0.0005), respectively. In relation to age, a higher prevalence of infections was found in calves up to 30 days old, where 33.0% (189/573; p = 0.0001) and 20.2% (138/683; p = 0.0001) of the diarrhoeic faecal samples from beef and dairy cattle herds, respectively, were positive for gpA BRV. These results show the possible importance of inclusion of gpA BRV in the management of neonatal calf diarrhoea in Brazilian cattle herds.","Alfieri, A. A.; Parazzi, M. E.; Takiuchi, E.; Médici, K.

Although increased dead-space ventilation (V(D)/V(T)) has been described in ARDS, its mechanism is not clearly understood. We sought to evaluate the relationships between dynamic variations in V(D)/V(T) and extra-pulmonary microcirculatory blood flow detected at sublingual mucosa hypothesizing that an altered microcirculation, which is a generalized phenomenon during severe inflammatory conditions, could influence ventilation/perfusion mismatching manifested by increases in V(D)/V(T) fraction during early stages of ARDS. METHODS: Forty-two consecutive patients with early moderate and severe ARDS were included. PEEP was set targeting the best respiratory-system compliance after a PEEP-decremental recruitment maneuver. After 60 min of stabilization, hemodynamics and respiratory mechanics were recorded and blood gases collected. V(D)/V(T) was calculated from the CO(2) production ([Formula: see text] ) and CO(2) exhaled fraction ([Formula: see text] ) measurements by volumetric capnography. Sublingual microcirculatory images were simultaneously acquired using a sidestream dark-field device for an ulterior blinded semi-quantitative analysis. All measurements were repeated 24 h after. RESULTS: Percentage of small vessels perfused (PPV) and microcirculatory flow index (MFI) were inverse and significantly related to V(D)/V(T) at baseline (Spearman’s rho = − 0.76 and − 0.63, p < 0.001; R(2) = 0.63, and 0.48, p < 0.001, respectively) and 24 h after (Spearman’s rho = − 0.71, and − 0.65; p < 0.001; R(2) = 0.66 and 0.60, p < 0.001, respectively). Other respiratory, macro-hemodynamic and oxygenation parameters did not correlate with V(D)/V(T). Variations in PPV between baseline and 24 h were inverse and significantly related to simultaneous changes in V(D)/V(T) (Spearman’s rho = − 0.66, p < 0.001; R(2) = 0.67, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Increased heterogeneity of microcirculatory blood flow evaluated at sublingual mucosa seems to be related to increases in V(D)/V(T), while respiratory mechanics and oxygenation parameters do not. Whether there is a cause–effect relationship between microcirculatory dysfunction and dead-space ventilation in ARDS should be addressed in future research.","Ospina-Tascón, Gustavo A.; Bautista, Diego F.; Madriñán, Humberto J.; Valencia, Juan D.; Bermúdez, William F.; Quiñones, Edgardo; Calderón-Tapia, Luis Eduardo; Hernandez, Glenn; Bruhn, Alejandro; De Backer, Daniel",Ann Intensive Care,457,12

A monocentric prospective longitudinal study including infants aged under 1 year with acute bronchiolitis was performed, with clinical (severity score), biological (serum Krebs von den Lungen 6 antigen), and viral (14 virus by naso‐pharyngeal suction detection) assessments. Follow‐up included a quaterly telephone interview, and a final clinical examination at 3 years. Biological markers of atopy were also measured in peripheral blood, including specific IgEs towards aero‐ and food allergens. Complete data were available for 154 children. 46.8% of them had recurrent wheezing (RW). No difference was found according to initial severity, care at home or in the hospital, respiratory virus involved, or existence of co‐infection. A familial history of atopy was identified as a risk factor for recurrent bronchial obstruction (60% for RW infants versus 39%, P = 0.02), as living in an apartment (35% versus 15%, P = 0.002). 18.6% of the infants were sensitized, with 48.1% of them sensitized to aeroallergens and 81.5% to food allergens. Multivariate analysis confirmed that a familial history of atopy (P = 0.02) and initial co‐infection RSV‐hRV (P = 0.02) were correlated with the risk of sensitization to aeroallergens at 3 years. Familial history of atopy and RSV‐hRV co‐infection are risk factors for recurrent bronchial obstruction and sensitization.","Amat, Flore; Plantard, Chloé; Mulliez, Aurélien; Petit, Isabelle; Rochette, Emmanuelle; Verdan, Matthieu; Henquell, Cécile; Labbé, Guillaume; Heraud, Marie Christine; Evrard, Bertrand; Labbé, André",J Med Virol,457,1

Co-infection can be either viral-viral or viral-bacterial and with new technology there is more information on the role they play on the health of children. RECENT FINDINGS: With the proliferation of multiplex PCR for rapid diagnosis of multiple viruses as well as innovations on identification of bacterial infections, research has been attempting to discover how these co-infections affect each other and the host. Studies are aiming to discern if the epidemiology of viruses seen at a population level is related to the interaction between different viruses on a host level. Studies are also attempting to discover the burden of morbidity and mortality of these viral-viral co-infections on the pediatric population. It is also becoming important to understand the interplay of certain viruses with specific bacteria and understanding the impact of viral-bacterial co-infections. SUMMARY: RSV continues to contribute to a large burden of disease for pediatric patients with acute respiratory illnesses. However, recent literature suggests that viral-viral co-infections do not add to this burden and might, in some cases, be protective of severe disease. Viral-bacterial co-infections, on the other hand, are most likely adding to the burden of morbidity in pediatric patients because of the synergistic way they can infect the nasopharyngeal space. Future research needs to focus on confirming these conclusions as it could affect hospital cohorting, role of molecular testing, and therapeutic interventions.","Meskill, Sarah D.; O’Bryant, Shelease C.",Curr Infect Dis Rep,457,1

Strong social bonds are essential for health and wellbeing, but often health conditions can detrimentally affect a person’s ability to interact with others. This can become a vicious cycle resulting in further decline in health. For this reason, the social management of health is an important aspect of healthcare. We propose that socially assistive robots (SARs) could help people with health conditions maintain positive social lives by supporting them in social interactions. This paper makes three contributions, as detailed below. We develop a framework of social mediation functions that robots could perform, motivated by the special social needs that people with health conditions have. In this framework we identify five types of functions that SARs could perform: (a) changing how the person is perceived, (b) enhancing the social behavior of the person, (c) modifying the social behavior of others, (d) providing structure for interactions, and (e) changing how the person feels. We thematically organize and review the existing literature on robots supporting human–human interactions, in both clinical and non-clinical settings, and explain how the findings and design ideas from these studies can be applied to the functions identified in the framework. Finally, we point out and discuss challenges in designing SARs for supporting social interactions, and highlight opportunities for future robot design and HRI research on the mediator role of robots.","Chita-Tegmark, Meia; Scheutz, Matthias",Int J Soc Robot,457,1

While the function of PPAD in P. gingivalis physiology is not clear, human peptidylarginine deiminases are known to convert positively charged arginine residues within proteins to neutral citrulline and, thereby, impact protein conformation and function. Here, we report that the lack of citrullination in a PPAD deletion mutant (Δ8820) enhances biofilm formation. More Δ8820 cells attached to the surface than the parent strain during the early stages of biofilm development and, ultimately, mature Δ8820 biofilms were comprised of significantly more cell–cell aggregates and extracellular matrix. Imaging by electron microscopy discovered that Δ8820 biofilm cells secrete copious amounts of protein aggregates. Furthermore, gingipain-derived adhesin proteins, which are also secreted by the T9SS were predicted by mass spectrometry to be citrullinated and citrullination of these targets by wild-type strain 381 in vitro was confirmed. Lastly, Δ8820 biofilms contained more gingipain-derived adhesin proteins and more gingipain activity than 381 biofilms. Overall, our findings support the model that citrullination of T9SS cargo proteins known to play a key role in colonization, such as gingipain-derived adhesin proteins, is an underlying mechanism that modulates P. gingivalis biofilm development.","Vermilyea, Danielle M.; Ottenberg, Gregory K.; Davey, Mary E.",NPJ Biofilms Microbiomes,457,11
12703,12703,12703,Survey on current treatments for pain after spinal cord damage,9.66007,4.8519144,2019-02-05,"There are two glutamate dehydrogenases in the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans. One is an NAD(+)-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH2) and the other is an NADPH-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH3). These two enzymes are part of the nitrogen and nicotinate/nicotinamide metabolic pathways, which have been identified in our previous studies as potentially playing an important role in C. albicans morphogenesis. In this study, we created single gene knockout mutants of both dehydrogenases in order to investigate whether or not they affect the morphogenesis of C. albicans. The GDH genes were deleted and the phenotypes of the knockout mutants were studied by growth characterisation, metabolomics, isotope labelling experiments, and by quantifying cofactors under various hyphae-inducing conditions. We found that the gdh2/gdh2 mutant was unable to grow on either arginine or proline as a sole carbon and nitrogen source. While the gdh3/gdh3 mutant could grow on these carbon and nitrogen sources, the strain was locked in the yeast morphology in proline-containing medium. We detected different concentrations of ATP, NAD(+), NADH, NAPD(+), NADPH, as well as 62 other metabolites, and 19 isotopically labelled metabolites between the mutant and the wild-type strains. These differences were associated with 44 known metabolic pathways. It appears that the disequilibrium of cofactors in the gdh3/gdh3 mutant leads to characteristic proline degradation in the central carbon metabolism. The analysis of the gdh2/gdh2 and the gdh3/gdh3 mutants confirmed our hypothesis that redox potential and nitrogen metabolism are related to filament formation and identified these metabolic pathways as potential drug targets to inhibit morphogenesis.","Han, Ting-Li; Cannon, Richard D.; Gallo, Sandra M.; Villas-Bôas, Silas G.",NPJ Biofilms Microbiomes,457,1

METHODS: Four participants (C4–7, AIS A-C) completed 11 sessions of robotic training using a passive robotic exoskeleton (Armeo Spring®). Descriptive statistics and visual analyses were used for comparing standard occupational therapy and robotic training. Outcome measures included the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM-III), the Graded Redefined Assessment of Strength Sensibility and Prehension (GRASSP), and a questionnaire. RESULTS: All of the participants exhibited an increase in assessments of upper limb function (GRASSP-total) right side (0.4%–61.2%), and all except for one participant (−8%) showed an increase on their left side (20.9%–106.2%).

Surgical intervention is warranted in patients with significant neural deficits, and cauda equina syndrome and needs to be performed at the earliest in order to avoid irreversible neurological sequelae. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 29-year-old primigravida in her 21st week of gestational period, who was diagnosed with cauda equina syndrome secondary to two level lumbar disc herniations. The lengthier surgical duration in performing double level disc herniations in an obese patient raises concerns in anesthetic dosing of drugs and surgical positioning which may result in fetal distress. A double level decompression and discectomy in prone position was done under general anesthesia. Despite the surgical challenges, the postoperative period was uneventful resulting in immediate pain relief and complete neurological recovery, followed by the delivery of a 2.7-kg healthy male child. DISCUSSION: Surgical intervention can be performed in pregnancy, to avoid irreversible neurological deficits, even in an obese individual with double level lumbar pathology. However, it is essential that the surgeon appraises the situation and involves an integrated multidisciplinary team comprising anesthetist, spine surgeon, obstetrician, and psychologist, and inculcates certain precautions in the perioperative management to achieve good surgical and fetal outcomes.","S, Dilip Chand Raja; Shetty, Ajoy Prasad; Kanna, Rishi Mugesh; Rajasekaran, S",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,457,1

Ultrasonographic assessment of carpal tunnel revealed the presence of abnormal muscle in the carpal tunnel encroaching the median nerve dynamically.

OBJECTIVE: Spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts afferent input to the hypothalamus and impairs efferent vaso- and sudomotor output, especially in lesions above the sympathetic chain (T1-L2). In consequence, persons with SCI under heat stress experience impairment in the ability to dissipate heat proportional to the lesion level. Thermoregulatory dysfunction places an individual at high risk of hyperthermia, which can be life threatening, especially for athletes with SCI during exercise. Current evidence on therapeutic cooling techniques in athletes with SCI is limited, but basic physiologic and research data suggest water spray (WS) might be efficacious, particularly in athletes with tetraplegia (TP), who are most impaired in thermoregulation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of WS on core temperature (Tc) during exercise in athletes with SCI. SETTING: Texas, USA. METHODS: Eleven individuals with SCI: seven with TP, four with paraplegia (PP); and sixteen able-bodied (AB) controls underwent a wheelchair intermittent sprint exercise for 90 min under two conditions: (1) WS application every 15 min and (2) control (C), without WS. Tc was measured every 15 min and was analyzed for the effect of group (TP, PP, and AB) and time. Change in Tc (ΔTc) was also compared between groups. RESULTS: ΔTc was significantly higher in TP vs. PP (p < 0.0001) and TP vs. AB (p < 0.0001) groups under C treatment. WS significantly attenuated ΔTc in TP (p = 0.001), but did not change ΔTc in PP or AB. CONCLUSION: WS effectively attenuated Tc elevation during exercise in athletes with TP.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative value placed on different outcomes to be used in a pivotal trial for the upper extremity configuration of the Networked Neuroprosthesis (NNP) as well as the tolerance of the expected adverse event profile. SETTING: Academic medical center in the United States. METHODS: Distribution of an online survey to adults living with tetraplegia; extent of agreement with each question/statement was obtaining using a 1–7 Likert scale. RESULTS: There were 8 statements about potential benefits in arm/hand function; for all statements, more than 70% of participants rated the functions as “1-very important” to regain. There were variable degrees of concern related to risks that could occur during the 30-day post-surgical period and increasing degrees of concern related to risks that could occur in the first 5 years, potentially due to the device, based on the increasing degree of invasiveness of the intervention required to address the event. When analysing the results based on all degrees of interest, more than 64% of responders were interested in getting the NNP with a success rate threshold as low as 50% regardless of time post-injury. Chi-squared analyses revealed some associations between responses and sex, injury level, and injury duration; however, none of these were statistically significant upon post-hoc analysis.

METHOD: A description of methodological challenges experienced in collecting data from 78 persons with acute and chronic traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) examined and interviewed in 2015–2017 using a semiquantitative questionnaire and standard assessments tools. RESULTS: This study identified three major challenges with data collection in this setting: (1) research logistics and procedures, such as recruitment, infrastructure, and compensation, (2) ethical issues and the initial lack of mutual trust and understanding between researchers and participants, and (3) scientific quality and interpretation, including representativeness. CONCLUSIONS: Methodological issues influenced by settings, are important to consider when interpreting study results. Healthcare systems vary between (and sometimes in) countries, language and culture may introduce barriers to understanding, and epidemiological research also rely on infrastructure and surroundings. For this study, making time for and listening to the participants without being intruding was of special importance in building trust and a good relationship with the participants during recruiting participants and collecting data. We here provide suggestions regarding how to facilitate future epidemiological data collections in North Macedonia.","Kostovski, Emil; Miloshevska Jakimovska, Vesna; Lidal, Ingeborg Beate; Biering-Sørensen, Fin",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,457,1

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to characterize the approach to opioid prescription for persons with spinal cord damage (SCD). SETTING: An international online questionnaire. METHODS: A survey was posted online and circulated among international societies within the field of SCI medicine from August to November 2018. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-three physicians responded to the survey. Of these, 107 (92%) managed pain for persons with SCD. Most (82%) felt that opioid prescription was appropriate for uncontrolled acute pain, but fewer (67%) felt it was appropriate for chronic pain. Of those who felt opioids had a role in the treatment of neuropathic pain, 46% did not think there should be a specific upper limit of opioid dose. The majority (85%) would continue prescribing high doses (250 morphine milligram equivalent (MME) doses/day) if that dose were effective. Tramadol was the most common opioid prescribed first line. CONCLUSION: Most physicians who responded to this survey prescribe opioids for intractable pain after SCD. A significant proportion of respondents believed that there should not be a specific upper limit of opioid dose prescribed if the drug is tolerated; this does not align with current recommendations. Most physicians do not feel influenced in their prescribing habits by regulatory bodies. If physicians decide to taper an opioid that is being tolerated well, it is most commonly related to a fear of the patient developing an opioid-use disorder. The authors propose an algorithm that may help align practice patterns with current recommended practice guidelines.","Wong, Tiffany K.; Alexander, Marcalee Sipski; New, Peter Wayne; Delgado, Andrew D.; Bryce, Thomas N.",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,457,1

A comprehensive and systematic study of the evolutionary process of ALV-J in China is needed. In this study, we amplified the full-length viral cDNA sequences of 16 ALV-J isolates of Yellow-chicken origin and analyzed and compared these sequences with another 69 ALV-J strains isolated during the years 1988–2018. These isolates were then sorted into 2 clusters: cluster I included isolates that mainly originated from the layers and White-feather broilers from northern China; cluster II included isolates mainly from the Yellow-chicken, most of them being from southern China. According to the sequence homologies of the whole genome and gag, pol, gp85, and gp37 genes, the ALV-J strains are more likely to randomly change in different directions from the original strain HPRS-103 as time passes. The results of entropy analysis of the sequences of gag, pol, and env revealed that the env gene had the largest variation, and the gag gene nonconserved sites are mainly concentrated in p19, p10, and p12. In addition, 84.71% (72/85) of the isolates had the 205-nucleotide (nt) deletion in the 3′UTR region, and 30.59% (26/85) of the isolates had the 125-nt to 127-nt deletion in the E element. Our study provides evidence for the coexistence of 2 extremely different clusters of ALV-J prevailing in China and in some other countries during the period of 1988–2018 and implies that the clusters are highly dependent on the host genetic background and the geographic location.","Wang, Peikun; Li, Min; Li, Haijuan; Lin, Lulu; Shi, Mengya; Gu, Zhanming; Gao, Yanli; Huang, Teng; Mo, Meilan; Wei, Tianchao; Wei, Ping",Poult Sci,457,1

We hypothesized that patients who undergo a Modified Konno procedure would have a higher rate of LVOT re-intervention compared to the Konno procedure. Patients who underwent a Konno or Modified Konno procedure for LVOTO at a single tertiary care center between 1990 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. The primary outcome was LVOT re-intervention post-discharge from index Konno or Modified Konno procedure. Cox regression and Kaplan–Meier estimates were used for time-to-event analysis of LVOT re-interventions, any unplanned re-interventions, and transplant-free survival. The study included 122 patients: 51 (41.8%) in the Konno group and 71 (58.2%) in the Modified Konno group. Median age at surgery was 8.2 (IQR 3–16) years in the Konno group and 3.9 (IQR 1.5–11) years in the Modified Konno group. Multiple left heart lesions were less prevalent in Modified Konno patients. There were 36 (29.5%) patients with LVOT re-interventions: 8 (16%) in the Konno group and 28 (39.4%) in the Modified Konno group (p = 0.01). Transplant-free survival at five years was 87.2% for the Konno group and 93.5% for the Modified Konno group. A higher rate of LVOT re-intervention was found in the Modified Konno group although the Konno and Modified Konno techniques were applied to different patient populations. This finding suggests that careful preoperative decision-making can direct therapy appropriately and that fundamental diagnosis affects procedure choice.

18592,18592,18592,In-hospital mortality in people with complete acute traumatic spinal cord injury at a tertiary care center in India—a retrospective analysis,9.934544,5.0088863,2021-06-25,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, telemedicine consultations have evolved as a new form of providing primary healthcare. Telemedicine options can provide benefits to patients in terms of access, reduced travel time and no risk of disease spreading. However, concerns have been raised that access is not equally distributed in the population, which could lead to increased inequality in health. The aim of this paper is to explore the determinants for use of direct-to-consumer (DTC) telemedicine consultations in a setting where telemedicine is included in the publicly funded healthcare system. METHODS: To investigate factors associated with the use of DTC telemedicine, a database was constructed by linking national and regional registries covering the entire population of Stockholm, Sweden (N = 2.3 million). Logistic regressions were applied to explore the determinants for utilization in 2018. As comparators, face-to-face physician consultations in primary healthcare were included in the study, as well as digi-physical physician consultations, i.e., telemedicine consultations offered by traditional primary healthcare providers also offering face-to-face visits, and telephone consultations by nurses. RESULTS: The determinants for use of DTC telemedicine differed substantially from face-to-face visits but also to some extent from the other telemedicine options. For the DTC telemedicine consultations, the factors associated with higher probability of utilization were younger age, higher educational attainment, higher income and being born in Sweden. In contrast, the main determinants for use of face-to-face visits were higher age, lower educational background and being born outside of Sweden. CONCLUSION: The use of DTC telemedicine is determined by factors that are generally not associated with greater healthcare need and the distribution raises some concerns about the equity implications. Policy makers aiming to increase the level of telemedicine consultations in healthcare should consider measures to promote access for elderly and individuals born outside of Sweden to ensure that all groups have access to healthcare services according to their needs.

We take the elimination of a viral infection as a case for exploring mathematical models as ‘evidence‐making interventions’. Using interviews with mathematical modellers and implementation scientists, and focusing on the emergence of models of ‘treatment‐as‐prevention’ in hepatitis C control, we trace how projections detach from their calculative origins as social and policy practices. Drawing on the work of Michel Callon and others, we show that modelled projections of viral elimination circulate as ‘qualculations’, taking flight via their affects, including as anticipation. Modelled numerical targets do not need ‘actual numbers’ or precise measurements to perform their authority as evidence of viral elimination or as situated matters‐of‐concern. Modellers grapple with the ways that their models transform in policy and social practices, apparently beyond reasonable calculus. We highlight how practices of ‘holding‐on’ to projections in relation to imaginaries of ‘evidence‐based’ science entangle with the ‘letting‐go’ of models beyond calculus. We conclude that the ‘virtual precision’ of models affords them fluid evidence‐making potential. We imagine a different mode of modelling science in health, one more attuned to treating projections as qualculative, affective and relational, as excitable matter.","Rhodes, Tim; Lancaster, Kari",Sociol Health Illn,457,1

Secretion of saliva is dependent upon nerve-mediated stimuli, which activate glandular fluid and protein secretory mechanisms. The volume of saliva secreted by salivary glands depends upon the frequency and intensity of nerve-mediated stimuli, which increase dramatically with food intake and are subject to facilitatory or inhibitory influences within the central nervous system. Longer-term changes in saliva secretion have been found to occur in response to dietary change and aging, and these physiological influences can alter the composition and function of saliva in the mouth. Salivary gland dysfunction is associated with different diseases, including Sjögren syndrome, sialadenitis, and iatrogenic disease, due to radiotherapy and medications and is usually reported as a loss of secretory volume, which can range in severity. Defining salivary gland dysfunction by measuring salivary flow rates can be difficult since these vary widely in the healthy population. However, saliva can be sampled noninvasively and repeatedly, which facilitates longitudinal studies of subjects, providing a clearer picture of altered function. The application of omics technologies has revealed changes in saliva composition in many systemic diseases, offering disease biomarkers, but these compositional changes may not be related to salivary gland dysfunction. In Sjögren syndrome, there appears to be a change in the rheology of saliva due to altered mucin glycosylation. Analysis of glandular saliva in diseases or therapeutic interventions causing salivary gland inflammation frequently shows increased electrolyte concentrations and increased presence of innate immune proteins, most notably lactoferrin. Altering nerve-mediated signaling of salivary gland secretion contributes to medication-induced dysfunction and may also contribute to altered saliva composition in neurodegenerative disease.","Proctor, G.B.; Shaalan, A.M.",J Dent Res,457,33

In this chapter, a new measurement system is introduced to inform HIV/AIDS control cross the globe. All countries with data available on area size, total population and total number of persons living with HIV (PLWH) were included, yielding a sample of 148 countries. Four indicators, including the total count, population-based p rate, geographic area-based g rate and population and geographic area-based pg rate were used as a 4D system to describe the global HIV epidemic. The total PLWH count provided data informing resource allocation for individual countries to improve HIV/AIDS care; and the top five countries with highest PLWH count were South Africa, Nigeria, India, Kenya, and Mozambique. Information from the remaining three indicators provided a global risk profile of the HIV epidemic, supporting HIV/AIDS prevention programming strategies. Five countries with highest p rates were Swaziland, Botswana, Lesotho, South Africa, and Zimbabwe; five countries with highest g rates were Swaziland, Malawi, Lesotho, Rwanda, and Uganda; and five countries with highest pg rates were Barbados, Swaziland, Lesotho, Malta, and Mauritius. According to pg rates, two HIV hotspots (south and middle Africa and Caribbean region) and one HIV belt across Euro-Asian were identified. In addition to HIV/AIDS, the 4D measurement system can be used to describe morbidity and mortality for many diseases across the globe. We recommend the use of this measurement system in research to address significant global health and epidemiologic issues.","Chen, Xinguang; Yu, Bin; Chen, (Din) Ding-Geng",Statistical Methods for Global Health and Epidemiology,457,19

The immune system protects us from the majority of these pathogens as flatworms, bacteria, fungi, and viruses. We have also witnessed tremendous progress in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases; still, they remain a major challenge and are responsible for major cause of death and disability worldwide. The immune system’s memory response and vaccination have resulted in complete eradication of many diseases. Our immune system is very adaptive and consists of a variety of cells and molecules, which play an active role in protecting us. It not only protects us from the outside pathogenic agents but also is also capable of recognizing the body’s own components. It recognizes them as self and does not induce response against them. It is known as self-/non-self-discrimination. Sometimes due to certain defects or other reasons when the immune system is not able to differentiate self, then it mounts an attack on self-components leading to autoimmunity. The importance of the immune system was recognized by early work of Dr. Edward Jenner and Louis Pasteur; they recognized the abilities of the immune system, and since then the system was gradually being explored and it laid the foundation of immunology. However, day-by-day microbes are also posing health risks as new strains are continuously being evolved. Many chemotherapeutic agents have been developed to control the spread and infections. However, microbes are also continuously developing the ability of their survival with emergence of new strains and properties. Antibiotic resistance is occurring with all classes of microbes posing a serious clinical problem in managing infections. The diseases like tuberculosis, cholera, and rheumatic fever, which were believed to be eradicated, have ferociously reemerged. The reemergence and new pathogenic agents might be the result of mutations in their genome and changes occurring in the environment. In this chapter, basic concept of the immune system and some of the diseases of the skin, gastrointestinal tract, nervous system, and respiratory system caused by microorganisms are discussed along with sexually transmitted diseases and characterization of pathogens.","Gupta, Varsha; Sengupta, Manjistha; Prakash, Jaya; Tripathy, Baishnab Charan",Basic and Applied Aspects of Biotechnology,457,19

We now expect global GDP growth to slow to just 1.9% y/y in Q1 this year and have lowered our forecast for 2020 as a whole from 2.5% to 2.3%, down from 2.6% in 2019. ▀ Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, there had been signs that the worst was over for both world trade and the manufacturing sector. However, this tentative optimism has been dashed by the current disruption. ▀ While the near‐term impact of the virus is uncertain, the disruption to China will clearly be significant in Q1 – we expect Chinese GDP growth to plunge to just 3.8% y/y. Even though growth there will rebound in Q2 and Q3, it will take time for the loss in activity to be fully recovered and we now expect GDP growth of just 5.4% for 2020 as a whole, a downward revision of 0.6pp from last month. ▀ Weaker Chinese imports and tourism and disruption to global supply chains will take a toll on the rest of the world, particularly in the Asia‐Pacific region. And the shock will exacerbate the ongoing slowdown in the US and may result in the eurozone barely expanding for a second quarter running in Q1. ▀ Weaker oil demand in the short term has prompted us to lower our Brent oil price forecast. We have cut our projection for growth in crude demand in 2020 by 0.2m b/d to 0.9 mb/d and now forecast Brent crude will average $62.4pb in 2020, down from about $65pb in our January forecast. ▀ Quarterly global growth is likely to strengthen a little in H2 this year as the disruption fades and firms make up for the lost output earlier in the year and the effect of China's policy response starts to feed through.

METHODS: In total, 983 children diagnosed with community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia were enrolled between January 2010 and December 2015. RESULTS: Proportions of pneumococcal vaccinations increased each year in age-stratified groups with PCV7 (32.2%) as the majority, followed by PCV13 (12.2%).

Despite evidence of its effectiveness, MBC is rarely adopted in routine substance use disorder (SUD) treatment settings and little is known about the factors that may improve its adoptability in these settings. The current study gathered qualitative data from SUD treatment clinicians about their perceptions of MBC, the clinical outcomes they would most like to monitor in MBC, and suggestions for the design and implementation of MBC systems in their settings. METHODS: Fifteen clinicians from one publicly-funded and two privately-funded outpatient SUD treatment clinics participated in one-on-one research interviews. Interviews focused on clinicians’ perceived benefits, drawbacks, and ideas related to implementing MBC technology into their clinical workflows. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and coded to allow for thematic analysis using a mixed deductive and inductive approach. Clinicians also completed a card sorting task to rate the perceived helpfulness of routinely measuring and monitoring different treatment outcomes. RESULTS: Clinicians reported several potential benefits of MBC, including improved patient-provider communication, client empowerment, and improved communication between clinicians. Clinicians also expressed potential drawbacks, including concerns about subjectivity in patient self-reports, limits to personalization, increased time burdens, and needing to learn to use new technologies. Clinicians generated several ideas and preferences aimed at minimizing burden of MBC, illustrating clinical changes over time, improving ease of use, and improving personalization. Numerous patient outcomes were identified as “very helpful” to track, including coping skills, social support, and motivation for change. CONCLUSIONS: MBC may be a beneficial tool for improving clinical care in SUD treatment settings. MBC tools may be particularly adoptable if they are compatible with existing workflows, help illustrate gradual and nonlinear progress in SUD treatment, measure outcomes perceived as clinically useful, accommodate multiple use cases and stakeholder groups, and are framed as an additional source of information meant to augment, rather than replace, existing practices and information sources.

Undergoing subsequent diagnostic MRI examinations poses a safety concern due to the possibility of radiofrequency heating of the metallic braid incorporated into the microcatheter. Heating of nitinol, tungsten, and polyetheretherketone (PEEK) braided microcatheters was assessed and compared using a phantom model. METHODS Microcatheters coupled with fluoroptic temperature probes were embedded in a polyacrylamide gel within a head and torso phantom. Experiments were performed at 1.5 T and 3 T, analyzing the effects of different catheter immersion lengths, specific absorption rate (SAR) levels, short clinical scans, long clinical scans, and microcatheter fragment lengths. RESULTS The maximal increase in temperature for the nitinol braided microcatheter during a 15 min scan was 3.06°C using the T1 fast spin echo sequence at 1.5 T and 0.45°C using the balanced steady state free precession sequence at 3 T. The same scans for fragment lengths of 9, 18, 36, and 72 cm produced maximal temperature rises of 0.68, 0.80, 1.70, and 1.07°C at 1.5 T, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS Substantial heating of nitinol braided microcatheters occurred and was a function of SAR level and geometric considerations. SAR and time limitations on MR scanning are proposed for patients with this microcatheter entrapped in their vasculature.

We aimed at evaluating the impact of COVID-19 emergency on the management of people with epilepsy (PWE) living in the rural communities of the Gran Chaco area of the Plurinational State of Bolivia. MATERIALS AND METHODS We selected a sample of PWE living in the rural communities of the Bolivian Chaco. A standardized questionnaire was developed, consisting of six questions addressing drug availability, drug discontinuation, personnel responsible for drug retrieval during the lockdown, and the presence of seizures in the two months preceding the interview. Questionnaires were administered by community health workers of the rural health centers in September 2020. RESULTS Seventy PWE (38 men, 54.3%; mean age 26.9 ± 16.7) were interviewed. During the lockdown the large majority of them (n = 51, 73.9%) reported an irregular medication intake mainly due to the lack of antiseizure medications in the local health posts, leading to an increase in seizure frequency. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic has unmasked the frailty of the Bolivian health system, especially for the management of chronic diseases such as epilepsy in the rural communities.","Nicoletti, Alessandra; Todaro, Valeria; Cicero, Calogero Edoardo; Giuliano, Loretta; Zappia, Mario; Cosmi, Francesco; Vilte, Estela; Bartoloni, Alessandro; Crespo Gómez, Elizabeth Blanca",Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,457,1

However, in our experience, the use of a transparent film can alter skin images. Our study aimed to compare the optical quality of a series of different plastic films used as interfaces in order to understand if some might be more suitable for imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS We tested the optical properties of 11 different protective transparent films that are marketed in France with a transparency meter and a spectrophotometer. RESULTS Transmission, minimal diffusion, amount of gray, and contrast were obtained for each transparent film. Transmission ranged from 93.24% to 96.88% (mean 95.36; standard deviation SD 1.02), minimal diffusion from 88.28% to 123.87% (mean 101.04; standard deviation SD 10.02) and contrast from 11.01 to 15.88 (mean 13.93 and SD 1.3). For some films, the transmission was lower at lower wavelengths. CONCLUSION All tested films had excellent optical properties. However, some of them had better optical qualities and seemed more suitable for their use in dermatologic imaging.","Cinotti, Elisa; Campoli, Marco; Pataia, Giacomo; Ouerdane, Youcef; Thuret, Gilles; Gain, Philippe; Tognetti, Linda; Perrot, Jean Luc; Rubegni, Pietro",Skin research and technology : official journal of International Society for Bioengineering and the Skin (ISBS) [and] International Society for Digital Imaging of Skin (ISDIS) [and] International Society for Skin Imaging,457,17

Due to the urgency of this global pandemic, numerous therapeutic and vaccine trials have begun without customary safety and efficacy studies. Laboratory mice have been the stalwart of these types of studies; however, they do not support infection by SARS-CoV-2 due to the inability of its spike (S) protein to engage the mouse ortholog of its human entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). While hACE2 transgenic mice support infection and pathogenesis, these mice are currently limited in availability and are restricted to a single genetic background. Here we report the development of a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 based on adeno associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression of hACE2. These mice support viral replication and antibody production and exhibit pathologic findings found in COVID-19 patients as well as non-human primate models. Moreover, we show that type I interferons are unable to control SARS-CoV2 replication and drive pathologic responses. Thus, the hACE2-AAV mouse model enables rapid deployment for in-depth analysis following robust SARS-CoV-2 infection with authentic patient-derived virus in mice of diverse genetic backgrounds. This represents a much-needed platform for rapidly testing prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to combat COVID-19.

This report describes a novel technique for single-incision laparoscopic appendectomy. METHODS From August 2008 to October 2009, 69 consecutive patients with acute appendicitis underwent gasless single-incision laparoscopic appendectomy under epidural anesthesia at our department. An approximately 1.8-cm-long incision was made at McBurney's point. Once the abdominal wall was entered, an abdominal wall lifting device was employed in the right lower quadrant to lift up the abdominal wall to establish the operating space. Appendectomies were accomplished by use of three techniques: extracorporeally, combined extra- and intracorporeally, and intracorporeally. A drainage tube was inserted in right iliac fossa through the small incision when severe inflammation at the base of appendix or local peritonitis was present at time of operation. RESULTS Of the 69 patients, 66 underwent successful gasless single-incision laparoscopic appendectomy. In the remaining three patients the procedure was converted to open by extending the length of the incision at McBurney's point. Average operative time was 51 min (range 38-72 min). Abdominal cavity was drained in four patients. Patients resumed mobility within 24 h postoperatively. No complications occurred intraoperatively. Postoperative complication occurred in two patients: localized abscess in one, and wound infection in another; both were treated successfully with conservative management. CONCLUSIONS Appendectomy can be safely performed through gasless single-incision laparoscopic surgery. Further study is required to investigate any potential advantage of this method over conventional laparoscopic techniques.","Chen, Dawei; Shi, Huajun; Dong, Hao; Liu, Kaiquan; Ding, Kebao",Surgical endoscopy,457,1

STUDY DESIGN Catheter tip position for 319 infants was classified into superior vena cava (SVC, n=131), inferior vena cava (IVC, n=72), brachiocephalic (BC, n=59), midclavicular (MC, n=49) or iliac. Duration of catheter stay and complication profile was compared between central (SVC/IVC) vs non-central PICC, and between SVC vs IVC, SVC vs BC and SVC vs MC. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and regression models were used. RESULT Overall length of catheter stay was similar between central and non-central group. Non-central catheters (n=116) had higher complication rates (47 vs 29%; P=0.001), non-elective removals (45 vs 27%; P=0.002) and shorter time to complication (6.2 vs 11.4 days; P=0.043). This difference was primarily due to the complications encountered in MC group, which had the highest rate of infiltration (P<0.001) and mechanical complications while outcomes were similar among other subgroups. Interestingly, catheter survival probability was similar in all groups for first 4 days. Rate and types of blood stream infections were not related to catheter tip position. CONCLUSION Non-central PICCs are associated with higher rates of infiltration and mechanical complications when the tip is in MC region. BC catheters may have comparable outcomes to SVC in neonates. A careful risk-benefit analysis is warranted when MC catheters are used in neonates.","Jain, A; Deshpande, P; Shah, P",Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association,457,9

Recently, several laboratories have described a new class of rare influenza-neutralizing antibodies that target a conserved site in the haemagglutinin stem. Most of these antibodies use the heavy-chain variable region VH1-69 gene, and structural data demonstrate that they bind to the haemagglutinin stem through conserved heavy-chain complementarity determining region (HCDR) residues. However, the VH1-69 antibodies are highly mutated and are produced by some but not all individuals, suggesting that several somatic mutations may be required for their development. To address this, here we characterize 197 anti-stem antibodies from a single donor, reconstruct the developmental pathways of several VH1-69 clones and identify two key elements that are required for the initial development of most VH1-69 antibodies: a polymorphic germline-encoded phenylalanine at position 54 and a conserved tyrosine at position 98 in HCDR3. Strikingly, in most cases a single proline to alanine mutation at position 52a in HCDR2 is sufficient to confer high affinity binding to the selecting H1 antigen, consistent with rapid affinity maturation. Surprisingly, additional favourable mutations continue to accumulate, increasing the breadth of reactivity and making both the initial mutations and phenylalanine at position 54 functionally redundant. These results define VH1-69 allele polymorphism, rearrangement of the VDJ gene segments and single somatic mutations as the three requirements for generating broadly neutralizing VH1-69 antibodies and reveal an unexpected redundancy in the affinity maturation process.","Pappas, Leontios; Foglierini, Mathilde; Piccoli, Luca; Kallewaard, Nicole L; Turrini, Filippo; Silacci, Chiara; Fernandez-Rodriguez, Blanca; Agatic, Gloria; Giacchetto-Sasselli, Isabella; Pellicciotta, Gabriele; Sallusto, Federica; Zhu, Qing; Vicenzi, Elisa; Corti, Davide; Lanzavecchia, Antonio",Nature,457,31

The cervical lymph nodes are particularly important because they are the first drainage stations for key points of contact with the outside world (mouth/throat/nose/eyes/ears/respiratory system) - a critical aspect especially among children - and can represent an early clinical sign in their exposed position on a child's slim neck. Involvement of the lymph nodes in multiple conditions is accompanied by a correspondingly large number of available diagnostic procedures. In the interests of time, patient wellbeing and cost, a careful choice of these must be made to permit appropriate treatment. The basis of diagnostic decisions is a detailed anamnesis and clinical examination. Sonography also plays an important role in differential diagnosis of lymph node swelling in children and is useful in answering one of the critical diagnostic questions: is there a suspicion of malignancy? If so, full dissection of the most conspicuous lymph node may be necessary to obtain histological confirmation. Diagnosis and treatment of childhood cervical lymph node disorders present the attending pediatric and ENT physicians with some particular challenges. The spectrum of differential diagnoses and the varying degrees of clinical relevance - from banal infections to malignant diseases - demand a clear and considered approach to the child's individual clinical presentation.

But policy making is hindered by limited knowledge about why cycling prevalence and trends vary greatly between different geographic areas (e.g. in London (UK) <1% cycle to work in Harrow compared to>15 % in Hackney) and individuals (e.g. by age or gender). The role of cycle infrastructure investment in explaining part of these patterns and trends is also unknown. We linked individual-level data on 317,117 London commuters (including 11,199 cyclists) in the 2001 and 2011 UK census to relevant geographic data, including on area-level cycling infrastructure investment during the period. Whilst cycle commuting increased over time on average, concentration curves and indices demonstrated that in contrast with England as a whole, cycling in London shifted from being dominated by commuters with lower socioeconomic status to commuters with higher socioeconomic status. In our first set of regression analyses, we showed that observed differences and time trends in cycling prevalence were partially explained by area-level differences in topography, greenspace, footpaths and crime levels and by differences and changes in population structures. In the second, we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis which showed that expenditure on cycling infrastructure was associated with increased cycling at a marginal rate of £4915 per additional commuter cyclist, with some variation between groups: ethnic minorities were more responsive, and females, older people and those with lower socioeconomic status appeared less responsive. If planned increases in expenditure in England for the period 2020-25 were as cost-effective, and were sustained for the whole decade, our study suggests that commuter cycling prevalence could increase in England by 0.5 to 1.1 percentage points (this equates to a 16% to 34% increase in commuter cycling prevalence if compared to 2011 levels). More research is necessary to assess the impact on broader measures of cycling, active travel and overall physical activity, and to determine whether such expenditure constitutes good or equitable value for money.","Martin, Adam; Morciano, Marcello; Suhrcke, Marc",Economics and human biology,457,28

Previous studies have found that many patients had a procoagulant state and/or severe hypoxemia with relatively well-preserved lung mechanics. Mechanisms underlying the damage to vascular tissues are not well-elucidated yet. Histological data in COVID-19 patients are still limited and are mainly focused on post-mortem analysis. Given that the skin is affected by COVID-19 and the relative ease of its histological examination, we aimed to examine the histology of skin lesions in COVID-19 patients to better understand the disease's pathology. METHODS Five skin lesions from COVID-19 adult patients were selected for a deep histological tissue examination. RESULTS A strong vasculopathic reaction pattern based on prominent vascular endothelial and myointimal cell growth was identified. Endothelial cell distortion generated vascular lumen obliteration and striking erythrocyte and serum extravasation. Significant deposition of C4d and C3 throughout the vascular cell wall was also identified. A regenerative epidermal hyperplasia with tissue structure preservation was also observed. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 could comprise an obliterative microangiopathy consisting on endothelial and myointimal growth with complement activation. This mechanism, together with the increased vascular permeability identified, could contribute to obliteration of the vascular lumen and hemorrhage in COVID-19. Thus, anticoagulation by itself could not completely reverse vascular lumen obliteration, with consequent increased risk of hemorrhage. Findings of this study could contribute to a better understanding of physiopathological mechanisms underlying COVID-19 on living patients and could help further studies find potential targets for specific therapeutic interventions in severe cases.","Valtueña, Jara; Martínez-García, Gerardo; Ruiz-Sánchez, Daniel; Garayar-Cantero, María; Dueñas, Carlos; Hadi, Ali; Hadi, Suhail; Aguado-García, Ángel; Prieto de Paula, José M; Manchado-López, Pilar",International journal of dermatology,457,1

We applied the UK macroeconomic model 'COMPACT' to epidemiological data on previous UK influenza pandemics, and extrapolated a sensitivity analysis to cover more extreme disease scenarios. Analysis suggests that the economic impact of a repeat of the 1957 or 1968 pandemics, allowing for school closures, would be short-lived, constituting a loss of 3.35 and 0.58% of GDP in the first pandemic quarter and year, respectively. A more severe scenario (with more than 1% of the population dying) could yield impacts of 21 and 4.5%, respectively. The economic shockwave would be gravest when absenteeism (through school closures) increases beyond a few weeks, creating policy repercussions for influenza pandemic planning as the most severe economic impact is due to policies to contain the pandemic rather than the pandemic itself.Accounting for changes in consumption patterns made in an attempt to avoid infection worsens the potential impact. Our mild disease scenario then shows first quarter/first year reductions in GDP of 9.5/2.5%, compared with our severe scenario reductions of 29.5/6%.

Intraoperative lateral radiographs of the unaffected ankle are often used in clinical practice as a template for anatomic syndesmotic reduction because sagittal plane malreduction is common. However, there is little data to suggest fibular station, or the position of the fibula in the AP plane on the lateral radiograph, is symmetric side-to-side in patients. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES (1) Is the position of the fibula in the AP plane (fibular station) on lateral ankle radiographs symmetric in an individual? (2) Do the measurements used to judge the position of the fibula on lateral radiographs have good inter- and intraobserver reliability? METHODS Over the period from August 2016 to October 2018, we identified 478 patients who presented to an orthopaedic clinic with forefoot and midfoot complaints. Skeletally mature patients with acceptable bilateral lateral ankle radiographs, which are common radiographs obtained for new patients to clinic for any complaint, were included. Based on that, 52% (247 of 478 patients) were included with most (22%, 107 patients) excluded for poor lateral radiographs. The most common diagnosis in the patient cohort was midfoot OA (14%, 35 patients). The median (range) age of the included patients was 54 years (15 to 88), and 65% (159 of 247) of the patients were female. Fibular station, defined as the position of the fibula in the AP plane, and fibular length were measured using a digital ruler and goniometer on lateral radiographs. A paired t-test was used to determine if no difference in fibular station existed between the left and right ankles. With 247 paired-samples, with 80% power and an alpha level of 0.05, we could detect a difference between sides of 0.008 for the posterior ratio, 0.010 for the anterior ratio, and 0.012 for fibular length. Two readers, one fellowship-trained orthopaedic traumatologist and one PGY-4, measured 40 patients to determine the inter- and intraobserver reliability by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). RESULTS The posterior fibular station (mean right 0.147 [σ = 0.056], left 0.145 [σ = 0.054], difference = 0.03 [95% CI 0 to 0.06]; p = 0.59), anterior fibular station (right 0.294 [σ = 0.062], left 0.299 [σ = 0.061], difference = 0.04 [95% CI 0 to 0.08]; p = 0.20), and fibular length (right 0.521 [σ = 0.080], left 0.522 [σ = 0.078], difference = 0.05 [95% CI 0.01 to 0.09]; p = 0.87) ratios did not differ with the numbers available between ankles. Inter- and intraobserver reliability were excellent for the posterior ratio (ICC = 0.928 and ICC = 0.985, respectively) and the anterior ratio (ICC = 0.922 and ICC = 0.929, respectively) and moderate-to-good for the fibular length ratio (ICC = 0.732 and ICC = 0.887, respectively). CONCLUSION The use of lateral radiographs of the contralateral uninjured ankle appears to be a valid template for determining the position of the fibula in the sagittal plane. However, further prospective studies are required to determine the efficacy of this method in reducing the syndesmosis over other methods that exists.

Here, we review our experience with thoracoscopic thymectomy for juvenile myasthenia gravis (JMG) in the largest cohort to date. METHODS All cases of thymectomy for JMG in a single tertiary referral center between 2007 and 2018 were reviewed (N = 50). Patients underwent left thoracoscopic approach with extended dissection and without use of monopolar energy. Demographics, diagnostic criteria, and clinical classification, as well as surgical data were collected. Clinical status and medications were reviewed in follow-up. RESULTS The mean age at surgery was 10.5 ± 0.8 years. Ocular disease and generalized disease each comprised half of the cohort. No patients suffered complications or increased risk of morbidity or mortality with thymectomy. At any interval of follow-up through 3.5 years, 49.8% of patients were improved compared to their pre-operative presentation, and there was a significant trend towards decreased steroid use. CONCLUSION Thoracoscopic thymectomy is a safe treatment for juvenile myasthenia gravis in pediatric patients over a wide range of ages, body masses, and symptoms. Our experience adds evidence that pediatric patients likely benefit from thymectomy with improved clinical status and reduced medications.","Kim, Aimee G; Upah, Sydney A; Brandsema, John F; Yum, Sabrina W; Blinman, Thane A",Pediatric surgery international,457,31

We hypothesized that essential metabolites, glutamate, glucose, lactate, pyruvate and glycerol, are present and upregulated in healing Achilles tendons. We moreover hypothesized that adjuvant intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC), which increases blood flow, upregulates metabolite concentrations. Twenty patients with acute Achilles tendon rupture were recruited, operated, and included. The control group, 15 patients, received plaster cast immobilization, while five patients received adjuvant foot IPC beneath the plaster cast. At 2 weeks postoperatively, microdialysis of the healing and contralateral intact Achilles tendons was followed by quantification of metabolites. Healing compared to intact tendons of the controls exhibited significantly increased concentrations (mM) of glutamate (60 ± 14 vs 20 ± 11), lactate (1.15 ± 0.60 vs 0.64 ± 0.35), and pyruvate (81 ± 29 vs 35 ± 25, μM). Healing tendons of the IPC vs control group displayed higher levels of glutamate (84 ± 15 vs 62 ± 16) and glucose (3.44 ± 0.62 vs 2.62 ± 0.72); (P < 0.05) and trends toward higher concentrations of pyruvate, lactate, and glycerol (P < 0.10). The present study demonstrates that early Achilles tendon repair entails and upregulates local essential metabolites.

The first aim of this study was to report our experience on the management of neonates from mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection focusing on a 28-day follow-up since birth. The second aim is to assess how many data on neonatal outcomes of the first month of life are reported in literature, performing a systematic review and meta-analysis. STUDY DESIGN We report our experience based on routine management of neonates born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection and follow-up until 28 days of life. RESULTS In our experience at discharge, 1/48 (2.08%) of entrusted (mother refusing personal protective equipment) and none of separated presented positive nasopharyngeal swab (p = NS). All babies show good outcome at 28 days of life. The literature data show that the percentage of positive separated infants is significantly higher than the percentage of infants entrusted to positive mothers with appropriate control measures (13.63 vs. 2.4%; p = 0.0017). Meta-analysis of studies focused on follow-up showed a 2.94% higher risk of incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in entrusted newborns than in separated newborns (95% confidence interval: 0.39-22.25), but this was not significant (p = 0.30). CONCLUSION A vertical transmission in utero cannot be totally excluded. Since in newborns, the disease is often ambiguous with mild or absent symptoms, it is important to define the most efficient joint management for infants born to COVID-19 positive mothers, being aware that the risk of horizontal transmission from a positive mother, when protective measures are applied, does not seem to increase the risk of infection or to affect the development of newborns from birth to first four weeks of life, and encourages the benefits of breastfeeding and skin-to-skin practice.

However, epidemiologic data on the associations of zinc and genetic susceptibility with the risk of dyslexia are limited. We aimed to investigate whether genetic polymorphisms in GRIN2B genes modify the association between zinc levels and dyslexia risk. METHODS A case-control study of 240 dyslexic children and 230 healthy controls was conducted in Wuhan, Hangzhou and Jining city in China from April 2017 to April 2018. Zinc concentrations in urine samples were measured with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICPMS). Multiple imputation was used to impute missing values of covariates. We applied multivariable logistic regression models to evaluate the effect in the study. RESULTS After adjustment for potential confounders, we observed the associations of urinary zinc with dyslexia risk were modified by rs1805502 (Pinteraction = 0.048) in gene GRIN2B. About 2-fold increase in creatinine-corrected zinc levels was significantly related to a reduced risk of dyslexia [odds ratio (OR) = 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.29, 0.95 in rs1805502 mutation carriers]. CONCLUSIONS The associations between zinc levels and dyslexia risk were modified by polymorphism of rs1805502 in gene GRIN2B.","Liu, Qi; Zhu, Bing; Xue, Qi; Xie, Xinyan; Zhou, Yu; Zhu, Kaiheng; Wan, Zihao; Wu, Hao; Zhang, Jiajia; Song, Ranran",Environmental research,457,12

These food additives act as either preservatives or enhancers of palatability. Monosodium glutamate (MSG), a sodium salt of glutamic acid is a widely used food additive for enhancing taste. It gives the unique taste to the food called ""Umami"" or ""Savory taste"", which is different from four primary tastes namely, sweet, sour, salty, and bitter. The current experimental study was investigated by dose-related effects of MSG on adult Wistar rats using histological and histomorphometric techniques. METHODS Twenty-eight adult Wistar rats were divided into four groups i.e.; one control and three experimental groups. Rats were administered orally with different doses of MSG to the experimental groups and distilled water to the control groups consecutively for 45 days. At the end of the study, rats were sacrificed and tissues were collected for the examination. RESULTS Histomorphometric data of the nuclei diameter of hepatocytes showed significant variation between control and experimental groups. Less PAS-positive material found in a higher dose of MSG-induced rats in histochemical observation. CONCLUSIONS One of the challenges of the problem of animal experimental studies is the application of results to human dietary intake of MSG. Based on the dose-dependent findings of the current study; it is evident that the administration of MSG is hepatotoxic in adult Wistar rats.","Reddy, Anil Kumar; Ghoshal, Joy A K; Pk, Sankaran; Trivedi, Ganesh N; Ambareesha, Kondam",Journal of basic and clinical physiology and pharmacology,457,23

It has been found to act by preventing the polymerization of the protein called tubulin, thus inhibiting inflammasome activation, proinflammatory chemokines, and cellular adhesion molecules. Accumulating evidence suggests that some patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) suffer from ""cytokine storm"" syndrome. The ideal anti-inflammatory in this setting would be one that is readily available, cheap, orally administered, with a good safety profile, well-tolerated, and that prevents or modulates inflammasome activation. The researchers selected colchicine for their study. This paper is a review of the literature describing the effects of colchicine, which is a drug that is being increasingly used, especially when standard therapy fails.

METHOD An Observational multicenter-prospective study was conducted, under the aegis of the French and Swiss Societies of Phlebology (18 centers). Ninety patients were included in group 1, 617 in group 2 (mean age 80 years and 53 years; 69% women in both groups), representing 863 SV. Mean trunk diameters were similar in both groups (small SV: 6 mm; great SV: 7 mm). In group 1, comorbidities were more frequent, particularly cardiac insufficiency, diabetes, history of thrombosis, and CEAP clinical class was significantly higher. RESULTS EVLA was used in 86% of cases. Settings used were similar in both groups for each technique. Only 6% of TA was performed in an operating room for group 1 (14% group 2). Tumescent local anaesthesia (TLA) alone was used in 91% of cases in group 1 (85% group 2). The mean pain score was only 1.6 for the procedure itself (VASP 0-10; 10 max.) and 1.4 for the 10 days following the procedure. Side effects were few, but rate of paraesthesia was higher when general anaesthesia was used (11.8%) compared with TLA alone (2.2%). At three months, 100% of SV was occluded in group 1 (99.5% group 2), with high satisfaction score (9.3/10).

However, the use of a high-frequency electrotome under the microscope can significantly reduce bleeding and reduce the risk of surgery. Aim To explore the clinical significance of electrosurgical excision of the posterior longitudinal ligament in the cervical anterior approach under the microscope. Material and methods From December 2015 to December 2017, patients who underwent anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at our hospital were followed up. We enrolled 73 men and 50 women who were 30 to 74 years old (mean, 49.96 years). Among 67 patients in group A treated with a high-frequency electrosurgical knife under the microscope, 58 were followed up; among 73 patients in group B treated with a traditional cervical hook knife under the microscope, 65 were followed up. Clinical data, operative time, intraoperative bleeding volume, VAS score, and Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) improvement rate were retrospectively analyzed. Results There were significant differences in the mean operative time and intraoperative bleeding volume between the two groups (p < 0.05); however, no significant differences were found in the incidence of cerebrospinal fluid leakage, JOA improvement rate at 3 months postoperatively, and VAS score at 3 months postoperatively between the two groups (p > 0.05). Conclusions Electrosurgical resection of the posterior longitudinal ligament of the cervical vertebrae under the microscope can significantly reduce intraoperative bleeding and shorten the operative time and has obvious advantages compared with traditional methods.","Chen, Xiaogang; Wang, Guangye; Qin, Yuan-Tian; Li, Jin; Wang, Pu; Huang, Wenjun; Chen, Jie",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,457,26

Prior work has suggested that collateral thermal damage resulting from electrocautery use during skin flap development is a potential source of this complication. This report describes the case of a smoker with recurrent ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) who experienced significant unilateral skin necrosis following bilateral skin-sparing mastectomy while participating in a clinical trial examining mastectomy outcomes with two different surgical devices. This unexpected complication has implications for the choice of dissection devices in procedures requiring skin flap preservation. CASE PRESENTATION The patient was a 61-year-old Caucasian woman who was a smoker with recurrent DCIS of her right breast. As part of the clinical trial, each breast was randomized to either the standard of care treatment group (a scalpel and a traditional electrosurgical device) or treatment with a novel, low thermal injury dissection device, allowing for a direct, internally controlled comparison of surgical outcomes. Post-operative follow-up at six days was unremarkable for both operative sites. At 16 days post-surgery, the patient presented with a significant wound necrosis in the mastectomy site randomized to the control study group. Following debridement and closure, this site progressively healed over 10 weeks. The contralateral mastectomy, randomized to the alternative device, healed normally. CONCLUSION We hypothesize that thermal damage to the subcutaneous microvasculature during flap dissection may have contributed to this complication and that the use of a low thermal injury dissection device may be advantageous in select patients undergoing skin- and nipple-sparing mastectomy.","Fine, Richard E; Vose, Joshua G",Journal of medical case reports,457,16

One hundred five Angus × Hereford cow-calf pairs were evaluated as a randomized complete block that was replicated across 4 yr. Cows were approximately 39 d postpartum at the beginning of each yearly trial and were randomly allocated to either an untreated control (UTC) or an insecticide-treated (TRT) herd. Horn fly populations were monitored throughout each yearly replication and blood serum progesterone levels were used to estimate postpartum interval lengths and days to pregnancy. Initial body weights of cows were collected in May with final body weights and calf weaning weights acquired in October of each year. Monthly horn fly control ranged from 85.55 to 99.57% throughout the 4 yr. Cows within UTC herds maintained on average 530.10 ± 94.74 more (P = 0.0015) flies per animal than TRT. However, no differences were detected between treatment groups for any of the reproductive parameters evaluated (P > 0.05). Despite a lack of difference in the reproductive parameters measured, TRT cows gained more (P = 0.0492) weight throughout the fly seasons when compared to UTC cattle. Furthermore, calves paired with insecticide-treated cows tended (P = 0.0680) to wean 16.28 ± 8.04 kg heavier than calves paired with cows exposed to naturally occurring horn fly populations.","Smythe, Brandon G; Wise, Mark E; Cibils, Andres F; VanLeeuwen, Dawn; Summers, Adam F; Fletcher, Mike G; Scholljegerdes, Eric J",Journal of economic entomology,457,6

This retrospective study was aimed to explore the predictive value of the MHR for the late recurrence of AF after radiofrequency ablation. METHODS From April 2015 to October 2018, patients with paroxysmal AF who had undergone radiofrequency catheter ablation at Subei People's Hospital of Jiangsu Province were enrolled in our study. All the participants were observed until November 2019 after the procedure. During the postoperative follow up, the patients were categorized into the recurrence group and maintenance of sinus rhythm group based on who had experienced AF recurrence. RESULTS One hundred twenty-five patients were diagnosed with paroxysmal AF, with an average age of 61.2 ± 9.3 years. Forty-seven patients had developed late recurrence during a mean follow up of 25.1 ± 12.0 months. The AF recurrence event rates were significantly increased in the highest MHR tertile compared with those in the lowest MHR tertile (22.0% vs. 57.1%; P < 0.05). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, the preablation MHR (OR = 1.34; 95% CI = 1.12 ~ 1.60; P = 0.001) and left atrial diameter (LAD) (OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.08 ~ 1.35; P = 0.001) were independent risk factors predicting the recurrence of AF after radiofrequency ablation. Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) of the MHR was 0.712 (95% CI = 0.618 ~ 0.806; P = 0.000) and that of LAD was 0.739 (95% CI = 0.653 ~ 0.814; P = 0.000).

CONCLUSION An elevated preablation MHR was associated with an increased risk of the postoperative recurrence of AF. Additionally, the MHR independently predicted the late recurrence of paroxysmal AF after radiofrequency ablation, with the same predictive value as LAD.","Chen, She-An; Zhang, Man-Man; Zheng, Meifang; Liu, Fei; Sun, Lei; Bao, Zheng-Yu; Chen, Fu-Kun; Li, Hong-Xiao; Gu, Xiang",BMC cardiovascular disorders,457,8

The aim of this study is to provide a step-by-step description of the laparoscopic abdominopexy technique and present the first anatomical and functional results of the procedure. Methods This prospective cohort study included patients with apical and anterior vaginal prolapse who were subjected to laparoscopic abdominopexy. Before and after surgery, the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) scale, Overactive Bladder Questionnaire-Short Form (OABq-SF), and Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ-12) were used to evaluate the vaginal prolapse stage, storage, and sexual symptoms, respectively. The surgical technique is described step by step. Results Twenty patients were included with follow-up times between 6 and 25 months. The mean surgical time was 78.4 minutes. A statistically significant improvement was observed in the Aa (P ≤ 10-5), Ba (P ≤ 10-5), C (P = 5 × 10-5), D (P = .002) and tvl (P = .02) POP-Q points and in OABq-SF (22.2%; P = .02). Successful surgery was observed in 100% of patients for the apical compartment and 90% of patients for the anterior compartment.

A total of 71 Salmonella- and 21 Shigella-isolates producing ESBL(A) and/or AmpC, were received at Norwegian Institute of Public Health between 2005 and 2012. The 92 isolates were mixed with fecal specimens and tested on four ESBL screening media; ChromID ESBL (BioMèrieux), Brilliance ESBL (Oxoid), BLSE agar (AES Chemunex) and CHROMagar ESBL (CHROMagar). The BLSE agar is a biplate consisting of two different agars. Brilliance and CHROMagar are supposed to suppress growth of AmpC-producing bacteria while ChromID and BLSE agar are intended to detect both ESBL(A) and AmpC. RESULTS The total sensitivity (ESBL(A)+AmpC) with 95% confidence intervals after 24 hours of incubation were as follows: ChromID: 95% (90.4-99.6), Brilliance: 93% (87.6-98.4), BLSE agar (Drigalski): 99% (96.9-100), BLSE agar (MacConkey): 99% (96.9-100) and CHROMagar: 85% (77.5-92.5). The BLSE agar identified Salmonella and Shigella isolates as lactose-negative. The other agars based on chromogenic technology displayed Salmonella and Shigella flexneri isolates with colorless colonies (as expected). Shigella sonnei produced pink colonies, similar to the morphology described for E. coli. CONCLUSION All four agar media were reliable in screening fecal samples for ESBL(A)-producing Salmonella and Shigella. However, only ChromID and BLSE agar gave reliable detection of AmpC-producing isolates. Identification of different bacterial species based on colony colour alone was not accurate for any of the four agars.","Sturød, Kjersti; Dahle, Ulf R; Berg, Einar Sverre; Steinbakk, Martin; Wester, Astrid L",BMC microbiology,457,12

During the last decades, various biomolecules, including amino acids, have been successfully used as reducing and capping agents to synthesize multi-shaped gold nanostructures. A grand challenge in this field is to increase our ability to control the size and shape of gold nanostructures formed precisely by systematic synthetic approaches based on the understanding of the mechanism for structural determination. In this study, using glycine as the model amino acid and chloroaurate (AuCl4 -) ions as the precursor solution, we report the finding that the shape of the gold nanostructures synthesized showed a strong correlation with the speciation of gold complexes determined by the pH, precursor concentration and chloride concentration of the solvent system. The gold chloro-hydroxy speciation [AuClx(OH)4-x]- (with x = 0-4) influenced the shape of the gold nanostructures formed, with gold nanoplatelets, nanotriangles, nanokites and nanoribbons observed at x = 4, 3, 2 and 1, respectively, and spherical nanoparticles observed at x = 0. Glycine was found to play a role as a reducing agent, but no significant effect on the morphology was observed, indicating the dominance of gold chloro-hydroxy speciation in the structural formation. These results collectively provide synthetic considerations to systematically synthesize non-spherical to spherical biosynthesized gold nanostructures by controlling the speciation of [AuClx(OH)4-x]-.","Lee, Joun; Kim, Sanggon; Mubeen, Syed; Mulchandani, Ashok; Chen, Wilfred; Choa, Yongho; Myung, Nosang V",Nanotechnology,457,27

To characterize which occupations in the United States could likely work from home during a pandemic such as COVID-19.Methods. I merged 2018 US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) national employment and wage data with measures ranking the importance of computer use at work and the importance of working with or performing for the public from the BLS O*NET survey.Results. Approximately 25% (35.6 million) of US workers are employed in occupations (such as technology, administrative, financial, and engineering) that could be done from home; the remaining 75% work in occupations (including health care, manufacturing, retail, and food services) that are challenging to do from home.Conclusions. Most US workers are employed in occupations that cannot be done at home, putting 108.4 million workers at increased risk for adverse health outcomes related to working during a pandemic. These workers tend to be lower paid. The stress experienced by lower-income groups, coupled with job insecurity, could result in a large burden of mental health disorders in the United States in addition to increased cases of COVID-19 from workplace transmission.

Additionally, functional quantitative measurements of the leukemic BMV during chemotherapy and radiotherapy are limited largely due to a lack of high-resolution imaging techniques available preclinically. This study develops a murine model using compartmental modeling for quantitative multiphoton microscopy (QMPM) to characterize the malignant BMV before and during treatment. METHODS Using QMPM, live time-lapsed images of dextran leakage from the local BMV to the surrounding bone marrow of mice bearing acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were taken, and fit to a two-compartment model to measure the transfer rate (Ktrans), fractional extracellular extravascular space (νec), and vascular permeability parameters as well as functional single-vessel characteristics. In response to leukemia-induced BMV alterations, the effects of 2-4Gy low-dose radiotherapy (LDRT) on the BMV, drug delivery, and mouse survival were assessed post-treatment to determine if neo-adjuvant LDRT prior to chemotherapy improves treatment outcome. RESULTS Mice bearing ALL had significantly altered Ktrans, increased νec, and increased permeability compared to healthy mice. Angiogenesis, decreased single-vessel perfusion and decreased vessel diameter were observed. BMV alterations resulted in disease-dependent reductions in cellular uptake of Hoechst dye. LDRT to mice bearing ALL dilated BMV, increased single-vessel perfusion, and increased daunorubicin uptake by ALL cells. Consequently, LDRT administered to mice before receiving Nilotinib significantly increased survival compared to mice receiving LDRT after Nilotinib, demonstrating the importance of LDRT conditioning before therapeutic administration. CONCLUSION Developed QMPM enables single-platform assessments of the pharmacokinetics of fluorescent agents and characterization of the BMV. Initial results suggest BMV alterations after neo-adjuvant LDRT may contribute to enhanced drug delivery and increased treatment efficacy for ALL. Developed QMPM enables observations of the BMV for use in ALL treatment optimization.","Brooks, Jamison; Kumar, Bijender; Zuro, Darren M; Raybuck, Jonathon D; Madabushi, Srideshikan Sargur; Vishwasrao, Paresh; Parra, Liliana Echavarria; Kortylewski, Marcin; Armstrong, Brian; Froelich, Jerry; Hui, Susanta K","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",457,9

Natural killer (NK) cells, the major cells of the innate immune system, are critical for the antitumor and antiviral defenses; however, in certain cases, they may be the main culprits in the pathogenesis of some NK-related conditions such as autoimmunities and hematological malignancies. On the other hand, these cells seem to be the major responders in beneficial phenomena like graft versus leukemia. Substantial data suggest that MSCs can variably affect NK cells and can be affected by these cells. Accordingly, acquiring a profound understanding of the crosstalk between MSCs and NK cells and the involved mechanisms seems to be a necessity to develop therapeutic approaches based on such interactions. Therefore, in this study, we made a thorough review of the existing literature on the interactions between MSCs and NK cells with a focus on the underlying mechanisms. The current knowledge herein suggests that MSCs possess a great potential to be used as tools for therapeutic targeting of NK cells in disease context and that preconditioning of MSCs, as well as their genetic manipulation before administration, may provide a wider variety of options in terms of eliciting more specific and desirable therapeutic outcomes. Nevertheless, our knowledge regarding the effects of MSCs on NK cells is still in its infancy, and further studies with well-defined conditions are warranted herein.","Moloudizargari, Milad; Govahi, Ali; Fallah, Marjan; Rezvanfar, Mohammad A; Asghari, Mohammad H; Abdollahi, Mohammad",Journal of cellular physiology,457,1

METHODS A literature search was conducted using multiple science databases: PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library, on 10 March 2021. RCT and Cohort studies in English or Scandinavian languages were included. Exposure variables included diet, lifestyle, meal patterns or physical activity. Studies using dietary supplements as exposure variables were excluded. Outcome variables included were DNA methylation, microRNA or histone changes in placenta, cord blood or offspring. Two independent authors screened, read and extracted data from the included papers. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB2) and The Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) Cohort Study Checklist were used to assess risk of bias in the included studies. A qualitative approach was employed due to heterogeneity of exposures and results of the studies. RESULTS 16 studies and 3617 participants were included in the final analysis. The exposure variables included physical activity, carbohydrate, low glycemic index diet, added sugar, fat, Mediterranean diet and pro-inflammatory diet. The outcome variables identified were differences in DNA methylation and microRNA. Most studies described epigenetic changes in either placenta or cord blood. Genes reported to be methylated were GR, HSD2, IGF-2, PLAG1, MEG-3, H19 and RXRA. However, not all studies found epigenetic changes strong enough to pass multiple testing, and the study quality varied. CONCLUSION Despite the variable quality of the included studies, the results in this review suggest that there may be an association between the mother's lifestyle, diet and level of physical activity during pregnancy and epigenetic changes in the offspring.","Rasmussen, Louise; Knorr, Sine; Antoniussen, Christian Skødt; Bruun, Jens Meldgaard; Ovesen, Per Glud; Fuglsang, Jens; Kampmann, Ulla",Nutrients,457,1

METHODS All patients with SILS or conventional sigmoidectomy for diverticulitis of a single visceral surgery department were subject to a matched-pair analysis stratified by age, sex, body mass index, previous abdominal surgery, and the stage of DD. RESULTS Fifty-five pairs were included. In total, 84/110 (76%) had complicated stages of DD. ASA stages were higher in the laparotomy group; the proportion of elective operations was similar (SILS 78%, open: 71%). In the SILS group, length of hospital stay (LoS; 10.2 vs. 16.7 days) and duration of intensive or intermediate care (IMC; 1.8 vs. 3.7 days) were shorter, blood transfusions were reduced (0.1 vs. 0.4 units) and less patients received opioids postoperatively (75 vs. 98%).

Previous studies in our laboratory have identified matrix metalloprotease-3 (MMP3) as an important mediator of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ARDS, particularly in the exudative phase. Our studies have also reported elevated plasma MMP3 activity levels in the ARDS patients and that inhibition of MMP3 can reduce the severity of LPS-induced ARDS in mice.

Our aim was to evaluate test characteristics of abdominal CT compared to upper gastrointestinal series (UGI) and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for diagnosing GGF using surgery as a gold standard. METHODS Retrospective review of RYGB patients who underwent abdominal CT with oral contrast within 1 year. Demographics, weight parameters, and symptoms were collected. Surgery within 1 year of the diagnostic tests was included as the gold standard comparison. Primary outcomes included CT sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and diagnostic accuracy (DA) for GGF. RESULTS One hundred thirty-seven patients were included, where 42 (30.1%) had positive CT and 95 (69.3%) had negative CT for GGF. Compared to surgical confirmation, CT abdomen with PO contrast had sensitivity of 73.1% (59-84.4), specificity of 95.2% (88.3-98.7), PPV 90.5% (77.4-97.3), NPV of 85.1% (76.3-91.2), and DA 89.7%.

However, it remains a challenge to achieve complete TME with clear circumferential resections margin (CRM) with the conventional transabdominal approach, particularly in mid and low rectal tumours. Transanal TME (TaTME) was developed to improve oncological and functional outcomes of patients with mid and low rectal cancer. METHODS An international, multicentre, superiority, randomised trial was designed to compare TaTME and conventional laparoscopic TME as the surgical treatment of mid and low rectal carcinomas. The primary endpoint is involved CRM. Secondary endpoints include completeness of mesorectum, residual mesorectum, morbidity and mortality, local recurrence, disease-free and overall survival, percentage of sphincter-saving procedures, functional outcome and quality of life. A Quality Assurance Protocol including centralised MRI review, histopathology re-evaluation, standardisation of surgical techniques, and monitoring and assessment of surgical quality will be conducted.

That a dissenting faction of conservative judges seeks to ignore the prevailing approach presents a potentially dangerous path for Second Amendment jurisprudence. This article draws from certain historical gun laws to illustrate the difficult legwork that analogies must do under a purely historical test. It uses the advent of ghost guns as a case study to offer guidance for judges in their rulemaking practices regarding Second Amendment cases.","Talbot, Thaddeus; Skaggs, Adam","The Journal of law, medicine & ethics : a journal of the American Society of Law, Medicine & Ethics",457,4

He was found to have portal vein thrombosis, with extensive hypercoagulability workup performed. It was determined that the aetiology of thrombus was secondary to acute cytomegalovirus infection. The patient was started on anticoagulation therapy, with later clot resolution demonstrated on abdominal Doppler ultrasound and abdominal CT scan. Given the atypical presentation of this common virus, we performed a literature review of cytomegalovirus-associated portal vein thrombosis in healthy individuals; we found that most patients present with non-specific symptoms of fever and abdominal pain in the setting of a viral prodrome. This case and literature review suggest physicians must consider cytomegalovirus-associated portal vein thrombosis as a potential diagnosis when patients present with abdominal pain and viral symptoms.

The aim of the study was to evaluate clinical outcomes following the use of Permacol™ porcine collagen surgical implant in complex abdominal wall repair. METHODS This subset analysis of seven European sites from a multicentre retrospective study included patients undergoing open or laparoscopic surgery and treated with Permacol™ surgical implant. Inguinal, parastomal, diaphragmatic, perineal, and hiatal repairs were excluded. Only patients with at least 12 months of follow-up after surgery were included. RESULTS A total of 109 patients (56 males and 53 females) were included. Patients had a median of two comorbidities (range 0-6). Thirty-three per cent of patients were treated for recurrent hernia. All but one case used an open approach. Sixty-six per cent were Center for Disease Control wound class II-IV at the time of surgery. Fascial closure was achieved in 69%. Median follow-up length was 720 days (range 368-2857). Recurrence rates at 1 and 2 years were 9.2 and 18.3 %, respectively, and were higher in cases without fascial closure. One-year recurrence was higher following use of an onlay technique (P = 0.025). In a multivariate analysis, among 16 comorbidities examined only fascial closure significantly impacted 1-year recurrence (P = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS Data from this large retrospective multicentre European study strongly suggest the use of Permacol™ porcine collagen surgical implant to be safe and effective for complex abdominal wall repair. The recurrence rate was impacted by fascial closure.","Giordano, P; Pullan, R D; Ystgaard, B; Gossetti, F; Bradburn, M; McKinley, A J; Smart, N J; Daniels, I R",Techniques in coloproctology,457,33

Online teaching has grown rapidly under lockdown. Yet the online approach for assessment presents a number of challenges, particularly when evaluating clinical competencies. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility, acceptability, reliability and validity of an online Virtual Clinical Encounter Examination (VICEE) to assess non-psychomotor competencies (non-procedure or manual skills) of medical students. METHOD Sixty-one final year medical students took the VICEE as part of the final summative examination. A panel of faculty experts developed the exam cases and competencies. They administered the test online via real-time interaction with artificial intelligence (AI) based virtual patients, along with faculty and IT support. RESULTS Student and faculty surveys demonstrated satisfaction with the experience. Confirmatory factor analysis supported convergent validity of VICEE with Direct Observation Clinical Encounter Examination (DOCEE), a previously validated clinical examination. The observed sensitivity was 81.8%, specificity 64.1% and likelihood ratio 12.6, supporting the ability of VICEE to diagnose 'clinical incompetence' among students. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that online AI-based virtual patient high fidelity simulation may be used as an alternative tool to assess some aspects of non-psychometric competencies.","Hamdy, Hossam; Sreedharan, Jayadevan; Rotgans, Jerome I; Zary, Nabil; Bahous, Sola Aoun; Venkatramana, Manda; AbdelFattah Elzayat, Elsayed; Lamba, Pankaj; Sebastian, Suraj K; Momen, Noha Kamal Abdel",Medical teacher,457,1

Disease mechanisms, including the role and interaction of individual metabolic pathways, remain unclear. As hypoxia is an acute condition, aerobic energy metabolism is central to global metabolic pathways, and these metabolites are detectable using 1H NMR spectroscopy, we hypothesized that characterizing the NMR-derived umbilical cord serum metabolome would offer insight into the consequences of PA that lead to HIE. Fifty-nine at-risk infants were enrolled, together with 1:1 matched healthy controls, and stratified by disease severity (n=25, HIE; n=34, non-HIE PA). Eighteen of 37 reproducibly detectable metabolites were significantly altered between study groups. Acetone, 3-hydroxybutyrate, succinate, and glycerol were significantly differentially altered in severe HIE. Multivariate data analysis revealed a metabolite profile associated with both asphyxia and HIE. Multiple-linear regression modeling using 4 metabolites (3-hydroxybutyrate, glycerol, O-phosphocholine, and succinate) predicted HIE severity with an adjusted R2 of 0.4. Altered ketones suggest that systemic metabolism may play a critical role in preventing neurological injury, while altered succinate provides a possible explanation for hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF-1α) stabilization in HI injury.","Reinke, Stacey N; Walsh, Brian H; Boylan, Geraldine B; Sykes, Brian D; Kenny, Louise C; Murray, Deirdre M; Broadhurst, David I",Journal of proteome research,457,19

DESIGN This descriptive study was based on a convenience sample of registered nurses working in four hospitals throughout Israel from internal medicine, surgical, emergency, and intensive care units. METHODS A questionnaire designed by the investigators was administered to registered nurses while on duty. The questionnaire consisted of three sections: personal characteristics, perceived level of personal threat from five situations (caring for a patient with a dangerous infection, terror attack, war, radiation or chemical disaster, or natural disaster), and perceived personal and peer willingness to work under these threats. FINDINGS A convenience sample of 249 registered nurses from four hospitals responded. The highest level of perceived threat was a natural disaster (earthquake; M = 2.15, SD = 0.9). Terror (M = 0.83, SD = 0.6) and war (M = 1.01, SD = 0.6) received the lowest mean perceived threat scores. Most respondents were not willing to work during a natural disaster but were willing to care for patients with dangerous infections and during times of war. Weak positive statistically significant correlations were found between the level of perceived threat and willingness to work for all of the threats, except for terror (Spearman rank correlation = .16-.35). CONCLUSIONS Local culture, perceptions of the level of threat, and perceived peer responsiveness are associated with registered nurses' willingness to work under threat. CLINICAL RELEVANCE When faced with a threat to personal safety or security, many registered nurses might not be willing to work as usual. What is perceived as threatening is influenced by the local culture and environment. Therefore, managers should be aware of potential cultural and peer influences on this possible conflict of values.","Ganz, Freda DeKeyser; Margalith, Ilana; Benbenishty, Julie; Hirschfeld, Miriam; Wagner, Nurit; Toren, Orly",Journal of nursing scholarship : an official publication of Sigma Theta Tau International Honor Society of Nursing,457,29

Method The conceptual model and framework categorize informatics solutions that could be used by stakeholders (e.g., government, academic institutions, healthcare providers and payers, life science companies, employers, citizens) to address public health challenges across the prepare, respond, and recover phases of a pandemic, building on existing models for public health operations and response. Results Mapping existing solutions, technology assets, and ideas to the framework helped identify public health informatics solution requirements and gaps in responding to COVID-19 in areas such as applied science, epidemiology, communications, and business continuity. Two examples of technologies used in COVID-19 illustrate novel applications of informatics encompassed by the framework. First, we examine a hub from The Weather Channel, which provides COVID-19 data via interactive maps, trend graphs, and details on case data to individuals and businesses. Second, we examine IBM Watson Assistant for Citizens, an AI-powered virtual agent implemented by healthcare providers and payers, government agencies, and employers to provide information about COVID-19 via digital and telephone-based interaction. Discussion Early results from these novel informatics solutions have been positive, showing high levels of engagement and added value across stakeholders. Conclusion The framework supports development, application, and evaluation of informatics approaches and technologies in support of public health preparedness, response, and recovery during a pandemic.

The device is implanted in the aneurysm sac at the level of the neck. We report our initial experience in a series of patients treated with this device. METHODS This retrospective study was approved by the authors' ethics committees. 18 patients with 19 unruptured wide neck bifurcation intracranial aneurysms (IA) were treated by pCONus placement and coiling. Technical issues, immediate post treatment angiographic findings, and clinical and imaging follow-up were assessed. RESULTS Embolization was successful in all patients. There were 11 women and 7 men with a mean age of 60 years. Median aneurysm size was 9 mm (range 5.5-25 mm). The device was precisely placed and detached in all cases, allowing for subsequent coiling. Two patients experienced a symptomatic complication, one of which, a thromboembolism, was related to the use of the pCONus. This patient had a slight hand paresis. 16 patients had a normal neurological examination at discharge. Immediate anatomical results were 13 complete occlusions, 2 neck remnants, and 4 incomplete occlusions. Imaging follow-up was obtained in 12 patients (mean 9.5 months, range 2-24 months) and showed 9 stable occlusions and 3 recanalizations, of which 2 were retreated. CONCLUSIONS In this initial series of patients, endovascular treatment of wide neck bifurcation IAs with the pCONus was feasible, with acceptable clinical and anatomical outcomes.

Initial experiments performed more than 30 years ago found that global disruption of RNA led to visible rearrangements of nuclear organization. Yet, this idea remained controversial for many years, in large part because it was unclear what specific RNAs might be involved, and which specific nuclear structures might be dependent on RNA. Over the past few years, the contributions of RNA to organizing nuclear structures have become clearer with the discovery that many nuclear bodies are enriched for specific noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs); in specific cases, ncRNAs have been shown to be essential for establishment and maintenance of these nuclear structures. More recently, many different ncRNAs have been shown to play critical roles in initiating the three-dimensional (3D) spatial organization of DNA, RNA, and protein molecules in the nucleus. These examples, combined with global imaging and genomic experiments, have begun to paint a picture of a broader role for RNA in nuclear organization and to uncover a unifying mechanism that may explain why RNA is a uniquely suited molecule for this role. In this review, we provide an overview of the history of RNA and nuclear structure and discuss key examples of RNA-mediated bodies, the global roles of ncRNAs in shaping nuclear structure, and emerging insights into mechanisms of RNA-mediated nuclear organization.","Quinodoz, Sofia A; Guttman, Mitchell",Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in biology,457,1

PA acts as a selective Ca++-dependent K-channels (Maxi-K, BK) antagonist in brain, causing motor system dysfunctions including tremors and seizures. However, its molecular mechanism at the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is still ambiguous. The Mediterranean diet key ingredient extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) provides a variety of minor bioactive phenolics. (+)-Pinoresinol (PN) and (+)-1-acetoxypinoresinol (AC) are naturally occurring lignans in EVOO with diverse biological activities. AC exclusively occurs in EVOO unlike PN, which occur in several plants. Results suggest that PA neurotoxicity molecular mechanism is mediated, in part, through distortion of JAK/STAT pathway. PA selectively activated STAT1 pathway, independently of IFN-γ pathway, in vitro in Schwann cells and in vivo in Swiss albino mice sciatic nerves. Preliminary in vitro screening of EVOO phenolic compounds library for ability to reverse PA toxicity on Schwann cells revealed PN and AC as potential hits. In a Swiss albino mouse model, AC significantly minimized the fatality after intra-peritoneal administration of PA fatal doses and normalized most biochemical factors by modulating the STAT1 expression. The olive lignan AC is a novel lead that can prevent the neurotoxicity of food-contaminating tremorgenic indole alkaloid mycotoxins.","Qusa, Mohammed; Abdelwahed, Khaldoun S; Meyer, Sharon; El Sayed, Khalid A",ACS chemical neuroscience,457,1

Increased presenteeism, decreased absenteeism, and low uptake of the influenza vaccine can contribute to the spread of influenza among HCP in healthcare settings. We used a mixed methods approach to investigate attitudes and behaviors of HCP in Israel towards influenza vaccination, presenteeism, and absenteeism. METHODS The study took place over three influenza seasons (2016-2017, 2017-2018, 2018-2019) at the largest hospital in southern Israel. We administered a Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) questionnaire and conducted semi-structured interviews with HCP who had been recently ill with respiratory symptoms. The KAP questionnaire included closed-ended questions about attitudes and behaviors regarding influenza, working while sick, and influenza vaccination. The interviews investigated HCP's perceptions of influenza infection and attitudes about absenteeism, presenteeism, and the influenza vaccine. RESULTS We conducted 74 semi-structured interviews over three influenza seasons. Four HCP were interviewed twice, in separate seasons for different illness episodes. The 70 individuals interviewed included 16 physicians, 45 nurses or technicians, and 9 administrative staff. The median age was 42.5 years (range: 25-60), and most (79%) were female. Half (50%) got vaccinated against influenza before their illness episode. In interviews, most HCP said they come to work while sick (presenteeism) due to a strong personal work ethic and an institutional culture that discourages taking sick leave (absenteeism). HCP expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine as well as concern that the influenza vaccine causes severe illness. DISCUSSION Over three influenza seasons in Israel, HCP cited a number of reasons for working while sick, and doubted the usefulness of influenza vaccine. Addressing reasons for presenteeism and vaccine hesitancy among HCP is crucial to protect HCP and patients from influenza virus infection and other viral respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19.","Gur-Arie, Rachel; Katz, Mark A; Hirsch, Avital; Greenberg, David; Malosh, Ryan; Newes-Adeyi, Gabriella; Davidovitch, Nadav; Rosenthal, Anat",Vaccine,457,1

In patients with arch vessel involvement, extensive surgical repairs often necessitate prolonged use of CPB and results in extensive inflammatory responses. Cytokines and chemokines released during CPB contribute to the progression of SIRS, increase perioperative complications, and negatively impact surgical outcomes. A cytokine adsorber (HA380) is expected to reduce the level of cytokines during CPB, which may decrease both intraoperative and postoperative inflammation. The purpose of this study is to investigate if HA380 is able to reduce the levels of inflammatory cytokines and decrease perioperative complications in ATAAD patients undergoing CPB and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA). METHODS This study is a single-center, randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial. The study aims to recruit 88 patients with ATAAD and aortic arch involvement who will undergo CPB and DHCA to repair the dissected aorta. Patients will be randomized equally into the CPB/DHCA only group (control group) and the CPB/DHCA + HA380 hemoperfusion group (intervention group), with 44 patients each. Patients in the control group will undergo CPB and DHCA only, while patients in the intervention group will undergo continuous hemoperfusion with HA380, in addition to CPB and DHCA. The primary outcome is a composite of major perioperative complications. The secondary outcomes include related inflammatory markers, coagulation parameters, and minor perioperative complications. To comprehensively evaluate the effect of hemoperfusion on the perioperative outcomes, we will also determine if there are differences in perioperative all-cause mortality, length of ICU stay, and total hospitalization costs. DISCUSSION In the current trial, hemoperfusion will be applied in patients undergoing CPB and DHCA for repair of the aorta involving the aortic arch. This trial aims to test the safety and efficacy of our hemoperfusion device (HA380) in such settings. Upon completion of the trial, we will determine if HA380 is effective in reducing perioperative proinflammatory cytokine levels. Further, we will also verify if reduction in the proinflammatory cytokine levels, if present, translates to improvement in patient outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04007484 .

In Japan, although there were no reported PED cases from 2007 to 2012, a large-scale PED outbreak started in 2013, causing severe economic losses. Although several PEDV studies have been conducted in Japan, more PEDV isolates and sequence information are needed to understand the molecular biology and epidemiology of PEDV. Here, we isolated seven Japanese PEDV strains from intestinal tissue samples collected in 2014 and determined the spike gene sequences of 13 Japanese PEDV strains, including the above seven isolates. Phylogenetic analysis shows that all of the strains are genetically distinct from classical Japanese PEDV strains isolated prior to 2013 and can be classified into two different genotypes: 12 strains belong to the North American clade composed of recent highly pathogenic PEDV strains, and the remaining one strain belongs to the so-called insertion deletion (INDEL) clade. These data suggest multiple PEDV invasions from abroad to Japan. Notably, compared to classical Japanese strains, all of the recent Japanese strains have two amino acid substitutions in a known neutralizing epitope. In addition, one of the strains acquired an additional mutation in another neutralizing epitope that is highly conserved among PEDVs, including the classical and recent isolates. Our isolates and findings will be useful for future investigations aimed at understanding, controlling, and preventing PED.","Horie, Masayuki; Kabemura, Mitsue; Masatani, Tatsunori; Matsuu, Aya; Ozawa, Makoto",Archives of virology,457,1

Many factors influence aerosol delivery and recommendations exist, but little is known about knowledge translation into clinical practice. METHODS Two-week cross-sectional study to assess the prevalence of aerosol therapy in 81 intensive and intermediate care units in 22 countries. All aerosols delivered to patients breathing spontaneously, ventilated invasively or noninvasively (NIV) were recorded, and drugs, devices, ventilator settings, circuit set-up, humidification and side effects were noted. RESULTS A total of 9714 aerosols were administered to 678 of the 2808 admitted patients (24 %, CI95 22-26 %), whereas only 271 patients (10 %) were taking inhaled medication before admission. There were large variations among centers, from 0 to 57 %. Among intubated patients 22 % (n = 262) received aerosols, and 50 % (n = 149) of patients undergoing NIV, predominantly (75 %) inbetween NIV sessions. Bronchodilators (n = 7960) and corticosteroids (n = 1233) were the most frequently delivered drugs (88 % overall), predominantly but not exclusively (49 %) administered to patients with chronic airway disease. An anti-infectious drug was aerosolized 509 times (5 % of all aerosols) for nosocomial infections.

Since the release of the guidelines, very few studies have examined the associations of adherence to the 24-Hour Guidelines with health outcomes-and none focus on psychosocial health. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the associations of meeting the 24-Hour Guidelines and their behaviour-specific recommendations with psychosocial health among Canadian children and youth. DATA AND METHODS This cross-sectional study included 4,250 children and youth aged 5 to 17 years with valid accelerometer data. The study data were collected from 2009 to 2015 with the Canadian Health Measures Survey and pooled. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was measured using accelerometers; screen time, sleep duration and measures of psychosocial health were self- or proxy-reported. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the associations of meeting individual or different combined recommendations from the 24-Hour Guidelines with psychosocial health. RESULTS There was low overall adherence to all three 24-Hour Guidelines recommendations, especially among youth (children: 13.9%, youth: 4.8%). Meeting two or more of the recommendations was associated with higher odds of positive psychosocial health among youth (odds ratio [OR] = 3.10; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17-8.19). Sleep duration and screen time were strongly associated with social behaviour and psychosocial health among Canadian youth. DISCUSSION Adherence to the 24-Hour Guidelines was significantly associated with better psychosocial health among Canadian youth.","Bang, Felix; Roberts, Karen C; Chaput, Jean-Philippe; Goldfield, Gary S; Prince, Stephanie A",Health reports,457,1

Selected search terms included ""basicervical,"" ""basi cervical,"" ""AO/OTA type 31-B,"" ""femoral neck fracture"" AND ""bone nails,"" ""bone screws,"" ""fracture fixation,"" ""internal fixation,"" ""arthroplasty,"" ""cephalomedullary,"" ""sliding hip screw,"" ""ORIF,"" and ""treatment outcome."" We included studies that assessed outcomes of basicervical fracture fixation using open reduction internal fixation or arthroplasty. Two authors extracted the following data from each paper: study design, country, cohort year, definition of basicervical, intervention type, sample size, patient demographics, follow-up length, percent of fractures that required revision, and the percent of implants that failed. RESULTS Sixteen articles encompassing 910 patients were included. The main outcome was the percent of implants that required revision. The total revision rates were 8% (8 studies, 157 patients, range 0%-55%) for cephalomedullary nails, 7% (10 studies, 584 patients, range 0%-18%) for sliding hip screws, 23% (3 studies, 40 patients, range 16%-50%) for cannulated screws, 0% (1 study, 6 patients) for total hip arthroplasty, and 8% (2 studies, 13 patients, range 0%-11%) for hemiarthroplasty. CONCLUSION Management of basicervical fractures with SHS and CMN produces similar failure and re-operation rates. Limited evidence is available on the use of cannulated screws and arthroplasty, but available studies suggest that cannulated screws have an unacceptable revision rate (23%) while arthroplasty may be acceptable. Future studies examining the comparative efficacy of various fixation methods would benefit from strict definition of fracture type as well as consistent reporting of functional outcomes, re-operation rates, and mortality.","Dekhne, Mihir S; Thomas, Hannah M; Haider, Thomas; Mortensen, Sharri; Rodriguez, Edward K; Weaver, Michael J; von Keudell, Arvind",Journal of orthopaedic surgery,457,1

In the United States, many medical schools, the American Medical Association, and the National Academy of Sciences have published calls for physicians and physicians-in-training to develop a basic knowledge of the science of climate change and an awareness of the associated health risks. The authors--all medical students and educators--argue for the expeditious redesign of medical school curricula to teach students to recognize, diagnose, and treat the many health conditions exacerbated by climate change as well as understanding public health issues. In this Invited Commentary, the authors briefly review the health impacts of climate change, examine current climate change course offerings and proposals, and describe the rationale for promptly and comprehensively including climate science education in medical school curricula. Efforts in training physicians now will benefit those physicians' communities, whose health will be impacted by a period of remarkable climate change. The bottom line is that the health effects of climate reality cannot be ignored, and people everywhere must adapt as quickly as possible.","Goshua, Anna; Gomez, Jason; Erny, Barbary; Burke, Marshall; Luby, Stephen; Sokolow, Susanne; LaBeaud, A Desiree; Auerbach, Paul; Gisondi, Michael A; Nadeau, Kari",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,457,25

Here, we identify the RNA binding protein, poly(C)-binding protein 1 (PCBP1) as an intracellular immune checkpoint that is up-regulated in activated T cells to prevent conversion of effector T (Teff) cells into regulatory T (Treg) cells, by restricting the expression of Teff cell-intrinsic Treg commitment programs. This was critical for stabilizing Teff cell functions and subverting immune-suppressive signals. T cell-specific deletion of Pcbp1 favored Treg cell differentiation, enlisted multiple inhibitory immune checkpoint molecules including PD-1, TIGIT, and VISTA on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and blunted antitumor immunity. Our results demonstrate a critical role for PCBP1 as an intracellular immune checkpoint for maintaining Teff cell functions in cancer immunity.","Ansa-Addo, Ephraim A; Huang, Huai-Cheng; Riesenberg, Brian; Iamsawat, Supinya; Borucki, Davis; Nelson, Michelle H; Nam, Jin Hyun; Chung, Dongjun; Paulos, Chrystal M; Liu, Bei; Yu, Xue-Zhong; Philpott, Caroline; Howe, Philip H; Li, Zihai",Science advances,457,1

Here, using a 5-year dataset of eukaryotic plankton DNA metabarcoding, we assess changes in biodiversity and net community production in this region. Our results show that sea-ice extent is a dominant factor influencing eukaryotic plankton community composition, biodiversity, and net community production. Species richness and evenness decline with an increase in sea surface temperature (SST). In regions with low SST and shallow mixed layers, the community was dominated by a diverse assemblage of diatoms and dinoflagellates. Conversely, less diverse plankton assemblages were observed in waters with higher SST and/or deep mixed layers when sea ice extent was lower. A genetic programming machine-learning model explained up to 80% of the net community production variability at the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Among the biological explanatory variables, the sea-ice environment associated plankton assemblage is the best predictor of net community production. We conclude that eukaryotic plankton diversity and carbon cycling at the Western Antarctic Peninsula are strongly linked to sea-ice conditions.","Lin, Yajuan; Moreno, Carly; Marchetti, Adrian; Ducklow, Hugh; Schofield, Oscar; Delage, Erwan; Meredith, Michael; Li, Zuchuan; Eveillard, Damien; Chaffron, Samuel; Cassar, Nicolas",Nature communications,457,16

STUDY DESIGN We conducted a longitudinal observational study, utilising convenience sampling to examine illness-related perception in the immediate and medium-term stages of the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the UK. METHODS Weekly questionnaires assessed our primary measure, illness-related perception, using The Health Anxiety Inventory. Other psychological measures included apathy, loneliness, depersonalisation, state anxiety, trait anxiety as well as personality traits. Multiple regressions were performed to determine which psychological factors predicted the variance of health anxiety every week using the enter method. RESULTS A combination of psychological variables that varied over time and were modulated by external events predicted the evolution of illness-related perception and associated aversion to perceived threat. CONCLUSION Our findings highlight how in the face of a public health crisis, psychological factors play a determining role in the synthesis of beliefs as well as guiding human behaviour.","Bonsu, A; Walker, P; Edey, J; Rea, P; Kaski, D; Kheradmand, A; Saman, Y; Staab, J P; Arshad, Q",Public health,457,16

The use of telemedicine in stroke makes it possible to bring the expertise of academic stroke centers to underserved areas, potentially increasing the quality of stroke care. METHODS All consecutive admissions for stroke were reviewed for 1 year before telemedicine implementation and for variable periods thereafter. A retrospective review identified 2588 admissions for acute stroke between March 2005 and December 2008 at 12 hospitals participating in a telestroke network, including 919 patients before telemedicine was available and 1669 patients after telemedicine was available. The primary outcome measure was the rate of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) use before and after telemedicine implementation. RESULTS One hundred thirty-nine patients received IV tPA in both study phases, with 26 (2.8%) patients treated before starting telemedicine and 113 (6.8%) after starting telemedicine (P < .001). Incorrect treatment decisions occurred 7 times (0.39%), with 2 (0.2%) pretelemedicine and 5 (0.3%) posttelemedicine (P = .70). Arrivals within 3 hours from symptom onset were more frequent in the posttelemedicine compared to the pretelemedicine phases (55 [6%] vs 159 [9.5%]; P = .002). Among the patients treated with IV tPA, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 2 patients (1 [10.7%] pretelemedicine vs 1 [1.8%] posttelemedicine; P = .34). CONCLUSIONS Telestroke implementation was associated with an increased rate of thrombolytic use in remote hospitals within the telemedicine network.","Amorim, Edilberto; Shih, Min-Mei; Koehler, Steven A; Massaro, Lori L; Zaidi, Syed F; Jumaa, Mouhammad A; Reddy, Vivek K; Hammer, Maxim D; Jovin, Tudor G; Wechsler, Lawrence R",Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,457,29

PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and PEDro databases were searched, and papers related to COVID-19 and rehabilitation were retrieved and summarized descriptively. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS The database search retrieved 2704 publications. Duplicates were removed, and 1185 unique records were screened for inclusion. After screening titles, abstracts and full-texts, 22 papers were included in the present review. According to OCEBM 2011 Levels of Evidence table, 17 studies (77%) fall within the level of evidence 4 category, while the remainder (23%) are categorized as level of evidence 3. Most studies (N.=19; 86%) provided epidemiological data about the disease natural history/determining factor or the clinical presentation of COVID-19 infection, while only two studies focused on health service organization and intervention efficacy. CONCLUSIONS The most recent published COVID-19 research relevant to rehabilitation primarily provides data on the clinical course and the clinical presentation of the pathology, rather than on rehabilitation interventions or service delivery. Studies with high levels of evidence regarding the efficacy of interventions, long-term monitoring, or new health service organization models are lacking.","Negrini, Francesco; De Sire, Alessandro; Andrenelli, Elisa; Lazzarini, Stefano G; Patrini, Michele; Ceravolo, Maria G",European journal of physical and rehabilitation medicine,457,1

We evaluated the clinical status of COVID-19 survivors at three months after hospital discharge. METHODS In this prospective observational cohort study, hospitalized patients aged ≥18 years, evaluated at one (M1) and three (M3) months post-discharge were enrolled. 251 patients (71.3% males, median [IQR] age 61.8 [53.5-70.7] years) were included. Median (IQR) time from discharge to M3 was 89 (79.5-101) days. Primary outcome was residual respiratory dysfunction (RRD), defined by tachypnea, moderate to very severe dyspnea, or peripheral oxygen saturation ≤95% on room air at M3. RESULTS RRD was found in 30.4% of patients, with no significant difference compared with M1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and length of stay were independent predictors of RRD at multivariable logistic regression (odds ratio, OR, [95% confidence interval, CI] 4.13 [1.17-16.88], p 0.033; OR [95% CI] 1.02 [1.00-1.04], p 0.047, respectively). Obesity and C-reactive protein levels upon admission were additional predictors at regression tree analysis. Impaired quality of life (QoL) was reported by 53.2% of patients. Anxiety and insomnia were each present in 25.5% of patients, and PTSD in 22.4%. No difference was found between M1 and M3 in QoL, anxiety or PTSD. Insomnia decreased at M3. Current major psychiatric disorder as well as anxiety, insomnia and PSTD at M1 independently predicted PTSD at M3. CONCLUSIONS Clinical damage may persist at three months after discharge in COVID-19 survivors.

DESIGN Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of combined exercise-nutrition interventions on hospitalised prefrail/frail older adults ≥65 years were collated from MEDLINE, Emcare, CINAHL, Ageline, Scopus, Cochrane and PEDro on 10 October 2019. The methodological quality was appraised, and data were summarised descriptively or by meta-analysis using a fixed effects model. The standardised mean difference (SMD) or difference of means (MD) with 95% CIs was calculated. RESULTS Twenty articles from 11 RCTs experimenting exercise-nutrition interventions on hospitalised older adults were included. Seven articles were suitable for the meta-analyses. One study had low risk of bias and found improvements in physical performance and frailty-related biomarkers. Exercise interventions were mostly supervised by a physiotherapist, focusing on strength, ranging 2-5 times/week, of 20-90 min duration. Most nutrition interventions involved counselling and supplementation but had dietitian supervision in only three studies. The meta-analyses suggest that participants who received exercise-nutrition intervention had greater reduction in frailty scores (n=3, SMD 0.25; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.46; p=0.02) and improvement in short physical performance battery (SPPB) scores (n=3, MD 0.48; 95% CI 0.12 to 0.84; p=0.008) compared with standard care. Only the chair-stand test (n=3) out of the three SPPB components was significantly improved (MD 0.26; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.43; p=0.003). Patients were more independent in activities of daily living in intervention groups, but high heterogeneity was observed (I2=96%, p<0.001).

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a new 2.45-GHz thermosphere MWA system in the treatment of malignant liver tumors. METHODS This was a prospective IRB-approved study of 18 patients with malignant liver tumors treated with MWA within a 3-month time period. Tumor sizes and response to MWA were obtained from triphasic liver CT scans done before and after MWA. The ablation zones were assessed for complete tumor response and spherical geometry. RESULTS There were a total of 18 patients with an average of three tumors measuring 1.4 cm (range 0.2-4). Ablations were performed laparoscopically in all, but three patients who underwent combined liver resection. A single ablation was created in 72% and overlapping ablations in 28% of lesions. Total ablation time per patient was 15.6 ± 1.9 min. There was no morbidity or mortality. At 2-week CT scans, there was 100% tumor destruction, with no residual lesions. Roundness indices A, B and transverse were 1.1, 0.9 and 0.9, respectively, confirming the spherical nature of ablation zones.

However, even after the radiological advent of atelectasis, great variability in clinical outcomes can be observed. METHODS The baseline clinical measures (vital capacity (VC), forced expiratory flow in 1 s (FEV1 ), residual volume (RV) and 6-min walk test (6-MWT)) and computed tomography variables (low attenuation volume (LAV) of the target lobe, LAV% of the target and the ipsilateral untreated lobe and LAV of the target lobe to LAV of the target lung and to LAV of the total lung) of 77 patients with complete atelectasis following valve therapy were retrospectively examined to determine their impact on patient´s outcome (changes in VC, FEV1 , RV and 6-MWT from baseline to the time of atelectasis). RESULTS Low attenuation volume of the target lobe to LAV of the target lung predicts a significant FEV1 improvement in patients with complete lobar atelectasis following valve therapy. A 10% difference in that computed tomography predictor was associated with a 82-mL improvement in FEV1 (P = 0.006). Lower 6-MWT scores, low VC and high RV at baseline were significantly associated with greater improvement in the respective parameter (all P < 0.001). CONCLUSION Low attenuation volume of the target lobe to LAV of the target lung and baseline clinical measures seem to significantly predict clinical outcomes in patients with complete lobar atelectasis following valve treatment.","Gompelmann, Daniela; Hofbauer, Tobias; Gerovasili, Vasiliki; Eberhardt, Ralf; Lim, Hyun-Ju; Herth, Felix; Heussel, Claus-Peter",Respirology,457,1

To accelerate it, autologous mesenchymal stem cells have been directly injected to the distraction site in a few recent studies. Compared to direct injection, a scaffold-based method can provide earlier cell delivery with potentially better controlled cell distribution and retention. This pilot project investigated a scaffold-based cell-delivery approach in a porcine mandibular DO model. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eleven adolescent domestic pigs were used for two major sets of studies. The in-vitro set established methodologies to: aspirate bone marrow from the tibia; isolate, characterize and expand bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs); enhance BM-MSC osteogenic differentiation using FGF-2; and confirm cell integration with a gelatin-based Gelfoam scaffold. The in-vivo set transplanted autologous stem cells into the mandibular distraction sites using Gelfoam scaffolds; completed a standard DO-course and assessed bone regeneration by macroscopic, radiographic and histological methods. Repeated-measure ANOVAs and t-tests were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS From aspirated bone marrow, multi-potent, heterogeneous BM-MSCs purified from hematopoietic stem cell contamination were obtained. FGF-2 significantly enhanced pig BM-MSC osteogenic differentiation and proliferation, with 5 ng/ml determined as the optimal dosage. Pig BM-MSCs integrated readily with Gelfoam and maintained viability and proliferative ability. After integration with Gelfoam scaffolds, 2.4-5.8×10(7) autologous BM-MSCs (undifferentiated or differentiated) were transplanted to each experimental DO site. Among 8 evaluable DO sites included in the final analyses, the experimental DO sites demonstrated less interfragmentary mobility, more advanced gap obliteration, higher mineral content and faster mineral apposition than the control sites, and all transplanted scaffolds were completely degraded. CONCLUSION It is technically feasible and biologically sound to deliver autologous BM-MSCs to the distraction site immediately after osteotomy using a Gelfoam scaffold to enhance mandibular DO.","Sun, Zongyang; Tee, Boon Ching; Kennedy, Kelly S; Kennedy, Patrick M; Kim, Do-Gyoon; Mallery, Susan R; Fields, Henry W",PloS one,457,1
139884,139884,139884,Pulmonary cowpox in cats: five cases.,9.871673,4.9666395,2016,"BACKGROUND Deferring cord clamping has proven benefits for both term and preterm infants, and recent studies have demonstrated better cardio-respiratory stability if clamping is based on the infant's physiology, and whether the infant has breathed. Nevertheless, current guidelines for neonatal resuscitation still recommend early cord clamping (ECC) for compromised babies, unless equipment and competent personnel to resuscitate the baby are available at the mother's bedside. The objective of this quality improvement cohort study was to evaluate whether implementing a new delivery room protocol involving mobile resuscitation equipment (LifeStart™) reduced the prevalence of ECC in assisted vaginal deliveries. METHODS Data on cord clamping and transitional care were collected 8 months before and 8 months after implementing the new protocol. The Model for Improvement was applied to identify drivers and obstacles to practice change. Statistical Process Control analysis was used to demonstrate signals of improvement, and whether these changes were sustainable. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the impact of the new protocol on the primary outcome, adjusted for possible confounders. RESULTS Overall prevalence of ECC dropped from 13 to 1% (P < 0.01), with a 98% relative risk reduction for infants needing transitional support on a resuscitation table (adjusted OR 0.02, P < 0.001). Mean cord clamping time increased by 43% (p < 0.001). Although fewer infants were placed directly on mothers' chest (n = 43 [42%] vs n = 69 [75.0%], P < 0.001), there were no significant differences in needs for immediate transitional care or transfers to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. A pattern of improvement was seen already before the intervention, especially after mandatory educational sessions and cross-professional simulation training. CONCLUSIONS A new delivery-room protocol involving mobile resuscitation equipment successfully eliminated early cord clamping in assisted vaginal deliveries of term and near-term infants. A systematic approach, like the Model for Improvement, seemed crucial for both achieving and sustaining the desired results.

It is a new virus disease, nobody has prior immunity to it, human population is prone to infections. In March 11 2020, WHO declared the pandemic status. The main symptoms include: fever, dry cough and fatigue. Virus proteins need mitochondrial energy for their own survival and replication. Upon viral infections, mitochondrial dynamics and metabolism can be modulated, which can influence the energy production in the host cells. Coenzyme Q10 is an integral component of mitochondrial respiratory chain and the key component of mitochondrial ATP production. The exact pathobiochemical mechanism of the disease is unknown. Modulated mitochondrial dynamics and metabolism with lower CoQ10 levels in viral infections leads us to the hypothesis that one of the main pathobiochemical effects of SARS-Cov-2 virus could be mitochondrial bioenergetics dysfunction with CoQ10 deficit leading to the reduction of its endogenous biosynthesis. The mechanism might be virus induced oxidative stress causing a mutation of one or more of the nine COQ genes, resulting in primary CoQ10 deficiency. New perspective for patients with COVID-19 may be supportive targeting therapy with coenzyme Q10 to increase the energy production, immunity and decrease oxidative stress (Fig. 1, Ref. 51).

We estimated the shear modulus of the lateral gastrocnemius (LG) muscle using supersonic shear wave imaging and measured its myoelectrical activity using surface electromyography (sEMG) during graded isometric contractions of plantar flexion and dorsiflexion (n=7). During dorsiflexion, the average shear modulus was 26 ± 6 kPa at peak sEMG amplitude, which was significantly less (P=0.02) than that measured at the same sEMG level during plantar flexion (42 ± 10 kPa). The passive tension during contraction was estimated using the passive LG muscle shear modulus during a passive ankle rotation measured at an equivalent ankle angle to that measured during contraction. The passive shear modulus increased significantly (P<0.01) from the plantar flexed position (16 ± 5 kPa) to the dorsiflexed position (26 ± 9 kPa). Once this change in passive tension from joint rotation was accounted for, the average LG muscle shear modulus due to active contraction was significantly greater (P<0.01) during plantar flexion (26 ± 8 kPa) than at sEMG-matched levels of dorsiflexion (0 ± 4 kPa). The negligible shear modulus estimated during isometric dorsiflexion indicates negligible active force contribution by the LG muscle, despite measured sEMG activity of 19% of maximal voluntary plantar flexion contraction. This strongly suggests that the sEMG activity recorded from the LG muscle during isometric dorsiflexion was primarily due to cross-talk. However, it is clear that passive muscle tension changes can contribute to joint torque during isometric dorsiflexion.","Raiteri, Brent J; Hug, François; Cresswell, Andrew G; Lichtwark, Glen A",Journal of biomechanics,457,12

Early diagnosis, prompt management of sepsis followed by closure of anastomotic defect may increase chances of anastomotic salvage. In this randomized experimental study, we evaluated two different methods of trans-anal anastomotic repair. METHODS A model of anastomotic leak was created in 42 male pigs. Laparoscopic low anterior resection was performed with anastomosis created using a circular stapler with half of the staples removed. Two days later, animals were randomized into a TAMIS (trans-anal minimally invasive surgery) repair, endoscopic suture (ENDO) or control group with no treatment (CONTROL). Signs of intraabdominal infection (IAI), macroscopic anastomotic healing and burst tests were evaluated to assess closure quality after animals were sacrificed on the ninth postoperative day. RESULTS Closure was technically feasible in all 28 animals. Two animals had to be euthanized due to progressive sepsis at four and five days after endoscopic closure. Healed anastomosis with no visible defect was observed in 10/14 and 11/14 animals in TAMIS and ENDO groups, respectively, versus 2/14 in CONTROL (p < 0.05). Overall IAI rate was significantly lower in TAMIS (4/14; p = 0.006) and ENDO (5/14; p = 0.018) compared to CONTROL (12/14). Burst tests confirmed sealed closure in healed anastomosis with a median failure pressure of 190 (110-300) mmHg in TAMIS and 200 (100-300) mmHg in ENDO group (p = 0.644). CONCLUSION In this randomized experimental study, we found that both evaluated techniques are effective in early repair of dehiscent colorectal anastomosis with a high healing rate.","Kalvach, J; Ryska, O; Martinek, J; Hucl, T; Pazin, J; Hadac, J; Foltan, O; Kristianova, H; Ptacnik, J; Juhasova, J; Ryska, M; Juhas, S",Surgical endoscopy,457,1

METHODS Patients who suffered from fractures or soft-tissue trauma between March 21, 2020, and June 1, 2020, (group pandemic) and during the same period in 2019 (control group) were included in our single-center retrospective study. Each group was also divided into 3 subgroups according to the age of patients (≤ 20 years, 21-64 years, and ≥ 65 years). Data including anatomical region subjected to trauma, place of admission, mechanism of trauma, location of trauma, mode of treatment, type of surgery (if performed), duration of hospitalization (if hospitalized), time elapsed until surgery, and duration of postoperative hospitalization were collected and compared between groups. RESULTS A total of 361 patients were admitted to the hospital with new trauma during the pandemic, and 708 patients had been admitted during the same period in 2019. The number of admissions decreased significantly by 50.9% (P < 0.001). The mechanism of trauma that occurred with low energy was significantly increased in the pandemic group (73.9%) compared with the control group (47.6%) (P < 0.001). Similarly, the distribution of trauma throughout the skeletal system, especially in the upper extremity, was significantly increased in the pandemic group (49.9% vs. 30.5%, P < 0.001). However, there was no significant decrease in individuals aged above 65 years (P = 0.115). Similar to the general outlook, the 3 groups differed in terms of the mechanism of trauma, location of trauma, and distribution of the anatomical region subjected to trauma (P < 0.001). Majority of the patients received inpatient treatment in all 3 groups (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION The results of this study showed that the pandemic dramatically reduced the number of hospital admissions related to orthopedic trauma. The rate of low energy, upper extremity traumas that occurred indoors increased during the pandemic period compared with that of the previous year. However, the rate of hospital admissions did not differ in the ≥65-year-old subgroup during the pandemic period compared with that of the previous year.","Kalem, Mahmut; Kocaoğlu, Hakan; Merter, Abdullah; Karaca, Mustafa Onur; Özbek, Emre Anıl; Kınık, Hüseyin Hakan",Acta orthopaedica et traumatologica turcica,457,1

Fusion is mediated by the EBOV envelope glycoprotein GP, which consists of subunits GP1 and GP2. GP1 binds to cellular receptors, including Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) protein, and GP2 is responsible for low pH-induced membrane fusion. Proteolytic cleavage and NPC1 binding at endosomal pH lead to conformational rearrangements of GP2 that include exposing the hydrophobic fusion loop (FL) for insertion into the cellular target membrane and forming a six-helix bundle structure. Although major portions of the GP2 structure have been solved in pre- and postfusion states and although current models place the transmembrane (TM) and FL domains of GP2 in close proximity at critical steps of membrane fusion, their structures in membrane environments, and especially interactions between them, have not yet been characterized. Here, we present the structure of the membrane proximal external region (MPER) connected to the TM domain: i.e., the missing parts of the EBOV GP2 structure. The structure, solved by solution NMR and EPR spectroscopy in membrane-mimetic environments, consists of a helix-turn-helix architecture that is independent of pH. Moreover, the MPER region is shown to interact in the membrane interface with the previously determined structure of the EBOV FL through several critical aromatic residues. Mutation of aromatic and neighboring residues in both binding partners decreases fusion and viral entry, highlighting the functional importance of the MPER/TM-FL interaction in EBOV entry and fusion.","Lee, Jinwoo; Nyenhuis, David A; Nelson, Elizabeth A; Cafiso, David S; White, Judith M; Tamm, Lukas K",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,457,12

A thymidine analogue for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), which incorporates the readily available and inexpensive nuclide technetium-99m, would be of considerable practical interest. hTK1 is known to accommodate modification of the structure of the natural substrate thymidine at the positions N3 and C3' and, to a lesser extent, C5. In this work, we used the copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition to synthesize two series of derivatives in which thymidine is functionalized at either the C3' or N3 position with chelating systems suitable for the M(CO)(3) core (M = (99m)Tc, Re). The click chemistry approach enabled complexes with different structures and overall charges to be synthesized from a common precursor. Using this strategy, the first organometallic hTK1 substrates in which thymidine is modified at the C3' position were identified. Phosphorylation of the organometallic derivatives was measured relative to thymidine. We have shown that the influence of the overall charge of the derivatives is dependent on the position of functionalization. In the case of the C3'-functionalized derivatives, neutral and anionic substrates were most readily phosphorylated (20-28% of the value for the parent ligand thymidine), whereas for the N3-functionalized derivatives, cationic and neutral complexes were apparently better substrates for the enzyme (14-18%) than anionic derivatives (9%).","Struthers, Harriet; Viertl, David; Kosinski, Marek; Spingler, Bernhard; Buchegger, Franz; Schibli, Roger",Bioconjugate chemistry,457,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS Between 2001 and 2012, 353 patients (211 female and 142 male), aged 17-76 years (mean 44), underwent laparoscopic antireflux surgery. The study included patients who underwent a Toupet fundoplication or Wroblewski Tadeusz procedure (WTP). RESULTS The mean age of the group was 47.77 years (17-80 years). Forty-nine (32.45%) patients had severe symptoms, 93 (61.58%) had mild symptoms and 9 (5.96%) had a single mild but intolerable sign of GERD. Eighty-six (56.95%) patients had a Toupet fundoplication and 65 (43.04%) had a WTP. The follow-up period was 18-144 months. The average operating time for Toupet fundoplication and the WTP procedure was 164 min (90-300 min) and 147 min (90-210 min), respectively. The perioperative mortality rate was 0.66%.

The patient reached our emergency department with acute left flank pain and massive haematuria. At the moment of admission, the patient was in stage III hypovolemic shock and had a lower haematocrit (haemoglobin = 4.9 g/dL). Despite blood transfusions, emergency surgical exploration, extrafascial nephrectomy and intensive support care, the patient died twelve hours after surgery. CONCLUSIONS Parenchymal renal rupture can be a life-threatening emergency.

We assessed spatial learning (i.e. Morris water maze) within two weeks of PET scanning and correlated the principal component of spatial learning performance scores with voxel-wise β-amyloid and TSPO tracer uptake maps in AppNL-G-F mice, controlled for age and sex. In order to assess the effects of hemispheric asymmetry, we also analyzed correlations of spatial learning performance with tracer uptake in bilateral regions of interest for frontal cortex, entorhinal/piriform cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus, using a regression model. We tested the correlation between regional asymmetry of PET biomarkers with individual spatial learning performance. RESULTS Voxel-wise analyses in AppNL-G-F mice revealed that higher TSPO-PET signal in the amygdala, entorhinal and piriform cortices, the hippocampus and the hypothalamus correlated with spatial learning performance. Region-based analysis showed significant correlations between TSPO expression in the right entorhinal/piriform cortex and the right amygdala and spatial learning performance, whereas there were no such correlations in the left hemisphere. Right lateralized TSPO expression in the amygdala predicted better performance in the Morris water maze (β = -0.470, p = 0.013), irrespective of the global microglial activation and amyloid level. Region-based results for amyloid-PET showed no significant associations with spatial learning. CONCLUSION Elevated microglial activation in the right amygdala-entorhinal-hippocampal complex of AppNL-G-F mice is associated with better spatial learning. Our findings support a protective role of microglia on cognitive function when they highly express TSPO in specific brain regions involved in spatial memory.","Biechele, Gloria; Wind, Karin; Blume, Tanja; Sacher, Christian; Beyer, Leonie; Eckenweber, Florian; Franzmeier, Nicolai; Ewers, Michael; Zott, Benedikt; Lindner, Simon; Gildehaus, Franz-Josef; von Ungern-Sternberg, Barbara; Tahirovic, Sabina; Willem, Michael; Bartenstein, Peter; Cumming, Paul; Rominger, Axel; Herms, Jochen; Brendel, Matthias",NeuroImage,457,1

METHODS 246 patients were enrolled into COVID-19 cohort and 120 patients into influenza cohort. All data were collected and analysed retrospectively. The variables under focus included demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and imaging characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia and comparison were made with influenza pneumonia. RESULTS The COVID-19 cohort included 53.25% female and 46.75% male. Their main symptom was fever; while 28.05% of patients had only initially fever; 21.54% of them remained feverless. After excluding prior kidney diseases, some patients showed abnormal urinalysis (32.11%), elevated blood creatinine (15.04%) and blood urea nitrogen (19.11%). Typical CT features included ground glass opacity, consolidation and band opacity, which could present as characteristic 'bat wing sign'. Our data showed that male, aged 65 or above, smoking, with comorbidities including diabetes, cardiovascular and kidney diseases, would experience more severe COVID-19 pneumonia. In comparison, COVID-19 cohort showed significantly higher incidence of clustering; the influenza cohort showed higher rate of fever. Both cohorts showed reduced lymphocyte numbers; however, 6 influenza patients showed lymphocytes increased, which was statistical significant compared with COVID-19 cohort. Also, influenza cohort displayed higher white blood cell counts and PCT values. CONCLUSION There is no significant gender difference in the incidence of COVID-19 pneumonia. It predominantly affects the lung as well as the kidney. Age, smoking and comorbidities could contribute to disease severity. Although COVID-19 is more infectious, the rate of secondary bacterial infection is lower than influenza.","Qu, Jiajia; Chang, Lap Kam; Tang, Xinghua; Du, Yiming; Yang, Xi; Liu, Xiangjiao; Han, Ping; Xue, Yuwen",Acta clinica Belgica,457,16

The unexpected effects of the recent pandemic ignited conversations about scarcity of resources and withholding medical interventions, based on age, among providers with limited expertise in palliative care. Using a case study and literature review, the aim of this article was to examine the best ethical considerations for resource allocation decision making that minimizes the effects of ageism. Public health ethics differs from clinical ethics by giving priority to promoting the greatest good over the protection of individual autonomy. This divide in ethics sheds light on the dangers associated with ageism. Age is often a component within clinical instruments that guide clinicians with allocation decisions. Basing decisions solely on age without evaluating health and functional status is dangerous and further propagates the discriminatory practices that fuel ageism. Previous research identified using ethical principles to guide resource allocation decisions but that may not be enough to protect the rights of older adults. A new model to guide these decisions should include advance directives and goals of care, medical indicators instead of demographics, functionality, transparent medical team, and impact of social determinants of health.","Lowey, Susan E",Journal of hospice and palliative nursing : JHPN : the official journal of the Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association,457,1

The sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER) represents the largest endogenous Ca2+ store, which releases Ca2+ through ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and/or inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs) upon extracellular stimulation. The acidic vesicles of the endolysosomal (EL) compartment represent an additional endogenous Ca2+ store, which is targeted by several second messengers, including nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [PI(3,5)P2], and may release intraluminal Ca2+ through multiple Ca2+ permeable channels, including two-pore channels 1 and 2 (TPC1-2) and Transient Receptor Potential Mucolipin 1 (TRPML1). Herein, we discuss the emerging, pathophysiological role of EL Ca2+ signaling in the CV system. We describe the role of cardiac TPCs in β-adrenoceptor stimulation, arrhythmia, hypertrophy, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. We then illustrate the role of EL Ca2+ signaling in VSMCs, where TPCs promote vasoconstriction and contribute to pulmonary artery hypertension and atherosclerosis, whereas TRPML1 sustains vasodilation and is also involved in atherosclerosis. Subsequently, we describe the mechanisms whereby endothelial TPCs promote vasodilation, contribute to neurovascular coupling in the brain and stimulate angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Finally, we discuss about the possibility to target TPCs, which are likely to mediate CV cell infection by the Severe Acute Respiratory Disease-Coronavirus-2, with Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs to alleviate the detrimental effects of Coronavirus Disease-19 on the CV system.","Negri, Sharon; Faris, Pawan; Moccia, Francesco",International review of cell and molecular biology,457,10

In a prespecified subgroup analysis, we report comparative effects of different doses of intravenous alteplase according to prior APT use among participants of the international multicenter ENCHANTED study (Enhanced Control of Hypertension and Thrombolysis Stroke Study). METHODS Among 3285 alteplase-treated patients (mean age, 66.6 years; 38% women) randomly assigned to low-dose (0.6 mg/kg) or standard-dose (0.9 mg/kg) intravenous alteplase within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, 752 (22.9%) reported prior APT use. Primary outcome at 90 days was the combined end point of death or disability (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] scores, 2-6). Other outcomes included mRS scores 3 to 6, ordinal mRS shift, and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage by various standard criteria. RESULTS There were no significant differences in outcome between patients with and without prior APT after adjustment for baseline characteristics and management factors during the first week; defined by mRS scores 2 to 6 (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81-1.26; P=0.953), 3 to 6 (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.75-1.20; P=0.662), or ordinal mRS shift (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.87-1.21; P=0.770). Alteplase-treated patients on prior APT had higher symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.00-3.30; P=0.051) according to the safe implementation of thrombolysis in stroke-monitoring study definition. Although not significant (P-trend, 0.053), low-dose alteplase tended to have better outcomes than standard-dose alteplase in those on prior APT compared with those not using APT (mRS scores of 2-6; OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.62-1.12 versus OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.99-1.36). CONCLUSIONS Low-dose alteplase may improve outcomes in thrombolysis-treated acute ischemic stroke patients on prior APT, but this requires further evaluation in a randomized controlled trial.

RESULTS Thirty patients were identified. Twenty underwent simultaneous panniculectomy. The median pannus weight was 5.2 kg. Greater all-cause postoperative complications and wound-related morbidity occurred in the panniculectomy group (P < .05). Performing a panniculectomy increased the risk for a wound complication by 5-fold (P = .04). Following 7-month to 9-month follow-up, both groups had a recurrence rate of 10%. CONCLUSION Simultaneous panniculectomy in the setting of complex abdominal wall reconstruction is feasible but associated with significant postoperative morbidity.

Eighty patients undergoing systemic anesthesia with extracorporeal coronary artery bypass grafting in The People's Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region from January 2015 to August 2017 were selected and randomly divided into the observation group (n=40) and control group (n=40). The two groups were treated with dexmedetomidine and equal volume of normal saline, respectively. Moreover, safety indexes including EEG bispectral index (BIS) at 30 min before induction of anesthesia (T0), immediately after intubation (T1), when incision was made (T2), when chest was closed (T3), when operation was completed (T4) and at 6 h after operation (T5), intraoperative circulatory system-related complications, cortisol, epinephrine and norepinephrine levels at the end of surgery as well as anesthesia recovery time and postoperative mechanical ventilation time were recorded and compared. All the patients were followed up for 1 week. Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) were administered at 1, 3 and 7 days after operation, and the incidence of intraoperative awareness and postoperative cognitive dysfunction was recorded. BIS value in the observation group was lower than that in the control group (P<0.05) at T1-T4 time points, and the BIS value in the observation group was higher than that in the control group (P<0.05) at T5. Incidence rates of intraoperative arrhythmia, hypertension and hypotension in the observation group was significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.05). At the end of operation, levels of cortisol, epinephrine and norepinephrine in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.05). Anesthesia recovery time and postoperative mechanical ventilation time in the observation group was significantly shorter than the time in the control group (P<0.05). MMSE and MoCA scores of the observation group were better than those of the control group (P<0.05). The incidence of cognitive impairment and postoperative cognitive impairment in the observation group was significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.05). Therefore, it is concluded that dexmedetomidine can effectively reduce the incidence of postoperative cognitive impairment in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, and it is of high safety for circulatory function.","Gong, Zheng; Li, Jun; Zhong, Yuling; Guan, Xuehai; Huang, Ailan; Ma, Li",Experimental and therapeutic medicine,457,16

PIP5Kγ-immunoreactivity was localized for the first time in the muscle spindles, in which it was found in I-bands of polar regions of intrafusal muscle fibers and also in sensory nerve terminals abutting on equatorial regions of the muscle fibers. This finding indicates the involvement of PIP5Kγ in the proprioception and suggests somehow complicated mechanisms of its involvement because of its heterogeneous localization in intra-I-band structures. In DRG, on the other hand, PIP5Kγ-immunoreactivity was shown to be localized heterogeneously, but not evenly, over apposed plasma membranes of both neurons and ganglionic satellite cells in immune electron microscopy. In addition, no peripheral nerve terminals of DRG showing its distinct immunoreactivity were found in most peripheral fields of nociception and any other sensory perception except for the proprioception through muscle spindles. In contrast, numerous central terminals of DRG in the spinal posterior horn were immunoreactive for it. This finding leads us to consider the possibility that the regulation by PIP5Kγ of nociception is dominantly exerted in DRG and sensory neural tracts central, rather than peripheral, to DRG.","Chomphoo, Surang; Sakagami, Hiroyuki; Kondo, Hisatake; Hipkaeo, Wiphawi",Journal of anatomy,457,16

Covid-19 has posed for Sri Lanka not only a public health challenge and an economic challenge but also, perhaps most seriously, a crisis of constitutional democracy. Although questions have been raised about the accuracy of government statistics, the scale of testing and contact tracing, and failures in providing protective equipment to front-line workers including military personnel, there is broad public approval of the government’s crisis response. However, much more alarming are the clear signs in the government’s response that the public health emergency has provided the impetus for an aggressive executive takeover of the state, steepening the curve of de-democratization. The chapter then describes the aspects of the governmental crisis response that are the cause of worry, and offers an analysis based on a framework drawn from comparative politics and comparative constitutional law as to the agentic, institutional, and causal dimensions of the democratic backslide underway in Sri Lanka. While the pandemic has undoubtedly boosted the process of executive aggrandizement that had already commenced, this catalysis may in fact also shorten the authoritarian cycle, because the accelerated de-democratization is likely to result in executive actions that cross the threshold of public tolerance sooner in what as yet remains a procedural democracy. © the several contributors 2021.","Fonseka, B.; Ganeshathasan, L.; Welikala, A.",Covid-19 in Asia: Law and Policy Contexts,457,20

The most widely used vaccine is based on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing the EBOV glycoprotein (GP)(VSV-EBOV). Due to its favorable immune cell targeting, this vaccine has also been used as base-vector for the development of second generation VSV-based vaccines against Influenza, Nipah, and Zika viruses. However, in these situations it may be beneficial if the immunogenicity against EBOV GP is minimized to induce a better protective immune response against the other foreign immunogen. Here, we analyzed if EBOV GP can be truncated to be less immunogenic yet still able to drive replication of the vaccine vector. We found that the EBOV GP glycan cap and the mucin-like domain are both dispensable for VSV-EBOV replication. The glycan cap domain, however, appears critical for mediating a protective immune response against lethal EBOV challenge in mice.","Bhatia, Bharti; Furuyama, Wakako; Hoenen, Thomas; Feldmann, Heinz; Marzi, Andrea",bioRxiv,457,28

The main limitation has been that, although flow cytometry is a science, cell sorting has been an art during most of this time. Recent advances in assisting technologies have helped to decrease the amount of expertise necessary to perform sorting. METHODS Droplet-based sorting is based on a controlled disturbance of a jet stream dependent on surface tension. Sorting yield and purity are highly dependent on stable jet break-off position. System pressures and orifice diameters dictate the number of droplets per second, which is the sort rate limiting step because modern electronics can more than handle the higher cell signal processing rates. RESULTS Cell sorting still requires considerable expertise. Complex multicolor sorting also requires new and more sophisticated sort decisions, especially when cell subpopulations are rare and need to be extracted from background. High-speed sorting continues to pose major problems in terms of biosafety due to the aerosols generated. CONCLUSIONS Cell sorting has become more stable and predictable and requires less expertise to operate. However, the problems of aerosol containment continue to make droplet-based cell sorting problematical. Fluid physics and cell viability restraints pose practical limits for high-speed sorting that have almost been reached. Over the next 5 years there may be advances in fluidic switching sorting in lab-on-a-chip microfluidic systems that could not only solve the aerosol and viability problems but also make ultra high-speed sorting possible and practical through massively parallel and exponential staging microfluidic architectures.","Leary, James F",Cytometry.

METHODS We randomly selected 10 cafes, 10 restaurants, 10 bars, five churches, and five supermarkets and visited them at their busiest times. We evaluated the display of QR code posters using a six-item assessment tool that was based on guidance provided to businesses and services by the Ministry of Health, and we counted the number of people who entered each venue during a one-hour period and the number who scanned the QR code poster. RESULTS All six criteria for displaying QR code posters were met at half of the hospitality venues, four of five churches, and all supermarkets. Scanning proportions were low at all venues (median 10.2%), and at 12 (30%) no visitors scanned; eight of these venues were bars.

Both full-length and subgenomic negative-strand RNA synthesis are initiated at the 3' terminus of the positive-strand genomic RNA of Equine arteritis virus (EAV). To investigate the molecular mechanism of EAV RNA synthesis, the RNA secondary structure of the 3'-proximal region of the genome was analysed by chemical and enzymic probing. Based on the RNA secondary structure model derived from this analysis, several deletions were engineered in a full-length cDNA copy of the viral genome. Two RNA domains were identified that are essential for virus replication and most likely play a key role in viral RNA synthesis. The first domain, located directly upstream of the 3' untranslated region (UTR) (nt 12610-12654 of the genome), is mainly single-stranded but contains one small stem-loop structure. The second domain is located within the 3' UTR (nt 12661-12690) and folds into a prominent stem-loop structure with a large loop region. The location of this stem-loop structure near the 3' terminus of the genome suggests that it may act as a recognition signal during the initiation of minus-strand RNA synthesis.","Beerens, Nancy; Snijder, Eric J",The Journal of general virology,457,28

Human γδ T-cells play a critical role in the immune response against viruses, and studies of WNV meningoencephalitis in laboratory mice described a role of γδ T-cells in the protective immune response. Aim of this study was to analyze the cytolytic and non-cytolytic antiviral activity of human Vδ2 T-cells against WNV replication. The anti-WNV activity of soluble factor released by zoledronic acid (ZA)-activated Vδ2 T-cell lines and the cytotoxic capability of Vδ2 T-cell lines against WNV-infected cells were tested in vitro. The activation of Vδ2 T-cell lines was able to inhibit WNV replication through the release of soluble factors. IFN-γ is massively released by activated Vδ2 T-cell lines and is involved in the anti-WNV activity. Moreover, the Vδ2 T-cell lines can efficiently kill WNV-infected cells possibly through perforin-mediated mechanism. Altogether, our results provide insight into the effector functions of human Vδ2 T-cells against WNV. The possibility to target these cells by ZA, a commercially available drug used in humans, could potentially offer a new immunotherapeutic strategy for WNV infection.","Agrati, Chiara; Castilletti, Concetta; Cimini, Eleonora; Romanelli, Antonella; Lapa, Daniele; Quartu, Serena; Martini, Federico; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria",The new microbiologica,457,4

One assay was based on a set of primers, which amplified a 426-bp fragment of either bovine or ovine RSV F gene (RT-PCR F). The F products could be distinguished by EcoRI or BstYI restriction endonuclease cleavage. In the other assay, a set of primers amplified a 542-bp fragment of either ovine or bovine RSV G gene (RT-PCR G). EcoO1091 and RsaI restriction enzymes were used to differentiate between the ovine and bovine PCR-G products. Sequencing of the PCR products confirmed the fidelity of both assays. The 2 assays were evaluated using 18 bovine RSV isolates, 1 ovine RSV, 1 bighorn sheep RSV isolate, 1 caprine RSV isolate, 2 human RSV isolates, and several other viruses associated with bovine respiratory tract disease. RT-PCR G may be more sensitive in detecting viral RNA. Because the target sequence of the F gene is more conserved than that of the G gene, RT-PCR F followed by the appropriate restriction enzyme cleavage may be superior to RT-PCR G to discriminate between the 2 ruminant RSV subgroups. This assay should prove useful for determining the relative contribution of ovine and bovine RSV to the pathogenesis of bovine respiratory tract disease.","Eleraky, Nasser Z; Kania, Stephen A; Evermann, James F; Potgieter, Leon N D","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",457,9

Variability in length of hospital stay (LOS) was evident in this population. The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to prompt discharge of effected patients in order to reduce contagion risk. LOS and discharge destination in COVID-19 negative patients has not been studied. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the LOS and discharge destination during the COVID-19 outbreak and compare it with a similar cohort in preceding years. METHODS A retrospective study was conducted comparing a total of 182 consecutive fragility hip fracture patients operated on during the first COVID-19 outbreak to patients operated on in 2 preceding years. Data regarding demographic, co-morbidities, surgical management, hospitalization, as well as surgical and medical complications were retrieved from electronic charts. RESULTS During the pandemic 67 fragility hip fracture patients were admitted (COVID group); 55 and 60 patients were admitted during the same time periods in 2017 and 2018, respectively (control groups). All groups were of similar age and gender. Patients in the COVID group had significantly shorter LOS (7.2 ± 3.3 vs. 8.9 ± 4.9 days, P = 0.008) and waiting time for a rehabilitation facility (7.2 ± 3.1 vs. 9.3 ± 4.9 days, P = 0.003), but greater prevalence of delirium (17.9% vs. 7% of patients, P = 0.028). In hospital mortality did not differ among groups. CONCLUSIONS LOS and time to rehabilitation were significantly shorter in the COVID group.

All patients underwent an endoscopic transnasal approach to the orbital apex and cavernous sinus. The surgical technique required a standard endoscopic sinus surgery set. The possible complications were recorded and classified as intraoperative or postoperative. RESULTS There were complications in 8 cases: 4 intraoperative and 4 postoperative. The intraoperative complications included rupture of the internal carotid artery in 1 patient and cerebrospinal fluid leak in 3 patients. All intraoperative complications were resolved during surgery. The postoperative complications were transitory eyelid ptosis in 2 patients (resolved in 6 months) and transitory diplopia with immediate deficit of the medial rectus muscle in 2 patients (completely resolved in 1 month).

An understanding of the patterns of transmission and the effects on public health in relation to control measures that were taken will help health officials prepare for any future outbreaks. METHODS We analyzed SARS case, quarantine, and hotline records in relation to control measures. The two phases of the outbreak were compared. RESULTS Toronto Public Health investigated 2132 potential cases of SARS, identified 23,103 contacts of SARS patients as requiring quarantine, and logged 316,615 calls on its SARS hotline. In Toronto, 225 residents met the case definition of SARS, and all but 3 travel-related cases were linked to the index patient, from Hong Kong. SARS spread to 11 (58 percent) of Toronto's acute care hospitals. Unrecognized SARS among in-patients with underlying illness caused a resurgence, or a second phase, of the outbreak, which was finally controlled through active surveillance of hospitalized patients. In response to the control measures of Toronto Public Health, the number of persons who were exposed to SARS in nonhospital and nonhousehold settings dropped from 20 (13 percent) before the control measures were instituted (phase 1) to 0 afterward (phase 2). The number of patients who were exposed while in a hospital ward rose from 25 (17 percent) in phase 1 to 68 (88 percent) in phase 2, and the number exposed while in the intensive care unit dropped from 13 (9 percent) in phase 1 to 0 in phase 2. Community spread (the length of the chains of transmission outside of hospital settings) was significantly reduced in phase 2 of the outbreak (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS The transmission of SARS in Toronto was limited primarily to hospitals and to households that had had contact with patients. For every case of SARS, health authorities should expect to quarantine up to 100 contacts of the patients and to investigate 8 possible cases. During an outbreak, active in-hospital surveillance for SARS-like illnesses and heightened infection-control measures are essential.","Svoboda, Tomislav; Henry, Bonnie; Shulman, Leslie; Kennedy, Erin; Rea, Elizabeth; Ng, Wil; Wallington, Tamara; Yaffe, Barbara; Gournis, Effie; Vicencio, Elisa; Basrur, Sheela; Glazier, Richard H",The New England journal of medicine,457,26

Recent studies indicated that the SARS-CoV viral spike glycoprotein is a class I viral fusion protein. A fusion peptide present at the N-terminal region of class I viral fusion proteins is believed to initiate viral and cell membrane interactions and subsequent fusion. Although the SARS-CoV fusion protein heptad repeats have been well characterized, the fusion peptide has yet to be identified. Based on the conserved features of known viral fusion peptides and using Wimley and White interfacial hydrophobicity plots, we have identified two putative fusion peptides (SARS(WW-I) and SARS(WW-II)) at the N terminus of the SARS-CoV S2 subunit. Both peptides are hydrophobic and rich in alanine, glycine, and/or phenylalanine residues and contain a canonical fusion tripeptide along with a central proline residue. Only the SARS(WW-I) peptide strongly partitioned into the membranes of large unilamellar vesicles (LUV), adopting a beta-sheet structure. Likewise, only SARS(WW-I) induced the fusion of LUV and caused membrane leakage of vesicle contents at peptide/lipid ratios of 1:50 and 1:100, respectively. The activity of this synthetic peptide appeared to be dependent on its amino acid (aa) sequence, as scrambling the peptide rendered it unable to partition into LUV, assume a defined secondary structure, or induce both fusion and leakage of LUV. Based on the activity of SARS(WW-I), we propose that the hydrophobic stretch of 19 aa corresponding to residues 770 to 788 is a fusion peptide of the SARS-CoV S2 subunit.","Sainz, Bruno; Rausch, Joshua M; Gallaher, William R; Garry, Robert F; Wimley, William C",Journal of virology,457,19

The results show that these variants are all more sensitive to conditions affecting the structural integrity of this protein. The structural analyses of these variants reveal a high population of more unstable beta-domain and distorted hydrophobic core compared to the wild-type human lysozyme, particularly for the two natural amyloidogenic variants D67H and I56T. For the D67H variant, the distance between the mass centers of residues 54 and 67 was found to elongate as a result of the destruction of the hydrogen-bonding network stabilizing the two long loops in the beta-domain. It further accelerates the unfolding of this variant, starting from the hydrophobic core between the alpha- and beta-domains. For the I56T variant, the introduction of a hydrophilic residue in the hydrophobic core directly destroys the native contacts in the alpha-beta interface, leading to fast unfolding. The present results are consistent with the previous hypothesis suggesting that the distortion of the hydrophobic core at the alpha-beta interface putatively results in the formation of the initial ""seed"" for amyloid fibrils.","Liu, Hsuan-Liang; Wu, Yi-Ching; Zhao, Jian-Hua; Liu, Yi-Fan; Huang, Chi-Hung; Fang, Hsu-Wei; Ho, Yih",Biotechnology progress,457,16

Appearing in 1997 and becoming epidemic in 2003, influenza A/H5N1 provoked many deadly enzootics in poultry batteries (highly pathogenic avian influenza of HPAI). Starting in Asia, many countries throughout Africa and Europe were affected. Sporadic human cases were described in direct contact with diseased chicken or other poultry. Half of the cases are lethal, but human to human transmission occurs with difficulty. From January 2003 to August 11th 2009, 438 cases were declared worldwide with 262 deaths. Many countries declared cases, but recently most cases occurred in Egypt. Measures in hospital were taken which were copied from the measures for SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), but these were probably excessive in this case, considering the low rate of secondary cases with A/H5N1. In many human infections, signs of severe respiratory distress develop and multi organ failure. It was feared that this deadly virus could become easily transmitted between humans, leading to a new pandemic. This was not the case up to now. The strong pathogenicity of the virus is still not completely explained, but the deep location of infection in the lungs and the deregulation of cytokine production by the target cells, particularly macrophages, may be part of the explanation.","Goubau, P",Bulletin et memoires de l'Academie royale de medecine de Belgique,457,16

While China-where the outbreak started-seems to have been able to contain the growth of the epidemic, different outbreaks are nowadays present in multiple countries. Nonetheless, authorities have taken action and implemented containment measures, even if not everything is known. METHODS: To facilitate this task, we have studied the effect of different containment strategies that can be put into effect. Our work referred initially to the situation in Spain as of February 28, 2020, where a few dozens of cases had been detected, but has been updated to match the current situation as of 13 April. We implemented an SEIR metapopulation model that allows tracing explicitly the spatial spread of the disease through data-driven stochastic simulations. RESULTS: Our results are in line with the most recent recommendations from the World Health Organization, namely, that the best strategy is the early detection and isolation of individuals with symptoms, followed by interventions and public recommendations aimed at reducing the transmissibility of the disease, which, although might not be sufficient for disease eradication, would produce as a second order effect a delay of several days in the raise of the number of infected cases. CONCLUSIONS: Many quantitative aspects of the natural history of the disease are still unknown, such as the amount of possible asymptomatic spreading or the role of age in both the susceptibility and mortality of the disease. However, preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be ready for quick and efficacious deployment globally. The scenarios evaluated here through data-driven simulations indicate that measures aimed at reducing individuals' flow are much less effective than others intended for early case identification and isolation. Therefore, resources should be directed towards detecting as many and as fast as possible the new cases and isolate them.","Aleta, Alberto; Moreno, Yamir",BMC Med,457,1

Several clinical studies have shown very good effects of TCZ in patients with COVID-19, with a few minor side effects reported. Only eight serious liver injuries caused by TCZ were reported before being used in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Considering the significantly increased use of TCZ for the treatment of COVID-19, we would like to warn of its rare but possible serious hepatotoxicity, especially when used together with other hepatotoxic drugs. METHODS: We describe a patient with COVID-19-induced cytokine storm who developed drug-induced liver injury associated with the use of TCZ. RESULTS: One day after TCZ administration, serum transaminase levels increased 40-fold. Nevertheless, TCZ had a positive effect on clinical and laboratory parameters in cytokine storm, with transaminases values normalizing in 10 days. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported case of DILI caused by TCZ in a COVID-19 patient. Intensive liver function monitoring is imperative in COVID-19 patients, because of frequent polypharmacy with potentially hepatotoxic drugs.","Muhovic, Damir; Bojovic, Jelena; Bulatovic, Ana; Vukcevic, Batric; Ratkovic, Marina; Lazovic, Ranko; Smolovic, Brigita",Liver Int,457,21

The scientific community and the political authorities fear an epidemic of suicide secondary to this crisis. The aim of this review is to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the dimensions of the suicidal process and its interaction with the various risk factors. We also propose innovative strategies to manage suicidal behavior in the context of pandemic. METHODS: We carried out a narrative review of international publications dealing with major pandemics (COVID-19, SARS) and their influence on suicidal vulnerability. RESULTS: Many factors are likely to increase the emergence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts during this crisis. Social distancing and quarantine could increase the feeling of disconnection and the perception of social pain in vulnerable individuals. Some populations at high suicidal risk could be further impacted by the current pandemic: the elderly, medical staff and individuals exposed to economic insecurity. Several innovative tools adapted to the constraints of social distancing and quarantine may prevent suicide risk: e-health, VigilanS, buddhist-derived practices and art engagement. CONCLUSIONS: This unprecedented crisis may interact with certain dimensions of the suicidal process. However, it is time to innovate. Several suicide prevention tools all have their place in new modes of care and should be tested on a large scale.","Conejero, I; Berrouiguet, S; Ducasse, D; Leboyer, M; Jardon, V; Olié, E; Courtet, P",Encephale,457,27
235407,235407,235407,Shelters Feel Pressure of Pandemic,9.978508,4.801824,2020,"Background: There is increasing interest in the use of telemedicine as a means of health care delivery especially in circumstances of pandemics. This is partly because technological advances have made the equipment less expensive and simpler to use and partly because increasing health care costs and patient expectations have increased the need to find alternative modes of health care delivery. Introduction: Telemedicine and telepsychiatry, in particular, are rapidly becoming important delivery approaches to providing clinical care and information to patients in cases wherein the medical resources and the patients are very hard to be brought together with respect to rules of behavior in case of epidemics. The reliance on technology to bridge the obstacles between the patients (consumers) and medical resources (providers) can create problems that impact service delivery and outcomes, but in cases such as this (COVID-19 pandemics), this is virtually the only tool for providing clinical care and information to patients. Materials and Methods: A client satisfaction survey was undertaken in a daily hospital (a part of University Clinic of Psychiatry in Skopje). The anonymous modified self-report questionnaire (short form patient satisfaction questionnaire [PSQ-18]) covering demographic, gender, and age variables was endorsed by 28 participants. The mean age of the subjects was 40.25 ± 22 years, with a small majority of men (18 participants) versus women (11 participants). Results: Overall satisfaction with psychiatric care was high (80.22%). None of the demographic or other variables correlated significantly with satisfaction. Discussion: We had to reduce rate and time length of our face-to-face contacts with patients as a result of pandemics but they were able to reach their doctors virtually at all times. Conclusions: Many mental health professionals are using widely available, commercial software downloaded from the internet to provide care directly to a patient's home.","Haxhihamza, Kadri; Arsova, Slavica; Bajraktarov, Stojan; Kalpak, Gjorgji; Stefanovski, Branislav; Novotni, Antoni; Milutinovic, Milos",Telemed. j. e. health,457,1

Repeated exposure to the virus can lead to a dose-dependent immune response that may be associated with more disease severity and higher mortality. Sudden deterioration/increased oxygen consumption after initial improvement may be due to multiple surges of cytokines storm within a short period, the possible cause may be due to multiple exposures within the incubation period. We hypothesize that multiple surges in cytokines storm in some patients may be due to multiple exposures of the same patient within the incubation period, sepsis, or other inflammatory lesions inside the body.

Developing efficient short-term forecasting models allow forecasting the number of future cases. In this context, it is possible to develop strategic planning in the public health system to avoid deaths. In this paper, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), cubist regression (CUBIST), random forest (RF), ridge regression (RIDGE), support vector regression (SVR), and stacking-ensemble learning are evaluated in the task of time series forecasting with one, three, and six-days ahead the COVID-19 cumulative confirmed cases in ten Brazilian states with a high daily incidence. In the stacking-ensemble learning approach, the CUBIST regression, RF, RIDGE, and SVR models are adopted as base-learners and Gaussian process (GP) as meta-learner. The models' effectiveness is evaluated based on the improvement index, mean absolute error, and symmetric mean absolute percentage error criteria. In most of the cases, the SVR and stacking-ensemble learning reach a better performance regarding adopted criteria than compared models. In general, the developed models can generate accurate forecasting, achieving errors in a range of 0.87%-3.51%, 1.02%-5.63%, and 0.95%-6.90% in one, three, and six-days-ahead, respectively. The ranking of models, from the best to the worst regarding accuracy, in all scenarios is SVR, stacking-ensemble learning, ARIMA, CUBIST, RIDGE, and RF models. The use of evaluated models is recommended to forecasting and monitor the ongoing growth of COVID-19 cases, once these models can assist the managers in the decision-making support systems.","Ribeiro, Matheus Henrique Dal Molin; da Silva, Ramon Gomes; Mariani, Viviana Cocco; Coelho, Leandro Dos Santos",Chaos Solitons Fractals,457,30

Adolescents have been especially affected with school closure and home confinement. The impact of the pandemic on sleep habits and quality of sleep and quality of life among adolescents have not been adequately characterized. We hypothesized that the COVID-19 pandemic induced an evening shift of the daily rhythm among adolescents and adversely affected sleep quality and quality of life of high school students. METHODS: Students were questioned about their usual bed and wake-up times and answered the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index Questionnaire (PSQI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the Morning-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire (WHOQOL) before and during the pandemic. RESULTS: Ninety-four students (64% females, aged 15+1 years) participated in both phases of the study. Students delayed bed and wake-up times in 1.5[0.5-2.0] and 2.0[1.5-2.5]h, respectively. Chronotype (MEQ) shifted towards eveningness during the pandemic. Sleep duration increased and quality of sleep (PSQI) improved only among those students with shorter sleep duration before the pandemic. During the pandemic, the physical and psychological domains of WHOQOL worsened but the environmental domain improved as compared to the study before the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: High school students delayed bed and wake-up times and shifted chronotype towards eveningness during the COVID-19 pandemic. The worsening of the physical and psychological WHOQOL domains and improvement of the environmental domain highlights the conflicting experiences that high school students are facing during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Genta, Felipe Dias; Rodrigues Neto, Guilherme Brito; Velletri Sunfeld, João Pedro; Porto, João Fabio; Xavier, Andressa Dallago; Moreno, Claudia R C; Lorenzi-Filho, Geraldo; Genta, Pedro Rodrigues",J. clin. sleep med,457,24

We aimed to determine the independent contribution of sex to stroke, myocardial infarction and death in the setting of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in a racially/ethnically diverse population. Clinical features, laboratory markers and clinical events were initially abstracted from medical records, with subsequent clinician adjudication. RESULTS: Of 2060 patients, myocardial injury (32% vs 23%, p = 0.019), acute myocardial infarction (2.7% vs 1.6%, p = 0.114), and ischemic stroke (1.8% vs 0.7%, p = 0.007) were more common in men vs women. In-hospital death occurred in 160 men (15%) vs 117 women (12%, p = 0.091). Men had higher odds of myocardial injury (odds ratio (OR) 2.04 [95% CI 1.43-2.91], p < 0.001), myocardial infarction (1.72 [95% CI 0.93-3.20], p = 0.085) and ischemic stroke (2.76 [95% CI 1.29-5.92], p = 0.009). Despite adjustment for demographics and cardiovascular risk factors, male sex predicted mortality (HR 1.33; 95% CI:1.01-1.74; p = 0.041). While men had significantly higher markers of inflammation, in sex-stratified analyses, increase in interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, ferritin and d-dimer were predictive of mortality and myocardial injury similarly in both sexes. CONCLUSIONS: Adjusted odds of myocardial injury, ischemic stroke and all-cause mortality, but not myocardial infarction, are significantly higher in men compared to women with COVID-19. Higher inflammatory markers are present in men but associated similarly with risk in both men and women. These data suggest that adverse cardiovascular outcomes in men vs. women are independent of cardiovascular comorbidities.","Minhas, Anum S; Shade, Julie K; Cho, Sung-Min; Michos, Erin D; Metkus, Thomas; Gilotra, Nisha A; Sharma, Garima; Trayanova, Natalia; Hays, Allison G",Int J Cardiol,457,16

While the initial target of SARS-CoV-2 is the respiratory tract, it is becoming increasingly clear that there is a complex interaction between the virus and the immune system ranging from mild to controlling responses to exuberant and dysfunctional multi-tissue directed autoimmune responses. The immune system plays a dual role in COVID-19, being implicated in both the anti-viral response and in the acute progression of the disease, with a dysregulated response represented by the marked cytokine release syndrome, macrophage activation, and systemic hyperinflammation. It has been speculated that these immunological changes may induce the loss of tolerance and/or trigger chronic inflammation. In particular, molecular mimicry, bystander activation and epitope spreading are well-established proposed mechanisms to explain this correlation with the likely contribution of HLA alleles. We performed a systematic literature review to evaluate the COVID-19-related autoimmune/rheumatic disorders reported between January and September 2020. In particular, we investigated the cases of incident hematological autoimmune manifestations, connective tissue diseases, antiphospholipid syndrome/antibodies, vasculitis, Kawasaki-like syndromes, acute arthritis, autoimmune-like skin lesions, and neurologic autoimmune conditions such as Guillain-Barré syndrome. We screened 6263 articles and report herein the findings of 382 select reports which allow us to conclude that there are 2 faces of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2, that include a benign virus controlling immune response and a many faceted range of dysregulated multi-tissue and organ directed autoimmune responses that provides a major challenge in the management of this viral disease. The number of cases for each disease varied significantly while there were no reported cases of adult onset Still disease, systemic sclerosis, or inflammatory myositis.","Novelli, Lucia; Motta, Francesca; De Santis, Maria; Ansari, Aftab A; Gershwin, M Eric; Selmi, Carlo",J Autoimmun,457,23

DESIGN/SETTING: Technical and nontechnical skill multiple mini-interviews (MMIs) were performed virtually and assessed for 109 applicants during virtual general surgery interviews over 2 days at a tertiary academic medical center. RESULTS: We demonstrate the feasibility of virtually assessing general surgery residency applicants' technical and non-technical skills. Using a virtual MMI format during general surgery interviews, we assessed communication, emotional intelligence, anatomical knowledge, interpretation of medical tests, knot tying, and suturing. Four tasks (communication, emotional intelligence , anatomical knowledge, and interpretation of tests) were assessed synchronously by trained general surgery interns. Applicants submitted a recording of themselves performing knot tying and suturing tasks, which were asynchronously assessed after the interview day. Applicants rated the MMI experience highly (4.3/5) via postinterview day survey and the majority of applicants felt that station objectives were met in the virtual format. CONCLUSIONS: We report a successful experience implementing technical and nontechnical virtual MMIs with capacity for 120 applicants during general surgery residency interviews. In the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic, the ability to assess surgical leaners virtually is essential. Virtual skills assessments may provide a more comprehensive picture of applicants and enable residency programs to better assess residents when gathering in person is not feasible.","Lund, Sarah; Shaikh, Nizamuddin; Yeh, Vicky J-H; Baloul, Mohamed; de Azevedo, Rafael; Peña, Alvaro; Becknell, Mark; Que, Florencia; Stulak, John; Rivera, Mariela",J. surg. educ,457,16

Case A 56 year-old male presented with exertional dyspnea, palpitations and bilateral hand arthralgias. Physical examination showed regular tachycardia, no jugular venous distension, clear lungs, no cardiac murmurs and skin thickening of digits of both hands. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. CXR showed bibasilar interstitial prominence. Laboratory studies showed troponin 0.15 ng/mL, normal BNP, WBC 2.27 K/uL and negative SARS-CoV2 PCR. 24 hours after admission, he developed sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia and hypotension, responding to amiodarone, lidocaine and IV fluids. Cardiac catheterization showed no CAD. CT chest showed no pulmonary embolism but lower lobe reticular, ground-glass opacities. Echocardiogram revealed moderate LV systolic dysfunction and inferolateral hypokinesis. Cardiac MRI showed similar wall motion abnormalities and diffuse sub-epicardial myocardial scar. Decision-making The patient was arrhythmia free on sotalol and carvedilol. Transbronchial lung biopsy was negative for sarcoidosis. Corticosteroids were started empirically. A defibrillator was placed for secondary prevention. Rheumatoid factor was negative, anti-CCP weakly positive (25 u), ANA &gt;1:320, ACE levels normal, ESR 69 mm/h, CRP 15.2. He was diagnosed with scleroderma and started on Cellcept. Three months after hospitalization, he is free of ventricular arrhythmias and arthralgias are improved Conclusion Cardiac involvement in autoimmune disease can lead to rhythm abnormalities and sudden cardiac death (1);it is often missed in scleroderma and if found, diagnosis is usually made more than one year after rheumatologic diagnosis (2). Autoimmune myocarditis (AM) is associated with poor prognosis (3). Early initiation of anti-arrhythmic agents, medical optimization for LV dysfunction, ICD placement and corticosteroids/immunosuppressants have benefited our patient. Early recognition of AM and multidisciplinary approach are imperative for successful outcome.","Simmonds, R. K.; Abuaisha, M.; Lavine, R.; Banbury, Z.; Basir, M.; Robertson, A.

Design: Study design was a retrospective single-center review of hospital data. Setting: The study was conducted at the COVID-19 Treatment Center of the Department of Medicine and Therapeutics of the Korle-Bu Teaching hospital in Accra, Ghana. Participants and study tools: A total of fifty patients with laboratory (rRT-PCR) confirmed COVID-19 infection were involved in the study. A chart review of the medical records of the patients was conducted and the data obtained was documented using a data extraction form. Results: The median age was 53 years and most (36% (18/50)) of the patients were at least 60 years of age. Eighty percent (40/50) of the patients were symptomatic, with cough and difficulty in breathing being the commonest presenting symptoms. The mean duration of hospitalization was 12.3 ± 7.3 days.

Here we show that the transcription factor Glis1 induces multi-level epigenetic and metabolic remodelling in stem cells that facilitates the induction of pluripotency. We find that Glis1 enables reprogramming of senescent cells into pluripotent cells and improves genome stability. During early phases of reprogramming, Glis1 directly binds to and opens chromatin at glycolytic genes, whereas it closes chromatin at somatic genes to upregulate glycolysis. Subsequently, higher glycolytic flux enhances cellular acetyl-CoA and lactate levels, thereby enhancing acetylation (H3K27Ac) and lactylation (H3K18la) at so-called 'second-wave' and pluripotency gene loci, opening them up to facilitate cellular reprogramming. Our work highlights Glis1 as a powerful reprogramming factor, and reveals an epigenome-metabolome-epigenome signalling cascade that involves the glycolysis-driven coordination of histone acetylation and lactylation in the context of cell fate determination.","Li, Linpeng; Chen, Keshi; Wang, Tianyu; Wu, Yi; Xing, Guangsuo; Chen, Mengqi; Hao, Zhihong; Zhang, Cheng; Zhang, Jinye; Ma, Bochao; Liu, Zihuang; Yuan, Hao; Liu, Zijian; Long, Qi; Zhou, Yanshuang; Qi, Juntao; Zhao, Danyun; Gao, Mi; Pei, Duanqing; Nie, Jinfu; Ye, Dan; Pan, Guangjin; Liu, Xingguo",,457,24

It is also intimately linked with the progression of COVID-19 disease as well as associated complications and mortality. Therefore, targeting the cytokine storm might help in reducing COVID-19-associated health complications. The number of COVID-associated deaths (as of January 15, 2021; https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) in the USA is high (1199/million) as compared to countries like India is low (110/million). Although the reason behind this is not clear, spices may have some role in explaining this difference. Spices and herbs are used in different traditional medicines, especially in countries such as India to treat various chronic diseases due to their potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. AIM: To evaluate the literature available on the anti-inflammatory properties of some spices which might prove beneficial in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 associated cytokine storm. METHOD: A detailed literature search has been conducted on PubMed for collecting information pertaining to the COVID-19; the history, origin, key structural features, and mechanism of infection of SARS-CoV-2; the repurposed drugs in use for the management of COVID-19 and the anti-inflammatory role of spices to combat COVID-19 associated cytokine storm. KEY FINDINGS: The literature search resulted in numerous in vitro, in vivo and clinical trials that have reported the potency of spices to exert anti-inflammatory effects by regulating crucial molecular targets for inflammation. SIGNIFICANCE: As spices are derived from Mother Nature and are inexpensive, they are relatively safer to consume. Therefore, their anti-inflammatory property can be exploited to combat the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients. This review thus focuses on the current knowledge on the role of spices for the treatment of COVID-19 through suppression of inflammation-linked cytokine storm.","Kunnumakkara, Ajaikumar B; Rana, Varsha; Parama, Dey; Banik, Kishore; Girisa, Sosmitha; Sahu, Henamayee; Thakur, Krishan Kumar; Dutta, Uma; Garodia, Prachi; Gupta, Subash C; Aggarwal, Bharat B",Life Sci,457,28

Newer research and old experience with other corona-viruses highlighted a probable underlying mechanism of disturbance of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that is associ-ated with intrinsic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. OBJECTIVE: In this review, we aimed to describe the intimate connections between the RAS components, the immune system and COVID-19 pathophysiology. METHODS: This non-systematic review article summarizes recent evidence on the relationship between COVID-19 and the RAS. RESULTS: Several studies have indicated that the downregulation of membrane-bound ACE2 may exert a key role for the impairment of immune functions and for COVID-19 patients' outcome. The downregulation may occur by distinct mecha-nisms, particularly: (1) the shedding process induced by SARS-CoV-2 fusion pathway, which reduces the amount of mem-brane-bound ACE2, stimulating more shedding by the high levels of Angiotensin II; (2) the endocytosis of ACE2 receptor with the virus itself and (3) by the interferon inhibition caused by SARS-CoV-2 effects on immune system, which leads to reduction of ACE2 receptor expression. CONCLUSION: Recent research provides evidence of a reduction of the components of the alternative RAS axis, including ACE2 and Angiotensin-(1-7). In contrast, increased levels of Angiotensin II can activate the AT1 receptor in several organs. Consequently, increased inflammation, thrombosis and angiogenesis occur in patients infected with SARS-COV-2. Atten-tion should be paid to the interactions of the RAS and COVID-19, mainly in the context of novel vaccines and proposed medications.","Vieira, Cristina; Nery, Lucas; Martins, Ludimila; Jabour, Luiz; Dias, Raphael; Simões E Silva, Ana Cristina",,457,6

É importante que haja estudos sobre esse gene e possíveis mutações que possam levar a alterações na estrutura e função da proteína. Os objetivos desse estudo foram caracterizar o gene floR em isolados de Aeromonas spp. obtidas do Vale do São Francisco e verificar se a presença desse gene está associada com a resistência ao florfenicol. Foram realizadas reações em cadeia da polimerase (PCR) para a presença do gene floR em 27 isolados de Aeromonas spp.. Amostras positivas para a presença do gene foram sequenciadas e analisadas quanto à presença de polimorfismos por meio de alinhamentos. Os diferentes haplótipos detectados foram utilizados para análises com os programas SIFT e PolyPhen para predição de alteração de função proteica. A modelagem estrutural da proteina codificada pelo gene floR foi realizada com o programa Modeller e, os modelos foram avaliados pelo Procheck, Verify3D e Whatif. A similaridade da estrutura tridimensional da proteína referência com as estruturas tridimensionais das proteínas codificadas pelos diferentes haplótipos foi comparada através do TM-align.

This Rostrum examines the actual risk of in-person learning among children with asthma during novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the discrepancy between perceived and actual risk, the contributing factors to this discrepancy, and possible solutions to narrow this divide. Overall, the evidence does not support that children with asthma are at an increased risk of COVID-19 morbidity or mortality compared with children without asthma. Asthma medications do not appear to contribute to incidence or severity of COVID-19 disease. However, there is a high perceived risk of in-person learning that is partially related to how it is portrayed in the media. There is little guidance regarding transitioning asthmatic children back to school and how to properly counsel on mediation of risk. There are differences regionally and locally around school reopening, exemptions, and their implementation. To narrow the divide between perceived and actual risk, clear consistent and ongoing communication will be necessary.","Abrams, Elissa M; Shaker, Marcus; Greenhawt, Matthew",J. Allergy Clin. Immunol.

For this reason, the use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) was considered to be an ideal protective strategy, given its reliance on very low tidal volumes cycled at very high rates. However, results from clinical trials in adults with ARDS have demonstrated that HFOV does not improve clinical outcomes. Recent experimental and computational studies have shown that oscillation of a mechanically heterogeneous lung with multiple simultaneous frequencies can reduce parenchymal strain, improve gas exchange, and maintain lung recruitment at lower distending pressures compared to traditional ""single-frequency"" HFOV. This review will discuss the theoretical rationale for the use of multiple oscillatory frequencies in ARDS, as well as the mechanisms by which it may reduce the risk for ventilator-induced lung injury.","Kaczka, David W",,457,26

Beside the key consideration of the patient’s interests, small animal veterinarians are often challenged to consider not only client’s emotional needs, but also their own personal aspirations to provide quality patient care and to make a good living as a professional. Further, veterinarians have an interest in continuous professional development and the use of the newest treatments, which may influence their decision-making process. Based on published work, we hypothesize the existence of four decision ethics orientations that veterinarians can use to manage potentially conflicting concerns. These are: the patient-focused, the client-empathetic, the client-devolved and the development-oriented decision ethics orientations. We surveyed small animal veterinarians in Austria, Denmark, and the UK using a questionnaire (N = 648), and successfully identified the four decision ethics orientations in all three countries. The patient-focused and client-empathetic decision ethics orientations are salient in all countries, whereas Danish and UK veterinarians are slightly more client-empathetic and client-devolved compared to their Austrian colleagues. Across countries our findings show that experienced and older veterinarians tend to be more client-empathetic. Younger and less experienced professionals are more development-oriented compared to their older and more experienced colleagues. In contrast to other studies investigating ethical issues in small animal practice, we found no evidence that gender plays a decisive role in the tendency towards any decision ethics orientation. We also show that veterinarians with a higher client-empathetic orientation and development-orientation more often discuss the possibility of health insurance with clients who do not have it. The present study provides a first empirical insight into how veterinarians manage challenging expectations and ethical concerns as part of decision making in modern small animal practice.","Springer, Svenja; Sandøe, Peter; Grimm, Herwig; Corr, Sandra A.; Kristensen, Annemarie T.; Lund, Thomas Bøker",PLoS One,457,16

It shares homology with SARS and MERS-CoV, responsible for past outbreaks in China and in Middle East. SARS-CoV2 spread from China where the first infections were described in December 2019 and is responsible for the respiratory symptoms that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome. A cytokine storm has been shown in patients who develop fatal complications, as observed in past coronavirus infections. The management includes ventilatory support and broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, empirically utilized, as a targeted therapy and vaccines have not been developed. Based upon our limited knowledge on the pathogenesis of CoViD-19, a potential role of some anti-rheumatic drugs may be hypothesized, acting as direct antivirals or targeting host immune response. Antimalarial drugs, commonly used in rheumatology, may alter the lysosomal proteases that mediates the viral entry into the cell and have demonstrated efficacy in improving the infection. Anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6 may interfere with the cytokine storm in severe cases and use of tocilizumab has shown good outcomes in a small cohort. Baricitinib has both antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. Checkpoints inhibitors such as anti-CD200 and anti-PD1 could have a role in the treatment of CoViD-19. Rheumatic disease patients taking immunosuppressive drugs should be recommended to maintain the chronic therapy, prevent infection by avoiding social contacts and pausing immunosuppressants in case of infection.

However, the transmission of its pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is not fully clear. It is still controversial whether the ocular transmission of SARS-CoV-2 exists. This review aimed to summarize the evidence of SARS-CoV-2 ocular transmission. METHODS: Online articles were searched till October 23, 2020 in Pubmed, Embase, and websites of World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19, American Academy of Ophthalmology, and American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery under the search strategy of ((((“COVID-19”[Mesh]) OR (“SARS-CoV-2”[Mesh])) OR (2019 novel coronavirus)) OR (2019-nCoV)) AND ((((“Conjunctivitis”[Mesh]) OR (Ocular Surface)) OR (“Eye”[Mesh])) OR (“Ophthalmology”[Mesh])). The language was not restricted. After screening, 1445 records were excluded and 168 references original articles were finally included. RESULTS: Cells of ocular surface express both the receptor of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), offering molecular bases for the ocular susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. Accumulated COVID-19 patients presented conjunctivitis as the initial or the only symptom. Whether COVID-19 patients had ocular symptoms or not, SARS-CoV-2 was detectable on the ocular surface, and the isolated virus was infectious, proving that the ocular surface can not only be a reservoir but also a source of contagion. SARS-CoV-2 may reach the ocular surface by hand-eye contact and aerosols. Once SARS-CoV-2 reaches the ocular surface, it may transfer to other systems through the nasolacrimal system or hematogenous metastasis. CONCLUSION: The ocular surface can serve as a reservoir and source of contagion for SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted to the ocular surface through hand-eye contact and aerosols, and then transfer to other systems through nasolacrimal route and hematogenous metastasis. The possibility of ocular transmission of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be ignored.","Qu, Jing-Yu; Xie, Hua-Tao; Zhang, Ming-Chang",Clin Ophthalmol,457,29

METHODS: A prospective online survey was sent out to 4234 surgeons of the AGA - Society of Arthroscopy and Joint-Surgery (Gesellschaft für Arthroskopie und Gelenkchirurgie, AGA). The survey was created using SurveyMonkey software and consisted of 23 questions relating to the reduction of orthopaedic services at the participating centres and the impact that the pandemic is having on each surgeon. RESULTS: A total of 890 orthopaedic surgeons responded to the online survey. Approximately 90% of them experienced a reduction in their surgical caseload and patient contact. 38.7% stated that their institutions returned to providing diagnostic arthroscopies. 54.5% reported that they went back to performing anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions (ACLR), 62.6% were performing arthroscopic meniscus procedures, and 55.8% had resumed performing shoulder arthroscopy. Only 31.9% of the surgeons were able to perform elective total joint arthroplasty. 60% of the participants stated that they had suffered substantial financial loss due to the pandemic. CONCLUSION: A gradual resumption of orthopaedic health-care services was observed in May 2020. Typical orthopaedic surgical procedures like ACLR, shoulder arthroscopy and elective total joint arthroplasty were reported to be currently performed by 54%, 56% and 32% of surgeons, respectively.

Previously, we demonstrated that in the related cardiovirus, Encephalomyocarditis virus, a programmed −1 ribosomal frameshift (−1 PRF) occurs at a conserved G_GUU_UUU sequence within the 2B-encoding region of the polyprotein open reading frame (ORF). Here we show that −1 PRF occurs at a similar site during translation of the TMEV genome. In addition, we demonstrate that a predicted 3′ RNA stem-loop structure at a noncanonical spacing downstream of the shift site is required for efficient frameshifting in TMEV and that frameshifting also requires virus infection. Mutating the G_GUU_UUU shift site to inhibit frameshifting results in an attenuated virus with reduced growth kinetics and a small-plaque phenotype. Frameshifting in the virus context was found to be extremely efficient at 74 to 82%, which, to our knowledge, is the highest frameshifting efficiency recorded to date for any virus. We propose that highly efficient −1 PRF in TMEV provides a mechanism to escape the confines of equimolar expression normally inherent in the single-polyprotein expression strategy of picornaviruses. IMPORTANCE Many viruses utilize programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting (−1 PRF) to produce different protein products at a defined ratio, or to translate overlapping ORFs to increase coding capacity. With few exceptions, −1 PRF occurs on specific “slippery” heptanucleotide sequences and is stimulated by RNA structure beginning 5 to 9 nucleotides (nt) downstream of the slippery site. Here we describe an unusual case of −1 PRF in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) that is extraordinarily efficient (74 to 82% of ribosomes shift into the alternative reading frame) and, in stark contrast to other examples of −1 PRF, is dependent upon a stem-loop structure beginning 14 nt downstream of the slippery site. Furthermore, in TMEV-based reporter constructs in transfected cells, efficient frameshifting is critically dependent upon virus infection. We suggest that TMEV evolved frameshifting as a novel mechanism for removing ribosomes from the message (a “ribosome sink”) to downregulate synthesis of the 3′-encoded replication proteins.","Finch, Leanne K.; Ling, Roger; Napthine, Sawsan; Olspert, Allan; Michiels, Thomas; Lardinois, Cécile; Bell, Susanne; Loughran, Gary; Brierley, Ian; Firth, Andrew E.",J Virol,457,13

In mammalian cells, stress signaling usually leads to either cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis, depending on the severity of the insult and the ability of the cell to recover. Stress also often leads to reorganization of nuclear architecture, reflecting the simultaneous inhibition of major nuclear pathways (e.g., replication and transcription) and activation of specific stress responses (e.g., DNA repair). In this review, we focus on how two nuclear organelles, the nucleolus and the Cajal body, respond to stress. The nucleolus senses stress and is a central hub for coordinating the stress response. We review nucleolar function in the stress-induced regulation of p53 and the specific changes in nucleolar morphology and composition that occur upon stress.

Early detection of COVID-19 may protect many infected people. Unfortunately, COVID-19 can be mistakenly diagnosed as pneumonia or lung cancer, which with fast spread in the chest cells, can lead to patient death. The most commonly used diagnosis methods for these three diseases are chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images. In this paper, a multi-classification deep learning model for diagnosing COVID-19, pneumonia, and lung cancer from a combination of chest x-ray and CT images is proposed. This combination has been used because chest X-ray is less powerful in the early stages of the disease, while a CT scan of the chest is useful even before symptoms appear, and CT can precisely detect the abnormal features that are identified in images. In addition, using these two types of images will increase the dataset size, which will increase the classification accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no other deep learning model choosing between these diseases is found in the literature. In the present work, the performance of four architectures are considered, namely: VGG19-CNN, ResNet152V2, ResNet152V2 + Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and ResNet152V2 + Bidirectional GRU (Bi-GRU). A comprehensive evaluation of different deep learning architectures is provided using public digital chest x-ray and CT datasets with four classes (i.e., Normal, COVID-19, Pneumonia, and Lung cancer). From the results of the experiments, it was found that the VGG19 +CNN model outperforms the three other proposed models.

This involves a bridge between innate and adaptive immune systems, wherein antibodies form immune complexes that drive numerous innate immune effector functions, including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent complement-mediated lysis, and antibody-dependent phagocytosis. Here, we review certain mechanisms that modulate these antibody-mediated effector functions against virally infected cells, such as viral glycoprotein shedding, viral glycoprotein internalization, antibody cooperativity, and antibody glycosylation.

Lockdowns, an epidemiological measure, have made it difficult for oncologists to provide care. In this study, we analysed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Croatian cancer care. METHODS: This was a multicentre cross-sectional observational study of 422 patients who received systemic oncology therapy during the pandemic. The patients completed a survey to capture their views on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their cancer care. Univariate descriptive and bivariate analyses were performed to analyse the relationship between the patients’ perspective on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer care and the quality of Croatian cancer care and their clinical and sociodemographic data. RESULTS: Discontinuation or change in cancer treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic was observed in 10.2% of cases. Most did not change their place of treatment owing to the lockdown (97.6%). 14.7% of the patients felt that the quality of cancer care received had changed during the pandemic.

However, 25% of patients with cancer reported that the pandemic affected cancer treatment and the quality of cancer care.","Kelemenic-Drazin, Renata; Budisavljevic, Anuska; Plavetic, Natalija Dedic; Fucak, Iva Kardum; Silovski, Tajana; Dobric, Vesna Telesmanic; Nalbani, Mario; Curic, Zvonimir; Boric-Mikez, Zvjezdana; Ladenhauser, Tatjana; Trivanovic, Dragan; Vojnovic, Zeljko; Tomas, Ilijan; Plestina, Stjepko",Ecancermedicalscience,457,16

Scanning electron microscopy investigation shows the formation of Ag/Au alloys particles during irradiation of Ag–Au bilayer deposited on FTO (SnO(2):F) substrate by laser fluency equal to 0.5 J/cm(2) or 1.0 J/cm(2) with 12 ns laser pulse duration. The dealloying process of these Au–Ag alloy particles leads to the formation of Au nanoporous particles. The obtained nanostructures were studied with SERS and revealed a promising enhancement factor in porous Au nanostructure and tunability of localized surface plasmon resonance. The highly dense strong hot spots and large specific area in porous structure of gold nanostructures is the origin of the highly enhancement factor observed experimentally and theoretically. A very good agreement between simulation and experimental results was found confirming the potential of Au/Ag alloys and particularly porous gold nanostructure in SERS application.,"Awada, C.; Dab, C.; Grimaldi, M.

670069,670069,670069,Letter from the editor.,9.757231,4.881924,2021-05-04,"The key idea behind the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is that, as people age, they are more likely to have things wrong with them. Those things they have wrong (health deficits) can, as they accumulate, erode their ability to do the high order functions which define their overall health. These high order functions include being able to: think and do as they please; look after themselves; interact with other people; and move about without falling. The Clinical Frailty Scale brings that information together in one place. This paper is a guide for people new to the Clinical Frailty Scale. It also introduces an updated version (CFS version 2.0), with revised level names (e.g., “vulnerable” becomes “living with very mild frailty”) and minor edits to level descriptions. The key points discussed are that the Clinical Frailty Scale assays the baseline state, it is not widely validated in younger people or those with stable single-system disabilities, and it requires clinical judgement. The Clinical Frailty Scale is now commonly used as a triage tool to make important clinical decisions such as allocating scarce health care resources for COVID-19 management; therefore, it is important that the scale is used appropriately.","Rockwood, Kenneth; Theou, Olga",Can Geriatr J,457,5

One potential means to provide care while avoiding unnecessary person‐to‐person contact is to offer remote services (telemedicine). This study aimed to (1) gather real‐time information on the use and perception of telemedicine in people living with type 1 diabetes and (2) assess the challenges, such as restricted access to health care and/or medical supplies. METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was widely distributed between 24 March and 5 May 2020 using an open‐access web‐based platform. Data were analysed descriptively, and results were stratified according to age, sex and HbA(1c). RESULTS: There were 7477 survey responses from individuals in 89 countries. Globally, 30% reported that the pandemic had affected their healthcare access due to cancelled physical appointments with their healthcare providers. Thirty‐two per cent reported no fundamental change in their medical follow‐up during this period, with 9% stating that no personal contact was established with their doctors over the duration of the study. Twenty‐eight per cent received remote care through telephone (72%) or video‐calls (28%). Of these, 86% found remote appointments useful and 75% plan to have remote appointments in the future. Glucose control, indicated by HbA(1c), was positively associated with positive perception of telemedicine. In males, 45% of respondents with an HbA(1c) > 9% rated telemedicine not useful compared to those with lower HbA(1c,) while 20% of females with an HbA(1c) > 9% rated it not useful (χ(2) = 14.2, P = .0016). CONCLUSION: Remote appointments have largely been perceived as positive in people with type 1 diabetes with the majority (75%) stating that they would consider remote appointments beyond the pandemic. Age and level of education do not appear to influence perception of telemedicine, whereas poor glucose control, particularly in males, seems to negatively affect perception.","Scott, Sam N.; Fontana, Federico Y.; Züger, Thomas; Laimer, Markus; Stettler, Christoph",Endocrinol Diabetes Metab,457,1
