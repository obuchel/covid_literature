1162,Nanorobot Hardware Architecture for Medical Defense,2008-05-06,"This work presents a new approach with details on the integrated platform and hardware architecture for nanorobots application in epidemic control, which should enable real time in vivo prognosis of biohazard infection. The recent developments in the field of nanoelectronics, with transducers progressively shrinking down to smaller sizes through nanotechnology and carbon nanotubes, are expected to result in innovative biomedical instrumentation possibilities, with new therapies and efficient diagnosis methodologies. The use of integrated systems, smart biosensors, and programmable nanodevices are advancing nanoelectronics, enabling the progressive research and development of molecular machines. It should provide high precision pervasive biomedical monitoring with real time data transmission. The use of nanobioelectronics as embedded systems is the natural pathway towards manufacturing methodology to achieve nanorobot applications out of laboratories sooner as possible. To demonstrate the practical application of medical nanorobotics, a 3D simulation based on clinical data addresses how to integrate communication with nanorobots using RFID, mobile phones, and satellites, applied to long distance ubiquitous surveillance and health monitoring for troops in conflict zones. Therefore, the current model can also be used to prevent and save a population against the case of some targeted epidemic disease.","Cavalcanti, Adriano; Shirinzadeh, Bijan; Zhang, Mingjun; Kretly, Luiz C.",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3675524/,269
3303,Mapping Oil Spills from Dual-Polarized SAR Images Using an Artificial Neural Network: Application to Oil Spill in the Kerch Strait in November 2007,2018-07-11,"Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been widely used to detect oil-spill areas through the backscattering intensity difference between oil and background pixels. However, since the signal is similar to that produced by other phenomena, positive identification can be challenging. In this study we developed an algorithm to effectively analyze large-scale oil spill areas in SAR images by focusing on optimizing the input layer to artificial neural network (ANN) through removal the factor of lowering the accuracy. An ANN algorithm was used to generate probability maps of oil spills. Highly accurate pixel-based data processing was conducted through false or un-detection element reduction by normalizing the image or applying a non-local (NL) means filter and median filter to the input neurons for ANN. In addition, the standard deviation of co-polarized phase difference (CPD) was used to reduce false detection from the look-alike with weak damping effect. The algorithm was validated using TerraSAR-X images of an oil spill caused by stranded oil tanker Volganefti-139 in the Kerch Strait in 2007. According to the validation results of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the oil spill was detected with an accuracy of about 95.19% and un-detection or false detection by look-alike and speckle noise was greatly reduced.","Kim, Daeseong; Jung, Hyung-Sup",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6069476/,269

10916,Spontaneous repulsion in the [Formula: see text] reaction on coupled networks,2018-04-04,"Two node variables determine the evolution of cascades in random networks: a node's degree and threshold. Correlations between both fundamentally change the robustness of a network, yet they are disregarded in standard analytic methods as local tree or heterogeneous mean field approximations, since order statistics are difficult to capture analytically because of their combinatorial nature. We show how they become tractable in the thermodynamic limit of infinite network size. This enables the analytic description of node attacks that are characterized by threshold allocations based on node degree. Using two examples, we discuss possible implications of irregular phase transitions and different speeds of cascade evolution for the control of cascades.","Burkholz, Rebekka; Schweitzer, Frank",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217536/,269
11381,"Development of eco-friendly, self-cleaning, antibacterial membrane for the elimination of chromium (VI) from tannery wastewater",2020-04-29,"INTRODUCTION: The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and visual inspection of pupillary function are routine measures to monitor patients with impaired consciousness and predict their outcome in the neurointensive care unit (neuro-ICU). Our aim was to compare more recent measures, i.e. FOUR score and automated pupillometry, to standard monitoring with the GCS and visual inspection of pupils. METHODS: Supervised trained nursing staff examined a consecutive sample of patients admitted to the neuro-ICU of a tertiary referral centre using GCS and FOUR score and assessing pupillary function first by visual inspection and then by automated pupillometry. Clinical outcome was evaluated 6 months after admission using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended. RESULTS: Fifty-six consecutive patients (median age 63 years) were assessed a total of 234 times. Of the 36 patients with at least one GCS score of 3, 13 had a favourable outcome. All seven patients with at least one FOUR score of ≤ 3 had an unfavourable outcome, which was best predicted by a low “brainstem” sub-score. Compared to automated pupillometry, visual assessment underestimated pupillary diameters (median difference, 0.4 mm; P = 0.006). Automated pupillometry detected a preserved pupillary light reflex in 10 patients, in whom visual inspection had missed pupillary constriction. DISCUSSION: Training of nursing staff to implement frequent monitoring of patients in the neuro-ICU with FOUR score and automated pupillometry is feasible. Both measures provide additional clinical information compared to the GCS and visual assessment of pupillary function, most importantly a more granular classification of patients with low levels of consciousness by the FOUR score.","Olsen, Markus Harboe; Jensen, Helene Ravnholt; Ebdrup, Søren Røddik; Topp, Nina Hvid; Strange, Ditte Gry; Møller, Kirsten; Kondziella, Daniel",Acta Neurochir (Wien),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223804/,269

First, the framing of this issue is vitally important. Second, police-involved fatalities represent a nonrandom sample of all incidents involving police use of deadly force (i.e., physical force that causes or is likely to cause death), and unfortunately, we lack comprehensive data on use of deadly force that does not result in fatalities. Finally, to make sense of who is killed by the police, researchers must also identify who was exposed to the risk of being killed by the police.","Nix, Justin",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7386827/,269
13404,Does the size of rewards influence performance in cognitively demanding tasks?,2020-10-21,"PURPOSE: The proportion of geriatric trauma patients (GTPs) (age ≥ 65 years old) with chest wall injury undergoing surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) nationally is unknown. We hypothesize a growing trend of GTPs undergoing SSRF, and sought to evaluate risk of respiratory complications and mortality for GTPs compared to younger adults (18–64 years old) undergoing SSRF. METHODS: The Trauma Quality Improvement Program (2010–2016) was queried for patients with rib fracture(s) who underwent SSRF. GTPs were compared to younger adults. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: From 21,517 patients undergoing SSRF, 3,001 (16.2%) were GTPs. Of all patients undergoing SSRF in 2010, 10.6% occurred on GTPs increasing to 17.9% in 2016 (p < 0.001) with a geometric-mean-annual increase of 11.5%. GTPs had a lower median injury severity score (18 vs. 22, p < 0.001), but had a higher rate of mortality (4.7% vs. 1.2%, p < 0.001). After controlling for covariates, GTPs had an increased associated risk of mortality (OR 4.80, CI 3.62–6.36, p < 0.001). On a separate multivariate analysis for all trauma patients with isolated chest Abbreviated Injury Scale 3, GTPs were associated with a similar four-fold risk of mortality (OR 4.21, CI 1.98–6.32, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Spanning 7 years of data, the proportion of GTPs undergoing SSRF increased by over 7%. Although GTPs undergoing SSRF had lesser injuries, their risk of mortality was four times higher than other adult trauma patients undergoing SSRF, which was similar to their increased background risk of mortality. Ultimately, SSRF in GTPs should be considered on an individualized basis with careful attention to risk–benefit ratio.

13524,Analyzing Malaria Disease Using Effective Deep Learning Approach,2020-09-24,"Piscine reovirus (PRV) is the causative agent of heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI), which is detrimental to Atlantic Salmon (AS) aquaculture, but so far has not been cultivatable, which impedes studying the disease and developing a vaccine. Homogenates of head kidney and red blood cells (RBC) from AS in which PRV-1 had been detected were applied to fish cell lines. The cell lines were from embryos, and from brain, blood, fin, gill, gonads, gut, heart, kidney, liver, skin, and spleen, and had the shapes of endothelial, epithelial, fibroblast, and macrophage cells. Most cell lines were derived from the Neopterygii subclass of fish, but one was from subclass Chondrostei. Cultures were examined by phase contrast microscopy for appearance, and by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for PRV-1 RNA amplification and for the capacity to transfer any changes to new cultures. No changes in appearance and Ct values were observed consistently or transferable to new cultures. Therefore, 31 cell lines examined were unable to support PRV-1 amplification and are described as belonging to the non-supportive PRV-1 invitrome. However, these investigations and cell lines can contribute to understanding PRV-1 cellular and host tropism, and the interactions between virus-infected and bystander cells.","Pham, Phuc H.; Misk, Ehab; Papazotos, Fotini; Jones, Ginny; Polinski, Mark P.; Contador, Elena; Russell, Spencer; Garver, Kyle A.; Lumsden, John S.; Bols, Niels C.",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7601784/,269
14276,A Design of the Resilient Enterprise: A Reference Architecture for Emergent Behaviors Control,2020-11-21,"Enteroviruses infect gastrointestinal epithelium cells, cause multiple human diseases, and present public health risks worldwide. However, the mechanisms underlying host immune responses in intestinal mucosa against the early enterovirus infections remain elusive. Here, we showed that human enteroviruses including enterovirus 71 (EV71), coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), and poliovirus 1 (PV1) predominantly induce type III interferons (IFN-λ1 and IFN-λ2/3), rather than type I interferons (IFN-α and IFN-β), in cultured human normal and cancerous intestine epithelial cells (IECs), mouse intestine tissues, and human clinical intestine specimens. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that IFN-λ production is induced upon enterovirus infection through the Toll-like receptor 3/interferon regulatory factor 1 (TLR3/IRF1) signaling pathway in IECs. In turn, the supplementation of IFN-λ subsequently induces intrinsically antiviral responses against enterovirus replication. Notably, intraperitoneal injection in neonatal C57BL/6J mice with mouse recombinant IFN-λ2 protein represses EV71 replication and protects mice from viral lethal effects. Altogether, these results revealed a distinct mechanism by which the host elicited immune responses against enterovirus infections in intestine through activating the TLR3/IRF1/type III IFN axis. The new findings would provide an antiviral strategy for the prevention and treatment of enterovirus infections and associated diseases.","Su, Rui; Shereen, Muhammad Adnan; Zeng, Xiaofeng; Liang, Yicong; Li, Wen; Ruan, Zhihui; Li, Yongkui; Liu, Weiyong; Liu, Yingle; Wu, Kailang; Luo, Zhen; Wu, Jianguo",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7683398/,269

14537,Derivation of Respiratory Metrics in Health and Asthma,2020-12-12,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The role of wildlife animals, such as macaques and bats, in the spreading and maintenance of deadly zoonotic pathogens in nature are documented in several studies. The present study substantially highlights the first evidence of West Nile Virus (WNV) infection, a mosquito borne virus in the Malaysian macaques and bats. Of the 81 macaques sampled, 24 of the long-tailed macaques were seropositive to WNV, indicating that they were exposed to the virus in the past. The long-tailed macaques were found in the mangrove forests located in the Central, Southern, and West Peninsular Malaysia. Meanwhile, five out of 41 bats (Lesser Short-nosed Fruit Bats, Lesser Sheath-tailed Bats, and Thai Horseshoe Bats) that were found in the caves from Northern Peninsular Malaysia showed susceptibility to WNV. Therefore, a constant bio surveillance of WNV in the wildlife in Malaysia is a proactive attempt. This study was aligned with the Malaysian government’s mission under the Malaysia Strategy for Emerging Diseases and Public Health Emergencies (MYSED) II (2017–2021) and the Ministry of Health priorities in order to enhance the regional capability to rapidly and accurately survey, detect, diagnose, and report outbreaks of pathogens and diseases of security concern. ABSTRACT: The role of wildlife such as wild birds, macaques, and bats in the spreading and maintenance of deadly zoonotic pathogens in nature have been well documented in many parts of the world. One such pathogen is the mosquitoes borne virus, namely the West Nile Virus (WNV). Previous research has shown that 1:7 and 1:6 Malaysian wild birds are WNV antibody and RNA positive, respectively, and bats in North America may not be susceptible to the WNV infection. This study was conducted to determine the status of WNV in Malaysian macaques and bats found in mangrove forests and caves, respectively. Archive sera and oropharyngeal swabs from long-tailed macaques were subjected to the antibody detection using WNV competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA) and WNV RNA using RT-PCR, respectively, while the archive oropharyngeal and rectal swabs from bats were subjected to RT-PCR without serological analysis due to the unavailability of serum samples. The analysis revealed a WNV seropositivity of 29.63% (24/81) and none of the macaques were positive for WNV RNA. Meanwhile, 12.2% (5/41) of the bats from Pteropodidae, Emballonuridae, and Rhinolophidae families tested positive for WNV RNA. Here, we show a high WNV antibody prevalence in macaques and a moderate WNV RNA in various Malaysian bat species, suggesting that WNV circulates through Malaysian wild animals and Malaysian bat species may be susceptible to the WNV infection.","Ain-Najwa, Mohd Yuseri; Yasmin, Abd Rahaman; Arshad, Siti Suri; Omar, Abdul Rahman; Abu, Jalila; Kumar, Kiven; Mohammed, Hussni Omar; Natasha, Jafar Ali; Mohammed, Mohammed Nma; Bande, Faruku; Abdullah, Mohd-Lutfi; J.

However, data are limited about people's knowledge, attitudes, and practices. OBJECTIVE: To determine knowledge about COVID-19, attitudes towards presidential directives and Ministry of Health (MoH) guidelines, and adherence to practicing public health preventive measures (KAP) in Uganda. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was conducted between April 28 and May 19, 2020. Data were collected using online social media platforms, websites, and popular media outlets. We descriptively summarized data and categorized KAP scores as knowledgeable about COVID-19, positive attitude towards presidential directives and MoH guidelines, and adherent to public health preventive measures, respectively. We tested sex differences in KAP using tests of significance and established independently associated factors using modified Poisson regression analysis, reported using adjusted prevalence risk ratio (aPR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: We studied 362 participants with the following sociodemographic characteristics: 86 (23.8%) aged 25-29 years, 212 (58.6%) males, 270 (74.6%) with tertiary or university levels of education, and 268 (74.0%) urban residents. Of the 362 participants, 264 (93.9%) were knowledgeable about COVID-19 (94.1% males and 93.8% females), 51.3% had positive attitudes towards presidential directives and MoH guidelines (51.0% male and 51.8% female), and 175 (48.3%) were adherent to practicing public health preventive measures (42.9% males and 56.0% females). Compared to males, our data shows that females were more adherent to practicing public health preventive measures (aPR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.01-1.53), knowledgeable about COVID-19 (aPR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.95-1.07), and had positive attitudes towards directives and guidelines (aPR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.82-1.25). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that public health prevention efforts should be directed to closing the identified gaps in KAP among Ugandans in order to halt the spread of COVD-19 in Uganda as well as the East African region.","Okello, Gerald; Izudi, Jonathan; Teguzirigwa, Steven; Kakinda, Allan; Van Hal, Guido",Biomed Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7729389/,269

15228,Multi-Block Color-Binarized Statistical Images for Single-Sample Face Recognition,2021-01-21,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Measles virus is currently under investigation as an innovative cancer treatment. The virus selectively replicates in and kills cancer cells. Furthermore, it can be genetically engineered to increase tumor specificity and therapeutic efficacy. Importantly, treatment with measles virus activates antitumor immune responses. A number of clinical trials using measles virus for cancer treatment have been completed or are ongoing. Future studies will further harness the possibilities of virus engineering and potential of combination immunotherapies to improve clinical outcome. ABSTRACT: Measles virus (MeV) preferentially replicates in malignant cells, leading to tumor lysis and priming of antitumor immunity. Live attenuated MeV vaccine strains are therefore under investigation as cancer therapeutics. The versatile MeV reverse genetics systems allows for engineering of advanced targeted, armed, and shielded oncolytic viral vectors. Therapeutic efficacy can further be enhanced by combination treatments. An emerging focus in this regard is combination immunotherapy, especially with immune checkpoint blockade. Despite challenges arising from antiviral immunity, availability of preclinical models, and GMP production, early clinical trials have demonstrated safety of oncolytic MeV and yielded promising efficacy data. Future clinical trials with engineered viruses, rational combination regimens, and comprehensive translational research programs will realize the potential of oncolytic immunotherapy.","Engeland, Christine E.; Ungerechts, Guy",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7867054/,269

Accurate and rapid detection of these viral pathogens helps to reduce losses and prevent virus spread. Current molecular detection assays used for apple viruses require specialized and expensive equipment. Here, we optimized a CRISPR/Cas12a‐based nucleic acid detection platform for the diagnosis of the most prevalent RNA viruses/viroid in apple, namely Apple necrotic mosaic virus (ApNMV), Apple stem pitting virus (ASPV), Apple stem grooving virus (ASGV), Apple chlorotic leaf spot virus (ACLSV) and Apple scar skin viroid (ASSVd). We detected each RNA virus/viroid directly from crude leaf extracts after simultaneous multiplex reverse transcription‐recombinase polymerase amplification (RT‐RPA) with high specificity. Positive results can be distinguished by the naked eye via oligonucleotide‐conjugated gold nanoparticles. The CRISPR/Cas12a‐RT‐RPA platform exhibited comparable sensitivity to RT‐qPCR, with limits of detection reaching 250 viral copies per reaction for ASPV and ASGV and 2500 copies for the others. However, this protocol was faster and simpler, requiring an hour or less from leaf harvest. Field tests showed 100% agreement with RT‐PCR detection for 52 samples. This novel Cas12a‐based method is ideal for rapid and reliable detection of apple viruses in the orchard without the need to send samples to a specialized laboratory.","Jiao, Jian; Kong, Kangkang; Han, Jinmeng; Song, Shangwei; Bai, Tuanhui; Song, Chunhui; Wang, Miaomiao; Yan, Zhenli; Zhang, Hengtao; Zhang, Ruiping; Feng, Jiancan; Zheng, Xianbo",Plant Biotechnol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7868969/,269

Examining the impact of land use/land cover (LULC) on aerosol optical depth (AOD) helps to understand how human activities influence air quality and develop suitable solutions. The Landsat 8 image and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol products in summer in 2018 were used in LULC classification and AOD retrieval in this study. Spatial statistics and correlation analysis about the relationship between LULC and AOD were performed to examine the impact of LULC on AOD in summer in Wuhan, China. Results indicate that the AOD distribution expressed an obvious “basin effect” in urban development areas: higher AOD values concentrated in water bodies with lower terrain, which were surrounded by the high buildings or mountains with lower AOD values. The AOD values were negatively correlated with the vegetated areas while positively correlated to water bodies and construction lands. The impact of LULC on AOD varied with different contexts in all cases, showing a “context effect”. The regression correlations among the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and AOD in given landscape contexts were much stronger than those throughout the whole study area.

One practical and efficient way to address them is to replace fossil-based plastics with natural-based materials, such as cellulose. The applications of different cellulose products have recently received increasing attention because of their desirable properties, such as biodegradability and sustainability. In this regard, the current study initially reviews cellulose products’ properties in three categories, including biopolymers based on the cellulose-derived monomer, cellulose fibers and their derivatives, and nanocellulose. The available life cycle assessments (LCA) for cellulose were comprehensively reviewed and classified at all the stages, including extraction of cellulose in various forms, manufacturing, usage, and disposal. Finally, due to the development of low-carbon materials in recent years and the importance of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, the proposed solutions to make cellulose a low carbon material were made. The optimization of the cellulose production process, such as the recovery of excessive solvents and using by-products as inputs for other processes, seem to be the most important step toward making it a low carbon material.","Foroughi, Firoozeh; Rezvani Ghomi, Erfan; Morshedi Dehaghi, Fatemeh; Borayek, Ramadan; Ramakrishna, Seeram",Materials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7913577/,269

STUDY DESIGN: This case-control study was performed at St. Louis Children’s Hospital NICU from 2009 to 2019. The MRSA-colonized infants who developed symptomatic MRSA infection (cases) were matched 1:3 with MRSA-colonized infants who did not develop infection (controls). Demographics and characteristics of NICU course were compared between groups. Longitudinal information from subsequent hospitalizations was also obtained. RESULTS: Forty-two infected cases were compared with 126 colonized-only controls. Cases became colonized earlier in their NICU stay, were less likely to have received mupirocin for decolonization, and had a longer course of mechanical ventilation than controls. Longitudinally, cases had a more protracted NICU course and were more likely to require hospital readmission. CONCLUSION: Progression from MRSA colonization to symptomatic infection is associated with increased morbidity and may be mitigated through decolonization.","Schuetz, Carly R.; Hogan, Patrick G.; Reich, Patrick J.; Halili, Sara; Wiseman, Hannah E.; Boyle, Mary G.; Thompson, Ryley M.; Warner, Barbara B.; Fritz, Stephanie A.",J Perinatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7917959/,269
15868,"Effects of Phlorotannins on Organisms: Focus on the Safety, Toxicity, and Availability of Phlorotannins",2021-02-19,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Colorectal cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. However, high-risk populations with a genetic predisposition for colorectal cancer could benefit greatly from novel and efficacious immunopreventive strategies that afford long-lasting protection. The achaete-scute family bHLH transcription factor 2 (Ascl2) has been identified as a promising target for immunoprevention of colorectal cancer, based on its induction during the formation and progression of colorectal tumors and its minimal expression observed in healthy tissue. The goal of the present study was to determine the efficacy of a protein-based vaccine targeting Ascl2 in combination with an anti-PD-1 treatment in a spontaneous colorectal cancer mouse model. This novel vaccine strategy promotes potent tumor-specific immunity, and prevents the formation of colon adenomas in mice. The results demonstrate that Ascl2 is a promising target for immunoprevention for individuals at elevated risk of developing colorectal cancer. ABSTRACT: Novel immunopreventive strategies are emerging that show great promise for conferring long-term protection to individuals at high risk of developing colorectal cancer. The KISIMA vaccine platform utilizes a chimeric protein comprising: (1) a selected tumor antigen; (2) a cell-penetrating peptide to improve antigen delivery and epitope presentation, and (3) a TLR2/4 agonist to serve as a self-adjuvant. This study examines the ability of a KISIMA vaccine against achaete-scute family bHLH transcription factor 2 (Ascl2), an early colon cancer antigen, to reduce colon tumor formation by stimulating an anti-tumor immune response. Vaccine administrations were well-tolerated and led to circulating antibodies and antigen-specific T cells in a mouse model of colorectal cancer. To assess preventive efficacy, the vaccine was administered to mice either alone or in combination with the immune checkpoint inhibitor anti-PD-1. When delivered to animals prior to colon tumor formation, the combination strategy significantly reduced the development of colon microadenomas and adenomas, as compared to vehicle-treated controls. This response was accompanied by an increase in the intraepithelial density of CD3+ T lymphocytes. Together, these data indicate that the KISIMA-Ascl2 vaccine shows great potential to be a safe and potent immunopreventive intervention for individuals at high risk of developing colorectal cancer.","Belnoue, Elodie; Leystra, Alyssa A.; Carboni, Susanna; Cooper, Harry S.; Macedo, Rodrigo T.; Harvey, Kristen N.; Colby, Kimberly B.; Campbell, Kerry S.; Vanderveer, Lisa A.; Clapper, Margie L.; Derouazi, Madiha",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7923075/,269
17345,Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease by Time-Dependent Power Spectrum Descriptors and Convolutional Neural Network Using EEG Signal,2021-04-23,"Air pollution exposure remains a leading public health problem in China. The use of chemical transport models to quantify the impacts of various emission changes on air quality is limited by their large computational demands. Machine learning models can emulate chemical transport models to provide computationally efficient predictions of outputs based on statistical associations with inputs. We developed novel emulators relating emission changes in five key anthropogenic sectors (residential, industry, land transport, agriculture, and power generation) to winter ambient fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) concentrations across China. The emulators were optimized based on Gaussian process regressors with Matern kernels. The emulators predicted 99.9% of the variance in PM(2.5) concentrations for a given input configuration of emission changes. PM(2.5) concentrations are primarily sensitive to residential (51%–94% of first‐order sensitivity index), industrial (7%–31%), and agricultural emissions (0%–24%). Sensitivities of PM(2.5) concentrations to land transport and power generation emissions are all under 5%, except in South West China where land transport emissions contributed 13%. The largest reduction in winter PM(2.5) exposure for changes in the five emission sectors is by 68%–81%, down to 15.3–25.9 μg m(−3), remaining above the World Health Organization annual guideline of 10 μg m(−3). The greatest reductions in PM(2.5) exposure are driven by reducing residential and industrial emissions, emphasizing the importance of emission reductions in these key sectors. We show that the annual National Air Quality Target of 35 μg m(−3) is unlikely to be achieved during winter without strong emission reductions from the residential and industrial sectors.","Conibear, Luke; Reddington, Carly L.; Silver, Ben J.; Chen, Ying; Knote, Christoph; Arnold, Stephen R.; Spracklen, Dominick V.",Geohealth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8095364/,269
17502,Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Severity with fMRI Images Using Robust Multitask Feature Extraction Method and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),2021-04-27,"The human zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) recognizes RNA by binding to CpG dinucleotides. Mammalian transcriptomes are CpG-poor, and ZAP may have evolved to exploit this feature to specifically target non-self viral RNA. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that ZAP and its paralogue PARP12 share an ancestral gene that arose prior to extensive eukaryote divergence, and the ZAP lineage diverged from the PARP12 lineage in tetrapods. Notably, the CpG content of modern eukaryote genomes varies widely, and ZAP-like genes arose subsequent to the emergence of CpG-suppression in vertebrates. Human PARP12 exhibited no antiviral activity against wild type and CpG-enriched HIV-1, but ZAP proteins from several tetrapods had antiviral activity when expressed in human cells. In some cases, ZAP antiviral activity required a TRIM25 protein from the same or related species, suggesting functional co-evolution of these genes. Indeed, a hypervariable sequence in the N-terminal domain of ZAP contributed to species-specific TRIM25 dependence in antiviral activity assays. Crosslinking immunoprecipitation coupled with RNA sequencing revealed that ZAP proteins from human, mouse, bat and alligator exhibit a high degree of CpG-specificity, while some avian ZAP proteins appear more promiscuous. Together, these data suggest that the CpG- rich RNA directed antiviral activity of ZAP-related proteins arose in tetrapods, subsequent to the onset of CpG suppression in certain eukaryote lineages, with subsequent species-specific adaptation of cofactor requirements and RNA target specificity.","Gonçalves-Carneiro, Daniel; Takata, Matthew A.; Ong, Heley; Shilton, Amanda; Bieniasz, Paul D.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8102003/,269
18007,Accurate Tumor Segmentation via Octave Convolution Neural Network,2021-05-19,"BACKGROUND: Interferon lambda receptor 1 (IFNLR1) is a type II cytokine receptor that clings to interleukins IL-28A, IL29B, and IL-29 referred to as type III IFNs (IFN-λs). IFN-λs act through the JAK-STAT signaling pathway to exert antiviral effects related to preventing and curing an infection. Although the immune function of IFN-λs in virus invasion has been described, the molecular mechanism of IFNLR1 in that process is unclear. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to elucidate the role of IFNLR1 in the pathogenesis and treatment of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). METHODS: The effects of IFNLR1 on the proliferation of porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) during PRRSV infection were investigated using interference and overexpression methods. RESULTS: In this study, the expressions of the IFNLR1 gene in the liver, large intestine, small intestine, kidney, and lung tissues of Dapulian pigs were significantly higher than those in Landrace pigs. It was determined that porcine IFNLR1 overexpression suppresses PRRSV replication. The qRT-PCR results revealed that overexpression of IFNLR1 upregulated antiviral and IFN-stimulated genes. IFNLR1 overexpression inhibits the proliferation of PAMs and upregulation of p-STAT1. By contrast, knockdown of IFNLR1 expression promotes PAMs proliferation. The G0/G1 phase proportion in IFNLR1-overexpressing cells increased, and the opposite change was observed in IFNLR1-underexpressing cells. After inhibition of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, the G2/M phase proportion in the IFNLR1-overexpressing cells showed a significant increasing trend. In conclusion, overexpression of IFNLR1 induces activation of the JAK/STAT pathway, thereby inhibiting the proliferation of PAMs infected with PRRSV. CONCLUSION: Expression of the IFNLR1 gene has an important regulatory role in PRRSV-infected PAMs, indicating it has potential as a molecular target in developing a new strategy for the treatment of PRRSV.","Qin, Ming; Chen, Wei; Li, Zhixin; Wang, Lixue; Ma, Lixia; Geng, Jinhong; Zhang, Yu; Zhao, Jing; Zeng, Yongqing",J Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8170216/,269

Therefore, in this work we propose a two-step automatic detector for ladybird beetles in random environment images as the first stage towards an automated classification system. First, an image processing module composed of a saliency map representation, simple linear iterative clustering superpixels segmentation, and active contour methods allowed us to generate bounding boxes with possible ladybird beetles locations within an image. Subsequently, a deep convolutional neural network-based classifier selects only the bounding boxes with ladybird beetles as the final output. This method was validated on a 2, 300 ladybird beetle image data set from Ecuador and Colombia obtained from the iNaturalist project. The proposed approach achieved an accuracy score of 92% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.977 for the bounding box generation and classification tasks.

19123,Semantic Data Mining in Ubiquitous Sensing: A Survey,2021-06-24,"BACKGROUND: Postpartum depression (PPD) is a significant cause of maternal morbidity and has severe consequences on the well-being of mothers, new-borns, families, and communities. PPD reduces the mother’s response to the child’s needs. In severe cases, mothers suffering from PPD are prone to postpartum psychosis, commit suicide and, in rare cases, infanticide. We aimed to determine the prevalence and understand the factors associated with PPD among mothers in southwestern Uganda. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study between November 2019 and June 2020 among 292 mothers, 6 to 8 weeks’ postpartum. Mothers were selected from three health facilities in southwestern Uganda and enrolled using stratified consecutive sampling. Postpartum depression was clinically diagnosed using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders V. The factors associated with PPD were assessed by using a structured interviewer administered questionnaire. The factors were analyzed using bivariate chi square analyses and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Overall prevalence of PPD was 27.1% (95% CI: 22.2–32.5). This did not vary by the number of previous births or mode of birth. Five factors associated with PPD were low perceived social support, HIV positive status, rural residence, obstetrical complications and the baby crying excessively. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Prevalence of PPD in Mbarara and Rwampara districts is higher than what has previously been reported in Uganda indicating an urgent need to identify pregnant women who are at increased risk of PPD to mitigate their risk or implement therapies to manage the condition. Midwives who attend to these mothers need to be empowered with available methods of mitigating prevalence and consequences of PPD. Women who are HIV positive, residing in rural settings, whose babies cry excessively, having low social support systems and who have birth complications may be a particularly important focus for Ugandan intervention strategies to prevent and reduce the prevalence of PPD.

19126,Review: Application of Artificial Intelligence in Phenomics,2021-06-25,"Memory and long term potentiation require de novo protein synthesis. A key regulator of this process is mTORC1, a complex comprising the mTOR kinase. Growth factors activate mTORC1 via a pathway involving PI3-kinase, Akt, the TSC complex and the GTPase Rheb. In non-neuronal cells, translocation of mTORC1 to late endocytic compartments (LEs), where Rheb is enriched, is triggered by amino acids. However, the regulation of mTORC1 in neurons remains unclear. In mouse hippocampal neurons, we observed that BDNF and treatments activating NMDA receptors trigger a robust increase in mTORC1 activity. NMDA receptors activation induced a significant recruitment of mTOR onto lysosomes even in the absence of external amino acids, whereas mTORC1 was evenly distributed in neurons under resting conditions. NMDA receptor-induced mTOR translocation to LEs was partly dependent on the BDNF receptor TrkB, suggesting that BDNF contributes to the effect of NMDA receptors on mTORC1 translocation. In addition, the combination of Rheb overexpression and artificial mTORC1 targeting to LEs by means of a modified component of mTORC1 fused with a LE-targeting motif strongly activated mTOR. To gain spatial and temporal control over mTOR localization, we designed an optogenetic module based on light-sensitive dimerizers able to recruit mTOR on LEs. In cells expressing this optogenetic tool, mTOR was translocated to LEs upon photoactivation. In the absence of growth factor, this was not sufficient to activate mTORC1. In contrast, mTORC1 was potently activated by a combination of BDNF and photoactivation. The data demonstrate that two important triggers of synaptic plasticity, BDNF and NMDA receptors, synergistically power the two arms of the mTORC1 activation mechanism, i.e., mTORC1 translocation to LEs and Rheb activation. Moreover, they unmask a functional link between NMDA receptors and mTORC1 that could underlie the changes in the synaptic proteome associated with long-lasting changes in synaptic strength.

20369,TransMed: Transformers Advance Multi-Modal Medical Image Classification,2021-07-31,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Health-related quality of life in the adolescent stage is of vital importance because it provides the adolescent with an impression of his or her functional capacity, allowing him or her to examine, discover, and distinguish sensations and concerns. This indicator provides information on the person’s state of health. The EQ-5D-Y questionnaire was used to measure health-related quality of life, due to its simplicity and ease of use. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to describe the perceived quality of life in Peruvian school adolescents. Despite the increase in health-related quality of life studies, there is little research on the Latin American population. For this reason, it would be important to have normative data in Peru in order to estimate the impact on health-related quality of life in adolescents, since it allows comparisons of health-related quality of life between the general population and the pathological population. The results have shown that there are differences in the EQ-5D-Y between ages, as well as between weight groups established according to body mass index. In conclusion, adolescents have perceived favorable health-related quality of life sensations and the EQ-5D-Y has shown to be a feasible and useful questionnaire, in addition to having internationally recognized and validated cross-cultural characteristics. ABSTRACT: (1) Introduction: There is a growing interest in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in adolescent population. The EQ-5D-Y is a generic HRQOL instrument that allows adolescents to understand the health status of different levels of physical, mental, and social health. This study was carried out with an adolescent population in Peru. The main objective of this article is to report the normative values of the EQ-5D-Y questionnaire in Peruvian adolescents. (2) Methods: The EQ-5D-Y questionnaire was administered to Peruvian adolescent students. A total of 1229 young people participated in the survey. The EQ-5D-Y score was reflected as a function of sex and age. (3) Results: The mean utility index of the EQ-5D-Y for the total sample was 0.890; this rating was significantly better for males at (0.899) and females at (0.881). The ceiling effect was higher for adolescent males with (47.3) females (40.7). (4) Conclusions: The results of the present study provide evidence that schooled adolescents show a positive perception of HRQOL.","Palacios-Cartagena, Roxana Paola; Adsuar, Jose Carmelo; Hernández-Mocholí, Miguel Ángel; Carlos-Vivas, Jorge; Barrios-Fernández, Sabina; Garcia-Gordillo, Miguel Angel; Mendoza-Muñoz, María",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8392215/,269

NETs are part of the host’s innate immune defense system against invading pathogens. Interestingly, these extracellular structures can also be released in response to sterile inflammatory stimuli (e.g., shear stress, lipidic molecules, pro-thrombotic factors, aggregated platelets, or pro-inflammatory cytokines), as in atherosclerosis disease. Indeed, NETs have been identified in the intimal surface of diseased arteries under cardiovascular disease conditions, where they sustain inflammation via NET-mediated cell-adhesion mechanisms and promote cellular dysfunction and tissue damage via NET-associated cytotoxicity. This review will focus on (1) the active role of neutrophils and NETs as underestimated players of the inflammatory process during atherogenesis and lesion progression; (2) how these extracellular structures communicate with the main cell types present in the atherosclerotic lesion in the arterial wall; and (3) how these neutrophil effector functions interplay with lifestyle-derived risk factors such as an unbalanced diet, physical inactivity, smoking or lack of sleep quality, which represent major elements in the development of cardiovascular disease.","Pérez-Olivares, Laura; Soehnlein, Oliver",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8394440/,269

We present phase 3 efficacy data from an African trial of a Vi-polysaccharide typhoid conjugate vaccine (Vi-TCV). METHODS: Children aged 9 months to 12 years in Blantyre, Malawi were randomized (1:1) in a double-blind trial to receive Vi-TCV (single dose) or group-A meningococcal control vaccine (MenA).The primary outcome was blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever. We present the primary vaccine efficacy (VE) and safety outcomes after 18–24 months of follow-up. RESULTS: This intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis included 28,130 children, comprising 14,069 children who received Vi-TCV and 14,061 children who received MenA. Blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever occurred in 12 children in the Vi-TCV group (46.9 per 100,000 person-years) and 62 children in the MenA group (243 per 100,000 person-years). Overall VE was 80.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 64.2% to 89.6%) in an ITT analysis, and 83.7% (95% CI: 68.1%−91.6%) in a per-protocol analysis. In total, 130 serious adverse events occurred in the first 6 months after vaccination (52 in Vi-TCV group and 78 in MenA group), including 6 deaths (all in MenA group). No serious adverse event was considered by the investigator as related to study vaccination.

METHODS: Here, to elucidate LINC01140 function, 79 paired LC and paracancerous tissues were collected. LINC01140 expression levels were determined using fluorescence in situ hybridization and qPCR analysis. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and transwell assays were performed. The interaction between microRNAs (miRNAs) and LINC01140 was confirmed using an RNA immunoprecipitation assay. Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cell phenotypes were analyzed by flow cytometry. Cytokine secretion levels were determined by ELISA. CIK cytotoxicity was assessed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release. Besides, xenograft tumor mouse models were used to unveil the in vivo function of LINC01140. RESULTS: We found that LINC01140 was highly expressed in human LC tissues and cell lines. High LINC01140 levels were associated with poor survival in patients with LC. LINC01140 upregulation promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of LC cells through direct interaction with miR-33a-5p and miR-33b-5p, thereby contributing to c-Myc expression and also inhibited cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis. In subcutaneous tumor xenograft mice, LINC01140 knockdown markedly reduced tumor growth and lung metastasis. Additionally, LINC01140 directly repressed miR-377-3 p and miR-155-5 p expression levels, resulting in the upregulation of their common downstream target programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), a crucial target in LC immunotherapy. Notably, we proved that LINC01140 knockdown, along with CIK administration, suppressed the growth of subcutaneous LC xenografts by decreasing PD-L1 expression in severe combined immunodeficient mice. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, LINC01140 overexpression protects c-Myc and PD-L1 mRNA from miRNA-mediated inhibition and contributes to the proliferation, migration, invasion, and immune escape of LC cells.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a technology-enabled, dynamically adaptive protocol that can provide the accurate information needed to inform specific remedies for immune toxic effects in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An open-label cohort study was conducted at a single tertiary referral center from September 6, 2019, to September 3, 2020. The median follow-up duration was 63 (interquartile range, 35.5-122) days. Fifty patients with genitourinary cancers treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors were enrolled. INTERVENTIONS: A fit-for-purpose electronic platform was developed to enable active patient and care team participation. A smartphone application downloaded onto patients’ personal mobile devices prompted them to report their symptoms at least 3 times per week. The set of symptoms and associated queries were paired with alert thresholds for symptoms requiring clinical action. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point of this interim analysis was feasibility, as measured by patient and care team adherence, and lack of increase in care team staffing. Operating characteristics were estimated for each symptom alert and used to dynamically adapt the alert thresholds to ensure sensitivity while reducing unnecessary alerts. RESULTS: Of the 50 patients enrolled, 47 had at least 1 follow-up visit and were included in the analysis. Median age was 65 years (range, 37-86), 39 patients (83%) were men, and 39 patients (83%) had metastatic cancer, with the most common being urothelial cell carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma (22 [47%] patients each).

However, disagreements arise over primary practices within PE to achieve this end. The primary divergence is whether PE facilitators should primarily ensure participants exert a specific level of energy during class or develop their confidence, competence, knowledge, and motivation for meaningful physical activity (PA) participation outside of the PE classroom (referred to as physical literacy (PL)). This study uses structural equation modeling to examine associations between enjoyment of PA and minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in PE class in grade 5 (mean age = 10) and participation in PA and feelings about PA 1 year later, in grade 6 (mean age = 11), in the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD, N = 1364). Enjoyment of PA in grade 5 predicted sport self-concept (β = 0.347, p ≤ 0.001), MVPA (β = 0.12, p ≤ 0.001), and enjoyment of PA (β = 0.538, p ≤ 0.001) in grade 6. These associations remained when including weekday MVPA performed in grade 5 as an indirect effect (β = 0.058, p ≤ 0.001).

Various factors influence caregivers’ decisions to seek mental health services (MHS) that could improve developmental outcomes. The present study applied a machine learning algorithm, elastic net, to a sample of 878 adolescent-caregiver dyads from the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect. Analyses simultaneously examined a large number of factors to determine their ability to discriminate between caregivers who perceived a need for MHS and those who did not, as well as caregivers who utilized MHS and those who did not. Results highlight family demographics, chronic parental stressors, youth psychopathology, and exposure to recent adversities as good classifiers of caregiver perceived need for (77.6%; sensitivity = .77; specificity = .78) and utilization of (71%; sensitivity = .71; specificity = .71) adolescent MHS. Elastic net identified adolescent clinical externalizing and internalizing problems, and parental stress related to child(ren)’s behavior as high value classifiers of both outcomes. Youth living with non-kin caregivers were also significantly more likely to utilize MHS. Findings highlight the importance of assessing clinical need, stress related to child(ren)’s behavior, and caregiver kinship in understanding the likelihood that at-risk families will seek adolescent MHS.","Vázquez, Alejandro L.; Chou, Tommy; Navarro Flores, Cynthia M.; Barrett, Tyson S.; Villodas, Miguel T.; Domenech Rodríguez, Melanie M.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8486129/,269

The clinical presentation of infections with these viruses may be indistinguishable from that associated with infection with classic hepatotropic viruses. The presentation ranges from mild and transient elevation of aminotransferases to acute hepatitis and can also lead to acute liver failure [1]. These viruses should be considered as possible etiologic agents in patients who have acute liver injury and whose serologic markers for the classic hepatotropic viruses are not indicative of an active infection [1].

25896,Prediction of Ribosomal -1 Frameshifts in the Escherichia coli K12 Genome,2006,"There are three classes of antiviral drugs approved for the treatment of influenza: the M2 ion channel inhibitors (amantadine, rimantadine), neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (laninamivir, oseltamivir, peramivir, zanamivir), and the protease inhibitor (favipiravir); some of the agents are only available in selected countries [1, 2]. These agents are effective at treating the signs and symptoms of influenza in patients infected with susceptible viruses. Clinical failure has been demonstrated in patients infected with viruses with primary resistance, i.e., antivirals can be present in the virus initially infecting the patient, or resistance may emerge during the course of therapy [3–5]. NA inhibitors are active against all nine NA subtypes recognized in nature [6], including highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5N1 and recent low-pathogenic avian influenza A/H7N9 viruses [7]. Since seasonal influenza is usually an acute, self-limited illness in which viral clearance usually occurs rapidly due to innate and adaptive host immune responses, the emergence of drug-resistant variants would be anticipated to have limited effect on clinical recovery in otherwise healthy patients, as has been demonstrated clinically [3, 8, 9]. Unfortunately, immunocompromised or immunologically naïve hosts, such as young children and infants or those exposed to novel strains, are more likely to have mutations that confer resistance emergence during therapy; such resistant variants may also result in clinically significant adverse outcomes [10–13].","van der Vries, Erhard; Ison, Michael G.",Antimicrobial Drug Resistance,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122614/,269

Vaccines for seasonal influenza have been available for decades and there is a wealth of data available on the immune response to these vaccines in humans, with well-established correlates of protection for inactivated influenza virus vaccines. Many of the seminal studies on vaccines for epidemic influenza have been conducted in human subjects. Studies in humans are performed less frequently now than they were in the past. Therefore, as the quest for improved influenza vaccines continues, it is important to consider the use of animal models for the evaluation of influenza vaccines, and a major challenge is the selection of an appropriate animal model that accurately reflects the disease and the protective immune response to influenza infection in humans. The emergence of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (AI) viruses and the threat of a pandemic caused by AI viruses of this or another subtype has resulted in a resurgence of interest in influenza vaccine research. The development of vaccines for pandemic influenza presents a unique set of obstacles, not the least of which is that the demonstration of efficacy in humans is not possible. As the correlates of protection from pandemic influenza are not known, we rely on extrapolation of the lessons from seasonal influenza vaccines and on data from the evaluation of pandemic influenza vaccines in animal models to guide our decisions on vaccines for use in humans. The features and contributions of commonly used animal models for influenza vaccine research are discussed. The recent emergence of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus underscores the unpredictable nature of influenza viruses and the importance of pandemic preparedness.","Luke, Catherine J.; Subbarao, Kanta",Influenza Vaccines for the Future,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123018/,269

Traditionally conceptualized as a type of political risk experienced by multinational enterprises (MNEs) operating in conflictive areas, terrorism has evolved in recent years. The global terrorist networks that dominate the international scene today have different motivations, strategies, tactics, and organizational structures than their secular and ethnic‐separatist predecessors and these differences matter for IB theory and practice. Moreover, these groups have shown themselves adaptive, resilient, and capable of striking targets of strategic and symbolic importance in global business and financial centers. This paper examines the changing nature of the terrorist threat to MNEs and the implications for a sector that has been a target of recent attacks: the luxury hotel industry. Structured as a case study of Marriott International, a leading global hospitality provider, the paper analyzes ways the firm is adapting to the evolving threat and the measures it has introduced to safeguard guests, staff, property, and brand.

However, the largest increases occurred in children of low socioeconomic status living in urban settings. Recent asthma statistics should be interpreted with consideration of changes made in the method for reporting asthma prevalence (Fig. 23-1). From 1980 to 1996, the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) conducted by the CDC measured pediatric asthma prevalence as the percentage of children with asthma in the past 12 months. Since 1997, asthma prevalence estimates have been defined as: having received an asthma diagnosis, currently having the disease at the time of the interview, and experiencing an attack in the past year.

The effects of microbes on their environment can be beneficial or harmful or inapparent with regard to human measure or observation. The most significant effect of the microbes on earth is their ability to recycle the primary elements that make up all living systems, especially carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen (N). Primary production involves photosynthetic organisms which take up CO(2) from the atmosphere and convert it to organic (cellular) material. The process is also called CO(2) fixation, and it accounts for a very large portion of organic carbon available for synthesis of cell material. Decomposition or biodegradation results in the breakdown of complex organic materials to other forms of carbon that can be used by other organisms. There is no naturally occurring organic compound that cannot be degraded by some microbe, although some synthetic compounds such as Teflon, plastics, insecticides, and pesticides are broken down very slowly or not at all. Through the microbial metabolic processes of fermentation and respiration, organic molecules are eventually broken down to CO(2) which is returned to the atmosphere for continuous process of primary production. Biological nitrogen fixation is a process found only in some bacteria which remove N(2) from the atmosphere and converts it to ammonia (NH(3)), for use by the plants and animals. Nitrogen fixation also results in replenishment of soil nitrogen removed by agricultural processes. Thus along with all these benefits, microbes greatly contribute in maintaining sustainability of environment. This chapter mainly focuses on beneficial and harmful impacts of microbes on environment and their role to maintain quality, health, and sustainability of environment.","Gupta, Ankit; Gupta, Rasna; Singh, Ram Lakhan",Principles and Applications of Environmental Biotechnology for a Sustainable Future,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7189961/,269

The number of allowed passes over the input, which is typically a function of input length, is considered as a resource besides the advice amount. The results proved for the model include a hierarchy for cdfat with real-time heads, simulation of 1w/1w cdfat by 1w/rt cdfat, lower bounds of resources provided to a cdfat in order to make it powerful enough to recognize any language, utilizable advice limit regardless of the allowed pass limit, a relation between utilizable pass limit and advice limit, and some closure properties.","Uçan, Ahmet Bilal",Language and Automata Theory and Applications,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206619/,269

Since an AAD has been conceived as a mathematical representation of the connotative meaning in an experience-based evaluation, the incorporation of AADs into a NB classification process helps to put the resulting predictions in context.

However, there is an almost total lack of reference documents allowing a proper assessment of the performance of soft classifiers in such soft topic identification tasks. To address this lack, in this paper a method is proposed that generates topic identification reference documents with a soft but objective nature, and which proceeds by combining, in random but known proportions, phrases of existing documents dealing with different topics. We also provide a computational study illustrating the application of the proposed method on a well-known benchmark for topic identification, as well as showing the possibility of carrying out an informative evaluation of soft classifiers in the context of soft topic identification.","Vélez, Daniel; Villarino, Guillermo; Rodríguez, J.

34174,"Towards Energy-, Time- and Security-Aware Multi-core Coordination",2020-05-13,"Fault-tolerance is a core feature in distributed database systems, particularly the ones deployed in cloud environments. The dependability of these systems often relies in middleware components that abstract the DBMS logic from the replication itself. The highly configurable nature of these systems makes their throughput very dependent on the correct tuning for a given workload. Given the high complexity involved, machine learning techniques are often considered to guide the tuning process and decompose the relations established between tuning variables. This paper presents a machine learning mechanism based on reinforcement learning that attaches to a hybrid replication middleware connected to a DBMS to dynamically live-tune the configuration of the middleware according to the workload being processed. Along with the vision for the system, we present a study conducted over a prototype of the self-tuned replication middleware, showcasing the achieved performance improvements and showing that we were able to achieve an improvement of 370.99% on some of the considered metrics.","Ferreira, Luís; Coelho, Fábio; Pereira, José",Distributed Applications and Interoperable Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7276253/,269
34179,Towards a Formally Verified EVM in Production Environment,2020-05-13,"Users of interactive services such as e-commerce platforms have high expectations for the performance and responsiveness of these services. Tail latency, denoting the worst service times, contributes greatly to user dissatisfaction and should be minimized. Maintaining low tail latency for interactive services is challenging because a request is not complete until all its operations are completed. The challenge is to identify bottleneck operations and schedule them on uncoordinated backend servers with minimal overhead, when the duration of these operations are heterogeneous and unpredictable. In this paper, we focus on improving the latency of multiget operations in cloud data stores. We present TailX, a task-aware multiget scheduling algorithm that improves tail latencies under heterogeneous workloads. TailX schedules operations according to an estimation of the size of the corresponding data, and allows itself to procrastinate some operations to give way to higher priority ones. We implement TailX in Cassandra, a widely used key-value store. The result is an improved overall performance of the cloud data stores for a wide variety of heterogeneous workloads. Specifically, our experiments under heterogeneous YCSB workloads show that TailX outperforms state-of-the-art solutions and reduces tail latencies by up to 70% and median latencies by up to 75%.","Jaiman, Vikas; Ben Mokhtar, Sonia; Rivière, Etienne",Distributed Applications and Interoperable Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7276259/,269
34184,Refined Mean Field Analysis: The Gossip Shuffle Protocol Revisited,2020-05-13,"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome characterized by colorectal adenomas and a near 100% lifetime risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Prophylactic colectomy, usually by age 40, is the gold-standard therapy to mitigate this risk. However, colectomy is associated with morbidity and fails to prevent extra-colonic disease manifestations, including gastric polyposis, duodenal polyposis and cancer, thyroid cancer, and desmoid disease. Substantial research has investigated chemoprevention medications in an aim to prevent disease progression, postponing the need for colectomy and temporizing the development of extracolonic disease. An ideal chemoprevention agent should have a biologically plausible mechanism of action, be safe and easily tolerated over a prolonged treatment period, and produce a durable and clinically meaningful effect. To date, no chemoprevention agent tested has fulfilled these criteria. New agents targeting novel pathways in FAP are needed. Substantial preclinical literature exists linking the molecular target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway to FAP. A single case report of rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, used as chemoprevention in FAP patients exists, but no formal clinical studies have been conducted. Here, we review the prior literature on chemoprevention in FAP, discuss the rationale for rapamycin in FAP, and outline a proposed clinical trial testing rapamycin as a chemoprevention agent in patients with FAP.","Kemp Bohan, Phillip M.; Mankaney, Gautam; Vreeland, Timothy J.; Chick, Robert C.; Hale, Diane F.; Cindass, Jessica L.; Hickerson, Annelies T.; Ensley, Daniel C.; Sohn, Vance; Clifton, G.

34549,Comparison of Recurrent Neural Networks for Wind Power Forecasting,2020-04-29,"OBJECTIVES: To describe oral complementary medicine (CM) use in people with inflammatory arthritis, associations with use, and changes in use over time. METHODS: Demographic, clinical, and patient-reported outcome data from 5,630 participants with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) were extracted from the Australian Rheumatology Association Database (ARAD), a national observational database. CM use at entry into ARAD was ascertained for participants recruited between 2002 and 2018. CM was categorised according to the NIH/Cochrane schema (fatty acids, herbs, or supplements). Logistic regression was used to assess associations between demographic characteristics and CM use. Change in CM use between 2006 and 2016 was investigated using a nonparametric test for trend of rate by year. RESULTS: 2,156 (38.3%) ARAD participants were taking CM at enrolment (RA: 1,502/3,960 (37.9%), AS: 281/736 (38.2%), PsA: 334/749 (44.6%), and JIA: 39/185 (21.1%)). CM use was more prevalent in women (OR 1.3; 95% CI: 1.13-1.50), those with tertiary education (OR 1.32; 95% CI: 1.13-1.55), private health insurance (OR 1.26; (95% CI: 1.10-1.44), drinking alcohol sometimes (OR 1.22; 95% CI: 1.05-1.43), poorer function (HAQ) (OR 1.13; 95% CI: 1.02-1.24), use of NSAID (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.17-1.50), weak (OR 1.21; 95% CI 1.05-1.41) but not strong opioids, and less prevalent in current smokers (OR 0.76; 95%: CI 0.63-0.91). CM use was not associated with pain, disease activity, or quality of life. The most common CMs were fish oils (N = 1,489 users) followed by glucosamine (N = 605). Both declined in use over time between 2006 and 2016 (27.5% to 21.4%, trend p = 0.85 and 15.5% to 6.4%, trend p < 0.01), respectively. CONCLUSION: Oral CM use is common among Australians with inflammatory arthritis. Its use is greater among women and those with tertiary education.

35569,"SPX Flow Inc, USA",2020-06-29,"OBJECTIVES: Calcium channel blockers are highly protein-bound medications frequently used in the management of hypertension. Overdose results in severe hypotension and is the fourth most common cause of toxicity-related deaths in the United States. Management is mostly supportive, with currently no standard role for targeted drug removal. The protein-bound nature of these medications presents the option of utilizing albumin dialysis for their removal and for the reversal of associated shock. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: We present two cases of life-threatening intentional amlodipine overdoses successfully treated with albumin dialysis. Both patients experienced profound distributive shock in the setting of preserved cardiac contractility that was refractory to maximal vasoactive agent support. INTERVENTIONS AND RESULTS: After initiation of albumin dialysis, the patients showed rapid hemodynamic improvement and were able to be weaned off vasopressor support. CONCLUSIONS: These cases demonstrate the safety and efficacy of albumin dialysis in the management of near-fatal calcium channel blocker overdoses related to amlodipine and offer an additional therapeutic option apart from conventional supportive care. Importantly, these cases were not associated with impaired cardiac contractility, thereby making venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation a less preferable option. Furthermore, this therapeutic benefit of albumin dialysis can potentially be extended to the management of toxicity related to other highly protein-bound drugs and toxins.","Connor-Schuler, Randi L.; Carr, Jennifer M.; Reaven, Matthew S.; Bridgman, Bob T.; Patel, Deepa M.; Subramanian, Ram M.",Crit Care Explor,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314353/,269

The current generation is between stories—the religious and the scientific. How might religious education be developed in the Catholic school to reflect the growing convergence in theological discourse of the Christian Story with the New Universe Story? How might it energise young students with images that empower them to develop a prophetic stance towards their future and the future of humanity? We first consider the need for a paradigm shift in the way we tell the Christian Story. Then, taking our lead from the theology of Karl Rahner which allows us to take a cosmic view of Christian religious experience, and from various writers who apply such a view to different areas of Christian life, we attempt a synthesis of current theological thought. Lastly, we suggest how this shift might be applied to the religious education curriculum in order to provide an answer to the questions posed above.","Faller, Paul",j,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7322220/,269

The branch number of it ensures that any continuous four rounds of the AES have at least 25 active S-Boxes, which makes the AES secure against the differential and linear cryptanalysis. However, the choices of the coefficients of the MixColumns matrix may undermine the AES security against some novel-type attacks. A particular property of the AES MixColumns matrix coefficient has been noticed in recent papers that each row or column of the matrix has elements that sum to zero. Several attacks have been developed taking advantage of the coefficient property. In this paper we investigate further the influence of the specific coefficient property on the AES security. Our target, which is also one of the targets of the previous works, is a 5-round AES variant with a secret S-Box. We will show how we take advantage of the coefficient property to extract the secret key directly without any assistance of the S-Box information.

It then presents, based on this framework and based on the challenges reported by several Chinese education specialists during two national online seminars, a set of guidelines for the effective use of OER and OEP for both teaching and learning. Finally, this study presents some recommendations for the better adoption of OER and OEP in the future.

We include five stock market indexes for different countries such as Standard and Poor’s 500 composite Index (S&P), Nasdaq, Nikkei, Stoxx, and DowJones. Using daily data over the period 2010–2019. We examine two asymmetric stochastic volatility models used to describe the volatility dependencies found in most financial returns. Two models are compared, the first is the autoregressive stochastic volatility model with Student’s t-distribution (ARSV-t), and the second is the basic SVOL. To estimate these models, our analysis is based on the Markov Chain Monte-Carlo method. Therefore, the technique used is a Metropolis–Hastings (Hastings in Biometrika 57:97–109, 1970), and the Gibbs sampler (Casella and George in Am Stat 46:167–174, 1992; Gelfand and Smith in J Am Stat Assoc 85:398–409, 1990; Gilks and Wild in 41:337–348, 1992). Model comparisons illustrate that the ARSV-t model performs better performances. We conclude that this model is better than the SVOL model on the MSE and AIC function. This result concerns bitcoin as well as the other stock market indices. Without forgetting that our finding proves the efficiency of Markov Chain for our sample and the convergence and stability for all parameters to a certain level. On the whole, it seems that permanent shocks have an effect on the volatility of the price of the bitcoin and also on the other stock market.

Uncertainty persists as to whether hyperoxia is benign in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), particularly in regard to their long-term functional neurological outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective multicenter cohort study of invasively ventilated patients with TBI admitted to the ICU. A database linkage between the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Adult Patient Database (ANZICS-APD) and the Victorian State Trauma Registry (VSTR) was utilized. The primary exposure variable was minimum acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) III P(a)O(2) in the first 24 h of ICU. We defined hypoxia as P(a)O(2) < 60 mmHg, normoxia as 60–299 mmHg, and hyperoxia as ≥ 300 mmHg. The primary outcome was a Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) < 5 at 6 months while secondary outcomes included 12 and 24 months GOSE and mortality at each of these timepoints. Additional sensitivity analyses were undertaken in the following subgroups: isolated head injury, patients with operative intervention, head injury severity, and P(a)O(2) either subcategorized by increments of 60 mmHg or treated as a continuous variable. RESULTS: A total of 3699 patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 42.8 years, 77.7% were male and the mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) III score was 60.1 (26.3). 2842 patients experienced normoxia, and 783 hyperoxia. The primary outcome occurred in 1470 (47.1%) of patients overall with 1123 (47.1%) from the normoxia group and 312 (45.9%) from the hyperoxia group—odds ratio 0.99 (0.78–1.25). No significant differences in outcomes between groups at 6, 12, and 24 months were observed. Sensitivity analyses did not identify subgroups that were adversely affected by exposure to hyperoxia. CONCLUSIONS: No associations were observed between hyperoxia in ICU during the first 24 h and adverse neurological outcome at 6 months in ventilated TBI patients.

We assessed the ability of a continuous noninvasive temperature monitor to accurately approximate core temperature during TTM. METHODS: All patients undergoing TTM using a gel pad surface TMD and an existing core temperature monitoring device were eligible for this study. Core and continuous noninvasive temperature monitoring values were simultaneously recorded for up to 72 h of TTM. The two sets of temperature data were downloaded from a clinical data acquisition storage system at 1-min intervals. The Bland–Altman method assessed agreement between the core and continuous noninvasive temperature monitor values, by measuring the mean difference (± 2 SD) between these values. RESULTS: There were 20 subjects that underwent study between January 2018 and March 2018 (55% women, age: 57 ± 14 years old, BMI: 28.9 + 9.8 kg/m(2), 100% mechanically ventilated). The comparison patient temperature source was predominantly esophageal (n = 10) followed by bladder (n = 5) or rectal (n = 5). There were a total of 999 h of paired patient temperature data from esophageal (50%), bladder (25%), and rectal (25%) temperatures. Bland–Altman analysis demonstrated good agreement with the superficial temperature monitor and core temperature measures in all patients overall, with a difference mean of 0.06 ± 0.39 C (P = 0.99) and no proportional bias noted (β =0.002, P = 0.917). CONCLUSIONS: Continuous noninvasive temperature monitoring is a suitable alternative method for assessing core temperature during TTM. Future studies should focus on developing connectivity with a continuous noninvasive temperature monitor to approximate core temperature during TTM.","Wagner, Melissa; Lim-Hing, Krista; Bautista, Mary Ann; Blaber, Brigid; Ryder, Taghi; Haymore, Joseph; Badjatia, Neeraj",Neurocrit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7338135/,269

While a normative convergence between Russia and China appears to be underway, there remains a legacy of historical mistrust in addition to potential irritants that could plague their bilateral relationship. Nonetheless, if Western sanctions against Russia and pressure on China continue unabated, they may have little option but to continue their rapprochement. Against this backdrop, this article will explore whether the two countries currently display a ‘thin’ or ‘thick’ bilateral relationship, making use of an English School theoretical framework. It will do so by exploring established English School concepts such as pluralism and solidarism and discussing notable literature within the School on contestation in order to derive conclusions regarding the potential future shape of international order in Eurasia.","Paikin, Zachary",Int Polit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7358994/,269

Surgical outcome and overall impact on patients and healthcare service were also assessed. Methods This was a prospective cohort study of all women with adnexal masses presenting to the gynaecological oncology MDM at a central London tertiary cancer centre between February 2017 and February 2018. The multidisciplinary team (MDT) outcome, imaging details, subjective opinion, tumour markers, surgical details, and final histological diagnosis were collected. Diagnostic performance was also determined. Results There were 200 eligible patients in the study period. MDM imaging review demonstrated a sensitivity of 98.4% (95% CI: 94.3% to 99.8%) and a specificity of 52% (95% CI: 40.2% to 63.7%). Thirty-five cases were false positive, either presumed invasive cancers (51%) or borderline tumours (49%). The most common histological types were serous (37%) and mucinous (31%) cystadenomas. A retrospective application of the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) Assessment of Different NEoplasias in the adneXa (ADNEX) model suggests a potential reduction in false-positive rates (17%). Among the false-positive cases, there was no postoperative (90 days) mortality and postoperative morbidity was 14% with only grade 2 (CD2) complications according to Clavien and Dindo's CD classification. Conclusion An MDT has high sensitivity but low specificity when characterising ovarian masses referred with possible ovarian cancer to the tertiary centre. False-positive values in ovarian cancers are an important indicator of over-treatment. More research is required to assess other methods, such as the IOTA ADNEX model, to reduce the false-positive value.","Quaranta, Michela; Nath, Rahul; Mehra, Gautam; Diab, Yasser; Sayasneh, Ahmad",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7429623/,269

The proposed technique uses end-to-end deep learning to learn structured and composable representations from input images and discrete labels. The obtained representations are based on distance estimates between the distributions given by the class label and those given by contextual information, which are modeled as environments. We prove that the representations have a clear structure allowing to decompose the representation into factors that represent classes and environments.

The first part of the book examines the emergence of the current rules-based international order in the aftermath of the Second World War, uncovers its inherent flaws, and draws out how it has now become a source of conflict rather than stability. Part two is devoted to debunking myths about trade and trade agreements—particularly the idea that these are central to economic dynamism. Arguing that the relationship between trade and economic growth has been turned upside down, Mullan aims to put it back on its feet. The concluding part sets out some positive proposals for how to reimagine economic policy approaches in ways that could enable root-and-branch renewal and to think afresh about what type of political culture would facilitate such necessary changes.","Hammond, Philip",Fudan J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7462104/,269

In particular, cardiac electrophysiology is characterized by continuous innovation and has progressed rapidly over the last few years. This may have led to a gap between clinical training and the new technologies and could significantly change training requirements. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the survey was to obtain the opinion of young cardiologists about the current importance and satisfaction of cardiac electrophysiology training and to identify areas for improvement. METHODS: The survey was conducted in May 2020. Young DGK (Deutschen Gesellschaft für Kardiologie, German Society for Cardiology) members were contacted via e‑mail and asked to answer an online-based questionnaire. The questionnaire containing information about the current status, satisfaction, and structures of educational and clinical proficiency of cardiac electrophysiology in Germany. RESULTS: Overall, 131 young DGK members completed the survey. Mean age was 33 ± 3.3 years and 68% of the participants were male. Among the participants, 64% were cardiology fellows, while 36% were qualified. A total of 72 participants (53%) reported overall satisfaction with their clinical training and 50% of the participants held the opinion that cardiac electrophysiology should become a larger part of their education. Training courses and fellowships were rated mostly positive (70% vs. 93%, respectively); however, the later were unknown to 41% of the participants. Areas identified for improvement included the following: establishment of general cardiac electrophysiology rotation; enabling access to procedures to gain invasive skills; increased advertising for training courses and fellowships; increase of online-based training courses. CONCLUSION: The survey underlines the interest of young cardiologists in an intensified cardiac electrophysiology training within their cardiology training.","Willy, Kevin; Müller, Patrick; Eckardt, Lars; Duncker, David",Herzschrittmacherther Elektrophysiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7462106/,269

41177,People and the HMI of the Future,2020-10-23,"BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is one of the most important global health problems. More than one and half million of children are living with HIV in the world, and majority of them are found in sub-Saharan Africa. There are primary fragmented study findings, and no review was conducted with regard to vertical HIV infection in East Africa. Therefore, this review aimed to assess the prevalence of vertical HIV infection and its risk factors among HIV-exposed infants in East Africa. MAIN BODY: Eligible studies were retrieved by relevant search terms in CINHAL, Pub-MED, Google Scholar, EMBASE, Web of Science, SCOPUS, Cochrane, African Journals Online databases, and Ethiopian University research repositories. Data were extracted with Microsoft Excel and analyzed with Stata version 11 software. The random effect model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of vertical HIV infection in East Africa. The variation between studies was quantified with an I(2) statistic test. Furthermore, sub-group and meta-regression analyses were done to identify the sources of heterogeneity between the studies. The publication bias was assessed by Egger test. This systematic review and meta-analysis have included a total of 33 research articles. The overall pooled prevalence of vertical HIV infection in East Africa was 7.68% with a 95% confidence interval [CI]: (6.23, 9.12) with a heterogeneity of I(2) = 86.8 with a p value < 0.001. In subgroup analysis, the pooled prevalence of vertical HIV infection in cross-sectional studies was 6.58%, while in cohort studies were 9.37%. Mixed feeding, AOR = 6.22 (1.02, 11.41); home delivery, AOR = 2 (1.01, 3); mothers took ART less than 4 weeks, AOR = 1.92 (1.79, 2.06); and infants who have not received ARV prophylaxis, AOR = 2.02 (1.05, 2.98) were the associated factors for vertical HIV infection for exposed infants. CONCLUSIONS: The pooled prevalence of the mother to child transmission of HIV is way more than the desired target of the World Health Organization, which is less than 5% in breastfeeding populations. Thus, strengthening the prevention of vertical HIV transmission, promotion of exclusive breastfeeding, timely initiation of ART prophylaxis for HIV exposed infants, encouragement of hospital delivery, and the start of ART at the time of diagnosis of every HIV-positive person may all reduce the transmission of vertical HIV infection.","Belachew, Amare; Tewabe, Tilahun; Malede, Gizat Abinet",Trop Med Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7572247/,269

In this paper, we first provide a brief exposition of the simplest version of the selfish life-cycle model and then survey the literature on household saving and bequest behavior in Japan in order to answer this question. The paper finds that almost all of the available evidence suggests that the selfish life-cycle model applies to at least some extent in all countries but that there is more consistent support for this model in Japan than in the United States and other countries. It then explores possible explanations for why the life-cycle model is more consistently supported in Japan than in other countries, attributing this finding to government policies, institutional factors, economic factors, demographic factors, and cultural factors. Finally, it shows that the findings of the paper have many important implications for economic modeling and for government tax and expenditure policies.","Horioka, Charles Yuji",Rev Econ Househ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7574674/,269

The Summer 2020 Economic Forecast projects that the euro area economy will contract by 8.7% in 2020. The coronavirus crisis is expected to push the general government deficit to about 8.5% of GDP this year. Even in an optimistic V-shaped recovery scenario with a GDP growth rate of 6.1% in 2021 due to the temporary nature of lockdown measures taken in 2020, the headline deficit is expected to decrease to about 3.5% of GDP. Furthermore, both the downturn and the rebound of economic activity are expected to be asymmetric across member states, exposing entrenched divergences. The recent outlook highlights the problem of pro-cyclical revisions of potential output and output gap estimates. Some economists warn that the current fiscal framework may lead to pro-cyclical and thus destabilising fiscal policies, a problem encountered in Southern Europe during the European sovereign debt crisis that has implications for the entire European Union.

If so, the cost-effective COP data measurements can be used to indicate the level of postural stability and lower limb muscle activity. The Hilbert–Huang Transform method was used to analyse the data from the experimental designed to examine the correlation between lower-limb muscles and postural stability. We randomly selected 24 university students to participate in eight scenarios and simultaneously measured their COP and EMG signals during the experiments. The Empirical Mode Decomposition was used to identify the intrinsic-mode functions (IMF) that can distinguish between the COP and EMG at different states. Subsequently, similarity indices and synchronization analyses were used to calculate the correlation between the lower-limb muscle strength and the postural stability. The IMF5 of the COP signals and the IMF6 of the EMG signals were not significantly different and the average frequency was 0.8 Hz, with a range of 0–2 Hz. When the postural stability was poor, the COP and EMG had a high synchronization with index values within the range of 0.010–0.015. With good postural stability, the synchronization indices were between 0.006 and 0.080 and both exhibited low synchronization. The COP signals and the low frequency EMG signals were highly correlated. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the COP may provide enough information on postural stability without the EMG data.","Wang, Chien-Chih; Jiang, Bernard C.; Huang, Pei-Min",Entropy (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7512838/,269

The cohort was split between LTC residents (n=32, mean age 77.8 yrs, age range 48-97), and the LTC staff (n=26, mean age 41.3 yrs, range 23-61); the age difference between groups was statistically significant (P<0.001). Serum IgG measurement was quantitative over 5 orders of magnitude (0.6-1250µg/mL) and IgM was qualitative, measured with sandwich ELISA; NAbs were measured with surrogate virus neutralization assay (sVNT) competition ELISA (both Genscript). The convalescent older adult LTC patients were fully immuno-competent and showed no significant difference in IgG, IgM, or NAbs compared to the younger staff group. All older adults developed NAbs and were positive for either IgG, IgM, or both. All study participants were then grouped by age range and IgG, IgM, and NAbs compared between the following groups: ≤ 50 yrs old(n=20), 51-60(n=6), 61-70(n=8), 71-80(n=14), 81-90(n=6), and ≥91(n=4). There was no significant difference in immune response parameters between the age groups. Furthermore, repeat testing at 3 months on a subset of participants showed that NAbs, IgG and IgM persist.

A case control study was conducted with people ages 65 and greater, with an established diagnosis of dementia prior to March 2020. Compared with an active control group - participants without a current dementia diagnosis who self-reported mild cognitive shifts and who also received active grief-informed therapies – offer supporting evidence of a strong factor of efficacy for including grief therapy in services offered to people living with dementia. Evidence of a continued point improvement on both the brief grief questionnaire and inventory of complicated grief, as well as decreased severity of items on NPI-Q corroborate this therapeutic recommendation. Now more than ever – as people across the globe who are diagnosed with dementia face uncertain ramifications of previous grief episodes, ones that have potentially been reignited by the flames of COVID-19 – therapists must foster safe spaces informed by novel therapeutic grief approaches. In any just society, emphasis on therapeutic techniques that allow participants to ventilate their feelings and fears, as well as promote movement along a continuum from isolation to intimacy, must prevail.

We intravenously injected mice with Cy7 or 68-Gallium ((68)Ga) labeled mouse albumin and imaged using optical imaging (OI)/CT and PET. We observed significantly increased lung levels of Cy7-albumin on 3D OI/CT, which matched the abnormal appearance on microCT. This uptake correlated with fluorescence seen on sectioned lungs. To examine the translational potential of these findings, we radiolabeled albumin with (68)Ga. We found that in mice with LPS-induced lung injury, (68)Ga-albumin PET correlated with our optical imaging findings and demonstrated abnormal activity in the lung fields, indicative of abnormal epithelial permeability. These findings indicate (68)Ga-albumin can be utilized as a sensitive translational radiotracer for quantifying the abnormal epithelial permeability that is seen in various lung pathologies, including COVID-19 induced pneumonia and ARDS. The ability to use Cy7-albumin 3D OI/CT imaging as a preclinical translational surrogate for (68)Ga-albumin offers an accessible high throughput means to rapidly screen potential therapeutics against lung diseases that clinically manifest with endothelial permeability.","Molotkov, Andrei; Bhatt, Nikunj; Doubrovin, Mikhail; Castrillon, John; Massa, Christopher; Gerber, Adam; D’Armiento, Jeanine; Goldklang, Monica; Mintz, Akiva",Mol Biomed,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7749789/,269

The challenge for this burning issue pertinent to repurposed medicines which prevent novel coronavirus is of immense concern for all scientists around the globe until the arrival of the vaccine. METHODS: Because of the global high priority rating on the search for the repurposed drugs which outfits clinical suitability to SARS-CoV-2, a unique theoretical methodology is proposed. The approach is based on explorations of biothermodynamics computed via molecular dynamics, root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), radius of gyration (Rg) and interactions. This unique methodology is tested for umifenovir/dexamethasone drugs on (SARS-CoV-2) main protease. RESULTS: This theoretical exploration not only suggested the presence of strong interactions between (SARS-CoV-2 + umifenovir/dexamethasone) but also emphasized the clinical suitability of dexamethasone over umifenovir to treat SARS-CoV-2. This supremacy of dexamethasone is well supported by the results of global clinical trials and COVID-19 therapeutic approved management guidelines of countries. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, this work will pave a way for incremental advancement towards future design and development of more specific inhibitors for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.","Nayeem, Sk.

In practice, numerous hotels are adopting AI-based service technologies, but it is still in its early stage to provide guidelines for the overall service strategy for this technology. Therefore, this study conducted a study on the failure of AI based self-service technologies (SSTs), service recovery, and the psychological expectations of customers’ SST. An online survey was conducted on respondents who had experience using AI based SSTs, and a total of 370 responses were used for analysis. As a result of structural model analysis through AMOS, it was found that adequate service recovery and low expectations for SSTs were satisfied with SSTs and hotels as a result, even if service failures were experienced. These findings provide specific practical guidelines for many hotels promoting AI-based service automation.","QianTing, Lu; Chung, Hee Chung; Chung, Namho",Information and Communication Technologies in Tourism 2021,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7798077/,269
44821,Corona-Impfpflicht für Praxispersonal?,2021-01-29,"CONTEXT: Big Data Analytics is a rapidly emerging IT practice whose applications offer benefits for a wide variety of business areas across an organisation. Given the wide scope of applications, the many types of processing involved, including those for purposes not yet foreseen, and the inherent privacy concerns resulting from collecting and storing personal data, the newly introduced General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) poses specific challenges for safeguarding the security and protection of big data. These challenges are not limited to the IT function but extend across the entire organisation. This raises the question whether Enterprise Architecture Management (EAM), as an approach for ensuring the coherence, strategic alignment and focus on value creation of all organisational resources, offers guidance for addressing those challenges in a holistic manner, and thus provides a fruitful ground for developing an approach for complying to GDPR requirements in a Big Data context. OBJECTIVE: This study surveys the state-of-the-art in research on security, privacy, and protection of big data. The focus is on investigating which specific issues and challenges have been identified and whether these have been linked to GDPR requirements. Further, it examines whether previous research has investigated the potential of EAM in addressing those challenges and what the main findings of those studies are. METHOD: We used Systematic Mapping Review (SMR), which is a methodology for literature review aimed at surveying the state-of-the-art in a research field as it is documented in the scientific literature. Further, we used Template Analysis, which is a thematic analysis technique, for coding the texts of the selected papers, classifying the research studies, and interpreting the different themes addressed in the literature. RESULTS: Our study indicates that only few researchers have explored the use of EAM practices in relation to data security and protection in a Big Data context. We further identified seven trends within the areas under consideration that could be subjects for further research. CONCLUSIONS: Our study does not invalidate the potential of EAM to help addressing GDPR requirements in a Big Data context. However, how EAM practices may contribute to risk management and data governance in environments where big data are being processed, is still a huge research gap, which we intend to address in our future research.

It is found that the species list of the zooplankton has included 141 species over 50 years: it consisted of a total of 98 taxa in 1965 and 104 taxa in 2012–2019. The results of analyzing the spatiotemporal abundance distribution of the zooplankton and its taxonomic groups are presented. A significant increase in abundance (on account of copepods) and changes in the taxonomic structure of zooplankton have been revealed in the lower parts of the study water area. In 2019, changes in the structure-forming complex of zooplankton were noted for the first time over the study period. It is found that species diversity reaches high values in waters classified as “heavily polluted” and “dirty,” which is evidence for a complex structure of zooplankton communities. The main factor influencing the horizontal distribution of the zooplankton abundance is the dissolved oxygen content of water.","Imant, E. N.; Novoselov, A.

RECENT FINDINGS: Delirium is a form of acute brain dysfunction that results in significant mortality and morbidity for older emergency department (ED) patients. Delirium is frequently missed by healthcare providers, but monitoring for this syndrome using brief delirium assessments may improve recognition. Once delirium is diagnosed, emergency medicine providers’ primary goal is to perform a comprehensive history and physical examination to uncover the underlying etiology for delirium. This includes obtaining history from a collateral historian and obtaining an accurate medication history. If posssible, emergency physicians (EPs) should treat the medical etiology that precipitated the delirium. If agitated, non-pharmacologic interventions such that minimize the use of tethers are preferred. Pharmacologic agents such as antipsychotic medications should be used as a last resort. SUMMARY: Delirium is a common geriatric emergency and requires the EP to assess, diagnose, evaluate, prevent, and treat. Delirium is a key geriatric syndrome that geriatric ED providers should routinely screen for. A strong emphasis is on the widespread use of delirium screening, followed by prevention and treatment efforts.","Lee, Sangil; Angel, Clay; Han, Jin H.",Curr Emerg Hosp Med Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971395/,269

The cataclysms that have occurred recently have affected the world economy. The world has ceased to be balanced. Business froze in fear of inevitable bankruptcy, unemployment and ruin. Political changes in Russia, which began in January 2020, the drop in oil prices, the collapse of the ruble, which followed the relative stability of the Russian national currency and reached the pandemic country, negatively affected business in the country. The development of urgent state measures to support small and medium-sized enterprises is the only way to maintain its viability. These measures should be based on a clear regulatory framework that does not allow vague interpretations and legal incidents. Using the comparative legal method, it is necessary to draw the experience of those countries in which there is a state policy in relation to small and medium-sized businesses, which is a system of socio-economic actions built on the principle of ensuring the favorable development of this sector of the economy and to develop measures that can preserve it in conditions of prevailing force majeure. The aim of this work is a comparative analysis of measures taken by the world community and Russia to support small and medium-sized businesses during the economic crisis caused by Covid19. Particular attention is paid to the legislative justification of measures taken in Russia and the identification of shortcomings of the newly adopted normative legal acts.","Fadeev, A.

Comparative literature stresses that different types of parliaments emphasise different staffing structures in accordance with the varying importance attached to different parliamentary functions. Therefore, the arrangement of the UK House of Commons parliamentary administration is at the very heart of parliamentary democracy. The effective work environment of parliamentary staff not only contributes to parliamentary strengthening but also makes parliaments more gender-just workplaces. To date though, analyses of gendering in parliamentary administrations, beyond self-reporting, are few and far between. The chapter fills gaps by exploring how changes to MPs’ work can have knock-on effects for parliamentary staff. It explores how staff are rotated through different departments and how gender was rendered (in)visible in a high-profile recruitment process. It then explores Workplace Equality Networks that were going through a process of institutionalisation at the time of research and may be critical actors for gender equality in the parliamentary workplace. Finally, the chapter explores how members of the parliamentary administration negotiate discourses of service and stewardship in public engagement and in how they navigate inadequate bullying and harassment arrangements.","Miller, Cherry M.",Gendering the Everyday in the UK House of Commons,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971577/,269

Their focus on the local dimension of conflicts—often neglected by nations’ peace initiatives—matched with a more “neutral” image and a proneness to long-term involvement, make cities particularly praised an effective partners in these complex settings. Although, a few structural weaknesses strongly limit such action, namely the lack of an army to secure the zone and protect their officers on the ground, or the limited tools to acquire information on foreign conflicts. As a result, cities often need to cooperate with other actors involved in order to avoid risks of limited or even counter-productive impact.

In this work we designed and developed a computer simulator to enable the study of infectious diseases evolutions, the simulator imitates random movements and positions of a given number of citizens in a closed space. It takes into account several parameters: contamination ratio of the disease, contaminated ratio of population, and mask-wearing ratio. We also elaborated some experiments for studying the impact of the contamination ratio over the disease spreading, as a result for a sample of 100 citizens in a closed place, we used a combination of simulations for the aforementioned 3 parameters. The results show that there’s no significant impact of the contamination ratio of the disease over the number of contaminations per each generation, although it has an impact on the propagation speed.","Almechkor, Mohamed; Aachak, Lotfi El; Elouaai, Fatiha; Bouhorma, Mohammed",Innovations in Smart Cities Applications Volume 4,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972560/,269

In the last decades, several works demonstrated how configurational properties of the street network and morphological descriptors of the urban built environment are significantly related to store distribution. However, two main challenges still need to be addressed. On the one side, the combined effect of different urban form properties should be considered providing a holistic study of the urban form and its relationship to retail patterns. On the other, analytical approaches should consider the discrete, skewed and zero-inflated nature of the micro-retail distribution. To overcome these limitations, this work compares two sophisticated modelling procedure: Penalised Count Regression and Machine Learning approaches. While the former is specifically conceived to account for retail count distribution, the latter can capture non-linear behaviours in the data. The two modelling procedures are implemented on the same large dataset of street-based measures describing the urban form of the French Riviera. The outcomes of the two modelling approaches are compared in terms of prediction performance and selection frequencies of the most recurrent variables among the implemented models.","Araldi, Alessandro; Venerandi, Alessandro; Fusco, Giovanni",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974707/,269

To mitigate the development of this virus, many countries have announced the closure of their educational institutions. The closure decision has left many institutions unable to select the appropriate technology for delivering the learning materials to their students. To assist those institutions attempting to digitize their learning during this pandemic, the main aim of this research is to review the leading technologies used for delivering the learning materials by considering the experiences of the most infected countries at the time of conducting this study. Through a mind map, we have concluded that the most leading technologies used for online learning are video conferencing, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), educational national portals, recorded video lectures, cloud computing platforms, Microsoft Teams, and educational TV. We have also discussed the main challenges that might encounter the delivery of online learning.

There are collective concerns about effectively equipping younger students for the demands of practice and inoculating them against premature burnout in this resource-strapped environment. The many challenges facing social work educators are presented. Nonetheless, the programme has remained buoyant and has been recognized for its contribution to the sustainable development of practitioners and service provision. It is hoped that by outlining the challenges for social work educators at SAUWI, educators in other regions might gain a deeper understanding of some of their own challenges and come up with innovative ways to address them.

Official statistics compete with other sources and often arrive at the consumer after various intermediaries have imposed their own angles. A key aspect is the question of who the statistics are for. The term “user” is not necessarily well-defined. Identifying users and indeed potential users may not be straightforward. But identifying the users is a pre-requisite for producing something useful. It is not enough to produce the statistics in the hope that, once they exist, they will become useful. The diversity of users has resulted in a lack of consistent process about what to include in a nation’s set of official statistics. We focus on an authoritative report that sought to align better the metrics measuring wellbeing with what actually contributed to quality of life. While the report attracted a great deal of attention, there is little evidence that the construction of alternative measures has had much practical impact. The UN’s Sustainable Development Goals are a further attempt to move in the same direction, although they are not without their critics, not least because of the sheer scale of the ambition implicit in them.

The Imitation Game is a serious game to drive design decision at urban scale versus sustainable scenarios, and it is currently under testing with the students of the Construction and Sustainability Design Studio. The hypothesis is to make the game available for citizens and designers in a coming future. The aim of the research was to define a simplified procedure to roughly estimate the effect of the behavior of people in a given area in terms of land necessary to support their lifestyle. To calculate the amount of land required, all the consumptions have been converted into biomass (wood, biofuel, food, …) and then into land surface to produce such biomass. Each player plays referring to a different census section of the town and has an amount of money related to the consumptions in the census section (heating, transportation, electricity, etc.). Players have the ability to modify their behavior that reflects people lifestyle, which means that any change in the player’s personal behavior affects the results of the play, as if a percentage of the population adopted that behavior. The Imitation Game was structured as a board game in which players (students) can gain extra points performing specific activities (i.e., reading books on the topic, performing activities), can play technological choices (available as cards in a deck of cards) and can modify their behavior to affect the final results.

In distributed systems, e.g. computer networks or mobile networks, the introduction of self-healing capabilities poses some challenges, mainly when software-based networks, e.g. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV), are involved. Such networks impose new control and management layers, and the adoption of self-healing functions means that all layers must be considered. In this paper, we present the challenges of self-healing in the scope of SDN and NFV, by revising the self-healing concept in computer and mobile networks, and by presenting the thorough difference between a system that applies fault tolerance from one that applies self-healing functions. We also introduce a framework for solving these challenges, by describing four use cases of self-healing, considering control, management, and data layers. The use cases focus on maintaining the health of the network at run-time, considering control, management, and infrastructure layers.

50447,Creating Pious Identity: Margaret Hoby’s Reformist Diary,2021-02-28,"Posttransplant infections are common in allograft recipients, largely due to the immunosuppressive therapy required to maintain graft function. Infection is derived from the environment, the recipient, and the transplanted organ. Procedures have been developed to minimize the risk of posttransplant infection, including organ donor screening, prophylactic antimicrobial therapies, and monitoring of recipients for common infections. These approaches have dramatically increased the success of clinical transplantation. The requirement for immunosuppressive therapy in xenotransplantation from swine, or from other species, necessitates similar safeguards. In addition, xenotransplantation poses the added challenge of more limited data on the microbiology of swine used for commercial purposes and, specifically, with the impact of immunosuppression of swine or humans carrying viable swine tissues. Significant advances in knowledge have been achieved which allow procedures that enhance the safety of allotransplantation to be applied in xenotransplantation. This includes screening of source animals and organs for potential human pathogens, antimicrobial prophylaxis, and monitoring of recipients for infections – both of xenogeneic origin and from the host and the environment. Monitoring for specific pathogens in donors or organs may allow the exclusion of common organisms comparable to those causing infection in allograft recipients, such as porcine cytomegalovirus and porcine lymphotropic herpesvirus, mycobacteria, molds, and parasites. Pig-specific pathogens, such as porcine endogenous retroviruses or circoviruses, may be excluded from donors or monitored in recipients. Novel monitoring strategies may supplement these pathogen-specific assays using advanced sequencing modalities, including broad-range molecular probes, microarrays, and high-throughput pyrosequencing. Xenotransplantation provides the unique opportunity to examine approaches to microbiological safety in transplantation while providing a supply of organs for clinical application.","Fishman, Jay A.",Clinical Xenotransplantation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991128/,269
50703,Architectural Decisions as the Basis for Sustainable Mobility,2021-03-26,"Nepal is rapidly urbanizing. Until 2014, only 20% of the total population lived in urban areas, but in 2015, over 65% of people were classified as urban dwellers with the promulgation of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nepal (FRN). Many rural areas are annexed together to meet the population thresholds of some territories in order to classify them as municipals. As of 2017, many of the existing local level political units (which were over 3700) have been combined together reducing the local political units to 753 in total. Until 2014, there were only 105 urban units, but when local political units were decreased to 753 as per the FRN, the number of urban units jumped from 105 to 293 with 276 municipalities, 11 sub-metropolises, and 6 metropolises. However, many of these so classified urban areas are characterized by ruralopolises where people living in rural settings within the legally defined urban areas are competing for the limited facilities of the urban cores. Despite such competition for limited resources/facilities, many of the ruralopolises are aspiring to becoming “smart cities.” However, political leaders and urban planners responsible for the planning of these ruralopolises have been struggling to have real-time geospatial data, one of the essential components of “smart cities.” A “smart city” is an integrated system in which human and social capitals interact, using technology-based solutions. It efficiently achieves sustainable and resilient development and helps maintain a high urban life quality based on a multi-stakeholders’ partnership. The “smart city” initiatives need real-time data that uses auto-sensor state-of-the-art technology. The economic outcomes of a “smart city” initiative results in the simplification of daily working schedules such as bus routing, waste disposal, creation of businesses, jobs, and infrastructure. The brain of a “smart city” includes the virtual real-time data center-fed by an automated sensor network that regulates kiosks, parking meters, cameras, smart phones, medical devices, social networks, and bus routings. Gathering of real-time big data with high accuracy becomes a huge challenge. However, it will be sustainable and cost-effective to engage various stakeholders to gather quality data and develop models to examine the utilities of such data.

METHODS: We fine-tuned neural networks pretrained on ImageNet and applied a twice transfer learning approach, using NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset as an intermediate step. We also suggested a novelty called output neuron keeping, which changes the twice transfer learning technique. In order to clarify the modus operandi of the models, we used Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to generate heatmaps. RESULTS: We were able to reach test accuracy of 100% on our test dataset. Twice transfer learning and output neuron keeping showed promising results improving performances, mainly in the beginning of the training process. Although LRP revealed that words on the X-rays can influence the networks’ predictions, we discovered this had only a very small effect on accuracy. CONCLUSION: Although clinical studies and larger datasets are still needed to further ensure good generalization, the state-of-the-art performances we achieved show that, with the help of artificial intelligence, chest X-rays can become a cheap and accurate auxiliary method for COVID-19 diagnosis. Heatmaps generated by LRP improve the interpretability of the deep neural networks and indicate an analytical path for future research on diagnosis.

SETTING: The interviews and focus group discussions were conducted in English and at a private location that was convenient for the participants in Johannesburg, Gauteng. METHODS: This qualitative study used a phenomenological approach. Ten individual interviews were conducted with registered homoeopathy student interns (HSIs) from the UJ. The central question: ‘What has your experience been regarding language barriers between you and your patients at the UJ Homoeopathy clinics?’ was asked and responses were recorded and transcribed for later analysis. The interview results were presented to a focus group for discussion to validate findings that arose from the analysis and to provide an opportunity to add any insight, comment or recommendations that were not expressed in individual interviews and verification of emergent themes. RESULTS: Participants described how language barriers create challenges in understanding between patients and HSIs. Descriptions of the experiences of the intrapersonal and interpersonal effects that are associated with language barriers were provided. Participants also described the influence of language barriers on the various aspects of the health service process. Finally, participants described the mitigation of language barriers through various strategies. CONCLUSION: Participants reported their experiences of language barriers as challenging.

Research over the decade provided significant insights into some of the associated mechanisms including uterine capacity, placental efficiency, deficits in vasculature, and immune-inflammatory alterations at the maternal-fetal interface. Pigs have unique epitheliochorial placentation where maternal and fetal layers lay in opposition without any invasion. This has provided researchers opportunities to accurately tease out some of the mechanisms associated with maternal-fetal interface adaptations to the constantly evolving needs of a developing conceptus. Another unique feature of porcine pregnancy is the conceptus derived recruitment of immune cells during the window of conceptus attachment. These immune cells in turn participate in pregnancy associated vascular changes and contribute toward tolerance to the semi-allogeneic fetus. However, the precise mechanism of how maternal-fetal cells communicate during the critical times in gestation is not fully understood. Recently, it has been established that bi-directional communication between fetal trophoblasts and maternal cells/tissues is mediated by extracellular vesicles (EVs) including exosomes. These EVs are detected in a variety of tissues and body fluids and their role has been described in modulating several physiological and pathological processes including vascularization, immune-modulation, and homeostasis. Recent literature also suggests that these EVs (exosomes) carry cargo (nucleic acids, protein, and lipids) as unique signatures associated with some of the pregnancy associated pathologies. In this review, we provide overview of important mechanisms in porcine pregnancy success and failure and summarize current knowledge about the unique cargo containing biomolecules in EVs.

The major population we serve at Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center (KJMC) are underprivileged with many of them having multiple comorbidities. Methods: This is a retrospective study wherein patients, admitted from February 2020 to April 2020 with hyperglycemia, were selected and divided into 2 groups based on presence or absence of C-19. Data include demographics, comorbidities, blood glucose level, serum osmolality, serum bicarbonate, anion gap, acute kidney injury (AKI), serum creatinine, ICU admission, length of stay (LOS) and mortality. Data were analyzed using descriptive study and T-test. Results: 100 patients were included in the C-19 group (CG) and 88 patients were included in the Non C-19 group (NCG). Major comorbidities were similar in both groups including HTN, DM, CKD followed by ESRD. Mean age of patients (years) was 65.68 in CG and 61.17 in NCG. 61% were male in CG and 53.41% were male in NCG. 16% and 9% developed DKA and HHS in CG, and 13.64% and 6.82% developed DKA and HHS in NCG respectively. 15% in CG had combined DKA & HHS and 3.41% had same in NCG. Mean blood glucose level (mg/dl) was 541.6 in CG and 460.0 in NCG (p=0.03). Mean serum osmolality (mOsm/kg) was 335.7 (SD±41.01) in CG and 317.1 (SD±30.54) in NCG (p=0.01). Mean serum bicarbonate (mEq/L) was 17.73 (SD±6.31) in CG and 21.46 (SD±5.94) in NCG (p<0.0001). Mean anion gap was 17.93 (SD±7.6) in CG and 13.10 (SD±7.2) in NCG (p<0.0001). 56% in CG and 37% in NCG developed AKI respectively (p=0.01). Mean serum creatinine (mg/dl) was 4.22 in CG and 1.65 in NCG (p=0.004). 55% of CG were admitted to ICU and 34% of NCG were admitted to ICU (p=0.003). Median LOS (days) in discharged patients was 8 in CG and 5 in NCG (p=0.02). Mortality was 40% in CG and 3.41% in NCG (p<0.0001). 12 patients in CG and 2 patients in NCG developed new-onset diabetes. In the subset of DKA, interestingly, mean age (years) was 61.63 (SD±17.73) in CG and 39.67 in NCG (SD±13.39) (p=0.001). Conclusion: In our study, patients in the CG carry worse laboratory parameters, unfavorable clinical outcomes and strikingly higher mortality. We discovered increased incidence of new-onset diabetes and elderly DKA in CG. In an inner city population like ours, the burden of DM with significant social and health care disparities is quite severe. Diabetic patients with concurrent C-19 infection can have particularly negative outcomes and C-19 possibly damages the pancreatic islets resulting in acute hyperglycemic crisis. Further research on larger population is required.

In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, we need to reshape the way we look into Outpatient clinic appointments. AIM: To review all clinic referrals to UGI surgical clinic and highlight any potential pathways that can improve waiting times and patient experience. METHOD: Patients referred to UGI clinic over 2 months were collected from Iclip, EPR and EDM. Post-discharge appointments and DNA’s were excluded. Data collected included time from referral to clinic, type of referral, symptoms, investigations, potential pathway, first clinic outcome, and appropriateness of referral. RESULTS: Total of 147 referrals analyzed. Time from referral to clinic appointment is 51 days. GP referrals represented 73% while the rest from consultant colleagues. The most common symptoms were biliary colic and GORD. OGD and PH manometry were the most common investigations requested. The most common first outcome was pre investigate and clinic follow up. Two potential pathways identified are Biliary colic and GORD pathway. 90% of referrals were appropriate. CONCLUSIONS: Biliary colic pathway and GORD pathway are 2 potential pathways that can cut off waiting times for clinic appointments and improve patient experience in outpatient clinics.","Abouelazayem, M; Belchita, R; Wan, A",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135872/,269

PURPOSE: To compare the LB in urban and rural patients suffering from chronic coronary syndrom (CCS) METHODS: 250 outpatients suffering from CCS were invited during the 6th week of the 1st C19 lockdown to answer to a phone-call questionnaire. RESULTS: 220 questionnaires were fit for analysis, of whom about 1/4 declared a psychologic impairment; people staying at home in urban zones trended to be more impacted. Unhealthier behaviours including cigarette smoking, decrease in physical activity and increase in screentime were common, especially in patients from urban zones. Telehealth partially counterbalanced limitation in care access and none declared discontinuation of medications.

54387,ECG Paper Record Digitization and Diagnosis Using Deep Learning,2021-06-15,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic completely changed the world during the past year, but its’ greatest impact was on healthcare system. As inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic conditions, and patients are in constant interaction with healthcare system and are treated with immunosuppressive therapies, they present a particularly vulnerable group of patients during the pandemic. METHODS: Aim of this study was to survey IBD patients’ opinion on the impact of COVID-19 on their mental health, availability and quality of healthcare and their opinion on vaccination. We created a questionnaire that was posted to web based IBD patient group that gather patients from our geographical, Adriatic-Balkan, region (Croatia, Bosnia and Hercegovina, Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro). Patients answered questions anonymously. Answers were created as yes/no, in grades from 1 (no impact/fear) to 5 (very large impact/very severe fear) or by choosing one of the offered answers. In total, 167 responses were received between December 2020 and March 2021, and were analyzed by descriptive statistics. RESULTS: A total of 167 IBD patients filled the questionnaire, of which 116 (69,5%) were female. Median age was 36 years (min. 15, max. 62 ys). Most patients did not have COVID-19 (82,6%). A little over half of patients believe that IBD patients are at higher risk of developing COVID-19 (n=97, 58,1%). COVID-19 pandemic has a moderate to large impact on their mental health in majority of patients (n=106, 63,5%) and 99 patients (59,3%) feel moderate to severe fear for their own health because of the pandemic. Most of the information about COVID-19 patients found on the internet (44,3%), from patients’ associations (26,3%) and from their IBD doctor (22,8%). Same number of patients (n=48, 28,7%) feel no impact or very large impact of pandemic on availability to IBD team. Most of patients did not change their IBD therapy during the pandemic (86,8%), and majority (62,3%) felt there was no impact of pandemic on the availability to their therapy. Almost half of patients (49,7%) feel that the quality of healthcare system is worse since the beginning of the pandemic. More than half of patients (57,5%) do not want to be vaccinated against COVID-19. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic had a moderate to large impact on mental health in majority of patients. It is particularly important that patients receive correct information about COVID-19 from medical professionals, and patients’ association groups are very useful channel for patient education that should be used more. More than half of patients do not want to be vaccinated, showing the importance of patient education even more.","Borzan, V; Orsic Fric, V; Borzan, B",J Crohns Colitis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8194722/,269

Cooperatives are hybrid organizations that maximize value, instead of profit. They are owned, governed, and controlled by their members. They are more resilient than the conventional enterprises in times of crisis, thanks to their peculiar governance characteristics that ensure member centrality. Next to member centrality, the embeddedness of cooperatives in their local environment and a global movement enhances mission centrality as well as trust and solidarity among their members, local communities, and other cooperatives.","Billiet, Adrien; Dufays, Frédéric; Friedel, Stefanie; Staessens, Matthias",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8206912/,269
54727,Bidens Fiskalpolitik — ein Vorbild für Deutschland?,2021-06-22,"Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a hormone secreted from fully differentiated osteoblasts and osteocytes that inhibits phosphate reabsorption by kidney proximal tubules. The full-length (i.e., intact) protein mediates FGF23 endocrine functions, while endoproteolytic cleavage at a consensus cleavage sequence for the proprotein convertases (PCs) inactivates FGF23. Two PCs, furin and PC5, were shown to cleave FGF23 in vitro at RHTR(179)↓, but whether they are fulfilling this function in vivo is currently unknown. To address this question, we used here mice lacking either or both furin and PC5 in cell-specific manners and mice lacking the paired basic amino acid-cleaving enzyme 4 (PACE4) in all cells. Our analysis shows that furin inactivation in osteoblasts and osteocytes results in a 25% increase in circulating intact FGF23, without any significant impact on serum phosphate levels, whether mice are maintained on a normal or a low phosphate diet. Under conditions of iron deficiency, FGF23 is normally processed in control mice, but its processing is impaired in mice lacking furin in osteoblasts and osteocytes. In contrast, FGF23 is normally cleaved following erythropoietin or IL-1β injections in mice lacking furin or both furin and PC5, and in PACE4-deficient mice. Altogether, these studies suggest that furin is only partially responsible for FGF23 cleavage under certain conditions in vivo. The processing of FGF23 may therefore involve the redundant action of multiple PCs or of other peptidases in osteoblasts, osteocytes and hematopoietic cells.","Al Rifai, Omar; Susan-Resiga, Delia; Essalmani, Rachid; Creemers, John W.

An effective way to improve this situation would be to improve students’ digital competence. In order to do so, teachers must have competent digital skills themselves and also be able to teach them. To determine teachers’ level of digital competence, the Spanish adaptation of the European Framework for Digital Competence of Educators was used to analyse the self-assessment responses of teachers in training at the Faculty of Education and Sport Sciences in Melilla, Spain. Several quantitative techniques were used to analyse data collected from a questionnaire based on the items in the framework. Indicators were given to each competence using a factor analysis to contrast differences between undergraduate and postgraduate students. Correlations between some of the students’ characteristics and the competences were estimated using OLS. The results show students’ self-assessment level of digital competence in different areas and differences between the bachelor’s and master’s programmes. Digital competence gaps were also detected in teacher training, especially in security. The conclusions highlight the need to improve digital security and facilitate a higher level of digital skills in line with the framework. Indeed, more hours of training in digital competence are required while taking into account the educational context and the technological, pedagogical and content knowledge needed to teach. Equally, the same skills must be developed by educators in order for them to transmit digital competence to their students and support them in educational centres.","García-Vandewalle García, José Manuel; García-Carmona, Marina; Trujillo Torres, Juan Manuel; Moya Fernández, Pablo",Tech Know Learn,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8277570/,269

Our empirical analysis builds on difference-in-difference and dynamic event study estimation for panel data. Synthetic control method is applied as a robustness check. While our findings generally do not point to significant treatment effects for the full sample of match locations, we find some noteworthy exceptions. Districts hosting first league matches with spectator attendance above the median (> 6,300 persons) and, particularly, matches without strict face mask requirements experienced a significant relative rise in incidence rates 14 days after the match. We also find that intra-district mobility increases on match days in treated districts, highlighting the significance of professional football matches as mobility-based infection transmission channel.","Breidenbach, Philipp; Mitze, Timo",Econom J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8411384/,269

Dès le début de la pandémie quelques cas de thromboses artérielles inhabituelles, comme des thrombus de l’aorte associés à des embolies cérébrales ou périphériques inhabituelles ont été décrits. Du point de vue épidémiologique, il est plus difficile de trouver une association évidente notamment en ce qui concerne les accidents vasculaires cérébraux et l’infarctus du myocarde. En effet, dans les études épidémiologiques il est apparu que le confinement a plutôt eu pour conséquence une diminution des hospitalisations pour ces deux pathologies, diminution qui pourrait être due à la peur de se faire hospitaliser durant cette période ou à une moindre incidence réelle. Ainsi, la fréquence des hospitalisations pour infarctus du myocarde a diminué dans de nombreuses études de l’ordre de 30 %. Certains ont proposé que la diminution de la pollution liée au confinement pouvait avoir participé pour une part à cette baisse d’hospitalisation. En tout état de cause, ce qui ressort clairement de la littérature est qu’en cas de thromboses artérielles hospitalisées, les cas étaient plus sévères avec plus de risques de complications lors de la phase aiguë et lors des tentatives thérapeutiques de désobstruction, avec un risque de re-thrombose élevé.

59665,Attitudes of optometrists in the UK and Ireland to Digital Eye Strain and approaches to assessment and management.,2021-09-21,"UNLABELLED Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against HIV-1 are generated during HIV-1-infection but have not yet been elicited by immunization with recombinant forms of the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env; the target of anti-HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies). A particular type of bNAb targets the CD4-binding site (CD4-BS) region of Env. These antibodies are derived from a limited number of VH/VL genes and can bind to and neutralize diverse HIV-1 strains. Recent reports have demonstrated the limited potential of Env to activate B cells expressing the germline B cell receptor (BCR) forms of anti-CD4-BS bNAbs. A potential reason for the lack of elicitation of anti-CD4-BS bNAbs by Env immunogens is the absence of stimulation of naive B cells expressing the germline BCRs of such antibodies. Several bNAbs have been isolated from HIV-1-infected subjects that target other structurally conserved regions of Env. How frequently Env immunogens stimulate the germline BCRs that give rise to bNAbs that target Env regions other than the CD4-BS is not well understood. Here, we investigated the interactions between diverse Envs and the BCRs of known bNAbs targeting not only the CD4-BS but also conserved elements of the second and third variable Env regions. Our results indicate that Env is generally ineffective in engaging germline BCRs of bNAbs irrespective of their epitope target. Potentially, this is the result of viral evolutionary mechanisms adopted to escape broadly neutralizing antibody responses. Our results also suggest that a single Env capable of activating germline BCRs that target distinct Env epitopes will be very difficult to identify or to design. IMPORTANCE Broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 are thought to be an important component of the immune responses that a successful vaccine should elicit. Broadly neutralizing antibodies are generated by a subset of those infected by HIV-1, but so far, they have not been generated by immunization with recombinant Envelope (Env, the target of anti-HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies). Here, we provide evidence that the inability of Env to elicit the production of broadly neutralizing antibodies is due to the inability of diverse Envs to engage the germline B cell receptor forms of known broadly neutralizing antibodies.","McGuire, Andrew T; Glenn, Jolene A; Lippy, Adriana; Stamatatos, Leonidas",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.03228-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24352455/,269

The cause of allergic contact dermatitis is related to the use of various materials in oral care practice, such as acrylates, rubber and rubber additives. Essential measures are very important in oral care practice to prevent hand eczema. Various measures are key: adequate skin care with liniments, good skin protection with proper gloves and no-touch techniques. Knowledge of possible allergens and adequate hand hygiene and hand care are crucial to minimize the risk of chronic eczema.","Romijn-Bucarciuc, D; Maessen, G C; Visch, M B",Nederlands tijdschrift voor tandheelkunde,https://doi.org/10.5177/ntvt.2021.06.21032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34096932/,269

61711,Evaluation of the impact of suspended particles on the UV absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) measurements using a submersible UV-Vis spectrophotometer.,2020-10-20,"OBJECTIVES Correctional settings (prisons, jails, detention facilities) provide a unique opportunity to screen for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among correctional populations with a high prevalence of infection. Immigrant detainees are a distinct and poorly described correctional population. The main objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of a national STI screening program for immigrant detainees. METHODS AND MATERIALS We developed an opt-out STI testing program that included electronic health record integration, patient education, and staff member training. We piloted this program from June 22 through August 19, 2018, at 2 detention facilities with different operational requirements and detainee demographic characteristics. We assessed STI test positivity rates, treatment outcomes, estimated cost to conduct testing and counseling, and staff member perceptions of program value and challenges to implementation. RESULTS Of 1041 immigrant detainees approached for testing, 526 (50.5%) declined. Of 494 detainees who were tested, 42 (8.5%) tested positive for at least 1 STI; the percentage positivity rates were 6.7% (n = 33) for chlamydia, 0.8% (n = 4) for syphilis, 0.8% (n = 4) for gonorrhea, 0.6% (n = 3) for hepatitis B, and 0.2% (n = 1) for HIV. The estimated cost to detect any STI ranged from $500 to $961; the estimated cost to identify 1 person infected with HIV ranged from $22 497 to $43 244. Forty of 42 persons who tested positive began treatment before release from custody. Medical staff members had positive views of the program but had concerns about workload. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS STIs are prevalent among immigrant detainees. A routine screening program is feasible if operational aspects are carefully considered and would provide counseling, education, and treatment for this vulnerable population.","Lederman, Edith; Blackwell, Andria; Tomkus, Gina; Rios, Misty; Stephen, Brent; Rivera, Ada; Farabaugh, Philip",Public health reports,https://doi.org/10.1177/0033354920928491; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32735186/,269

64289,Long-term analysis of the relationships between indoor and outdoor fine particulate pollution: A case study using research grade sensors.,2021-02-12,"BACKGROUND At the onset of social distancing, our general surgery residency transitioned its educational curriculum to an entirely virtual format with no gaps in conference offerings. The aim of this study is to examine the feasibility of our evolution to a virtual format and report program attitudes toward the changes. METHODS On March 15, 2020, due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) our institution restricted mass gatherings. We immediately transitioned all lectures to a virtual platform. The cancellation of elective surgeries in April 2020 then created the need for augmented resident education opportunities. We responded by creating additional lectures and implementing a daily conference itinerary. To evaluate the success of the changes and inform the development of future curriculum, we surveyed residents and faculty regarding the changes. Classes and faculty answers were compared for perception of value of the online format. RESULTS Pre-COVID-19, residency-wide educational offerings were concentrated to one half-day per week. Once restrictions were in place, our educational opportunities were expanded to a daily schedule and averaged 16.5 hours/week during April. Overall, 41/63 residents and 25/94 faculty completed the survey. The majority of residents reported an increased ability (56%) or similar ability (34.1%) to attend virtual conferences while 9.9% indicated a decrease. Faculty responses indicated similar effects (64% increased, 32% similar, 4% decreased). PGY-1 residents rated the changes negatively compared to other trainees and faculty. PGY-2 residents reported neutral views and all other trainees and faculty believed the changes positively affected educational value. Comments from PGY1 and 2 residents revealed they could not focus on virtual conferences as it was not ""protected time"" in a classroom and that they felt responsible for patient care during virtual lectures. A majority of both residents (61%) and faculty (84%) reported they would prefer to continue virtual conferences in the future. CONCLUSIONS The necessity for adapting our academic offerings during the COVID-19 era has afforded our program the opportunity to recognize the feasibility of virtual platforms and expand our educational offerings. The majority of participants report stable to improved attendance and educational value. Virtual lectures should still be considered protected time in order to maximize the experience for junior residents.","Nagaraj, Madhuri B; Weis, Holly B; Weis, Joshua J; Cook, Grayden S; Bailey, Lisa W; Shoultz, Thomas H; Farr, Deborah E; AbdelFattah, Kareem R; Dultz, Linda A",The Journal of surgical research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2021.05.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34214902/,269
65078,A Novel Approach to Condition Monitoring of the Cutting Process Using Recurrent Neural Networks.,2020-08-11,"Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a prototypic enveloped animal virus that has been used extensively to study virus entry, replication and assembly due to its broad host range and robust replication properties in a wide variety of mammalian and insect cells. Studies on VSV assembly led to the creation of a recombinant VSV in which the glycoprotein (G) gene was deleted. This recombinant (rVSV-ΔG) has been used to produce VSV pseudotypes containing the envelope glycoproteins of heterologous viruses, including viruses that require high-level biocontainment; however, because the infectivity of rVSV-ΔG pseudotypes is restricted to a single round of replication the analysis can be performed using biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) containment. As such, rVSV-ΔG pseudotypes have facilitated the analysis of virus entry for numerous viral pathogens without the need for specialized containment facilities. The pseudotypes also provide a robust platform to screen libraries for entry inhibitors and to evaluate the neutralizing antibody responses following vaccination. This manuscript describes methods to produce and titer rVSV-ΔG pseudotypes. Procedures to generate rVSV-ΔG stocks and to quantify virus infectivity are also described. These protocols should allow any laboratory knowledgeable in general virological and cell culture techniques to produce successfully replication-restricted rVSV-ΔG pseudotypes for subsequent analysis.","Whitt, Michael A",Journal of virological methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2010.08.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20709108/,269

We investigated different approaches to adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) engraftment into ADM to enhance this process. Lewis rat adipose-derived stem cells were isolated and grafted (3.0 × 10(5) cells) to porcine ADM disks (1.5 mm thick × 6 mm diameter) using either passive onlay or interstitial injection seeding techniques. Following incubation, seeding efficiency and seeded cell viability were measured in vitro. In addition, Eighteen Lewis rats underwent subcutaneous placement of ADM disk either as control or seeded with PKH67 labeled ASCs. ADM disks were seeded with ASCs using either onlay or injection techniques. On day 7 and or 14, ADM disks were harvested and analyzed for host cell infiltration. Onlay and injection techniques resulted in unique seeding patterns; however cell seeding efficiency and cell viability were similar. In-vivo studies showed significantly increased host cell infiltration towards the ASCs foci following injection seeding in comparison to control group (p < 0.05). Moreover, regional endothelial cell invasion was significantly greater in ASCs injected grafts in comparison to onlay seeding (p < 0.05). ADM can successfully be engrafted with ASCs. Interstitial engraftment of ASCs into ADM via injection enhances regional infiltration of host cells and angiogenesis, whereas onlay seeding showed relatively broad and superficial cell infiltration. These findings may be applied to improve the incorporation of avascular engineered constructs.","Komatsu, Issei; Yang, Jun; Zhang, Ying; Levin, L Scott; Erdmann, Detlev; Klitzman, Bruce; Hollenbeck, Scott T",Journal of biomedical materials research.

The prospective observational study including newborn infants in the first 15 min after spontaneous vaginal delivery and uncomplicated transitional period was undertaken. Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO(2)brain) was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy. Arterial oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) and heart rate (HR) were measured on the right wrist by pulse oximetry. rSO(2)brain, SpO(2) and HR measurements were started immediately after birth and were performed in the first 15 min of life. Cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE) was calculated for each minute. Of 145 newborn infants, 16 were included and the gender allocation was 31 females (49.2%) and 32 males (50.8%). rSO(2)brain increased rapidly from 39% (2 min) to 69% (5 min), SpO(2) increased from 72% (2 min) to 96% (14 min) and FTOE showed a significant decrease from minute 2 (0.47) until minute 4 (0.30) and an increase between 8 to 13 min. rSO(2)brain increased rapidly after vaginal delivery. Although SpO(2) increased within the first 14 min after delivery, rSO(2)brain showed no further significant changes after 5 min.

Neuroscientists have typically used tools such as high-speed drills adapted from dentistry to perform these procedures. As the number of technologies available for neuroscientists has increased, the corresponding cranial microsurgery procedures to deploy them have become more complex. Using a robotic tool that automatically performs these procedures could standardize cranial microsurgeries across neuroscience laboratories and democratize the more challenging procedures. We have recently engineered a robotic surgery platform that utilizes principles of computer numerical control (CNC) machining to perform a wide variety of automated cranial procedures. Here, we describe how to adapt, configure and use an inexpensive desktop CNC mill equipped with a custom-built surface profiler for performing CNC-guided microsurgery on mice. Detailed instructions are provided to utilize this 'Craniobot' for performing circular craniotomies for coverslip implantation, large craniotomies for implanting transparent polymer skulls for cortex-wide imaging access and skull thinning for intact skull imaging. The Craniobot can be set up in <2 weeks using parts that cost <$1,500, and we anticipate that the Craniobot could be easily adapted for use in other small animals.","Rynes, Mathew L; Ghanbari, Leila; Schulman, Daniel Sousa; Linn, Samantha; Laroque, Michael; Dominguez, Judith; Navabi, Zahra S; Sherman, Peter; Kodandaramaiah, Suhasa B",Nature protocols,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-020-0318-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32405052/,269

It is reported that at least 7000 health care workers (HCW) had lost their lives due to COVID-19 from the beginning of the pandemia till September 2020 in the world. In our country between the dates, March 11, 2020 which the first case was reported, and September 1, 2020, the date which our study has been finalized, 7428 HCW were infected by SARS-CoV-2, and 52 of them were deceased. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the contact and illness of healthcare workers working outside of the pandemic clinics in our hospital and to examine the possible transmission routes and disease prognoses. Healthcare workers who were working outside the pandemic service between March 11, 2020 and September 1, 2020 and who had a definite diagnosis of COVID-19 and all hospital staff who had contacted with these people, and HCW who had contact with patients diagnosed with COVID-19 while receiving inpatient treatment in services other than the pandemic service was evaluated and classified as low, medium and high risk according to the risk scoring defined in the published ""Ministry of Health COVID-19 Guidelines"". Healthcare workers who were evaluated as contacted were questioned in detail regarding the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) at the time of contact, especially suitability of the masks, contact time and shape and all the data were recorded. A total of 53 index cases (40 HCW and 13 inpatients diagnosed as COVID-19) were detected during the study period. The number of HCW contacted with these index cases was 672. In our study, we examined the data of 40 index cases and 672 contacted HCW (total of 712 HCW). Only 3 of 40 index cases (7.5%) had hospital-acquired COVID-19 infection, the other 37 cases were infected by community sources. COVID-19 was not detected in 94.2% of the contacted HCW during the follow-up while 5.8% of them had positive PCR test results. Considering the possible way of contamination among the contacted HCW who developed COVID-19 during the follow-up period, it was determined that 13.1% of the cases were a result of taken care of patients, 86.9% of the cases were a result of being in hospital social environments (drinking tea, smoking, eating, chatting in the same room without personal precautions) and in the days after the contact, it was in the form of contact with healthcare personnel diagnosed with COVID-19. When the contacted HCW were questioned about using proper masks at the time of contact, we determined that 93.3% of them used masks during patient caring procedures, however, only 48.9% used masks when they were in social areas (p<0.001). Healthcare workers face an unprecedented risk of occupational disease and death due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is also observed that prolonged pandemia period caused health workers to disregard rigorous infection control precautions in social areas of hospitals which they follow inpatient care although this has shown to be the most common way of contamination. Commonly performed in-service training and causing awareness in all areas of the hospital about following infection control precautions and PPE usage and checking the process regularly are the most important ways to prevent HCW from being affected by COVID-19.","Korkmaz, Derya; Konya, Petek; Tünay, Havva; Demirtürk, Neşe",Mikrobiyoloji bulteni,https://doi.org/10.5578/mb.20219906; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33882651/,269

To identify body mass index (BMI) trajectories in Chinese children and to compare the risk of incident high blood pressure (HBP) across trajectory groups.Methods. A total of 9286 children were included. The mean age at baseline was 8.9 years; age at endpoint ranged between 16 and 18 years. At least 8 measurements were obtained from each involved child. We used group-based trajectory modeling to identify BMI trajectory groups in each sex. We used blood pressure from each measurement to define HBP.Results. We identified 4 BMI trajectories for each sex. Compared with the low trajectory group, the hazard ratios of HBP in the higher trajectory groups ranged from 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11, 1.23) to 2.00 (95% CI = 1.78, 2.27) during follow-up, and HBP risk at late adolescence ranged from 1.36 (95% CI = 1.22, 1.52) to 3.63 (95% CI = 3.12, 4.21). All trend P values across trajectories were less than .001. In terms of population level, overweight started 3 years earlier than HBP.Conclusions. Children of higher BMI trajectories had a higher risk of HBP during adolescence. The transition period from overweight to HBP onset could be critical for HBP prevention. (Am J Public Health.

Although culture, education and sociological factors have been implicated in their development, psychological factors are recognized as important. Certain individual differences, including schizotypy and cognitive processing style, have been shown to make some individuals susceptible to CTs. However, the finding that schizotypy often co-occurs with autism spectrum disorder raises a question as to the relative and potentially confounding role of autistic traits in increasing vulnerability to CT beliefs. METHOD A total of 508 adults were recruited from an international online panel. The study included measures of conspiracy beliefs, schizotypy and autistic traits as well as measures of information searching and cognitive style. RESULTS The results confirmed that both autistic and schizotypy traits were positively associated with CT beliefs, but that schizotypy traits were the strongest predictor. Exploratory analyses of cognitive style measures indicated potential avenues for further investigation in relation in differences in cognitive processes that might underlie the development of CTs for in people with autistic traits as opposed to schizotypal traits. LIMITATIONS The study was based on a self-report methodology and did not utilise a clinical sample. CONCLUSION Both schizotypal and autistic traits are reliable predictors of conspiracy beliefs, but schizotypy appears to be the stronger predictor and that autistic traits are not a strong confounding factor in this relationship. However, autistic traits may pose an additional risk factor for CT beliefs.","Georgiou, Neophytos; Delfabbro, Paul; Balzan, Ryan",Cognitive neuropsychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1080/13546805.2021.1924650; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33970807/,269

These patients are at increased risk for fatal post-surgical complications from pulmonary hypoventilation. We present a case with myotonic dystrophy and esophageal cancer who had a minimally invasive esophagectomy complicated with gastrobronchial fistulisation. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 44-year-old male with myotonic dystrophy type 1 and esophageal cancer had a minimally invasive esophagectomy performed instead of open surgery in order to reduce the risk for pulmonary complications. At day 15 respiratory failure occurred from a gastrobronchial fistula between the right intermediary bronchus (defect 7-8mm) and the esophagogastric anastomosis (defect 10mm). In order to minimize large leakage of air into the gastric conduit the anastomosis was stented and ventilation maintained at low airway pressures. His general condition improved and allowed extubation at day 29 and stent removal at day 35. Bronchoscopy confirmed that the fistula was healed. The patient was discharged from hospital at day 37 without further complications. DISCUSSION The fistula was probably caused by bronchial necrosis from thermal injury during close dissection using the Ligasure instrument. Fistula treatment by non-surgical intervention was considered safer than surgery which could be followed by potentially life-threatening respiratory complications. Indications for stenting of gastrobronchial fistulas will be discussed. CONCLUSIONS Minimally invasive esophagectomy was performed instead of open surgery in a myotonic dystrophy patient as these patients are particularly vulnerable to respiratory complications. Gastrobronchial fistula, a major complication, was safely treated by stenting and low airway pressure ventilation.","Hugin, Silje; Johnson, Egil; Johannessen, Hans-Olaf; Hofstad, Bjørn; Olafsen, Kjell; Mellem, Harald",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2015.10.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26520033/,269

METHODS Eighteen fetuses underwent surgical creation of a MMC defect at day 75. Fetuses were then randomized into 3 groups. Four fetuses remained untreated (control group). In the other 14 fetuses, a prenatal repair was performed at day 90: 7 fetuses had an open repair (oMMC), and 7 fetuses had a fetoscopic repair (fMMC) using a single-layer running suture through a 2-port access. Lambs were sacrificed at term, and histological examinations were performed. RESULTS Hindbrain herniation was observed in all live lambs in the control group. A complete closure of the defect was achieved in all the lambs of the fMMC group. A complete healing of the defect and no hindbrain herniation were observed in all live lambs of the oMMC and fMMC groups. The durations of surgeries were not statistically different between the oMMC and the fMMC groups (60 vs. 53 min, p = 0.40), as was the risk of fetal loss (fMMC: 1/7, oMMC: 3/7, p = 0.56).

82252,New approach to improving insulin sensitivity.,2021-02-01,"Background Fat grafting is commonly used when treating soft-tissue defects. However, much of the basic biology behind fat transfer is still uncovered. Adipocytes can be divided into energy storing white and energy burning brown adipose cells. It is now well known, that also adult humans have metabolically active brown adipose tissue (BAT) within white adipose tissue (WAT). Previously our group showed that transfer of metabolically inactive WAT into a new environment increased the metabolic activity of the fat grafts to resemble the activity in the recipient site and that different WAT depots have variation in the metabolic activity. This led us to speculate, whether the metabolic increase of the graft is a result of ""browning"" of the transferred WAT toward beige adipose tissue. Methods We investigated the metabolic and histological characteristics and BAT marker Ucp1 gene expression in different types of WAT grafts placed either in subcutaneous or muscle tissue in mice. Metabolic activity of the grafts was investigated by FDG-PET/CT at 4- and 12-week time-points. Results The glucose uptake of all transferred fat types was increased when compared with respective control WAT regardless of transfer location. Ucp1 gene and protein expression was increased in 4 of 15 intramuscularly placed fat graft samples and showed histological resemblance to BAT with multilocular cells. Conclusions Grafting of metabolically inactive fat intramuscularly may induce browning of fat grafts toward more active beige adipose tissue. This opens up new research areas in exploiting fat grafting in metabolic diseases.","Hoppela, Erika; Grönroos, Tove J; Saarikko, Anne M; Tervala, Tomi V; Kauhanen, Susanna; Nuutila, Pirjo; Kivinen, Katri; Hartiala, Pauliina",Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

METHODS A retrospective review of outcomes among women diagnosed with VaIN after vaginal punch biopsy conducted due to an abnormal Papanicolaou smear or positive test for hrHPV at a hospital in Seoul, Korea, from 2013 to 2018. Logistic regression was used to identify variables associated with abnormal pathologic outcomes. RESULTS Among 389 women included in the study, 58 were diagnosed with high-grade VaIN, including VaIN stage 2 (n = 37), VaIN stage 3 (n = 16), carcinoma in situ of the vagina (n = 3), and squamous carcinoma of the vagina (n = 2). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, risk of high-grade VaIN and cancer was higher among women with abnormal cytology (odds ratio [OR], 1.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.47-2.47), any hrHPV infection (OR, 8.75; 95% CI, 1.14-67.31), HPV16 infection (OR, 5.71; 95% CI, 2.57-12.68), or HPV31 infection (OR, 4.37; 95% CI, 1.45-13.11). CONCLUSION The findings suggest that infection with hrHPV, especially HPV16 and HPV31, is significantly associated with high-grade VaIN. Regarding treatment modalities, ablative or excisional treatments showed good efficacy against pathologic regression of high-grade VaIN.","Cho, Hyun-Woong; Hong, Jin-Hwa; Lee, Jae Kwan",International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,https://doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.13583; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411347/,269
83084,A new beginning.,2020-08-12,"BACKGROUND Recent occurrence of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has highlighted the need for fast, accurate, and simple strategies to identify cases on a large scale. OBJECTIVE This study aims to develop and test an accurate detection and severity classification methodology that may help medical professionals and non-radiologists recognize the behavior and propagation mechanisms of the virus by viewing computed tomography (CT) images of the lungs with implicit materials. METHODS In this study, the process of detecting the virus began with the deployment of a virtual material inside CT images of the lungs of 128 patients. Virtual material is a hypothetical material that can penetrate the healthy regions in the image by performing sequential numerical measurements to interpret images with high data accuracy. The proposed method also provides a segmented image of only the healthy parts of the lung. RESULTS The resulting segmented images, which represent healthy parts of the lung, are classified into six levels of severity. These levels are classified according to physical symptoms. The results of the proposed methodology are compared with those of the radiologists' reports. This comparison revealed that the gold-standard reports correlated with the results of the proposed methodology with a high accuracy rate of 93%. CONCLUSION The study results indicate the possibility of relying on the proposed methodology for discovering the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the lungs through CT imaging analysis with limited dependency on radiologists.","Abbas, M A; Alqahtani, M S; Alkulib, A J; Almohiy, H M; Alshehri, R F; Alamri, E A; Alamri, A A",Journal of X-ray science and technology,https://doi.org/10.3233/xst-200794; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33579889/,269

It is an established minimally invasive technique, although its indications in the field of Urology are currently under development. MATERIAL AND METHODS We present the first case of incision-less pyelolithectomy, performed through a single-port placed in the umbilicus, performed in a 47 years-old male patient (38.2 BMI) with solitary 4 cm diameter lithiasis in a horseshoe kidney. An umbilical 2.5 cm incision was used for the introduction of a prototype of the reusable Richard Wolf single-port system, without any ancillary elements. RESULTS After placement of left double-J stent proximal left ureter and renal pelvis, pyelolithectomy and pyelorraphy were performed with DuoRotate-Instruments© (Richard Wolf). Water-tightness was demostrated with methylene blue intravesical instillation and no drain was placed. The procedure lasted for 280 min and bleeding was 30 cc. The patient was discharged 24 hours later without pain. CONCLUSION Incision-less pyelolithectomy is a feasible and resolutive option to treat pelvic lithiasis. It can be considered the most beneficial option in aesthetical terms in experienced centers, especially in peculiar cases like horseshoe kidney.","Cabrera, P M; Cáceres, F; García-Tello, A; García-Mediero, J M; Arconada, J; Angulo, J C",Actas urologicas espanolas,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acuro.2011.10.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22130550/,269

84874,Measurement of electrical coupling between cardiac ablation catheters and tissue.,2014,"BACKGROUND Although the vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) is effective in achieving weight loss without metabolic side effects during the first few years, late failures cause weight regain in about 20% of the patients. The laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is the procedure of choice to convert a failed VBG. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between August 2014 and June 2016, 37 patients (23 females and 14 males) underwent revisional LRYGBs after failed VBGs. Thirty-four patients had open VBGs and two patients had laparoscopic butterfly gastroplasties. These patients completed follow-ups of at least 1 year. RESULTS The median operating time was 164 min (range 132-246), and the mean length of the hospital stay was 2.4 days (range 2-7). The mean body mass index (BMI) of the study group was 42.5 kg/m2, while the mean BMI and the percentage of excess body weight loss (%EBWL) for the patients 6 months after the operation were 31.7 kg/m2 and 52.1%, respectively. The mean BMI and %EBWL for the patients 1 year after the operation were 29.5 kg/m2 and 67.7%, respectively. There were neither intraoperative complications nor postoperative mortalities, but the overall complication rate was 22% (eight patients). CONCLUSION An LRYGB following a VBG is technically challenging, but safe, with low morbidity and mortality rates. Moreover, a revisional LRYGB provides excellent weight loss results.","Zakaria, Mahmoud; Elhoofy, Ahmad",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-018-3375-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30066246/,269
84978,Metformin enhances protection in guinea pigs chronically infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND Neoadjuvant therapy is integral in the treatment of locally advanced esophageal cancer. Despite increasing acceptance of minimally invasive approaches to esophagectomy, there remain concerns about the safety and oncologic soundness after neoadjuvant therapy. We examined outcomes in patients undergoing open and minimally invasive (MIE) Ivor Lewis esophagectomy after neoadjuvant therapy. METHODS This was a retrospective series of 130 consecutive patients with esophageal cancer undergoing Ivor Lewis esophagectomy with curative intention after neoadjuvant therapy at a tertiary academic center (2008 to 2012). RESULTS An open procedure was performed in 74 patients (56.9%), and 56 (43.1%) underwent MIE after neoadjuvant therapy. MIE patients had shorter median intensive care unit (p = 0.002) and hospital lengths of stay (p < 0.0001). The incidence of postoperative complications was similar (open: 54.8% vs MIE: 41.1%, p = 0.155). However, observed respiratory complications were significantly reduced after MIE (8.9%) compared with open (29.7%; p = 0.004). Anastomotic leak rates were similar (open: 1.4% vs. MIE: 0%, p = 1.00). Mortality at 30 and 90 days was comparable (open: 2.7% and 4.1% vs MIE: 0% and 1.8%, p = 0.506 and p = 0.634, respectively). Complete resection rates and the number of collected lymph nodes was similar. Overall survival rates at 5 years were similar (open: 61% vs MIE: 50%, p = 0.933). MIE was not a significant predictor of overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 0.61 to 1.87; p = 0.810). CONCLUSIONS MIE proves its safety after neoadjuvant therapy because it leads to faster progression during the early postoperative period while reducing pulmonary complications. Open and MIE approaches appear equivalent with regards to perioperative oncologic outcomes after neoadjuvant therapy. Long-term outcomes need further validation.","Tapias, Luis F; Mathisen, Douglas J; Wright, Cameron D; Wain, John C; Gaissert, Henning A; Muniappan, Ashok; Lanuti, Michael; Donahue, Dean M; Morse, Christopher R",The Annals of thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2015.09.062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26652140/,269
87318,"Technological innovation, financialization, and ecological footprint: evidence from BEM economies.",2021-01-07,"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic. Few studies have explored the role of chest computed tomography (CT) features and severity scores for prognostic prediction. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of chest CT severity score and imaging features in the prediction of the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Methods A total of 134 patients (62 recovered and 72 deceased patients) with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled. The clinical, laboratory, and chest CT (316 scans) data were retrospectively reviewed. Demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, and temporal changes of laboratory results, CT features, and severity scores were compared between recovered and deceased groups using the Mann-Whitney U test and logistic regression to identify the risk factors for poor prognosis. Results Median age was 48 and 58 years for recovered and deceased patients, respectively. More patients had at least one comorbidity in the deceased group than the recovered group (60% vs. 29%). Leukocytes, neutrophil, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), prothrombin, D-dimer, serum ferritin, interleukin (IL)-2, and IL-6 were significantly elevated in the deceased group than the recovered group at different stages. The total CT score at the peak stage was significantly greater in the deceased group than the recovered group (20 vs. 11 points). The optimal cutoff value of the total CT scores was 16.5 points, achieving 69.4% sensitivity and 82.2% specificity for the prognostic prediction. The crazy-paving pattern and consolidation were more common in the deceased patients than those in the recovered patients. Linear opacities significantly increased with the disease course in the recovered patients. Sex, age, neutrophil, IL-2, IL-6, and total CT scores were independent risk factors for the prognosis with odds ratios of 3.8 to 8.7. Conclusions Sex (male), older age (>60 years), elevated neutrophil, IL-2, IL-6 level, and total CT scores (≥16) were independent risk factors for poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Temporal changes of chest CT features and severity scores could be valuable for early identification of severe cases and eventually reducing the mortality rate of COVID-19.","Zhou, Shuchang; Chen, Chengyang; Hu, Yiqi; Lv, Wenzhi; Ai, Tao; Xia, Liming",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-3421; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33313194/,269

89196,An Efficient Method for Coronavirus Detection Through X-rays using deep Neural Network.,2021-01-12,"OBJECTIVE To determine how neurology departments and residency programs in the United States used virtual communication to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic, we investigated the presence and use of social media pages, virtual outreach events, and virtual internship opportunities. METHODS Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook accounts were identified (or noted as nonexistent) for 159 accredited neurology departments and residency programs. Google searches and social media site specific searches were performed. For existing pages, the date of creation was determined and all posts on and after March 1st, 2020, were assessed to investigate the presence of virtual open house advertisements. Each program was also assessed for virtual sub-internship and elective opportunities on the Visiting Student Application Service (VSAS). RESULTS A majority of neurology residency programs (110) had a social media presence, particularly on Twitter and Instagram. Most residency program Twitter and Instagram accounts were created after March 1st, 2020, and this was not the case on Facebook. Twitter and Instagram were used most to advertise virtual opportunities. A correlation was observed between presence and number of social media accounts and program prestige. Few programs offered virtual opportunities on VSAS for the 2020-2021 year. CONCLUSION Neurology residency programs adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic by creating residency social media accounts, primarily on Instagram and Twitter, and hosting virtual informational events. We recommend that neurology residency applicants create professional Instagram and Twitter accounts to network with programs and receive updates about virtual events. Similarly, going forward, we recommend continued social media use by neurology residency programs for applicant outreach.","Gaini, Rahul R; Patel, Kush M; Khan, Saad A; Singh, Nikhi P; Love, Marissa Natelson",Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clineuro.2021.106717; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34091422/,269

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib for induction and maintenance treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease (CD). DESIGN We conducted two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre phase IIb studies. Adult patients with moderate-to-severe CD were randomised to receive induction treatment with placebo, tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg twice daily for 8 weeks. Those achieving clinical response-100 or remission were re-randomised to maintenance treatment with placebo, tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg twice daily for 26 weeks. Primary endpoints were clinical remission at the end of the induction study, and clinical response-100 or remission at the end of the maintenance study. RESULTS 180/280 patients randomised in the induction study were enrolled in the maintenance study. At week 8 of induction, the proportion of patients with clinical remission was 43.5% and 43.0% with 5 and 10 mg twice daily, respectively, compared with 36.7% in the placebo group (p=0.325 and 0.392 for 5 and 10 mg twice daily vs placebo). At week 26 of maintenance, the proportion of patients with clinical response-100 or remission was 55.8% with tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily compared with 39.5% with tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily and 38.1% with placebo (p=0.130 for 10 mg twice daily vs placebo). Compared with placebo, the change in C-reactive protein from baseline was statistically significant (p<0.0001) with 10 mg twice daily after both induction and maintenance treatments.

OBJECTIVE To effectively triage COVID-19 patients within situations of limited data availability and to explore optimal thresholds to minimize mortality rates while maintaining healthcare system capacity. METHODS A nationwide sample of 5,601 patients confirmed for COVID-19 up until April 2020 was retrospectively reviewed. XGBoost and logistic regression analysis were used to develop prediction models for the maximum clinical severity during hospitalization, classified according to the WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (OSCI). The recursive feature elimination technique was used to evaluate maintenance of the model performance when clinical and laboratory variables were eliminated. Using populations based on hypothetical patient influx scenarios, discrete-event simulation was performed to find an optimal threshold within limited resource environments that minimizes mortality rates. RESULTS The cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) of the baseline XGBoost model that utilized all 37 variables was 0.965 for OSCI ≥ 6. Compared to the baseline model's performance, the AUROC of the feature-eliminated model that utilized 17 variables was maintained at 0.963 with statistical insignificance. Optimal thresholds were found to minimize mortality rates in a hypothetical patient influx scenario. The benefit of utilizing an optimal triage threshold was clear, reducing mortality up to 18.1%, compared to the conventional Youden Index. CONCLUSIONS Our adaptive triage model and its threshold optimization capability revealed that COVID-19 management can be achieved via the cooperation of both medical and healthcare management sectors for maximum treatment efficacy. The model is available online for clinical implementation.

However, the in vivo role of specific antiviral genes that are induced by IFN-I against WNV infection remains less well characterized. Here, using Ifit2(-/-) mice, we defined the antiviral function of the interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) Ifit2 in limiting infection and disease in vivo by a virulent North American strain of WNV. Compared to congenic wild-type controls, Ifit2(-/-) mice showed enhanced WNV infection in a tissue-restricted manner, with preferential replication in the CNS of animals lacking Ifit2. Virological analysis of cultured macrophages, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, cerebellar granule cell neurons, and cortical neurons revealed cell type-specific antiviral functions of Ifit2 against WNV. In comparison, small effects of Ifit2 were observed on the induction or magnitude of innate or adaptive immune responses. Our results suggest that Ifit2 restricts WNV infection and pathogenesis in different tissues in a cell type-specific manner.","Cho, Hyelim; Shrestha, Bimmi; Sen, Ganes C; Diamond, Michael S",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01097-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23740986/,269

Whereas β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) blockers are routinely used for the management of MI, they may also counter β-AR-mediated vasodilation of coronary vessels. We have reported that ghrelin prevents sympathetic activation following MI. Whether ghrelin modulates coronary vascular tone following MI, either through the modulation of SNA or directly as a vasoactive mediator, has never been addressed. We used synchrotron microangiography to image coronary perfusion and vessel internal diameter (ID) in anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats, before and then again 30 minutes after induction of an MI (left coronary artery ligation). Rats were injected with either saline or ghrelin (150 µg/kg, subcutaneously), immediately following the MI or sham surgery. Coronary angiograms were also recorded following β-AR blockade (propranolol, 2 mg/kg, intravenously). Finally, wire myography was used to assess the effect of ghrelin on vascular tone in isolated human internal mammary arteries (IMAs). Acute MI enhanced coronary perfusion to nonischemicregions through dilation of small arterioles (ID 50 to 250 µm) and microvessel recruitment, irrespective of ghrelin treatment. In ghrelin-treated rats, β-AR blockade did not alter the ischemia-induced vasodilation, yet in saline-treated rats, β-AR blockade abolished the vasodilation of small arterioles. Finally, ghrelin caused a dose-dependent vasodilation of IMA rings (preconstricted with phenylephrine). In summary, this study highlights ghrelin as a promising adjunct therapy that can be used in combination with routine β-AR blockade treatment for preserving coronary blood flow and cardiac performance in patients who suffer an acute MI.","Pearson, James T; Collie, Nicola; Lamberts, Regis R; Inagaki, Tadakatsu; Yoshimoto, Misa; Umetani, Keiji; Davis, Philip; Wilkins, Gerard; Jones, Pete P; Shirai, Mikiyasu; Schwenke, Daryl O",Endocrinology,https://doi.org/10.1210/en.2017-03070; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29325034/,269

99335,[Radiological practice-Terra incognita].,2021-06-16,"BACKGROUND Chest X-rays are the most commonly available and affordable radiological examination for screening thoracic diseases. According to the domain knowledge of screening chest X-rays, the pathological information usually lay on the lung and heart regions. However, it is costly to acquire region-level annotation in practice, and model training mainly relies on image-level class labels in a weakly supervised manner, which is highly challenging for computer-aided chest X-ray screening. To address this issue, some methods have been proposed recently to identify local regions containing pathological information, which is vital for thoracic disease classification. Inspired by this, we propose a novel deep learning framework to explore discriminative information from lung and heart regions. RESULT We design a feature extractor equipped with a multi-scale attention module to learn global attention maps from global images. To exploit disease-specific cues effectively, we locate lung and heart regions containing pathological information by a well-trained pixel-wise segmentation model to generate binarization masks. By introducing element-wise logical AND operator on the learned global attention maps and the binarization masks, we obtain local attention maps in which pixels are are 1 for lung and heart region and 0 for other regions. By zeroing features of non-lung and heart regions in attention maps, we can effectively exploit their disease-specific cues in lung and heart regions. Compared to existing methods fusing global and local features, we adopt feature weighting to avoid weakening visual cues unique to lung and heart regions. Our method with pixel-wise segmentation can help overcome the deviation of locating local regions. Evaluated by the benchmark split on the publicly available chest X-ray14 dataset, the comprehensive experiments show that our method achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods. CONCLUSION We propose a novel deep framework for the multi-label classification of thoracic diseases in chest X-ray images. The proposed network aims to effectively exploit pathological regions containing the main cues for chest X-ray screening. Our proposed network has been used in clinic screening to assist the radiologists. Chest X-ray accounts for a significant proportion of radiological examinations. It is valuable to explore more methods for improving performance.","Fang, Jiansheng; Xu, Yanwu; Zhao, Yitian; Yan, Yuguang; Liu, Junling; Liu, Jiang",BMC medical imaging,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12880-021-00627-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34112095/,269

Thus, we conducted a survey in EBMT transplant centers focusing on pre- and post-allo-HCT MRD. One hundred and six centers from 29 countries responded. One hundred had a formal strategy for routine MRD assessment, 91 for both ALL and AML. For ALL (n = 95), assessing MRD has been routine practice starting from 2010 (range, 1990-2019). Techniques used for MRD assessment consisted of PCR techniques alone (n = 27), multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC, n = 16), both techniques (n = 43), next-generation sequencing (NGS) + PCR (n = 2), or PCR + MFC + NGS (n = 7). The majority of centers assessed MRD every 2-3 months for 2 (range, 1-until relapse) years. For AML, assessing MRD was routine in 92 centers starting in 2010 (range 1990-2019). Assessment of MRD was by PCR (n = 23), MFC (n = 13), both PCR and MFC (n = 39), both PCR and NGS (n = 3), and by all three techniques (n = 14). The majority assesses MRD for AML every 2-3 months for 2 (range, 1-until relapse) years. This survey is the first step in the aim to include MRD status as a routine registry capture parameter in acute leukemia.","Nagler, Arnon; Baron, Frédéric; Labopin, Myriam; Polge, Emmanuel; Esteve, Jordi; Bazarbachi, Ali; Brissot, Eolia; Bug, Gesine; Ciceri, Fabio; Giebel, Sebastian; Gilleece, Maria H; Gorin, Norbert-Claude; Lanza, Francesco; Peric, Zinaida; Ruggeri, Annalisa; Sanz, Jaime; Savani, Bipin N; Schmid, Christoph; Shouval, Roni; Spyridonidis, Alexandros; Versluis, Jurjen; Mohty, Mohamad",Bone marrow transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41409-020-01005-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724200/,269

They can be both pro- and anti-inflammatory and function as important mediators in various pathological conditions. However, comprehensive analysis of oxylipins still remains a challenge because of their low abundance in plasma and the dominance of structurally similar isomeric species. Herein, we describe a simple and rapid method to comprehensively analyze oxylipins in blood plasma, which utilizes solid-phase extraction in 96-well format for efficient sample cleanup. Separation and detection of more than 130 oxylipins is accomplished by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with multiple reaction monitoring in negative-ion mode. The absolute concentrations of oxylipins in human plasma are determined using the calibration curves constructed from internal standards. Detailed methods and precautions are presented for a successful adoption of this method in analytical laboratory.","Chen, Guan-Yuan; Zhang, Qibin",Methods in molecular biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-1410-5_12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33954947/,269

The angular arrangement of M, S and R atoms with ∠(R-S...M) down to 150° was a common feature of the late transition metal complexes exhibiting shortened R-S...M contacts. Several model nickel(II), palladium(II), platinum(II) and gold(I) complexes were chosen for a theoretical analysis of R-S...M interactions using the DFT method applied to (equilibrium) isolated systems. A combination of the real-space approaches, such as Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM), noncovalent interaction index (NCI), electron localization function (ELF) and Interacting Quantum Atoms (IQA), and orbital (Natural Bond Orbitals, NBO) methods was used to provide insights into the nature and energetics of R-S...M interactions with respect to the metal atom identity and its coordination environment. The explored features of the R-S...M interactions support the trends observed by inspecting the CSD statistics, and indicate a predominant contribution of semicoordination bonds between nucleophilic sites of the sulfur atom and electrophilic sites of the metal. A contribution of chalcogen bonding (that is formally opposite to semicoordination) was also recognized, although it was significantly smaller in magnitude. The analysis of R-S...M interaction strengths was performed and the structure-directing role of the intramolecular R-S...M interactions in stabilizing certain conformations of metal complexes was revealed.","Ananyev, Ivan V; Bokach, Nadezhda A; Kukushkin, Vadim Yu","Acta crystallographica Section B, Structural science, crystal engineering and materials",https://doi.org/10.1107/s2052520620005685; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831262/,269

We aimed to assess the associations of physical activity with the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). MATERIAL AND METHODS We analysed data on 2,394 apparently healthy men with good baseline cognitive function from the prospective population-based Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease study. We assessed habits of physical activity at baseline using a 12-month leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) questionnaire. Using Cox regression, we calculated hazard ratios adjusted for body-mass index, systolic blood pressure, smoking status, history of type-2 diabetes, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, alcohol consumption, history of coronary heart disease, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. RESULTS During a median follow-up of 24.9 years (interquartile range: 18.3-26.9), 208 men developed dementia and 128 developed AD. Multivariable adjusted hazard ratios for dementia comparing top vs. bottom tertiles of physical activity were 0.97 (95% confidence intervals: 0.69-1.38) for total physical activity volume, 0.96 (0.69-1.34) for conditioning LTPA volume, and 1.13 (0.80-1.61) for total LTPA volume. Corresponding hazard ratios for AD were 1.19 (0.76-1.85), 0.98 (0.64-1.49), and 1.22 (0.77-1.93). Associations were consistent in analyses restricted to participants with ≥10 years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS In middle-aged Caucasian men, various physical activity exposures were not associated with all-cause dementia or AD. Future studies should address biases due to reverse causation and regression dilution and should involve objective measures of physical activity.","Kunutsor, Setor K; Laukkanen, Jari A; Kauhanen, Jussi; Willeit, Peter",European journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1111/eci.13415; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991743/,269

101759,Ciliary dyskinesia is an early feature of respiratory syncytial virus infection.,2014,"Vestibular dysfunction, causing dizziness and imbalance, is a common yet poorly understood feature in patients with TBI. Damage to the inner ear, nerve, brainstem, cerebellum and cerebral hemispheres may all affect vestibular functioning, hence, a multi-level assessment-from reflex to perception-is required. In a previous report, postural instability was the commonest neurological feature in ambulating acute patients with TBI. During ward assessment, we also frequently observe a loss of vertigo sensation in patients with acute TBI, common inner ear conditions and a related vigorous vestibular-ocular reflex nystagmus, suggesting a 'vestibular agnosia'. Patients with vestibular agnosia were also more unbalanced; however, the link between vestibular agnosia and imbalance was confounded by the presence of inner ear conditions. We investigated the brain mechanisms of imbalance in acute TBI, its link with vestibular agnosia, and potential clinical impact, by prospective laboratory assessment of vestibular function, from reflex to perception, in patients with preserved peripheral vestibular function. Assessment included: vestibular reflex function, vestibular perception by participants' report of their passive yaw rotations in the dark, objective balance via posturography, subjective symptoms via questionnaires, and structural neuroimaging. We prospectively screened 918 acute admissions, assessed 146 and recruited 37. Compared to 37 matched controls, patients showed elevated vestibular-perceptual thresholds (patients 12.92°/s versus 3.87°/s) but normal vestibular-ocular reflex thresholds (patients 2.52°/s versus 1.78°/s). Patients with elevated vestibular-perceptual thresholds [3 standard deviations (SD) above controls' average], were designated as having vestibular agnosia, and displayed worse posturography than non-vestibular-agnosia patients, despite no difference in vestibular symptom scores. Only in patients with impaired postural control (3 SD above controls' mean), whole brain diffusion tensor voxel-wise analysis showed elevated mean diffusivity (and trend lower fractional anisotropy) in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus in the right temporal lobe that correlated with vestibular agnosia severity. Thus, impaired balance and vestibular agnosia are co-localized to the inferior longitudinal fasciculus in the right temporal lobe. Finally, a clinical audit showed a sevenfold reduction in clinician recognition of a common peripheral vestibular condition (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo) in acute patients with clinically apparent vestibular agnosia. That vestibular agnosia patients show worse balance, but without increased dizziness symptoms, explains why clinicians may miss treatable vestibular diagnoses in these patients. In conclusion, vestibular agnosia mediates imbalance in traumatic brain injury both directly via white matter tract damage in the right temporal lobe, and indirectly via reduced clinical recognition of common, treatable vestibular diagnoses.","Calzolari, Elena; Chepisheva, Mariya; Smith, Rebecca M; Mahmud, Mohammad; Hellyer, Peter J; Tahtis, Vassilios; Arshad, Qadeer; Jolly, Amy; Wilson, Mark; Rust, Heiko; Sharp, David J; Seemungal, Barry M",Brain : a journal of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awaa386; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33367536/,269

However, the imbalance between the supply and the demand for human organs is a serious problem in modern transplantology. One of many solutions to overcome this problem is the use of xenotransplantation. The domestic pig (Sus scrofa domestica) is currently considered as the most suitable for human organ procurement. However, there are discrepancies between pigs and humans that lead to the creation of immunological barriers preventing the direct xenograft. The introduction of appropriate modifications to the pig genome to prevent xenograft rejection is crucial in xenotransplantation studies. In this study, porcine GGTA1, CMAH, β4GalNT2, vWF, ASGR1 genes were selected to introduce genetic modifications. The evaluation of three selected gRNAs within each gene was obtained, which enabled the selection of the best site for efficient introduction of changes. Modifications were examined after nucleofection of porcine primary kidney fibroblasts with CRISPR/Cas9 system genetic constructs, followed by the tracking of indels by decomposition (TIDE) analysis. In addition, off-target analysis was carried out for selected best gRNAs using the TIDE tool, which is new in the research conducted so far and shows the utility of this tool in these studies.","Ryczek, Natalia; Hryhorowicz, Magdalena; Lipiński, Daniel; Zeyland, Joanna; Słomski, Ryszard",Genes,https://doi.org/10.3390/genes11060713; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32604937/,269

104825,"Response to Elmaraghi et al. re: ""Maxillofacial Trauma Management During COVID-19: Multidisciplinary Recommendations"".",2020-06-11,"BACKGROUND Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the second most common infection presenting in the community. Clinical guidelines and decision aids assist health practitioners to treat a UTI; however, treatment practices vary due to patient needs and context of presentation. Numerous trials have evaluated the effectiveness of treatment interventions for UTI; however, it is difficult to compare the results between trials due to inconsistencies between reported outcomes. Poor choice of outcome measures can lead to impairment of evidence synthesis due to the inability to compare outcomes between trials with similar aims. Transparency in selecting and reporting outcomes can be mitigated through the development of an agreed minimum set of outcomes that should be reported in clinical trials, referred to as a core outcome set (COS). This paper presents the protocol for the development of a COS for interventions in the treatment of uncomplicated UTI in adults. METHODS This COS development consists of three phases. Phase 1 is a systematic review, which aims to identify the core outcomes that have been reported in trials and systematic reviews of interventions treating uncomplicated UTI in adults. Phase 2 consists of a three-round online Delphi survey with stakeholders in the area of treatment interventions for UTI. The aim of this online Delphi survey is to achieve consensus on the importance of the outcomes emerging from Phase 1 of this research. Phase 3 is a consensus meeting to finalise the COS that should be reported in trials evaluating the effectiveness of interventions for the treatment of UTI. DISCUSSION It is hoped that the development of a COS for interventions for the treatment of uncomplicated UTI in adults will be adopted as a minimum set of outcomes that should be reported and measured within this context. If the findings from clinical trials related to treatment interventions for UTI are to impact on policy and practice, it is important that the findings from different treatment interventions are comparable across trials.","Duane, Sinead; Vellinga, Akke; Murphy, Andrew W; Cormican, Martin; Smyth, Andrew; Healy, Patricia; Moore, Michael; Little, Paul; Devane, Declan",Trials,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13063-019-3194-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30732617/,269

METHODS Quantitative EEG parameters delta/alpha ratio (DAR), brain symmetry index (BSI) and directional BSI (BSIdir) were derived from 62-channel resting-state EEG recordings in 39 adults within three weeks after a first-ever ischemic hemispheric stroke. FM-UE scores were acquired within three weeks (FM-UEbaseline) and at 26 weeks poststroke (FM-UEw26). Linear regression analyses were performed using a forward selection procedure to predict FM-UEw26. RESULTS BSI calculated over the theta band (BSItheta) (β = -0.40; p = 0.013) was the strongest EEG-based predictor regarding FM-UEw26. BSItheta (β = -0.27; p = 0.006) remained a significant predictor when added to a regression model including FM-UEbaseline, increasing explained variance from 61.5% to 68.1%. CONCLUSION Higher BSItheta values, reflecting more power asymmetry over the hemispheres, predict more upper limb motor impairment six months after stroke. Moreover, BSItheta shows additive prognostic value regarding FM-UEw26 next to FM-UEbaseline scores, and thereby contains unique information regarding upper extremity motor recovery. SIGNIFICANCE To our knowledge, we are the first to show that resting-state EEG parameters can serve as prognostic biomarkers of stroke recovery, in addition to FM-UEbaseline scores.","Saes, Mique; Meskers, Carel G M; Daffertshofer, Andreas; van Wegen, Erwin E H; Kwakkel, Gert",Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinph.2020.09.031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33248434/,269

This study evaluates the construct, content and face validity of an inexpensive, easily reproducible simulator for teaching thoracoscopic lobectomy. METHODS Construct validity (ability of the simulator to discriminate between users of different skill levels) was assessed by having surgical trainees perform a lobectomy on the simulator. Participants were divided into three groups (experienced, intermediate and novice) based on self-reported experience with minimally invasive surgery. After instruction and practice time to limit the effect of any simulator-specific learning curve, each performed a left upper lobectomy that was scored using a standardized assessment tool incorporating total time plus weighted penalty minutes assigned for errors. Content validity (simulator requires same steps and decision-making as a clinical lobectomy) was assessed using a Likert scale by those participants who had previously seen a thoracoscopic lobectomy in a patient. RESULTS Thirty-one residents participated in the study (12 experienced, 6 intermediate and 13 novice). All 12 experienced participants completed the lobectomy. The other groups were less successful with 4 of 6 in the intermediate group and 5 of 13 in the novice group completing the lobectomy (P = 0.004). The mean times for lobectomy + penalty minutes were 35 + 6.8 (experienced), 50 + 13 (intermediate) and 54 + 20 (novice). Differences between groups were statistically significant for experienced vs. novice (P < 0.001) and experienced vs. intermediate (P < 0.04). Content validity was assessed by the 18 participants who had previously seen a thoracoscopic lobectomy with a mean of 9.2 of 10 possible points. CONCLUSIONS The thoracoscopic lobectomy simulator used in this study demonstrates acceptable validity and can be a useful tool for teaching thoracoscopic lobectomy to trainees or experienced surgeons.","Tong, Betty C; Gustafson, Monica R; Balderson, Stafford S; D'Amico, Thomas A; Meyerson, Shari L",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/ejcts/ezs012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22315356/,269

We sought to determine the predictors and clinical impact of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) after endovascular therapy. METHODS Retrospective analysis of consecutive patients presenting to 13 high volume stroke centers with AIS due to proximal occlusion in the anterior circulation who underwent endovascular treatment within 8 h from symptom onset. Logistic regression was performed to determine the variables associated with ICH, hemorrhagic infarction (HI), and parenchymal hematomas (PHs), as well as 90 day poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale score ≥3) and mortality. RESULTS There were a total of 363 ICHs (overall rate 32.3%; HI=267, 24%; PH=96, 8.5%) among the 1122 study patients (mean age 67±15 years; median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 17 (IQR 13-20)). Independent predictors for HI included diabetes mellitus (OR 2.27, 95% CI (1.58 to 3.26), p<0.0001), preprocedure IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) (1.43 (1.03 to 2.08), p<0.037), Merci thrombectomy (1.47 (1.02 to 2.12), p<0.032), and longer time to puncture (1.001 (1.00 to 1.002), p<0.026). Patients with atrial fibrillation (1.61 (1.01 to 2.55), p<0.045) had a higher risk of PH while the use of IA tPA (0.57 (0.35 to 0.90), p<0.008) was associated with lower chances of PH. Both the presence of HI (2.23 (1.53 to 3.25), p<0.0001) and PH (6.24 (3.06 to 12.75), p<0.0001) were associated with poor functional outcomes; however, only PH was associated with higher mortality (3.53 (2.19 to 5.68), p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Greater understanding about the predictors and consequences of ICH post endovascular stroke therapy is essential to improve risk assessment, patient selection/clinical outcomes, and early prognostication. Our data suggest that patients with atrial fibrillation are particularly prone to severe ICH and question the 'benign' nature of HI suggested by earlier studies.","Nogueira, Raul G; Gupta, Rishi; Jovin, Tudor G; Levy, Elad I; Liebeskind, David S; Zaidat, Osama O; Rai, Ansaar; Hirsch, Joshua A; Hsu, Daniel P; Rymer, Marilyn M; Tayal, Ashis H; Lin, Ridwan; Natarajan, Sabareesh K; Nanda, Ashish; Tian, Melissa; Hao, Qing; Kalia, Junaid S; Chen, Michael; Abou-Chebl, Alex; Nguyen, Thanh N; Yoo, Albert J",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2013-010743; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24401478/,269

METHODS This was a prospective cohort study of 39 COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in an experienced ECMO center at a tertiary hospital during March/April 2020. Among the recruited participants, 10 (25.6%) required ECMO (ICU-ECMO group) and 29 (74.4%) did not have ECMO support (ICU group). Immunological parameters were assessed both at ICU admission and on a daily basis for 7 consecutive days. RESULTS The absolute lymphocyte count increased significantly in the ICU-ECMO group compared to the ICU group in which it remained relatively stable: β for the time variable was 127.1 [95% CI 68.9 - 185.3], p < 0.001 and for the interaction term -141.36 [-208.95 - -73.77], p < 0.001. On the other hand, globally, no significant differences were observed over time for the lymphocyte percentage, although it was higher in the ICU patients. Neutrophil counts were overall higher in the ICU-ECMO group (β -4,275.38 [-6,845.21 - 1,705.55], p = 0.001). In regard to neutrophil percentage, a significant decrease over time was reported (β -1.76 [-3.16 - -0.36], p = 0.014), namely in the ICU-ECMO group (β for the interaction 2.09 [0.45 - 3.73], p = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS Herein, we found ECMO support seems to provide a less aggressive immune response in COVID-19 patients with severe and refractory respiratory dysfunction.","Fragao-Marques, Mariana; Barroso, Isaac; Loureiro, Hugo; Duarte-Gamas, Luis; Pinheiro, Dolores; Guimarães, João T",Clinical laboratory,https://doi.org/10.7754/clin.lab.2020.200916; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33978378/,269
115312,Non-invasive Estimation of Localized Dynamic Luminal Pressure Change by Ultrasound Elastography in Arteries with Normal and Abnormal Geometries.,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Ruptured blister-like aneurysms (BLAs) are challenging lesions to treat, without any consensus on their management. Few studies have evaluated the safety and effectiveness of flow diverter stents (FDS) for this indication, with promising results. The goal was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a delayed (≥5 days) flow diversion strategy for the treatment of ruptured intracranial BLAs. MATERIAL AND METHODS A monocentric retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database of intracranial aneurysms was performed. Eight consecutive patients with 9 ruptured intracranial BLAs from November 2010 to June 2018 were included in the study. The BLA treatment with FDS was delayed from the rupture (minimum rupture to treatment delay = 5 days, mean = 16.9 ± 9.2 days). Procedure-related complications were systematically recorded. Rebleeding occurrences were systematically assessed. Long-term clinical and angiographic follow-ups were recorded. RESULTS No procedure-related death was recorded. Neither early nor late rebleeding was observed and one (12.5%) major procedure-related complication occurred (ischemic stroke). Most of the patients (5/8; 62.5%) had an mRS <2 at discharge. The immediate periprocedural control angiogram showed a complete exclusion of the aneurysm in one patient (12.5%) but at follow-up (mean delay = 19.8 months) all patients had a complete aneurysm occlusion. All patients had a long-term mRS <2. CONCLUSION This case series suggests that a delayed treatment (≥5 days after the hemorrhagic event) of ruptured BLAs with FDS is feasible, and may be safe and effective in terms of rebleeding prevention and long-term angiographic outcome.","Capocci, Romain; Shotar, Eimad; Di Maria, Federico; Rolla-Bigliani, Claudia; Al Raaisi, Amira; André, Arthur; Mahtout, Jugurtha; Boch, Anne-Laure; Degos, Vincent; Sourour, Nader; Clarençon, Frédéric",Clinical neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00062-019-00758-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30683969/,269
115812,Geometrical deployment for braided stent.,2016,"BACKGROUND Lymphedema is a common and debilitating complication following cancer treatment with surgical lymph node excision and radiotherapy. Currently there are no curative treatments for lymphedema. Animal models that intended to replicate the disease have been inadequate, making a troublesome transition from experimental therapeutic studies into the clinic. It is therefore imperative to establish an experimental animal model that can reliably replicate clinical lymphedema. METHODS To discover the optimal method of lymphedema induction, surgical lymph ablation and irradiation or silicone splint emplacement were combined in 8 experimental groups (n = 4). In total, 32 mice served in this study and were followed for 8 weeks after surgery. Outcomes included micro-computed tomography hind limb volumetry, lymphatic clearance measured with technetium Tc 99m (Tc) human serum albumin lymphoscintigraphy and lymph vessel ectasia quantified with LYVE-1 immunohistochemistry. RESULTS All trialed models but one resulted in only transient lymphedema or lasting lymphedema with adverse morbidity. Combined surgical lymph obstruction with 2 fractions of 10-Gy irradiation successfully induced lasting lymphedema without adverse events. Over the 8 weeks' follow-up, limb volumes were significantly increased at all time points (P < 0.001), lymph drainage was impaired (P < 0.001), and lymph vessels were ectatic (P < 0.001), when compared with the unoperated limbs. CONCLUSIONS The presented model of acquired lymphedema is a reduction and refinement of previous works and can transpose to future observational and interventional studies. In addition, it is shown how Tc-HSA lymphoscintigraphy can quantify lymphatic clearance, which can prove insightful in therapeutic studies aiming to enhance lymphatic drainage.","Jørgensen, Mads Gustaf; Toyserkani, Navid Mohammadpour; Hansen, Christian Rønn; Hvidsten, Svend; Baun, Christina; Hejbøl, Eva Kildall; Schrøder, Henrik Daa; Sørensen, Jens Ahm",Annals of plastic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sap.0000000000001537; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29994875/,269

The optimal post-remission therapy (PRT) is unclear for patients with NPM1mut-negCEBPAdm-negFLT3-ITDneg AML who achieved first complete response (CR1). This study aims to explore clinical and molecular factors that can help determine the prognosis of those patients and their choice of PRT. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 28 patients with NPM1mut-negCEBPAdm-negFLT3-ITDneg AML who received induction chemotherapy and achieved CR1. For PRT, 17 patients received post-remission chemotherapy (PR-CT) and 11 patients received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). RESULTS For patients with NPM1mut-negCEBPAdm-negFLT3-ITDneg AML, multivariate analysis indicated that allo-HSCT and negative minimal residual disease (MRDneg) before PRT were favorable prognostic factors of overall survival (OS) (allo-HSCT, P = 0.002; MRDneg, P = 0.018); whereas relapse was an adverse prognostic factor of OS (P = 0.003). Log-rank analysis showed that allo-HSCT significantly improved their OS and RFS compared with PR-CT (OS, P < 0.001; RFS, P = 001). Otherwise, allo-HSCT improved the OS and RFS of patients with NPM1mut-negCEBPAdm-negFLT3-ITDneg AML, whether they obtained MRDpos or MRDneg before PRT (OS: MRDneg, P = 0.036; MRDpos, P = 0.012; RFS: MRDneg, P = 0.047; MRDpos, P = 0.030). CONCLUSION For patients with NPM1mut-negCEBPAdm-negFLT3-ITDneg AML, MRDneg before PRT and allo-HSCT were favorable prognostic factors of OS. Whether they obtain MRDneg or not, allo-HSCT is the preferred PRT.","Zheng, Wen-Shuai; Hu, Ya-Lei; Guan, Li-Xun; Peng, Bo; Wang, Shen-Yu",Hematology,https://doi.org/10.1080/16078454.2021.1880753; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594943/,269

Indeed, due to the high risk of contamination by patients and by visitors, only essential visits and medical appointments have been authorized. Restricting hospital access to authorized visitors was an important logistic challenge. To deal with this challenge, our institution developed the ExpectingU app to facilitate patient authorization for medical appointments and for visitors to enter the hospital. This article analyzes different trends regarding medical appointments, visitors' invitations, support staff hired and COVID hospitalizations to demonstrate how the ExpectingU system has helped the hospital to maintain accessibility to the hospital.

120424,Constraints on Hebbian and STDP learned weights of a spiking neuron.,2021-01-02,"The association between transportation and the occurrence of the bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) has long been recognised. Many hypotheses regarding this association have been declared through the past decades, and it is agreed upon by most researchers that the multiple stressors that calves experience during transportation result in an overall immunosuppression that allows the respiratory tract to be invaded by numerous opportunistic pathogens. Furthermore, the innate immune cells, neutrophils, may be trapped in a paradox whereby their crucial defence and pathogen-killing activities are counteracted by excessive inflammation and tissue damage that may exacerbate disease, including the BRDC. Neutrophilia in response to glucocorticoids has been attributed to an influx of immature neutrophils newly released from the bone marrow, a decrease in neutrophil margination along endothelial walls, and a decrease in neutrophil apoptosis. Several of these explanations have been confirmed by altered expression of genes and proteins important for neutrophil margination and apoptosis.","Earley, B; Buckham Sporer, K; Gupta, S",Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1751731116001622; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28209213/,269

Here, we report the design of a small molecule (TGP-377) that specifically and potently enhances VEGFA expression by the targeting of a non-coding microRNA that regulates its expression. A selection-based screen, named two-dimensional combinatorial screening, revealed preferences in small-molecule chemotypes that bind RNA and preferences in the RNA motifs that bind small molecules. The screening program increased the dataset of known RNA motif-small molecule binding partners by 20-fold. Analysis of this dataset against the RNA-mediated pathways that regulate VEGFA defined that the microRNA-377 precursor, which represses Vegfa messenger RNA translation, is druggable in a selective manner. We designed TGP-377 to potently and specifically upregulate VEGFA in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. These studies illustrate the power of two-dimensional combinatorial screening to define molecular recognition events between 'undruggable' biomolecules and small molecules, and the ability of sequence-based design to deliver efficacious structure-specific compounds.","Haniff, Hafeez S; Knerr, Laurent; Liu, Xiaohui; Crynen, Gogce; Boström, Jonas; Abegg, Daniel; Adibekian, Alexander; Lekah, Elizabeth; Wang, Kye Won; Cameron, Michael D; Yildirim, Ilyas; Lemurell, Malin; Disney, Matthew D",Nature chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41557-020-0514-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839603/,269

Compared to recent years, the widest range of platforms, both traditional format and array-based, were used. However, as in the past, we found a disappointingly low percentage of well-executed experiments and thoughtful data interpretation. We are alarmed by the high frequency of suboptimal data and over-interpreted results in the literature. Fortunately, learning to visually recognize good--and more importantly, bad--data is easy. Using examples from the literature, we outline several features of biosensor responses that indicate experimental artifacts versus actual binding events.

However, the impact of mental health and stress concerns on relationship and sexuality amidst the COVID-19 lockdown was currently unclear. AIM The cross-sectional study was designed to determine the changes in health, relationship and sexuality among the Chinese couples who lived together amid the early stages of COVID-19 pandemic in China. METHODS Participants of Chinese nationality aged ≥18 years were asked to complete a self-administered online questionnaire regarding sexuality behaviour and impact of event scale (IES) in March 2020. Nonrandom sampling was used for participant recruitment. Also assessed were sociodemographic data including sex, age, employment, region, sexual dysfunction, and whether participants tested positive for COVID-19. OUTCOMES IES score, frequency of sexual intercourse per week, quality of usual sex life, emotional bonding and duration of relationship were measured. RESULTS A total of 1,139 participants (ie, 735 males and 404 females) were included in the study. Mean age and IES of participants was 33.6 ± 9.5 years and 27.4 ± 8.6, respectively. Being male was significantly associated with increased frequency of sexual intercourse amid the COVID-19 pandemic (P = .012). Also, participants with an IES score <26 were more likely to report that they had increased frequency of sexual intercourse per week (P < .001) and the COVID-19 pandemic had positively affected the quality of their usual sex lives (P < .001). On the other hand, participants with IES score ≥26 were more likely to report that the COVID-19 pandemic had positively affected their emotional bonding (P < .001). CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS Frequency of sexual intercourse and quality of sex life in participants who experienced high stressful impact were more likely to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS This was one of the first studies to assess sexual behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic in Chinese adults. Since participants were asked to self-report their sexual behavior, this potentially introduced self-reporting and recall bias into our findings. CONCLUSIONS Our study reported that despite the moderate-to-severe stressful impact due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority reported no significant changes in the frequency of their sexual intercourse per week, quality of their usual sexual lives and emotional bonding.

The relationship between energy consumption, carbon dioxide emissions, and economic growth.",2021-05-11,"INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic fenestration is a standard procedure for the treatment of non-parasitic liver cysts. After fenestration, the remnant liver often restores its volume. However, no systematic analysis of the phenomenon exists. In the present study, the pattern of liver volume restoration after laparoscopic fenestration of liver cysts was analyzed, and the mechanism for the unique restoration was investigated. METHODS Seven patients with giant non-parasitic liver cysts underwent laparoscopic fenestration. Liver volume restoration in each section and changes in the diameter of the portal branch were analyzed after fenestration with CT or MRI. In two patients, regional liver volume restoration was assessed in detail using region-growing software, and change in portal flow distribution was estimated using computational fluid dynamics. Then, the regional liver volume restoration rate was compared with the portal hemodynamic changes. RESULTS Liver volume restoration after fenestration was dependent on the size and position of the cysts; it not uniform throughout the remnant liver. The liver volume restoration in sections that had been compressed by giant cysts was significantly greater than in other areas after fenestration. This volume restoration was accompanied by an increase in the diameters of the portal branches in these sections. In addition, a strong correlation between the regional liver volume restoration rate and the changes in portal flow distribution existed in the computationally analyzed cases. CONCLUSION Liver volume restoration after the fenestration of giant liver cysts non-uniformly occurs in the remnant liver. Improved portal vein circulation in the hepatic area adjacent to the excised giant liver cysts most likely regulates the greater regional volume restoration rate in the area.","Iimuro, Yuji; Okada, Toshihiro; Kondo, Yuichi; Suzumura, Kazuhiro; Uyama, Naoki; Uda, Yugo; Yamanaka, Junichi; Fujimoto, Jiro",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12092; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24520989/,269

Stress detection using physiological signals such as electrocardiogram (ECG), skin conductance (SC), electromyogram (EMG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) is a traditional approach. However, the effect of stress on the EMG signal of different muscles and the efficacy of combination of the EMG and other biological signals for stress detection have not been taken into account yet. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the EMG signal of the right and left trapezius and right and left erector spinae muscles for multi-level stress recognition. Also, the ECG signal was employed to evaluate the efficacy of EMG signals for stress detection. METHODS Both EMG and ECG signals were acquired simultaneously from 34 healthy students (23 females and 11 males, aged 20-37 years). Mental arithmetic, Stroop color-word test, time pressure, and stressful environment were employed to induce stress in the laboratory. RESULTS The accuracies of stress recognition in two, three and four levels were 100%, 97.6%, and 96.2%, respectively, obtained from the distinct combination of feature selection and machine learning algorithms. CONCLUSIONS The comparison of stress detection accuracies resulted from EMG and ECG indicators demonstrated the strong ability and the effectiveness of EMG signal for multi-level stress detection.","Pourmohammadi, Sara; Maleki, Ali",Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2020.105482; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408236/,269

The immune system initiates the autoimmune response, although the mechanisms of neuronal damage have not been elucidated. The purpose of the present study was to investigate autoreactive CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, in conjunction with other inflammatory cells and cytokines in active MS lesions. METHODS EAE animal models was established by plantar injections of MBP (200 μg per rat). Purified CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells were isolated from heparinized peripheral blood (EAE animals and control animals) via negative selection. To examine effects of presence of autoreactive CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, we carried out ELISA, Western blot analysis and TUNEL. In addition, we examined the direct effects of various factors on neuronal cell death using MTT assay. RESULTS The data revealed that CD8+ T-cells were more toxic to neurons compared to CD4+ T-cells, in both the MBP and EAE conditions. Bax was greater increased when neurons were co-cultured with CD8+ T-cells in the MBP group. There is a significant increase in IL-17 secretion by CD4+ T-cells in both the MBP group and EAE group. Neuronal viability were affected by Perforin (1.5 μg/mL). CONCLUSION The present study extends previous research by demonstrating the role of CD8+ T-cells in MS and supports perforin secretion by CD8+ T-cells as a potential therapeutic factor. Furthermore, we determined that CD4+ T-cells can enhance CD8+ T-cell neuronal cytotoxicity via induction of intense inflammation.","Zhao, Daidi; Feng, Fuqiang; Zhao, Cong; Wu, Fang; Ma, Chao; Bai, Yanan; Guo, Jun; Li, Hongzeng",Neurological research,https://doi.org/10.1080/01616412.2017.1398371; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29105578/,269

The U.S. federal government's recommended vaccination schedule, meant to assist states with vaccine allocation, demonstrates fair ethical considerations, however, difficulties remain comparing various groups to determine fair vaccine access and distribution. Although strides have been taken to analyse risks versus benefits of early vaccination across certain high-risk populations, prioritizing vulnerable populations versus essential workers remains challenging for multiple reasons. Similarly, as COVID-19 vaccine allocation and distribution continues in the U.S. and in other countries, topics that require continued consideration include sub-prioritization among currently prioritized groups, prioritization among vulnerable groups disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, like ethnic minorities, and holistic comparisons between groups who might receive various and disparate benefits from vaccination. Although all current COVID-19 vaccines are emergency authorization use only and a vaccine-mandate would be considered only once these vaccines are licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, future vaccination policies require time and deliberation. Similarly, given current vaccine hesitancy, mandatory vaccination of certain groups, like healthcare personnel, may need to be considered when these vaccines are licensed, especially if voluntary vaccination proves insufficient. Continued discussions regarding risks versus benefits of mandatory COVID-19 vaccination and the unique role of healthcare personnel in providing a safe healthcare environment could lead to better deliberation regarding potential policies. This commentary aims to address both questions of fair prioritization and sub-prioritization of various groups, as well as ethical considerations for mandatory COVID-19 vaccination among healthcare personnel.","Hughes, Katarina; Gogineni, Vinaya; Lewis, Chandani; Deshpande, Abhishek",Current medical research and opinion,https://doi.org/10.1080/03007995.2021.1908245; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33760673/,269

Aim: In light of the dynamic developments and consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for the care of people in need of long-term care the following questions arise: How do leaders of care facilities perceive the challenges, how burdened are they and how do they cope with these? METHODS Leaders from outpatient and inpatient nursing and hospice care facilities were contacted by e-mail to participate in an online survey. Closed questions were analysed descriptively, open information was analysed by content analysis. RESULTS From of 4,333 nursing facilities contacted, usable information was available from 525 persons. The greatest pandemic-related, interdependent challenges include concern about infections of patients and employees, procurement of protective equipment, compliance with hygiene regulations, inconsistency and lack of transparency of information and guidelines that are important for work, and loss of income and lead to a cascade of burdens. Around 40 % of respondents are uncertain whether they can cope with these. According to the respondents, the well-being and presenteeism of the leaders surveyed has deteriorated in the course of the pandemic outbreak and they appeared to be more often ill at work. Financial and structural measures, the strengthening of social cohesion and explanation were mentioned as coping strategies. CONCLUSIONS The results show an increase in challenges and illustrate interdependent pandemic-related burdens. These are mainly met by overtime and additional effort, especially on the part of leaders.

131932,"1,3-Propanediol production from glycerol in polyurethane foam containing anaerobic reactors: performance and biomass cultivation and retention.",2020-08-15,"BACKGROUND In response to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the impact of COVID-19, national and subnational governments implemented a variety of measures in order to control the spread of the virus and the associated disease. While these measures were imposed with the intention of controlling the pandemic, they were also associated with severe psychosocial, societal, and economic implications on a societal level. One setting affected heavily by these measures is the school setting. By mid-April 2020, 192 countries had closed schools, affecting more than 90% of the world's student population. In consideration of the adverse consequences of school closures, many countries around the world reopened their schools in the months after the initial closures. To safely reopen schools and keep them open, governments implemented a broad range of measures. The evidence with regards to these measures, however, is heterogeneous, with a multitude of study designs, populations, settings, interventions and outcomes being assessed. To make sense of this heterogeneity, we conducted a rapid scoping review (8 October to 5 November 2020). This rapid scoping review is intended to serve as a precursor to a systematic review of effectiveness, which will inform guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). This review is reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist and was registered with the Open Science Framework. OBJECTIVES To identify and comprehensively map the evidence assessing the impacts of measures implemented in the school setting to reopen schools, or keep schools open, or both, during the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic, with particular focus on the types of measures implemented in different school settings, the outcomes used to measure their impacts and the study types used to assess these. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, MEDLINE, Embase, the CDC COVID-19 Research Articles Downloadable Database for preprints, and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease on 8 October 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA We included studies that assessed the impact of measures implemented in the school setting. Eligible populations were populations at risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2, or developing COVID-19 disease, or both, and included people both directly and indirectly impacted by interventions, including students, teachers, other school staff, and contacts of these groups, as well as the broader community. We considered all types of empirical studies, which quantitatively assessed impact including epidemiological studies, modelling studies, mixed-methods studies, and diagnostic studies that assessed the impact of relevant interventions beyond diagnostic test accuracy. Broad outcome categories of interest included infectious disease transmission-related outcomes, other harmful or beneficial health-related outcomes, and societal, economic, and ecological implications. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We extracted data from included studies in a standardized manner, and mapped them to categories within our a priori logic model where possible. Where not possible, we inductively developed new categories. In line with standard expectations for scoping reviews, the review provides an overview of the existing evidence regardless of methodological quality or risk of bias, and was not designed to synthesize effectiveness data, assess risk of bias, or characterize strength of evidence (GRADE). MAIN RESULTS We included 42 studies that assessed measures implemented in the school setting. The majority of studies used mathematical modelling designs (n = 31), while nine studies used observational designs, and two studies used experimental or quasi-experimental designs. Studies conducted in real-world contexts or using real data focused on the WHO European region (EUR; n = 20), the WHO region of the Americas (AMR; n = 13), the West Pacific region (WPR; n = 6), and the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR; n = 1). One study conducted a global assessment and one did not report on data from, or that were applicable to, a specific country. Three broad intervention categories emerged from the included studies: organizational measures to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (n = 36), structural/environmental measures to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (n = 11), and surveillance and response measures to detect SARS-CoV-2 infections (n = 19). Most studies assessed SARS-CoV-2 transmission-related outcomes (n = 29), while others assessed healthcare utilization (n = 8), other health outcomes (n = 3), and societal, economic, and ecological outcomes (n = 5). Studies assessed both harmful and beneficial outcomes across all outcome categories. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We identified a heterogeneous and complex evidence base of measures implemented in the school setting. This review is an important first step in understanding the available evidence and will inform the development of rapid reviews on this topic.","Krishnaratne, Shari; Pfadenhauer, Lisa M; Coenen, Michaela; Geffert, Karin; Jung-Sievers, Caroline; Klinger, Carmen; Kratzer, Suzie; Littlecott, Hannah; Movsisyan, Ani; Rabe, Julia E; Rehfuess, Eva; Sell, Kerstin; Strahwald, Brigitte; Stratil, Jan M; Voss, Stephan; Wabnitz, Katharina; Burns, Jacob",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd013812; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33331665/,269

Acute mountain sickness is often associated with fluid retention, to which an elevated cortisol may contribute. Most investigators report a rise in resting cortisol with ascent, but little data exist regarding the cortisol response to a day trekking. We therefore measured salivary cortisol during ascent to > 5000 m in a cohort of between 42-45 subjects following a 6-h trek (samples taken between 15:30-16:30 h) and between 15-20 subjects at rest (morning samples taken between 08:00-09:00 h). Morning resting cortisol [nmol/l, mean±sd, (range)] was 5.5±2.9 (2.13-13.61) at 1300 m; 4.7±6.8 (1.4-27.02) at 3400 m, and significantly (p=0.002) rose between 4270 m [3.5±2.1 (1.4-8.34)] and 5150 m [14.5±30.3 (1.9-123.1)]. Post-exercise cortisol [nmol/l, mean±sd, (range)] dropped between 3400 m [7±6 (1.5-33.3)] and 4270 m [4.2±4.8 (1.4-29.5)] (p=0.001) followed by a significant rise in post-exercise cortisol between 4270 m [4.2±4.8 (1.4-29.5)] and 5 150 m [9.2±10.2 (1.4-61.3)] (p<0.001). There were no significant associations between severity of acute mountain sickness and cortisol levels. There was a significant though weak correlation between cortisol post-exercise at 5150 m and oxygen saturation at 5150 m (rho= - 0.451, p=0.004). In conclusion, this is the largest cohort to have their resting and post-exercise cortisol levels ascertained at high altitude. We confirm the previous findings of an elevated resting morning cortisol at > 5000 m, but present the novel finding that the cortisol response to a day trekking at HA appears suppressed at 4270 m.","Woods, D R; Davison, A; Stacey, M; Smith, C; Hooper, T; Neely, D; Turner, S; Peaston, R; Mellor, A",Hormone and metabolic research = Hormon- und Stoffwechselforschung = Hormones et metabolisme,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0032-1304322; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22368038/,269

OBJECTIVES The aim of this multinational registry is to present a real-world overview of TMVR use in Europe. METHODS The Transcatheter Valve Treatment Sentinel Pilot Registry is a prospective, independent, consecutive collection of individual patient data. RESULTS A total of 628 patients (mean age 74.2 ± 9.7 years, 63.1% men) underwent TMVR between January 2011 and December 2012 in 25 centers in 8 European countries. The prevalent pathogenesis was functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) (n = 452 [72.0%]). The majority of patients (85.5%) were highly symptomatic (New York Heart Association functional class III or higher), with a high logistic EuroSCORE (European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation) (20.4 ± 16.7%). Acute procedural success was high (95.4%) and similar in FMR and degenerative mitral regurgitation (p = 0.662). One clip was implanted in 61.4% of patients. In-hospital mortality was low (2.9%), without significant differences between groups. The estimated 1-year mortality was 15.3%, which was similar for FMR and degenerative mitral regurgitation. The estimated 1-year rate of rehospitalization because of heart failure was 22.8%, significantly higher in the FMR group (25.8% vs. 12.0%, p[log-rank] = 0.009). Paired echocardiographic data from the 1-year follow-up, available for 368 consecutive patients in 15 centers, showed a persistent reduction in the degree of mitral regurgitation at 1 year (6.0% of patients with severe mitral regurgitation). CONCLUSIONS This independent, contemporary registry shows that TMVR is associated with high immediate success, low complication rates, and sustained 1-year reduction of the severity of mitral regurgitation and improvement of clinical symptoms.","Nickenig, Georg; Estevez-Loureiro, Rodrigo; Franzen, Olaf; Tamburino, Corrado; Vanderheyden, Marc; Lüscher, Thomas F; Moat, Neil; Price, Susanna; Dall'Ara, Gianni; Winter, Reidar; Corti, Roberto; Grasso, Carmelo; Snow, Thomas M; Jeger, Raban; Blankenberg, Stefan; Settergren, Magnus; Tiroch, Klaus; Balzer, Jan; Petronio, Anna Sonia; Büttner, Heinz-Joachim; Ettori, Federica; Sievert, Horst; Fiorino, Maria Giovanna; Claeys, Marc; Ussia, Gian Paolo; Baumgartner, Helmut; Scandura, Salvatore; Alamgir, Farqad; Keshavarzi, Freidoon; Colombo, Antonio; Maisano, Francesco; Ebelt, Henning; Aruta, Patrizia; Lubos, Edith; Plicht, Björn; Schueler, Robert; Pighi, Michele; Di Mario, Carlo",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2014.06.1166; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25169171/,269

However, how best to disseminate youth participatory research evidence to impact health policy is not known. Therefore, the objectives of this systematic review are to describe the evidence produced through youth participatory research, including the strategies used to disseminate youth participatory research evidence to health policymakers. These are necessary to improve policymakers' use of youth participatory research evidence and, thereby, make programmes more impactful for young people. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The meta-narrative methodology will guide the systematic review to highlight the contrasting and complementary evidence on the use of engaging youth in research to affect health policymaking. Relevant studies will be identified by searching electronic databases, including but not limited to EBSCO, PROQUEST, OVID Medline, Sociological Abstracts and Google Scholar from inception to December 2020. The methodological quality of included quantitative, qualitative and mixed-methods research studies will be assessed using valid appraisal tools. The meta-narrative approach to analysis will include identifying meta-narratives of how youth participation informed the health research findings. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION An advisory group of young people will advise on the study and dissemination of the findings. As part of our plan for active dissemination, we will produce a policy brief that builds the rationale for using research with and by youth as part of an evidence base necessary for achieving youth health outcomes.","Njelesani, Janet; Hunleth, Jean",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-036522; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32784255/,269

DESIGN Evaluation study. SAMPLE POPULATION 17 veterinarians at 1 institution. PROCEDURES Basic skills were tested by use of the McGill inanimate system for training and evaluation of laparoscopic skills (MISTELS). Surgical performance was assessed through an objective structured assessment of technical skills (OSATS). Both tests were performed prior to and after a 12-session training program, consisting of MISTELS exercises (curriculum A) or a variety of exercises (curriculum B). RESULTS Curriculum B led to improvement of scores obtained with both the MISTELS and the OSATS. Curriculum A did not result in higher scores obtained with the MISTELS, compared with curriculum B. Curriculum A did not lead to an improvement of scores obtained with the OSATS. Participant-perceived value of the training program was correlated positively with the improvement of scores for MISTELS suturing tasks and scores obtained with the OSATS. Time spent in clinical laparoscopic surgery and curriculum B training were both positively correlated with the post-training OSATS scores but not with post-training MISTELS scores. Conversely, simulation training time correlated with an increase in MISTELS scores but not OSATS scores. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE MISTELS training resulted in significant improvement of basic laparoscopic skills but not in the assessment used for surgical performance. This may have been due to the small number of study participants, the assessment tool, or the method of training. A varied curriculum may be advantageous when training veterinarians for clinical laparoscopic practice.","Fransson, Boel A; Ragle, Claude A; Bryan, Margaret E",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.241.4.451; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22852570/,269

METHODS We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and Web of Science databases to identify any reported cases of maternal, fetal or neonatal mortality associated with COVID-19 infection. The references of relevant studies were also hand-searched. RESULTS Of 2815 studies screened, 10 studies reporting 37 maternal and 12 perinatal mortality cases (7 fetal demise and 5 neonatal death) were finally eligible for inclusion to this review. All maternal deaths were seen in women with previous co-morbidities, of which the most common were obesity, diabetes, asthma and advanced maternal age. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severity of pneumonia were considered as the leading causes of all maternal mortalities, except for one case who died of thromboembolism during postpartum period. Fetal and neonatal mortalities were suggested to be a result of the severity of maternal infection or the prematurity, respectively. Interestingly, there was no evidence of vertical transmission or positive COVID-19 test result among expired neonates. CONCLUSION Current available evidence suggested that maternal mortality mostly happened among women with previous co-morbidities and neonatal mortality seems to be a result of prematurity rather than infection. However, further reports are needed so that the magnitude of the maternal and perinatal mortality could be determined more precisely.","Hessami, Kamran; Homayoon, Nahid; Hashemi, Atefe; Vafaei, Homeira; Kasraeian, Maryam; Asadi, Nasrin","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2020.1806817; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32799712/,269

The influences of processing parameters, including polymer concentration and solvent mixture composition on the scaffold microstructure are investigated. However, using the TIPS technique, a limited pore size range is generally obtained. To yield the well-interconnected macroporous structures with equiaxed pores and nanofibrous architectures, the TIPS technique is combined with particulate leaching. The macroporous structure of produced scaffolds duplicates the predefined three-dimensional template structure. The homogenous macrostructure with well-interconnected equiaxed pores and no particular orientation is created. Modulating the size and shape of microspheres has precise control over porosity, pore size, and interconnection of the matrix. Because of the well-interconnected macroporous nanofibrous structure, the useful applications of these scaffolds in the tissue engineering field are expected.","Sabzi, E; Abbasi, F; Ghaleh, H",Journal of biomaterials science.

Multiple methods were employed to determine if intrinsic triclosan resistance reflected resistance to hydrophobic molecules by virtue of outer membrane impermeability. While all but one organism isolated in the absence of triclosan were able to initiate growth on MacConkey agar, only one was able to initiate significant growth with triclosan present. In contrast, all bacteria selected with triclosan were identified as Pseudomonas spp. using 16S RNA gene sequencing and exhibited growth comparable to Pseudomonas aeruginosa controls in the presence of hydrophobic antibacterial agents to include triclosan. Two representative bacteria isolated in the absence of triclosan allowed for greater outer membrane association with the fluorescent hydrophobic probe 1-N-phenylnapthylamine than did two triclosan-resistant isolates. Compound 48/80 disruption of outer membrane impermeability properties for hydrophobic substances either partially or fully sensitized nine of twelve intrinsically resistant isolates to triclosan. These data suggest that outer membrane exclusion underlies intrinsic resistance to triclosan in some, but not all Pseudomonas spp. isolated by selection from municipal surface waters and implicates the involvement of concomitant triclosan resistance mechanisms.","Chambers, Lauren E; Chang, Mang; Boyina, Kavya; Williams, Ashton; Dye, Rebecca; Miller, Robert V; DeGear, Michelle A; Assefa, Senait; Köhler, Gerwald A; Champlin, Franklin R","Journal of environmental science and health.

Regret could lead to physical and mental morbidity and questions the appropriateness of these procedures in selected patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of regret in transgender individuals who underwent GAS and evaluate associated factors. Methods A systematic review of several databases was conducted. Random-effects meta-analysis, meta-regression, and subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed. Results A total of 27 studies, pooling 7928 transgender patients who underwent any type of GAS, were included. The pooled prevalence of regret after GAS was 1% (95% CI <1%-2%). Overall, 33% underwent transmasculine procedures and 67% transfemenine procedures. The prevalence of regret among patients undergoing transmasculine and transfemenine surgeries was <1% (IC <1%-<1%) and 1% (CI <1%-2%), respectively. A total of 77 patients regretted having had GAS. Twenty-eight had minor and 34 had major regret based on Pfäfflin's regret classification. The majority had clear regret based on Kuiper and Cohen-Kettenis classification. Conclusions Based on this review, there is an extremely low prevalence of regret in transgender patients after GAS. We believe this study corroborates the improvements made in regard to selection criteria for GAS. However, there is high subjectivity in the assessment of regret and lack of standardized questionnaires, which highlight the importance of developing validated questionnaires in this population.","Bustos, Valeria P; Bustos, Samyd S; Mascaro, Andres; Del Corral, Gabriel; Forte, Antonio J; Ciudad, Pedro; Kim, Esther A; Langstein, Howard N; Manrique, Oscar J",Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

154069,Marine cloud brightening.,2012,"Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a novel swine enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes serious vomiting and diarrhea in piglets. Previous work demonstrated that PDCoV infection inhibits type I interferon (IFN) production. Here, we found that ectopic expression of PDCoV nsp10 significantly inhibited Sendai virus (SeV)-induced IFN-β production by impairing the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of two transcription factors, IRF3 and NF-κB p65 subunit. Interestingly, experiments with truncated mutants and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that PDCoV nsp10 mutants with missing or destroyed zinc fingers (ZFs) domains also impeded SeV-induced IFN-β production, suggesting that nsp10 does not require its ZF domains to antagonize IFN-β production. Further work found that co-expression of nsp10 with nsp14 or nsp16, two replicative enzymes, significantly enhanced the inhibitory effects of nsp10 on IFN-β. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PDCoV nsp10 antagonizes IFN via a ZF-independent mechanism and has a synergistic effect with nsp14 and nsp16 on inhibiting IFN-β production.","Fang, Puxian; Hong, Yingying; Xia, Sijin; Zhang, Jiansong; Ren, Jie; Zhou, Yanrong; Fang, Liurong; Xiao, Shaobo",Virology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2021.03.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33813212/,269

While a broad range of therapeutics effectively reduce the incidence of focal white matter inflammation and plaque formation for patients with relapse-remitting forms of MS, a challenge within the field is to develop therapies that allow for axonal protection and remyelination. In the last decade, growing interest has focused on utilizing neural precursor cells (NPCs) to promote remyelination. To understand how NPCs function in chronic demyelinating environments, several excellent pre-clinical mouse models have been developed. One well accepted model is infection of susceptible mice with neurotropic variants of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) that undergo chronic demyelination exhibiting clinical and histopathologic similarities to MS patients. Combined with the possibility that an environmental agent such as a virus could trigger MS, the MHV model of demyelination presents a relevant mouse model to assess the therapeutic potential of NPCs transplanted into an environment in which inflammatory-mediated demyelination is established.","Marro, Brett S; Blanc, Caroline A; Loring, Jeanne F; Cahalan, Michael D; Lane, Thomas E",Expert review of neurotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1586/14737175.2014.955854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25245576/,269

Immediately after the injury, he suffered painless sustained incomplete erection. High-flow priapism was diagnosed on the basis of color doppler ultrasonography findings. Computed tomography scan showed a high-flow arterio-venous fistula with feeders from branches of the right internal iliac artery. Selective arteriography of the right internal pudendal artery demonstrated an arterio-cavernous fistula. The fistula was superselectively embolized with ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer (Onyx(®)) liquid agent and disappeared completely. Improvement was noted, with significant detumescence on table. This was later confirmed on repeat color Doppler imaging. At follow-up 3 months later, he had normal erectile function.

158678,Optimal temperature zone for the dispersal of COVID-19.,2020-05-16,"BACKGROUND While periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) has a huge impact on patient function and health, only a few studies have investigated its impact on mortality. The purpose of this large-scale study was to (1) determine the rate and trends of in-hospital mortality for PJI and (2) compare the in-hospital mortality rate of patients with PJI and those undergoing revision arthroplasty for aseptic failure and patients undergoing other nonorthopedic major surgical procedures. METHODS Data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 2002 to 2010 were analyzed to determine the risk of in-hospital mortality for PJI patients compared with aseptic revision arthroplasty. The Elixhauser comorbidity index was used to obtain patient comorbidities. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to examine whether PJI and other patient-related factors were associated with mortality. RESULTS PJI was associated with an increased risk (odds ratio, 2.05; P < .0001) of in-hospital mortality (0.77%) compared with aseptic revisions (0.38%). The in-hospital mortality rate of revision total hip arthroplasties with PJI was higher than those for interventional coronary procedures (1.22%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-1.24), cholecystectomy (1.13%; 95% CI, 1.11-1.15), kidney transplant (0.70%; 95% CI, 0.61-0.79), and carotid surgery (0.89%; 95% CI, 0.86-0.93). CONCLUSION Patients undergoing treatment for PJI have a 2-fold increase in in-hospital mortality for each surgical admission compared to aseptic revisions. Considering that PJI cases often have multiple admissions and that this analysis is by surgical admission, the risk of mortality will accumulate for every additional surgery. Surgeons should be cognizant of the potentially fatal outcome of PJI and the importance of infection control to reduce the risk of mortality.","Shahi, Alisina; Tan, Timothy L; Chen, Antonia F; Maltenfort, Mitchell G; Parvizi, Javad",The Journal of arthroplasty,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arth.2016.09.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27816369/,269

BACKGROUND Symptomatic gallstones represent an important public health problem with LC the treatment of choice. LC is increasingly offered for acute cholecystitis, however, the optimal time-point for LC in this setting remains a matter of debate. METHODS Analysis was based on the prospective database of the Swiss Association of Laparoscopic and Thoracoscopic Surgery and included patients undergoing emergency LC for acute cholecystitis between 1995 and 2006, grouped according to the time-points of LC since hospital admission (admission day (d0), d1, d2, d3, d4/5, d ≥6). Linear and generalized linear regression models assessed the effect of timing of LC on intra- or postoperative complications, conversion and reoperation rates and length of postoperative hospital stay. RESULTS Of 4113 patients, 52.8% were female, median age was 59.8 years. Delaying LC resulted in significantly higher conversion rates (from 11.9% at d0 to 27.9% at d ≥6 days after admission, P < 0.001), surgical postoperative complications (5.7% to 13%, P < 0.001) and re-operation rates (0.9% to 3%, P = 0.007), with a significantly longer postoperative hospital stay (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Delaying LC for acute cholecystitis has no advantages, resulting in significantly increased conversion/re-operation rate, postoperative complications and longer postoperative hospital stay. This investigation-one of the largest in the literature-provides compelling evidence that acute cholecystitis merits surgery within 48 hours of hospital admission if impact on the patient and health care system is to be minimized.","Banz, Vanessa; Gsponer, Thomas; Candinas, Daniel; Güller, Ulrich",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0b013e318228d31c; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21817893/,269

We estimated the sensitivity of CT by applying unilist capture-recapture methods on data from the 2018-2020 outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We applied different distributional assumptions to the zero-truncated count data to estimate the number of unobserved cases with a) any contacts and b) infected contacts, to compute CT sensitivity. Geometric distributions were the best fitting models. Our results indicate that CT efforts identified almost all (n=792, 99%) of the cases with any contacts, but only half (n=207, 48%) of the cases with infected contacts, suggesting that CT efforts performed well at identifying contacts during the listing stage, but performed poorly during the contact follow-up stage.

Mutations in the Spike protein are highly scrutinized for their impact on transmissibility, pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy. Here, we contribute to the growing body of literature on emerging variants by evaluating the impact of single mutations on the overall antigenicity of selected variants and their binding to the ACE2 receptor. We observe a differential contribution of single mutants to the global variants phenotype related to ACE2 interaction and antigenicity. Using biolayer interferometry, we observe that enhanced ACE2 interaction is mostly modulated by a decrease in off-rate. Finally, we made the interesting observation that the Spikes from tested emerging variants bind better to ACE2 at 37°C compared to the D614G variant. Whether improved ACE2 binding at higher temperature facilitates emerging variants transmission remain to be demonstrated.","Gong, Shang Yu; Chatterjee, Debashree; Richard, Jonathan; Prévost, Jérémie; Tauzin, Alexandra; Gasser, Romain; Bo, Yuxia; Vézina, Dani; Goyette, Guillaume; Gendron-Lepage, Gabrielle; Medjahed, Halima; Roger, Michel; Côté, Marceline; Finzi, Andrés",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.04.455140,269
163502,A Kinematic Error Observer for Robot End Effector Estimation,2020-12-31,"Motivation Variant analysis is a core task in bioinformatics that requires integrating data from many sources. This process can be helped by using 3D structures of proteins, which can provide a spatial context that can provide insight into how variants affect function. Many available tools can help with mapping variants onto structures; but each has specific restrictions, with the result that many researchers fail to benefit from valuable insights that could be gained from structural data. Results To address this, we have created a streamlined system for incorporating 3D structures into variant analysis. Variants can be easily specified via URLs that are easily readable and writable, and use the notation recommended by the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS). For example, ‘https://aquaria.app/SARS-CoV-2/S/?N501Y’ specifies the N501Y variant of SARS-CoV-2 S protein. In addition to mapping variants onto structures, our system provides summary information from multiple external resources, including COSMIC, CATH-FunVar, and PredictProtein. Furthermore, our system identifies and summarizes structures containing the variant, as well as the variant-position. Our system supports essentially any mutation for any well-studied protein, and uses all available structural data — including models inferred via very remote homology — integrated into a system that is fast and simple to use. By giving researchers easy, streamlined access to a wealth of structural information during variant analysis, our system will help in revealing novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying protein function in health and disease.

We investigated pneumococcal serotype distribution, secular trends and proportion of pneumonia caused by serotypes included in PCV13, PCV15, PCV20, and the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) among adult patients with all-cause community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) between 2013 and 2019. We applied logistic mixed regression modelling to assess annual trends. Urine samples from adult patients with CAP treated in the community or hospital in Germany and included in the CAPNETZ study, a prospective multi-centre cohort study, were analysed by two serotype-specific multiplex urinary antigen detection assays (UAD1/UAD2) at Pfizer's Vaccines Research and Development Laboratory. UAD1 detects serotypes in PCV13, UAD2 detects additional serotypes in PCV20 plus serotypes 2, 9N, 17F and 20. Out of 1,831 patients screened, urine samples with a valid UAD test result were available for 1,343 patients (73.3%). Among those patients, 829 patients (61.7%) were male, 792 patients (59,0%) were aged 60 years and above, 1038 patients (77.3%) had at least one comorbidity and 1,204 patients (89.7%) were treated in the hospital. The overall proportion of vaccine-type pneumonia among all-cause CAP for PCV13, PCV15, PCV20 and PPV23 was 7.7% (n=103), 9.1% (n=122), 12.3% (n=165) and 13.3% (n=178). Over the entire observation period, we did not observe evidence for significant annual trends in pneumococcal vaccine serotype coverage against pneumonia in adults (PCV13: OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83-1.05; PCV15: OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.84-1.03; PCV20: OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.86-1.04; PPV23: OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.90-1.08). In conclusion, our data show that i) the infant vaccination program of PCV13, which started in Germany 2010 did not result in a relevant and sustained decrease of PCV13 serotypes in pneumonia in adults and ii) that the gap in the coverage between PCV20 and PPV23 was small and did not increase over the entire observation time.","Bahrs, C.; Kesselmeier, M.; Kolditz, M.; Ewig, S.; Rohde, G.; Barten-Neiner, G.; Rupp, J.; Witzenrath, M.; Welte, T.; Pletz, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.07.21264682v1?rss=1,269

167519,Arc Behavior in Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing Process,2020-12-31,"Many acute and chronic lung diseases affect the distal lung alveoli. Although airway-derived human cell lines exist, alveolar epithelial cell (AEC)-derived lines are needed to better model these diseases. We have generated and characterized novel immortalized cell lines derived from human AECs. They grow as epithelial monolayers expressing lung progenitor markers SOX9 and SOX2, with little to no expression of mature AEC markers. Co-cultured in 3-dimensions (3D) with lung fibroblasts, the cells form NKX2-1+ organoids expressing mature AEC markers AQP5 and GPRC5A. Single-cell RNA sequencing of an AEC line in 2D versus 3D revealed increased cellular heterogeneity and induction of cytokine and lipoprotein signaling, consistent with organoid formation.

The mRNA technology is an unprecedented vaccine, usually given in two doses to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections. Despite effectiveness and safety, inter-individual immune response heterogeneity has been observed in recipients of mRNA-based vaccines. As a novel disease, the specific immune response mechanism responsible for warding off COVID-19 remains unclear at this point. However, significant evidence suggests that humoral response plays a crucial role in affording immunoprotection and preventing debilitating sequelae from COVID-19. As such this paper focused on the possible effects of age, sex, serostatus, and comorbidities on humoral response (i.e., total antibodies, IgG and/or IgA) of different populations post-mRNA-based Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination. A systematic search of literature was performed through PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Google Scholar. Studies were included if they reported humoral response to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. A total of 32 studies was identified and reviewed, and the percent difference of means of reported antibody levels were calculated for comparison. Findings revealed that older individuals, the male sex, seronegativity, and those with more comorbidities mounted less humoral immune response. Given these findings, several recommendations were proposed regarding the current vaccination practices. These include giving additional doses of vaccination for immunocompromised and elderly populations. Another recommendation is conducting clinical trials in giving a combined scheme of mRNA vaccines, protein vaccines, and vector-based vaccines.","Notarte, K. I.; Ver, A. T.; Velasco, J.

Quantification of complex non-intuitive dynamics and transport of pathogen laden respiratory particles in indoor flows has been of specific interest. Here we present a Lagrangian computational approach towards quantification of human-to-human exposure quantifiers, and identification of pathways by which flow organizes transmission. We develop a Lagrangian viral exposure index in a parametric form, accounting for key parameters such as building and layout, ventilation, occupancy, biological variables. We also employ a Lagrangian computation of the Finite Time Lyapunov Exponent field to identify hidden patterns of transport. A systematic parametric study comprising a set of 120 simulations, yielding a total of 1,320 different exposure index computations are presented. Results from these simulations enable: (a) understanding the otherwise hidden ways in which air flow organizes the long-range transport of such particles; and (b) translating the micro-particle transport data into a quantifier for understanding infection exposure risks.","Wilson, J.; Miller, S.

When expressed together, coronavirus M and E proteins are sufficient to facilitate budding into the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). To help elucidate budding, we ran atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the Feig laboratory’s refined structural models of the SARS-CoV-2 M protein dimer and E protein pentamer. Our MD simulations consisted of M protein dimers and E protein pentamers in patches of membrane. By examining where these proteins induced membrane curvature in silico, we obtained insights around how the budding process may occur. The M protein dimers acted cooperatively to induce membrane curvature while E protein pentamers kept the membrane planar. These results could eventually help guide the development of antiviral therapeutics which inhibit coronavirus budding.","Collins, Logan T.; Elkholy, Tamer; Mubin, Shafat; Hill, David; Williams, Ricky; Ezike, Kayode; Singhal, Ankush",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.26.453874,269

Therefore, the study examines the determinants of savings creation within MEAT in Central European countries. It uses a dataset published in the Tenders Electronic Daily database in 2017–2018 about contract award notices and carries out a generalized linear model to study the determinants of savings creation within MEAT. The findings suggest that when services are procured within MEAT, the savings are considerably higher than compared to works. If the framework agreement takes place in a procurement process, the savings are significantly smaller. In cases where the subject of procurement is not co-financed by EU funds, the savings are higher than in the case that they are. If an open type of procurement is used, the savings are seemingly smaller than in cases where a non-open type of procurement takes place. When the contract is awarded to a single supplier, the savings are higher than otherwise. A higher number of total offers, as well as a higher number of offers from small and medium-sized enterprises, induce higher savings. It can be concluded that the use of sustainable public procurement subtly reduces the creation of savings.","Džupka, Peter Kubák Matúš",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su12219241,269

It reflects on the views of students on how these changes impacted their education and personal circumstances. It makes suggestions, based on student observations, on how educators might support students’ LTA learning experiences more effectively. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses an anonymous online questionnaire, imposed by lockdown and closure of universities, to gather the views of HE students across the UK on how COVID-19 and lockdown affected their education and personal circumstances. Using a cross-sectional study, participants were asked to complete several questions, providing quantitative and qualitative data which is analysed for the study. A total of 349 participants took part in the questionnaire and data were analysed descriptively. Findings: Key findings suggest that the use of online virtual classrooms as a substitute for traditional face-to-face LTA has its positives and its negatives. The most significant positives are the “flexible assessments” and “digital content” and, in contrast, one of the significant drawbacks is the lack of interactions, this being true for both male and female students. However, as compared to females, males found to be missing “the campus life” more during the lockdown. Finally, the majority of student felt that there was a lack of support from the university and teaching staff during the lockdown. Universities’ governance must take control of how this issue is driven forward and learn from the experience of students. Originality/value: The study makes three contributions: firstly, using students’ views to open a fresh debate on LTA approaches during the pandemic;secondly, examining the impact on student experiences due to the changes introduced because of lockdown;and finally, suggesting strategies to be implemented by HE management based on the opinions of participating students. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Khan, M.

175967,DEELIG: A Deep Learning-based approach to predict protein-ligand binding affinity,2021-01-03,"Pandemics attack the primary asset (labor) of peasant households and the rural poor. Peasant households must simultaneously allocate labor between farm and household activities, where the demand for agricultural labor is seasonal, which limits intra-temporal substitution, without perfect foresight. A pandemic reduces the supply of labor, through deaths and morbidity, with the scale of reductions in labor supply depending on the seasons in which a pandemic occurs. The analyses, using a recursive dynamic economy-wide model for Bhutan, demonstrate that outbreaks in high labor demand seasons cause increases in wage rates almost three times as high as for outbreaks in low labor demand seasons. Increases in wage rates induce peasant households to reallocate labor time between farm and household activities through the labor-leisure trade-off mechanism. Such changes in the allocation of labor time are important elements of peasants’ mitigation responses, and can reduce the negative economic implications of a pandemic. © 2021 The International Input--Output Association.","Feuerbacher, A.; McDonald, S.; Thierfelder, K.",Economic Systems Research,https://doi.org/10.1080/09535314.2021.1963684,269

The health and socioeconomic consequences of Covid-19 were devastating, severely impacting levels of equality and inclusiveness in the country. In terms of public contestation, hyper-presidentialism and the attempts of the governing party (Morena) to become dominant have eroded checks and balances and limited political plurality in the political system. Morena is building on the bases of the former hegemonic -the PRI- and the PRD, although it faces the hurdle of weak institutionalization - albeit within a party system that is also weak. Overall, the sum of these elements suggests a process of de-democratization in the country. The recent 2021 elections were a relative setback for Morena's attempts to become a dominant party at the federal level, particularly in the Chamber of Deputies, but Morena's political strength was strongly consolidated at the local level.","Petersen, G.; Somuano, F.",Revista De Ciencia Politica,https://doi.org/10.4067/s0718-090x2021005000118,269

Methods: Data on outpatient visits, intestinal infection visits, and tests of adenovirus or rotavirus from electronic healthcare records were extracted in Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine during the COVID-19 outbreak (January-December, 2020), and be compared with those in 2019 during the same period. Results: We found that pediatric outpatient visits, patients with intestinal infection and its proportion from January to December of 2020 were significantly less than that in the same period of 2019. Furthermore, the numbers of outpatient visits and patients with intestinal infection were the lowest in February and elevated slowly from March to December in 2020. We also found significantly decreased number of completed tests for intestinal viruses, positive cases of adenovirus and rotavirus, positive rate of rotavirus during JanuaryDecember, 2020. The positive rates of adenovirus from March to September and December of 2020 were significantly lower than the levels of the same period in 2019. The positive rate of rotavirus and adenovirus in all age groups in 2020 is lower than the level of all age groups in 2019. Conclusions: The outpatient visits and intestinal, rotavirus and adenovirus infections in children significantly decreased during COVID-19 outbreak. Adequate protective measures and isolation in children may help to prevent intestinal virus infections in children.","Li, W.; Zhu, Y. L.; Lou, J. A.; Chen, J.; Xie, X. J.; Mao, J.

Methods: VigiBase data were used to analyze the reported ADEs linked to HCQ. The data were analyzed based on age, gender, and seriousness of ADEs at the System Organ Classification level and the individual Preferred Term level. Results: The majority were above 18 years(91.6%) and from Europe(41.6%). A total of 5,315 ADEs were associated with HCQ use in COVID-19. Of these, 918 ADEs were attributed to CVS and reported from 773 patients. Grossly, CVS ADEs were associated with concomitant use of HCQ and azithromycin(AZM), and only 40 ADEs were solely due to HCQ. The majority were serious (69.3%) and resolved afterward (51%). In CVS ADEs, there were 366 cardiac disorders, 38 vascular disorders, and 514 ADEs under investigation. Among the cardiac disorders, palpitation was the most typical (N=65), followed by bradycardia(N=44) and tachycardia(N=33). Among arrhythmias, QT prolongation (N=469), atrial fibrillation (N=25), and ventricular tachycardia(N=16) were common. The odds of developing serious CVS ADEs increased with age, patients aged 45-64 years(OR=1.75;p=0.015) and &gt;65 years(OR=1.93, p=0.003) as compared to younger ones. Conclusion: Hydroxychloroquine with known CVS toxicities and increased risk with co-administering AZM makes physicians cautious while prescribing in COVID-19 patients.","Dutta, S.; Kaur, R.; Bhardwaj, P.; Deora, S.; Singh, K.; Ambwani, S.; Charan, J.; Abubakar, A.

178826,Comprehensive Review of Deep Reinforcement Learning Methods and Applications in Economics,2020-03-21,"Modern smart grid prospects necessitate handling abnormal operating conditions besides conventional demands for improving power systems capabilities. Uncertain load and generation, and line outages during contingency conditions of electric power systems should be properly and efficiently dealt with. Lately, lockdown situations because of COVID-19 pandemic have greatly influenced energy demands in many areas in the World. Vulnerable operation of power networks, especially in either isolated microgrids or large-scale smart grids can be significantly avoided through proposing optimal reconfigurable network. In this paper, employing the distribution network (DN) reconfiguration is deeply studied for achieving fault-tolerance and fast recovery to reliable configurable DN in smart grids. Since radiality is among crucial properties of DN topology, searching for feasible configuration of DN is NP-hard optimization problem. Therefore, the recent Manta Ray Foraging Optimization (MRFO) is considered for solving such DN optimization instance. Performance of MRFO is examined against two common optimizers: the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO). Different operating conditions for both the IEEE 33-bus and IEEE 85-bus systems are analysed using these optimization techniques. The goal is to search for feasible reconfigured DN with the minimum power losses and the optimal enhanced voltage profile. Simulation results reveal that the proposed MRFO approach provides efficient and outstanding behaviour in various operation scenarios. The efficiency and the robustness of the proposed MRFO approach are verified, the power loss reduction ratio ranges between 21% and 41% in different studied scenarios and adequate voltage profile enhancement is achieved. © 2021","Ramadan, H.

178897,ASGN: An Active Semi-supervised Graph Neural Network for Molecular Property Prediction,2020-07-07,"Various phenomena such as viruses, gossips, and physical objects (e.g., packages and marketing pamphlets) can be spread through physical contacts. The spread depends on how people move, i.e., their mobility patterns. In practice, mobility patterns of an entire population is never available, and we usually have access to location data of a subset of individuals. In this paper, we formalize and study the problem of estimating the spread of a phenomena in a population, given that we only have access to sub-samples of location visits of some individuals in the population. We show that simple solutions that estimate the spread in the sub-sample and scale it to the population, or more sophisticated solutions that rely on modeling location visits of individuals do not perform well in practice. Instead, we directly model the co-locations between the individuals. We introduce PollSpreader and PollSusceptible, two novel approaches that model the co-locations between individuals using a contact network, and infer the properties of the contact network using the sub-sample to estimate the spread of the phenomena in the entire population. We analytically show that our estimates provide an upper bound and a lower bound on the spread of the disease in expectation. Finally, using a large high-resolution real-world mobility dataset, we experimentally show that our estimates are accurate in practice, while other methods that do not correctly account for co-locations between individuals result in entirely wrong observations (e.g, premature prediction of herd-immunity).","Zeighami, S.; Shahabi, C.; Krumm, J.",Proceedings of the Vldb Endowment,https://doi.org/10.14778/3461535.3461544,269
179139,Open Source Software for Efficient and Transparent Reviews,2020-06-22,"Thrombosis and Thromobocytopenia Syndrome (TTS) has been associated with the AstraZencea (AZ) COVID-19 vaccine. Australia has reported low TTS incidence of <3/100,000 after the first dose, with case fatality rate (CFR) of 5-6%. Risk-benefit analysis of vaccination has been challenging because of rapidly evolving data, changing levels of transmission, and age-specific variation in rates of TTS, COVID-19, and CFR. We aim to optimise risk-benefit analysis by developing a model that enables inputs to be updated rapidly as evidence evolves. A Bayesian network was used to integrate local and international data, government reports, published literature and expert opinion. The model estimates probabilities of outcomes under different scenarios of age, sex, low/medium/high transmission (0.05%/0.45%/5.76% of population infected over 6 months), SARS-CoV-2 variant, vaccine doses, and vaccine effectiveness. We used the model to compare estimated deaths from vaccine-associated TTS with i) COVID-19 deaths prevented under different scenarios, and ii) deaths from COVID-19 related atypical severe blood clots (cerebral venous sinus thrombosis & portal vein thrombosis). For a million people aged >70 years where 70% received first dose and 35% received two doses, our model estimated <1 death from TTS, 25 deaths prevented under low transmission, and >3000 deaths prevented under high transmission. Risks versus benefits varied significantly between age groups and transmission levels. Under high transmission, deaths prevented by AZ vaccine far exceed deaths from TTS (by 8 to >4500 times depending on age). Probability of dying from COVID-related atypical severe blood clots was 58-126 times higher (depending on age and sex) than dying from TTS. To our knowledge, this is the first example of the use of Bayesian networks for risk-benefit analysis for a COVID-19 vaccine. The model can be rapidly updated to incorporate new data, adapted for other countries, extended to other outcomes (e.g., severe disease), or used for other vaccines.","Lau, C. L.; Mayfield, H.

Using publicly available event-date data from the ongoing epidemic, the present study investigated the incubation period and other time intervals that govern the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19 infections. Our results show that the incubation period falls within the range of 2-14 days with 95% confidence and has a mean of around 5 days when approximated using the best-fit lognormal distribution. The mean time from illness onset to hospital admission (for treatment and/or isolation) was estimated at 3-4 days without truncation and at 5-9 days when right truncated. Based on the 95th percentile estimate of the incubation period, we recommend that the length of quarantine should be at least 14 days. The median time delay of 13 days from illness onset to death (17 days with right truncation) should be considered when estimating the COVID-19 case fatality risk.","Linton, Natalie M.; Kobayashi, Tetsuro; Yang, Yichi; Hayashi, Katsuma; Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R.; Jung, Sung-mok; Yuan, Baoyin; Kinoshita, Ryo; Nishiura, Hiroshi",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.26.20018754,269

The model is a classical SIR, but is non-autonomous; the rate of susceptible people becoming infected is adjusted over time in order to fit the available data. The death rate is also secondarily adjusted. Our fitting is made under the assumption that due to limiting number of tests, a large part of the infected population has not been tested positive. In the last part, we extend the model to take into account the daily fluxes between New Jersey (NJ) and NY states and fit the data for both states. Our simple model fits the available data, and illustrates typical dynamics of the disease: exponential increase, apex and decrease. The model highlights a decrease in the transmission rate over the period which gives a quantitative illustration about how lockdown policies reduce the spread of the pandemic. The coupled model with NY and NJ states shows a wave in NJ following the NY wave, illustrating the mechanism of spread from one attractive hot spot to its neighbor. }","Ambrosio, Benjamin; Aziz-Alaoui, M.

While China's food self‐sufficiency has been examined at the national and provincial levels, few studies consider lower administrative levels or different food and feed items. This study quantifies self‐sufficiency in the eastern regions of China and examines correlations with agronomic (arable area, yield, fertilizer input, and machinery power) and socioeconomic (population density, gross domestic product [GDP]) variables at the local level, which are related to the interactions of the Sustainable Development Goals. We calculated food and feed balances, and checked correlations across and within regions grouped by population density levels between production, balance indices, and other agronomic and socioeconomic variables. The results showed that most regions can achieve self‐sufficiency in cereals, vegetables, and meat. Regarding eggs and maize, there was self‐sufficiency in the north but deficiency in the south. Nearly all regions demonstrated extreme shortages of milk and soybeans. The results also showed a positive correlation between the production of some food commodities and the population in eastern regions of China, demonstrating that the aim of achieving food self‐sufficiency at the local level is pursued. For cereals, vegetables, and maize, the yield and arable land per capita were positive factors for self‐sufficiency, while GDP per capita was a negative factor for cereals, meat, and maize. Various factors have different impacts on the food and feed self‐sufficiency of regions based on population density. Protecting arable land by rural revitalization and mitigating urban sprawl can retain food and feed self‐sufficiency in large cities. This study outlines important implications for policymakers seeking to achieve food and feed self‐sufficiency in China.","Yang, Li Sun Zhigang Accatino Francesco",Food and Energy Security,https://doi.org/10.1002/fes3.296,269
181601,Rule-based space characterization for rumour detection in health,2021,"Background Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by expression of the cell surface protein B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), a validated target for therapeutic intervention. REGN5458 is a BCMA x CD3 bispecific antibody (Ab) that binds to both BCMA and CD3, thereby targeting MM cells with T-cell effector function via BCMA. Previously, we presented data showing REGN5458 has an acceptable safety profile with evidence of clinical efficacy in heavily pre-treated patients with RRMM. Here we describe the updated safety and response durability in a Phase 1 trial of REGN5458 monotherapy in patients with RRMM (NCT03761108). Methods The primary objectives of the Phase 1 portion of the study are to determine the safety, tolerability, and occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of REGN5458. Key secondary objectives include assessment of objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), minimum residual disease (MRD) status, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics. Enrollment into the Phase 1 portion follows a standard 4+3 dose escalation design. Enrolled patients must have progressive MM after ≥3 prior lines of systemic therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 Ab. Treatment consists of weekly doses of REGN5458, followed by a maintenance phase administered every 2 weeks. Response assessments are according to modified International Myeloma Working Group criteria. MRD is assessed by flow cytometry. Results As of the June 15, 2020 data cut-off, 45 patients were treated with REGN5458. The median age at enrollment was 64.0 years (range, 41−81), of which 14 (31.1%) patients were >70 years. As per Revised International Staging System, 60.0% and 22.2% of patients were stage 2 and 3, respectively. Patients had a median of 5.0 (range, 2−17) prior lines of systemic therapy;32 patients (71.1%) received a prior autologous stem cell transplant. All patients were refractory to an anti-CD38 Ab;6.7% were triple-refractory, 33.3% were quad-refractory, and 53.3% were penta-refractory. REGN5458 was escalated in cohorts from 3−96 mg over six dose levels. The median duration of follow-up was 2.37 months (range, 0.7−12.3). The most common treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) include cytokine release syndrome (CRS;37.8%), fatigue (17.8%), nausea (17.8%), and myalgias (13.3%). CRS occurred primarily during the initial doses and was Grade (Gr) 1 in 88.2% of patients. No patients had Gr >3 CRS. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 6.7% of patients. Infection-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in 46.7% of patients (Gr ≥3 20%). Gr >3 treatment-related neurological events occurred in one patient (Gr 3 syncope 130 days after first infusion). Four patients discontinued due to AE with one patient having a TRAE (also DLT) of Gr 4 acute kidney injury. One patient had a DLT due to transient Gr 3 liver transaminases associated with CRS. Upon recovery, the patient continued study drug and has achieved ongoing partial remission. Gr >3 TRAEs occurred in 28.9% of patients, with the most common being anemia (8.9%) and lymphopenia (6.7%). Serious TRAEs occurred in 22.2% of patients, with the most common due to CRS (11.1%). Gr 5 AEs (all unrelated to study drug) occurred in three patients: two sepsis and one COVID-19. ORR was 35.6% across all dose levels (60% in highest dose level), with 81.3% of responders achieving at least a very good partial response;31.3% had a complete response (CR) or stringent CR. A total of 43.8% of responders had a DOR >4 months and 18.8% had a DOR >8 months. The ORR in patients with extramedullary plasmacytomas was 16.7%. Additional efficacy, PK, and biomarker data will be available at the time of presentation. Conclusions In this updated analysis of the first-in-human study, REGN5458 continues to show an acceptable safety profile and durable efficacy in heavily pre-treated patients with RRMM. Enrollment in the Phase 1 dose escalation portion is ongoing, and the Phase 2 portion of the study is recruiting.

184175,Surveillance of viral pathogens in Australia: respiratory syncytial virus.,2003,"PurposeThe purpose of this study is to develop the theorisation of cybercrime in the context of the pandemic, and to sketch out a vision of how law enforcement might respond to a transformed landscape of online crime and offending.Design/methodology/approachThis conceptual paper draws on empirical evidence from a range of sources (including official statistics) and the existing research literature, and revisits routine activities theory to illuminate the way that cybercrime patterns are being transformed by the pandemic.FindingsThe pandemic is reshaping the routine activities of societies en masse, leading to changes in the ecology of risk and opportunity for cybercrime. There is evidence of a large increase in the prevalence of cybercrime as a result, yet much of this has a paradoxically “local” character.Practical implicationsThe authors identify specific practical implications for law enforcement, namely, that the role of local police in policing cybercrime should be re-envisioned, with a democratic, community-oriented approach at its heart.Originality/valueThe theoretical perspective outlined is a novel and critical development of a well-established framework, opening up new paths to the theorisation of cybercrime and cybercrime policing. The authors’ suggestions for practitioners have the potential for direct impact, both at the level of practice and in terms of broader imaginaries and organisation of police and policing.","Horgan, Shane Collier Ben Jones Richard Shepherd Lynsay",Journal of Criminal Psychology,https://doi.org/10.1108/jcp-08-2020-0034,269

186466,Slope Transit Time (STT): A Pulse Transit Time Proxy requiring Only a Single Signal Fiducial Point.,2016,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a challenge for intensive care units (ICU) in part due to the failure to identify risks for patients early and the inability to render an accurate prognosis. Previous reports suggest a strong association between hypercoagulability and poor outcome. Factors related to hemostasis may, therefore, serve as tools to improve the management of COVID-19 patients. AIM: The purpose of this report is to develop a model to determine whether it is possible to early identify COVID-19 patients at risk for thromboembolic complications (TCs). METHODS: We analyzed electronic health record data of 108 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to the adult ICU of the Erasmus University Medical Center between February 27 and May 20, 2020. By training a decision tree classifier on 66% of the available data, a model for the prediction of TCs was developed. RESULTS: The median (interquartile range) age was 62 (53-70) years and 73% were male. Forty-three patients (40%) developed a TC during their ICU stay. Mortality was higher for patients in the TCs group compared to the control group (26% vs. 8%, P=0.03). Lactate dehydrogenase, standardized bicarbonate, albumin, and leukocytes were identified by the Decision Tree classifier as the most powerful predictors for TCs 2 days before the onset of the TC, with a sensitivity of 73% and a positive likelihood ratio of 2.7 on the test dataset. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically relevant TCs frequently occur in critically ill COVID-19 patients. These can successfully be predicted using a decision tree model. Although this model could be of special importance to aid clinical decision making, its generalizability and clinical impact should be determined in a larger population. RELEVANCE FOR PATIENTS: Recently, severe TCs were observed in COVID-19 patients with progressive respiratory failure warranting ICU treatment. Timely identification of patients at risk of developing TCs is critical inasmuch as it would enable clinicians to initiate potentially salvaging therapeutic anticoagulation.","van de Sande, Davy; van Genderen, Michel E.; Rosman, Babette; Diether, Maren; Endeman, Henrik; van den Akker, Johannes P.

192897,"Infectious diseases notification practices, Victoria 2013.",2016,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in early 2003 to cause a very severe acute respiratory syndrome, which eventually resulted in a 10% case-fatality rate. Owing to excellent public health measures that isolated focus cases and their contacts, and the use of supportive therapies, the epidemic was suppressed to the point that further cases have not appeared since 2005. However, despite intensive research since then (over 3500 publications), it remains an untreatable disease. The potential for re-emergence of the SARS-CoV or a similar virus with unknown but potentially serious consequences remains high. This is due in part to the extreme genetic variability of RNA viruses such as the coronaviruses, the many animal reservoirs that seem to be able host the SARS-CoV in which reassortment or recombination events could occur and the ability coronaviruses have to transmit relatively rapidly from species to species in a short period of time. Thus, it seems prudent to continue to explore and develop antiviral chemotherapies to treat SARS-CoV infections. To this end, the various efficacious anti-SARS-CoV therapies recently published from 2007 to 2010 are reviewed in this article. In addition, compounds that have been tested in various animal models and were found to reduce virus lung titers and/or were protective against death in lethal models of disease, or otherwise have been shown to ameliorate the effects of viral infection, are also reported.","Barnard, Dale L; Kumaki, Yohichi",Future virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21765859/,269
193456,Computational fluid dynamics for turbomachinery internal air systems.,2007,"Predictive modeling often uses black box machine learning methods, such as deep neural networks, to achieve state-of-the-art performance. In scientific domains, the scientist often wishes to discover which features are actually important for making the predictions. These discoveries may lead to costly follow-up experiments and as such it is important that the error rate on discoveries is not too high. Model-X knockoffs [2] enable important features to be discovered with control of the false discovery rate (fdr). However, knockoffs require rich generative models capable of accurately modeling the knockoff features while ensuring they obey the so-called ""swap"" property. We develop Deep Direct Likelihood Knockoffs (ddlk), which directly minimizes the KL divergence implied by the knockoff swap property. ddlk consists of two stages: it first maximizes the explicit likelihood of the features, then minimizes the KL divergence between the joint distribution of features and knockoffs and any swap between them. To ensure that the generated knockoffs are valid under any possible swap, ddlk uses the Gumbel-Softmax trick to optimize the knockoff generator under the worst-case swap. We find ddlk has higher power than baselines while controlling the false discovery rate on a variety of synthetic and real benchmarks including a task involving a large dataset from one of the epicenters of COVID-19.","Sudarshan, Mukund; Tansey, Wesley; Ranganath, Rajesh",Advances in neural information processing systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33953523/,269

The previous PRCV infection failed to protect them against the enteric TGEV infection. Virus excretion in faeces was detected by an ELISA in all the pigs for three to six consecutive days after inoculation. Although little diarrhoea was observed, the infection extended through much of the small intestine of one of the previously infected pigs four days after inoculation. Challenge with TGEV caused a secondary neutralising antibody response. By using a peroxidase conjugate of a monoclonal antibody which recognises a specific antigenic site on TGEV, antibodies against TGEV could be distinguished from antibodies against PRCV in an ELISA blocking test.","van Nieuwstadt, A P; Zetstra, T; Boonstra, J",The Veterinary record,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2549676/,269

MDR-TB and, in particular, the emergence of XDR-TB, have re-opened the debate on the importance, and nature, of treatment supervision for basic TB control and the management of drug-resistant TB. Enforcing compulsory measures regarding TB patients raises questions of respect for human rights. Yet, international law provides for rights-limiting principles, which would justify enforcing compulsory measures against TB patients who refuse to have diagnostic procedures or who refuse to be monitored and treated once disease is confirmed. This article analyzes under what circumstances compulsory measures for TB patients may be enforced under international law. Compulsory measures for TB patients may, in fact, be justified on legal grounds provided that these measures are foreseen in the law, that they are used as a last resort, and that safeguards are in place to protect affected individuals. The deadly nature of the disease, its epidemiology, the high case fatality rate, and the speed at which the disease leads to death when associated with HIV are proven.","Boggio, Andrea; Zignol, Matteo; Jaramillo, Ernesto; Nunn, Paul; Pinet, Geneviève; Raviglione, Mario",Health and human rights,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20845863/,269

Coronary artery aneurysms are a long-term concern because coronary thrombosis with myocardial infarction can be a late manifestation. The origin of Kawasaki disease is unknown, but an infectious agent is most likely. Management consists of aspirin for control of fever and inflammatory manifestations and intravenous gamma globulin for the prevention of coronary aneurysm formation. Careful late follow-up is required, especially for patients with persistent coronary abnormalities. Giant aneurysms (greater than 8 mm) are more likely to progress to coronary obstructive disease, and coronary bypass grafts have been required for some patients. Late coronary artery manifestations in patients with mild early coronary dilatation have not been described.

We studied the association between use of statin/angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/ARB in the month before hospital admission, with risk of severe outcome, and with time to severe outcome or disease recovery, among patients hospitalized for COVID-19. We performed a retrospective single-center study of all patients hospitalized at University of California San Diego Health between February 10, 2020 and June 17, 2020 (nâ¯=â¯170 hospitalized for COVID-19, nâ¯=â¯5,281 COVID-negative controls). Logistic regression and competing risks analyses were used to investigate progression to severe disease (death or intensive care unit admission), and time to discharge without severe disease. Severe disease occurred in 53% of COVID-positive inpatients. Median time from hospitalization to severe disease was 2 days; median time to recovery was 7 days. Statin use prior to admission was associated with reduced risk of severe COVID-19 (adjusted OR 0.29, 95%CI 0.11 to 0.71, p < 0.01) and faster time to recovery among those without severe disease (adjusted HR for recovery 2.69, 95%CI 1.36 to 5.33, p < 0.01).

217593,An external exposome-wide association study of COVID-19 mortality in the United States,2021,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic. An unbalanced immune response, characterized by a weak production of type I interferons (IFN-Is) and an exacerbated release of proinflammatory cytokines, contributes to the severe forms of the disease. SARS-CoV-2 is genetically related to SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which caused outbreaks in 2003 and 2013, respectively. Although IFN treatment gave some encouraging results against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in animal models, its potential as a therapeutic against COVID-19 awaits validation. Here, we describe our current knowledge of the complex interplay between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the IFN system, highlighting some of the gaps that need to be filled for a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms. In addition to the conserved IFN evasion strategies that are likely shared with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, novel counteraction mechanisms are being discovered in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Since the last coronavirus epidemic, we have made considerable progress in understanding the IFN-I response, including its spatiotemporal regulation and the prominent role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which are the main IFN-I-producing cells. While awaiting the results of the many clinical trials that are evaluating the efficacy of IFN-I alone or in combination with antiviral molecules, we discuss the potential benefits of a well-timed IFN-I treatment and propose strategies to boost pDC-mediated IFN responses during the early stages of viral infection.","Sa Ribero, Margarida; Jouvenet, Nolwenn; Dreux, Marlène; Nisole, Sébastien",PLoS Pathog,,269

However, this disease can be largely prevented by adherence to hygienic principles and protective behaviors. It seems that identifying the processes involved in protective health behaviors can be effective in planning and implementing suitable interventions to encourage the community toward protective behaviors. Therefore, the present study aimed to predict the preventive behaviors of COVID-19 according to the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT). METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted over 2 months in Hormozgan Province, Iran. The study population consisted of all citizens above the age of 15 years. An online questionnaire was used to collect the data. The questionnaire link was available to the participants through social networks. The questionnaire consisted of two sections, including the demographic information and the PMT constructs. All statistical calculations and hypothesis testing were performed in SPSS Version 21 and AMOS Version 21. The significance level was considered to be 0.05 for hypothesis testing. RESULTS: A total of 2032 subjects, with the mean age of 34.84 ± 9.8 years (r = 15-98), participated in this study. Most of the participants were 31-40 years old, female (60.4%), married (72%), urban residents (87.3%), and employed (58.8%). The majority of them also had a bachelor's degree or higher (58.8%). Significant positive correlations were observed between the preventive behaviors of COVID-19 and the perceived vulnerability (r = 0.192, P < 0.001), perceived severity (r = 0.092, P < 0.001), response efficacy (r = 0.398, P < 0.001), self-efficacy (r = 0.497, P < 0.001), and protection motivation (r = 0.595, P < 0.001). On the other hand, significant negative correlations were found between the preventive behaviors of COVID-19 and maladaptive behavior rewards (r = - 0.243, P < 0.001) and perceived costs (r = - 0.121, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The present findings showed that maladaptive behavior reward and fear negatively predicted the protective behaviors. On the other hand, response efficacy and self-efficacy positively predicted the protective behaviors; the impact of self-efficacy was the strongest. Overall, the information provided in this study can contribute to health policymaking in Iran.","Ezati Rad, Roghayeh; Mohseni, Shokrollah; Kamalzadeh Takhti, Hesamaddin; Hassani Azad, Mehdi; Shahabi, Nahid; Aghamolaei, Teamur; Norozian, Fatemeh",BMC Public Health,,269

231245,In The News,2020,"The rampant phenomenon of overpopulation and the remarkable increase of human movements over the last decade have caused an aggressive re-emergence of dengue fever, which made it the subject of several research fields. In this regard, mathematical modeling, and notably through compartmental systems, is considered as an eminent tool to obtain a clear overview of this disease's prevalence behavior. In reality, and like all epidemics, the dengue spread phenomenon is often subject to some randomness due to the different natural environment fluctuations. For this reason, a mathematical formulation that considers suitably as much as possible the external stochasticity is indeed required. By this token, we strive in this work to present and analyze a generalized stochastic dengue model that incorporates both slight and huge environmental perturbations. More precisely, our proposed model is represented under the form of an It\^o-L\'evy stochastic differential equations system that we demonstrate its mathematical well-posedness and biological significance. Based on some novel analytical techniques, we prove, and under appropriate hypothetical frameworks, of course, two important asymptotic properties, namely: extinction and persistence in the mean. The theoretical findings show that the dynamics of our disturbed dengue model are mainly determined by the parameters that are narrowly related to the small perturbations' intensities and the jumps magnitudes. In the end, we give certain numerical illustrative examples to support our theoretical findings and to highlight the effect of the adopted mathematical techniques on the results.","Kiouach, Driss; El-idrissi, Salim El Azami; Sabbar, Yassine",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.09424v1.pdf,269

The widespread use of macrolides is increasing resistance rates to these antibiotics. Molecular tools can help in diagnosis, typing and resistance detection, leading to better patient management. OBJECTIVES: To assess the MP genotypes and resistance pattern circulating in our area while comparing serological and molecular diagnosis of MP. METHODS: Molecular and serological diagnosis of MP was performed in 821 samples collected in Badalona (Barcelona, Spain) from 2013 to 2017. Multiple locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) and macrolide resistance detection by pyrosequencing were performed in those cases positive by PCR. Presence of respiratory viruses and relevant clinical data were also recorded. RESULTS: MP was detected in 16.8% of cases by PCR, with an overall agreement with serology of 76%. Eleven different MLVA types were identified, with 4-5-7-2 (50.1%) and 3-5-6-2 (29.2%) being the most abundant, with the latter showing a seasonal increase during the study. A total of 8% of the strains harboured a point substitution associated with macrolide resistance, corresponding mainly to an A2063G 23S rRNA mutation and directly related to previous macrolide therapy. Analysis of respiratory viruses showed viral coinfections in most cases. CONCLUSIONS: Serological and molecular tools combined could improve MP diagnosis and the analysis of its infection patterns. Macrolide resistance is associated with previous therapy. Given that MP pneumonia usually resolves spontaneously, it should be reconsidered whether antibiotic treatment is suitable for all cases.","Rivaya, Belén; Jordana-Lluch, Elena; Fernández-Rivas, Gema; Molinos, Sònia; Campos, Roi; Méndez-Hernández, María; Matas, Lurdes",J. antimicrob. chemother,,269

People's high sensitivity to the epidemic information leads to their risk aversion behavior and the spread of the epidemic is suppressed. In the population with only global person-to-person movement, timely and accurate epidemic information helps an individual cut off the connections with the infected in time and the epidemic is brought under control in no time. A delay in the epidemic information leads to an individual's misjudgment of who has been infected and who has not, which in turn leads to rapid progress and a higher peak of the epidemic. In the population with coexistence of local and global movement, timely and accurate epidemic information and people's high sensitivity to the epidemic information play an important role in curbing the epidemic. A theoretical analysis indicates that people's misjudgment caused by the delayed epidemic information leads to a higher encounter probability between the susceptible and the infected and people's self-restricted travel behavior helps reduce such an encounter probability. A functional relation between the ratio of infected individuals and the susceptible-infected encounter probability has been found.","Xu, Wen-Juan; Zhong, Chen-Yang; Ye, Hui-Fen; Chen, Rong-Da; Qiu, Tian; Ren, Fei; Zhong, Li-Xin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05327v2.pdf,269

Current best practices for personal protective equipment (PPE) during this time are rapidly evolving and fluid due to the novel and acute nature of the pandemic and the dearth of high-level evidence. Routine infection control practices augmented by airborne precautions are paramount when treating the COVID-19-positive patient. Best practices for PPE use in patients who have unknown COVID-19 status are a highly charged and emotional issue. The variables to be considered include protection of patients and healthcare providers, accuracy and availability of testing, and responsible use of PPE resources.

However, the difference in the sociocultural contexts between countries requires the specific adjustment of these estimates to each scenario. This article analyses the main elements used for the construction of models from epidemiological patterns, to describe the interaction, explain the dynamics of infection and recovery, and to predict possible scenarios that may arise with the introduction of public health measures such as social distancing and quarantines, specifically in the case of the pandemic unleashed by the new SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 virus. Comment: Mathematical models are highly relevant for making objective and effective decisions to control and eradicate the disease. These models used for COVID-19 have supported and will continue to provide information for the selection and implementation of programs and public policies that prevent associated complications, reduce the speed of the virus spread and minimize the occurrence of severe cases of the disease that may collapse health systems.","Grillo Ardila, Elvia Karina; Santaella-Tenorio, Julián; Guerrero, Rodrigo; Bravo, Luis Eduardo",Colomb Med (Cali),,269

The actual well-being of women IT employees is in danger due to the prolonged period of work from home as the pandemic has influenced individuals differently across the world. Physical distancing, dread, vulnerability, and a continued period of remote working has prompted an enormous number of women in the IT sector to experience challenges to emotional well-being. Work-related pressure is one of the major sources of stress in the modern working environment. Stress and unfavorable working conditions have been connected to low efficiency, truancy, and increasing rates of mishaps in and out of work. This is largely due to ailments, substance abuse, and family issues experienced by a large number of work-from-home women software company employees. Extended period of work from home can disturb women and their mental health as they try to strike a work-life balance. The purpose of this research is to examine the impact of occupational stress factors on the mental health of the women software professionals working remotely in urban Bangalore during the COVID-19 pandemic. The exploratory factor analysis identifies that Workload, Job Insecurity, Poor Work Environment, Personal Problems, and Lack of Structure as the main five factors of occupational stress while working from home for women IT employees in urban Bangalore. Multiple regression analysis undertaken in the study indicates that the relationship between the five factors of Occupational Stress and Mental Health is negatively significant with an inverse relationship.","Subha, B.; Madhusudhanan, R.; Thomas, Ajai Abraham",Journal of International Women&#039;s Studies,,269

In the United States, ""stay-at-home"" orders have led to loss of social routines and the closing of restaurants and bars; as a result, sales of alcohol have increased. The aim of this study was to assess changes in alcohol use patterns as a result of social distancing measures. METHODS: A single online survey was sent to a convenience sample of adults through social media. Self-reported demographics and alcohol use patterns before and during social distancing were obtained. RESULTS: Four hundred seventeen subjects completed the survey; 83% were women, 77% were married, 44% were between ages 35 and 44 years. Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) scores increased from median value of 3 to 4 (P < 0.0001); the increase was statistically significant only in women (P < 0.0001). Fewer people use alcohol during social distancing; however, in those who use alcohol, the frequency and quantity ingested increased, as well as the frequency of alcohol use prior to 5 pm. Despite these increases, there was an overall reduction in binge drinking pattern. Multivariate analysis identified women, having children at home, and a history of substance abuse to be associated with increase in alcohol use. CONCLUSION: Among those who continue to drink alcohol, social distancing has led to a significant increase in the amount of alcohol ingested, frequency of alcohol use, and an increase in AUDIT-C scores in women suggesting hazardous alcohol use behaviors. Clinicians should continue to assess patient alcohol use during the pandemic. Further studies will be needed to assess long-term outcomes after the COVID-19 pandemic resolves.","Boschuetz, Nicole; Cheng, Shanna; Mei, Ling; Loy, Veronica M",WMJ,,269

Women are more likely to manifest abnormal bleeding symptoms due to physiologic events and menorrhagia is the most common presenting symptom. Methods: this case-control study included 168 women aged between 18 and 45. The cases had menorrhagia whilst the controls did not. Blood grouping, activated partial thromboplastin time and von Willebrand factor activity tests were performed on samples collected from consenting study participants. Results: the mean age was 29.96 ± 7.37. Mean vWF activity of cases was 66.6% and of controls 97.8%. The mean activated Partial ThromboplastinTime (aPTT) of cases was 31.09s and of controls was 30.40s. There was no difference in the vWF activity between blood group O (86.3%) and non-blood group O (88.0%) participants. Eight women were diagnosed with von Willebrand disease, 6 cases and 2 controls. Higher odds of von Willebrand disease were seen in the cases (OR = 6.6). Epistaxis, von Willebrand and factor activity levels and family history of menorrhagia were associated with an increased risk for menorrhagia. Conclusion: von Willebrand factor activity levels were associated with menorrhagia while activated partial thromboplastin time was not. vWF activity levels did not depend on any specific blood group. The prevalence of von Willebrand disease was significantly higher in participants with menorrhagia and repeated epistaxis and family history of menorrhagia pointed to a higher risk of menorrhagia.","Munsanje, Miyoba Melinda; Kaile, Trevor; Kowa, Sumbukeni; Sinkala, Musalula; Simakando, Marah; Ndhlovu, Jacob; Chiluba, Brian Chanda",Pan Afr Med J,,269

253542,"Viel bejubelt, aber nicht unproblematisch",2020,"Background. One of the most rare but deadly types of infectious fungal infection is Mucormycosis. All the cases reported with this type of infection are immunocompromised individuals. The challenge of early detection and intervention makes it one of the high mortality rates among other infectious diseases. Case Report. We report an 18-month-old girl with undiagnosed diabetes presented with a very aggressive form of necrotic infection of the ear auricle with facial nerve palsy. Using a series of magnetic resonance imaging, antibiotics, and high clinical suspicion, a diagnosis was established, and the patient was sent to the operation theatre for surgical debridement. Monthly follow-ups showed improvement of the facial palsy, and a plan for artificial auricle is set to occur in the following months before the age of five. Discussion. Mucormycosis is considered a very fatal and aggressive infection that has a very high mortality rate in immunocompromised patients. Early detection of such cases with an array of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) is crucial in early treatment. Early aggressive surgical debridement and empirical coverage of bacterial, viral, and fungal infections can also alleviate the chances of preventing any secondary infection to develop in such cases. Conclusion. A combination of antifungal, antibiotic, and antiviral with timely surgical intervention improved the patient with complete resolution of the facial nerve palsy and no further recurrence of the infection.","Aljehani, Mariam Alahmadi Hatem Mansour Alshamani",Case Reports in Otolaryngology,,269

Inflammation of the lungs is the main factor leading to respiratory distress in patients with chronic respiratory disease and in patients with severe COVID-19. Several studies have shown that inflammation of the lungs in general and Type 2 diabetes are accompanied by the degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), especially heparan sulfate (HS). Several studies have also shown the importance of countering the degradation of HS in lung infections and Type 2 diabetes. D-xylose, which is the initiating element for different sulfate GAG chains (especially HS), has shown regeneration properties for GAGs. D-xylose and xylitol have demonstrated anti-inflammatory, antiglycemic, antiviral, and antibacterial properties in lung infections, alone or in combination with antibiotics. Considering the existing research on COVID-19 and related to D-xylose/xylitol, this review offers a perspective on why the association between D-xylose and antibiotics may contribute to significantly reducing the duration of treatment of COVID-19 patients and why some anti-inflammatory drugs may increase the severity of COVID-19. A strong correlation with scurvy, based on gender, age, ethnicity, smoking status, and obesity status, is also reviewed. Related to this, the effects of treatment with plants such as Artemisia are also addressed.

264353,VentMon: An Open Source Inline Ventilator Tester and Monitor,2021,"Significant aspects of COVID-19 pandemic remain obscure. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a component of the renin-angiotensin system, whose expression dominates on lung alveolar epithelial cells, is the human cell receptor of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. We strongly encourage the concept that thorough considerations of receptor-ligand interactions should be kept at the heart of scientific debate on infection. In this idea, the whole renin-angiotensin system has to be evaluated. We hypothesize that factors related to ethnicity, environment, behaviors, associated illness, and medications involving this complex system are probably responsible for situations regarded as anomalous from both an epidemiological and a clinical point of view, but, taken together, such factors may explain most of the aspects of current outbreak. We decided to use the analogy of a play and speculate about the possible impact in this tragedy of 1) air pollution via the interference of nitrogen dioxide on ACE2 expression; 2) the dual role of nicotine; 3) the hypothetical involvement of ACE2 polymorphisms, the relationships of which with ethnic factors and susceptibility to cardiovascular disease seems intriguing; 4) the impact on the severity of infection of hypertension and related medications acting on the renin/angiotensin system, and, finally, 5) the possible helpful role of chloroquine, thanks to its capacity of modifying ACE2 affinity to the viral spike protein by altering glycosylation.

Objectives: To assess immediate and long-term effects of the pandemic on dermatology practice on a large scale, including the clinical activity of participant, frequency and types of procedures used, and teledermatology (TD) use. Methods: This web-based, global survey included 733 dermatologists. Primary outcomes are percentages of responders providing in-person consultations, hospital service, and TD, and doing procedures. Also, factors in logistic regression models that may influence the Odds Ratio (OR) for TD use during pandemic and for future use. Results: The percentages of responders providing in-person consultations (46.6% vs 100% before), and hospital service (27% vs 52.8% before), and doing procedures (25.6% vs 100% before) decreased while practicing TD increased three-fold (75.2% vs 26.1% before) during pandemic (P < .001 for each). Practice location was associated with TD use during the pandemic and with its expected use in the future (P < .001 for both), with North American responders indicating the highest use. TD use during the pandemic showed a positive correlation with TD use before, performing procedures and, more specifically, with biopsies of suspicious pigmented lesions during pandemic (P < .001 for each). TD use before pandemic was the most powerful predictor of TD use during pandemic (OR, 16.47 [95% CI, 7.12-38.06]). More than two thirds (68.6%) of participants expect to use TD in the future. The factor with the largest increase in OR on the expectation of future TD use was >1,000 COVID-19 cases in the country (OR, 3.80 [95% CI, 2.33-6.21]).

The current treatments for HCC suffer from drug resistance and poor prognosis; therefore, novel therapeutic agents are urgently needed. Phytochemicals have been proposed to treat a range of cancers. Among them, &#945;-lipoic acid (&#945;-LA), a naturally synthesized antioxidant found in various dietary animal and plant sources, prevents oxidant-mediated cell death in normal cells while inducing apoptosis in several cancer cell lines. Previously, we demonstrated that the treatment of hepatoma cells with &#945;-LA induced apoptosis, which was preceded by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of the p53 protein, a known inducer of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Several studies have shown that ROS-induced apoptosis is associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) activation. Herein, we investigated if &#945;-LA-induced apoptosis in hepatoma cell lines was ER stress- and UPR-mediated by gene expression profiling analyses. UPR and ER stress pathways were the most up-regulated after treatment with &#945;-LA. This finding, which has been confirmed by expression analyses of ER- and UPR-associated proteins, provides a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the anti-tumoral action of &#945;-LA on hepatoma cells.","Pibiri, Monica; Sulas, Pia; Camboni, Tania; Leoni, Vera Piera; Simbula, Gabriella",Sci Rep,,269

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using the Premier Healthcare Database Special COVID-19 Release records of patients discharged after COVID-19 hospitalization from U.S. hospitals from March to November 2020 (N = 269,674 after exclusion), we estimated risk differences (RD) and risk ratios (RR) of intensive care unit admission or invasive mechanical ventilation (ICU/MV) and of death among patients with T1DM compared with patients without diabetes or with T2DM. Logistic models were adjusted for age, sex, and race or ethnicity. Models adjusted for additional demographic and clinical characteristics were used to examine whether other factors account for the associations between T1DM and severe COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS: Compared with patients without diabetes, T1DM was associated with a 21% higher absolute risk of ICU/MV (RD 0.21, 95% CI 0.19-0.24; RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.43-1.56) and a 5% higher absolute risk of mortality (RD 0.05, 95% CI 0.03-0.07; RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.24-1.57), with adjustment for age, sex, and race or ethnicity. Compared with T2DM, T1DM was associated with a 9% higher absolute risk of ICU/MV (RD 0.09, 95% CI 0.07-0.12; RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.12-1.22), but no difference in mortality (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.02; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.89-1.13).

CONCLUSIONS: Patients with T1DM hospitalized for COVID-19 are at higher risk for severe outcomes than those without diabetes. Higher risk of ICU/MV in patients with T1DM than in patients with T2DM was largely accounted for by the presence of DKA. These findings might further guide recommendations related to diabetes management and the prevention of COVID-19.","Barrett, Catherine E; Park, Joohyun; Kompaniyets, Lyudmyla; Baggs, James; Cheng, Yiling J; Zhang, Ping; Imperatore, Giuseppina; Pavkov, Meda E",Diabetes Care,,269

274868,Individualised Responsible Artificial Intelligence for Home-Based Rehabilitation,2020,"Physical distancing policy that is encouraged by the World Health Organization (WHO) has inspired consumers to do contactless activities, including payment transaction. Government authorities in a growing number of countries are taking actions to encourage contactless payments as the COVID-19 pandemic escalates. People are worried that novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov2) can be transmitted through physical money. It drives them to shift to e-wallet. Due to a lack of study on this topic, the present study contributes to the literature by examining the effect of perceived risk, government support, and perceived usefulness on customers’ intention to use e-wallet during COVID-19 outbreak. To give more fruitful insight, another major contribution of this study is investigating the group difference between Indonesia and Malaysia in the overall model. Questionnaires are distributed to the respondents by using a proportional sampling technique. As a result, 259 total respondents from Indonesia and 207 from Malaysia are collected. Both countries are selected because Indonesia and Malaysia can be considered as the two-worst countries in ASEAN affected by COVID-19. The model is tested using PLS-Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach. The results show that the effects of government support on the intention to use e-wallets differ between countries. Besides, perceived usefulness fully mediated government support-intention to use e-wallets relationship, and partially mediated the effect of perceived risk on intention to use e-wallets.","Aji, Hendy Mustiko; Berakon, Izra; Md Husin, Maizaitulaidawati",Cogent Bus.

277095,Automatic segmentation and applicator reconstruction for CT-based brachytherapy of cervical cancer using 3D convolutional neural networks,2020,"BACKGROUND: The mosquito Aedes albopictus is an important vector for many pathogens. Understanding the virome in Ae. albopictus is critical for assessing the risk of disease transmission, implementation of vector control measures, and health system strengthening. METHODS: In this study, viral metagenomic and PCR methods were used to reveal the virome in adult Ae. albopictus captured in different areas and during different seasons in Guangzhou, China. RESULTS: The viral composition of adult Ae. albopictus varied mainly between seasons. Over 50 viral families were found, which were specific to vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, fungi, bacteria, and protozoa. In rural areas, Siphoviridae (6.5%) was the most common viral family harbored by mosquitoes captured during winter and spring, while Luteoviridae (1.1%) was the most common viral family harbored by mosquitoes captured during summer and autumn. Myoviridae (7.0% and 1.3%) was the most common viral family in mosquitoes captured in urban areas during all seasons. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) was detected by PCR in a female mosquito pool. The first near full-length HBV genome from Ae. albopictus was amplified, which showed a high level of similarity with human HBV genotype B sequences. Human parechovirus (HPeV) was detected in male and female mosquito pools, and the sequences were clustered with HPeV 1 and 3 sequences. CONCLUSIONS: Large numbers of viral species were found in adult Ae. albopictus, including viruses from vertebrates, insects, and plants. The viral composition in Ae. albopictus mainly varied between seasons. Herein, we are the first to report the detection of HPeV and HBV in mosquitoes. This study not only provides valuable information for the control and prevention of mosquito-borne diseases, but it also demonstrates the feasibility of xenosurveillance.","He, Wenqiao; Chen, Yanxia; Zhang, Xiru; Peng, Mingji; Xu, Da; He, Huan; Gao, Yuhan; Chen, Junlin; Zhang, Jiarui; Li, Zhiyu; Chen, Qing",Parasit Vectors,,269
277498,Impact of loneliness on diurnal cortisol in youth,2021,"The Bluetooth sensor embedded in mobile phones provides an unobtrusive, continuous, and cost-efficient means to capture individuals' proximity information, such as the nearby Bluetooth devices count (NBDC). The continuous NBDC data can partially reflect individuals' behaviors and status, such as social connections and interactions, working status, mobility, and social isolation and loneliness, which were found to be significantly associated with depression by previous survey-based studies. This paper aims to explore the NBDC data's value in predicting depressive symptom severity as measured via the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8). The data used in this paper included 2,886 bi-weekly PHQ-8 records collected from 316 participants recruited from three study sites in the Netherlands, Spain, and the UK as part of the EU RADAR-CNS study. From the NBDC data two weeks prior to each PHQ-8 score, we extracted 49 Bluetooth features, including statistical features and nonlinear features for measuring periodicity and regularity of individuals' life rhythms. Linear mixed-effect models were used to explore associations between Bluetooth features and the PHQ-8 score. We then applied hierarchical Bayesian linear regression models to predict the PHQ-8 score from the extracted Bluetooth features. A number of significant associations were found between Bluetooth features and depressive symptom severity. Compared with commonly used machine learning models, the proposed hierarchical Bayesian linear regression model achieved the best prediction metrics, R2= 0.526, and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 3.891. Bluetooth features can explain an extra 18.8% of the variance in the PHQ-8 score relative to the baseline model without Bluetooth features (R2=0.338, RMSE = 4.547).","Zhang, Yuezhou; Folarin, Amos A; Sun, Shaoxiong; Cummins, Nicholas; Ranjan, Yatharth; Rashid, Zulqarnain; Conde, Pauline; Stewart, Callum; Laiou, Petroula; Matcham, Faith; Oetzmann, Carolin; Lamers, Femke; Siddi, Sara; Simblett, Sara; Rintala, Aki; Mohr, David C; Myin-Germeys, Inez; Wykes, Til; Haro, Josep Maria; Pennix, Brenda WJH; Narayan, Vaibhav A; Annas, Peter; Hotopf, Matthew; Dobson, Richard JB",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12407v1.pdf,269
283355,Proper scoring rules for evaluating asymmetry in density forecasting,2020-06-19,"BACKGROUND: Blebs are rupture risk factors in intracranial aneurysms (IAs), but their prevalence, distribution, and associations with clinical factors as well as their causes and effects on aneurysm vulnerability remain unclear. METHODS: A total of 122 blebs in 270 IAs selected for surgery were studied using patient-specific vascular reconstructions from 3D angiographic images. Bleb geometry, location on the aneurysm, and frequency of occurrence in aneurysms at different locations were analyzed. Associations between gender, age, smoking, hypertension, hormone therapy, dental infection, and presence of blebs were investigated. RESULTS: Of all aneurysms with blebs, 77% had a single bleb and 23% had multiple blebs. Only 6% of blebs were at the neck, while 46% were in the body and 48% in the dome. Aneurysms with blebs were larger (p<0.0001), more elongated (p=0.0002), and with wider necks than aneurysms without blebs. Bleb presence was associated with dental infection (p=0.0426) and negatively associated with hormone therapy (p=0.0426) in women. Anterior and posterior communicating arteries had larger percentages of aneurysms with blebs than internal carotid arteries. Patients with a history of hypertension tended to have a larger percentage of aneurysms with blebs. However, these trends did not reach significance in this sample. CONCLUSIONS: Blebs are common in IAs, and most aneurysms harboring blebs have a single bleb. Blebs in the aneurysm neck are rare, but they are equally common in the body and dome. The presence of blebs in IAs was associated with dental infection, and negatively associated with hormone replacement therapy.","Salimi Ashkezari, Seyedeh Fatemeh; Detmer, Felicitas J; Mut, Fernando; Chung, Bong Jae; Yu, Alexander K; Stapleton, Christopher J; See, Alfred P; Amin-Hanjani, Sepideh; Charbel, Fady T; Rezai Jahromi, Behnam; Niemelä, Mika; Frösen, Juhana; Zhou, Ji; Maiti, Spandan; Robertson, Anne M; Cebral, Juan R",J. neurointerv. surg.

Our objective was to identify early prognostic factors upon admission to optimize the management of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a medical ward. This French single-center prospective cohort study evaluated 152 patients with positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay, hospitalized in the Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology Department, at Pitié-Salpêtrière's Hospital, in Paris, France, a tertiary care university hospital. Predictive factors of intensive care unit (ICU) transfer or death at day 14 (D14), of being discharge alive and severe status at D14 (remaining with ventilation, or death) were evaluated in multivariable logistic regression models; models' performances, including discrimination and calibration, were assessed (C-index, calibration curve, R2, Brier score). A validation was performed on an external sample of 132 patients hospitalized in a French hospital close to Paris, in Aulnay-sous-Bois, Île-de-France. The probability of ICU transfer or death was 32% (47/147) (95% CI 25-40). Older age (OR 2.61, 95% CI 0.96-7.10), poorer respiratory presentation (OR 4.04 per 1-point increment on World Health Organization (WHO) clinical scale, 95% CI 1.76-9.25), higher CRP-level (OR 1.63 per 100mg/L increment, 95% CI 0.98-2.71) and lower lymphocytes count (OR 0.36 per 1000/mm3 increment, 95% CI 0.13-0.99) were associated with an increased risk of ICU requirement or death. A 9-point ordinal scale scoring system defined low (score 0-2), moderate (score 3-5), and high (score 6-8) risk patients, with predicted respectively 2%, 25% and 81% risk of ICU transfer or death at D14. Therefore, in this prospective cohort study of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a medical ward in France, a simplified scoring system at admission predicted the outcome at D14.","Allenbach, Yves; Saadoun, David; Maalouf, Georgina; Vieira, Matheus; Hellio, Alexandra; Boddaert, Jacques; Gros, Hélène; Salem, Joe Elie; Resche Rigon, Matthieu; Menyssa, Cherifa; Biard, Lucie; Benveniste, Olivier; Cacoub, Patrice",PLoS One,,269

Type of program or service: We present a case study of a participatory research collaboration between CALD community leaders and health behaviour change scientists during the COVID-19 crisis. The goal was to better understand the role of community leaders in shaping health behaviours in their communities and how that role might be leveraged for better health outcomes. METHODS: This article is the culmination of a series of dialogues between CALD community and advocacy leaders, and health behaviour change scientists in July 2020. The academic authors recruited 12 prominent CALD community leaders, conducted five semi-structured dialogues with small groups, and worked with all participants to develop insights that were applicable to the many different CALD communities represented in the research collaboration. RESULTS: Three key findings emerged: 1) partnerships between CALD leaders, communities and government are critical for effective health communication; 2) shifting behaviour requires moving beyond disseminating information to designing tailored solutions; and 3) the diverse needs and circumstances of people and communities must be at the centre of health communication and behaviour change strategies. LESSONS LEARNT: The collaborative process we undertook in this study enabled us to identify key challenges experienced and solutions offered by CALD leaders in communicating health information throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Partnering with communities that are subject to health messaging can reduce inequalities in healthcare communication by enabling the development of strategies that help align human behaviour with the recommendations of health experts. This - along with sustained partnership and collaboration with CALD communities, understanding the cultural context, and the appropriate tailoring and delivery of communications - will ensure health-related messages are not lost in translation. The lessons provided in this paper are applicable not only to the current pandemic but also to post-pandemic social and economic recovery.","Wild, Abigail; Kunstler, Breanne; Goodwin, Denise; Onyala, Saturnino; Zhang, Li; Kufi, Marama; Salim, Wudad; Musse, Faduma; Mohideen, Mohamed; Asthana, Molina; Al-Khafaji, Mohammad; Geronimo, Mary Ann; Coase, Daniel; Chew, Erin; Micallef, Eddie; Skouteris, Helen",Public Health Res.

METHODS: The COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study is a longitudinal, nationally representative, online survey of UK adults. The current study analysed data from its first three waves of data collection: Wave 1 (March 2020, N = 2025), Wave 2 (April 2020, N = 1406) and Wave 3 (July 2020, N = 1166). Anxiety-depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale (a composite measure of the PHQ-9 and GAD-7) and COVID-19-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with the International Trauma Questionnaire. Changes in mental health outcomes were modelled across the three waves. Latent class growth analysis was used to identify subgroups of individuals with different trajectories of change in anxiety-depression and COVID-19 PTSD. Latent class membership was regressed on baseline characteristics. RESULTS: Overall prevalence of anxiety-depression remained stable, while COVID-19 PTSD reduced between Waves 2 and 3. Heterogeneity in mental health response was found, and hypothesised classes reflecting (i) stability, (ii) improvement and (iii) deterioration in mental health were identified. Psychological factors were most likely to differentiate the improving, deteriorating and high-stable classes from the low-stable mental health trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: A low-stable profile characterised by little-to-no psychological distress ('resilient' class) was the most common trajectory for both anxiety-depression and COVID-19 PTSD. Monitoring these trajectories is necessary moving forward, in particular for the ~30% of individuals with increasing anxiety-depression levels.","Shevlin, Mark; Butter, Sarah; McBride, Orla; Murphy, Jamie; Gibson-Miller, Jilly; Hartman, Todd K; Levita, Liat; Mason, Liam; Martinez, Anton P; McKay, Ryan; Stocks, Thomas V A; Bennett, Kate; Hyland, Philip; Bentall, Richard P",Psychol Med,,269

METHODS: In this multicentric retrospective study, a total of 382 adult patients (?18 years of age) with confirmed COVID?19 who were hospitalized for treatment were enrolled. The patients were divided into two groups according to the periods during which they used PPIs: the first group included patients who were not on PPI treatment, and the second group included those who have used PPIs for more than 4 weeks. RESULTS: The study participants were grouped according to their PPI usage history over the last 6 months. In total, 291 patients did not use any type of PPI over the last 6 months, and 91 patients used PPIs for more than 4 weeks.

Here, we have identified CddA (cyanobacterial deacetylase/depropionylase), a lysine deacylase enzyme expressed in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 that has both deacetylase and depropionylase activity. Loss of the gene cddA led to slower growth and impaired linear and cyclic photosynthetic electron transfer. We determined the crystal structure of this depropionylase/deacetylase at 2.1 Å resolution and established that it has a unique and characteristically folded &#945;/ß structure. We detected an acyl binding site within CddA via site-directed mutagenesis and demonstrated that this site is essential for the deproprionylase activity of this enzyme. Through a proteomic approach, we identified a total of 598 lysine residues across 382 proteins that were capable of undergoing propionylation. These propionylated proteins were highly enriched for photosynthetic and metabolic functionality. We additionally demonstrated that CddA was capable of catalyzing in vivo and in vitro lysine depropionylation and deacetylation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (F/SBPase), thereby regulating its enzymatic activity. Our identification of a lysine deacylase provides insight into the mechanisms globally regulating photosynthesis and carbon metabolism in cyanobacteria and potentially in other photosynthetic organisms as well.","Liu, Xin; Yang, Mingkun; Liu, Yingfang; Ge, Feng; Zhao, Jindong",Plant physiol,,269

O processo visa eliminar. Os parâmetros de tempo e temperatura empregados no mundo foram definidos após estudos sobre a resistência térmica do Mycobacterium tuberculosis e da Coxiella burnetti, reconhecidos como os microrganismos patogênicos, não formadores de esporos e que eventualmente podem estar presentes no leite cru, que apresentam a maior resistência térmica. Entretanto, não há estudos sobre a resistência térmica do M. bovis que circula nos bovinos no Brasil. Este estudo propôs-se a avaliar a resistência térmica (75ºC) de cinco espoligotipos de M. bovis, isolados de bovinos abatidos no estado de São Paulo, em leite integral experimentalmente contaminado. Leite UHT foi contaminado com M. bovis e, então, submetido a tratamento térmico em banho-maria a 75ºC por 20 segundos. Cada espoligotipo foi testado 3 vezes. As amostras foram retiradas do banho nos tempos 0 (o momento em que o leite atingiu 75ºC), 5, 10, 15 e 20, correspondendo ao tempo, em segundos, de tratamento térmico. O leite contaminado também foi analisado, para quantificação da carga inicial. O controle do processo envolveu o acompanhamento da temperatura do leite (um tubo com termômetro) e análise das enzimas fosfatase alcalina e peroxidase ao final do tratamento; para tal, amostras de leite cru foram tratadas juntamente com as amostras-teste. Para quantificação, foi realizada a diluição decimal seriada seguida da semeadura em duplicata em meio Stonebrink-Leslie (37ºC/45dias). Os resultados mostraram que foi na fase de aquecimento que ocorreu a maior taxa de morte de todos os espoligotipos. Houve diferença de resistência entre os espoligotipos ao processo que simulou a pasteurização rápida e o espoligotipo BR024 foi o mais resistente. Conclui-se que houve diferença da eficácia da pasteurização, de acordo com o espoligotipo testado, mas que os resultados precisam ser investigados mais detalhadamente","Ribeiro, Leandro",,,269

This study aimed at investigating the response of SP/hrpZPsph-expressing plants under cadmium stress. Transgenic N. benthamiana lines, homozygous for the SP/hrpZPsph gene, and wild-type plants were exposed to Cd at different stress levels (0, 50, 100, 150 µ&#924; CdCl2). Plants' response to stress was assessed at germination and at the whole plant level on the basis of physiological and growth parameters, including seed germination percentage, shoot and root length, total chlorophyll content, fresh and dry root weight, as well as overall symptomatology, and Cd content in leaves and roots. At germination phase, significant differences were noted in germination rates and post-germination growth among stress levels, with Cd effects being in most cases analogous to the level applied but also among plant categories. Although seedling growth was adversely affected in all plant categories, especially at high stress level, lines #6 and #9 showed the lowest decrease in root and shoot length over control. The superiority of these lines was further manifested at the whole plant level by the absence of stress-attributed symptoms and the low or zero reduction in chlorophyll content. Interestingly, a differential tissue-specific Cd accumulation pattern was observed in wt- and hrpZPsph-plants, with the former showing an increased Cd content in leaves and the latter retaining Cd in the roots. These data are discussed in the context of possible mechanisms underlying the hrpZPsph-based Cd stress resistance.","Mitsopoulou, Nikoletta; Lakiotis, Kosmas; Golia, Evangelia E; Khah, Ebrahim M; Pavli, Ourania I",,,269

324491,Micro-Fabricated RTD Based Sensor for Breathing Analysis and Monitoring,2021,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, decreasing rates of hospitalisations for cardiovascular disease raised concerns for undertreatment, particularly for vulnerable groups. We investigated how the initial COVID-19 public lockdown, impacted the risk of being hospitalised with a major cardiovascular event (MCE: myocardial infarction/stroke/heart failure) according to educational level. METHODS: We grouped all Danish residents according to educational attainment level (low, medium, high) and age (40-59, 60-69, &#8805;70 years). In each group, we calculated the age-standardised and sex standardised risk of MCE hospitalisation in the initial COVID-19 lockdown-period (13 March 2020-3 May 2020) and in the corresponding calendar period in 2019. We calculated age-standardised and sex-standardised risks to investigate whether the COVID-19 lockdown had a differential effect on MCE incidence according to educational level. RESULTS: In the period in 2019, 2700 Danish residents were hospitalised with MCE, compared with only 2290 during the lockdown. During lockdown, the risk of hospitalisation for MCE decreased among residents aged &#8805;70 with low education (risk difference (RD) -46.2 (-73.2; -19.2) per 100,000) or medium education (RD -23.2 (-50.8; 4.3) per 100 000), but not among residents with high education (RD 5.1 (-32.3; 42.5), per 100 000). The risk of hospitalisation for MCE did not decrease significantly for the younger age groups. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 lockdown is associated with a reduced incidence for MCE, especially among low educated, elderly residents. This raises concern for undertreatment that without clinical awareness and action may widen the educational gap in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.","Andersen, Julie; Strandberg-Larsen, Katrine; Gerds, Thomas; Gislason, Gunnar; Torp-Pedersen, Christian; Blanche, Paul; Andersson, Charlotte; Køber, Lars; Fosbøl, Emil; Phelps, Matthew; Kragholm, Kristian; Andersen, Mikkel Porsborg; Østergaard, Lauge; Butt, Jawad Haider; Schou, Morten",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),,269

We analysed COVID-19 cases in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) with attention to socio-demographic factors. Study design A retrospective chart review of laboratory confirmedCOVID-19 cases was conducted between March and September 2020. Methods Demographic data such as age, gender, place of residence, pregnancy, and symptoms were analysed. Patients were divided into two outcome groups: discharged from quarantine restrictions and dead. Results A total of 15,338 confirmed cases was examined.COVID-19 cases tended to be young (48.2% were less than 30 years of age) with an average age of 34.3±27.3, mostwere female (55.5%),and20% smoked. Overall, 5,183 (38%) were symptomatic and if pregnant, symptoms were more commonly reported (65.3%).The overall case-fatality was 0.93 [95% CI 0.83-1.04]. Males had a greater risk of death (OR=2.7 [95%CI=1.7-2.8], P&lt;0.001), as did those 60 years of age and older (OR=52.0 [30.5-89.7], P&lt;0.001). Conclusion Early detection of socio-demographic risk factors helps understand the case distribution and guide better planning, especially in countries with limited resources. Better targeting of interventions may help to limit more expensive interventions such as intensive care admissions and avoid deaths. Such data are also important for planning vaccination campaigns.","Maraqa, Beesan Al-Shakhra Kamal Alawneh Moath Jallad Rania Alkaileh Mai",Public Health in Practice,,269

The number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise which is a global burden on the health care system worldwide. Efforts are continuing to come up with a solution either to develop a small molecular inhibitor or vaccine, but still no success. In the fight against SARS-CoV-2, targeting a different protein of the SARS-CoV-2 is the need of the hour to impede and relinquish the current pandemic. Therefore, in this study, computational modelling and simulation approaches are used to target the N-terminal domain of the phosphor-nucleoprotein (RNA binding protein), which is primarily responsible for binding and packing the viral genome to get ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP). Our multi-step drug screening approach shortlisted potential drugs. These top hits were confirmed by re-docking which revealed that the interacting molecules block the key residues i.e. Thr57, His59, Ser105, Arg107, and Arg177 and thus ultimately block the NTD from RNA recognition. Furthermore, the activity of the top four hits was also confirmed by using molecular dynamics simulation and free energy calculation. Our analysis suggests that these top hits possess strong inhibitory properties and should be tested experimentally. In conclusion, we hope these top hits would abrogate the binding of RNA and the NTD of the SARS-CoV-2, which might be helpful to combat COVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

A web-based 19-question survey was distributed to the people who attended the webinar series that was carried out by the Saudi Association of Neurological Surgery from March 29, 2020 to May 31, 2020. Candidates were identified through their registration e-mails. The survey was distributed June 5-8, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 156 responses were received (survey response rate: 60%). The overall satisfaction rate among residents and attendings (board-certified neurosurgeons) was similar (>80%). However, only 56.4% of attendings reported they were comfortable with online webinars compared with 81.2% of residents (P value <0.0001). Seventy-five percent of residents found online lectures more useful than traditional in-person lectures compared with 52% of attendings (P value = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Online educational webinars provide an educational value that can be considered as an adjunct to traditional (in-person) education methods.

336343,Investitionen für nachhaltiges Wachstum in Deutschland: Status quo und Perspektiven,2021,"We have applied mathematical modeling to investigate the infections of the ongoing coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. We first validated our model using the well-studied influenza viruses and then compared the pathogenesis processes between the two viruses. The interaction between host innate and adaptive immune responses was found to be a potential cause for the higher severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Specifically, the timing mismatch between the two immune responses has a major impact on disease progression. The adaptive immune response of the COVID-19 patients is more likely to come before the peak of viral load, while the opposite is true for influenza patients. This difference in timing causes delayed depletion of vulnerable epithelial cells in the lungs in COVID-19 patients while enhancing viral clearance in influenza patients. Stronger adaptive immunity in COVID-19 patients can potentially lead to longer recovery time and more severe secondary complications. Based on our analysis, delaying the onset of adaptive immune responses during the early phase of infections may be a potential treatment option for high-risk COVID-19 patients. Suppressing the adaptive immune response temporarily and avoiding its interference with the innate immune response may allow the innate immunity to more efficiently clear the virus.","Du, Sean Quan; Yuan, Weiming",J. med. virol,,269

Veno-venous Extra-Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (VV-ECMO) is an established therapy for management of patients demonstrating the most severe forms of hypoxemic respiratory failure from COVID-19. However, features of COVID-19 pathophysiology and necessary length of treatment present distinct challenges for utilization of VV-ECMO within the current healthcare emergency. In addition, growing allocation concerns due to capacity and cost present significant challenges. Ethical and legal aspects pertinent to triage of this resource-intensive, but potentially life-saving, therapy in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic are reviewed here. Given considerations relevant to VV-ECMO use, additional emphasis has been placed on emerging hospital resource scarcity and disproportionate representation of healthcare workers among the ill. Considerations are also discussed surrounding withdrawal of VV-ECMO and the role for early communication as well as consultation from palliative care teams and local ethics committees. In discussing how to best manage these issues in the COVID-19 pandemic at present, we identify gaps in the literature and policy important to clinicians as this crisis continues.","Murugappan, Kadhiresan R; Walsh, Daniel P; Mittel, Aaron; Sontag, David; Shaefi, Shahzad",J Crit Care,,269

As such, the study was intended to find out the association between students' inattentiveness to study and their psychological conditions during this pandemic. Primary data for this study were collected from a total of 157 samples chosen from the undergraduate students of 18 academic departments of the Noakhali Science and Technology University (NSTU), Bangladesh on the basis of snowball sampling. The study reveals that most of the respondents were much inattentive to study during the COVID-19 pandemic and they were much anxious, depressed, tensed, restless, bored and frightened, and thereby their mental health and well-being were affected. The study shows that there is a strong positive association between the students' inattentiveness to study and their psychological conditions which involve anxiety, depression, tension, restlessness, boredom and fear/panic. The study indicates that the association between the students' inattentiveness to study and their psychological conditions is statistically significant. Finally, the study suggests that the Government and the authority concerned should undertake proper measures to mitigate the adverse psychological conditions of the NSTU students by means of motivations and psychosocial counselling, and thereby keeping up their attentiveness to study during the pandemic or any other critical situation. As such, there is a crying need for establishing a psychosocial counselling centre or an educational counselling centre in all universities of Bangladesh including the NSTU.","Muniruzzaman, Md Siddiky Md Roknuzzaman",Asian Journal of University Education,,269

Improving upon conventional methods for analysing composite endpoints, the win ratio accounts for relative priorities of the components and allows the components to be different types of outcomes. For example, the win ratio can combine the time to death with the number of occurrences of a non-fatal outcome such as CV-related hospitalizations (CVHs) in a single hierarchical composite endpoint. The win ratio can provide greater statistical power to detect and quantify a treatment difference by using all available information contained in the component outcomes. The win ratio can also incorporate quantitative outcomes such as exercise tests or quality-of-life scores. There is a need for more practical guidance on how best to design trials using the win ratio approach. This manuscript provides an overview of the principles behind the win ratio and provides insights into how to implement the win ratio in CV trial design and reporting, including how to determine trial size.","Redfors, Björn; Gregson, John; Crowley, Aaron; McAndrew, Thomas; Ben-Yehuda, Ori; Stone, Gregg W; Pocock, Stuart J",Eur. heart j,,269

It is a challenge to implement timely and appropriate public health interventions. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Population and COVID-19 epidemiological data between 21st January 2020 to 15th November 2020 from 216 countries and territories were included with the implemented public health interventions. We used deep reinforcement learning, and the algorithm was trained to enable agents to try to find optimal public health strategies that maximized total reward on controlling the spread of COVID-19. The results suggested by the algorithm were analyzed against the actual timing and intensity of lockdown and travel restrictions. Early implementations of the actual lockdown and travel restriction policies, usually at the time of local index case were associated with less burden of COVID-19. In contrast, our agent suggested to initiate at least minimal intensity of lockdown or travel restriction even before or on the day of the index case in each country and territory. In addition, the agent mostly recommended a combination of lockdown and travel restrictions and higher intensity policies than the policies implemented by governments, but did not always encourage rapid full lockdown and full border closures. The limitation of this study was that it was done with incomplete data due to the emerging COVID-19 epidemic, inconsistent testing and reporting. In addition, our research focuses only on population health benefits by controlling the spread of COVID-19 without balancing the negative impacts of economic and social consequences. INTERPRETATION: Compared to actual government implementation, our algorithm mostly recommended earlier intensity of lockdown and travel restrictions. Reinforcement learning may be used as a decision support tool for implementation of public health interventions during COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Kwak, Gloria Hyunjung; Ling, Lowell; Hui, Pan",PLoS One,,269

We estimate a model with RE and LRR using long-term consumption data for 42 economies, identify these two types of risks simultaneously from the data, and reveal their distinctions. RE typically associates with major historical episodes, such as world wars and depressions and analogous country-specific events. LRR reflects gradual processes that influence long-run growth rates and volatility. A match between the model and observed average rates of return on equity and short-term bonds requires a coefficient of relative risk aversion, Î³, around 6. Most of the explanation for the equity premium derives from RE, although LRR makes a moderate contribution. However, LRR helps in fitting the Sharpe ratio. Generating good matches to the equity premium and Sharpe ratio simultaneously is still challenging.","Barro, Robert J; Jin, Tao",Review of economic dynamics,,269

By employing the panel univariate LM unit root test, panel cointegration tests with multiple structural breaks, and FMOLS estimations as well as the panel vector error correction model (VECM), we find that a bi-directional relationship among variables exists in the full sample. More importantly, from a long-term perspective we also note that the impact of epidemics on atmospheric quality is negative. Therefore, we hypothesize that this may be related to the retaliatory emissions of companies after epidemics and poor government supervision. For a more in-depth investigation, we take CO2 emissions of the industrial and transportation sectors as the proxy variables and see that the more developed an economy is, the greater is the cointegration between epidemics and atmospheric quality. Our research offers implications for policy makers, such that improving atmospheric quality is an important way to prevent epidemics, and in order to alleviate and eliminate the spread of epidemics governments should pay more attention to environmental control.","Wang, Y.

In this paper, the impact of sudden suspension of human activities on air pollution was analyzed by studying the change in satellite retrieved NO2 concentrations and top-down NOx emission over the urban and rural areas around Delhi. NO2 was chosen for being the most indicative of emission intensity due to its short lifetime of the order of a few hours in the planetary boundary layer. We present a robust temporal comparison of Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) retrieved NO2 column density during the lockdown with the counterfactual baseline concentrations, extrapolated from the long-term trend and seasonal cycle components of NO2 using observations during 2015 to 2019. NO2 concentration in the urban area of Delhi experienced an anomalous relative change ranging from 60.0% decline during the Phase 1 of lockdown (March 25-April 13, 2020) to 3.4% during the post-lockdown Phase 5. In contrast, we find no substantial reduction in NO2 concentrations over the rural areas. To segregate the impact of the lockdown from the meteorology, weekly top-down NOx emissions were estimated from high-resolution TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) retrieved NO2 by accounting for horizontal advection derived from the steady state continuity equation. NOx emissions from urban Delhi and power plants exhibited a mean decline of 72.2% and 53.4% respectively in Phase 1 compared to the pre-lockdown business-as-usual phase. Emission estimates over urban areas and power-plants showed a good correlation with activity reports, suggesting the applicability of this approach for studying emission changes. A higher anomaly in emission estimates suggests that comparison of only concentration change, without accounting for the dynamical and photochemical conditions, may mislead evaluation of lockdown impact. Our results shall also have a broader impact for optimizing bottom-up emission inventories.","Misra, Prakhar; Takigawa, Masayuki; Khatri, Pradeep; Dhaka, Surendra K; Dimri, A P; Yamaji, Kazuyo; Kajino, Mizuo; Takeuchi, Wataru; Imasu, Ryoichi; Nitta, Kaho; Patra, Prabir K; Hayashida, Sachiko",Sci Rep,,269

377348,GKD revenues reach all-time high,2020,"The term tourism includes those people that travel to different places, either locally, nationally or globally for vacation and relaxation, but also for social or economic motives. It is one of the progressive industries whose activities influence the economies of various nations to a great extent. It is significant to note that various past crises have troubled global tourism, but the rapidly evolving global COVID-19 pandemic has confronted this sensitive industry with unprecedented circumstances. The tourism sector contributes significantly to Kashmir’s economy, which is a land of unimaginable scenic beauty with a perfect nature with shining lakes, glaciers and meadows, colourful gardens, orchards and saffron fields, with the magnificent snowy Himalayas, and home of popular pilgrimage sites, in sum a perfect acclaimed tourist destination for national and international tourists. We have chosen it as the study area for the present paper. Tourism is a part of Kashmir valley’s tradition and contributes massively to its economic development. The present situations of travel and tourism has promoted the spread the of highly infectious novel corona virus, which spoils tourism and raises serious questions about the future of this sector. The present paper addresses two important concerns: first it pertains to the unprecedented sociocultural and economic impacts that Kashmir’s tourism industry faces amid current conditions, and second it relates to the significant change in the tourist profession and other activities due to the COVID-19 lockdown. The study draws on documentary research with semi-structured interviews, using purposive sampling together with a phenomenological approach. The findings of the study provide a rapid assessment of the reported impacts of COVID-19 on Kashmir tourism all through 2020 with a speedy decrease in tourist arrivals including documented travel restrictions. The research revealed that the stakeholders of tourism changed their means of livelihood from tourism which comes to a halt, to other possible means and the differential regional impacts of the pandemic on tourist centres as well as the severe implications on the economic development of Kashmir Valley. The findings also reveal that lower economic groups (stakeholders of tourism) were deeply affected by this pandemic. Thus, recognizing the early impacts of COVID-19 and summing up estimates of the damage to the tourism economy amid lockdown and beyond is important to restore tourism activities in Kashmir, vital for people’s livelihoods.","Lakshmi Singh, Abha Jamal Saleha Suhail Ahmad Wani",Research in Globalization,,269
378340,Why airborne transmission hasn’t been conclusive in case of COVID-19? An atmospheric science perspective,2021,"BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are known to impact the functional receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The association between chronic therapy with these medications and infection risk remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to determine the association between prior ACEI or ARB therapy and SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients with hypertension in the U.S. Veteran's Affairs health system. METHODS: We compared the odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection among three groups: patients treated with ACEI, treated with ARB, or treated with alternate first-line anti-hypertensives without ACEI/ARB. We excluded patients with alternate indications for ACEI or ARB therapy. We performed an augmented inverse propensity weighted analysis with adjustment for demographics, region, comorbidities, vitals, and laboratory values. RESULTS: Among 1,724,723 patients with treated hypertension, 659,180 were treated with ACEI, 310,651 with ARB, and 754,892 with neither. Before weighting, patients treated with ACEI or ARB were more likely to be diabetic and use more anti-hypertensives. There were 13,278 SARS-CoV-2 infections (0.8%) between February 12, 2020 and August 19, 2020. Patients treated with ACEI had lower odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection (odds ratio [OR] 0.93; 95% CI: 0.89-0.97) while those treated with ARB had similar odds (OR 1.02; 95% CI: 0.96-1.07) compared with patients treated with alternate first-line anti-hypertensives without ACEI/ARB. In falsification analyses, patients on ACEI did not have a difference in their odds of unrelated outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the safety of continuing ACEI and ARB therapy. The association between ACEI therapy and lower odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection requires further investigation.","Sandhu, Alexander T; Kohsaka, Shun; Lin, Shoutzu; Woo, Christopher Y; Goldstein, Mary K; Heidenreich, Paul A",Am Heart J,,269

382742,T-Basis: a Compact Representation for Neural Networks,2020-07-13,"Can social contextual factors explain international differences in the spread of COVID-19? It is widely assumed that social cohesion, public confidence in government sources of health information and general concern for the welfare of others support health advisories during a pandemic and save lives. We tested this assumption through a time-series analysis of cross-national differences in COVID-19 mortality during an early phase of the pandemic. Country data on income inequality and four dimensions of social capital (trust, group affiliations, civic responsibility and confidence in public institutions) were linked to data on COVID-19 deaths in 84 countries. Associations with deaths were examined using Poisson regression with population-averaged estimators. During a 30-day period after recording their tenth death, mortality was positively related to income inequality, trust and group affiliations and negatively related to social capital from civic engagement and confidence in state institutions. These associations held in bivariate and mutually controlled regression models with controls for population size, age and wealth. The results indicate that societies that are more economically unequal and lack capacity in some dimensions of social capital experienced more COVID-19 deaths. Social trust and belonging to groups were associated with more deaths, possibly due to behavioural contagion and incongruence with physical distancing policy.

383889,Research Updates,2020,"A significant proportion of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 report a new onset of smell or taste loss. The duration of the chemosensory impairment and predictive factors of recovery are still unclear. We aimed to investigate the prevalence, temporal course and recovery predictors in patients who suffered from varying disease severity. Consecutive adult patients diagnosed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 via reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at two coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) Reference Hospitals were contacted to complete a survey reporting chemosensory loss, severity, timing and duration, nasal symptoms, smoking, allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, comorbidities and COVID-19 severity. In a cross-sectional study, we contacted 182 patients and 150 responded. Excluding the critically ill patients, 38% reported gustatory and 41% olfactory impairment (74% severe/anosmia). Most of the patients (88%) recovered their sense of smell by two months (median: 11.5 days; IQR: 13.3). For 23%, the olfactory loss lasted longer than a month. There were no significant differences in the prevalence and duration of chemosensory loss between groups of varying COVID-19 severity, and sexes (all p > 0.05). Moderate hyposmia resolved quicker than more severe loss (p = 0.04). Smell and taste loss are highly prevalent in COVID-19. Most patients recover fast, but nearly one out of ten have not recovered in two months.","Printza, Athanasia; Katotomichelakis, Mihalis; Valsamidis, Konstantinos; Metallidis, Symeon; Panagopoulos, Periklis; Panopoulou, Maria; Petrakis, Vasilis; Constantinidis, Jannis",,,269

399589,Coronavirus blood-clot mystery intensifies,2020,"The pandemic has affected almost 74 million people worldwide as of 17 December 2020. This is the first study that attempts to examine the nexus between the confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, meteorological factors, and the air pollutant namely PM2.5 in six South Asian countries, from 1 March 2020 to 30 June 2020, using the advanced econometric techniques that are robust to heterogeneity across nations. Our findings confirm (1) a strong cross-sectional dependence and significant correlation between COVID-19 cases, deaths, meteorological factors, and air pollutant; (2) long-term relationship between all the meteorological variables, air pollutant, and COVID-19 death cases; (3) temperature, air pressure, and humidity exhibit a significant impact on the COVID-19 confirmed cases, while COVID-19 confirmed cases and air pollutant PM2.5 have a statistically significant impact on the COVID-19 death cases. In this way, the conclusion that high temperature and high humidity increase the transmission of the COVID-19 infections can also be applied to the regions with greater transmission rates, where the minimum temperature is mostly over 21 °C and humidity ranges around 80% for months. From the findings, it is evident that majority of the meteorological factors and air pollutant PM2.5 exhibit significant negative and positive effects on the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and death cases in the six countries under study. Air pollutant PM 2.5 provides more particle surface for the virus to stick and get transported longer distances. Hence, higher particulate pollution levels in the air increase COVID-19 transmission in these six South Asian countries. This information is vital for the government and public health authorities in formulating relevant policies. The study contributes both practically and theoretically to the concerned field of pandemic management.","Jain, Mansi; Sharma, Gagan Deep; Goyal, Meenu; Kaushal, Robin; Sethi, Monica",,,269

Responses to date have been highly variable and it is not clear whether public health guidance has been informed by the best available evidence. We conducted a systematic review to synthesise the evidence on outbreaks of highly contagious diseases in prison. METHODS: We searched seven electronic databases for peer-reviewed articles and official reports published between 1 January 2000 and 28 July 2020. We included quantitative primary research that reported an outbreak of a given contagious disease in a correctional facility and examined the effects of interventions. We excluded studies that did not provide detail on interventions. We synthesised common themes using the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) guideline, identified gaps in the literature and critically appraised the effectiveness of various containment approaches. RESULTS: We identified 28 relevant studies. Investigations were all based in high-income countries and documented outbreaks of tuberculosis, influenza (types A and B), varicella, measles, mumps, adenovirus and COVID-19. Several themes were common to these reports, including the public health implications of infectious disease outbreaks in prison, and the role of interagency collaboration, health communication, screening for contagious diseases, restriction, isolation and quarantine, contact tracing, immunisation programmes, epidemiological surveillance and prison-specific guidelines in addressing any outbreaks. DISCUSSION: Prisons are high-risk settings for the transmission of contagious diseases and there are considerable challenges in managing outbreaks in them. A public health approach to managing COVID-19 in prisons is required.

401937,Verifying Quantized Neural Networks using SMT-Based Model Checking,2021-06-10,"BACKGROUND: . Teriflunomide is an immunomodulatory drug approved for Multiple Sclerosis (MS) treatment that inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway. This mechanism can produce antiviral effects, thus teriflunomide has gained attention during COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, in the last months, some case-reports have been published describing MS patients treated with teriflunomide who developed mild and self-limiting forms of COVID-19. METHODS: Here, we describe the case of a 57-year-old man affected by MS, and treated with teriflunomide, who developed a mild form of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, we provide a detailed literature review about the available cases of COVID-19 in MS patients treated with teriflunomide. We report clinical features, disease course and outcome, and we discuss similarities and differences among patients. RESULTS: Apart from the present report, since February 2020, five papers have been published describing 14 MS patients who developed SARS-CoV-2 infection during teriflunomide treatment. Patients were mostly female (53%), with an average age of 50.5 (±11.3) years. Median EDSS was 2.25 (range 0-6). The average time on treatment with teriflunomide was 3.7 (± 1.6) years. Relevant comorbidities were present in 4 patients (27%). Regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection, the most common symptom was fever (100%) followed by gastrointestinal disturbances (67%), fatigue (55%) and cough (55%). 5 patients were hospitalized and 2 required oxygen support. In patient hospitalized (n=5) compared to the others (n=10), age was significantly higher (59.6 vs 45.9 years, p=0.025) while gender, EDSS, duration of teriflunomide therapy and comorbidities were not significantly different. Outcome was good for all patients with a variable recovery time, ranging from few days to some weeks. Teriflunomide was continued during the entire course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in all patients except for two. Compared to the patients already described, our patient was 7 years older, average time on teriflunomide treatment was about 2.5 years shorter, and median EDSS was 1.5 point lower. Despite significant comorbidities, the outcome was good since our patient was hospitalized but he did not require oxygen supplementation nor intensive care and was able to return at home after only 10 days. Teriflunomide therapy was continued throughout the period. CONCLUSION: Available data suggest that teriflunomide therapy should not be discontinued in MS patients who develop SARS-CoV-2 infection, also in presence of significant comorbidities or clinical conditions requiring hospitalization. Additional studies are necessary to assess if the drug can also have a protective role against SARS-CoV-2.","Capone, Fioravante; Motolese, Francesco; Luce, Tiziano; Rossi, Mariagrazia; Magliozzi, Alessandro; Di Lazzaro, Vincenzo",Mult Scler Relat Disord,,269

However, chiefly focusing on teaching organization and learning process in MOOCs, previous studies have paid inadequate attention to lecturers' discourse. In order to provide some useful views on this issue, this study investigates EFL lecturers' metadiscourse in Chinese university MOOCs to sketch its distinctive pattern across course types. Based on a self-built corpus, this research adopted interpersonal model as theoretical foundation and analyzed the frequency and functions of metadiscourse by AntConc 3.5.7 and IBM SPSS 23. Findings suggest that specific educational context in MOOCs leads to low frequency of metadiscourse and its use is mainly aimed at the enhancement of intelligibility, reliability, and interactivity. Besides, course types with different knowledge structures also exert certain influence on metadiscourse usage. Course types focusing on procedural knowledge (i.e. the knowledge related to practical process) tend to apply metadiscourse to enhance intelligibility and interactivity, while the ones stressing declarative knowledge (i.e. the knowledge related to explicit facts) attach more importance to reliability. Lastly, the paper concludes with implications for EFL lecturers' metadiscourse in Chinese university MOOCs.","Zhang, Dongyun; Sheng, Diyun",Corpus Pragmat,,269
411302,Analyzing social distancing policy effectiveness using Computational Fluid Dynamics inside a bus to prevent COVID-19 airborne transmission,2021,"Loneliness is a common experience in adolescence and is related to a range of mental health problems. Such feelings may have been increased by social distancing measures introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to investigate the effect of loneliness, social contact, and parent relationships on adolescent mental health during lockdown in the UK. Young people aged 11-16 years (n = 894) completed measures of loneliness, social contact, parent-adolescent relationships, and mental health difficulties during the first 11 weeks of lockdown and one-month later (n = 443). We examined cross-sectional associations and longitudinal relationships between loneliness, social contact, and parent relationships and subsequent mental health. Adolescents who reported higher loneliness had significantly higher symptoms of mental health difficulties during lockdown. We found that adolescents who had closer relationships with their parents reported significantly less severe symptoms of mental health difficulties and lower levels of loneliness. We also found that adolescents who spent more time texting others reported higher symptoms of mental health difficulties. Our hypothesis that loneliness would predict poorer mental health one month later was not supported. Time spent texting others at baseline was significantly associated with higher hyperactivity at follow-up, and closeness to parents was significantly associated with lower psychological distress at follow-up. We conclude that while loneliness was associated with greater mental health difficulties at baseline, it did not predict increased mental health difficulties one month later. Moreover, existing mental health problems significantly predicted later increase, thereby highlighting the importance of continuing support for vulnerable people.","Cooper, Kate; Hards, Emily; Moltrecht, Bettina; Reynolds, Shirley; Shum, Adrienne; McElroy, Eoin; Loades, Maria",J Affect Disord,,269
411303,Analyzing social distancing policy effectiveness using Computational Fluid Dynamics inside a bus to prevent COVID-19 airborne transmission,2021,"BACKGROUND: Improved survival rates of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children are often associated with repeated and prolonged hospitalization, creating an immensely stressful situation for the family. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to assess perceived family impact and coping during the child's hospitalization for ALL treatment and identify potential predictors of perceived family impact. INTERVENTIONS/METHODS: A total of 212 families with children hospitalized participated. The hospitalization impact and coping scales were used to assess perceived family impact and coping, respectively. RESULTS: The mean (SD) total score for perceived family impact was 88.11 (22.39); social impact received the highest average score. The mean (SD) total score for family coping was 39.02 (9.84). A significant decrease in family coping was associated with more readmissions. Predictors of perceived family impact were severity of the child's illness, total days of all admissions, and coping, accounting for 37% of the observed variance. CONCLUSIONS: Families were moderately affected by children's hospitalizations; social functioning was most affected. Families' perceived coping effectiveness decreased as the readmissions increased. The higher risk category a child's diagnosis is, the longer a child's hospitalization is, and the less perceived coping effectiveness, the higher family perceived impact. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The findings provide a direction for the development of family-centered supportive intervention programs. Nurses should be aware that the total days of admission and severity of a child's illness are significant factors associated with perceived family impact and likely justify special attention. Family coping enhancement interventions could alleviate perceived family impact.","Lyu, Qi-Yuan; Wong, Frances K Y; You, Li-Ming; Li, Xian-Wen",Cancer Nurs,,269
412024,The sensitivity and specificity analyses of ambient temperature and population size on the transmission rate of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in different provinces of Iran,2020,"The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) generates the mental representations that are the foundation of abstract thought, and provides top-down regulation of emotion through projections to the medial PFC and cingulate cortices. Physiological recordings from dlPFC Delay cells have shown that the generation of mental representations during working memory relies on NMDAR neurotransmission, with surprisingly little contribution from AMPAR. Systemic administration of low ""antidepressant"" doses of the NMDAR antagonist, ketamine, erodes these representations and reduces dlPFC Delay cell firing. In contrast to the dlPFC, V1 neuronal firing to visual stimuli depends on AMPAR, with much less contribution from NMDAR. Similarly, neurons in the dlPFC that respond to sensory events (cue cells, response feedback cells) rely on AMPAR, and systemic ketamine increases their firing. Insults to NMDAR transmission, and the impaired ability for dlPFC to generate mental representations, may contribute to cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, e.g., from genetic insults that weaken NMDAR transmission, or from blockade of NMDAR by kynurenic acid. Elevated levels of kynurenic acid in dlPFC may also contribute to cognitive deficits in other disorders with pronounced neuroinflammation (e.g., Alzheimer's disease), or peripheral infections where kynurenine can enter brain (e.g., delirium from sepsis, ""brain fog"" in COVID19). Much less is known about NMDAR actions in the primate cingulate cortices. However, NMDAR neurotransmission appears to process the affective and visceral responses to pain and other aversive experiences mediated by the cingulate cortices, which may contribute to sustained alterations in mood state. We hypothesize that the very rapid, antidepressant effects of intranasal ketamine may involve the disruption of NMDAR-generated aversive mood states by the anterior and subgenual cingulate cortices, providing a ""foot in the door"" to allow the subsequent return of top-down regulation by higher PFC areas. Thus, the detrimental vs. therapeutic effects of NMDAR blockade may be circuit dependent.","Yang, S.; Seo, H.; Wang, M.; Arnsten, A. F. T.",Front Psychiatry,,269

The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature to scope and assess the effects of specific strategies for the management of the bodies. METHODS: We searched five general, three Chinese and four coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-specific electronic databases. We searched registries of clinical trials, websites of governmental and other relevant organisations, reference lists of the included papers and relevant systematic reviews, and Epistemonikos for relevant systematic reviews. We included guidance documents providing practical advice on the handling of bodies of deceased persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Then, we sought primary evidence of any study design reporting on the efficacy and safety of the identified strategies in coronaviruses. We included evidence relevant to contextual factors (ie, acceptability). A single reviewer extracted data using a pilot-tested form and graded the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. A second reviewer verified the data and assessments. RESULTS: We identified one study proposing an uncommon strategy for autopsies for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome. The study provided very low-certainty evidence that it reduced the risk of transmission. We identified 23 guidance documents providing practical advice on the steps of handling the bodies: preparation, packing, and others and advice related to both the handling of the dead bodies and the use of personal protective equipment by individuals handling them. We did not identify COVID-19 evidence relevant to any of these steps.

417277,"Outotec Oyj, Finland",2020,"Kanagawa and Hokkaido were affected by COVID-19 in the early stage of the pandemic. Japan’s initial response included contact tracing and PCR analysis on anyone who was suspected of having been exposed to SARS-CoV-2. In this retrospective study, we analyzed publicly available COVID-19 registry data from Kanagawa and Hokkaido (n = 4392). Exponential random graph model (ERGM) network analysis was performed to examine demographic and symptomological homophilies. Age, symptomatic, and asymptomatic status homophilies were seen in both prefectures. Symptom homophilies suggest that nuanced genetic differences in the virus may affect its epithelial cell type range and can result in the diversity of symptoms seen in individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2. Environmental variables such as temperature and humidity may also play a role in the overall pathogenesis of the virus. A higher level of asymptomatic transmission was observed in Kanagawa. Moreover, patients who contracted the virus through secondary or tertiary contacts were shown to be asymptomatic more frequently than those who contracted it from primary cases. Additionally, most of the transmissions stopped at the primary and secondary levels. As expected, significant viral transmission was seen in healthcare settings.","Andalibi, Ali Koizumi Naoru Li Meng-Hao Siddique Abu Bakkar",Biology,,269

423548,A Framework for Malicious Traffic Detection in IoT Healthcare Environment,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Due to the impact of COVID-19 epidemic, face-to-face follow-up treatments for patients with chronic pain and implanted spinal cord stimulation (SCS) devices are forced to be delayed or stopped. This has led to more follow ups being done remotely. Meanwhile, with the development of 4G/5G networks, smartphones, and novel devices, remote programming has become possible. Here, we investigated the demand and utility of remote follow-ups including remote programming for SCS for patients with chronic pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire including questions on demographic characteristics, pain history, postimplantation life quality, standard follow-up experience, remote follow-up, and remote programming experience was sent to patients diagnosed as chronic intractable pain and treated with SCS during January 2019 to January 2020. RESULTS: A total of 64 participants completed the questionnaire. About 70% of participants expressed demands for remote follow-ups due to the inconvenience, high costs, and time consumption of traditional follow-up visits. Nearly 97% of participants have attempted remote follow-ups, and about 81% of participants have further tried remote programming. Approximately, 96% of them recognized the benefits. CONCLUSIONS: The remote programming was in high demand among participants. Most of the participants have tried remote follow-ups or even remote programming. The remote programming appeared to be more efficient, economic and were widely recognized among participants.","Han, Yan; Lu, Yang; Wang, Dengyu; Ran, Mingshan; Ren, Qidong; Xie, Duo; Aziz, Tipu Z; Li, Luming; Wang, James Jin",Neuromodulation,,269

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to significant health burden in infected patients especially in those with underlying comorbidities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between comorbidities and their role in the exacerbation of disease in COVID-19 patients leading to fatal outcomes. A systematic review was conducted using data from MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases published from 1 December 2019 to 15 September 2020. Fifty-three articles were included in the systematic review. Of those 53 articles, 8 articles were eligible for meta-analysis. Hypertension, obesity, and diabetes mellitus were identified to be the most prevalent comorbidities in COVID-19 patients. Our meta-analysis showed that cancer, chronic kidney diseases, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension were independently associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients. Chronic kidney disease was statistically the most prominent comorbidity leading to death. However, despite having high prevalence, obesity was not associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients.IMPORTANCE COVID-19 has plagued the world since it was first identified in December 2019. Previous systematic reviews and meta-analysis were limited by various factors such as the usage of non-peer reviewed data and were also limited by the lack of clinical data on a global scale. Comorbidities are frequently cited as risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes. However, the degree to which specific comorbidities impact the disease is debatable. Our study selection involves a global reach and covers all comorbidities that were reported to be involved in the exacerbation of COVID-19 leading to fatal outcomes, which allows us to identify the specific comorbidities that have higher risk in patients. The study highlights COVID-19 high-risk groups. However, further research should focus on the status of comorbidities and prognosis in COVID-19 patients.","Ng, Wern Hann; Tipih, Thomas; Makoah, Nigel A; Vermeulen, Jan-G; Goedhals, Dominique; Sempa, Joseph B; Burt, Felicity J; Taylor, Adam; Mahalingam, Suresh",mBio (Online),,269

Emerging evidence indicates that competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) are involved in various diseases, however, the regulatory mechanisms of ceRNAs underlying HNSCC remain unclear. In this study, we retrieved differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (DElncRNAs), messenger RNAs (DEmRNAs) and microRANs (DEmiRNAs) from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and constructed a ceRNA-based risk model in HNSCC by integrated bioinformatics approaches. Functional enrichment analyses showed that DEmRNAs might be involved in extracellular matrix related biological processes, and protein-protein interaction network further selected out prognostic genes, including MYL1 and ACTN2. Importantly, co-expressed RNAs identified by weighted co-expression gene network analysis constructed the ceRNA networks. Moreover, AC114730.3, AC136375.3, LAT and RYR3 were highly correlated to overall survival of HNSCC by Kaplan-Meier method and univariate Cox regression analysis, which were subsequently implemented multivariate Cox regression analysis to build the risk model. Our study provides a deeper understanding of ceRNAs on the regulatory mechanisms, which will facilitate the expansion of the roles on the ceRNAs in the tumorigenesis, development and treatment of HNSCC.","Xu, Yuzi; Xu, Fengqin; Lv, Yiming; Wang, Siyuan; Li, Jia; Zhou, Chuan; Jiang, Jimin; Xie, Binbin; He, Fuming",Sci Rep,,269

In some countries, the public has been asked to use face covers to mitigate the risk of virus transmission - yet, their outward effectiveness is not ascertained. We used a Background Oriented Schlieren technique to investigate the air flow ejected by a person while quietly and heavily breathing, while coughing, and with different face covers. We found that all face covers without an outlet valve reduce the front flow through jet by more than 90 per cent. For the FFP1 and FFP2 masks without exhalation valve, the front throughflow does not extend beyond one half and one quarter of a metre, respectively. Surgical and hand-made masks, and face shields, generate several leakage jets, including intense backward and downwards jets that may present major hazards. We also simulated an aerosol generating procedure (extubation) and we showed that this is a major hazard for clinicians. These results can aid policy makers to make informed decisions and PPE developers to improve their product effectiveness by design.","Viola, I.

453025,"Energy Recovery Inc, USA",2020,"BACKGROUND: There is a persistent need for mental ill-health prevention and intervention among 'at-risk' and vulnerable subpopulations. Major disruptions to humanity such as the COVID-19 pandemic present an opportunity for a better understanding of the experience of stressors and vulnerability. Faster and better ways of psychological screening and tracking are more generally required in response to the increased demand upon mental health care services. The argument that mental and physical health should be considered together as part of a biopsychosocial approach is garnering acceptance in elite athlete literature. However, the sporting population are unique in that there is an existing stigma of mental health, an under-recognition of mental ill-health as well as engagement difficulties which have hindered research, prevention and intervention efforts. OBJECTIVE: To summarize and evaluate the literature on athletes' increased vulnerability to mental ill-health, and digital mental health solutions as a complement to prevention and intervention. To show relationships between athlete mental health problems and resilience as well as digital mental health screening and tracking and faster and better treatment algorithms. METHODS: Mini review. RESULTS: Consensus statements and systematic reviews indicated that elite athletes have comparable rates of mental ill-health prevalence as the general population. However, peculiar subgroups require disentangling. Innovative expansion of data collection and analytics is required to respond to engagement issues and advance research and treatment programs in the process. Digital platforms, machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence are useful for mental health screening and tracking in various subpopulations. It is necessary to determine appropriate conditions for algorithms for utilization in recommendations. Partnered with real-time automation and machine learning models, valid and reliable behavior sensing and digital mental health screening and tracking tools have the potential to drive a consolidated, measurable and balanced risk assessment and management strategy for the prevention and intervention of the sequelae of mental ill-health. CONCLUSIONS: Athletes are an 'at-risk' subpopulation for mental health problems. However, a subgroup of high-level athletes displayed a resilience which helps them to positively adjust after a period of 'overwhelming' stress. Further consideration of stress and adjustments in brief screening tools is recommended to validate this finding. There is an unrealized potential for broadening the scope of mental health especially symptom and disorder interpretation. Digital platforms for psychological screening and tracking have been widely utilized among general populations but there is yet to be an eminent athlete version. Sport in combination with mental health education should address the barriers to seeking help by increasing awareness of the range of mental ill-health through to positive functioning. A hybrid model of care is recommended, combining traditional face-to-face approaches along with innovative and evaluated digital technologies that may be utilized in prevention and early intervention strategies.","Balcombe, Luke; De Leo, Diego",,,269

467290,Implementation of a MEIoT Weather Station with Exogenous Disturbance Input,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the factors associated with iatrogenic ureteral injury litigation and outcomes. METHODS: The Westlaw legal database was queried for all iatrogenic ureteral injury cases. Variables extracted included available clinical factors, method of settlement, and litigation outcomes. Linear regression analysis was conducted to examine factors associated with award amount. RESULTS: A total of 522 cases from 1961-2019 were included in the study. The most common specialty named was gynecology (353/512, 68.9%), followed by urology (89/512, 17.4%). The most common claim was intraoperative negligence (474/522 cases, 90.8%). Fifty two cases were settled or arbitrated and 470 went to trial. Settlement or arbitration was more likely in cases involving institution-only defendant (15.4% vs 7.3%, p<0.01), academic institution (19.7% vs 7.1%, p<0.01) and patient death (42.9% vs 10.7%; p<0.001). Of cases that went to trial, the verdict favored the defendant in 339/470 cases (72.1%). The median award was $552,822.96 (IQR 187,007-1,063,603). Duration of temporary drainage ($5050/day, pâ¯=â¯0.02), delayed repair (p=0.03), claim of inadequate workup (p=0.03), and claim of failure to supervise trainee (p<0.001) were significantly associated with increasing award amount. CONCLUSION: The majority of ureteral injury litigation ruled in favor of the defendant. However, when awarded, the amount was substantial and correlated with drainage duration, delayed repair, claim of inadequate workup, and failure to supervise trainee. These findings highlight factors perceived to be associated with significant distress and reflect trends in medicolegal decision-making.","Bole, Raevti; Linder, Brian J; Gopalakrishna, Ajay; Kuang, Ruby; Boon, Ashton L; Habermann, Elizabeth B; Ziegelmann, Matthew J; Gettman, Matthew T; Husmann, Douglas A; Viers, Boyd R",Urology,,269

475571,Covid19 and Higher Education: A Degree Course Recommender System Based on Personality Using Rule-Based,2021,"COVID-19 has proven to be a formidable challenge for many countries in the European Union to manage effectively. The European Union has implemented numerous strategies to face emerging issues. Member States have adopted measures such as the closure of borders and significant limitations on the mobility of people to mitigate the spread of the virus. An unprecedented crisis coordination effort between Member States has facilitated the ability to purchase equipment, personal protective equipment, and other medical supplies. Attention has also been focused on providing substantive money for research to find a vaccine and promote effective treatment therapies. Financial support has been made available to protect worker salaries and businesses to help facilitate a return to a functional economy. Lessons learned to date from COVID-19 in the European Union are many; the current crisis highlights the need to think about future pandemics from a population-based management approach and apply outside the box critical thinking. Due to the complexity, intensity, and frequency of complex disasters, global leaders in healthcare, government, and business will need to pivot from siloed approaches to decision-making to embrace multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary levels of cooperation. This cooperation requires courage and leadership to recognize that changes are necessary to avoid making the same mistakes we have planned countless times on avoiding. This study focuses on the European Union's initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic, starting with how the European Union first learned and processed the global information arising out of China, followed by the incremental population-based medicine/management decisions made that currently are defining the European Union's capacity and capability. The capacity to organize, deliver, and monitor care to a specific clinical population under a population-based management target includes strict social distancing strategies, contact testing and tracing, testing for the virus antigen and its antibodies, isolation, and treatment modalities such as new mitigating medications, and finally, a vaccine.","Goniewicz, Krzysztof; Khorram-Manesh, Amir; Hertelendy, Attila J.; Goniewicz, Mariusz; Naylor, Katarzyna; Burkle, Frederick M.",Sustainability,,269

479198,From Base Data To Knowledge Discovery -- A Life Cycle Approach -- Using Multilayer Networks,2021-05-24,"Objective. To develop a novel whole-blood epigenetic biomarker of immune system status, or EpiMarker, that would indicate whether a person with a recent COVID-19 diagnosis is at risk for severe symptoms including Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Methods. Using a novel methyl-sensitive restriction endonuclease approach to measure site-specific DNA methylation profiles, immune system phentoype EpiMarkers are identified using a machine-learning computational bioinformatics platform. The result is a diagnostic network of 20 to 40 immuno DNA methylation sites having the greatest predictive power for identifying patients whose COVID-19 disease will likely progress to ARDS requiring ICU/intubation care. Results. Immune system status in peripheral whole blood provides a sensitive and responsive sentinel signal reflecting how different functional pathways are currently being regulated in a subject. Deciphering this signal status of how immune cells are set to respond provides deep functional information regarding patient health and potential disease phenotypes resulting from a cytokine storm characteristic of a hyper immune inflammatory response to COVID-19 infection. Conclusions. The ability to identify future potential changes in patient health using this novel EpiMarker technology opens new avenues for defending populations from severe disease risks of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Policy Implications. A successful EpiMarker Assay for COVID-19 disease severity risk would allow for two important applications: (1) patients could be triaged early in the course of infection to allow for critical decisions for allocating resources, both in terms of hospital infrastructure (ICU beds, ventilators) and therapeutic drug treatments;and (2) pre-infection, individuals could be screened to identify personnel at low-risk for mission critical assignments (first responders, doctors, nurses, military personnel, etc.) during future pandemics and ongoing battles with viral pathogens like influenza. © 2020, Delaware Academy of Medicine.

481454,COVID-19 in Iran: Forecasting Pandemic Using Deep Learning,2021,"Background & Aims: Liver enzyme abnormalities are common in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Whether or not severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can lead to liver damage per se remains unknown. Herein, we reported the clinical characteristics and liver pathological manifestations of COVID-19 patients with liver enzyme abnormalities. Methods: We analyzed 156 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from 2 designated centers in China and compared clinical features between patients with or without elevated aminotransferases. Postmortem liver biopsies were obtained from 2 cases who had elevated aminotransferases. We investigated the patterns of liver impairment by electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, TUNEL assay and pathological studies. Results: Sixty-four out of 156 (41.0%) patients with COVID-19 had elevated aminotransferases. The median levels of alanine aminotransferase were 50 U/L vs. 19 U/L, respectively, aspartate aminotransferase were 45.5 U/L vs. 24 U/L, respectively in abnormal and normal aminotransferase groups. Liver enzyme abnormalities were associated with disease severity, as well as a series of laboratory tests including higher alveolar-arterial oxygen partial pressure difference, higher gamma-glutamyltransferase, lower albumin, decreased CD4+ T cells and B lymphocytes. Ultrastructural examination identified typical coronavirus particles, characterized by spike structures, in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes in 2 COVID-19 cases. SARS-CoV-2-infected hepatocytes displayed conspicuous mitochondrial swelling, endoplasmic reticulum dilatation and glycogen granule decrease. Histologically, massive hepatic apoptosis and some binuclear hepatocytes were observed. Taken together, both ultrastructural and histological evidence indicated a typical lesion of viral infection. Immunohistochemical results showed scarce CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes. No obvious eosinophil infiltration, cholestasis, fibrin deposition, granuloma, massive central necrosis, or interface hepatitis were observed. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection in the liver directly contributes to hepatic impairment in patients with COVID-19. Hence, a surveillance of viral clearance in liver and long-term outcome of COVID-19 is required. Lay summary: Liver enzyme abnormalities are common in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We reported the clinical characteristics and liver pathological manifestations of COVID-19 patients with elevated liver enzymes. Our findings suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection of the liver is a crucial factor contributing to hepatic impairment in patients with COVID-19.","Wang, Yijin; Liu, Shuhong; Liu, Hongyang; Li, Wei; Lin, Fang; Jiang, Lina; Li, Xi; Xu, Pengfei; Zhang, Lixin; Zhao, Lihua; Cao, Yun; Kang, Jiarui; Yang, Jianfa; Li, Ling; Liu, Xiaoyan; Li, Yan; Nie, Ruifang; Mu, Jinsong; Lu, Fengmin; Zhao, Shousong; Lu, Jiangyang; Zhao, Jingmin",J Hepatol,,269
483774,Can digital vaccine passports potentially bring life back to “true-normal”?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Adherence to medication and lifestyle changes are very important in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. One of the ways is by doing a cardiac rehabilitation program. Cardiac rehabilitation program is divided into three phases. The cardiac rehabilitation program's implementation, especially the second phase, center-based cardiac rehabilitation (CBCR), has many barriers not to participate optimally. Therefore, the third phase, known as home-based cardiac rehabilitation (HBCR), can become a substitute or addition to CBCR. On the other hand, this phase is also an essential part of the patients' functional capacity. During the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic, HBCR has become the leading solution in the cardiac rehabilitation program's sustainability. Innovation is needed in its implementation, such as telerehabilitation. So, the cardiac rehabilitation program can be implemented by patients and monitored by health care providers continuously. SHORT CONCLUSION: Physicians play an essential role in motivating patients and encouraging their family members to commit to a sustainable CR program with telerehabilitation to facilitate its implementation.","Sari, Dian M; Wijaya, Laurentia C G",Egypt Heart J,,269

When compared with conventional opioids, the partial mu-opioid receptor agonist buprenorphine has unique pharmacologic properties that may be more desirable for pain management. The formulations of buprenorphine approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for pain management include intravenous injection, transdermal patch, and buccal film. A comparison of efficacy and safety data from studies of buprenorphine and conventional opioids suggests that buprenorphine may be a better-tolerated treatment option for many patients that provides similar or superior analgesia.

495054,LUX: Smart Mirror with Sentiment Analysis for Mental Comfort,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated pneumonia represent a clinical and scientific challenge. The role of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) in such a crisis remains unclear. METHODS: We examined COVID-19 patients who were supported for acute respiratory failure by both conventional mechanical ventilation (MV) and ECMO at a tertiary care institution in Washington DC. The study period extended from March 23 to April 29. We identified 59 patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation. Of those, 13 patients required ECMO. RESULTS: Nine out of 13 ECMO (69.2%) patients were decannulated from ECMO. All-cause ICU mortality was comparable between both ECMO and MV groups (6 patients [46.15%] vs. 22 patients [47.82 %], p = 0.92). ECMO non-survivors vs survivors had elevated D-dimer (9.740 mcg/ml [4.84-20.00] vs. 3.800 mcg/ml [2.19-9.11], p = 0.05), LDH (1158 ± 344.5 units/L vs. 575.9 ± 124.0 units/L, p = 0.001), and troponin (0.4315 ± 0.465 ng/ml vs. 0.034 ± 0.043 ng/ml, p = 0.04). Time on MV as expected was significantly longer in ECMO groups (563.3 hours [422.1-613.9] vs. 247.9 hours [101.8-479] in MV group, p = 0.0009) as well as ICU length of stay 576.2 hours [457.5-652.8] in ECMO group vs. 322.2 hours [120.6-569.3] in MV group, p = 0.012). CONCLUSION: ECMO is a supportive intervention for COVID-19 associated pneumonia that could be considered if the optimum mechanical ventilation is deemed ineffective. Biomarkers such as D-dimer, LDH, and troponin could help with discerning the clinical prognosis in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Alnababteh, Muhtadi; Hashmi, Muhammad D; Vedantam, Karthik; Chopra, Rajus; Kohli, Akshay; Hayat, Fatima; Kriner, Eric; Molina, Ezequiel; Pratt, Alexandra; Oweis, Emil; Zaaqoq, Akram M",Perfusion,,269

However, traditional phase 3 clinical trials are inefficient. They usually focus on addressing a single primary question, take a very long time to implement from conception to publication of findings, and are very costly. There is a need for improved designs for clinical trials to enable rapid, efficient and better evaluation of treatments;both a need to identify effective treatments, and equally important, to identify ineffective ones early, in order to direct resources to the most promising interventions. It is increasingly recognised that efficiencies could be gained by asking multiple questions in a single protocol. Adaptive platform trials with multi-arm multi-stage (MAMS) designs offer a mechanism for the systematic evaluation of several investigational agents simultaneously and the abandonment of those that do not demonstrate sufficient activity, thereby significantly speed up the rate at which answers can be achieved. This talk will review some general features of adaptive Platform Trials, their advantages and challenges in their design and implementation in a pandemic setting, drawing from experience and lessons learned in conducting such trials in COVID-19.","Babiker, A.",Revue d&#039;Épidémiologie et de Santé Publique,,269

The questionnaire is composed of seven parts, each one includes multiple choice questions aimed to measure the impact of the pandemic on different aspect of daily activities namely: academic performance, social and family relationship, eating and smoking habits, sleep pattern, physical activity and the Depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS-21). The last part was an open question where participants can state their comments about the experiences during the quarantine and how they affected their mental health.ResultA total of 1181 students from the six academic grades responded. Females and students in the third academic year showed the highest prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress. Overall, most respondents reported that the current pandemic had negative impacts on their academic performance (71%) and social relationship (67.5 %). The majority of the students stated that they became less physically active (74.6%) and 52.2% experienced a weight gain. Despite that 60% of the studied population rated their sleeping quality as ‘’very good’’ and ‘’fairly good’’, 45.3% and 39.6% suffered from increased sleeping hours and disturbed sleep respectively. Based on students’ responses of the DASS-21, over half of the participants (62.2%) were experiencing moderate to extremely severe stress and over 33% were consistent with symptoms of extremely severe anxiety. In respect of depression, nearly half of the sample (46.4%) can be described as having extremely severe depression according to the cut-off points of the DASS-21.ConclusionThe current pandemic has increased the challenges and burdens on undergraduate medical students. These impacts can be more profound in developing countries such as Egypt. The levels of psychiatric symptoms are alarming compared to previous local and international studies. These unprecedented consequences should be addressed promptly through students’ counselling and psychiatric assistance.

502457,"Steigende Einkommen, sinkende Sorgen — die Zeit vor Corona",2020,"Homology between human and viral proteins is an established factor in viral- or vaccine-induced autoimmunity. Failure of SARS and MERS vaccines in animal trials involved pathogenesis consistent with an immunological priming that could involve autoimmunity in lung tissues due to previous exposure to the SARS and MERS spike protein. Exposure pathogenesis to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 likely will lead to similar outcomes. Immunogenic peptides in viruses or bacteria that match human proteins are good candidates for pathogenic priming peptides (similar to the more diffuse idea of ""immune enhancement""). Here I provide an assessment of potential for human pathogenesis via autoimmunity via exposure, via infection or injection. SAR-CoV-2 spike proteins, and all other SARS-CoV-2 proteins, immunogenic epitopes in each SARS-CoV-2 protein were compared to human proteins in search of high local homologous matching. Only one immunogenic epitope in a SARS-CoV-2 had no homology to human proteins. If all of the parts of the epitopes that are homologous to human proteins are excluded from consideration due to risk of pathogenic priming, the remaining immunogenic parts of the epitopes may be still immunogenic and remain as potentially viable candidates for vaccine development. Mapping of the genes encoding human protein matches to pathways point to targets that could explain the observed presentation of symptoms in COVID-19 disease. It also strongly points to a large number of opportunities for expected disturbances in the immune system itself, targeting elements of MCH Class I and Class II antigen presentation, PD-1 signaling, cross-presentation of soluble exogenous antigens and the ER-Phagosome pathway. Translational consequences of these findings are explored.","Lyons-Weiler, James",J Transl Autoimmun,,269

Understanding the average duration of recovery and its predictors is crucial in formulating preventive measures and optimizing treatment options. Therefore, evidence showing the duration of recovery from COVID-19 in different contexts and settings is necessary for tailoring appropriate treatment and prevention measures. This study aimed to investigate the average duration and the predictors of recovery from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among COVID-19 patients. METHOD: A hospital-based prospective cohort study was conducted at Eka Kotebe General Hospital, COVID-19 Isolation and Treatment Center from March 18 to June 27, 2020. The Center was the first hospital designated to manage COVID-19 cases in Ethiopia. The study participants were all COVID-19 adult patients who were admitted to the center during the study period. Follow up was done for the participants from the first date of diagnosis to the date of recovery (negative Real-time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCT) test of throat swab). RESULT: A total of 306 COVID-19 cases were followed up to observe the duration of viral clearance by rRT-PCR. Participants' mean age was 34 years (18-84 years) and 69% were male. The median duration of viral clearance from each participant's body was 19 days, but the range was wide: 2 to 71 days. Cough followed by headache was the leading sign of illness among the 67 symptomatic COVID-19 patients; and nearly half of those with comorbidities were known cancer and HIV/AIDS patients on clinical follow up. The median duration of recovery from COVID-19 was different for those with and without previous medical conditions or comorbidities. The rate of recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection was 36% higher in males than in females (p = 0.043, CI: 1.01, 1.85). The rate of recovery was 93% higher in those with at least one comorbidity than in those without any comorbidity. The risk of delayed recovery was not influenced by blood type, BMI and presence of signs or symptoms. The findings showed that study participants without comorbidities recovered more quickly than those with at least one comorbidity. Therefore, isolation and treatment centers should be prepared to manage the delayed stay of patients having comorbidity.","Abrahim, Saro Abdella; Tessema, Masresha; Defar, Atkure; Hussen, Alemayehu; Ejeta, Eshetu; Demoz, Getachew; Tereda, Addisu Birhanu; Dillnessa, Enatenesh; Feleke, Altaye; Amare, Misiker; Nigatu, Frehiwot; Fufa, Yaregal; Refera, Hailu; Aklilu, Ayalew; Kassa, Munir; Kifle, Tsigereda; Whiting, Susan; Tollera, Getachew; Abate, Ebba",PLoS One,,269

The effects are larger in the condition of advanced face personal protective equipment, accounting for up to 69.0% reduction of speech intelligibility. CONCLUSION: The use of face personal protective equipment causes significant verbal communication issues. Healthcare workers, school-aged children, and people affected by voice and hearing disorders may represent specific at-risk groups for impaired speech intelligibility.","Muzzi, Enrico; Chermaz, Carol; Castro, Veronica; Zaninoni, Mattia; Saksida, Amanda; Orzan, Eva",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,269

President Jair Bolsonaro's dangerous brew of neoliberal authoritarianism, science denialism and ableism has plunged this country into catastrophe. In this article we argue that this form (or lack) of public health governance can best be described as governance without (central) government. We begin with an overview of public health governance in the country before introducing the main theoretical concepts that guide our analysis, namely the notions of 'government by exception' and 'strategic ignorance'. Finally, we sketch the main features of this emerging form of (non)governance of COVID-19. We highlight the new forms of solidarity and mutual aid that have emerged in favelas and Indigenous communities, which have stepped in to fill the void left by a limited federal presence. The article concludes by reflecting on what this collapse of public health reveals about the limitations of democratic governance in the age of Bolsonaro.","Ortega, Francisco; Orsini, Michael",Glob Public Health,,269

For an improved understanding of the dependence of sensor structure on sensitivity, a simple theoretical analysis was proposed to predict the sensitivity of biosensors with different SiNW types, widths, and doping concentrations. Based on the theoretical analysis, a biosensor integrating optimized critical factors was designed and fabricated. Optimizations focusing on the following aspects are considered: (1) employing n-type SiNW and controlling the impurity doping concentration of SiNW at approximately 2 × 1016-6 × 1016 atoms/cm3 to obtain a suitable charge density, (2) minimizing the SiNW width to 16.0 nm to increase the surface area-to-volume ratio, (3) using a native oxide layer on SiNW as a gate insulator to transport the captured charge molecules closer to the SiNW surface, (4) modifying the SiNW surface by 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid coupling to form a high-density self-assembled monolayer for enhancing the stability bound molecules, and (5) functionalizing the SiNW with ovalbumin molecules for specifically capturing the target immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecules. The sensing performance was evaluated by detecting IgG with concentrations ranging from 6 aM to 600 nM and control experiments. The SiNW biosensor revealed ultrahigh sensitivity and specific detection of target IgG with a measured limit of detection of 6 aM. The integration of the critical SiNW biosensor factors provides a significant possibility of a rapid and ultrasensitive diagnosis of diseases at their early stages.","Zhang, Hui; Kikuchi, Naoki; Ohshima, Noriyasu; Kajisa, Taira; Sakata, Toshiya; Izumi, Takashi; Sone, Hayato",ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,,269

515729,Enabling High-Accuracy Human Activity Recognition with Fine-Grained Indoor Localization,2021-08-15,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has spurred unprecedented need for specialty palliative care. The Palliative Care Quality Collaborative (PCQC) provides unique infrastructure for rapid data collection and analysis. Objectives: To capture and describe real-time, real-world experiences of specialty palliative care professionals caring for patients with COVID-19 through a rapid reporting tool and registry. Setting: Palliative care clinicians consulted for patients either positive for COVID-19, under investigation for COVID-19, or recovered from COVID-19. Design: The PCQC created a 13-item COVID-19 case report form (CRF), modeled after the PCQC core dataset for specialty palliative care quality measurement. Twelve items offered discrete answer choices and one was open-ended. The CRF was publicized widely (e.g., social media, e-mail list serves) and completed through a link on the PCQC website. Results: Three hundred six reports (298 adult, 8 pediatric) were submitted between April 6, 2020 and October 7, 2020. The majority of patients (83%) were 50 years or older; 25% were 80 or older, and 78% were COVID-19 positive. Male gender identity was significantly more prevalent than female (58% vs. 40%, p < 0.002). The most common comorbidity was cardiovascular disease (23%). Of adult hospital-based patients, 69% were full code before palliative care consultation versus 28% after (p < 0.05). All pediatric patients were full code before and after palliative care consult. Qualitative themes were strained communication with patients, family visitation challenges, communication barriers between clinicians and families, rapid changes in palliative care medical management, community care options difficult to find, lack of testing in community-based settings, and guardianship and legal challenges. Conclusion: Preliminary data from the first 306 patients reported to the PCQC COVID-19 Registry describe palliative care use concentrated among older and higher risk patients and challenges to the provision of palliative care during this pandemic.","Kamal, Arif H; Thienprayoon, Rachel M; Aldridge, Melissa; Bull, Janet; Fazzalaro, Kristyn; Meier, Diane E; Mueller, Lance; Rodgers, Phillip E; McKenna, Kelly A; Pantilat, Steven Z",J. palliat. med,,269

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we hypothesized that atorvastatin could prevent the neurons lost in the hippocampal dentate gyrus region after transient global ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) through its anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic activities. METHOD: Twenty-four male Wistar rats 12-13 weeks old and weighing 250-300 g, were divided randomly into four groups: control, I/R, vehicle (I/R treated with NaCl) and experiment (I/R treated with atorvastatin, 10 mg/kg) and rats were sacrificed 96 hours after I/R. Quantitative expression of genes (caspase 8, p53, bax, bcl2, cytochrome c) was studied. The MDA level, SOD, CAT, and GPx activities were measured with biochemical tests. To detect apoptotic cells, TUNEL and Nissl staining were performed. Mitochondria were prepared from the hippocampus rats, used to the quantification of mitochondrial ROS, ATP level, GSH content, membrane potential, cytochrome c release, and determination of mitochondrial swelling. RESULTS: Atorvastatin attenuated the overexpression of bax, cytochrome C, p53, and caspase8 mRNAs and induced expression of bcl-2 mRNA (P<0.001). Atorvastatin treatment increased anti-oxidant enzyme levels (P<0.01). Treatment with atorvastatin reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells. It could decrease the cytochrome c release (P<0.01), inhibit the decrease of MMP (P<0.001) and increased the ATP level (P<0.001) in mitochondrial hippocampal in compared with I/R group. CONCLUSION: Atorvastatin treatment in I/R rats decreases oxidative stress, production of ROS, apoptosis rate in neuronal cells, and improves the mitochondrial function. Hence, atorvastatin have a proper neuronal protective effect against the I/R injury in the brain.","Yadollah-Damavandi, Soheila; Sharifi, Zahra Nadia; Arani, Hamid Zaferani; Jangholi, Ehsan; Karimi, Aliasghar; Parsa, Yekta; Movassaghi, Shabnam",,,269

We hypothesize that consequent reduction in the frequency of social contacts, personal losses and the experience of general threats in society reduced well-being. METHODS: Data were collected from 1,679 Dutch community-dwelling participants aged 65 to 102 years old comprising a longitudinal online panel. Social and emotional loneliness and mental health were measured in May 2020, i.e., two months after the implementation of the measures, and earlier in October and November 2019. RESULTS: In this pandemic, not only loneliness of older people increased, but mental health remained roughly stable. The policy measures for physical distancing did not cause much social isolation but personal losses, worries about the pandemic, and a decline in trust in societal institutions were associated with increased mental health problems and especially emotional loneliness.

During an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the LTCF an effective screening tool is essential to identify the patients at risk for severe disease. We explored the role of interleukin 6 (IL-6) as a predictor for severe disease during the outbreak of Covid-19 in one LTCF in Slovakia. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective data analysis of cases of COVID-19, diagnosed during the outbreak in one LTCF in Slovakia between April 11, 2020, and May 5, 2020. Within 24 h after the diagnosis of Covid-19, clinical and laboratory screening was performed in the LTCF to identify patients in need of hospitalization. Patients with oxygen saturation below 90% were immediately referred to the hospital. Patients staying in the LFTC were monitored daily and those that developed hypoxemia were transferred to the hospital. We analyzed the association between the IL-6 at the initial assessment and development of hypoxemia during follow up and determined the cut-off of the IL-6 able to predict the development of hypoxemia requiring oxygen therapy. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (11 men, 42 women) with diagnosed Covid-19 were included in the analysis. 19 (53%) patients developed hypoxemia during the disease. Patients with hypoxemia had significantly higher concentrations of IL-6, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase at initial screening. ROC analyses identified IL-6 as the most robust predictor of hypoxemia. The concentration of IL-6 > 24 pg/mL predicted the development of hypoxemia with the sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 88.9%. The positive and negative predictive values were 76.9, and 100% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The concentration of IL-6 > 24 pg/mL at initial assessment predicted the development of hypoxemia requiring hospitalization with excellent sensitivity and good specificity. IL-6 appears as a potential predictor for the development of the severe Covid-19 and might serve for early identification of patients in need of hospitalization. Further studies are needed to evaluate the robustness of the use of IL-6 as an effective screening tool for the severe course of Covid-19.

594337,Computer Game-Based Telerehabilitation Platform Targeting Manual Dexterity: Exercise Is Fun. “You Are Kidding—Right?”,2021-08-27,"Summary Viral respiratory tract infections are a major cause of wheezing in infants. Investigators determined that 80% to 85% of school-aged children with wheezing episodes were tested positive for virus. To more fully understand how viral respiratory tract infections influence asthma, investigators have evaluated the effect of respiratory tract injections on airway symptoms, function, and inflammation. Although the mechanisms by which respiratory viruses enhance lower airway inflammation are not established, cytokines may play a key role in this process. The respiratory epithelial cell is a principal host for respiratory virus replication und is likely to be the first source of cytokines during an acute infection. T cells orchestrate immune responses to both allergens and viruses, and regulate effector cells with virucidal and proinflammalory effects. Although studies demonstrate that virus-specific T cells may contribute to virus-induced lung disease, evidence to define the role of virus-specific T lymphocytes in asthma has not been fully established. Some injections early in life may also have an important immunoregular role in the subsequent development of allergy and asthma. Atopy is characterised by exaggerated Th-2 cell responses to commun allergens with secretion of cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-5 that promote IgE production and eosinophil activation. In contrast, childhood injections typically induce a Th-1 cell response, characterised by secretion oj interferon-γ which enhances the antiviral activities of effector cells. These two types of T cell responses are mutually antagonistic.","Brouard, J; Freymuth, F; Vabret, A; Toutain, F; Duhamel, J.

As a consequence, structural genomics has developed structure-determination pipelines and applied them to a wide range of novel, uncharacterized proteins, often from “microbial dark matter,” and later to proteins from human pathogens. Advances were especially needed in protein production and rapid de novo structure solution. The experimental three-dimensional models were promptly made public, facilitating structure determination of other members of the family and helping to understand their molecular and biochemical functions. Improvements in experimental methods and databases resulted in fast progress in molecular and structural biology.

This refers to the rapid spread of (accurate and false) information, mainly through internet usage increasing. Digital health literacy (DHL) is therefore important for addressing challenges related to online health information and services, as well as for navigation through the complex information landscape with huge amounts of different (and conflicting) information about COVID-19. The aim of this study is to examine the level of DHL in relation to COVID-19 in Slovenian university students and to determine online information-seeking behaviour in order to plan and prepare effective communication interventions for this sub-population. A cross-sectional survey, administered by an online questionnaire, was conducted to collect data on DHL. A total of 3621 students participated, of whom 70% were female and the average age was 22.65 years (SD = 4.65). Bivariate analyses were performed to assess the association of key characteristics with DHL. Overall, the results show that the level of DHL among students is sufficient. Most difficulties were reported in assessing the reliability of information (n = 1484, 49.3%). Approximately one third of the students (n = 847, 27.9%) reported having problems in finding information of their interest, and somewhat more (n = 900, 29.6%) reported difficulties in making a selection among all the information found. Students with a sufficient level of DHL are more likely to seek information through search engines and websites of official institutions, while students with a limited level of DHL more frequently reported using social media for health information searches.

Investigating the transcriptional changes in individuals affected by COVID-19 can help understand and predict the degree of illness and guide clinical outcomes in diverse backgrounds. Methods Analysis of host transcriptome variations via RNA sequencing from naso/oropharyngeal swabs of COVID-19 patients. Results We report strong upregulation of the innate immune response, especially type I interferon pathway, upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Upregulated genes were subjected to a comparative meta-analysis using global datasets to identify a common network of interferon stimulated and viral response genes that mediate the host response and resolution of infection. A large proportion of mis-regulated genes showed a reduction in expression level, suggesting an overall decrease in host mRNA production. Significantly downregulated genes included those encoding olfactory, taste and neuro-sensory receptors. Many pro-inflammatory markers and cytokines were also downregulated or remained unchanged in the COVID-19 patients. Finally, a large number of non-coding RNAs were identified as down-regulated, with a few of the lncRNAs associated with functional roles in directing the response to viral infection. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 infection results in the robust activation of the body’s innate immunity. Reduction of gene expression is well correlated with the clinical manifestations and symptoms of COVID-19 such as the loss of smell and taste, and myocardial and neurological complications.

RT-qPCR is the gold standard test, and comparison of methodologies and reagents, utilizing patient samples, is important to establish reliable diagnostic pipelines. METHODS: Here, we assessed indirect methods that require RNA extraction with direct RT-qPCR on patient samples. Four different RNA extraction kits (Qiagen, Invitrogen, BGI and Norgen Biotek) were compared. For detection, we assessed two recently developed Taqman-based modules (BGI and Norgen Biotek), a SYBR green-based approach (NEB Luna Universal One-Step Kit) with published and newly-developed primers, and clinical results (Seegene STARMag RNA extraction system and Allplex 2019-nCoV RT-qPCR assay). We also tested and optimized direct, extraction-free detection using these RT-qPCR systems and performed a cost analysis of the different methods evaluated here. RESULTS: Most RNA isolation procedures performed similarly, and while all RT-qPCR modules effectively detected purified viral RNA, the BGI system provided overall superior performance (lower detection limit, lower Ct values and higher sensitivity), generating comparable results to original clinical diagnostic data, and identifying samples ranging from 65 copies to 2.1 × 10(5) copies of viral genome/μl. However, the BGI detection system is more expensive than other options tested here. With direct RT-qPCR, simply adding an RNase inhibitor greatly improved detection, without the need for any other treatments (e.g. lysis buffers or boiling). The best direct methods detected ~ 10 fold less virus than indirect methods, but this simplified approach reduced sample handling, as well as assay time and cost. CONCLUSIONS: With extracted RNA, the BGI RT-qPCR detection system exhibited superior performance over the Norgen system, matching initial clinical diagnosis with the Seegene Allplex assay. The BGI system was also suitable for direct, extraction-free analysis, providing 78.4% sensitivity. The Norgen system, however, still accurately detected samples with a clinical Ct < 33 from extracted RNA, provided significant cost savings, and was superior to SYBR green assays that exhibited reduced specificity.

602042,Evaluation of COVID-19 chest computed tomography: A texture analysis based on three-dimensional entropy(),2021-04-01,"INTRODUCTION: Rapid technology development due to the introduction of Industrial Revolution 4.0 and Internet of Things has created a demand and gradual transition from traditional teaching and learning to technology-based learning in higher education, including healthcare education. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this process, with educators now required to quickly adapt to and adopt such changes. The abundance of available systematic reviews has made the effectiveness of such approaches ambiguous especially in healthcare education. Therefore, a protocol of the overview of systematic reviews (OoSR) is planned to extrapolate the effectiveness of technology-based learning in undergraduate healthcare education. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Scopus, CINAHL, Academic Search Complete, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection databases were selected. Screening was conducted independently by at least two authors and the decision for inclusion was done through discussion or involvement of an arbiter against a predetermined criteria. Included articles will be evaluated for quality using A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews and Risk of Bias in Systematic Review tools, while primary systematic review articles will be cross-checked and reported for any overlapping using the ‘corrected covered area’ method. Only narrative synthesis will be employed according to the predefined themes into two major dimensions—theory and knowledge generation (focusing on cognitive taxonomy due to its ability to be generalised across disciplines), and clinical-based competence (focusing on psychomotor and affective taxonomies due to discipline-specific influence). The type of technology used will be identified and extracted. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The OoSR involves analysis of secondary data from published literature, thus ethical approval is not required. The findings will provide a valuable insight for policymakers, stakeholders, and researchers in terms of technology-based learning implementation and gaps identification. The findings will be published in several reports due to the extensiveness of the topic and will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conferences.

METHODS: Eligible Japanese tourists (1,480) aged ≥15 years traveling in Chiangmai Province in the north, Ayutthaya Province in the center, Kanchanaburi Province in the west, Pattaya City in the east, and Krabi Province in the south of Thailand were enrolled in the study. Of these tourists, 1,318 consented to participate in this study and completed questionnaires in Japanese, giving a response rate of 89.1%. RESULTS: Among these Japanese tourists 21.3% had diarrheal illness, and of these tourists, 5.0% had classical travelers’ diarrhea (TD), 11.8% had mild TD, 3.3% had good food and drink related behaviors, and 75.4% had moderate level of perception of diarrhea related to drinking and eating. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated three significant diarrheal illness predictors: large number of previous visits to Thailand, longer stay in Thailand, and the experience of visiting other countries. Furthermore, 56.9% suggested providing an adequate number of toilets at tourist destinations; 53.9% suggested providing a 24-hour emergency call facility for a public ambulance; and 51.9% suggested providing garbage bins and garbage disposal facilities at tourist destinations. CONCLUSIONS: TD still affects experienced Japanese tourists who visit Thailand. Although the proportions of the good levels of food and drink related behaviors were low, there were indications that Japanese tourists perceived the risk of contracting TD.","Suwannapong, Nawarat; Howteerakul, Nopporn; Boonshuyar, Chaweewon",Environ Health Prev Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/bf02905277; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21432378/,269

COVID-19 has been spreading rapidly worldwide within just a few months. Our aims were to analyze clinical and laboratory abnormalities in ICU patients with COVID-19, in order to define which predictors can distinguish between those who are at higher risk of developing fatal versus non-fatal forms of the disease. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional survey was used; demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory parameters at ICU admission, and clinical outcomes for the adult patients admitted to ICU were collected from five hospitals in Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: A total of 86 patients with COVID-19 admitted in ICU, 50 patients died, 23 recovered, and 13 were still admitted, with a mortality rate of 58.1%. Septic shock (OR (95% CI): 58.1 (5.97–7812.8), p < 0.001) and acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR (95% CI): 7.279 (1.191–65.43), p = 0.032) had a significant impact on mortality. Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis revealed that septic shock (HR (95% CI): 9.502 (2.958–30.524), p < 0.001) and neutrophil count (HR (95% CI): 1.053 (1.023–1.085), p < 0.001) were significant predictors for mortality. CONCLUSION: Septic shock, AKI, and high neutrophil count were found to be predictive of death in these patients. Further studies are needed to aid efficient recognition and management of severe COVID-19 patients in our population.","Al Mutair, Abbas; Al Mutairi, Alya; Zaidi, Abdul Rehman Zia; Salih, Samer; Alhumaid, Saad; Rabaan, Ali A; Al-Omari, Awad",Int J Gen Med,https://doi.org/10.2147/ijgm.s313757; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34321917/,269

608423,"Evaluation of Hygrothermal Behaviour in Heritage Buildings through Sensors, CFD Modelling and IRT",2021-01-14,"The seasonality of respiratory diseases has been linked, among other factors, to low outdoor absolute humidity and low indoor relative humidity, which increase evaporation of water in the mucosal lining of the respiratory tract. We demonstrate that normal breathing results in an absorption-desorption cycle inside facemasks, in which supersaturated air is absorbed by the mask fibers during expiration, followed by evaporation during inspiration of dry environmental air. For double-layered cotton masks, which have considerable heat capacity, the temperature of inspired air rises above room temperature, and the effective increase in relative humidity can exceed 100%. We propose that the recently reported, disease-attenuating effect of generic facemasks is dominated by the strong humidity increase of inspired air. This elevated humidity promotes mucociliary clearance of pathogens from the lungs, both before and after an infection of the upper respiratory tract has occurred. Effective mucociliary clearance can delay and reduce infection of the lower respiratory tract, thus mitigating disease severity. This mode of action suggests that masks can benefit the wearer even after an infection in the upper respiratory tract has occurred, complementing the traditional function of masks to limit person-to-person disease transmission. This potential therapeutical use should be studied further.","Courtney, Joseph M.; Bax, Ad",Biophys J,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006349521001168; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349521001168?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33582134/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2021.02.002,269

OBJECTIVE: To examine aspects of self-reported mental and physical health among adolescents in Norway before and during the pandemic, including the role of pandemic-associated anxiety. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study examined a diverse nationwide sample of grade 11 students from the longitudinal MyLife study in Norway. The original study recruitment of all 8th, 9th, and 10th graders from the same middle schools facilitated identification of 2 sociodemographically comparable cohorts assessed in October to December 2018 and 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, and October to December 2020, during the pandemic. School entry and enrollment in Norway is determined by the birth year, and students usually start high school (11th grade) during the fall of the year of their 16th birthday. Data were analyzed from March to June 2021. EXPOSURES: The COVID-19 pandemic and associated conditions in Norway. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: In grades 10 and 11, adolescents reported their depression symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (cutoff scores for moderate/severe depression, ≥15), number of close friends, physical health, and organized sports participation. Cohort differences were examined with a set of nested regression models, incrementally controlling for sociodemographic covariates and grade 10 outcomes. RESULTS: A sample of 2536 adolescents (1505 [59.4%] girls) was analyzed, including 1621 adolescents before the pandemic and 915 adolescents during the pandemic, of whom 158 adolescents (17.3%) reported high pandemic anxiety. The only significant difference in outcomes between the COVID-19 cohort and the pre–COVID-19 cohort were lower odds of organized sports participation (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.69; 95% CI, 0.56-0.87). However, in subanalyses comparing adolescents with high anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic with adolescents in the pre–COVID-19 cohort, adolescents with high pandemic anxiety were more likely to experience clinical-level depression symptoms (aOR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.39-3.37) and poor physical health (aOR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.01-2.31). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of Norwegian adolescents, adolescents who started high school during the pandemic year had lower odds of organized sports participation in late 2020, but were otherwise comparable in terms of self-reported mental and physical health with their pre–COVID-19 counterparts. However, adolescents in the COVID-19 cohort experiencing high pandemic-related anxiety had significantly greater odds of poorer mental and physical health than adolescents in the pre–COVID-19 cohort.

Proctological patients and surgeons are experiencing a previously unseen change in care with unknown repercussion. Here we discuss the proctological experience of 4 Italian hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Following remote brainstorming, the authors summarised their experience in managing proctological patients during the COVID-19 pandemics and put forward some practical observations to further investigate. RESULTS: The 4 hospitals shifted from a high-volume proctological activity to almost “zero” visits and surgery. Every patient accessing the hospital must respect a specific COVID-19 protocol. Proctological patients can be stratified based on presentation and management considerations into (1) neoplastic patients, the only allowed to be surgically treated, (2) the ones requiring urgent care, operated only in highly selected cases and (3) the stable, already known patients, managed remotely. Changes in the clinical management of the proctological disease are presented together with some considerations to be explored. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of scientific evidence, these practical considerations may be valuable to proctological surgeons starting to face the COVID-19 pandemics. Beside the more clinical considerations, this crisis produced unexpected consequences such as an improvement of the therapeutic alliance and a shift towards telemedicine that may be worth exploring also in the post-COVID-19 era.","Mascagni, Domenico; Eberspacher, Chiara; Mascagni, Pietro; Arezzo, Alberto; Selvaggi, Francesco; Sturiale, Alessandro; Milito, Giovanni; Naldini, Gabriele",Int J Colorectal Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32468103/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00384-020-03622-x,269

612086,Llamanade: an open-source computational pipeline for robust nanobody humanization,2021-08-04,"Phylogenetic trees from real-world data often include short edges with very few substitutions per site, which can lead to partially resolved trees and poor accuracy. Theory indicates that the number of sites needed to accurately reconstruct a fully resolved tree grows at a rate proportional to the inverse square of the length of the shortest edge. However, when inferred trees are partially resolved due to short edges, “accuracy” should be defined as the rate of discovering false splits (clades on a rooted tree) relative to the actual number found. Thus, accuracy can be high even if short edges are common. Specifically, in a “near-perfect” parameter space in which trees are large, the tree length ξ (the sum of all edge lengths) is small, and rate variation is minimal, the expected false positive rate is less than ξ∕3; the exact value depends on tree shape and sequence length. This expected false positive rate is far below the false negative rate for small ξ and often well below 5% even when some assumptions are relaxed. We show this result analytically for maximum parsimony and explore its extension to maximum likelihood using theory and simulations. For hypothesis testing, we show that measures of split “support” that rely on bootstrap resampling consistently imply weaker support than that implied by the false positive rates in near-perfect trees. The near-perfect parameter space closely fits several empirical studies of human virus diversification during outbreaks and epidemics, including Ebolavirus, Zika virus, and SARS-CoV-2, reflecting low substitution rates relative to high transmission/sampling rates in these viruses.","Wertheim, Joel O; Steel, Mike; Sanderson, Michael J",Syst Biol,https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syab069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34398231/,269

OBJECTIVE: To compare the full-length genome sequences of the Chinese IBV strain CK/CH/LDL/97I and its embryo-passaged, attenuated level to identify sequence substitutions responsible for the attenuation and define markers of attenuation. METHODS: The full-length genomes of CK/CH/LDL/97I P5 and P115 were amplified and sequenced. The sequences were assembled and compared using the MEGALIGN program (DNAStar) and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA4 software. RESULTS: The CK/CH/LDL/97I virus population contained subpopulations with a mixture of genetic mutants. Changes were observed in nsp4, nsp9, nsp11/12, nsp14, nsp15, nsp16, and ORF3a, but these did not result in amino acid substitutions or did not show functional variations. Amino acid substitutions occurred in the remaining genes between P5 and P115; most were found in the S region, and some of the nucleotide mutations resulted in amino acid substitutions. Among the 9 nsps in the ORF1 region, nsp3 contained the most nucleotide substitutions. CONCLUSIONS: Sequence variations in different genes, especially the S gene and nsp3, in the genomes of CK/CH/LDL/97I viruses might contribute to differences in viral replication, pathogenicity, antigenicity, immunogenicity, and tissue tropism.","Zhao, Fei; Han, Zongxi; Zhang, Tingting; Shao, Yuhao; Kong, Xiangang; Ma, Huijie; Liu, Shengwang",Intervirology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000365193; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25195733/,269

Almost all countries in the ESA sub region implemented the WHO-recommended preventive measures variably after the notification of community transmission of the COVID-19 disease. This resulted in the disruption of the outpatient, immunization surveillance, and the related supply chain activities. METHODS: a comparative analysis study design of secondary acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance data received from the East and Southern Africa sub-region countries to evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic in the AFP field surveillance for the same time period of March to December 2019 and 2020. RESULTS: we observed that 52.4% of second stool samples were received in the laboratory within 72 hours from March to December 2019, and only 48.1% in the same period of 2020. A 4.3% decline with a p-value of <0.0001 (95% CI, ranges from 2.326% to 6.269%). Similarly, we noted a 4.7% decline in the number of reported AFP cases in the ESA sub-region for March to December 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, a p-value of less than 0.001 (95% CI ranges from 2.785 to 6.614).

618028,Analysis of Single Board Architectures Integrating Sensors Technologies †,2021-09-21,"This paper presents a normative analysis of restrictive measures in response to a pandemic emergency. It applies to the context presented by the Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global outbreak of 2019, as well as to future pandemics. First, a Millian-liberal argument justifies lockdown measures in order to protect liberty under pandemic conditions, consistent with commonly accepted principles of public health ethics. Second, a wider argument contextualizes specific issues that attend acting on the justified lockdown for western liberal democratic states, as modeled on discourse and accounted for by Jürgen Habermas. The authors argue that a range of norms are constructed in societies that, justifiably, need to be curtailed for the pandemic. The state has to take on the unusual role of sole guardian of norms under emergency pandemic conditions. Consistently with both the Millian-liberal justification and elements of Habermasian discourse ethics, they argue that that role can only be justified where it includes strategy for how to return political decisionmaking to the status quo ante. This is because emergency conditions are only justified as a means to protecting prepandemic norms. To this end, the authors propose that an emergency power committee is necessary to guarantee that state action during pandemic is aimed at re-establishing the conditions of legitimacy of government action that ecological factors (a virus) have temporarily curtailed.","RAINEY, STEPHEN; GIUBILINI, ALBERTO",Cambridge quarterly of healthcare ethics : CQ : the international journal of healthcare ethics committees,https://doi.org/10.1017/s096318012000078x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33004091/,269

622906,PLASTIC SURGERY AND THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: A REVIEW OF CLINICAL GUIDELINES,2020-05-01,"Background: little is known about the forecasting of new variants of SARS-COV-2 in North America and the interaction of variants with vaccine-derived neutralizing antibodies. Methods: the affinity scores of the spike receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) of B.1.1.7, B. 1.351, B.1.617, and P.1 variants in interaction with the neutralizing antibody (CV30 isolated from a patient), and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor were predicted using the template-based computational modeling. From the Nextstrain global database, we identified prevalent mutations of S-RBD of SARS-CoV-2 from December 2019 to April 2021. Pre- and post-vaccination time series forecasting models were developed based on the prediction of neutralizing antibody affinity scores for S-RBD of the variants. Results: the proportion of the B.1.1.7 variant in North America is growing rapidly, but the rate will reduce due to high affinity (~90%) to the neutralizing antibody once herd immunity is reached. Currently, the rates of isolation of B. 1.351, B.1.617, and P.1 variants are slowly increasing in North America. Herd immunity is able to relatively control these variants due to their low affinity (~70%) to the neutralizing antibody. The S-RBD of B.1.617 has a 110% increased affinity score to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) in comparison to the wild-type structure, making it highly infectious. Conclusion: The newly emerged B.1.351, B.1.617, and P.1 variants escape from vaccine-induced neutralizing immunity and continue circulating in North America in post- herd immunity era. Our study strongly suggests that a third dose of vaccine is urgently needed to cover novel variants with affinity scores (equal or less than 70%) to eliminate developing viral mutations and reduce transmission rates.","Quinonez, Elena; Vahed, Majid; Hashemi Shahraki, Abdolrazagh; Mirsaeidi, Mehdi",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13050930; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34067890/,269

It is generally believed that the interaction between different infectious agents plays an important role in regard to respiratory diseases. Therefore, we used high-throughput sequencing combined with viral metagenomics to characterise the viral community of tonsil samples from pigs coming from a conventional herd with lesions in the respiratory tract at slaughter. In parallel, samples from specific pathogen-free pigs were also analysed. This study showed a variable co-infection rate in the different pigs. The differences were not seen at the group level but in individual pigs. Some viruses such as adenoviruses and certain picornaviruses could be found in most pigs, while others such as different parvoviruses and anelloviruses were only identified in a few pigs. In addition, the complete coding region of porcine parvovirus 7 was obtained, as were the complete genomes of two teschoviruses. The results from this study will aid in elucidating which viruses are circulating in both healthy pigs and in pigs associated with respiratory illness. This knowledge is needed for future investigations into the role of viral-viral interactions in relation to disease development.","Blomström, Anne-Lie; Ye, Xingyu; Fossum, Caroline; Wallgren, Per; Berg, Mikael",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v10070382; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30036964/,269

The immunopathogenesis of the infection is currently unknown. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at highest risk of infection and disease. Aim of the study was to assess the sero-prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in an Italian cohort of HCWs exposed to COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay (BioMedomics IgM-IgG Combined Antibody Rapid Test) was adopted to assess the prevalence of IgG and IgM against SARS-CoV-2. It was ethically approved (“Milano Area 1” Ethical Committee prot. n. 2020/ST/057). RESULTS: A total of 202 individuals (median age 45 years; 34.7% males) were retrospectively recruited in an Italian hospital (Milan, Italy). The percentage (95% CI) of recruited individuals with IgM and IgG were 14.4% (9.6–19.2%) and 7.4% (3.8–11.0%), respectively. IgM were more frequently found in males (24.3%), and in individuals aged 20–29 (25.9%) and 60–69 (30.4%) years. No relationship was found between exposure to COVID-19 patients and IgM and IgG positivity. CONCLUSIONS: The present study did show a low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgM in Italian HCWs. New studies are needed to assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in HCWs exposed to COVID-19 patients, as well the role of neutralizing antibodies.","Sotgiu, Giovanni; Barassi, Alessandra; Miozzo, Monica; Saderi, Laura; Piana, Andrea; Orfeo, Nicola; Colosio, Claudio; Felisati, Giovanni; Davì, Matteo; Gerli, Alberto Giovanni; Centanni, Stefano",BMC Pulm Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32727446/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12890-020-01237-0,269

METHODS: This single-center retrospective cohort study included all patients who underwent EAAWHS during the pandemic (from 11 March 2020 to 25 January 2021) and control period (1 year before the same period, from 11 March 2019 to 25 January 2020). Demographic data, preoperative clinical and pathological parameters, intraoperative findings and postoperative complications secondary to operation and COVID-19 infection, length of intensive care and hospital stay of patients were recorded, and the pandemic and control groups were compared. RESULTS: Of the 87 patients who underwent anterior abdominal wall hernia surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic, 41 (47.1%) were operated emergently and 46 (52.9%) were operated electively. Of the 485 patients who underwent anterior abdominal wall hernia surgery during the control period, 24 (4.95%) were operated emergently and 461 (95.05%) were operated electively. The decrease in the number of elective operations and the increase in the number of emergency operations were significant during the pandemic (p < 0.001).There was a decrease in the number of emergency inguinal hernia operations and an increase in the number of emergency ventral (incisional, umbilical) hernia operations during the pandemic period compared to the control period (p < 0.05).The mortality rates were similar (8.3 vs. 9.8%, p > 0.05) in both periods. CONCLUSION: Despite the increase in the number of EAAWHS during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was no significant difference in mortality and morbidity rates.

These efforts have exponentially risen since the outbreak of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has prompted a move to novel systems of care, largely based on telehealth delivery. This article aims to provide a broad review of evidence for telehealth assessment and treatment of externalizing disorders and internalizing disorders in children and discuss practice considerations and established guidelines for telehealth delivery. Existing literature supports the promise of behavioral health interventions including behavioral parent training and combination approaches for externalizing disorders as well as cognitive-behavioral based interventions for internalizing disorders. There is a scarcity of work on assessment via telehealth compared with the available treatment literature. While treatment may be most pressing given the COVID-19 circumstances to continue delivery of care, movement toward establishing evidence-based assessment via telehealth will be of increased importance. Lastly, practice guidelines have been set forth by national associations, professional societies, and supported by the development of national Telehealth Centers of Excellence.

628184,Atomistic Autophagy: The Structures of Cellular Self-Digestion,2014-04-10,"A major issue in identification of protective T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 lies in distinguishing people infected with SARS-CoV-2 from those with cross-reactive immunity generated by exposure to other coronaviruses. We characterised SARS-CoV-2 T cell immune responses in 168 PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects and 118 seronegative subjects without known SARS-CoV-2 exposure using a range of T cell assays that differentially capture immune cell function. Strong ex vivo ELISpot and proliferation responses to multiple antigens (including M, NP and ORF3) were found in those who had been infected by SARS-CoV-2 but were rare in pre-pandemic and unexposed seronegative subjects. However, seronegative doctors with high occupational exposure and recent COVID-19 compatible illness showed patterns of T cell responses characteristic of infection, indicating that these readouts are highly sensitive. By contrast, over 90% of convalescent or unexposed people showed proliferation and cellular lactate responses to spike subunits S1/S2, indicating pre-existing cross-reactive T cell populations. The detection of T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 is therefore critically dependent on the choice of assay and antigen. Memory responses to specific non-spike proteins provides a method to distinguish recent infection from pre-existing immunity in exposed populations.","Ogbe, A.; Kronsteiner, B.; Skelly, D.

We model the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in the city during the pandemic and estimate the effectiveness of public health interventions (overall and for each major intervention separately) for the entire population and by age group. We estimate that the overall effective reproductive number was 2.99 at the beginning of the pandemic wave and reduced to 0.93 one week after the stay-at-home mandate. Most age groups experienced similar reductions in transmission. Interventions reducing contact rates were associated with a 70.7% (95% CI: 65.0 - 76.4%) reduction of transmission overall and >50% for all age groups during the pandemic. Face covering was associated with a 6.6% (95% CI: 0.8 - 12.4%) reduction of transmission overall and up to 20% for 65+ year-olds during the first month of implementation. Accounting for the amount of time masks are in use (i.e. mainly outside homes), these findings indicate universal masking could reduce transmission by up to 28-32% when lockdown-like measures are lifted, if the high effectiveness estimated for older adults were achieved for all ages.

Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate intramuscular injection (DMPA-IM) prescription is typically administered by a health care professional, whereas DMPA-subcutaneous has the potential to be safely self-injected by patients, avoiding contact with a health care professional. However, DMPA-subcutaneous is rarely prescribed despite its U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in 2004 and widespread coverage by both state Medicaid providers and many private insurers. Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate users are disproportionately non-White, and thus the restriction in DMPA-subcutaneous prescribing may both stem from and contribute to systemic racial health disparities.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in a multi-hospital, academic medical institution in New York City. Outcomes included mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and AKI among hospitalized patients. We also evaluated risk of hospitalization among all patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multilevel logistic regression models were used for analysis. RESULTS: We identified 6,893 patients who met inclusion criteria, of which 4,018 were hospitalized. Among hospitalized patients 374 (9%) had a history of cancer, 281 (7%) experienced AKI, and 1,045 (26%) died. In adjusted analyses, patients with a history of cancer had 1.33 (95% CI = 1.05, 1.69) times the odds of death compared to those without cancer and this appeared to be driven by lung cancer (odds ratio (OR) = 2.44, 95% CI= 1.05, 4.39).

Currently, there are no available vaccines or specific treatments against JCV infections. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The antiviral efficacy of favipiravir (FPV) against JCV infection was evaluated in vitro and in vivo in comparison with that of ribavirin (RBV) and 2’-fluoro-2’-deoxycytidine (2’-FdC). The in vitro inhibitory effect of these drugs on JCV replication was evaluated in Vero and Neuro-2a (N2A) cells. The efficacy of FPV in the treatment of JCV infection in vivo was evaluated in C57BL/6J mice inoculated intracerebrally with JCV, as per the survival, viral titers in the brain, and viral RNA load in the blood. The 90% inhibitory concentrations (IC(90)) of FPV, RBV, and 2’-FdC were 41.0, 61.8, and 13.6 μM in Vero cells and 20.7, 25.8, and 8.8 μM in N2A cells, respectively. All mice infected with 1.0×10(4) TCID(50) died or were sacrificed within 10 days post-infection (dpi) without treatment. However, mice treated with FPV for 5 days [initiated either 2 days prior to infection (−2 dpi–2 dpi) or on the day of infection (0 dpi–4 dpi)] survived significantly longer than control mice, administered with PBS (p = 0.025 and 0.011, respectively). Moreover, at 1 and 3 dpi, the virus titers in the brain were significantly lower in FPV-treated mice (0 dpi–4 dpi) versus PBS-treated mice (p = 0.002 for both 1 and 3 dpi). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Although the intracerebral inoculation route is thought to be a challenging way to evaluate drug efficacy, FPV inhibits the in vitro replication of JCV and prolongs the survival of mice intracerebrally inoculated with JCV. These results will enable the development of a specific antiviral treatment against JCV infections and establishment of an effective animal model.","Kato, Hirofumi; Takayama-Ito, Mutsuyo; Satoh, Masaaki; Kawahara, Madoka; Kitaura, Satoshi; Yoshikawa, Tomoki; Fukushi, Shuetsu; Nakajima, Nozomi; Komeno, Takashi; Furuta, Yousuke; Saijo, Masayuki",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34214091/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0009553,269

641253,Event-Driven Deep Learning for Edge Intelligence (EDL-EI) †,2021-09-08,"Signal-dependent targeting of proteins into and out of the nucleus is mediated by members of the importin (IMP) family of transport receptors, which recognise targeting signals within a cargo protein and mediate passage through the nuclear envelope-embedded nuclear pore complexes. Regulation of this process is paramount to processes such as cell division and differentiation, but is also critically important for viral replication and pathogenesis; phosphorylation appears to play a major role in regulating viral protein nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, along with other posttranslational modifications. This review focuses on viral proteins that utilise the host cell IMP machinery in order to traffic into/out of the nucleus, and in particular those where trafficking is critical to viral replication and/or pathogenesis, such as simian virus SV40 large tumour antigen (T-ag), human papilloma virus E1 protein, human cytomegalovirus processivity factor ppUL44, and various gene products from RNA viruses such as Rabies. Understanding of the mechanisms regulating viral protein nucleocytoplasmic trafficking is paramount to the future development of urgently needed specific and effective anti-viral therapeutics.

Methods Forty residents and forty staff members either naive or previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 were recruited in two NH in Belgium before immunization with two doses of 30g BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine at day 0 and day 21. Binding antibodies (Ab) to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD), spike domains S1 and S2, RBD Ab avidity, and neutralizing Ab against SARS-CoV-2 wild type and B.1.351 variant were assessed at days 0, 21, 28, and 49. Results SARS-CoV-2 naive residents had lower Ab responses to BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination than naive staff. These poor responses involved lower levels of IgG to all domains of the vaccine antigen, lower avidity of RBD IgG, and lower levels of Ab neutralizing the vaccine strain. No naive resident had detectable neutralizing Ab to the B.1.351 variant. High and comparable Ab responses were observed in residents and staff previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Clustering analysis revealed that poor vaccine responders not only included naive residents but also naive staff, emphasizing the heterogeneity of responses to mRNA vaccination in the general population. Conclusions The poor Ab responses to mRNA vaccination observed in infection naive residents and in some naive staff members of NH suggest suboptimal protection against breakthrough infection, especially with variants of concern. Adapted vaccination regimens may be needed to provide optimal protection against COVID-19 to vulnerable populations.","Pannus, P.; Neven, K.

Despite being one of the most unequal regions of the world, there is a scarce report of the effect of socioeconomic conditions on COVID-19 mortality in their countries. We aimed to identify the effect of some socioeconomic inequality-related factors on COVID-19 mortality in Colombia. MethodsWe conducted a survival analysis in a nation-wide retrospective cohort study of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Colombia from March 2nd to October 26th, 2020. We calculated the time to death or recovery for each confirmed case in the cohort. We used an extended multivariable time-dependent Cox regression model to estimate the hazard risk ratio (HR) by age groups, sex, ethnicity, type of health insurance, area of residence, and socioeconomic strata. ResultsThere were 1 033 218 confirmed cases and 30 565 deaths for COVID-19 in Colombia between March 2nd and October 26th. The risk of dying for COVID-19 among confirmed cases was higher in males (HR=1.68 95% CI: 1.64-1.72), in people older than 60 years (HR=296.58 95% CI: 199.22-441.51), in indigenous people (HR=1.20 95% CI: 1.08-1.33), in people with subsidized health insurance regime (HR=1.89 95% CI: 1.83-1.96), and in people living in the very low socioeconomic strata (HR=1.44 95% CI: 1.24-1.68).

In piglets, ETEC having F4 fimbriae (F4(+) ETEC) induce severe diarrhea, dependent on the presence of receptors for F4 (F4R). In this study, porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) was identified as an F4R by comparative proteomic analysis of brush border proteins of F4R(+) and F4R(−) pigs and by adherence/internalization experiments on pAPN-transfected cells. Binding of F4 fimbriae to pAPN depended on sialic acid containing carbohydrate moieties, and resulted in clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the fimbriae. Endocytosis via pAPN was not restricted to F4 fimbriae, but was also observed for anti-pAPN antibodies. Both F4 fimbriae- and pAPN-specific antibodies were taken up in vivo by porcine enterocytes and induced subsequently a rapid immunoglobulin A and G response. In conclusion, we identified pAPN as an endocytotic receptor for F4 fimbriae and highlight the opportunity to target vaccine antigens to this epithelial receptor.

We hypothesised that reductions would vary by patient age and disease type. We examined pre- and in-lockdown ED attendances for two COVID-19 unrelated diagnoses: one likely to be affected by lockdown measures (gastroenteritis), and one likely to be unaffected (appendicitis). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study across two EDs in one London hospital Trust. We compared all adult and paediatric ED attendances, before (January 2020) and during lockdown (March/April 2020). Key patient demographics, method of arrival, and discharge location were compared. We used Systemised Nomenclature of Medicine codes to define attendances for gastroenteritis and appendicitis. RESULTS: ED attendances fell from 1129 per day before lockdown to 584 in lockdown, 51.7% of pre-lockdown rates. In-lockdown attendances were lowest for under-18s (16.0% of pre-lockdown). The proportion of patients admitted to hospital increased from 17.3% to 24.0%, and the proportion admitted to intensive care increased fourfold. Attendances for gastroenteritis fell from 511 to 103, 20.2% of pre-lockdown rates. Attendances for appendicitis also decreased, from 144 to 41, 28.5% of pre-lockdown rates. CONCLUSION: ED attendances fell substantially following lockdown implementation. The biggest reduction was for under-18s. We observed reductions in attendances for gastroenteritis and appendicitis. This may reflect lower rates of infectious disease transmission, although the fall in appendicitis-related attendances suggests that behavioural factors were also important. Larger studies are urgently needed to understand changing patterns of ED use and access to emergency care during the coronavirus 2019 pandemic.","Honeyford, Kate; Coughlan, Charles; Nijman, Ruud G.; Expert, Paul; Burcea, Gabriel; Maconochie, Ian; Kinderlerer, Anne; Cooke, Graham S.; Costelloe, Ceire E.",West J Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.5811/westjem.2021.2.49614; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34125034/,269

These standard procedures should provide breakpoints of bacteria’s susceptibility to NPs and a thorough toxicological examination of every single batch of synthesized NPs.

The preferential phytochemicals were retrieved from Asian plants through the data mining procedure and comprehensive literature study. The three preeminent reliable phytochemical exhibited toxicity by no means during the scrutinization of ADMET prominences. Moreover, pharmacologically distinguishing characteristics and the biological activity of the lead phytochemicals were satisfying as a repurposing antiviral drug contender. Additionally, the molecular dynamics simulation exhibited thermal stability and a stable binding affinity of the protein-compound complex that refers to the appreciable efficacy of the lead optimization. Therefore, the preferable phytochemicals are worth substantial evaluation in the biological laboratory to recommend plausible antiviral drug contenders. ABSTRACT: Currently, a worldwide pandemic has been declared in response to the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a fatal and fast-spreading viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The low availability of efficient vaccines and treatment options has resulted in a high mortality rate, bringing the world economy to its knees. Thus, mechanistic investigations of drugs capable of counteracting this disease are in high demand. The main protease (M(pro)) expressed by SARS-CoV-2 has been targeted for the development of potential drug candidates due to the crucial role played by M(pro) in viral replication and transcription. We generated a phytochemical library containing 1672 phytochemicals derived from 56 plants, which have been reported as having antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal activity. A molecular docking program was used to screen the top three candidate compounds: epicatechin-3-O-gallate, psi-taraxasterol, and catechin gallate, which had respective binding affinities of −8.4, −8.5, and −8.8 kcal/mol. Several active sites in the targeted protein, including Cys145, His41, Met49, Glu66, and Met165, were found to interact with the top three candidate compounds. The multiple simulation profile, root-mean-square deviation, root-mean-square fluctuation, radius of gyration, and solvent-accessible surface area values supported the inflexible nature of the docked protein–compound complexes. The toxicity and carcinogenicity profiles were assessed, which showed that epicatechin-3-O-gallate, psi-taraxasterol, and catechin gallate had favorable pharmacological properties with no adverse effects. These findings suggest that these compounds could be developed as part of an effective drug development pathway to treat COVID-19.","Mahmud, Shafi; Biswas, Suvro; Paul, Gobindo Kumar; Mita, Mohasana Akter; Promi, Maria Meha; Afrose, Shamima; Hasan, Md.

The formation, accumulation and diffusion of pollution particles occurs under complex temporal scales and expands throughout a wide spatial coverage. Seeking to understand the transport patterns of haze pollutants in China, we review a proposed framework of time-evolving directed and weighted air quality correlation networks. In this work, we evaluate monitoring stations’ time-series data from China and California, to test the sensitivity of the framework to region size, climate and pollution magnitude across multiple years (2014–2020). We learn that the use of hourly [Formula: see text] concentration data is needed to detect periodicities in the positive and negative correlations of the concentrations. In addition, we show that the standardization of the correlation function method is required to obtain networks with more meaningful links when evaluating the dispersion of a severe haze event at the North China Plain or a wildfire event in California during December 2017. Post COVID-19 outbreak in China, we observe a significant drop in the magnitude of the assigned weights, indicating the improved air quality and the slowed transport of [Formula: see text] due to the lockdown.

Autophagy also plays an important part in virus infection and propagation. However, some pathogens, including viruses, have evolved unique trick to escape or exploit autophagy. This study explores the mechanism of autophagy induction by porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) in Neuro-2a cells, and examines the role of autophagy in PHEV replication. PHEV triggered autophagy in Neuro-2a cells is dependent on the presence of bulk double- or single-membrane vacuoles, the accumulation of GFP-LC3 fluorescent dots, and the LC3 lipidation. In addition, PHEV induced an incomplete autophagic effect because the degradation level of p62 did not change in PHEV-infected cells. Further validation was captured using LysoTracker and lysosome-associated membrane protein by indirect immunofluorescence labeling in PHEV-infected cells. We also investigated the change in viral replication by pharmacological experiments with the autophagy inducer rapamycin or the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA, and the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine (CQ). Suppression of autophagy by 3-MA increased viral replication, compared with the mock treatment, while promoting of autophagy by rapamycin reduced PHEV replication. CQ treatment enhanced the LC3 lipidation in PHEV-infected Neuro-2a cells but lowered PHEV replication. These results show that PHEV infection induces atypical autophagy and causes the appearance of autophagosomes but blocks the fusion with lysosomes, which is necessary for the replication of PHEV in nerve cells.","Ding, Ning; Zhao, Kui; Lan, Yungang; Li, Zi; Lv, Xiaoling; Su, Jingjing; Lu, Huijun; Gao, Feng; He, Wenqi",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2017.00056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28293544/,269

The aim of this study was to characterize the association between meatpacking plant exposure and clinical outcomes among emergency department (ED) patients with COVID‐19 symptoms. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients presenting to a single ED, from March 1 to May 31, 2020, who had: 1) symptoms consistent with COVID‐19 and 2) a COVID‐19 test performed. The primary outcome was COVID‐19 positivity, and secondary outcomes included hospital admission from the ED, ventilator use, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, hospital length of stay (LOS; <48 or ≥48 h), and mortality. RESULTS: Patients from meatpacking plants were more likely to be Black or Hispanic than the ED patients without this occupational exposure. Patients with a meatpacking plant exposure were more likely to test positive for COVID‐19 (adjusted relative risk [aRR] = 2.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.59 to 3.53) but had similar rates of hospital admission (aRR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.82 to 1.07) and hospital LOS (aRR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.45 to 1.23).

We aimed to assess the accuracy of lung ultrasound (LUS) methods for classification of lung morphology in critically ill ARDS patients under mechanical ventilation. Methods: This was a post hoc analysis on two prospective studies that performed LUS and chest computed tomography (CT) scanning at the same time. Expert panels from the two participating centers separately developed two LUS methods for classifying lung morphology based on LUS aeration scores from a 12-region exam (Amsterdam and Lombardy method). Moreover, a previously developed LUS method based on anterior LUS scores was tested (Piedmont method). Sensitivity and specificity of all three LUS methods was assessed in the cohort of the other center(s) by using CT as the gold standard for classification of lung morphology. Results: The Amsterdam and Lombardy cohorts consisted of 32 and 19 ARDS patients, respectively. From these patients, 23 (45%) had focal lung morphology while others had non-focal lung morphology. The Amsterdam method could classify focal lung morphology with a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 100%, while the Lombardy method had a sensitivity and specificity of 100 and 61%. The Piedmont method had a sensitivity and specificity of 91 and 75% when tested on both cohorts. With both the Amsterdam and Lombardy method, most patients could be classified based on the anterior regions alone. Conclusion: LUS-based methods can accurately classify lung morphology in invasively ventilated ARDS patients compared to gold standard chest CT. The anterior LUS regions showed to be the most discriminant between focal and non-focal lung morphology, although accuracy increased moderately when lateral and posterior LUS regions were integrated in the method.","Pierrakos, Charalampos; Smit, Marry R.; Pisani, Luigi; Paulus, Frederique; Schultz, Marcus J.; Constantin, Jean-Michel; Chiumello, Davide; Mojoli, Francesco; Mongodi, Silvia; Bos, Lieuwe D.

Mucormycosis is a fungal infection primarily affecting immunocompromised individuals. We have observed sudden rise of mucormycosis cases in post COVID 19 patients. Here we have reported 100 cases of mucormycosis associated with COVID 19. To study epidemiology and clinical features of rhino orbital mucormycosis in post COVID 19 patients. To evaluate efficacy of medical as well as surgical treatment in such patients. This was an observational mixed (retrospective + prospective) study with a duration of 2 months. After noting demographic data, necessary radiological investigation was advised and representative tissue was sent for KOH and histopathological examination. Medical and surgical treatment was planned accordingly. Most patients (55%) presented with complaint of headache and facial pain. Hard palate involvement was observed in 45% patients. Unilateral presentation (68%) was more common. Only 25% patients who presented early had normal vision. We reported 22 patients with complete loss of vision. Eye movements were restricted in 58% patients. Diabetes mellitus is most common predisposing factor (65%). 9 patients required orbital exentration. Only 18% patients required Amphotericin for more than 14 days. Immune dysregulation caused by COVID 19 infection in addition to widespread use of steroids and broad-spectrum antibiotics may lead to the development mucormycosis. Diabetes Mellitus type II is another important risk factor and the presence of both have additional effect in causing mucormycosis. Headache and facial pain should be considered highly suspicious of mucormycosis.

One way to improve health care for these patients is to recognize their needs. Nurses, as a large population of health care staff, can be rich sources of information and experience on patients’ care needs. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore nurses’ perception about the care needs of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The present qualitative research was performed using the conventional content analysis approach in Iran from March to May 2020. The participants of this study included the nurses caring for patients with COVID-19, recruited by the purpose sampling method. The data was collected through 20 telephone interviews and analyzed based on the method proposed by Lundman and Graneheim. RESULTS: Qualitative data analysis revealed six main categories including need for psychological consulting, need for quality improvement of services, need for upgrading of information, need for improving of social support, need for spiritual care and need for social welfare. CONCLUSION: The data showed that patients with COVID-19 were psychologically, physically, socially, economically, and spiritually affected by the disease. Therefore, they should be comprehensively supported by health care staff and other supportive systems.","Galehdar, Nasrin; Toulabi, Tahereh; Kamran, Aziz; Heydari, Heshmatolah",BMC Nurs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33308212/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12912-020-00516-9,269

Guidelines to limit the spread of COVID-19 include wearing a face covering in public, limiting close contacts, and physical distancing. In combatting this and future pandemics, it is essential to understand predictors of adherence, such as psychological flexibility. We hypothesized higher psychological flexibility would relate to greater adherence to public health guidelines. Participants (n = 265) were English-reading/speaking adults in the United States and were recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. Included in the present analyses are data from June (n = 360) and July 2020 (n = 265). Measures included the Comprehensive Assessment of ACT Processes (CompACT), which measured psychological flexibility. Outcome measures included mask-wearing and number of close contacts, which were operationalized categorically (100% mask-wearing in public, ≤10 close contacts in past week). Two logistic regression models examined psychological flexibility and distress as predictors of adherence to mask-wearing and limiting close contacts, while controlling for demographic correlates. Results indicated that greater behavioral awareness predicted greater odds of mask-wearing and limiting close contacts. Psychological flexibility, and behavioral awareness specifically, should be investigated in future research as targets for intervention amidst global disasters.","Schneider, Alyssa; Kroska, Emily B.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168247; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34443996/,269

The study reacted rapidly to the COVID-19 pandemic, deploying online questionnaires in March and May 2020. Home-based antibody tests and a further questionnaire were sent to 5220 participants during a two-week period of October 2020. 4.2% (n=201) of participants reported a positive antibody test (3.2% G0s [n=81]; 5.6% G1s [n=120]). 43 reported an invalid test, 7 did not complete and 3 did not report their result. Participants uploaded a photo of their test to enable validation: all positive tests, those where the participant could not interpret the result and a 5% random sample were manually checked against photos. We report 92% agreement (kappa=0.853). Positive tests were compared to additional COVID-19 status information: 58 (1.2%) participants reported a previous positive test, 73 (1.5%) reported that COVID-19 was suspected by a doctor, but not tested and 980 (20.4%) believed they had COVID-19 due to their own suspicions. Of those reporting a positive result on our antibody test, 55 reported that they did not think they had had COVID-19.

The results suggest that all masks attenuate frequencies above 1 kHz, that attenuation is greatest in front of the talker, and that there is substantial variation between mask types, especially cloth masks with different materials and weaves. Transparent masks have poor acoustic performance compared to both medical and cloth masks.

However, it imposes a significant burden on patients and healthcare providers. In this review, we define the scope of telemedicine and present the most up-to-date literature supporting its role for the preanesthesia evaluation. The opportunities and challenges are discussed and approaches to implementation of telemedicine in preanesthesia care are offered. Finally, the future of telemedicine as it pertains to preanesthesia care is examined. RECENT FINDINGS: Although telemedicine for preanesthesia practice was proposed almost two decades ago, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated its implementation. The potential benefits of telemedicine include improved patient satisfaction as well as the ability to provide cost-effective specialty services while reducing the burden on healthcare providers. Limitations to telemedicine include lack of technology, training, regulatory barriers, and an inability to perform a physical exam. SUMMARY: Telemedicine will continue to expand and its application to the preanesthesia evaluation is a clear example of how technology will revolutionize anesthesia practice. In order for telemedicine to continue to expand in the postpandemic period, steps must be taken to ensure that healthcare facilities and providers keep up with the times.","Azizad, Omaira; Joshi, Girish P",Curr. opin. anaesthesiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34608053/; https://doi.org/10.1097/aco.0000000000001064,269

Avec une circulation active de ce virus respiratoire, les services de réanimation de La Réunion ont fait face à une augmentation de cas graves Covid-19. L’objectif de notre présentation est de dresser le « portrait-robot » des cas graves décédés admis dans un service de réanimation à partir d’indicateurs temporels, démographiques et cliniques et constater si ce profil a évolué. Matériels et méthodes La période retenue dans notre étude est de mars 2020 à mars 2021. Un cas grave est défini par: un patient présentant une confirmation biologique d’infection au SARS-CoV2 et nécessitant une prise en charge en réanimation. Les données analysées sont issues de la surveillance active des cas graves développée et animée par Santé publique France. Les cas graves hors résidence à la Réunion ont été exclus. Résultats Au 31 mars 2021, 38 cas graves sont décédés soit un taux de létalité de 19% (n = 38/197). Entre 2020 et 2021, on ne constate pas de différence du taux de létalité avec respectivement 20 % et 18 %. Le sex-ratio (H/F) est de 0,9. L’âge médian est de 68 ans. La durée médiane de séjour en réanimation est de 9,5jours avec un minimum de 0 et un maximum de 38jours. La répartition par classe d’âge révèle que les 65-74 ont le taux de létalité le plus élevé avec 30,6 %. À l’opposé, les 15-44 ans et les 45-64 ans enregistrent une létalité plus faible avec respectivement 7,7% e 16,6 %. Il faut souligner, que la classe d’âge 75 ans et plus considérée comme une population vulnérable à un taux de létalité de 19% équivalent au taux de létalité général. D’un point de vue des indicateurs cliniques, plus de 9 décès sur 10 présentent au moins un facteur de risque (p < 0,001). Les comorbidités les plus fréquemment rapportées sont l’hypertension artérielle (63 %), le diabète (55 %) et l’obésité (39%). Les cas graves décédés ont en moyenne au moins deux comorbidités. À propos de la gravité, 81% des décès ont développés un SDRA dont 63% un SDRA sévère (p < 0,001). Pour la prise en charge thérapeutique, l’oxygénothérapie haute débit (58 %), la ventilation invasive (47 %) et l’ECMO (24 %) ont été les pratiques d’assistance respiratoires privilégiées. Entre 2020 et 2021, nous constatons une modification du profil démographique des décès en réanimation. En 2020, l’âge médian est de 70 ans. Pour 2021, il baisse à 62 ans. En outre, alors qu’en 2020 la majorité des décès est attribuable aux femmes (61 %) pour 2021, 60 % des décès sont des hommes. À l’heure actuelle, on ne constate pas de changement dans la durée de séjour, la gravité, et les comorbidités entre les patients décédés en 2020 et ceux de 2021. Conclusion Le profil type d’une personne décédée en réanimation est: une personne de 65-74 ans, présentant au moins deux facteurs de comorbidités comme l’hypertension artérielle, un diabète ou une obésité avec un SDRA sévère. La circulation du variant sud-africain à partir de janvier 2021 a probablement modifié la démographie du profil. Pour confirmer cette hypothèse, les résultats de séquençage des cas graves permettraient de le confirmer.

One of the methods of detecting these types of changes in COVID-19 patients is an electroencephalogram (EEG) test, which allows information to be obtained about the functioning of the brain as well as diagnosing diseases and predicting their consequences. The aim of the study was to review the latest research on changes in EEG in patients with COVID-19 as a basis for further quantitative electroencephalogram (QEEG) diagnostics and EEG neurofeedback training. Description of the state of knowledge: Based on the available scientific literature using the PubMed database from 2020 and early 2021 regarding changes in the EEG records in patients with COVID-19, 17 publications were included in the analysis. In patients who underwent an EEG test, changes in the frontal area were observed. A few patients were not found to be responsive to external stimuli. Additionally, a previously non-emerging, uncommon pattern in the form of continuous, slightly asymmetric, monomorphic, biphasic and slow delta waves occurred. Conclusion: The results of this analysis clearly indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 virus causes changes in the nervous system that can be manifested and detected in the EEG record. The small number of available articles, the small number of research groups and the lack of control groups suggest the need for further research regarding the short and long term neurological effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the need for unquestionable confirmation that observed changes were caused by the virus per se and did not occur before. The presented studies described non-specific patterns appearing in encephalograms in patients with COVID-19. These observations are the basis for more accurate QEEG diagnostics and EEG neurofeedback training.","Kopańska, Marta; Banaś-Ząbczyk, Agnieszka; Łagowska, Anna; Kuduk, Barbara; Szczygielski, Jacek",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33809957/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10061300,269

Rapid autopsy tissues were evaluated using multi-scale RNASeq methods (bulk, single-nuclei, and spatial RNASeq next-generation sequencing) to provide unprecedented molecular resolution of COVID-19 induced damage. Comparison of infected/uninfected tissues revealed four major regulatory pathways. Effectors within these pathways could constitute novel therapeutic targets, including the complement receptor C3AR1, calcitonin receptor like receptor or decorin. Single-nuclei RNA sequencing of olfactory bulb and prefrontal cortex highlighted remarkable diversity of coronavirus receptors. ACE2 was rarely expressed, while BSG showed diffuse expression, and ANPEP was associated with vascular/mesenchymal cell types. Comparison of lung and lymph node tissues from patients with different symptomatology (one died after a month-long hospitalization with multi-organ involvement, the other after a few days of respiratory symptoms) with digital spatial profiling resulted in distinct molecular phenotypes. Evaluation of COVID-19 rapid autopsy tissues with advanced molecular techniques can identify pathways and effectors, map diverse receptors at the single-cell level, and help dissect differences driving diverging clinical courses among individual patients.

The present study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, satisfaction of patients and physicians, and quality of service provided during virtual visits for Parkinson's disease (PD) patients during the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated limitations. Methods: Thirty-nine PD patients were contacted to schedule virtual visits using the Zoom application. Thereafter, we rated the feasibility, satisfaction, and quality of service provided by virtual visits using patients' and physicians' questionnaires. Results: Twenty-one out of 39 PD patients were scheduled for virtual visits. Nineteen virtual visits out of 21 (90.5%) were conducted successfully; 16 of these were accomplished in the first attempt (76.2%). The scores of satisfaction, quality of service, and set-up/preparation were 9.5 (8.5–10), 9.5 (9–10), and 8 (5–10) for the patients and 9 (7–10), 8 (6–10), and 10 (10–10) for the physicians, respectively. The average time that was saved was 270.79 ± 142.17 min, while an average of 76.38 ± 95.15 km of travel was avoided for the patients per visit. The most common limitations for conducting virtual visits were a lack of Internet connection and the inability to use technology (75%).

676219,Toward human intervention-free clinical diagnosis of intracranial aneurysm via deep neural network,2021-01-22,"SARS-CoV-2 has caused up to 127 million cases of COVID-19. Approximately 5% of COVID-19 patients develop severe illness, and approximately 40% of those with severe illness eventually die, corresponding to more than 2.78 million people. The pathological characteristics of COVID-19 resemble typical sepsis, and severe COVID-19 has been identified as viral sepsis. Progress in sepsis research is important for improving the clinical care of these patients. Recent advances in understanding the pathogenesis of sepsis have led to the view that an uncontrolled inflammatory response and oxidative stress are core factors. However, in the traditional treatment of sepsis, it is difficult to achieve a balance between the inflammation, pathogens (viruses, bacteria, and fungi), and patient tolerance, resulting in high mortality of patients with sepsis. In recent years, nanomaterials mediating reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) and the inflammatory response have shown previously unattainable therapeutic effects on sepsis. Despite these advantages, RONS and inflammatory response-based nanomaterials have yet to be extensively adopted as sepsis therapy. To the best of our knowledge, no review has yet discussed the pathogenesis of sepsis and the application of nanomaterials. To help bridge this gap, we discuss the pathogenesis of sepsis related to inflammation and the overproduction RONS, which activate pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP)-PRR signaling pathways. We also summarize the application of nanomaterials in the treatment of sepsis. As highlighted here, this strategy could synergistically improve the therapeutic efficacy against both RONS and inflammation in sepsis and may prolong survival. Current challenges and future developments for sepsis treatment are also summarized.","Chen, Li; Huang, Qiong; Zhao, Tianjiao; Sui, Lihua; Wang, Shuya; Xiao, Zuoxiu; Nan, Yayun; Ai, Kelong",Redox Biol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213231721002056; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2021.102046; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213231721002056?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34174559/,269

In these cells, the interferon-β, interferon regulatory factor 3, and nuclear factor-κB activities were suppressed compared to those of parental cells, suggesting that nsp11 might serve as a viral interferon antagonist. Differential cellular transcriptome was examined using Affymetrix exon chips representing 28,536 transcripts, and after statistical analyses 66 cellular genes were shown to be upregulated and 104 genes were downregulated by nsp11. These genes were grouped into 5 major signaling pathways according to their functional relations: histone-related, cell cycle and DNA replication, mitogen activated protein kinase signaling, complement, and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways. Of these, the modulation of cell cycle by nsp11 was further investigated since many of the regulated genes fell in this particular pathway. Flow cytometry showed that nsp11 caused the delay of cell cycle progression at the S phase and the BrdU staining confirmed the cell cycle arrest in nsp11-expressing cells. The study provides insights into the understanding of specific cellular responses to nsp11 during PRRSV infection.","Sun, Yan; Li, Dong; Giri, Sumanprava; Prasanth, Supriya G.; Yoo, Dongwan",Biomed Res Int,https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/430508; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24719865/,269

682028,GKD revenues reach all-time high,2020-06-30,"Science has long been vulnerable to research misconduct (RM). Biomedical sciences, with vast financial stakes, carry heightened temptations. However, RM is standardly seen as an undertaking of individual scientists, not as something that could be committed by an organization such as a corporation or university. Rather, organizations are generally regarded merely as supervisors to encourage scientific integrity and investigate suspected RM. Indeed, federal regulations expressly embrace this perspective, and the federal Office of Research Integrity has never deemed an organization guilty of committing RM. This article aims to rewrite this corner of research integrity: organizations can directly commit RM and should be held accountable as such. Although the conclusions apply to organizations such as universities and government agencies, the focus here is on corporations in the biomedical sciences. After defining ‘research misconduct’ in Part II, Part III describes corporate-level RM and distinguishes it from individuals’ misconduct. Part IV provides five case studies exemplifying corporate RM, while Part V discusses implications, describes ways in which federal regulations could already encompass organization-level RM, and identifies some needed legal and regulatory adjustments.","Morreim, E H",J Law Biosci,https://doi.org/10.1093/jlb/lsab014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34221435/,269

The associations of threat and coping appraisals, as described in Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), with motivation to receive COVID-19 vaccination were compared between these groups, too. We recruited 279 frontline physicians and nurses and 768 members of the public by a Facebook advertisement. Participants’ motivation to receive COVID-19 vaccination, perceived severity of and vulnerability to COVID-19, self-efficacy and response efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination, response cost of COVID-19 vaccination, and knowledge about the mechanism of COVID-19 vaccination in light of PMT were determined. The results demonstrated that frontline health workers had higher motivation to receive COVID-19 vaccination than the public. Response efficacy and knowledge of COVID-19 vaccination were positively associated with motivation to receive COVID-19 vaccination in both frontline health workers and the public, whereas perceived vulnerability, perceived severity, and response cost of COVID-19 vaccination were positively associated with motivation in the public but not in frontline physicians and nurses. The factors related to motivation to receive COVID-19 vaccination should be considered when designing programs to increase motivation to receive COVID-19 vaccination among frontline health workers and the public.","Lin, Yen-Ju; Yen, Cheng-Fang; Chang, Yu-Ping; Wang, Peng-Wei",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34065222/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9050528,269

689234,Evaluierung der Maßnahmen zur Reduktion von Notarzteinsätzen in Tirol während der COVID-19-Pandemie,2021-02-10,"Fibrinogen is a well-known risk factor for arterial and venous thrombosis. Its function is not restricted to clot formation, however, as it partakes in a complex interplay between thrombin, soluble plasma fibrinogen, and deposited fibrin matrices. Fibrinogen, like thrombin, participates predominantly in hemostasis to maintain vascular integrity, but executes some important pleiotropic effects: firstly, as observed in thrombin generation experiments, fibrin removes thrombin from free solution by adsorption. The adsorbed thrombin is protected from antithrombins, notably α2-macroglobulin, and remains physiologically active as it can activate factors V, VIII, and platelets. Secondly, immobilized fibrinogen or fibrin matrices activate monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils via Mac-1 interactions. Immobilized fibrin(ogen) thereby elicits a pro-inflammatory response with a reciprocal stimulating effect of the immune system on coagulation. In contrast, soluble fibrinogen prohibits recruitment of these immune cells. Thus, while fibrin matrices elicit a procoagulant response, both directly by protecting thrombin and indirectly through the immune system, high soluble fibrinogen levels might protect patients due to its immune diminutive function. The in vivo influence of the ‘protective’ plasma fibrinogen versus the ‘pro-thrombotic’ fibrin matrices on thrombosis should be explored in future research.","Hulshof, Anne-Marije; Hemker, H.

690428,Medical Images Encryption Based on Adaptive-Robust Multi-Mode Synchronization of Chen Hyper-Chaotic Systems,2021-06-07,"The Nidovirales comprise a genetically diverse group of positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus families that infect a range of invertebrate and vertebrate hosts. Recent metagenomic studies have identified nido-like virus sequences, particularly those related to the Coronaviridae, in a range of aquatic hosts including fish, amphibians and reptiles. We sought to identify additional members of the Coronaviridae in both bony and jawless fish through a combination of total RNA sequencing (meta-transcriptomics) and data mining of published RNA sequencing data, and from this reveal more of the long-term patterns and processes of coronavirus evolution. Accordingly, we identified a number of divergent viruses that fell within the Letovirinae subfamily of the Coronaviridae, including those in a jawless fish – the pouched lamprey. By mining fish transcriptome data we identified additional virus transcripts matching these viruses in bony fish from both marine and freshwater environments. These new viruses retained sequence conservation in the RNA-dependant RNA polymerase across the Coronaviridae, but formed a distinct and diverse phylogenetic group. Although there are broad-scale topological similarities between the phylogenies of the major groups of coronaviruses and their vertebrate hosts, the evolutionary relationships of viruses within the Letovirinae does not mirror that of their hosts. For example, the coronavirus found in the pouched lamprey fell within the phylogenetic diversity of bony fish letoviruses, indicative of past host switching events. Hence, despite possessing a phylogenetic history that likely spans the entire history of the vertebrates, coronavirus evolution has been characterised by relatively frequent cross-species transmission, particularly in hosts that reside in aquatic habitats.","Miller, Allison K; Mifsud, Jonathon C O; Costa, Vincenzo A; Grimwood, Rebecca M; Kitson, Jane; Baker, Cindy; Brosnahan, Cara L; Pande, Anjali; Holmes, Edward C; Gemmell, Neil J; Geoghegan, Jemma L",Virus Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34527280/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/veab050,269
690545,DeepEMhancer: a deep learning solution for cryo-EM volume post-processing,2021-07-15,"Background During the early months of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, risks to pregnant women of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection were uncertain. Pregnant patients can serve as a model for the success of the clinical and public health response during public health emergencies as they are typically in frequent contact with the medical system. Population-based estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infections in pregnancy are unknown due to incomplete ascertainment of pregnancy status or inclusion of only single centers or hospitalized cases. Whether pregnant women were protected by the public health response or through their interactions with obstetrical providers in the early pandemic is poorly understood. Objective(s) To estimate the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in pregnancy and examine disparities by race/ethnicity and English-language proficiency in Washington State. Study Design Pregnant patients with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection diagnosed between March 1-June 30, 2020 were identified within 35 hospitals/clinic systems capturing 61% of annual deliveries in Washington State. Infection rates in pregnancy were estimated overall and by Washington State Accountable Community of Health (ACH) region and cross-sectionally compared to SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in similarly aged adults in Washington State. Race/ethnicity and language used for medical care among the pregnant patients were compared to recent data from Washington State. Results A total of 240 pregnant patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified during the study period with 70.7% from minority racial and ethnic groups. The principal findings in our study are: 1) The SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in pregnancy was 13.9/1,000 deliveries (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.3-23.2) compared to 7.3/1,000 (95%CI 7.2-7.4) in 20-39 year old adults in Washington State (Rate Ratio [RR] 1.7, 95%CI 1.3-2.3), 2) the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate reduced to 11.3/1000 (95%CI 6.3-20.3) when excluding 45 cases of SARS-CoV-2 detected through asymptomatic screening (RR 1.3, 95%CI 0.96-1.9), 3) the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 cases in pregnancy among most non-white racial/ethnic groups was 2-4 fold higher than the race and ethnicity distribution of women in Washington State who delivered live births in 2018, and 5) the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant patients receiving medical care in a non-English language was higher than estimates of limited English proficiency in Washington State (30.4% versus 7.6%). Conclusions The SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in pregnant people was 70% higher than similarly aged adults in Washington State, which could not be completely explained by universal screening at delivery. Pregnant patients from nearly all racial/ethnic minority groups and patients receiving medical care in a non-English language were overrepresented. Pregnant women were not protected from COVID-19 in the early months of the pandemic with the greatest burden of infections occurring in nearly all racial/ethnic minority groups. This data coupled with a broader recognition that pregnancy is a risk factor for severe illness and maternal mortality strongly suggests that pregnant people should be broadly prioritized for COVID-19 vaccine allocation in the U.S. similar to some states.","LOKKEN, Erica M.; TAYLOR, G.
