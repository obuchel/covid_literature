Furthermore, Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) may participate in macrophage activation and lead to the release of inflammatory mediators. The main aim of the present study was to analyze the association between renal BTK expression and clinical indicators. Moreover, BTK knockout mice were used to establish a diabetic model for further research. The results demonstrated that BTK was activated in the kidneys of patients with DN and was associated with the progression of proteinuria, creatinine levels, estimated glomerular filtration rate and pathological changes in the kidneys of patients with DN. Furthermore, BTK knockout was observed to reduce urinary protein excretion, alleviate renal injury and decrease renal inflammation in diabetic mice. This protection may be attributed to BTK-induced suppression of the activation of the Nod-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome. Collectively, it has been demonstrated in the present study that BTK may be a potential target for DN treatment.","Zhao, Jing; Chen, Juan; Li, Yuan-Yuan; Xia, Ling-Ling; Wu, Yong-Gui",Int J Mol Med,702,1

This qualitative article explores the safety of learners in Tokwe-Mukosi disaster-induced displacement schools. The safety of learners in schools influences the education’s agenda. Most of the studies on the safety of learners focus on rural and urban schools at the expense of schools located in disaster-induced displacement sites. This article seeks to explore learners’ safety in disaster-induced displacement schools in Zimbabwe. The 2013 Zimbabwe Constitution and the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education Act 1987 (Section 25:04) emphasise the importance of learners and teachers’ safety. The critical emancipatory research (CER) was used as a theoretical framework in this article. The participants responded to the research question: Are school authorities ensuring safety in disaster-induced displacement relocation site schools, Tokwe Mukosi? Data were generated through photovoice. Participatory action research was used as a research methodology with 15 participants being purposively selected. This article found that learners were not safe in the schools located in disaster-induced displacement areas in Tokwe-Mukosi. To mitigate safety problems, participants recommended that the government and other stakeholders should collectively build a safe learning environment.","Chidarikire, Munyaradzi; Hlalele, Dipane; Tarisayi, Kudzayi S.",Jamba,702,1

In order to fulfill their clinical applications in context of precision medicine, however, more detailed molecular characterization of diverse subgroups and standardized scalable production of certain functional subgroups would be highly desired. Thus far, the generation of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived MSC (iMSC) seems to provide the unique opportunity to solve most obstacles that currently exist to prevent the broad application of MSC as an advanced medicinal product. The features of iMSC include their single cell clone origins, and defined and controllable cultural conditions for their derivation and proliferation. Still, comprehensive research of the molecular and functional heterogeneity of iMSC, just like MSC from any other tissue types, would be required. Furthered on previous efforts on iMSC differentiation and expansion platform and transcriptomic studies, advantages of single cell multi-omics analysis and other up-to-dated technologies would be taken in order to elucidate the molecular origin and regulation of heterogeneity and to obtain iMSC subgroups homogeneous enough for particular clinical conditions. In this perspective, the current obstacles in MSC applications, the advantages of iMSC over MSC and their implications for biological research and clinical applications will be discussed.","Zhang, Juan; Chen, Mingzhuang; Liao, Jinqi; Chang, Chongfei; Liu, Yuqing; Padhiar, Arshad Ahmed; Zhou, Yan; Zhou, Guangqian",Front Cell Dev Biol,702,17

We evaluated patients with MERS-CoV infection in Jeddah to explore reasons for this increase and to assess the epidemiologic and clinical features of this disease. METHODS We identified all cases of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection in Jeddah that were reported to the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health from January 1 through May 16, 2014. We conducted telephone interviews with symptomatic patients who were not health care personnel, and we reviewed hospital records. We identified patients who were reported as being asymptomatic and interviewed them regarding a history of symptoms in the month before testing. Descriptive analyses were performed. RESULTS Of 255 patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection, 93 died (case fatality rate, 36.5%). The median age of all patients was 45 years (interquartile range, 30 to 59), and 174 patients (68.2%) were male. A total of 64 patients (25.1%) were reported to be asymptomatic. Of the 191 symptomatic patients, 40 (20.9%) were health care personnel. Among the 151 symptomatic patients who were not health care personnel, 112 (74.2%) had data that could be assessed, and 109 (97.3%) of these patients had had contact with a health care facility, a person with a confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection, or someone with severe respiratory illness in the 14 days before the onset of illness. The remaining 3 patients (2.7%) reported no such contacts. Of the 64 patients who had been reported as asymptomatic, 33 (52%) were interviewed, and 26 of these 33 (79%) reported at least one symptom that was consistent with a viral respiratory illness. CONCLUSIONS The majority of patients in the Jeddah MERS-CoV outbreak had contact with a health care facility, other patients, or both. This highlights the role of health care-associated transmission.

METHODS Included were 24 esophageal cancer patients with 65 implanted fiducial markers, visible on planning CTs and follow-up CBCTs. All available CBCT scans (n = 236) were rigidly registered to the planning CT with respect to the bony anatomy and the carina. Target coverage was visually inspected and marker position variation was quantified relative to both registration approaches; the variation of systematic (Σ) and random errors (σ) was estimated. RESULTS Automatic carina-based registration was feasible in 94.9% of the CBCT scans, with an adequate target coverage in 91.1% compared to 100% after bony anatomy-based registration. Overall, Σ (σ) in the LR/CC/AP direction was 2.9(2.4)/4.1(2.4)/2.2(1.8) mm using the bony anatomy registration compared to 3.3(3.0)/3.6(2.6)/3.9(3.1) mm for the carina. Mid-thoracic placed markers showed a non-significant but smaller Σ in CC and AP direction when using the carina-based registration. CONCLUSIONS Compared with a bony anatomy-based registration, carina-based registration for esophageal cancer IGRT results in inadequate target coverage in 8.9% of cases. Furthermore, large Σ and σ, requiring larger anisotropic margins, were seen after carina-based registration. Only for tumors entirely confined to the mid-thoracic region the carina-based registration might be slightly favorable.","Machiels, Mélanie; Jin, Peng; van Gurp, Christianne H; van Hooft, Jeanin E; Alderliesten, Tanja; Hulshof, Maarten C C M",Radiation oncology,702,29

We show that cold exposure induces temperature-specific changes to the higher-order chromatin and gene expression profiles of human cells. These changes are particularly dramatic at 18°C, a temperature synonymous with that experienced by patients undergoing controlled deep hypothermia during surgery. Cells exposed to 18°C exhibit largely nuclear-restricted transcriptome changes. These include the nuclear accumulation of mRNAs encoding components of the negative limbs of the core circadian clock, most notably REV-ERBα. This response is accompanied by compaction of higher-order chromatin and hindrance of mRNPs from engaging nuclear pores. Rewarming reverses chromatin compaction and releases the transcripts into the cytoplasm, triggering a pulse of negative limb gene proteins that reset the circadian clock. We show that cold-induced upregulation of REV-ERBα is sufficient to trigger this reset. Our findings uncover principles of the cellular cold response that must be considered for current and future applications involving therapeutic deep hypothermia.","Fischl, Harry; McManus, David; Oldenkamp, Roel; Schermelleh, Lothar; Mellor, Jane; Jagannath, Aarti; Furger, André",The EMBO journal,702,19

METHODS Adult male mice were decerebrated and arterially perfused with a carbogenated, Ringer's solution to establish the DAPM. To allow distinction between central and peripheral actions of interventions, experiments were conducted in both the DAPM and in a ""pithed"" DAPM which has no brainstem or spinal cord control. RESULTS Functional micturition cycles were observed in response to bladder filling. During each void, the bladder showed strong contractions and the external urethral sphincter (EUS) showed bursting activity. Both the frequency and amplitude of non-voiding contractions (NVCs) in DAPM and putative micromotions (pMM) in pithed DAPM increased with bladder filling. Vasopressin (>400 pM) caused dyssynergy of the LUT resulting in retention in DAPM as it increased tonic EUS activity and basal bladder pressure in a dose-dependent manner (basal pressure increase also noted in pithed DAPM). Both neuromuscular blockade (vecuronium) and autonomic ganglion blockade (hexamethonium), initially caused incomplete voiding, and both drugs eventually stopped voiding in DAPM. Intravesical acetic acid (0.2%) decreased the micturition interval. Recordings from the pelvic nerve in the pithed DAPM showed bladder distention-induced activity in the non-noxious range which was associated with pMM. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates the utility of the DAPM which allows a detailed characterization of LUT function in mice.","Ito, Hiroki; Drake, Marcus J; Fry, Christopher H; Kanai, Anthony J; Pickering, Anthony E",Neurourology and urodynamics,702,11

This study evaluated the safety of a no-drain policy after liver resection within an Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) programme. METHODS All hepatectomies performed without prophylactic drainage during 2005-2014 were included. Primary end points were resection-surface-related (RSR) morbidity, defined as the presence of postoperative biloma, hemorrhage or abscess, and reinterventions. Secondary end points were length of stay, total postoperative morbidity, the composite end point of liver surgery-specific complications, readmissions, and 90-day mortality. Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for RSR morbidity. A systematic search was performed to compare the results of this study to literature. RESULTS A total of 538 resections were included in the study. The RSR complication and reintervention rate was 15 and 12%, respectively. Major liver resection (≥3 segments) was an independent risk factor for the development of RSR morbidity (OR 3.01, 95% CI 1.61-5.62; p = 0.001) and need for RSR reintervention (OR 3.02, 95% CI 1.59-5.73; p = 0.001). CONCLUSION RSR morbidity, mortality, and reintervention rates after liver surgery without prophylactic drainage in patients, treated within an ERAS programme, were comparable to previously published data. A no-drain policy after partial hepatectomy seems safe and feasible.","Wong-Lun-Hing, Edgar M; van Woerden, Victor; Lodewick, Toine M; Bemelmans, Marc H A; Olde Damink, Steven W M; Dejong, Cornelis H C; van Dam, Ronald M",Digestive surgery,702,7

This study aims at developing a triple drug interaction model to estimate the combined potency of sevoflurane, propofol, and remifentanil in terms of PTOL. We compare the predictive performance of PTOL and the NSRI with various anaesthetic depth monitors. METHODS Data from three previous studies (n=120) were pooled and reanalysed. Movement response after laryngoscopy was observed with different combinations of propofol-remifentanil, sevoflurane-propofol, and sevoflurane-remifentanil. A triple interaction model to estimate PTOL was developed. The NSRI was derived from PTOL. The ability of PTOL and the NSRI to predict observed tolerance of laryngoscopy (TOL) was compared with the following other measures: (i) effect-site concentrations of sevoflurane, propofol, and remifentanil (CeSEVO, CePROP, and CeREMI); (ii) bispectral index; (iii) two measures of spectral entropy; (iv) composite variability index; and (v) surgical pleth index. RESULTS Sevoflurane and propofol interact additively, whereas remifentanil interacts in a strongly synergistic manner. The effect-site concentrations of sevoflurane and propofol at a PTOL of 50% (Ce50; se) were 2.59 (0.13) vol % and 7.58 (0.49) µg ml(-1). A CeREMI of 1.36 (0.15) ng ml(-1) reduced the Ce50 of sevoflurane and propofol by 50%. The common slope factor was 5.22 (0.52). The PTOL and NSRI predict the movement response to laryngoscopy best. CONCLUSIONS The triple interaction model estimates the potency of any combination of sevoflurane, propofol, and remifentanil expressed as either PTOL or NSRI.","Hannivoort, L N; Vereecke, H E M; Proost, J H; Heyse, B E K; Eleveld, D J; Bouillon, T W; Struys, M M R F; Luginbühl, M",British journal of anaesthesia,702,16

BACKGROUND Whether the benefits of new-generation DES are preserved in women undergoing complex percutaneous revascularization is unknown. METHODS We pooled patient-level data from women enrolled in 26 randomized trials of DES. Study population was categorized according to the presence or absence of CPCI, which was defined as the composite of total stent length >30 mm, ≥2 stents implanted, ≥2 lesions treated, or bifurcation lesion as target vessel. The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, or target lesion revascularization at 3 years of follow-up. RESULTS Of 10,241 women included in the pooled database, 4,629 (45%) underwent CPCI. Compared with non-CPCI, women who underwent CPCI had a higher 3-year risk of MACE (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1.63; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.45 to 1.83; p < 0.0001). In women who underwent CPCI, use of new-generation DES was associated with significantly lower 3-year risk of MACE (adjusted HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.68 to 0.96), target lesion revascularization (adjusted HR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.57 to 0.95), and definite or probable stent thrombosis (ST) (adjusted HR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.30 to 0.83). The benefit of new-generation DES on efficacy and safety outcomes was uniform between CPCI and non-CPCI groups, without evidence of interaction. By landmark analysis, new-generation DES were associated with low rates (≤0.4%) of very-late ST irrespective of procedural complexity. CONCLUSIONS Women undergoing CPCI remain at higher risk of adverse events. The long-term ischemic benefits of new-generation DES platforms are uniform among complex and non-complex percutaneous revascularization procedures in women.","Giustino, Gennaro; Baber, Usman; Aquino, Melissa; Sartori, Samantha; Stone, Gregg W; Leon, Martin B; Genereux, Philippe; Dangas, George D; Chandrasekhar, Jaya; Kimura, Takeshi; Salianski, Olga; Stefanini, Giulio G; Steg, P Gabriel; Windecker, Stephan; Wijns, William; Serruys, Patrick W; Valgimigli, Marco; Morice, Marie-Claude; Camenzind, Edoardo; Weisz, Giora; Smits, Pieter C; Kandzari, David E; Galatius, Soren; Von Birgelen, Clemens; Saporito, Robert; Jeger, Raban V; Mikhail, Ghada W; Itchhaporia, Dipti; Mehta, Laxmi; Ortega, Rebecca; Kim, Hyo-Soo; Kastrati, Adnan; Chieffo, Alaide; Mehran, Roxana",JACC.

METHODS This study adopts two experimental method, with 514 participants in the first study and 357 participants in the second study. RESULTS The results show that the pandemic-induced scarcity perception of ontological security promotes their risk-taking tendency, and the migrant workers' cognitive reflection ability, sense of unfairness and expected benefits play a significant mediating role in this process. The scarcity perception of ontological security promotes migrant workers' risk-taking tendency by reducing the cognitive reflection ability, triggering the sense of unfairness and overstating expected benefits.

We used the synthetic trail pheromone component (Z)-9-hexadecenal, which triggers the same attraction and trail following behavior than the natural trail pheromone. We found that pre-exposure to (Z)-9-hexadecenal increases the acceptance of sucrose solutions of different concentrations, thus changing the antś subjective evaluation of a food reward.

A key question is the role of pre-existing psychiatric disorders in how such measures are experienced. METHODS During the first country-wide lockdown imposed in France, a Covid-19 module was added to the French portion of the ongoing World Mental Health International college student survey. The present study focuses on respondents who completed the survey during that time frame (n = 291). RESULTS Students with prior depression endorsed greater increases in anxiety (72.2% vs 50.9%) and stress (72.2% vs 49.4%), as well as greater decreases in concentration (87.0% vs 72.9%) during lockdown as compared to those without depression history. In multivariate analyses, prior depression was associated with overall stress (AOR = 5.50), financial stress (AOR = 1.95), family stress (AOR = 2.47), work related stress (AOR = 5.15), and stress related to loved ones (AOR = 2.21). Prior depression was also associated with greater probability experiencing increased anxiety (AOR = 2.61) and stress (AOR = 2.55) during lockdown. CONCLUSIONS The findings indicate that the best predictor of experiencing stress and anxiety during the first Covid-19 lockdown was a history of depression prior to the pandemic outbreak. Implementing public health measures such as mandatory national lockdowns should be accompanied by strategies for reaching out to those who are vulnerable due to a history of mental illness.","Husky, Mathilde M; Kovess-Masfety, Viviane; Gobin-Bourdet, Clara; Swendsen, Joel",Comprehensive psychiatry,702,1

The pathogenic genera found in the gut are often those suspected to exist in the birds' habitat, and although correlations are made between bacterial pathogens in the avian gut and those found in their foraging grounds, little is known about the effect of the pathogen on the host, unless the causative organism is lethal. In this review, we provide an overview of the main bacterial pathogens isolated from birds (with particular emphasis on enteropathogenic bacteria) which have the potential to cause disease in both birds and humans, whilst drawing attention to the limitations of traditional detection methods and possible study biases. We consider factors likely to affect the susceptibility of birds to bacterial pathogens, including environmental exposure and heterogeneities within the host population, and present probable avenues of disease transmission amongst birds and from birds to other animal taxa. Our primary aim is to identify gaps in current knowledge and to propose areas for future study.","Benskin, Clare McW H; Wilson, Kenneth; Jones, Keith; Hartley, Ian R",Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society,702,19

We obtain the analytical expression for the ground state of the system and analyze the relationship between the average excitation numbers and the ground-state entanglement. We also study the entanglement dynamics between the two oscillators in both the closed- and open-system cases. In the latter case, the quantum master equation is microscopically derived in the normal-mode representation of the coupled-oscillator system. This work will open a route to the study of quantum information processing and quantum physics based on virtual excitations.","Zhou, Jian-Yong; Zhou, Yue-Hui; Yin, Xian-Li; Huang, Jin-Feng; Liao, Jie-Qiao",Scientific reports,702,27

Since both CAdV types are detectable in the same biological matrices, and viral coinfection with CAdV-1 and CAdV-2 are reported with high frequency, it is urgent to have available a rapid, highly sensitive and specific assay for the diagnosis of CAdV infection and distinction between CAdV-1 and CAdV-2. In order to detect canine adenovirus in biological samples and to rapidly distinguish the two viral types, a SYBR Green real-time PCR assay was optimized to discriminate CAdV-1 and CAdV-2 via a melting curve analysis. The developed assay showed high sensitivity and reproducibility and was highly efficient and specific in discriminating the two CAdV types. This reliable and rapid technique may represent a simple, useful and economic option for simultaneous CAdV types detection, which would be feasible and attractive for all diagnostic laboratories, both for clinical purposes and for epidemiological investigations.","Balboni, Andrea; Dondi, Francesco; Prosperi, Santino; Battilani, Mara",Journal of virological methods,702,20

Currently, pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) are used for treatment of long-bone fracture and lumbar and cervical spine fusion surgery. Clinical studies examining the effects of PEMF on soft tissue healing show promising results. Therefore, we investigated the role of PEMF on rotator cuff healing using a rat rotator cuff repair model. We hypothesized that PEMF exposure following rotator cuff repair would improve tendon mechanical properties, tissue morphology, and alter in vivo joint function. Seventy adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to three groups: bilateral repair with PEMF (n = 30), bilateral repair followed by cage activity (n = 30), and uninjured control with cage activity (n = 10). Rats in the surgical groups were sacrificed at 4, 8, and 16 weeks. Control group was sacrificed at 8 weeks. Passive joint mechanics and gait analysis were assessed over time. Biomechanical analysis and μCT was performed on left shoulders; histological analysis on right shoulders. Results indicate no differences in passive joint mechanics and ambulation. At 4 weeks the PEMF group had decreased cross-sectional area and increased modulus and maximum stress. At 8 weeks the PEMF group had increased modulus and more rounded cells in the midsubstance. At 16 weeks the PEMF group had improved bone quality. Therefore, results indicate that PEMF improves early tendon healing and does not alter joint function in a rat rotator cuff repair model. © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

METHODS Patients with NSCLC who progressed after treatment with EGFR-TKI, and with EGFR T790 M detected by an approved companion diagnostic test (cobas® ), were treated with osimertinib. Plasma samples were collected before and after treatment. Retrospective comprehensive next-generation sequencing (NGS) of ctDNA was performed with Guardant360® . Correlation between relevant mutations in ctDNA prior to treatment and clinical outcomes, as well as mechanisms of acquired resistance, were analyzed. RESULTS Among 147 patients tested, 57 patients received osimertinib, with an overall response rate (ORR) of 58%. NGS was successful in 54 of 55 available banked plasma samples; EGFR driver mutations were detected in 43 (80%) and T790 M in 32 (59%). The ORR differed significantly depending on the ratio (T790 M allele fraction [AF])/(sum of variant AF) in ctDNA (p = 0.044). The total number of alterations detected in plasma by NGS was higher in early resistance patients (p = 0.025). T790 M was lost in 32% of patients (6 out of 19) after acquired resistance to osimertinib. One patient with RB1 deletion and copy number gains of EGFR, PIK3CA, and MYC in addition to T790 M, showed rapid progression due to suspected small cell transformation. CONCLUSIONS NGS of ctDNA could be a promising method for predicting osimertinib efficacy in patients with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR T790 M.","Sueoka-Aragane, Naoko; Nakashima, Chiho; Yoshida, Hironori; Matsumoto, Naohisa; Iwanaga, Kentaro; Ebi, Noriyuki; Nishiyama, Akihiro; Yatera, Kazuhiro; Kuyama, Shoichi; Fukuda, Minoru; Ushijima, Sunao; Umeguchi, Hitomi; Harada, Daijiro; Kashiwabara, Kosuke; Suetsugu, Takayuki; Fujimoto, Nobukazu; Tanaka, Fumihiro; Uramoto, Hidetaka; Yoshii, Chiharu; Nakatomi, Katsumi; Koh, Genju; Seki, Nobuhiko; Aoe, Keisuke; Nosaki, Kaname; Inoue, Koji; Takamori, Ayako; Kawaguchi, Atsushi",Cancer medicine,702,1

Ligand recognition by TLR4 initiates multiple intracellular signaling pathways, leading to production of proinflammatory mediators and type I IFN. Ligand interaction also leads to internalization of the surface receptor complex into lysosomes, leading to the degradation of TLR4 and the termination of LPS response. However, surface level of TLR4 receptor complex is maintained via continuous replenishment of TLR4 from intracellular compartments like Golgi and endosomes. Here we show that continuous replenishment of TLR4 from Golgi to plasma membrane is regulated by the small GTPase Rab10, which is essential for optimal macrophage activation following LPS stimulation. Expression of Rab10 is inducible by LPS. Blockade of Rab10 function leads to decreased membrane TLR4 expression and diminished production of inflammatory cytokines and interferons upon LPS stimulation. These findings suggest that Rab10 expression provides a mechanism to refine TLR4 signaling by regulating the trafficking rate of TLR4 onto the plasma membrane. In addition, we show that altered Rab10 expression in macrophages influences disease severity in an in vivo model of LPS-induced acute lung injury, suggesting Rab10 as a possible therapeutic target for human acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).","Wang, Di; Lou, Jun; Ouyang, Chuan; Chen, Weilin; Liu, Yiqi; Liu, Xinyuan; Cao, Xuetao; Wang, Jianli; Lu, Linrong",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,702,24

No standards exist to characterize shock-absorbing healthcare flooring. This study explores two mechanical tests for impact force reduction and horizontal force required to move wheeled objects. An appropriately designed rubber underlay can reduce peak impact by 25% compared with 1% with standard vinyl. INTRODUCTION Severe falls often occur in hospitals and care homes. Shock-absorbing flooring is one potential solution to prevent fall-related injuries; however, no standards exist for characterizing flooring as an injury prevention measure. Shock-absorbing flooring use in high-risk settings may influence both patients (injury-saving potential) and staff (manoeuvring equipment). We aimed to explore two tests to characterize floors, to determine shock absorbency and horizontal pulling force required to move wheeled objects. METHODS Mechanical testing was performed according to the Canadian Standards Association Z325 Hip Protectors document. This test was developed for hip protectors but is applicable to compliant surfaces that form part of the floor. Tests were performed on commercially available floor materials (suitable for care settings) to assess the force required to initiate movement of a wheeled object across the floor. We explored the relationships between horizontal force required to pull wheeled objects, impact force, floor thickness, and core material. RESULTS Considerable differences were identified between floor samples in their ability to reduce the peak impact force (range 0.7-25%). A peak force reduction of up to 25% can be achieved with a specially designed rubber underlay. Horizontal pulling force increased with floor thickness but was lower for rubber floors. There was no direct relationship between impact attenuation and horizontal pulling force. Whilst thickness and core material explain some variations (66.5% for wheel movement; 82.3% for impact), other unmeasured factors clearly influence floor performance. CONCLUSIONS These results can inform the development of flooring and the establishment of standards needed to underpin practice, research, and development in this field.","Keenan, B E; Hallas, K; Drahota, A K; Evans, S L",Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA,702,1

With depression as a moderating factor for suicide, the need for efficacious treatments for depression has never been more pronounced. Although the armamentarium of the psychiatrist seems impressive having multiple medications and psychotherapy options, with guidelines for combination and augmentation treatments; many patients do not improve or are not suitable candidates for the usual, customary and reasonable (UCR) depression treatments. The use of various forms of brain stimulation technology as a complementary or alternative treatment for depression is growing and is expected to be part of the armamentarium of most psychiatrists by 2030. One form of brain stimulation, available in a phone sized prescription device, is cranial electrical stimulation (CES) which has been used as a treatment for depression since the 1970s. We have conducted two meta-analyses of CES research for depression separating randomized controlled trials (N = 5) from non-randomized studies on interventions (N = 12). For the double-blind RCTs 100 μA was used for 1 hour per day as 100 μA is a subsensory level of current so identical sham treatment devices could be used. METHODS Our literature review followed Cooper's Taxonomy of Literature Reviews that is appropriate for the behavioral and physical sciences and the PRISMA reporting guidelines. The evaluation of strengths and limitations of the research studies included in this report adheres to recommended published guidelines in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and in the Handbook of Research Synthesis and Meta-Analysis. We used the Cohen's d effect size summary metric in all analyses. Homogeneity of effect sizes within the fixed and random effects models are reported. Meta-analyses were performed using the Compressive Meta-Analysis, version 3 program. RESULTS The 5 RCTs represent a combined N of 242 and the 12 NRSIs represent 16 data sets with a combined N of 1173 for total of 1415 subjects across 17 studies. There were male and female subjects, from adolescents to 60 years old. The average effect for the 5 RCTs was calculated as d = -0.69 (i.e., the mean depression level at posttest for the active group was -0.69 standard deviations lower than the mean depression level for the sham group), a medium effect. The additional 12 NRSI studies analyzed show a small effect of d = -0.43 in favor of the active treatment group. CONCLUSION We conclude that CES has a small to medium significant effect in symptoms of depression across moderate to severe patients in civilian, military, veterans, advanced cancer and pediatric populations.","Price, Larry; Briley, Josh; Haltiwanger, Steve; Hitching, Rita",Journal of psychiatric research,702,7

Decisions should be based on patient preferences and the medical indication. The medical indication is mainly the result of an assessment of the patient's prognosis and the applicable therapeutic options. Factors influencing the short term prognosis are mostly the severity of the acute leading disease, the number and severity of other organ failures and the response to initial treatment. Long term prognosis is dominated by the severity and number of comorbidities, age and the resulting frailty. Because in many patients all these informations are not available at the time of admission, in these cases a time-limited trial is often justified to gather all this information before a decision is made.

We performed this technique in 45 patients between March and December 2011. All procedures were completed in single-port approaches. There were no postoperative anastomotic complications such as anastomotic leak and stricture. The median postoperative hospital stay was 7 days. Our technique for intracorporeal Billroth I reconstruction is safe and feasible. This technique could be a useful surgical option in all laparoscopic reconstructive procedures using linear stapling devices.","Omori, Takeshi; Masuzawa, Toru; Akamatsu, Hiroki; Nishida, Toshirou",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,702,17

We conducted a rapid review on how GSSO documentation in EHRs should be modernized to improve the health of SGM. MATERIALS AND METHODS We searched MEDLINE from 2015 to 2020 with terms for gender, sex, sexual orientation, and electronic health/medical records. Only literature reviews, primary studies, and commentaries from peer-reviewed journals in English were included. Two researchers screened citations and reviewed articles with help from a third to reach consensus. Covidence, Excel, and Atlas-TI were used to track articles, extract data, and synthesize findings, respectively. RESULTS Thirty-five articles were included. The 5 themes to modernize GSSO documentation in EHRs were (1) creating an inclusive, culturally competent environment with precise terminology and standardized data collection; (2) refining guidelines for identifying and matching SGM patients with their care needs; (3) improving patient-provider relationships by addressing patient rights and provider competencies; (4) recognizing techno-socio-organizational aspects when implementing GSSO in EHRs; and (5) addressing invisibility of SGM by expanding GSSO research. CONCLUSIONS The literature on GSSO documentation in EHRs is expanding. While this trend is encouraging, there are still knowledge gaps and practical challenges to enabling meaningful changes, such as organizational commitments to ensure affirming environments, and coordinated efforts to address technical, organizational, and social aspects of modernizing GSSO documentation. The adoption of an inclusive EHR to meet SGM needs is a journey that will evolve over time.","Lau, Francis; Antonio, Marcy; Davison, Kelly; Queen, Roz; Devor, Aaron",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,702,1

METHODS A retrospective review was performed in three centers of prospectively collected data of all stroke patients who underwent endovascular therapy using the SOFIA catheter. Patients were enrolled between November 2013 and December 2014. The primary endpoint of the study was accessibility of the thrombus with the SOFIA catheter. As a secondary endpoint, the study assessed recanalization success (Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (TICI) ≥2b). Clinical presentation on admission and discharge was also documented. In addition, catheter- and procedure-related complications (particularly thromboembolic complications) were recorded. RESULTS The SOFIA catheter was used in 115 acute stroke procedures. In 110 cases (96%) the catheter could be advanced to the occlusion site. After mechanical thrombectomy, successful recanalization (TICI ≥2b) was documented in 86.9%. There were no complications related to positioning of the catheter. Distal thrombus migration into a new vascular territory occurred in three patients following thrombectomy with a stent retriever (2.6%). The mean NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on admission was 16.8±6 and at discharge the mean NIHSS score was 8.2±7.7. Sixteen patients died.

The Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) describes personal determinants that play a key role in behavior change. This study investigated whether these determinants are associated with adherence to physical distancing measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 (i.e. keeping 1.5 m physical distance and staying at home). Decreased psychosocial well-being and lack of social support were explored as barriers to adherence. METHODS Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted among adults in Belgium. The first survey (N = 2,379; March 2020) focused on adherence to physical distancing measures. The second survey (N = 805; April 2020) focused on difficulty with, and perseverance in, adhering to these measures. Linear regression models were fitted to examine associations with HAPA determinants, psychosocial well-being, and social support. RESULTS Self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, intention, action planning, and coping planning were related to adhering to, difficulty with, and perseverance in, adhering to physical distancing measures. Decreased psychosocial well-being and lack of social support were related to more difficulties with adhering to physical distancing and lower perseverance. CONCLUSIONS Health action process approach determinants are associated with adherence to physical distancing measures. Future work could design HAPA-based interventions to support people in adhering to these measures.","Beeckman, Melanie; De Paepe, Annick; Van Alboom, Maité; Maes, Sarah; Wauters, Aline; Baert, Fleur; Kissi, Ama; Veirman, Elke; Van Ryckeghem, Dimitri M L; Poppe, Louise",Applied psychology.

The mortality rate for LVFWR is described from 75% to 90% and it is the cause for 20% of in-hospital deaths after AMI. Death results essentially from the limited time available for emergent intervention after onset of symptoms. Emergency surgery is indicated and normally the rupture site is easily identified, but it may not be apparent macroscopically, corresponding to transmyocardial or subepicardial dissection with an external rupture far from the infarction site, or already thrombosed and contained.

However, the role of cellular proteins in DMV formation during virus replication is poorly understood. HCV NS4B protein induces the formation of a ""membranous web"" structure that provides a platform for the assembly of viral replication complexes. Our previous screen of NS4B-associated host membrane proteins by dual-affinity purification, LC-MS/MS, and siRNA methods revealed that Surfeit 4 (Surf4), which encodes an integral membrane protein, involved in the replication of the JFH1 subgenomic replicon. Here, we investigated in detail the effect of Surf4 on HCV replication. Surf4 affects HCV replication in a genotype-independent manner, whereas HCV replication does not alter Surf4 expression. The influence of Surf4 on HCV replication indicates that while Surf4 regulates replication, it has no effect on entry, translation, assembly, or release. Analysis of the underlying mechanism showed that Surf4 is recruited into HCV RNA replication complexes by NS4B and is involved in the formation of DMVs and the structural integrity of RNA replication complexes. Surf4 also participates in the replication of poliovirus, which uses DMVs as replication sites, but has no effect on the replication of dengue virus, which uses invaginated/sphere-type vesicles as replication sites. These findings clearly show that Surf4 as a novel cofactor that is involved in the replication of positive strand RNA viruses using DMVs as RNA replication sites, which provides valuable clues for DMV formation during positive strand RNA virus replication.Importance Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS4B protein induces the formation of a membranous web (MW) structure that provides a platform for the assembly of viral replication complexes. The main constituents of the MW are double membrane vesicles (DMVs). Here, we found that the cellular protein Surf4, which maintains endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartments and the Golgi, is recruited into HCV RNA replication complexes by NS4B and is involved in the formation of DMVs. Moreover, Surf4 participates in the replication of poliovirus, which uses DMVs as replication sites, but has no effect on the replication of dengue virus, which uses invaginated vesicles as replication sites. These results indicate that the cellular protein Surf4 is involved in the replication of positive strand RNA viruses that use DMVs as RNA replication sites, providing new insights into DMV formation during virus replication and potential targets for the diagnosis and treatment of positive strand RNA viruses.","Kong, Lingbao; Aoyagi, Haruyo; Yang, Zibing; Ouyang, Tao; Matsuda, Mami; Fujimoto, Akira; Watashi, Koichi; Suzuki, Ryosuke; Arita, Minetaro; Yamagoe, Satoshi; Dohmae, Naoshi; Suzuki, Takehiro; Suzuki, Tetsuro; Muramatsu, Masamichi; Wakita, Takaji; Aizaki, Hideki",Journal of virology,702,19

Several publications study this effect, however, often using different measures such as: the relative attack rate in case-control studies, the effect on incidence growth/decline in a specific time frame and the effect on the number of infected in a given time frame. These measures all depend on community-specific features and are hence not easily transferred to other community settings. We argue that a more universal measure is the relative reduction in the reproduction number, which we call the face mask effect, E FM. It is shown how to convert the other measures to E FM. We also apply the methodology to four empirical studies using different effect-measures. When converted to estimates of E FM, all estimates lie between 15 and 40%, suggesting that mandatory face masks reduce the reproduction number by an amount in this range, when compared with no individuals wearing face masks. © 2021 The Authors.","Britton, T.","Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences",702,28

Several promising drugs have been identified and are in various stages of clinical trials globally. If efficacy of these drugs is demonstrated, rapid, mass availability at an affordable cost would be essential to ensuring equity and access especially amongst low- and middle-income economies. METHODS: Minimum costs of production were estimated from the costs of active pharmaceutical ingredients using established methodology, which had good predictive accuracy for medicines for hepatitis C and HIV amongst others. Data were extracted from global export shipment records or analysis of the route of chemical synthesis. The estimated costs were compared with list prices from a range of countries where pricing data were available. RESULTS: Minimum estimated costs of production were US $0.93/day for remdesivir, $1.45/day for favipiravir, $0.08/day for hydroxychloroquine, $0.02/day for chloroquine, $0.10/day for azithromycin, $0.28/day for lopinavir/ritonavir, $0.39/day for sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and $1.09/day for pirfenidone. Costs of production ranged between $0.30 and $31 per treatment course (10–28 days). Current prices of these drugs were far higher than the costs of production, particularly in the US. CONCLUSIONS: Should repurposed drugs demonstrate efficacy against COVID-19, they could be manufactured profitably at very low costs, for much less than current list prices. Estimations for the minimum production costs can strengthen price negotiations and help ensure affordable access to vital treatment for COVID-19 at low prices globally.","Hill, Andrew; Wang, Junzheng; Levi, Jacob; Heath, Katie; Fortunak, Joseph",,702,1

MHV-specific serum IgG antibody titers were measured with an enzyme immunoassay, using MHV-S-infected 17 Cl 1 cells as antigen. Lesions were first detectable at 2 days and were most severe in 1-week-old mice and more severe in BALB mice, compared with SJL mice of the same age. Additional BALB mice inoculated at the age of 24 hours developed severe necrotizing enterocolitis, whereas SJL mice inoculated at the age of 24 hours developed lesions equivalent to those in 1-week-old BALB mice. Virus was first detectable at 2 days and virus titers were highest at 2, 3, and 5 days, then diminished on days 10, 20, and 30.

In this study, the intracellular formation of the prM-E complex of Japanese encephalitis virus was investigated by baculovirus coexpression of prM and E in trans in Sf9 insect cells as analyzed by anti-E antibody immunoprecipitation and sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis. A series of carboxyl-terminally truncated prM mutant baculoviruses was constructed to demonstrate that the truncations of the transmembrane (TM) region resulted in a reduction of the formation of the stable prM-E complex by approximately 40% for the TM1 (at residues 130 to 147 [prM130-147]) truncation and 20% for TM2 (at prM153-167) truncation. Alanine-scanning site-directed mutagenesis on the prM99-103 region indicated that the His99 residue was the critical prM binding element for stable prM-E heterodimeric complex formation. The single amino acid mutation at the His99 residue of prM abolishing the prM-E interaction was not due to reduced expression or different subcellular location of the mutant prM protein involved in prM-E interactions as characterized by pulse-chase labeling and confocal scanning microscopic analysis. Recombinant subviral particles were detected in the Sf9 cell culture supernatants by baculovirus coexpression of prM and E proteins but not with the prM H99A mutant. Sequence alignment analysis was further conducted with different groups of flaviviruses to show that the prM H99 residues are generally conserved. Our findings are the first report to characterize the minimum binding elements of the prM protein that are involved in prM-E interactions of flaviviruses. This information, concerning a molecular framework for the prM protein, is considered to elucidate the structure/function relationship of the prM-E complex synthesis and provide the proper trajectory for flavivirus assembly and maturation.","Lin, Ying-Ju; Wu, Suh-Chin",Journal of virology,702,33

Because interleukin-18 (IL-18) mediates T helper 1 driven immune responses, and since mature IL-18 is up-regulated in human macrophages after influenza virus infection in vitro, it has been suggested that IL-18 plays an important role in the immune response to influenza. To determine the role of IL-18 in respiratory tract infection with influenza, IL-18 gene-deficient (IL-18(-/-)) and normal wildtype mice were intranasally inoculated with influenza A virus. Influenza resulted in an increase in constitutively expressed IL-18 in the lungs of wildtype mice. The clearance of influenza A was inhibited by IL-18, as indicated by reduced viral loads on day 8 and day 12 after infection in IL-18(-/-) mice. This enhanced viral clearance correlated with increased CD4(+) T-cell activation in the lungs as reflected by CD69 expression on the cell surface. Surprisingly, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) levels were similar in the lungs of IL-18(-/-) mice and wildtype mice. Intracellular IFN-gamma staining revealed similar expression levels in lung-derived natural killer cells, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, indicating that IFN-gamma production is IL-18-independent during influenza virus infection. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha production by CD4(+) T cells was significantly lower in IL-18(-/-) mice than in wildtype mice. Our data indicate that endogenous IL-18 impairs viral clearance during influenza A infection.","Van Der Sluijs, Koenraad F; Van Elden, Leontine J R; Arens, Ramon; Nijhuis, Monique; Schuurman, Rob; Florquin, Sandrine; Kwakkel, Joan; Akira, Shizuo; Jansen, Henk M; Lutter, René; Van Der Polls, Tom",Immunology,702,31

However, the key to RNA interference is the efficient intracellular delivery of the siRNA. In this study, we sought to enhance the efficiency of transduction and find a novel therapy for hepatic carcinoma. METHODS Three types of neuroepithelial transforming protein 1 (NET-1) siRNAs (labeled fluorescent) were designed and transduced into HepG2 cells. Then the most effective one in silencing NET-1 was determined. The HepG2 cells were divided into 5 groups: untreated control; delivery of siRNA; delivery of siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA; group L); delivery of siRNA using ultrasound exposure and microbubbles (group US); and delivery of siRNA using Lipofectamine, ultrasound exposure, and microbubbles (group LUS). The efficiency of siRNA transfer was determined by detection of luciferase activity on microscopy; NET-1 expression was assayed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting; and proliferation investigations of the HepG2 cells were performed. RESULTS- The transfection efficiency of microbubbles combined with ultrasound exposure was nearly equal to Lipofectamine-mediated transfection (P = .609). More importantly, the combination of Lipofectamine, microbubbles, and ultrasound exposure effectively reduced NET-1 expression compared with the other groups (P < .01). Furthermore, the proliferation of cells in groups L, US, and LUS was visibly inhibited between 24 and 72 hours. CONCLUSIONS The use of a microbubble contrast agent combined with ultrasound exposure could be a potent physical method for increasing gene delivery efficiency. This technique is a promising nonviral approach that can be used in liver cancer.","Han, Xue; Cheng, Wen; Jing, Hui; Zhang, Jiu-Wei; Tang, Li-Li",Journal of ultrasound in medicine : official journal of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine,702,5

A clinical isolate of the virus introduced intranasally replicated transiently to high levels in the lungs of these mice, with a peak on day 3 and clearance by day 9 postinfection. Viral RNA localized to bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium. Expression of mRNA for angiotensin converting enzyme 2, the SARS-CoV receptor, was detected in the lung following infection. The virus induced production in the lung of the proinflammatory chemokines CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10 with differential kinetics. The receptors for these chemokines were also detected. Most impressively, mRNA for CXCR3, the receptor for CXCL9 and CXCL10, was massively up-regulated in the lungs of SARS-CoV-infected mice. Surprisingly Th1 (and Th2) cytokines were not detectable, and there was little local accumulation of leukocytes and no obvious clinical signs of pulmonary dysfunction. Moreover, beige, CD1-/-, and RAG1-/- mice cleared the virus normally. Infection spread to the brain as it was cleared from the lung, again without leukocyte accumulation. Infected mice had a relative failure to thrive, gaining weight significantly more slowly than uninfected mice. These data indicate that C57BL/6 mice support transient nonfatal systemic infection with SARS-CoV in the lung, which is able to disseminate to brain. In this species, proinflammatory chemokines may coordinate a rapid and highly effective innate antiviral response in the lung, but NK cells and adaptive cellular immunity are not required for viral clearance.","Glass, William G; Subbarao, Kanta; Murphy, Brian; Murphy, Philip M",Journal of immunology,702,24

Gaps exist in our understanding of how esophageal pressure (and therefore Ptp), a value measured at a single site, responds when respiratory system compartments are asymmetrically affected by whole-lung atelectasis or unilateral injury as well as changes in chest wall compliance. We reasoned that Ptp would track with aerated volume changes as estimated by functional residual capacity (FRC) and tidal volume. We examined this hypothesis in the setting of asymmetric lungs and changes in intra-abdominal pressure. METHODS This study was conducted in the animal laboratory of a university-affiliated hospital. Models of unilateral atelectasis and unilateral and bilateral lung injury exposed to intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) in 10 deeply sedated mechanically ventilated swine. Atelectasis was created by balloon occlusion of the left main bronchus. Unilateral lung injury was induced by saline lavage of isolated right lung. Diffuse lung injury was induced by saline lavage of both lungs. The peritoneum was insufflated with air to create a model of pressure-regulated IAH. We measured esophageal pressures, airway pressures, FRC by gas dilution, and oxygenation. RESULTS FRC was reduced by IAH in normal lungs (P < .001) and both asymmetric lung pathologies (P < .001). Ptp at end-expiration was decreased by IAH in bilateral (P = .001) and unilateral lung injury (P = .003) as well as unilateral atelectasis (P = .019). In the setting of both lung injury models, end-expiratory Ptp showed a moderate correlation in tracking with FRC. CONCLUSIONS Ptp tracks with aerated lung volume in the setting of thoracic asymmetry and changes in intra-abdominal pressure. However, used alone, it cannot distinguish the relative contributions of air-space distention and recruitment of lung units.","Keenan, Joseph C; Cortes-Puentes, Gustavo A; Adams, Alexander B; Dries, David J; Marini, John J",Respiratory care,702,28

Despite multiple case-series, actionable knowledge to tailor decision-making proactively is missing. RESEARCH QUESTION: Can a statistical model accurately predict infection with COVID-19? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We developed a prospective registry of all patients tested for COVID-19 in Cleveland Clinic to create individualized risk prediction models. We focus here on the likelihood of a positive nasal or oropharyngeal COVID-19 test. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression algorithm was constructed that removed variables that were not contributing to the model's cross-validated concordance index. After external validation in a temporally and geographically distinct cohort, the statistical prediction model was illustrated as a nomogram and deployed in an online risk calculator. RESULTS: In the development cohort, 11,672 patients fulfilled study criteria, including 818 patients (7.0%) who tested positive for COVID-19; in the validation cohort, 2295 patients fulfilled criteria, including 290 patients who tested positive for COVID-19. Male, African American, older patients, and those with known COVID-19 exposure were at higher risk of being positive for COVID-19. Risk was reduced in those who had pneumococcal polysaccharide or influenza vaccine or who were on melatonin, paroxetine, or carvedilol.

We aimed to assess the extent of COVID-19 pulmonary abnormalities on chest x-ray (CXR) using a semiquantitative severity score, correlating it with clinical data and testing its interobserver agreement. METHODS: From February 22 to April 8, 2020, 926 consecutive patients referring to ED of two institutions in Northern Italy for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were reviewed. Patients with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction positive for SARS-CoV-2 and CXR images on ED admission were included (295 patients, median age 69 years, 199 males). Five readers independently and blindly reviewed all CXRs, rating pulmonary parenchymal involvement using a 0-3 semiquantitative score in 1-point increments on 6 lung zones (range 0-18). Interobserver agreement was assessed with weighted Cohen's &#954;, correlations between median CXR score and clinical data with Spearman's &#961;, and the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Median score showed negative correlation with SpO2 (&#961; = -0.242, p < 0.001), positive correlation with white cell count (&#961; = 0.277, p < 0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (&#961; = 0.308, p < 0.001), and C-reactive protein (&#961; = 0.367, p < 0.001), being significantly higher in subsequently dead patients (p = 0.003).

Importantly, we find several epitopes on the S protein that elicit neutralizing antibodies against D614 and G614 SARS-CoV-2, which can contribute to vaccine design against coronaviruses.","Lu, Shuai; Xie, Xi-Xiu; Zhao, Lei; Wang, Bin; Zhu, Jie; Yang, Ting-Rui; Yang, Guang-Wen; Ji, Mei; Lv, Cui-Ping; Xue, Jian; Dai, Er-Hei; Fu, Xi-Ming; Liu, Dong-Qun; Zhang, Lun; Hou, Sheng-Jie; Yu, Xiao-Lin; Wang, Yu-Ling; Gao, Hui-Xia; Shi, Xue-Han; Ke, Chang-Wen; Ke, Bi-Xia; Jiang, Chun-Guo; Liu, Rui-Tian",Cell Rep,702,16

The current state-of-the-art deep learning models for detection of COVID-19 are heavy models that may not be easy to deploy in commonly utilized mobile platforms in point-of-care testing. In this work, we develop a lightweight mobile friendly efficient deep learning model for detection of COVID-19 using lung US images. Three different classes including COVID-19, pneumonia, and healthy were included in this task. The developed network, named as Mini-COVIDNet, was bench-marked with other lightweight neural network models along with state-of-the-art heavy model. It was shown that the proposed network can achieve the highest accuracy of 83.2% and requires a training time of only 24 min. The proposed Mini-COVIDNet has 4.39 times less number of parameters in the network compared to its next best performing network and requires a memory of only 51.29 MB, making the point-of-care detection of COVID-19 using lung US imaging plausible on a mobile platform. Deployment of these lightweight networks on embedded platforms shows that the proposed Mini-COVIDNet is highly versatile and provides optimal performance in terms of being accurate as well as having latency in the same order as other lightweight networks. The developed lightweight models are available at https://github.com/navchetan-awasthi/Mini-COVIDNet.","Awasthi, Navchetan; Dayal, Aveen; Cenkeramaddi, Linga Reddy; Yalavarthy, Phaneendra K",IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control,702,29

Because of the COVID-19 infection, the lockdown was introduced, but the effects on preschool wheezers are unknown. We hypothesized that there would be an improvement in outcomes during the lockdown, and these would be lost when the lockdown was eased. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients underwent medical visits before and after the COVID-19 lockdown. We recorded the childhood Asthma Control Test (cACT) and a clinical questionnaire. Data on symptoms, the need for medications and the use of healthcare resources were recorded. We compared these data with retrospective reports from the preceding year and prospectively acquired questionnaires after lockdown. RESULTS: We studied 85 preschool wheezers, mean age 4.9 years. During the lockdown, cACT score was significantly higher (median 25 vs. 23); families reported a dramatic drop in wheezing episodes (51 vs. none), significant reductions in the day and nighttime symptoms, including episodes of shortness of breath (p < .0001); the use of salbutamol and oral corticosteroids (OCS) dropped significantly (p < .0001) and 79 (95%) patients needed no OCS bursts during the lockdown. Finally, patients had significantly fewer extra medical examinations, as well as fewer Emergency Room visits (p < .0001). All were improved compared with the same time period from the previous year, but outcomes worsened significantly again after lockdown (cACT median: 22). CONCLUSIONS: During the national lockdown, children with persistent preschool wheeze showed a significant clinical improvement with reduction of respiratory symptoms, medication use for exacerbations, and use of healthcare resources. This trend reversed when lockdown restrictions were eased.","Ullmann, Nicola; Allegorico, Annalisa; Bush, Andrew; Porcaro, Federica; Negro, Valentina; Onofri, Alessandro; Cherchi, Claudio; De Santis, Simone; Rosito, Lorenza; Cutrera, Renato",Pediatr. pulmonol,702,16

Vitamin D had recently been reviewed as one of the factors that may affect the severity in COVID-19. The objective of current study is to analyze the vitamin D level in COVID-19 patients and its impact on the disease severity. After approval from Ethics Committee, M.L.B Medical College the current study was undertaken as continuous prospective observational study of 6 weeks. Participants were COVID-19 patients of age group 30-60 years admitted during the study period of 6 weeks. Study included either asymptomatic COVID-19 patients (Group A) or severely ill patients requiring ICU admission (Group B). Serum concentration of 25 (OH)D, were measured along with serum IL-6; TNF&#945; and serum ferritin. Standard statistical analysis was performed to analyze the differences. Current Study enrolled 154 patients, 91 in Group A and 63 patients in Group B. The mean level of vitamin D (in ng/mL) was 27.89 ± 6.21 in Group A and 14.35 ± 5.79 in Group B, the difference was highly significant. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 32.96% and 96.82% respectively in Group A and Group B. Out of total 154 patients, 90 patients were found to be deficient in vitamin D (Group A: 29; Group B: 61). Serum level of inflammatory markers was found to be higher in vitamin D deficient COVID-19 patients viz. IL-6 level (in pg/mL) 19.34 ± 6.17 vs 12.18 ± 4.29; Serum ferritin 319.17 ± 38.21 ng/mL vs 186.83 ± 20.18 ng/mL; TNF&#945; level (in pg/mL) 13.26 ± 5.64 vs 11.87 ± 3.15. The fatality rate was high in vitamin D deficient (21% vs 3.1%). Vitamin D level is markedly low in severe COVID-19 patients. Inflammatory response is high in vitamin D deficient COVID-19 patients. This all translates into increased mortality in vitamin D deficient COVID-19 patients. As per the flexible approach in the current COVID-19 pandemic authors recommend mass administration of vitamin D supplements to population at risk for COVID-19.","Jain, Anshul; Chaurasia, Rachna; Sengar, Narendra Singh; Singh, Mayank; Mahor, Sachin; Narain, Sumit",Sci Rep,702,16

METHODS: Hospital and ED data were drawn from California's Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD). DV-related hospitalizations and ED visits in California were analyzed between January 2000 and September 2015 (53,596), along with total medical costs. Time series were divided into pre-recession (Jan 2000-Nov 2007) and recession/post-recession (Dec 2007-Sept 2015) periods. RESULTS: The medical cost of DV-related hospitalizations alone was estimated as $1,136,165,861. A dramatic increase in DV episodes was found potentially associated with the Great Recession. The number of ED visits per month tripled from pre- to post-recession (104.9 vs. 290.6), along with an increased number of hospitalizations (77.1 vs. 95.6); African Americans and Native Americans were disproportionally impacted. In addition, psychiatric comorbidities, severe DV episodes, in-hospital mortality and charge per hospitalization escalated. The rise in DV hospitalizations and ED visits beginning in December 2007 was mainly attributable to physical abuse episodes in adults; minors had no change in DV trends. DISCUSSION: Recessions are frequent in modern economies and are repeated cyclically. Our study provides critical information on the effects of the 2007 financial crisis on DV-related healthcare service utilization in California. Given the current financial crisis associated with COVID-19, which expert predict could extend for years, the results from this study shine a spotlight on the importance of DV-related screening, prevention and response.","Medel-Herrero, Alvaro; Shumway, Martha; Smiley-Jewell, Suzette; Bonomi, Amy; Reidy, Dennis",Prev Med,702,16

Phylogenetic analysis confirms that SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV at the level of the viral genome. RNAseq analyses demonstrate that human lung epithelial cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection are distinct. Extensive Gene Expression Omnibus literature screening and drug predictive analyses show that SARS-CoV-2 infection response pathways are closely related to those of SARS-CoV and respiratory syncytial virus infections. We validated SARS-CoV-2 infection response genes as disease-associated using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates in lung disease patient data.

This is reflected in trade flows but also affects the conditions for conducting dispersed production functions across countries. This ""new normal"" period presents the need to examine the main problems/challenges in international trade and business. Purpose: The article aims to establish the scope, aspects and implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on international trade and on international production by reviewing recent articles which deal with international trade and global value chain (GVC) issues, changes that were already taking place and the challenges that began in 2020. Methods and approach: The findings of recent articles on trade flows and changes in GVCs (mainly the period 2019-2021) are described in theoretical terms, compared and systematically reviewed. Special focus is given to the impact of the pandemic on GVCs, re-nationalization and GVCs and the impact of the pandemic on GVC governance, and GVCs in the production of vaccines for the COVID-19 virus. Findings: Trade recorded a drop in 2020, accompanied with the introduction of protective trade policy measures. Reduced GVC activities had a negative impact on welfare and the ""re-nationalization"" of GVC-related activities is not a real solution. For the development of GVCs it is important to find a trade-off between efficiency and resilience, starting with re-organization (re-engineering) of GVCs, and probably focusing on regional frameworks. Liberal trade policies are essential to ensure the involvement of GVCs in producing the COVID-19 vaccines since the various inputs are produced in different countries. Policy implications: The possible directions for the future development of GVCs are elaborated: re-shoring, resilience in supply chains, adjustments in governance, diversification and development of risk-management strategies. The process of internationalization is not in question, but presents challenges which create the need for adjustments in its future development. Current problems with vaccine production arise in part from imposed trade barriers and rising nationalism. There is a need for greater cross-country co-operation to avoid placing national short-term interests before long-term and broader objectives.","Kersan-Skabic, Ines",Development policy review,702,24

In oncology, the biggest questions concern interaction of COVID-19 with pre-existing cancer disease and with systemic anticancer treatments. With regards to immunotherapy, there is uncertainty about its effect in the context of COVID-19 in terms of probability and course of viral infection. Herein, we retrospectively report data of patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) treated with immunotherapy at five Italian referral cancer centers during the pandemic. cSCC is a disease poorly represented in the literature, typically affecting fragile, elderly patients, with multiple comorbidities and often immunosuppressed. Overall, 54 patients were identified, most of them coming from Lombardy and Piedmont, the two regions hit hardest by COVID in Italy. In most cases, our choice was to continue treatment, reserving temporary interruptions only to patients considered particularly at risk for age and comorbidity. A total of 9% of patients developed new-onset symptoms or had chest radiological assessment potentially related to COVID-19. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected in all suspicious cases and two hospitalized patients were found to be positive. In conclusion, the outbreak of COVID-19 is a major worldwide health concern. Our data indicate that COVID-19 mortality in patients with cancer may be principally driven by advancing age, the presence of other comorbidities, and other cancer-related conditions (i.e. hospitalization). Our data further suggests the safety of continued use of PD-1 blockade during the COVID-19 pandemic (obviously implementing all the safety measures in the hospital environment) also considering the possible negative effects of a prolonged suspension on the course of the tumor evolution. We think it is useful to collect and report case studies coming from reference centers, because they can represent helpful examples for the scientific community of clinical management of patients affected by cancer in this difficult period and guide further research.","Saponara, Maristella; Pala, Laura; Conforti, Fabio; Rubatto, Marco; De Risi, Ivana; Spagnolo, Francesco; Guida, Michele; Bossi, Paolo; Quaglino, Pietro; Queirolo, Paola",Ther Adv Med Oncol,702,12
