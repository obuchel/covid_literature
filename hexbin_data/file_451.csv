1090,"Vaccination to Conserved Influenza Antigens in Mice Using a Novel Simian Adenovirus Vector, PanAd3, Derived from the Bonobo Pan paniscus",2013-03-11,"Among approximately 1000 adenoviruses from chimpanzees and bonobos studied recently, the Pan Adenovirus type 3 (PanAd3, isolated from a bonobo, Pan paniscus) has one of the best profiles for a vaccine vector, combining potent transgene immunogenicity with minimal pre-existing immunity in the human population. In this study, we inserted into a replication defective PanAd3 a transgene expressing a fusion protein of conserved influenza antigens nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix 1 (M1). We then studied antibody and T cell responses as well as protection from challenge infection in a mouse model. A single intranasal administration of PanAd3-NPM1 vaccine induced strong antibody and T cell responses, and protected against high dose lethal influenza virus challenge. Thus PanAd3 is a promising candidate vector for vaccines, including universal influenza vaccines.","Vitelli, Alessandra; Quirion, Mary R.; Lo, Chia-Yun; Misplon, Julia A.; Grabowska, Agnieszka K.; Pierantoni, Angiolo; Ammendola, Virginia; Price, Graeme E.; Soboleski, Mark R.; Cortese, Riccardo; Colloca, Stefano; Nicosia, Alfredo; Epstein, Suzanne L.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3594242/,451
2548,Quantitative Fluorescence Quenching on Antibody-conjugated Graphene Oxide as a Platform for Protein Sensing,2017-01-13,"We created an immunosensing platform for the detection of proteins in a buffer solution. Our sensing platform relies on graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets conjugated with antibodies to provide quantitative binding sites for analyte proteins. When analyte proteins and standard fluorescein-labelled proteins are competing for the binding sites, the assay exhibits quantitative fluorescence quenching by GO for the fluorescein-labelled proteins as determined by the analyte protein concentration. Because of this mechanism, measured fluorescence intensity from unquenched fluorescein-labelled protein was shown to increase with an increasing analyte protein concentration. As an alternative to the conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), our method does not require an enzyme-linked second antibody for protein recognition and the enzyme for optical signal measurement. Thus, it is beneficial with its low cost and fewer systematic errors caused by the series of antigen-antibody recognition steps in ELISA. Immune globulin G (IgG) was introduced as a model protein to test our method and our results showed that the limit of detection for IgG was 4.67 pmol mL(−1) in the buffer solution. This sensing mechanism could be developed into a promising biosensor for the detection of proteins, which would broaden the spectrum of GO applications in both analytical biochemistry and clinical diagnosis.","Huang, Ao; Li, Weiwei; Shi, Shuo; Yao, Tianming",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5233999/,451
2663,Toxicity of nano- and ionic silver to embryonic stem cells: a comparative toxicogenomic study,2017-04-11,"BACKGROUND: The widespread application of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and silver-containing products has raised public safety concerns about their adverse effects on human health and the environment. To date, in vitro toxic effects of AgNPs and ionic silver (Ag(+)) on many somatic cell types are well established. However, no studies have been conducted hitherto to evaluate their effect on cellular transcriptome in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). RESULTS: The present study characterized transcriptomic changes induced by 5.0 µg/ml AgNPs during spontaneous differentiation of mouse ESCs, and compared them to those induced by Ag(+) under identical conditions. After 24 h exposure, 101 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in AgNP-treated cells, whereas 400 genes responded to Ag(+). Despite the large differences in the numbers of DEGs, functional annotation and pathway analysis of the regulated genes revealed overall similarities between AgNPs and Ag(+). In both cases, most of the functions and pathways impacted fell into two major categories, embryonic development and metabolism. Nevertheless, a number of canonical pathways related to cancer were found for Ag(+) but not for AgNPs. Conversely, it was noted that several members of the heat shock protein and the metallothionein families were upregulated by AgNPs but not Ag(+), suggesting specific oxidative stress effect of AgNPs in ESCs. The effects of AgNPs on oxidative stress and downstream apoptosis were subsequently confirmed by flow cytometry analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the results presented in the current study demonstrate that both AgNPs and Ag(+) caused transcriptomic changes that could potentially exert an adverse effect on development. Although transcriptomic responses to AgNPs and Ag(+) were substantially similar, AgNPs exerted specific effects on ESCs due to their nanosized particulate form.

4599,Surface Dielectric Barrier Discharge plasma: a suitable measure against fungal plant pathogens,2020-02-28,"BACKGROUND: Among all cases of nosocomial pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus is the second most prevalent pathogen (17.8%). In Europe, 29.9% of the isolates are oxacillin-resistant. The changing epidemiology of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) nosocomial infections and the decreasing susceptibility to first-line antibiotics leave clinicians with few therapeutic options. The objective of our study was to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility, the associated molecular mechanisms of resistance and the epidemiological relatedness of MRSA strains isolated from the endotracheal tubes (ETT) of intubated critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with nosocomial pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS: The antimicrobial susceptibility to vancomycin, linezolid, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, fusidic acid, gentamicin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, rifampicin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and tetracycline were measured. Resistance mechanisms were then analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Molecular epidemiology was carried out by multi-locus sequence typing. RESULTS: S. aureus isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, clindamycin, and fusidic acid. The most frequent mutations in quinolone-resistant S. aureus strains were S84L in the gyrA gene, V511A in the gyrB gene, S144P in the grlA gene, and K401R/E in the grlB gene. Strains resistant to erythromycin carried the ermC, ermA, and msrA genes; the same ermC and ermA genes were detected in strains resistant to clindamycin. The aac(6′)-aph(2″) gene was related to gentamicin resistance, while resistance to tetracycline was related to tetK (efflux pump). The fusB gene was detected in the strain resistant to fusidic acid. The most frequent sequence types were ST22, ST8, and ST217, which were distributed in four clonal complexes (CC5, CC22, CC45, and CC59). CONCLUSIONS: High levels of resistance to second-line antimicrobials threatens the treatment of nosocomial respiratory infections due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus with decreased susceptibility to linezolid and vancomycin. The wide genotypic diversity found reinforces the central role of ICU infection control in preventing nosocomial transmission.","Cabrera, Roberto; Fernández-Barat, Laia; Motos, Anna; López-Aladid, Rubén; Vázquez, Nil; Panigada, Mauro; Álvarez-Lerma, Francisco; López, Yuly; Muñoz, Laura; Castro, Pedro; Vila, Jordi; Torres, Antoni",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7049205/,451

The starting point is bioethics. The debate about public health ethics is simultaneously a debate about an adequate identity of public health, its goals, tasks and standards. In Germany there is a tremendous need to take part in this discourse. German experiences within the traditions of social medicine, social hygiene and medical ethics could significantly contribute to the international discussion. Unfortunately the German speaking public health community has hardly acknowledged the topic of ethics. The reasons for this are not explicitly known. The Angloamerican discourse is much more developed, but the concepts, terms and paradigms should not simply be transferred.

The first case (a 10-year-old boy) had unusual initial presentation of JDM complicated with interstitial lung disease documented with high-resolution computed tomography. He had a rapidly progressive course and died in 7 weeks after the onset of the disease despite steroid and immunosuppressive treatment. The second case (a 14-year-old boy) was presented with myositis complicated with hepatitis. He also had a chronic course of JDM with unfavorable outcome.

11776,Targeting the C-Terminal Domain Small Phosphatase 1,2020-05-08,"Although the elongating ribosome is an efficient helicase, certain mRNA stem-loop structures are known to impede ribosome movement along mRNA and stimulate programmed ribosome frameshifting via mechanisms that are not well understood. Using biochemical and single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments, we studied how frameshift-inducing stem-loops from E. coli dnaX mRNA and the gag-pol transcript of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) perturb translation elongation. We find that upon encountering the ribosome, the stem-loops strongly inhibit A-site tRNA binding and ribosome intersubunit rotation that accompanies translation elongation. Electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) reveals that the HIV stem-loop docks into the A site of the ribosome. Our results suggest that mRNA stem-loops can transiently escape the ribosome helicase by binding to the A site. Thus, the stem-loops can modulate gene expression by sterically hindering tRNA binding and inhibiting translation elongation.","Bao, Chen; Loerch, Sarah; Ling, Clarence; Korostelev, Andrei A; Grigorieff, Nikolaus; Ermolenko, Dmitri N",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7282821/,451
11865,The Beneficial Effects of Neuraminidase Inhibitor Drug Therapy on Severe Patient Outcomes During the 2009–2010 Influenza A Virus Subtype H1N1 Pandemic,2013-02-15,"This study looks at public awareness and understanding of the Spanish flu in the United States between June 1918, when the flu became “Spanish,” and the end of September when the deadly second wave reached the majority of the country. Based on an extensive reading of local newspapers, it finds a near universal lack of preparation or panic or other signs of personal concern among those in the unaffected areas, despite extensive and potentially worrying coverage of the flu's progress. The normal reaction to news of the inexorable approach of a pandemic of uncertain virulence is anxiety and action. The Spanish flu produced neither in the uninfected areas for a month. The most likely reason appears to be cognitive inertia—the tendency of existing beliefs or habits of thought to blind people to changed realities. This inertia grew out of the widespread understanding of flu as a seasonal visitor that while frequently unpleasant almost never killed the strong and otherwise healthy. This view of the flu was powerful enough that it blinded many in the unaffected regions to the threat for weeks even in the face of daily or near daily coverage of the pandemic's spread.","Dicke, Tom",J Hist Med Allied Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7313928/,451
15157,Diagnostic accuracy and utility of SARS-CoV-2 antigen lateral flow assays in medical admissions with possible COVID-19,2021-02-01,"BACKGROUND: Intensive care unit-acquired weakness syndrome (ICUAWS) can be a consequence of long-term mechanical ventilation. Despite recommendations of early patient mobilisation, little is known about the feasibility, safety and benefit of interval training in early rehabilitation facilities (ERF) after long-term invasive ventilation. METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively analysed two established training protocols of bicycle ergometry in ERF patients after long-term (> 7 days) invasive ventilation (n = 46). Patients conducted moderate continuous (MCT, n = 24, mean age 70.3 ± 10.1 years) or high-intensity interval training (HIIT, n = 22, mean age 63.6 ± 12.6 years). The intensity of training was monitored with the BORG CR10 scale (intense phases ≥ 7/10 and moderate phases ≤ 4/10 points). The primary outcome was improvement (∆-values) of six-minute-walk-test (6 MWT), while the secondary outcomes were improvement of vital capacity (VC(max)), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)), maximal inspiratory pressure (PI(max)) and functional capabilities (functional independence assessment measure, FIM/FAM and Barthel scores) after 3 weeks of training. No adverse events were observed. There was a trend towards a greater improvement of 6 MWT in HIIT than MCT (159.5 ± 64.9 m vs. 120.4 ± 60.4 m; p = .057), despite more days of invasive ventilation (39.6 ± 16.8 days vs. 26.8 ± 16.2 days; p = .009). VC(max) (∆0.5l ± 0.6 vs. ∆0.5l ± 0.3; p = .462), FEV(1) (∆0.2l ± 0.3 vs. ∆0.3l ± 0.2; p = .218) PI(max) (∆0.8 ± 1.1 kPa vs. ∆0.7 ± 1.3pts; p = .918) and functional status (FIM/FAM: ∆29.0 ± 14.8pts vs. ∆30.9 ± 16.0pts; p = .707; Barthel: ∆28.9 ± 16.0 pts vs. ∆25.0 ± 10.5pts; p = .341) improved in HIIT and MCT. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the feasibility and safety of HIIT in the early rehabilitation of ICUAWS patients. Larger trials are necessary to find adequate dosage of HIIT in ICUAWS patients.

21608,Feasibility of a Combined Mobile-Health Electrocardiographic and Rapid Diagnostic Test Screening for Chagas-Related Cardiac Alterations,2021-09-06,"In econophysics, the achievements of information filtering methods over the past 20 years, such as the minimal spanning tree (MST) by Mantegna and the planar maximally filtered graph (PMFG) by Tumminello et al., should be celebrated. Here, we show how one can systematically improve upon this paradigm along two separate directions. First, we used topological data analysis (TDA) to extend the notions of nodes and links in networks to faces, tetrahedrons, or k-simplices in simplicial complexes. Second, we used the Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC) to acquire geometric information that cannot be provided by simple information filtering. In this sense, MSTs and PMFGs are but first steps to revealing the topological backbones of financial networks. This is something that TDA can elucidate more fully, following which the ORC can help us flesh out the geometry of financial networks. We applied these two approaches to a recent stock market crash in Taiwan and found that, beyond fusions and fissions, other non-fusion/fission processes such as cavitation, annihilation, rupture, healing, and puncture might also be important. We also successfully identified neck regions that emerged during the crash, based on their negative ORCs, and performed a case study on one such neck region.","Yen, Peter Tsung-Wen; Xia, Kelin; Cheong, Siew Ann",Entropy (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8467365/,451

In these studies, the method is applied for game level design. The goal of conducted research was the analysis of space perception in successive design phases related to the process of game environment formation. Next steps of the design process define the space burdened with more and more information. It aims to evaluate if initial assumptions, made by a designer at the beginning of the designing process, are maintained with the increase in the number of details and the content of locations. These studies are also a background for research in automation of visual diversity assessment. This, in turn, is related to making a player focused and interested during a gameplay, by the means of space defining an action scene.

Verification of such hyperproperties is extremely challenging because they involve simultaneous reasoning about an unbounded number of different traces. In this paper, we introduce a technique for verifying quantitative hyperproperties based on the notion of trace enumeration relations. These relations allow us to reduce the problem of trace-counting into one of model-counting of formulas in first-order logic. We also introduce a set of inference rules for machine-checked reasoning about the number of satisfying solutions to first-order formulas (aka model counting). Putting these two components together enables semi-automated verification of quantitative hyperproperties on infinite-state systems. We use our methodology to prove confidentiality of access patterns in Path ORAMs of unbounded size, soundness of a simple interactive zero-knowledge proof protocol as well as other applications of quantitative hyperproperties studied in past work.","Sahai, Shubham; Subramanyan, Pramod; Sinha, Rohit",Computer Aided Verification,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7363233/,451

The non-ideal cosine response of a detector may lead to errors in irradiance measurements. In this paper, a theoretical simulation of irradiance generated due to isotropic point light sources is carried out for different illumination conditions. Simulation results show that the errors in irradiance measurements due to the cosine error of detectors become significantly high at the edges and corners of the floor when a light source is placed at the center of the roof. Further, it is observed that the errors are more in the enclosures having a height smaller than the floor dimensions. Even calibrated detectors measure erratic values of irradiance for a wider angle of incidence. Therefore, cosine errors in irradiance measurements are of great importance especially during the current scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic, for ensuring the correct dose of Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation (UVGI).","Vijeta; Kapri, Rashtrapriya Kumar; Saha, Shibu; Jaiswal, V.

OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to compare the outcomes and the severity of bronchiolitis in young children with multiple simultaneous respiratory virus infections to those with single virus infection and no virus identified group. METHODS: Patients with moderate and severe bronchiolitis who visited our emergency department between November 2016 and May 2017 had nasopharyngeal swab samples results tested by multiplex polymerase chain reaction were included in the study. Patients’ characteristics, clinical severity of illness, and outcome (pediatric emergency department discharge, admission to ward or pediatric intensive care unit) were compared with the detected viral agents. RESULTS: A total of 241 patients were included in the study. The mean age was 7.8 ± 2.6 months and 147 (61%) were male. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most common detected viral agent in 108 (39%) cases followed by human rhinoviruses in 67 (24%). Respiratory syncytial virus was found more frequently in February and March (p = 0.002). Leukocytosis and pneumonia were more likely observed in patients with only human rhinoviruses (+) subjects (p = 0.010 and p = 0.015, respectively). Intensive care hospitalization rate (16%) was higher in patients with multiple viral agents (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory syncytial virus remains the most common detected viral agent in acute bronchiolitis patients. While the pathogens detected were seasonally different, there was a significant relationship between leukocytosis, bacterial pneumonia, and detected viral agents.

67453,"COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic: fears, facts and preventive measures.",2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) are a frequently used class of antihypertensive drug. The ARB losartan is known to decrease the serum uric acid (SUA) level. However, there are very few clinical data comparing the effects of other ARBs on SUA level under the conditions of clinical practice. This study evaluated and compared the long-term effects of monotherapy with five ARBs on SUA level in Japanese hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). METHODS We identified hypertensive patients with type 2 DM who had been treated with monotherapy with losartan (n = 214), valsartan (n = 266), telmisartan (n = 185), candesartan (n = 458), or olmesartan (n = 192), in whom laboratory data of SUA between November 1, 2004 and July 31, 2011 were available, from the Nihon University School of Medicine's Clinical Data Warehouse (NUSM's CDW). We used a propensity-score weighting method and a multivariate regression model to adjust for differences in the background among ARB users, and compared the SUA level. The mean exposure of losartan was 264.7 days, valsartan 245.3 days, telmisartan 235.9 days, candesartan 248.9 days, and olmesartan 234.5 days. RESULTS In losartan users, mean SUA level was significantly decreased from baseline, while it was conversely increased in users of other ARBs; valsartan, telmisartan, candesartan, and olmesartan. The mean reduction of SUA level from baseline was significantly greater in losartan users compared with that in other ARB users. Comparison of ARBs other than losartan showed no significant difference in mean change in SUA level from baseline. CONCLUSIONS Our study showed that losartan had the most beneficial effect on SUA level among five ARBs, and that there was no significant difference in the unfavorable effects on SUA level among four ARBs other than losartan, at least during one year. These findings provide evidence of an effect of ARBs on SUA level, and support the benefit of the use of losartan in hypertensive patients with type 2 DM.","Nishida, Yayoi; Takahashi, Yasuo; Susa, Norio; Kanou, Nobukazu; Nakayama, Tomohiro; Asai, Satoshi",Cardiovascular diabetology,https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2840-12-159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24180232/,451

We aimed to describe the most important challenges facing gastroenterologists from around the world and compare these between those working in developed and developing countries. Methods An online questionnaire was developed, and a link distributed to gastroenterologists. Data were analyzed descriptively using Friedman and Wilcoxon matched-pair signed rank tests to compare rankings for responses. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare rankings between responses from gastroenterologists from developed and developing countries. Lower scores reflected greater challenges. Results Of 872 who started, 397 gastroenterologists (45.5%) completed the survey. Respondents represented 65 countries (226 [56.9%] from developed countries). Overall, the challenge ranked most important (smallest number) was increasing IBD prevalence (13.6%). There were significant differences in mean ranking scores for many simple aspects of care for those from developing countries compared to providers from developed countries, such as access to simple IBD treatments (5.52 vs. 6.02, p = 0.01), access to anti-TNF drugs including dose escalation (3.33 vs. 3.93, p < 0.01), access to good stoma care (2.57 vs. 3.03, p < 0.001), access to therapeutic drug monitoring (1.47 vs. 1.84, p < 0.001), and access to care for people from low socioeconomic status (2.77 vs. 3.37, p < 0.001). Conclusions Increasing IBD prevalence is seen by gastroenterologists as the greatest challenge facing them. There are significant differences between the IBD challenges facing gastroenterologists from developed and developing countries that reflect inequities in access to health care.","Gearry, Richard B; McCombie, Andrew M; Vatn, Morten; Rubin, David T; Steinwurz, Flavio; Loftus, Edward V; Kruis, Wolfgang; Tysk, Curt; Colombel, Jean-Frederic; Ng, Siew C; Van Assche, Gert; Bernstein, Charles N",Inflammatory intestinal diseases,https://doi.org/10.1159/000512310; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34124179/,451

BACKGROUND To date, no prospective, multicenter, independently-adjudicated study has evaluated the effectiveness and durability of DA in the treatment of PAD. Previous DA studies have not been prospectively powered to evaluate any differences in outcomes in patients with and without diabetes. METHODS DEFINITIVE LE (Determination of EFfectiveness of the SilverHawk(®) PerIpheral Plaque ExcisioN System (SIlverHawk Device) for the Treatment of Infrainguinal VEssels / Lower Extremities) prospectively enrolled subjects at 47 multinational centers with an infrainguinal lesion length up to 20 cm. Primary endpoints were defined as primary patency at 12 months for claudicants and freedom from major unplanned amputation for critical limb ischemia (CLI) subjects. A pre-specified statistical hypothesis evaluated noninferiority of primary patency in diabetic versus nondiabetic claudicants. Independent angiographic and sonographic core laboratories assessed outcomes, and events were adjudicated by a clinical events committee. RESULTS A total of 800 subjects were enrolled. The 12-month primary patency was 78% (95% confidence interval: 74.0% to 80.6%) in claudicants, with a 77% rate in the diabetic subgroup versus 78% in the nondiabetic subgroup (noninferior, p < 0.001). The rate of freedom from major unplanned amputation of the target limb at 12 months in CLI subjects was 95% (95% confidence interval: 90.7% to 97.4%). Periprocedural adverse events included embolization (3.8%), perforation (5.3%), and abrupt closure (2.0%). The bail-out stent rate was 3.2%. CONCLUSIONS The DEFINITIVE LE study demonstrated that DA is a safe and effective treatment modality at 12 months for a diverse patient population with either claudication or CLI. Furthermore, DA was shown to be noninferior for treating PAD in patients with diabetes compared with those without diabetes.

PATIENTS AND METHODS From 2009 to 2014, 126 left laparoscopic donor nephrectomies (LDNs) were performed, including 59 Standard (Std)-LDN, 30 LEPODN, and 37 LESSDN. In the LEPODN procedure, a 5-mm trocar was added as a right-hand working trocar to the LESSDN procedure. A GelPOINT(®) platform was applied on a pararectal single incision in both LEPODN and LESSDN procedures. After performing the LEPODN procedure several times, each surgeon performed the LESSDN procedure. RESULTS Std-LDN, LEPODN, and LESSDN procedures were performed by 10, 10, and 7 surgeons, respectively. The mean operative time, estimated blood loss, warm ischemia time, time to ambulation, and length of postoperative hospital stay were the shortest for the LESSDN procedure (P<0.012, P=0.007, P<0.001, P=0.027, and P=0.001, respectively). No significant difference in the complication rate, delayed graft function rate, and mean 7-day post-transplant serum creatinine levels was observed among the three procedures. Individual results of the operative time and estimated blood loss for the LESSDN procedure were not significantly inferior to those of Std-LDN and LEPODN procedures for each surgeon. CONCLUSIONS The LESSDN procedure can be introduced safely and effectively without compromising the operative time, complication rate, and graft function after experience with the LEPODN procedure among multiple surgeons. The LEPODN procedure may be an effective bridge from standard multiport LDN to LESSDN.","Inoue, Takamitsu; Tsuchiya, Norihiko; Narita, Shintaro; Tsuruta, Hiroshi; Akihama, Susumu; Saito, Mitsuru; Satoh, Shigeru; Habuchi, Tomonori",Journal of endourology,https://doi.org/10.1089/end.2014.0509; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25286117/,451

We analyzed workers' compensation injury claims and California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) citations in Southern California's large warehousing sector. Claims increased from 2014 to 2018, with a majority of injuries caused by repetitive motion, lifting and other ergonomic risk factors. Cal/OSHA cited employers for violating standards to protect workers from unsafe vehicle operations, dangerous machinery and equipment, and falls; and for failing to implement injury prevention programs. These citations address the causes of some worker injuries; however, no Cal/OSHA citations were issued for violating the state's Repetitive Motion Injuries prevention standard.

However, the northern region of the Antarctic Peninsula, is close to South America and experiences the greatest anthropogenic pressure in Antarctica. Here, we investigated, in two Antarctic Peninsula islands, intra and interspecific factors that influence the concentrations of 17 trace elements (TEs) in blood and feathers of three penguin species breeding sympatrically in relation to their trophic ecology assessed via a stable isotopic approach (C, N and S). Geographical location, foraging zone (δ13C and δ34S) and diet influences the interspecific difference, and sex and maturity stage diet influence the intraspecific difference of Pygoscelis penguins. Penguins from Livingston showed higher values (mean, ng. g-1, dry weight - dw) of Zn (103), Mn (0.3), and Fe (95) than those from King George Island (Zn: 80, Mn: 1.9, and Fe: 11). Gender-related differences were observed, as males showed significantly higher values (mean, ng. g-1, dw) of Rb (3.4) and δ15N in blood of gentoo, and Ca (1344) in Adélie feathers. Chicks of gentoo and Adélie presented higher Zn, Mg, Ca, and Sr and lower 13C values in blood than adults. The highest concentrations (mean, ng. g-1, dw) of Cd (0.2) and Cu (26), and the lowest δ15N values were found in chinstrap. Geographical, intraspecific (i.e., ontogenetic and gender-related) and interspecific differences in feeding seemed to have influenced TE and stable isotope values in these animals. The TE bioaccumulation by penguins may have also been influenced by natural enrichment in environmental levels of these elements, which seems to be the case for Fe, Zn, and Mn. However, the high level of some of the TEs (Mn, Cd, and Cr) may reflect the increase of local and global human activities.","Padilha, J A; Carvalho, G O; Espejo, W; Souza, J S; Pizzochero, A C; Cunha, L S T; Costa, E S; Pessôa, A R L; Almeida, A P; Torres, J P M; Lepoint, G; Michel, L N; Das, K; Dorneles, P R",Environmental pollution,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117209; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932832/,451

Distinguished from two resistance states in conventional giant magnetoresistance, the magnetoresistance in MnPS3/Fe3GeTe2 heterostructure exhibits three states, of high, intermediate and low resistance.

This study investigated the incidence of hypothermia and changes in the body temperature in patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery under ISBPB with propofol sedation. Methods This retrospective study enrolled 220 patients who underwent arthroscopic shoulder surgery. Patients were divided into general anesthesia (n = 34) and ISBPB with propofol sedation (n = 186) groups, and medical records were retrospectively compared. In addition, patients from the ISBPB group were further divided according to age (elderly, [≥ 65 years]; n = 98 vs. young, [< 65 years]; n = 88), and their data were compared. Results Twenty-seven patients (12.3%) experienced perioperative hypothermia (range; 35.3-35.9℃). The incidence of perioperative hypothermia was 29.4% and 9.1% in the general anesthesia and ISBPB groups, respectively, and there was a significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.002). The incidence of perioperative hypothermia according to age in the ISBPB group was 9.2% and 9.1% in the elderly and young groups, respectively, and there was no significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.983). Conclusions The incidence of perioperative hypothermia during arthroscopic shoulder surgery under ISBPB with propofol sedation is lower than that under general anesthesia. Furthermore, when using ISBPB with propofol sedation, the incidence of perioperative hypothermia in elderly patients is similar to that in younger patients.","Lee, Ji Hye; Heo, Hyun Joo; Kim, Yu Yil; Baek, Seung Min; Kim, Ki Man; Jung, Da Wa",Korean journal of anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.4097/kja.20152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32498491/,451

We compared several clinical measures between patients admitted for bacteremia during the two months of the COVID-19 pandemic and those admitted during the same period in 2019. We hypothesized that the pandemic has led to delayed treatment of bacteremia. Methods This retrospective observational study compared several measures undertaken for patients who visited the emergency unit in two hospitals between March 1 and May 31, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic and whose blood cultures tested positive for bacteremia with those for corresponding patients treated during the same period in 2019. The primary measure was time from consultation to blood culture/antimicrobials. Results We included 29 eligible patients from 2020 and 26 from 2019. In 2020, the time from consultation to antimicrobial administration was significantly longer than in 2019 (mean [range], 222 [145-309] min vs. 139 [102-179] min, p=0.002). The frequency of chest computed tomography (CT) was significantly higher in 2020 (96.6 vs. 73.1%, p=0.021). Significant differences were not observed in the time to blood culture or chest CT preceding the blood culture between the two periods. Conclusions Our findings suggested that due to the COVID-19 epidemic/pandemic, focusing on the exclusion of its infection using CT scans leads to an overall delay in the diagnosis and treatment of bacteremia.

The aim of this study was to analyse changes in conjunctival impression cytology with transfer and both lachrymal stability and flow tests in patients with dry eye disease after treatment with autologous serum eye drops. MATERIALS AND METHODS Conjunctival impression cytology and lachrymal flow and stability tests, namely Schirmer's and tear break-up time, were prospectively studied in patients with dry eye disease before and 1 month after treatment with autologous serum eye drops. RESULTS Twenty-four patients (23 women, mean age 53.8±12.6 years) were included in the study. Ten patients (41.7%) had moderate and six (25.0%) had severe dry eye disease. Five patients had rheumatoid arthritis. After treatment, the number and density of conjunctival goblet cells, their size, the size of their nuclei and the nucleus/cytoplasm ratio increased significantly (202.3±107.5 vs 210.1±100.9 cells/mm2, p<0.01). Seven of ten patients with grade 3 or 4 metaplasia had an improvement in the degree of metaplasia. Both Schirmer's test and tear break-up time improved significantly in this subgroup of patients. In the multivariate study, the increase in conjunctival goblet cells was associated with the number of goblet cells and the size of the cytoplasm at baseline. No adverse reactions were noted. DISCUSSION Treatment with autologous serum eye drops for 1 month was well tolerated and improved tear production, lachrymal flow and stability tests and conjunctival impression cytology with transfer, increasing the density of the goblet cells.","Valencia Castillo, Sandra L; Martín, Esther Sáez; García Frade, Luis J; García-Miguel, F Javier",Blood transfusion = Trasfusione del sangue,https://doi.org/10.2450/2020.0009-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530402/,451

The results revealed regional functional contributions to essential behavioral and cognitive functions as reflected in the NIHSS, particularly by subcortical structures. There were also side specific differences of functional contributions between the right and left hemispheric brain regions which may reflect the dominance of the left hemispheric syndrome aphasia in the NIHSS. Comparison of MSA to established lesion inference methods demonstrated the feasibility of the approach for analyzing clinical data and indicated its capability for objectively inferring functional contributions from multiple injured, potentially interacting sites, at the cost of having to predict the outcome of unknown lesion configurations.

Therefore, fast and accurate diagnosis of infection is key to timely treatment and elimination of the spread of the virus. Currently, the standard method for detecting coronavirus is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, this method requires expensive equipment and trained personnel, which limits the conduct of mass testing and lengthens the time to obtain a research result. Serological tests for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and the determination of protective immunity in various populations are used to retrospectively identify patients with asymptomatic and mild forms of infection, monitor the course of infection in hospitalized patients, and also track contacts and epidemiological surveillance. The use of standard methods for diagnosing COVID-19 in conditions of mass morbidity, especially in conditions of insufficient resources and lack of appropriate infrastructure, is associated with a number of limitations. Therefore, the search and development of new, fast, inexpensive, simple, device-free and no less sensitive and specific tests is an urgent task.

METHODS Twenty-six patients with XLH (age 3.1-25.7 years) were enrolled in Pediatric Endocrine Unit; nine of them were receiving human monoclonal anti-fibroblast growth factor 23 antibody (burosumab) and 17 (pediatric patients, age 9.5-17.9 years, n=7; young-adult patients, age 20.1-25.7 years, n=10) received conventional treatment with inorganic oral phosphate salts and active vitamin D metabolites. A Covid-19 free pathway was addressed for XLH patients receiving burosumab treatment in hospital. XLH patients receiving conventional treatment were followed by phone calls, e-mails, or telemedicine. RESULTS All XLH patients receiving burosumab continued the scheduled follow-up and treatment; none of them was infected by Covid-19. Seven XLH patients out of 17 (41%) receiving conventional treatment showed some complication related to the disease itself or its treatment: periapical abscess with gingival fistula was diagnosed in five patients (three children and two young-adults) and treated with antibiotics with complete resolution; one child showed abdominal pain due to the administration of high doses of inorganic oral phosphate salts solved by reducing the dosage, and one child had severe legs pain during deambulation after orthopedic surgery solved with common analgesics.

83347,A Tip of the Iceberg on the Mechanism of SARS-CoV-2-Induced Liver Injury.,2020-12-09,"BACKGROUND Different types of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) have become increasingly popular. Although SILS is technically even more challenging than conventional laparoscopy, published data of first clinical series seem to demonstrate the feasibility of these approaches. Various attempts have been made to overcome restrictions due to loss of triangulation in SILS by specially designed SILS-specific instruments. This study involving novices in a dry lab compared task performances between conventional laparoscopic surgery (CLS) and single-port laparoscopic surgery (SPLS) using newly designed pre-bent instruments. METHODS In this study, 90 medical students without previous experience in laparoscopic techniques were randomly assigned to undergo one of three procedures: CLS, SPLS using two pre-bent instruments (SPLS-pp), or SPLS using one pre-bent and one straight laparoscopic instrument (SPLS-ps). In the dry lab, the participants performed four typical laparoscopic tasks of increasing difficulty. Evaluation included performance times or number of completed tasks within a given time frame. All performances were videotaped and evaluated for unsuccessful attempts and unwanted interactions of instruments. Using subjective questionnaires, the participants rated difficulties with two-dimensional vision and coordination of instruments. RESULTS Task performances were significantly better in the CLS group than in either SPLS group. The SPLS-ps group showed a tendency toward better performances than the SPLS-pp group, but the difference was not significant. Video sequences and participants` questionnaires showed instrument interaction as the major problem in the single-incision surgery groups. CONCLUSIONS Although SILS is feasible, as shown in clinical series published by laparoscopically experienced experts, SILS techniques are demanding due to restrictions that come with the loss of triangulation. These can be compensated only partially by currently available SILS-designed instruments. The future of SILS depends on further improvements in the available equipment or the development of new approaches such as needlescopically assisted or robotically assisted procedures.","Miernik, Arkadiusz; Schoenthaler, Martin; Lilienthal, Kerstin; Frankenschmidt, Alexander; Karcz, Wojciech Konrad; Kuesters, Simon",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-2129-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22219012/,451

While avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) infection and avian influenza A virus (IAV) infection both depend on α2,3-linked sialic acids, the host tropism of IBV is restricted compared to that of IAV. Here we investigated whether the interaction between the viral attachment proteins and the host could explain these differences by using recombinant spike domains (S1) of IBV strains with different pathogenicities, as well as the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of IAV H5N1. Protein histochemistry showed that S1 of IBV strain M41 and HA of IAV subtype H5N1 displayed sialic acid-dependent binding to chicken respiratory tract tissue. However, while HA bound with high avidity to a broad range of α2,3-linked sialylated glycans, M41 S1 recognized only one particular α2,3-linked disialoside in a glycan array. When comparing the binding of recombinant IBV S1 proteins derived from IBV strains with known differences in tissue tropism and pathogenicity, we observed that while M41 S1 displayed binding to cilia and goblet cells of the chicken respiratory tract, S1 derived from the vaccine strain H120 or the nonvirulent Beaudette strain had reduced or no binding to chicken tissues, respectively, in agreement with the reduced abilities of these viruses to replicate in vivo. While the S1 protein derived from the nephropathogenic IBV strain B1648 also hardly displayed binding to respiratory tract cells, distinct binding to kidney cells was observed, but only after the removal of sialic acid from S1. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the attachment patterns of the IBV S proteins correlate with the tropisms and pathogenicities of the corresponding viruses.","Wickramasinghe, I N Ambepitiya; de Vries, R P; Gröne, A; de Haan, C A M; Verheije, M H",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.05112-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21697468/,451
85102,Are SARS-CoV-2 Human Challenge Trials Ethical?,2021-06-07,"BACKGROUND Occupational burnout, which is more and more commonly encountered among medical professionals and investigated by researchers worldwide, may in particular affect health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVES The aim of the study was to assess the risk of occupational burnout among physiotherapists working actively in clinical hospitals in south-eastern Poland during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS The level of burnout among the studied physiotherapists was assessed using the Polish version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory by Maslach (MBI). The study was conducted from 20 March to 3 May, 2020 among physiotherapists working professionally during the COVID-19 pandemic in the south east of Poland, during which time health services related to therapeutic rehabilitation were suspended. The study was conducted among 1,540 physiotherapists with a license to practice who worked in clinical departments. Considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 106 physiotherapists were qualified for the study. RESULTS The current findings show that during the COVID-19 pandemic physiotherapists present high burnout rates in all three dimensions: EE (Mean 32.31; CI 29.47-35.15); DP (Mean 16.25; CI 14.48-18.03); PA (Mean 26.25; CI 24.41-28.10). As for gender-related effects, higher burnout rates were observed in the male workers, compared to the females, in all three domains: EE (Men: Mean 34.70; CI 29.90-39.50 -Women: Mean 31.03; CI 27.45-34.60); DP (Men: Mean 18.78; CI 15.98-21.59 -Women: Mean 14.90; CI 12.64-17.16) and PA (Men: Mean 24.54; CI 21.32-27.76 -Women: Mean 27.17; CI 24.90-29.44). The highest burnout rates, presented by the physiotherapists working in the profession for more than 20 years, were identified in the domain of EE (Mean: 35.30; CI 30.51-40.10) and in those with 10-15 years of experience, in the domains of DP (Mean: 18.31; CI 14.89-21.73) and PA (Mean: 23.97; CI 20.13-27.81). The highest rate of occupational burnout, reflected by the scores in all three domains (EE, DP, PA), was identified in Department I -Intensive Care and Anaesthesiology Department: EE - (Mean: 40.89, CI 35.27-46.52); DP - (Mean: 21.39, CI 17.90-24.88); and PA - (Mean: 23.07, CI 20.04-26.10), compared to the other departments. The subjects who rarely participated in courses or training programs showed the highest burnout rates (EE- Mean: 33.55, CI 29.33-37.77; DP- Mean: 16.71, CI 13.99-19.43; PA- Mean: 25.45, CI 22.47-28.43). CONCLUSIONS Occupational burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic is noticeable among physiotherapists working in clinical departments. The current findings show high burnout rates in all three domains: emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP) and personal accomplishment (PA). A comparative analysis of these findings with reference to related studies published before the pandemic shows that the burnout rates among physiotherapists may have significantly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, given the scarcity of scientific evidence related to this specific problem in Poland and worldwide, it is necessary to continue research in occupational burnout affecting physiotherapists, particularly during the second wave of the pandemic, in order to gain a better understanding of the possible effects of social isolation and greater personal work-related health risks on the mental health of these medical professionals.","Pniak, Bogumiła; Leszczak, Justyna; Adamczyk, Marzena; Rusek, Wojciech; Matłosz, Piotr; Guzik, Agnieszka",Work,https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-203375; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33492259/,451

Understanding how advertisers constructed their public messages during a global pandemic is a necessary first step before follow-up research can be done to assess which message strategies were most effective. Content analysis was performed on the entire COVID-19 video ad library (N = 354) from Ads of the World website that were published from March to September 2020 from 49 countries. Results suggested that most of the ads used a transformational strategy with a focus on the social aspect of limiting community spread instead of an informational approach. Many of the ads also employed a narrative message strategy that used storytelling to transport and persuade viewers. Perhaps the most interesting finding is that the use of narrative message strategy was related to storytelling, ad length, music, and humor, but independent from the use of informational strategies.","Deng, Tao; Ekachai, Daradirek; Pokrywczynski, James",Health communication,https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2020.1859725; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33349050/,451

Rectal prolapse, a benign localized condition causing considerable morbidity, could be an excellent focus for new endoscopic therapies. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and safety of endoluminal fixation of the rectum to the anterior abdominal wall, after pushing it up inside the body, using an in vivo animal model. METHODS We performed an in vivo comparative surgical study in a porcine model, including laparoscopic mobilization of the rectum and posterior rectopexy (standard surgical method) or endoluminal tacking of the rectum. After proving feasibility in ex vivo and acute studies, we performed a survival study to evaluate the safety of endoluminal tacking of the mobilized rectum to the anterior abdominal wall. The main outcome measures were successful completion of the tasks, maintenance of the fixation, complications associated with the methods, and survival studies including histopathological examinations of the fixation sites. RESULTS There were two groups: laparoscopic rectopexy (8 animals) and endoluminal fixation of the rectum to the anterior abdominal wall (10 animals). There were no differences between these two groups in their postoperative recovery. The group with the endoluminal fixation was found to have adequate attachment of the rectum to the anterior abdominal wall (measured attachment pressure in the endoluminal group = 6.06 ± 0.52 ft-lb, in the control group = 4.86 ± 2.00 ft-lb) on both gross and microscopic evaluation. CONCLUSION Endoscopic fixation of the mobilized rectum is feasible and safe in this model and in the future may provide an effective alternative to current treatment options for rectal prolapse.","Milsom, Jeffrey; Trencheva, Koiana; Pavoor, Raghava; Dirocco, Joseph; Shukla, Parul J; Kawamura, Junichiro; Sonoda, Toyooki",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1778-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21643879/,451

OBJECTIVE We studied phyto-compounds from Strychnos nux-vomica (a poisonous plant) against SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase by computational methods. METHOD Molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and energetics calculations were employed to elucidate the role of the phyto-compounds. RESULTS Ergotamine with a binding free energy of -14.39 kcal/mol showed a promising capability in terms of both the binding affinity and interacting to conserved motifs, especially the SDD signature sequence. The calculated dissociation constants for ATP, ergotamine, isosungucine and sungucine were 12 µM, 0.072 nM, 0.011 nM and 0.152 nM, respectively. The exhibited kd by these phyto-compounds reflected a tens of thousands fold potency as compared to ATP. The binding free energies of sungucine and isosungucine were much lower (-13.93 and -15.55 kcal/mol, respectively) compared to that of ATP (-6.98 kcal/mol). CONCLUSION Sharing the same binding location as that of ATP and having high binding affinities, Ergotamine, Isosungucine, Sungucine and Strychnine N-oxide could be effective in controlling the SARS-CoV-2 virus replication by blocking the ATP and inhibiting the enzyme function.","Balkrishna, Acharya; Pokhrel, Subarna; Varshney, Anurag",Current molecular medicine,https://doi.org/10.2174/1566524021666210218113409; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33602083/,451

METHODS A 10-year-old girl underwent left nephroureterectomy by LESS due to end-stage reflux nephropathy on December 25, 2008. The surgery is performed transperitoneally, through a 2-cm semicircular incision in the left inner curve of the umbilicus using three 5-mm trocars. NUx with LESS was performed duplicating standard laparoscopic steps with the help of flexible and straight laparoscopic instruments. RESULTS Operation time was 140 minutes and the blood loss was minimal. There was no intraoperative or postoperative complication. The patient was discharged at the 24th postoperative hour. The postoperative cosmetic result was excellent as the incision scar was hidden inside the belly button. CONCLUSIONS NUx with LESS is a feasible technique with the advantages of less pain, shortened convalescence, improved cosmesis, and absence of wound complications in children. However, clear indications of LESS in children remain to be clarified.","Bayazit, Yildirim; Aridogan, Ibrahim Atilla; Abat, Deniz; Satar, Nihat; Doran, Saban",Urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2009.05.096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19773040/,451

Ultrasonography and computed tomography findings were compatible with liposarcoma of the spermatic cord. We performed a right radical orchiectomy with a wide resection of the mass. Histological examination confirmed the diagnosis and showed a pleomorphic subtype. The mainstay of management of spermatic cord liposarcoma is wide excision with radical orchiectomy. The most important factors for prognosis are the histologic subtype and surgical margin status. Adjuvant radiotherapy should be considered in cases at high risk for local recurrence. Long-term surveillance is mandatory. Liposarcoma of the spermatic cord is an uncommon para testicular tumor which should be part of the differential diagnosis of inguinoscrotal mass.

99235,Awareness of dental practitioners and intern dental practitioners in Northern Cyprus towards pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND It becomes increasingly evident that the SARS-CoV-2 infection is not limited to the respiratory system. In addition to being a target of the virus, the kidney also seems to have substantial influence on the outcomes of the disease. Methods: Data was obtained by a comprehensive and non-systematic search in the PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus and SciELO databases, using mainly the terms ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""COVID-19"", ""chronic kidney disease"", ""renal transplantation"", acute kidney injury"" and ""renal dysfunction"". Discussion: The membrane-bound angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and this interaction may lead to an imbalance of the Renin Angiotensin System (RAS), associated with worse clinical presentations of COVID-19, including acute pulmonary injury, hyperinflammatory state and hematological alterations. In the framework of renal diseases, development of acute kidney injury is associated mostly with immune alterations and direct cytopathic lesions by the virus, leading to higher mortality. As for chronic kidney disease, the patients at a non-terminal stage have worse prog-nosis, while the hemodialysis patients appear to have mild courses of COVID-19, probably due to lower chances of being affected by the cytokine storm. Furthermore, the current scenario is unfavorable to kidney donation and transplantation. The relationship between COVID-19 and immunosuppression in kidney transplantation recipients has been greatly discussed to determine whether it increases mortality and how it interacts with immunosuppressive medications. Conclusion: The kidney and the RAS exert fundamental roles in the SARS-CoV-2 infection and more research is required to have a complete understanding on the repercussions caused by COVID-19 in renal diseases.","Cota, Letícia Bitencourt; Pedrosa, Ana Luisa; de Brito, Stephanie Bruna Camilo Soares; Fróes, Ana Cláudia Fontoura; de Carvalho, Sarah Tayná; Fonseca, Giulio Gori; Ferreira, Guilherme Costa; Fradico, Pollyanna Faria; Simões E Silva, Ana Cristina",Current drug targets,https://doi.org/10.2174/1389450121999201013151300; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33050860/,451

Even in the COVID-19 epidemic some sex/gender differences emerged. OBJECTIVES to analyze COVID-19 epidemic data by gender and age in Italy, Germany, Spain, and Sweden, characterized by having implemented different pandemic containment policies, with the aim of observing any characteristics that can be interpreted with the lens of sex/gender differences. MATERIALS AND METHODS we used confirmed cases and deaths associated with COVID-19 for Italy, Spain, Germany, and Sweden from respective national surveillance databases. Mortality data for Italy were also analysed. The period of investigation was March-May 2020. As indicators, we used the case fatality ratio adjusted for time delay and SMR for mortality. RESULTS women are more vulnerable to COVID- 19 infection in the 30-60-year age group. Case fatality ratio is higher in men than women, with a ratio men/women equal to 1.7 in Italy, Spain, and Sweden and 1,4 in Germany. The ratio increases in the lower age groups. The analysis of the mortality data observed/expected in Italy in the same period with respect to 2015-2019 shows a comparable excess with SMR equal to 132 for men and 127 for women. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 affects both genders with some differences in the incidence, higher in women, and lethality, higher in men. These differences highlight the need to better understand the sex/gender and age interaction both for epidemiological surveillance and for a better gender-appropriateness of the ongoing prophylactic and therapeutic treatments. This would be possible if all health indicators (symptoms, past illnesses, primary and hospital-level health care, hospitalization, etc.) were provided by age and gender. Analysis of the causes of death could help to better understand the increase in mortality for both genders, in particular for women, for whom a lower lethality for COVID-19 appears from data.","Mangia, Cristina; Russo, Antonello; Civitelli, Serenella; Gianicolo, Emilio Antonio Luca",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,https://doi.org/10.19191/ep20.5-6.s2.145; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33412835/,451

There are technical obstacles still hindering large-scale commercialization of cultivated meat, of which many are related to the media that are used to culture the muscle, fat, and connective tissue cells. While animal cell culture media has been used and refined for roughly a century, it has not been specifically designed with the requirements of cultivated meat in mind. Perhaps the most common industrial use of animal cell culture is currently the production of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, which sell for orders of magnitude more than meat. Successful production of cultivated meat requires media that is food grade with minimal cost, can regulate large-scale cell proliferation and differentiation, has acceptable sensory qualities, and is animal ingredient-free. Much insight into strategies for achieving media formulations with these qualities can be obtained from knowledge of conventional culture media applications and from the metabolic pathways involved in myogenesis and protein synthesis. In addition, application of principles used to optimize media for large-scale microbial fermentation processes producing lower value commodity chemicals and food ingredients can also be instructive.

Therefore, hospital crisis management should implement efforts to improve hospital workers' preparedness in responding to public health emergencies caused by infectious diseases. Traditionally, preparedness and skill of hospital workers have been emphasized, but awareness of the importance of the emotional mindset of hospital workers in dealing with disease outbreaks has only recently increased; therefore, empirical approaches to examining emotional responses of hospital workers has been limited. This study analyzed qualitative data of the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in South Korea. In particular, negative emotions and stress experienced by hospital workers who treated patients were characterized, as were the events that triggered such experiences. These events were categorized into four themes (eg, Mistake, Missing, Delay Due to Communication Failure).

This study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine combined with midazolam for undergoing conscious sedation during bronchoscopy. METHODS The trial was registered prior to patient enrollment at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry. Patients were randomized into DEX group (dexmedetomidine combined with midazolam) and FEN group (fentanyl combined with midazolam). Bronchoscopy was performed under awake sedation titrated to a BIS level of 60-80. The primary endpoint was the incidence of hypoxia, the secondary endpoint was the incidence of bradycardia and hypotension, effect of sedation including satisfaction degree (VAS) of the operators and patients and patients' willingness to undergo bronchoscopy again. RESULTS A total of 222 cases in DEX group and 211 cases in FEN group completed the study. The incidence of hypoxia and tachycardia in DEX group was lower than that in FEN group (8.1% vs 14.7%, 10.4% vs 19.0%, P<0.05), and the incidence of hypotension and bradycardia in DEX group was higher than that in FEN group (6.8% vs 0, 15.3% vs 8.1%, P<0.05). Midazolam dosage was significantly lower in the DEX group than in the FEN group, and the duration of surgery was significantly longer in the DEX group. The differences in intraoperative discomfort of VAS score, satisfaction VAS score, and willingness rate to undergo bronchoscopy again were not statistically significant between the two groups. In addition, the proportion of ""procedural interference by patient movement"" in DEX group was higher than that in FEN group. CONCLUSIONS The conscious sedation regimen of dexmedetomidine combined with midazolam monitored by BIS is considered to be safe and effective during bronchoscopy.

The rapid spread of the novel SARS CoV-2 worldwide is raising a significant global public health issue with nearly 61.86 million people infected and 1.4 million deaths. To date, no specific drugs are available for the treatment of COVID-19. The inhibition of proteases essential for the proteolytic treatment of viral polyproteins is a conventional therapeutic strategy for conquering viral infections. In the study, molecular docking approach was used to screen potential drug compounds among the phytochemicals of Vitex negundo L. against COVID-19 infection. Molecular docking analysis showed that oleanolic acid forms a stable complex and other phyto-compounds ursolic acid, 3β-acetoxyolean-12-en-27-oic acid and isovitexin of V. negundo natural compounds form a less-stable complex. When compared with the control the synergistic interaction of these compounds shows inhibitory activity against papain-like protease (PLpro) of SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19). The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation (50 ns) were performed on the complexes of PLpro and the phyto-compounds viz. oleanolic acid, ursolic acid, 3β-acetoxyolean-12-en-27-oic acid and isovitexin followed by the binding free energy calculations using MM-GBSA and these molecules have stable interactions with PLpro protein binding site. The MD simulation study provides more insight into the functional properties of the protein-ligand complex and suggests that these molecules can be considered as a potential drug molecule against COVID-19.

Due to the lack of specific anti-CoV therapies, the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses a great challenge to clinical management and highlights an urgent need for effective interventions. Drug repurposing is a rapid and feasible strategy to identify effective drugs for combating this deadly infection. In this review, we summarize the therapeutic CoV targets, focus on the existing small molecule drugs that have the potential to be repurposed for existing and emerging CoV infections of the future, and discuss the clinical progress of developing small molecule drugs for COVID-19.","Xu, Jimin; Xue, Yu; Zhou, Richard; Shi, Pei-Yong; Li, Hongmin; Zhou, Jia",Medicinal research reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/med.21763; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33277927/,451

Current public health capacity and ability to detect and respond to EIDs is typically weakest in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Many known drivers of EID emergence also converge in LMICs. Strengthening capacity for surveillance of diseases of relevance to local populations can provide a mechanism for building the cross-cutting and flexible capacities needed to tackle both the burden of existing diseases and EID threats. A focus on locally relevant diseases in LMICs and the economic, social, and cultural contexts of surveillance can help address existing inequalities in health systems, improve the capacity to detect and contain EIDs, and contribute to broader global goals for development.","Halliday, Jo E B; Hampson, Katie; Hanley, Nick; Lembo, Tiziana; Sharp, Joanne P; Haydon, Daniel T; Cleaveland, Sarah",Science,https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aam8332; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28706036/,451

The outbreak further exploded in Europe and America in mid-March 2020 to become a global health emergency. We reviewed recent published articles and on-line open messages on SARS-CoV-2-positive infants and children younger than 20 years of age. Symptoms are usually less severe in children than in adults. Twelve critically or mortally ill children were found in the published or news reports before April 6, 2020. Vertical transmission from the mother to her fetus or neonate has not been proven definitively. However, six early-onset (<7 days) and 3 late-onset neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infections were found in the literature. We also summarized the presentations and contact information of 24 SARS-CoV-2-positive children announced by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. Early identification and isolation, adequate management, prevention, and vaccine development are the keys to controlling the disease spread.

The patients were randomized to a SC (n = 99) or a CC (n = 90) and were then followed for 2 years. All catheter placements were performed by two designated experienced nephrologists who used a standardized institutional placement protocol. The primary study outcomes were catheter-related complications and catheter survival at 1 and 2 years. ♦ RESULTS We observed no significant differences in clinical and demographic characteristics between the groups at baseline. The overall incidence of catheter dysfunction was higher in the CC group than in the SC group (17.8% vs 7.1%, p = 0.03), and most of the events occurred 4 weeks or more after the catheters were implanted. Catheter tip migration and omental wrapping were the most common causes of catheter dysfunction. Surgical catheter rescue was more common in patients with CCs than in patients with SCs (9 vs 3 patients respectively, p = 0.05). No significant differences were observed in other catheter-related complications, including dialysate leaks, hernias, and PD-related infections (peritonitis, exit-site, and tunnel infections). Catheter survival rates in the SC and CC groups were similar at 1 year (96.7% ± 1.9% vs 96.5% ± 2.0%, p = 0.98) and at 2 years (95.3% ± 2.3% vs 92.4% ± 3.6%, p = 0.76). ♦ CONCLUSIONS The incidence of PD catheter-related complications is probably higher with CCs than with SCs. The results of our study suggest that a SC is the better option to reduce subsequent catheter complications.","Ouyang, Chu-Jun; Huang, Feng-Xian; Yang, Qiong-Qiong; Jiang, Zong-Pei; Chen, Wei; Qiu, Yagui; Yu, Xue-Qing",Peritoneal dialysis international : journal of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis,https://doi.org/10.3747/pdi.2013.00016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24584608/,451

Previous studies found that access to testing has not been equitable across several sociodemographic indicators. This study documents the preferred testing locations and examines differences across sociodemographic factors with a specific focus on race and ethnicity. METHODS This study includes a primary analysis of cross-sectional data using a self-administered digital survey distributed to Arkansas residents using ARresearch, a volunteer research participant registry. The survey had 1288 responses, and 1221 met eligibility criteria for inclusion in the survey. Participants provided sociodemographic information and were asked to select up to 3 preferred testing locations from 12 options. Chi-square tests assessed differences in testing site preference across relevant sociodemographic groups. RESULTS Participants preferred drive-through clinics as their top location for COVID-19 testing, with 55% reporting this was their preferred method of testing. This pattern was consistent across all comparison groups (ie, age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, insurance status). Significant differences in testing location preference were observed across age, race and ethnicity, and education, with the most differences observed across race and ethnicity. CONCLUSION This study reveals that race and ethnicity are important to consider when deciding where to offer COVID-19 testing. The preferences for testing locations among the most vulnerable demographics will be used to develop targeted responses aimed at eliminating disparities in COVID-19 in Arkansas.","McElfish, Pearl A; Willis, Don E; Bryant-Moore, Keneshia; Rojo, Martha O; Andersen, Jennifer A; Kaminicki, Kyle F; James, Laura P",Journal of primary care & community health,https://doi.org/10.1177/21501327211004289; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33771056/,451

115223,SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic: Should Children Wear Masks?,2020-09-03,"INTRODUCTION Infection of cardiac implanted electrical devices (CIED) is a problem. In selected patients, use of an ""antibacterial envelope"" (AIGISRx®) is associated with low CIED infection rates. The value of this device when used as a standard of care is unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS Retrospective analysis of all patients (N = 1,476) who underwent CIED implantation at a single hospital. During the study period, some implanters used the AIGISRx as a standard of care (Yes-AIGISRx Group, N = 365), whereas others did not use it at all (No-AIGISRx Group, N = 1,111). A risk score based on preoperative factors was calculated for each patient. Rates of CIED infection within 6 months were measured, and associated costs were estimated. The Yes-AIGISRx and No-AIGISRx groups had similar preoperative infection risk. In the No-AIGISRx group, 19 infections were observed (1.7%), versus 0 in the Yes-AIGISRx group (P = 0.006). The 6-month mortality rate among patients with infection was significantly greater than among those without infection (15.7% vs. 4.5%, P = 0.021). The average hospital duration for infection care was 13 days. By extrapolating the infection rate and costs observed in the No-AIGISRx group to the Yes-AIGISRx group, we estimated that there would have been 6.2 additional infections costing approximately $340,000. This cost was similar to the actual cost of the devices in the Yes-AIGISRx group, estimated at $320,000. CONCLUSIONS Standard of care use of an antibacterial envelope as a standard of care was associated with a significantly lower rate of CIED infection, and appeared to be economically reasonable. Prospective trials to address these findings may be worthwhile.","Shariff, Nasir; Eby, Elizabeth; Adelstein, Evan; Jain, Sandeep; Shalaby, Alaa; Saba, Samir; Wang, Norman C; Schwartzman, David",Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology,https://doi.org/10.1111/jce.12684; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25845917/,451

The collision stress between the vocal folds depends on the vocal fold velocity at the time of impact. Hence this vocal fold collision speed is a relevant parameter when considering biomechanical economy of phonation, especially in voice professionals needing a louder voice than normal. Combining a precise photometric measurement of glottal area and simultaneous measurements of translaryngeal impedance (electroglottogram) for identifying the time of the maximum rate of increase of vocal fold contact allows computing the vocal fold collision speed in a wide range of loudnesses. The vocal fold collision speed is - for modal voicing - always smaller than the maximum vocal fold velocity during the closing phase, but it strongly increases with intensity. Moreover, this increase shows a biphasic pattern, with a significant enhancement from a certain value of dB on. Understanding physiological variables that influence vocal fold collision forces provides relevant insight into the pathophysiology and the prevention of voice disorders associated with phonotraumatic vocal hyperfunction.","DeJonckere, Philippe Henri; Lebacq, Jean",Journal of voice : official journal of the Voice Foundation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvoice.2020.08.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33004227/,451

Because the mumps vaccine can cause aseptic meningitis in rare cases, this vaccine is not routine in Japan. This has led to low vaccine coverage and severe disease burden in Japan. The present review summarizes mumps epidemiology and vaccination and discusses effective future strategies to mitigate the current disease burden of mumps in Japan. Although a recent study reported that mumps vaccine coverage rates are improving in Japan, current coverage rates are far below the optimal rate to suppress the ongoing epidemic, which has caused an average annual financial loss of 85 billion JPY between 2000 and 2016. Recent reports have demonstrated a much lower incidence of vaccine-induced aseptic meningitis in newly developed vaccines, especially when administered at 1 year of age. Cost-effectiveness studies suggest that routinization of the currently distributed domestic vaccine would be highly cost-effective. In addition, questionnaire surveillance data suggest that the majority of the Japanese population accepts the nominal risk of the vaccine when the proper information is provided. Finally, there are some successful programs in Japan that have attained high vaccine coverage rates with financial support from local governments.

However, sampling via nasopharyngeal swabs frequently provokes sneezing or coughing, which results in increased risk of the viral dissemination and environmental contamination. Furthermore, the sensitivity associated with the PCR tests s limited to 60%-70%, which is mainly attributable to technical deficiency in sampling. Given that the disease is transmitted via exhaled aerosol and droplets, and that the exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is the established modality for sampling exhaled aerosol, detection of the viral RNA in EBC is a promising approach for safe and efficient diagnosis of the disease. Subjects are those patients who are diagnosed with COVID-19 by positive nasopharyngeal swab PCR test and admitted to Saitama Medical Center, Japan. EBC samples will be collected using an R-tube® or R-tubeVent® device. Collected EBC samples will be introduced into a nucleic acid purifier. The purified nucleic acids will undergo amplification through RT-PCR for detection and quantification of SARS-COV-2 RNA. To date we have collected eight samples from seven subjects. Among them, two samples from two subjects tested positive for SARS-COV-2 RNA by the RT-PCR.

Beyond this, we argue that there is tremendous untapped potential in using explanations to motivate behavior change. In this article we focus on health interventions. We review four case studies that used carefully tailored explanations to address gaps and misconceptions in people's intuitive theories, providing participants with a conceptual framework for understanding how and why some recommended behavior is an effective way of achieving a health goal. These case studies targeted a variety of health-promoting behaviors: (1) children washing their hands to prevent viral epidemics; (2) parents vaccinating their children to stem the resurgence of infectious diseases; (3) adults completing the full course of an antibiotic prescription to reduce antibiotic resistance; and (4) children eating a variety of healthy foods to improve unhealthy diets. Simply telling people to engage in these behaviors has been largely ineffective-if anything, concern about these issues is mounting. But in each case, teaching participants coherent explanatory frameworks for understanding health recommendations has shown great promise, with such theory-based explanations outperforming state-of-the-art interventions from national health authorities. We contrast theory-based explanations both with simply listing facts, information, and advice and with providing a full-blown educational curriculum, and argue for providing the minimum amount of information required to understand the causal link between a target behavior and a health outcome. We argue that such theory-based explanations lend people the motivation and confidence to act on their new understanding.","Weisman, Kara; Markman, Ellen M",Psychonomic bulletin & review,https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-016-1207-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28097604/,451

Nevertheless, few data are available regarding their force-generating capacities. The objective of this study was to provide a model of the force-length-activation relationships of the hand extensors using non-invasive methods. The extensor carpi radialis (ECR) and the extensor digitorum communis (EDC) were studied as representative of wrist and finger extensors. Ten participants performed isometric extension force-varying contractions in different postures on an ergometer recording resultant moment. The joint angle, the myotendinous junction displacement and activation were synchronously tracked using motion capture, ultrasound and electromyography. Muscle force was estimated via a musculoskeletal model using the measured joint angle and moment. The force-length-activation relationship was then obtained by fitting a force-length model at different activation levels to the measured data. The obtained relationships agreed with previously reported data regarding muscle architecture, sarcomere length and activation-dependent shift of optimal length. Muscle forces estimated from kinematics and electromyography using the force-length-activation relationships were comparable, below 15% differences, to those estimated from moment via the musculoskeletal model. The obtained quantitative data provides a new insight into the different muscle mechanics of finger and wrist extensors. Graphical abstract By combining in vivo data (kinematics, dynamometry, electromyography, ultrasonography) during isometric force-varying contractions with musculoskeletal modelling, the force-length-activation relationships of both finger and wrist extensors were obtained.

This study evaluates the immediate and long-term efficacy and complication rate of a two sequential RFA technique for OO. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed medical records and attempted interview follow-up for 25 patients treated with RFA for OO. Each treatment included 2 consecutive RFAs at 90 °C for 6 min with inter-ablation cooling to 40 °C and occasional inter-ablation probe adjustment. Additionally, we statistically compared the proportion of successful ablations using the DCRFA technique with published studies that utilized alternative OO ablation procedures. RESULTS Long-term follow-up was obtained for 24 patients (96 %). Mean patient age at DCRFA was 17.2 years (range, 2.2-50.0 years). Mean time to follow-up was 60 ± 42 months (range 12-152 months). No acute DCRFA-related complications nor long-term recurrences were reported. All 24 interviewed patients reported partial relief of pre-procedural pain within 1 day of DCRFA and total relief within 1 week of DCRFA. One patient ultimately developed a major late complication (complex regional pain syndrome of the left ankle) after DCRFA of a cuboid lesion. Additionally, the DCRFA success rate was significantly higher when compared to two other published OO RFA treatment results. CONCLUSION DCRFA employing two sequential 6-min cycles is an effective treatment of OO. The 100 % primary success rate, 0 % long-term recurrence rate, and low complication rate compare favorably and may be superior to results of prior reports.","Abboud, Salim; Kosmas, Christos; Novak, Ronald; Robbin, Mark",Skeletal radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00256-015-2321-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26796151/,451

Robotic TP is not often reported but may harbor some advantages compared to the open approach. This manuscript details a single institution's outcomes and technique of robotic TP. An accompanying video demonstrates a robotic TP with auto islet cell transplantation (IAT) in which (1) the arterial blood supply and venous drainage are kept intact until the last step of the TP to minimize warm ischemia time and (2) extirpation of the entire pancreas is performed without dividing the pancreatic neck to maximize islet recovery. METHODS This study is a retrospective review of a prospective database of perioperative outcomes of all consecutive robotic TPs at a single institution. This included a single robotic TP with IAT performed on a twenty-year-old patient with chronic pancreatitis. RESULTS Between 2010 and January 2014, ten robotic TPs were performed (7 males, mean age 58 years), one of which included an IAT. Median body mass index was 28. Indications were intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (6), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (1), and chronic pancreatitis (3). The median operative time was 560 min with a median estimated blood loss of 650 ml. One case was converted to laparotomy. Ninety days mortality and Clavien III-IV complication rate were 0 and 20 %, respectively. The average length of stay was 10 ± 3 days, with only 1 readmission within 90 days. The single TP and IAT were completed successfully without conversion, and were achieved without division of the pancreatic neck thereby maintaining vascular inflow to an entire specimen up until extraction. CONCLUSION This represents the largest series of robotic TP, demonstrating its safety and feasibility. Additionally, TP and IAT using the technique described above can be recapitulated using the robotic approach.","Zureikat, Amer H; Nguyen, Trang; Boone, Brian A; Wijkstrom, Martin; Hogg, Melissa E; Humar, Abhinav; Zeh, Herbert",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3656-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25005012/,451

We investigated testing for viral infections in children requiring PICU admission and describe the epidemiology and outcomes. DESIGN Multicenter retrospective study. Results of viral testing for nine respiratory viruses using polymerase chain reaction were collected. PARTICIPANTS Children less than 16 years old nonelectively admitted to PICU over a 6-year period. SETTING Two tertiary PICUs in Queensland, Australia. INTERVENTIONS None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcome was PICU length of stay. Secondary outcomes included need for and duration of intubation and mortality in PICU. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed, adjusting for age, indigenous status, comorbidities, and severity of illness. RESULTS Of 6,426 nonelective admissions, 2,956 (46%) were polymerase chain reaction tested for a virus of which 1,353 (46%) were virus positive. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most common pathogen identified (n = 518, 33%), followed by rhinovirus/enterovirus and adenovirus. Across all patients who underwent polymerase chain reaction testing, identification of a respiratory virus was not significantly associated with longer overall length of stay (multivariate odds ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.99-1.17; p = 0.068) or longer intubation (p = 0.181), whereas the adjusted odds for intubation and mortality were significantly lower (p < 0.01). Subgroup analyses restricted to patients with acute respiratory infections (n = 1,241), bronchiolitis (n = 761), pneumonia (n = 311), confirmed bacterial infection (n = 345), and malignancy (n = 95) showed that patients positive for a virus on testing had significantly longer PICU length of stay (multivariate p < 0.05). In children with pneumonia, identification of a respiratory virus was associated with significantly increased duration of ventilation (p = 0.003). No association between positive test results for multiple viruses and outcomes was observed. CONCLUSION Viral infections are common in critically ill children. Viral infections were associated with lower intubation and mortality rates compared with all children testing negative for viral infections. In several subgroups studied, identification of viral pathogens was associated with longer PICU length of stay while mortality was comparable. Prospective studies are required to determine the benefit of routine testing for respiratory viruses at the time of PICU admission.","Moynihan, Katie M; McGarvey, Tambra; Barlow, Andrew; Heney, Claire; Gibbons, Kristen; Clark, Julia E; Schlebusch, Sanmarié; Schlapbach, Luregn J",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,https://doi.org/10.1097/pcc.0000000000002302; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32343113/,451
129560,Prolonged SARS-CoV-2 Infection in a CAR T-Cell Therapy Recipient.,2021-03-09,"BACKGROUND Previous work has demonstrated paradoxical increases in cerebral oxygen saturation (ScO2) as blood pressure decreases and paradoxical decreases in ScO2 as blood pressure increases. It has been suggested that these paradoxical responses indicate a functional cerebral autoregulation mechanism. Accordingly, the authors hypothesized that if this suggestion is correct, paradoxical responses will occur exclusively in patients with intact cerebral autoregulation. METHODS Thirty-four patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery were included. Cerebral autoregulation was assessed with the near-infrared spectroscopy-derived cerebral oximetry index (COx), computed by calculating the Spearman correlation coefficient between mean arterial pressure and ScO2. COx less than 0.30 was previously defined as functional autoregulation. During cardiopulmonary bypass, 20% change in blood pressure was accomplished with the use of nitroprusside for decreasing pressure and phenylephrine for increasing pressure. Effects on COx were assessed. Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS Sixty-five percent of patients had a baseline COx less than 0.30, indicating functional baseline autoregulation. In 50% of these patients (n = 10), COx became highly negative after vasoactive drug administration (from -0.04 [-0.25 to 0.16] to -0.63 [-0.83 to -0.26] after administration of phenylephrine, and from -0.05 [-0.19 to 0.17] to -0.55 [-0.94 to -0.35] after administration of nitroprusside). A negative COx implies a decrease in ScO2 with increase in pressure and, conversely, an increase in ScO2 with decrease in pressure. CONCLUSIONS In this study, paradoxical changes in ScO2 after pharmacological-induced pressure changes occurred exclusively in patients with intact cerebral autoregulation, corroborating the hypothesis that these paradoxical responses might be attributable to a functional cerebral autoregulation.","Moerman, Annelies T; Vanbiervliet, Valerie M; Van Wesemael, Astrid; Bouchez, Stefaan M; Wouters, Patrick F; De Hert, Stefan G",Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0000000000000715; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26035251/,451

While complete recovery of language in chronic aphasia is rare, patients' naming ability can be significantly improved by speech therapy. A growing number of neuroimaging studies have tried to pinpoint the neural changes associated with successful outcome of naming treatment. However, the mechanisms supporting naming practice in the healthy brain have received little attention. Yet, understanding these mechanisms is crucial for teasing them apart from functional reorganization following brain damage. To address this issue, we trained a group of healthy monolingual Italian speakers on naming pictured objects and actions for ten consecutive days and scanned them before and after training. Although activity during object versus action naming dissociated in several regions (lateral occipitotemporal, parietal and left inferior frontal cortices), training effects for the two word classes were similar and included activation decreases in classical language regions of the left hemisphere (posterior inferior frontal gyrus, anterior insula), potentially due to decreased lexical selection demands. Additionally, MVPA revealed training-related activation changes in the left parietal and temporal cortices associated with the retrieval of knowledge from episodic memory (precuneus, angular gyrus) and facilitated access to phonological word forms (posterior superior temporal sulcus).","Delikishkina, Ekaterina; Lingnau, Angelika; Miceli, Gabriele",Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2020.05.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818916/,451

Our method consists in automatically extracting intercostal patches from chest radiographs belonging to the test database using a semiautomatic segmentation method of the ribs. Statistical and spectral features are computed from each patch then a method of feature transformation is applied using the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). A training database of 321 patches was classified by an expert in two classes, a class of normal patches and a class of abnormal patches. Patches belonging to the test database are then classified using the SVM classifier. Finally, the rate of abnormal patches is calculated for each quadrant to decide if the chest radiograph presents an ARDS. The method has been evaluated on 90 radiographs where 53 images present ARDS.

Accurate measurement of physical activity in free-living environment is important in evaluating physical activity interventions. RESEARCH QUESTION What is the criterion validity of 1)an ActiGraph to identify physical activity at different intensity levels and 2)an ActiGraph and a smartphone to measure step rate? METHODS Community-dwelling older people aged≥60 were recruited. The index tests were using ActiGraph worn in different positions (i.e.,both wrists and hip) to measure physical activity intensity and step rate and using smartphone (i.e., Samsung J2 pro and Google Fit) worn in different positions (i.e.,trousers pocket and waist pouch) to measure the step rate. The reference standards were using indirect calorimetry (i.e.,CosMedK4b 2) to measure physical activity intensity and using direct observation for step rate. Subjects were exposed in different physical activity intensity levels (i.e.,sedentary:MET < 1.5,light: MET = 1.5-2.99, moderate:MET = 3.0-6.0, vigorous:MET>6) and step rates through walking on a treadmill at different speeds (i.e.,2-8 km) for approximately 30 min. Spearman's rho, ROC analysis, and percentage error were employed to report the criterion validity. RESULTS 31 participants completed the tests. ActiGraphs worn in different body positions could significantly differentiate physical activity intensity at the levels of ""light- or-above"" (VM cut-off = 279.5-1959.1,AUC = 0.932-0.954), ""moderate-or-above"" (VM cut- off = 1051.0-4212.9,AUC = 0.918-0.932), and ""vigorous"" (VM cut-off = 3335.4-5093.0, AUC = 0.890-0.907) well with different cut-off points identified. The step rate measured by direct observation correlated significantly with ActiGraph and smartphone (rho = 0.415-0.791). Both ActiGraph and smartphone at different positions generally underestimated the step rate (%error= -20.5,-30.3). SIGNIFICANCE A wrist-worn ActiGraph can accurately identify different physical activity intensity levels in older people, but lower cut-off points in older people should be adopted. To measure step rate, a hip-mounted ActiGraph is preferable than a wrist- worn one. A smartphone employing Google Fit generally underestimates step rate but it gives a relatively more accurate estimation of step rate when the older people walk at a speed of 4-8 km/h.","Kwan, Rick Yiu Cho; Liu, Justina Yat Wa; Lee, Deborah; Tse, Choi Yeung Andy; Lee, Paul Hong",Gait & posture,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gaitpost.2020.09.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33007688/,451

In the present study, the neuroprotective role of DEX on cerebral ischemic injury and the underlining signaling mechanisms were explored. In order to simulate cerebral ischemic injury, we performed middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice and oxygen-glucose deprivation in neurons. Immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis, and RT-qPCR were used to examine expression of HDAC5, NPAS4, MDM2, and PSD-95 in hippocampus tissues of MCAO mice and OGD-treated neurons. MCAO mice received treatment with DEX and sh-PSD-95, followed by neurological function evaluation, behavioral test, infarct volume detection by TTC staining, and apoptosis by TUNEL staining. Additionally, gain- and loss-of-function approaches were conducted in OGD-treated neuron after DEX treatment. Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed with the application of CCK-8 and flow cytometry. The interaction between MDM2 and PSD-95 was evaluated using Co-IP assay, followed by ubiquitination of PSD-95 detection. As per the results, HDAC5 and MDM2 were abundantly expressed, while NPAS4 and PSD-95 were poorly expressed in hippocampus tissues of MCAO mice and OGD-treated neurons. DEX elevated viability, and reduced LDH leakage rate and apoptosis rate of OGD-treated neurons, which was reversed following the overexpression of HDAC5. Moreover, HDAC5 augmented MDM2 expression via NPAS4 inhibition. MDM2 induced PSD-95 ubiquitination and degradation. In MCAO mice, DEX improved neurological function and behaviors and decreased infarct volume and apoptosis, which was negated as a result of PSD-95 silencing. DEX plays a neuroprotective role against cerebral ischemic injury by disrupting MDM2-induced PSD-95 ubiquitination and degradation via HDAC5 and NPAS4.","Lv, Hu; Li, Ying; Cheng, Qian; Chen, Jiawei; Chen, Wei",Molecular neurobiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-020-02223-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411316/,451

Literature review and contribution of our group in telematic care.,2021-04-30,"BACKGROUND The use of minimally and non-invasive monitoring systems (including continuous glucose monitoring) has increased rapidly over recent years. Up to now, it remains unclear how accurate devices can detect hypoglycaemic episodes. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we assessed the diagnostic accuracy of minimally and non-invasive hypoglycaemia detection in comparison to capillary or venous blood glucose in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. METHODS Clinical Trials.gov, Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus and Web of Science were systematically searched. Two authors independently screened the articles, extracted data using a standardised extraction form and assessed methodological quality using a review-tailored quality assessment tool for diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS-2). The diagnostic accuracy of hypoglycaemia detection was analysed via meta-analysis using a bivariate random effects model and meta-regression with regard to pre-specified covariates. RESULTS We identified 3416 nonduplicate articles. Finally, 15 studies with a total of 733 patients were included. Different thresholds for hypoglycaemia detection ranging from 40 to 100 mg/dl were used. Pooled analysis revealed a mean sensitivity of 69.3% [95% CI: 56.8 to 79.4] and a mean specificity of 93.3% [95% CI: 88.2 to 96.3]. Meta-regression analyses showed a better hypoglycaemia detection in studies indicating a higher overall accuracy, whereas year of publication did not significantly influence diagnostic accuracy. An additional analysis shows the absence of evidence for a better performance of the most recent generation of devices. CONCLUSION Overall, the present data suggest that minimally and non-invasive monitoring systems are not sufficiently accurate for detecting hypoglycaemia in routine use.

138891,A genome-wide association study of emotion dysregulation: Evidence for interleukin 2 receptor alpha.,2016,"OBJECTIVES Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is commonly experienced in the aftermath of major incidents such as terrorism and pandemics. Well-established principles of response include effective and scalable treatment for individuals affected by PTSD. In England, such responses have combined proactive outreach, screening and evidence-based interventions (a 'screen-and-treat' approach), but little is known about its cost-effectiveness. The objective of this paper is to report the first systematic attempt to assess the cost-effectiveness of this approach. METHODS A decision modelling analysis was undertaken to estimate the costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained from a screen-and-treat approach compared with treatment-as-usual, the latter involving identification of PTSD by general practitioners and referral to psychological therapy services. Model input variables were drawn from relevant empirical studies in the context of terrorism and the unit costs of health and social care in England. The model was run over a 5-year time horizon for a hypothetical cohort of 1000 exposed adults from the perspective of the National Health Service and Personal Social Services in England. RESULTS The incremental cost per QALY gained was £7931. This would be considered cost-effective 88% of the time at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20 000 per QALY gained, the threshold associated with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in England. Sensitivity analysis confirmed this result was robust. CONCLUSIONS A screen-and-treat approach for identifying and treating PTSD in adults following terrorist attacks appears cost-effective in England compared with treatment-as-usual through conventional primary care routes. Although this finding was in the context of terrorism, the implications might be translatable into other major incident-related scenarios including the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Hogan, Nicole; Knapp, Martin; McDaid, David; Davies, Mark; Brewin, Chris R",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049472; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34620659/,451

METHODS We retrospectively identified 62 patients with type II endoleak who underwent early CTA in mean 3.7 ± 1.9 days after EVAR. On the basis of follow-up examinations (mean follow-up period 911 days; range, 373-1,987 days), patients were stratified into two groups: those who did (n = 18) and those who did not (n = 44) require reintervention. CTA characteristics, such as AAA, endoleak, as well as nidus dimensions, patency of the inferior mesenteric artery, number of aortic branch vessels, and the pattern of endoleak appearance, were recorded and correlated with the clinical outcome. RESULTS Univariate and receiver operating characteristic curve regression analyses revealed significant differences between the two groups for the endoleak volume (surveillance group: 1391.6 ± 1427.9 mm(3); reintervention group: 3227.7 ± 2693.8 mm(3); cutoff value of 2,386 mm(3); p = 0.002), the endoleak diameter (13.6 ± 4.3 mm compared with 25.9 ± 9.6 mm; cutoff value of 19 mm; p < 0.0001), the number of aortic branch vessels (2.9 ± 1.2 compared with 4.2 ± 1.4 vessels; p = 0.001), as well as a ""complex type"" endoleak pattern (13.6 %, n = 6 compared with 44.4 %, n = 8; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS Early CTA can predict the future need for reintervention in patients with type II endoleak.

However, this has not been reported for paediatric endocrinology services in the UK. We aimed to test feasibility and acceptability through a first cycle of a national peer review of paediatric endocrine services. METHODS Tertiary centres in paediatric endocrinology across the UK were assessed against 54 quality standards, developed by the British Society for Paediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes (BSPED) in five domains of healthcare by a team comprising paediatric endocrinologists and specialist nurses. The evaluation was supported by a self-assessment. A post-peer-review questionnaire was used as feedback. RESULTS All 22 centres in the UK underwent independent peer review between 2011 and 2017. Each served a median population of 2.6 million (range 1-8 million) and offered 1,872 (range 779-6,738) outpatient consultations annually. A total of 43 (range 30-49) standards were met in combined evaluation of all centres. Variance of adherence for essential standards ranged from 52 to 97% at individual centres with 90% adherence demonstrated by 32% of centres. Post-review feedback showed 20/22 (95%) validating the utility of the peer review.

A 70-year-old Caucasian woman, gravida 3, para 2 had symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse (POP) apical/anterior stage III. At pelvic ultrasound evaluation, the uterus was small and normal appearing of adnexa bilaterally. She failed pessaries and is sexually active. The most relevant complaints were vaginal bulging and pressure. She denied urinary incontinence. During the surgery, we used (1) 3-0, V-Loc™ (Covidien) and we reinforced these absorbable sutures with (2) 2-0, GORE-TEX® Suture (Gore Medical). The Si da Vinci Surgical System was used with 4 arms and 5 trocars configuration, docked on the patient's left side. On the right/left apical support, we used V-Loc and Gore-Tex and these provided the initial 2 points suspension on the uterosacral ligaments (USL). We like to attach the left to the right USL. We then developed the space between the bladder and vagina and proceed with a plication of the pubocervical fascia with V-loc sutures. Two anterior apical support sutures were taken from the vagina to the transversalis fascia on the anterior abdominal wall and then hid behind the bladder peritoneum. The tension of these sutures was maintained with Hem-o-lock (TeleFlex) and LAPRA-TY (Ethicon).

RESULTS A total number of 6373 hysterectomy patient cases were included in this study: 88.7% (5653) were European American (EA), 11.02% (702) were African American (AA), and the remaining 0.28% (18) were of other ethnicities. We found that non-EA, women aged 45-60, traditional Medicaid, and traditional Medicare enrollees were more likely to have a total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH). Residence in higher median income zip code (> $61,000) was associated with 60% lower odds of undergoing TAH. Both FY 2013 and 2014 were associated with significantly lower odds of TAH. Logistic regression results from the model for non-EA patients for FY 2012 and FY 2014 demonstrated that FY and zip code income group were not significant predictors of surgery type in this subgroup. Pathway implementation did not reduce racial disparity in MIH utilization. CONCLUSION This study demonstrated that there is a significant disparity in MIH utilization, where non-EA and Medicaid/Medicare recipients had higher odds of undergoing TAH. Further research is needed to investigate how care standardization may alleviate healthcare disparities.","Sanei-Moghaddam, Amin; Kang, Chaeryon; Edwards, Robert P; Lounder, Paula J; Ismail, Naveed; Goughnour, Sharon L; Mansuria, Suketu M; Comerci, John T; Linkov, Faina",Journal of racial and ethnic health disparities,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-017-0420-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28840507/,451

The mechanisms by which the B cells responsible for producing protective antibodies are elicited to respond are not well understood. Interclonal B cell competition to complex antigens, particularly in germinal centers, has emerged as an important hurdle in designing effective vaccines. This review will focus on recent advances in understanding the roles of B cell precursor frequency, B cell receptor affinity for antigen, antigen avidity, and other factors that can substantially alter the outcomes of B cell responses to complex antigens. Understanding the interdependence of these fundamental factors that affect B cell responses can inform current vaccine design efforts for pathogens with complex proteins as candidate immunogens such as HIV, influenza, and coronaviruses.","Abbott, Robert K; Crotty, Shane",Immunological reviews,https://doi.org/10.1111/imr.12861; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32483855/,451

To assist with the translation process and better harmonize the outcomes of existing clinical decision support tools, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) created clinical decision support for immunization (CDSi) resources for each set of ACIP recommendations. These resources are continually updated and refined as new vaccine recommendations and clarifications become available and will be available to health information systems for a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine when one becomes available for use in the United States Objectives: To assess awareness of CDSi resources, whether CDSi resources were being used by immunization-related health information systems, and perceived impact of CDSi resources on stakeholders' work Design: Online surveys conducted from 2015-2019 including qualitative and quantitative questions Participants: The main and technical contact from each of the 64 CDC-funded immunization information system (IIS) awardees, IIS vendors, and electronic health record vendors Results: Awareness of at least one resource increased from 75% of respondents in 2015 to 100% in 2019. Use of at least one CDSi resource also increased from 47% in 2015 to 78% in 2019. About 80% or more of users of CDSi are somewhat or very highly satisfied with the resources and report a somewhat or very positive impact from using them Conclusion: As awareness and use of CDSi resources increases, the likelihood that patients receive recommended immunizations at the right time will also increase. Rapid and precise integration of vaccine recommendations into health information systems will be particularly important when a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available to help facilitate vaccine implementation.","Shrader, Lauren; Myerburg, Stuart; Larson, Eric",Online journal of public health informatics,https://doi.org/10.5210/ojphi.v12i1.10602; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32908644/,451

Despite a significant progress in administration of biological agents for RA patients, there is still a need for improved therapy. Intravenous-immunoglobulins (IVIG) , a pooled polyspecific immunoglobulin-G (IgG) extracted from 5,000-20,000 healthy subjects, showed beneficial therapeutic effect in patients with immune-deficiency, sepsis, and autoimmune diseases. The current study aim to investigate the beneficial effect of treatment with IVIG in established collagen induced arthritis in DBA/1j mice. Murine arthritis was induced in DBA/1j mice. The treatment with IVIG started when the disease was established. The clinical score was followed twice a week until day 48. The mice were bled for plasma, the paws were H&E stained. Cytokine profile in the plasma was analyzed by Luminex technology, titers of circulating anti-collagen antibodies in the plasma was tested by ELISA. Our results show that treatment with IVIG in murine, significantly rreduced the clinical arthritis score (P<0.001). Moreover, mode of action show that IVIG significantly reduced circulating level of inflammatory cytokines (IFNγ, IL-1β, IL-17, IL-6, TNFα) (P<0.001), inhibit anti-collagen antibodies (P < 0.001) in the plasma of CIA mice. Importantly, histopathological examination revealed that IVIG treatment prevented the migration of inflammatory immune cells into the cartilage and synovium, reduced the extent of joint damage and preserved joint architecture. Our results proved for the first time the valuable anti-inflammatory treatment of IVIG in experimental RA. We propose IVIG therapy for a subgroup of patients with as rheumatologically-related diseases.","Halpert, Gilad; Katz, Itai; Shovman, Ora; Tarasov, Sergey; Ganina, Ksenia Kirillovna; Petrova, Nataliia; Tocut, Milena; Volkov, Alexander; Barshack, Iris; Blank, Miri; Amital, Howard",Clinical and experimental immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/cei.13532; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33020923/,451

It is characterized by anemia, arthritis, cutaneous inflammation, recurrent infections, growth failure, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, hyperzincemia/hypercalprotectinemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated inflammatory indicators. This study describes the cases of two pediatric female patients with long-standing recurrent arthralgia in different parts of the extremities and severe anemia, respectively, who were misdiagnosed and treated for aseptic necrosis of the femoral head and severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia, respectively. High-throughput sequencing analysis revealed a de novo heterozygous missense mutation (c.748G > A, p.

The patients were treated with prednisone and etanercept, which improved their symptoms, but neutropenia remained unchanged. These cases highlight the importance of genetic assessment for the accurate diagnosis of PAMI and to ensure adequate and timely treatment of these patients.","Xu, Xue-Mei; Huang, Hua; Ding, Fei; Yang, Zhen; Wang, Jian; Jin, Yan-Liang",American journal of medical genetics.

161482,Surveying willingness towards SARS-CoV-2 vaccination of healthcare workers in Italy.,2021-04-26,"PURPOSE The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in major life disruptions for sexual minority adolescents (SMAs), who already face and cope with pervasive and disproportionate rates of social, behavioral, and mental health challenges. Current research suggests that SMAs are struggling with COVID-19-related shelter in place orders navigating family proximity and dynamics and experiencing isolation from SMA-specific supports. Given identified challenges that may exacerbate known mental health disparities in SMAs, this work explores self-care practices among SMAs during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS The present study uses data from open-ended questions to understand SMA experiences of self-care within a nationwide sample of SMAs (N = 770; M = 17.48 years, SD = 1.00) who are part of an ongoing prospective study. Data were collected via online questionnaire between May 13 and 31, 2020. Thematic analysis guided data exploration. RESULTS Thematic analysis revealed five self-care practices among SMAs: (1) relationships, (2) routines, (3) body and mind, (4) rest and reset, and (5) tuning out. SMAs engaged in many positive coping strategies (i.e., exercise, establishing routine) and often linked these activities to positive well-being. Other SMAs engaged in activities to distract or disengage from stressors (i.e., excessive TV and alcohol and drug use). CONCLUSIONS These findings highlight the resiliency of SMAs during the current pandemic, opportunities for providers to emphasize adaptive coping skills with youths, and the need for more research on adolescent self-care practices.","O'Brien, Rory P; Parra, Luis A; Cederbaum, Julie A",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.03.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33875330/,451

We used a systems-level approach combined with glycan array technology to decipher the repertoire of carbohydrate-specific IgG antibodies in intravenous and subcutaneous immunoglobulin preparations. A strikingly universal architecture of this repertoire with modular organization among different donor populations revealed an association between immunogenicity or tolerance and particular structural features of glycans. Antibodies were identified with specificity not only for microbial antigens but also for a broad spectrum of host glycans that serve as attachment sites for viral and bacterial pathogens and/or exotoxins. Tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens were differentially detected by IgG antibodies, whereas non-IgG2 reactivity was predominantly absent. Our study highlights the power of systems biology approaches to analyze immune responses and reveals potential glycan antigen determinants that are relevant to vaccine design, diagnostic assays, and antibody-based therapies.","Schneider, Christoph; Smith, David F; Cummings, Richard D; Boligan, Kayluz Frias; Hamilton, Robert G; Bochner, Bruce S; Miescher, Sylvia; Simon, Hans-Uwe; Pashov, Anastas; Vassilev, Tchavdar; von Gunten, Stephan",Science translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.3010524; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25568069/,451

We evaluated home-time as a patient-centered outcome in Medicare beneficiaries with ischemic stroke in comparison with modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 90 days and at 1 year post event. METHODS Patients enrolled in Get With The Guidelines-Stroke (GWTG-Stroke) and Adherence Evaluation After Ischemic Stroke-Longitudinal (AVAIL) registries were linked to Medicare claims to ascertain home-time, defined as time spent alive and out of a hospital, inpatient rehabilitation, or skilled nursing facilities, at 90 days and at 1 year after admission. The correlation of home-time with mRS at 90 days and at 1 year was evaluated by Pearson correlation coefficients, and the ability of home-time to discriminate mRS (0-2) was assessed by c-index. RESULTS There were 815 patients with ischemic stroke (age median, 76 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 70-82]; 46% women; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale median, 4 [IQR, 2-7]) from 88 hospitals. The 90-day and 1-year median home-times were 79 (IQR, 52-86) days and 349 (IQR, 303-360) days and median mRS were 2 (IQR, 1-4) and 2 (IQR, 1-4). Greater home-time within 90 days was significantly correlated with lower 90-day mRS (Pearson correlation coefficient, -0.731; P<0.0001) and showed strong ability to discriminate functional independence with mRS 0 to 2 (c-index, 0.837). Similar findings were observed at 1 year. CONCLUSIONS In a population of older patients with ischemic stroke, home-time was readily available from administrative data and associated with mRS at 90 days and 1 year.

162935,Shared Genetic Background Between Sars-CoV-2 Infection and Ischemic and Hemorrhagic Stroke,2021,"SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, drastically modifies the cells that it infects. One such effect is the activation of the host p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which plays a major role in inflammation pathways that are dysregulated in severe COVID-19 cases. Inhibition of p38/MAPK activity in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells reduces both cytokine production and viral replication. Here, we applied a systems biology approach to better understand interactions between the p38/MAPK pathway and SARS-CoV-2 in human lung epithelial cells. We found several components of the p38/MAPK pathway positively and negatively impact SARS-CoV-2 infection and that p38ß is a required host factor for SARS-CoV-2 that acts by promoting viral protein translation in a manner that prevents innate immune sensing. Furthermore, we combined chemical and genetic perturbations of p38ß with quantitative phosphoproteomics to identify novel, putative p38ß substrates in an unbiased manner, with broad relevance beyond SARS-CoV-2 biology.","Higgins, Christina A.; Nilsson-Payant, Benjamin E.; Kurland, Andrew P.; Adhikary, Prithy; Golynker, Ilona; Danziger, Oded; Panis, Maryline; Rosenberg, Brad R.; tenOever, Benjamin; Johnson, Jeffrey R.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.20.457146,451

M1-like macrophages control intracellular bacterial pathogens and tumor progression. In contrast, M2-like macrophages shape reparative microenvironments that can be conducive for pathogen survival or tumor growth. An imbalance of these macrophages phenotypes may perpetuate sites of chronic unresolved inflammation, such as infectious granulomas and solid tumors. We have found that plant-derived and synthetic rocaglates sensitize macrophages to low concentrations of the M1-inducing cytokine IFN-gamma and inhibit their responsiveness to IL-4, a prototypical activator of the M2-like phenotype. Treatement of primary macrophages with rocaglates increased their resilience to oxidative stress, stimulated autophagy and killing of intracellular mycobacteria. Thus, rocaglates represent a novel class of immunomodulators that can direct macrophage polarization towards the M1-like phenotype in complex microenvironments associated with hypofunction of type 1 and/or hyperactivation of type 2 immunity, e.g. chronic bacterial infections, allergies and, possibly, certain tumors.","Chatterjee, Sujoy; Yabaji, Shivraj M.; Bhattacharya, Bidisha; Waligurski, Emily; Vallavoju, Nandini; Ray, Somak; Brown, Lauren E.; Beeler, Aaron B.; Ivanov, Alexander R.; Kobzik, Lester; Porco, John A.; Kramnik, Igor",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/691808,451

A total of 92% responded with at least somewhat agree in feeling that education was well rounded and provided in many forms prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with only 39% since the pandemic. A total of 88% felt at least somewhat positively about their gynecologic surgical volume prior to the pandemic, compared with only 30% since the pandemic. A total of 66% of respondents recorded that they at least somewhat enjoy virtual didactics. When asked about improvements in education during the pandemic, 32 respondents listed coordination of didactics, 30 listed having more time available, and 27 listed the specific didactic topics. When asked about their biggest concern with education due to the pandemic, 56 respondents listed surgical skill, 31 listed meeting numbers required for graduation, and 31 listed less gynecology experience.

The results therefore have failed to provide clinicians and the general public with consistent and useful information on which to base reliable food-related health decisions. This is particularly relevant regarding plastic-derived chemicals (PDCs) such as Bisphenol A now that the federal CLARITY-BPA program has failed to achieve scientific consensus. Investigators propose a novel human dietary protocol that is both replicable and causal, based upon BPA's demonstrated inflammatory effects in humans. This first-of-a-kind dietary intervention study explores a potential causal relationship between human serum levels of BPA and High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP) a proven clinical indicator of inflammation. Investigators used the equivalent of a USDA-defined typical diet followed by a PDC-reduced diet to compare blood levels of hsCRP. This proof-of-concept investigation is the first to use an easily accessible medically-accepted clinical laboratory test to directly measure human health effects of PDC reduction. Unexpected new complications discovered during the investigation indicate that these results may yet be inconclusive for direct causal relationship.

Extant public service messaging focuses on creating social norms around mask wearing. Drawing on protection motivation theory, we conduct a copy test to determine whether focusing on the physical risks or focusing on the social risks of contracting COVID‐19 is more persuasive in motivating mask wearing. We find that physical risk messaging is more persuasive than social risk messaging and find that the effect is partially mediated by fear of COVID‐19. The mediation is moderated by germ aversion. Specifically, we find people who are high in germ aversion respond to both physical and social risk messaging. However, people low in germ aversion respond only to physical risk messaging—and these are the people who are less likely to wear masks.

The world has seen a reduction in production capacity due to the closure of borders between countries and the introduction of self-isolation. The coronavims pandemic has disrupted the usual relationship between manufacturers and users and has made a major difference in transport. Such changes have been reflected in the regulation of relations regarding civil and criminal liability for offenses in the field of transport relations in a coronavirus pandemic. With this in mind, it is important to analyze the transformations of civil and criminal liability in the field of transport due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The work aims to analyze the civil and criminal liability in the field of transport relations due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The object of the study is a civil and criminal liability in the field of transport due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The subject of the study is the public relations that arise, change, and end during the prosecution of civil and criminal transport in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The research methodology consists of such methods as the analytical method, historical method, method of analysis of legal documents, articles, and monographs, method of generalization, comparison, synthesis, and modeling. The study will analyze the changes that have taken place in the field of transport, namely the peculiarities of civil and criminal liability for violations in the field of transport during the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as clarify the problematic issues of prosecution in the field of transport and controversial aspects pre-trial settlement of conflicts by the parties. The research also identified the main trends in the transport sphere in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic and explained what changes need to be made to establish a mechanism for civil and criminal liability in the field of transport due to the Covid-19 pandemic.","Minchenko, R.; Lutsyuk, P.; Kamensky, D.; Kolodin, A.; Shamota, O.",Amazonia Investiga,https://doi.org/10.34069/ai/2021.40.04.21,451
169505,Covid-19 Associated Hepatitis in children (CACH) during the second wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Central India: Is it a complication or transient phenomenon.,2021-07-29,"Background Alfaxalone is a fast acting intravenous anesthetic with high therapeutic index. It is an analogue of the naturally-occurring neurosteroid, allopregnanolone which has been implicated in causing neuroprotection, neurogenesis and preservation of cognition, through activation of pregnane X receptors in the central nervous system. This study investigated whether alfaxalone can activate human pregnane X receptors (h-PXR) as effectively as allopregnanolone. Methods Allopregnanolone and alfaxalone were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to make allopregnanolone and alfaxalone treatment solutions (serial 3-fold dilution concentration range, 50,000 – 206 nM). Activation of h-PXR by these ligand solutions compared with vehicle control was measured by an in-vitro method using human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) expressing h-PXR hybridised and linked to the firefly luciferase gene. Ligand binding with and activation of h-PXR in those cells caused downstream changes in luciferase activity and light emission. That activity was measured as relative light units using a plate-reading luminometer, thus quantifying the changes in h-PXR activity caused by the ligand applied to the HEK293 cells. Ligand log concentration response curves were constructed to compare efficacy and potency of allopregnanolone and alfaxalone. Results Allopregnanolone and alfaxalone both activated the h-PXR to cause dose-related light emission by the linked firefly luciferase. Control solutions (0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide) produced low level light emissions. Equimolar concentrations of alfaxalone were more efficacious in activation of h-PXR: 50,000 nM, p = 0.0019; 16,700 nM, p = 0.0472; 5,600 nM, p = 0.0031 [Brown-Forsythe and Welch ANOVA]. Conclusions Alfaxalone activates human-pregnane X receptors with greater efficacy compared with the endogenous ligand allopregnanolone. These results suggest that alfaxalone sedation and anesthesia may be accompanied by beneficial effects normally caused by the physiological effects of allopregnanolone, namely neuroprotection, neurogenesis, and preservation of cognition.","Serrao, Juliet.M.; Goodchild, Colin.S.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.05.284075,451

We report two exceptionally long (957 nt and 1536 nt), evolutionarily novel, translated antisense open reading frames (ORFs) embedded within annotated genes in the medically important Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both OLG pairs show sequence features consistent with being genes and transcriptional signals in RNA sequencing data. Translation of both OLGs was confirmed by ribosome profiling and mass spectrometry. Quantitative proteomics of samples taken during different phases of growth revealed regulation of protein abundances, implying biological functionality. Both OLGs are taxonomically highly restricted, and likely arose by overprinting within the genus. Evidence for purifying selection further supports functionality. The OLGs reported here are the longest yet proposed in prokaryotes and are among the best attested in terms of translation and evolutionary constraint. These results highlight a potentially large unexplored dimension of prokaryotic genomes.","Kreitmeier, Michaela; Ardern, Zachary; Abele, Miriam; Ludwig, Christina; Scherer, Siegfried; Neuhaus, Klaus",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.09.430400,451

This was a documentary type study, which investigated the fake news inserted in the Coronaverificado.news platform until February 27, 2021, totaling 938 news items, which were submitted to the IRaMuTeQ software, resulting in the Descending Hierarchical Classification. This enabled the clarification of four thematic categories analyzed with theoretical and methodological support from Hermeneutics-dialectics. The results revealed social networks as the most used vehicles for sending fake news (n=625;66.6%), whose contents were predominantly texts (n=488;52%). In the categorization of subjects, “Government and authorities” was the category that concentrated the most widespread subjects (56.6%), followed by “Development and application of vaccines” (14.8%), revealing the multifaceted scope and intention of the fake news items, which confuse the population and encourage adherence to unsafe practices. It is essential that the mass media function as a vehicle for reliable scientific and technical content about COVID-19's coping actions, since true communication associated with the ethical commitment of government officials will help to reduce the risk of people's inappropriate behavior, aiding the conscious adoption of measures that promote overall health in the pandemic and post-pandemic context. © 2021 Centro Universitario Sao Camilo.

172361,Ultrastructural analysis of nasopharyngeal epithelial cells from patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection,2021-07-08,"This paper draws on the theoretical framework based on social innovation determinants to analyze how and to what extent the recent and self-organized initiatives for food provisioning are contributing to increase food accessibility at the time of personal and mobility restrictions due to Covid-19. Based on this, the paper firstly maps the initiatives activated during the first months of the Covid-19 emergency (March and April 2020) in the urban-rural territories in the province of Naples (Italy). Secondly, it characterizes these initiatives in relation to their capacity to enhance outcome and social well-being, as well as to involve local society in answer to social challenges through a desk research. Thirdly, the paper describes the case of Masseria Ferraioli, which emerges as social innovative best practice among the previous mapped initiatives. Even in these days, the Masseria distributes to people who cannot afford the purchase due to the emergency vegetables grown on land confiscated from the Camorra, the local mafia. Its configuration as social innovative experience is also confirmed directly by the Masserias project manager, who was required to answer to a semi-structured interview. Based on the evidence of the desk research and this interview, the paper demonstrates the importance of the combined commitment of local communities and volunteering association as a reaction to food provisioning problems in the time of Covid-19, as well as an increasing interest in reconnecting with local food practices, above all when food access has become a priority.","Cattivelli, Valentina; Rusciano, Vincenzo",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su12114444,451

The EP has exploited any opportunity to enhance these powers: In particular, the EP has a record of using crisis and extraordinary situations to expand its role beyond the formal prerogatives given to the institution. Following this literature, this article examines the role and influence of the EP on economic and fiscal policy, focusing on the response to the Covid-19 crisis. Negotiation of the Recovery and Resilience Facility presents an auspicious area to analyse the strategies implemented by the EP to influence the outcome and reinforce its position in EU economic governance. The article will look specifically at the formal and informal mechanisms used by the EP during the crisis to expand its powers. Moreover, it utilises a research design that combines the content analysis of several official/public documents and statements from key members of the European Parliament (MEPs) involved in economic policy.","Carlos Closa, Montero Felipe González deLeón Gisela Hernández González",Politics and Governance,https://doi.org/10.17645/pag.v9i3.4243,451

Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in expected 290 participants: 230 patients and 60 medical staff, during the four-month national COVID-19 outbreak period (Aug-Sep 2020, and Dec 2020-Jan 2021). All participants underwent both rapid antibody tests and RT-PCR (at admission for patients). Results A total of 270 participants completed the study. Fever and URI symptoms were present in 6/210 patients (2.8%) while one patient (0.5%) had a history of traveling to a high-risk area. However, only two (1%) asymptomatic patients had positive IgM results. Concerning the medical personnel, 10% fell into the patient under investigation (PUI) category. 4/60 (6.7%) IgM positive was observed in the staff cohort in which 3/4 came from non-PUI participants. Neither participant had RT-PCR positive demonstrating a 1.9% total false positive rate.

175506,Seropositivity to Nucleoprotein to detect SARS-CoV-2 infections: a tool to detect breakthrough infections after COVID-19 vaccination,2021-10-07,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of sex-specific female cancer death in the United States. Detection at earlier stages contributes to decrease the mortality rate. The mammography is considered the gold standard for breast cancer screening with an estimate sensitivity of 86.9% and a specificity 88.9%. However, these values are negatively affected by the breast, which is consider a risk factor for developing breast cancer. Herein, we validate the novel LED-based FDA Class I medical device Pink Luminous Breast (PLB) by the comparison of two breast screening imaging-based tests using a double blinded approach. The PLB works by emitting a LED red light with a harmless spectrum of 640-800 nanometers, the trans-illuminated breast tissue allows the observation of abnormalities represented by darker or shadowing areas. In this study, we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of the PLB device as a screening tool for the early detection of breast abnormalities when compared with the mammography as the gold standard. Our results showed that PLB device has a high sensitivity (89.6%) and specificity (96.4%) for detecting breast abnormalities comparable to the adjusted mammography values: 86.3% and 68.9% respectively. Importantly, the percentage of positive dense tissue findings from a total of 340 events was 266 (78.2%) using PLB vs. 248 (72.9%) detected by the mammography. A 100% of the participants responded in a survey that they feel comfortable using the device and visualizing their breast without feeling pain or discomfort during the examination. The PLB positive validation vs the mammography brings the potential to be recommended for routinely breast screening at non-clinical settings. The PLB provides a rapid, non-invasive, portable, and easy-to-use tool for breast screening that can complement the home-based BSE technique or the CBE. In addition, the PLB can be conveniently used for screening breasts with surgical implants. PLB provides an accessible and painless breast cancer screening tool. The use of this device is not intended to replace the mammography as the gold standard for breast screening but rather to use it as an adjunct or complement tool as part of more efficient earlier detection strategies and contribute to decrease this health disparity.","Ocasio-Villa, F.; Morales-Torres, L.; Velez-Medina, N.; Orengo, J.

The cytokine release syndrome was underlined as a culprit for severe outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays a crucial role in human immune responses and elevated IL-6 plasma levels have been associated with the exacerbated COVID-19 pathology. Since non-structural protein 10 (NSP10) of SARS-CoV-2 has been implicated in the induction of IL-6, we designed Peptide (P)1, containing sequences corresponding to amino acids 68-96 of NSP10, and examined its effect on cultured human cells. Treatment with P1 strongly increased IL-6 secretion by the lung cancer cell line NCI-H1792 and the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and revealed profound cytotoxic activity on Caco-2 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells. Treatment with P2, harbouring a mutation in the zinc knuckle motif of NSP10, caused no IL-6 induction and no cytotoxicity. Pre-treatment with plant-produced human anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-37b and IL-38 effectively mitigated the induction of IL-6 secretion. Our results suggest a role for the zinc knuckle motif of NSP10 in the onset of increased IL-6 plasma levels of COVID-19 patients and for IL-37b and IL-38 as therapeutics aimed at attenuating the cytokine release syndrome.","Anborgh, Pieter H.; Kolotilin, Igor; Owens, Nisha; Mahboob, Abdulla Azzam",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.14.460246,451

Upon the declaration of COVID 19 as a pandemic, learning activities were abruptly shifted from the in-person to virtual classroom activities. The transition required changes in the strategies and methods/styles of teaching. Despite the success in most of the activities, classroom interactions and assessments of students' work emerged as areas that deserve more attention. The objective of this study is to develop a pilot project aimed at maintaining acceptable and secured levels of interactions and assessments. The setting for this study includes virtual classroom interactions, peer level tutoring sessions, and formative assessments. To improve the interactions, efficacious assessment methods deploying incremental levels of thinking were used. This requires a third-party program for embedding questions on prerecorded lectures. The questions were then randomized and assigned to the subjects. The use of hierarchical randomization of multiple-choice questions for the short quizzes resulted in reduction of cheating. The performance of the students in the four sections of a calculus course used for this project improved by 17%. For complete eradication of cheating, the midterm was returned from online back to the traditional classrooms. Such move will include the final exam in mid-December. © 2020 IEEE.","Abuelyaman, E.

The aim of this review protocol is to update the first systematic review conducted by Priest et al. 2013, including a meta-analysis of findings. Based on previous empirical data, it is anticipated that child and adolescent health will be negatively impacted by racism. This review will provide updated evidence of effect sizes across outcomes and identify moderators and mediators of relationships. Methods and analysis: This systematic review and meta-analysis will include studies that explore associations between experiences of racism and racial dissemination with health outcomes of children and adolescents aged 0-24 years of age from any racial/ethnic/cultural group. Outcome measures include general health and wellbeing, physical health, mental health, healthcare utilisation and health behaviours. Exposure measures include self-reported and proxy reported personal experiences of racism and reported experiences of vicarious racism. The authors will conduct a comprehensive search of studies from the earliest time available to September 2020. All relevant studies will be screened with data extraction, quality appraisal and publication bias conducted independently by at least two authors. Ethics and Dissemination: This review will provide evidence for future research within the field and help to support policy and practice development.

Several anecdotical and theoretical evidences argued that lockdown measures would have increased subjective feelings of loneliness and addictions’ proneness.ObjectivesIn addition, preliminary data underlined a possible increase in the frequency of gaming and social media use. Increased loneliness levels are likely to account for increased gaming and social media addiction during the lockdown.MethodsWe conducted a longitudinal study administering to a sample of 154 Italian adults several self-report questionnaires at the beginning of lockdown (Time 1) and three days before the end of the lockdown (Time 2). We therefore assessed loneliness feelings, frequency of gaming and social media use as well as both gaming and social media addiction. Data were analysed using Structural Equation Modelling.ResultsWe observed that loneliness levels longitudinally predicted both gaming and social media addiction also controlling for gaming and social media use at Time 1.ConclusionsIncreased feelings of loneliness, a well-known risk factor for gaming and social media addiction, may be a central variable heightening vulnerability to the onset or the maintenance of technological addiction during forced social isolation. Thus, future prevention interventions may want to target this issue.","Zobel, S. Beomonte",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.1493,451

As of October 06, 2020, the number of cases worldwide was about 35,786,851 with 1,049,816 deaths. Unfortunately, no drug or vaccine has yet been approved to treat human coronaviruses. Several options can be envisaged to control or prevent emerging infections of COVID-19, including vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, oligonucleotide-based therapies, peptides, interferon therapies, and small molecule drugs. However, new interventions are likely to require months to years to develop. Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a functional receptor for SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Development of medications preventing the entry of the virus into host cells through ACE2 is a promising approach. Drug discovery and development is a challenging, time consuming, and expensive process. Computational tools can act as a virtual shortcut, assisting in the expedition of this long process and potentially reducing the cost of research and development. During this pandemic situation, in silico tools have proven their efficacy in easy identification of novel inhibitors. In the present chapter, recent researches on the application of computational modeling approaches for the design and identification of candidates targeted against ACE2-mediated corona viral entry have been reviewed. Computational works encompassing homology modelling, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, pharmacophore mapping, and quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) studies involving potential inhibitors of ACE2 facilitated entry of virus have been covered in this chapter.","De, P.; Roy, K.",Methods Pharmacol.

179532,SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) and role of real time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) in its diagnosis,2021,"Background: While several demographic and clinical correlates of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcome have been identified, they remain imprecise tools for clinical management of disease. Furthermore, there are limited data on how these factors are associated with virological and immunological parameters over time. Methods and Findings: Nasopharyngeal swabs and blood samples were longitudinally collected from a cohort of 58 hospitalized adults with COVID-19 in Chicago, Illinois between March 27 and June 9, 2020. Samples were assessed for SARS-CoV-2 viral load, viral genotype, viral diversity, and antibody titer. Demographic and clinical information, including patient blood tests and several composite measures of disease severity, were extracted from electronic health records. All parameters were assessed for association with three patient outcome groups: discharge without intensive care unit (ICU) admission (n = 23), discharge with ICU admission (n = 29), and COVID-19 related death (n = 6). Higher age, male sex, and higher body mass index (BMI) were significantly associated with ICU admission. At hospital admission, higher 4C Mortality scores and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were likewise associated with ICU admission. Longitudinal trends in Deterioration Index (DI) score, Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), and serum neutrophil count were also associated with ICU admission, though only the retrospectively calculated median DI score was predictive of death. While viral load and genotype were not significantly associated with outcome in this study, viral load did correlate positively with C-reactive protein levels and negatively with D-dimer, lymphocyte count, and antibody titer. Intra-host viral genetic diversity resulted in changes in viral genotype in some participants over time, though intra-host evolution was not associated with outcome. A stepwise-generated multivariable model including BMI, lymphocyte count at admission, and neutrophil count at admission was sufficient to predict outcome with a 0.82 accuracy rate in this cohort. Conclusions: These studies suggest that COVID-19 disease severity and poor outcomes among hospitalized patients are likely driven by dysfunctional host responses to infection and underlying co-morbid conditions rather than SARS-CoV-2 viral loads. Several parameters, including 4C mortality score, LDH levels, and DI score, were ultimately predictive of participant outcome and warrant further exploration in larger cohort studies for use in clinical management and risk assessment. Finally, the prevalence of intra-host diversity and viral evolution in hospitalized patients suggests a mechanism for population-level change, further emphasizing the need for effective antivirals to suppress viral replication and to avoid the emergence of new variants.","Simons, L.

181206,Protein-based RBD-C-tag COVID-19 Vaccination Candidate Elicits Protection Activity against SARS-COV-2 Variant Infection,2021-08-18,"Objectives: The aim of this study is to examine the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on quality of life among cystic fibrosis (CF) patients in Croatia. Methods: The study was conducted on a sample of 30 adults patients older than 19 years (17/30 female) and 42 paediatric patients with cystic fibrosis, from preschool children to 18 years (25/42 female). The patients were recruited from our CF Centre. Patients answered 15 short questions regarding their subjective perception of quality of life during the second wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Croatia. Results: None of the patients answered they were positive to SARS-CoV-2 during the second wave of the pandemic. Half of adult CF patients were concerned about the virus, but only one (3.3%) neglected a control visit to the doctor. 18/30 of adult were less active during the pandemic. 5/30 (16.7%) had more frequent exacerbations of the disease. Around one quarter (26.7%) lost weight, while half gained weight. Half of adult CF patients feel that their quality of life is significantly impaired during this pandemic. In paediatric patients, almost half of the questionnaires were answered by parents or guardians. In CF children (N = 42), about three quarters were concerned about the virus and one fifth neglected control. Three fifths of children were less active, and 2/42 had more frequent exacerbations. Weight loss was recorded in 5/42 (12%), and more than half gained weight. Half of paediatric patients have a poorer quality of life than before the pandemic. Conclusion: In our survey, we have shown both adults and children were less active and had more frequent CF exacerbations and a substantial number of them lost weight. To conclude, the overall quality of life in adults and children with cystic fibrosis was significantly impaired.","Odobasic Palkovic, T.; Milinkovic, T.; Markelic, I.; Džubur, F.; Godic, I.; Barbir, I.; Tjesic-Drinkovic, D.; Vukic-Dugac, A.",Journal of Cystic Fibrosis,https://doi.org/10.1016/s1569-1993(21)01246-7,451

We generated a chimeric protein that comprises the sequences of RBD from S and N antigens (SpiN). SpiN was highly immunogenic and elicited a strong IFNγ response from T cells and high levels of antibodies to the inactivated virus, but no neutralizing antibodies. Importantly, hamsters and the human Angiotensin Convertase Enzyme-2-transgenic mice immunized with SpiN were highly resistant to challenge with the wild type SARS-CoV-2, as indicated by viral load, clinical outcome, lung inflammation and lethality. Thus, the N protein should be considered to induce T-cell-based immunity to improve SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and eventually to circumvent the immune scape by variants.","Castro, Julia T.; Fumagalli, Marcílio J.; Hojo-Souza, Natalia S.; Azevedo, Patrick; Salazar, Natalia; Rattis, Bruna; Ramos, Simone G.; Faustino, Lídia; Almeida, Gregório G.; Oliveira, Livia I.; Marçal, Tomas G.; Augusto, Marconi; Magalhães, Rubens; Cassaro, Bruno; Burle, Gabriela; Doro, Daniel; Kalil, Jorge; Durigon, Edson; Salazar, Andrés; Caballero, Otávia; Machado, Alexandre; Silva, João S.; da Fonseca, Flávio; Fernandes, Ana Paula; Teixeira, Santuza R.; Gazzinelli, Ricardo T.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.16.460663,451

Birth Companion is an important part of the Labour room Quality Improvement (LaQshya) programme introduced by the Government of India in 2017. Despite mandates, implementation of the concept has been unsatisfactory (9%), even though the importance of Birth Companion has increased due to enhanced risk posed by COVID-19. Little is known about awareness among health care providers on Birth Companions, perceived barriers or their suggestions. Methods We canvassed a 15-question instrument using ordinal scales on 151 health care providers comprising consultants, post graduates, residents, and nurses (response rate 69%) in the department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Lok Nayak Hospital, Delhi, India to gauge their awareness and opinions about Birth Companions. Results Most health care providers across all categories were aware of the concept (93%), World Health Organization recommendation (83%) and Government instructions for its hospitals (68%) that every woman should be accompanied by a Birth Companion of her choice during labour. Birth Companions of choice suggested by them were the mother (70%), husband (69%). sister (46%) or nurse (43%). Most health care providers agreed that a Birth Companion should wear clean clothes (95%), be free from any communicable disease (91%), stay with the pregnant woman throughout the process of labour (74%) and should have herself gone though labour (42%). Almost all providers (95%) agreed that the presence of a Birth Companion during labour will be beneficial, as they would provide emotional support (99%), boost the confidence of the woman (98%), provide comfort measures like massage (95%), early initiation of breastfeeding (93%), reduce post-partum depression (91%), humanize labour (83%), reduce need for analgesia (70%) and increase spontaneous vaginal births (69%). Yet support for its introduction in their hospital was low (59%). Staff nurses had reservations (62%) with only 40% of those who believed Birth Companion to be beneficial approving of its introduction in their hospital. Over-crowding in labour room and privacy concerns for other women were identified as key barriers. Conclusion Even though most health care providers were aware of and convinced of multiple benefits of Birth Companion during labour, lack of adequate infrastructure in the labour room prevented them from supporting its introduction. Government should provide adequate funding to upgrade labour rooms in a way that provides privacy to the delivering women and frame guidelines and train Birth Companions to perform their role appropriately.

An important issue is also that there is still no unified standard for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. Substantial vascular events are significant accompaniments to lung complications in COVID-19 patients. Various papers have now also shown the significance of thromboelastrography (TEG) as point-of-care technology to determine the levels of coagulopathy (both clotting and bleeding) in COVID-19, in managing COVID-19 patients. Here we present two treatment protocols that may used to treat thrombotic and bleeding or thrombocytopenia pathologies. We also present a case study, where the thrombotic pathology was successfully treated with the thrombotic protocol. Both the protocols use clinical parameters like D-dimer and CRP, as well as the TEG, to closely follow the daily clotting propensity of COVID-19 patients. We conclude by suggesting that the treatment of COVID-19 patients, should be based on a combination of blood biomarkers, and results from point-of-care analyses like the TEG. Such a combination approach closely follow the physiological responses of the immune system, the haematological, as well as the coagulation system, in real-time.","Laubscher, G. J.; Lourens, P.

Methods and Findings: Data from 460 individuals collected in Spain between April and July 2020 was analyzed in a cross-sectional study: healthy, Sars-Cov-2 negative (group 0, N = 197), Sars-Cov-2 positive, with mild COVID-19 symptoms (group 1, N = 113), Sars-Cov-2 positive, with severe COVID-19 symptoms who required hospitalization (group 2, N = 150) at Hospital Universitario Cruces in Bilbao, Spain. Fasting blood glucose, HbA1c and serum 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG, indicator of hyperglycemic excursions over the prior 1-2 weeks) were measured. Differences in 1,5-AG (normal range >10µg/mL) were observed between all three groups (mean 1,5-AG of 21.19, 18.99, 14.64 µg/mL, respectively) when compared by an unpaired t-test. 1,5-AG levels across groups decreased with increasing severity, with the hospitalized patients (group 2) showing the greatest difference when compared to healthy individuals, p value < 0.0001. Logistic regression analysis showed that 1,5-AG had a mild positive association with increased COVID-19 severity (group 0 vs. group 2: AUC = 0.69, p value < 0.0001). A previous T2D diagnosis did not show association with COVID-19 severity (group 0 vs. group 2: AUC = 0.58, p value < 0.0001). Analysis of patients with a previous diagnosis of T2D showed a robust positive association between 1,5-AG and COVID-19 (group 0 vs. group 2, AUC = 0.79, p value 0.008). There was no association between HbA1c or fasting glucose with severity. Combination of 1,5-AG and HbA1c was similar than 1,5-AG alone (AUC = 0.80, p value 0.028). Conclusions: Glycemic fluctuations in T2D patients may contribute to severe COVID-19. Measurement of serum 1,5-AG in T2D patients might help clinicians quickly identify diabetes patients at risk of severe COVID-19. These patients may benefit from more intensive management, treatment and vaccine prioritization.","Sonia, Gaztambide Button Eric A.; Zulueta, Mirella Arana Eunate De La Hoz Ana B.; Mendizabal, Leire Del Olmo Juan Muñoz Raquel Simon Laureano Castano Luis",Diabetes,https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-146-lb,451

This paper makes use of the case study method to analyse the role of this kind of partnership in skills acquisition in five industrial development projects in Africa.

Recently, we identified a dilysine endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retrieval signal and a tyrosine-based endocytosis signal in the cytoplasmic tail of the S protein of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Here, an infectious cDNA clone of IBV was used to address the importance of the S protein trafficking signals to virus infection. We constructed infectious cDNA clones lacking the ER retrieval signal, the endocytosis signal, or both. The virus lacking the ER retrieval signal was viable. However, this virus had a growth defect at late times postinfection and produced larger plaques than IBV. Further analysis confirmed that the mutant S protein trafficked though the secretory pathway faster than wild-type S protein. A more dramatic phenotype was obtained when the endocytosis signal was mutated. Recombinant viruses lacking the endocytosis signal (in combination with a mutated dilysine signal or alone) could not be recovered, even though transient syncytia were formed in transfected cells. Our results suggest that the endocytosis signal of IBV S is essential for productive virus infection.","Youn, Soonjeon; Collisson, Ellen W; Machamer, Carolyn E",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16227244/,451

Recent studies suggest that SARS-CoV is zoonotic and may have a broad host range besides humans. Although the global outbreak of SARS has been contained, there are serious concerns over its re-emergence and bioterrorism potential. As a part of preparedness, development of a safe and effective vaccine is one of the highest priorities in fighting SARS. A number of candidate vaccines, using a variety of approaches, are under development. The first vaccine tested in clinical trial is made from the inactivated form of SARS-CoV. Several live attenuated, genetically engineered or vector vaccines encoding the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein have been in pre-clinical studies. These vaccine candidates are effective in terms of eliciting protective immunity in the vaccinated animals. However, caution should be taken with the safety of whole virus or full-length S protein-based immunogens in humans because they may induce harmful immune or inflammatory responses. We propose to use the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV S protein (residues 318--510) for developing a safe and effective subunit SARS vaccine, as it is not only a functional domain that mediates virus-receptor binding but also a major neutralization determinant of SARSCoV. It has been demonstrated that the RBD of SARS-CoV S protein contains multiple conformational epitopes capable of inducing highly potent neutralizing antibody responses and protective immunity.","He, Yuxian; Jiang, Shibo",Viral immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16035944/,451

Virions were mixed with liposomes along with the ectodomain of one of three gD receptors (HVEMt, nectin-1t, or nectin-2t) and incubated under different pH and temperature conditions. Virions failed to associate with liposomes in the presence of nectin-1 or nectin-2 at any temperature or pH tested. In contrast, HVEMt triggered association of HSV with liposomes at pH 5.3 or 5.0 when incubated at 37 degrees C, suggesting that HVEM binding and mildly acidic pH at a physiological temperature provide coactivation signals, allowing virus association with membranes. Virions incubated with HVEMt at 37 degrees C without liposomes rapidly lost infectivity upon exposure to pH 5.0, suggesting that these conditions lead to irreversible virus inactivation in the absence of target membranes. Consistent with the idea that soluble receptor molecules provide a trigger for HSV entry, HVEMt promoted virus entry into receptor-deficient CHO K1 cells. However, in B78H1 cells, HVEMt promoted virus entry with markedly lower efficiency. Interestingly, HSV entry into receptor-bearing CHO K1 cells has been shown to proceed via a pH-dependent manner, whereas HSV entry into receptor-bearing B78H1 cells is pH independent. Based on these observations, we propose that the changes triggered by HVEM and mildly acidic pH that allow liposome association are similar or identical to changes that occur during pH-dependent HSV entry.","Whitbeck, J Charles; Zuo, Yi; Milne, Richard S B; Cohen, Gary H; Eisenberg, Roselyn J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16571794/,451

The MHV-A59 nsp15 monomer structure has a novel protein fold. Two nsp15 trimers form a back-to-back hexamer that is believed to be the functional unit. The structure reveals the catalytic site including the highly conserved residues His262, His277, and Lys317, which is supported by mutagenesis analysis. Gel filtration and enzyme activity assays confirmed that the hexamer is the active form for nsp15 and demonstrate the specificity of nsp15 for uridylate.

METHODS 40 depressed patients 29.65 +/- 9.38 years old, and 120 normal controls 27.23 +/- 10.62 years old entered the study. In 20 of them (12 patients and 8 controls) the instrument was re-applied 1-2 days later. Translation and Back Translation was made. Clinical Diagnosis was reached by consensus of two examiners with the use of the SCAN v.2.0 and the IPDE. Statistical Analysis included ANOVA, the Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient, Principal Components Analysis and Discriminant Function Analysis and the calculation of Cronbach's alpha (alpha) RESULTS Both Sensitivity and specificity exceed 90.00 at 23/24, Chronbach's alpha for the total scale was equal to 0.95. Factor analysis revealed three factors (positive affect, irritability and interpersonal relationships, depressed affect and somatic complains). The test-retest reliability was satisfactory (Pearson's R between 0.45 and 0.95 for individual items and 0.71 for total score).

AIMS In this study we looked at the profile of blood group phenotype of a series of Tunisian patients with covid-19 admitted to Abderrahman Mami hospital in Ariana . METHODS Our study included 51 Tunisian patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to Abderrahmane Mami hospital between late march 2020 and early May 2020. The distribution of blood groups in Covid-19 patients was compared with that of a control group of 1506 patients with no Covid-19 infection as well as with the distribution of blood groups in a population of 63375 voluntary blood donors. RESULTS Our series, although limited in size, showed a higher prevalence of blood group A among Covid-19 patients, statistically significant compared to ABO blood group distribution among Tunisian blood donors and among a control group of patients without Covid -19. CONCLUSION these results are in line with data from the literature, particularly on larger series in China.","Yalaoui, Sadok; Fakhfakh, Radhouane; Tritar, Fatma; Chaouch, Nawel; Mestiri, Tahar; Besbes, Mohamed; Hamzaoui, Agnès",La Tunisie medicale,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33479990/,451

In 5 patients lymphoblastic and in one monoblastic acute leukemia were diagnosed. The course of leukemia passed without any particular complications. Attention is drawn to the presence in 5 patients of either a clone with high hyperdiploidy, or the presence of an increased number of polyploid cells. At the same time, pulverization and fragmentation of chromosomes often observed during radiation, viral exposure, cancer and precancerous hyperplasia, were found. It is suggested that the mitosis disorder we identified in several cases of COVID-19, accompanied by polyploidy, pulverization and fragmentation of chromosomes, can be regarded as a ""second hit "" during development of childhood acute leukemia, or as an accelerator of the manifestation of an already existing process.","Zedginidze, A; Shengelaia, A; Jashiashvili, S",Georgian medical news,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34511457/,451

We have validated the sensor by detecting herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), but the principle is generally applicable. Detection of HSV-1 virus particles was performed by applying the virus sample onto a sensor surface coated with a specific antibody against HSV-1. The performance of the sensor was tested by monitoring virus samples at clinically relevant concentrations. We show that the Young interferometer sensor can specifically and sensitively detect HSV-1 at very low concentrations (850 particles/mL). We have further demonstrated that the sensor can specifically detect HSV-1 suspended in serum. Extrapolation of the results indicates that the sensitivity of the sensor approaches the detection of a single virus particle binding, yielding a sensor of unprecedented sensitivity with wide applications for viral diagnostics.","Ymeti, Aurel; Greve, Jan; Lambeck, Paul V; Wink, Thijs; van Hövell, Stephan W F M; Beumer, Tom A M; Wijn, Robert R; Heideman, Rene G; Subramaniam, Vinod; Kanger, Johannes S",Nano letters,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17298006/,451
202117,Decrease in Strokes during SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic: Where Did All Our Stroke Patients Go?,2020,"The recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a potent pathogen of humans and is capable of rapid global spread. Peptide-conjugated antisense morpholino oligomers (P-PMO) were designed to bind by base pairing to specific sequences in the SARS-CoV (Tor2 strain) genome. The P-PMO were tested for their capacity to inhibit production of infectious virus as well as to probe the function of conserved viral RNA motifs and secondary structures. Several virus-targeted P-PMO and a random-sequence control P-PMO showed low inhibitory activity against SARS coronavirus. Certain other virus-targeted P-PMO reduced virus-induced cytopathology and cell-to-cell spread as a consequence of decreasing viral amplification. Active P-PMO were effective when administered at any time prior to peak viral synthesis and exerted sustained antiviral effects while present in culture medium. P-PMO showed low nonspecific inhibitory activity against translation of nontargeted RNA or growth of the arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Two P-PMO targeting the viral transcription-regulatory sequence (TRS) region in the 5' untranslated region were the most effective inhibitors tested. After several viral passages in the presence of a TRS-targeted P-PMO, partially drug-resistant SARS-CoV mutants arose which contained three contiguous base point mutations at the binding site of a TRS-targeted P-PMO. Those partially resistant viruses grew more slowly and formed smaller plaques than wild-type SARS-CoV. These results suggest PMO compounds have powerful therapeutic and investigative potential toward coronavirus infection.","Neuman, Benjamin W; Stein, David A; Kroeker, Andrew D; Churchill, Michael J; Kim, Alice M; Kuhn, Peter; Dawson, Philip; Moulton, Hong M; Bestwick, Richard K; Iversen, Patrick L; Buchmeier, Michael J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16014928/,451

OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of COVID-19-related state closures on consumer spending, business revenue, and employment, while controlling for changes in COVID-19 incidence and death. DESIGN: The analysis estimated a difference-in-difference model, utilizing temporal and geographic variation in state closure orders to analyze their impact on the economy, while controlling for COVID-19 incidence and death. PARTICIPANTS: State-level data on economic outcomes from the Opportunity Insights data tracker and COVID-19 cases and death data from usafacts.org. INTERVENTIONS: The mitigation strategy analyzed within this study was COVID-19-related state closure orders. Data on these orders were obtained from state government Web sites containing executive or administrative orders. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes include state-level estimates of consumer spending, business revenue, and employment levels. RESULTS: Analyses showed that although state closures led to a decrease in consumer spending, business revenue, and employment, they accounted for only a small portion of the observed decreases in these outcomes over the first wave of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of COVID-19 on economic activity likely reflects a combination of factors, in addition to state closures, such as individuals' perceptions of risk related to COVID-19 incidence, which may play significant roles in impacting economic activity.","Dunphy, Christopher; Miller, Gabrielle F; Rice, Ketra; Vo, Linda; Sunshine, Gregory; McCord, Russell; Howard-Williams, Mara; Coronado, Fátima",J. public health manag. pract.

We contend that national identification can mobilize and motivate people to engage in preventive behaviors to protect the collective, which in return would heighten national identification further. To test these reciprocal links, we conducted studies in two countries with diverse national tactics toward curbing the pandemic: (1) a two-wave longitudinal survey in China (Study 1, N = 1200), where a national goal to fight COVID-19 was clearly set, and (2) a five-wave longitudinal survey in the United States (Study 2, N = 1001), where the national leader, President Trump, rejected the severity of COVID-19 in its early stage. Results revealed that national identification was associated with an increase in disease-preventive behaviors in both countries in general. However, higher national identification was associated with greater trust in Trump's administration among politically conservative American participants, which then was associated with slower adoption of preventive behaviors. The reciprocal effect of disease-preventive behaviors on national identification was observed only in China. Overall, our findings suggest that although national identification may serve as a protective factor in curbing the pandemic, this beneficial effect was reduced in some political contexts.","Chan, Hoi-Wing; Wang, Xue; Zuo, Shi-Jiang; Chiu, Connie Pui-Yee; Liu, Li; Yiu, Daphne W; Hong, Ying-Yi",Political psychology,,451

However, the risk factors associated with the severity and mortality of COVID-19 are yet to be described in detail. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the information of 1525 cases from the Leishenshan Hospital in Wuhan. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were generated to explore the relationship between procalcitonin (PCT) level and the progression and prognosis of COVID-19. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to explore the relationship between disease severity in hospitalized patients and their PCT levels. Survival curves and the cumulative hazard function for COVID-19 progression were conducted in the two groups. To further detect the relationship between the computed tomography score and survival days, curve-fitting analyses were performed. Results: Patients in the elevated PCT group had a higher incidence of severe and critical severity conditions (P < 0.001), death, and higher computed tomography (CT) scores. There was an association between elevated PCT levels and mortality in the univariate ((hazard ratio [1], 3.377; 95% confidence interval [2], 1.012-10.344; P = 0.033) and multivariate Cox regression analysis (HR, 4.933; 95% CI, 1.170-20.788; P = 0.030). Similarly, patients with elevated PCT were more likely to have critically severe disease conditions in the univariate (odds ratio [2], 7.247; 95% CI, 3.559-14.757; P < 0.001) and multivariate logistic regression analysis (OR, 10.679; 95% CI, 4.562-25.000; P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier curves showed poorer prognosis for patients with elevated PCT (P = 0.024). The CT score 1 for patients with elevated PCT peaked at day 40 following the onset of symptoms then decreased gradually, while their total CT score was relatively stable. Conclusion: PCT level was shown as an independent risk factor of in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients. Compared with inpatients with normal PCT levels, inpatients with elevated PCT levels had a higher risk for overall mortality and critically severe disease. These findings may provide guidance for improving the prognosis of patients with critically severe COVID-19.","Liu, Ze-Ming; Li, Jin-Peng; Wang, Shi-Pei; Chen, Dan-Yang; Zeng, Wen; Chen, Si-Chao; Huang, Yi-Hui; Huang, Jiang-Long; Long, Wei; Li, Man; Gao, Rong-Fen; Guo, Liang; Wu, Xiao-Hui",Int J Med Sci,,451

205577,Low Neutralizing Antibody Responses Against SARS-CoV-2 in Elderly Myeloma Patients After the First BNT162b2 Vaccine Dose,2021,"Anosmia constitutes a prominent symptom of COVID-19. However, anosmia is also a common symptom of acute colds of various origins. In contrast to an acute cold, it appears from several questionnaire-based studies that in the context of COVID-19 infection, anosmia is the main rhinological symptom and is usually not associated with other rhinological symptoms such as rhinorrhoea or nasal obstruction. Until now, no study has directly compared smell and taste function between COVID-19 patients and patients with other causes of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) using valid and reliable psychophysical tests. In this study, we aimed to objectively assess and compare olfactory and gustatory functions in 10 COVID-19 patients (PCR diagnosed, assessed on average 2 weeks after infection), 10 acute cold (AC) patients (assessed before the COVID-19 outbreak) and 10 healthy controls, matched for age and sex. Smell performance was assessed using the extended ""Sniffin' Sticks"" test battery (4), while taste function was assessed using ""taste strips"" (5). Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were built to probe olfactory and gustatory scores in terms of their discrimination between COVID-19 and AC patients. Our results suggest that mechanisms of COVID-19 related olfactory dysfunction are different from those seen in an AC and may reflect, at least to some extent, a specific involvement at the level of central nervous system in some COVID-19 patients. In the future, studies to assess the prevalence of persistent anosmia and neuroanatomical changes on MRI correlated to chemosensory function, will be useful to understand these mechanisms.","Huart, C; Philpott, C; Konstantinidis, I; Altundag, A; Whitcroft, K L; Trecca, E M C; Cassano, M; Rombaux, Ph; Hummel, T",Rhinology (Leiden),,451

207206,Children with SARS-CoV-2 in the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C),2021,"BACKGROUND: Accurately predicting outcomes for cancer patients with COVID-19 has been clinically challenging. Numerous clinical variables have been retrospectively associated with disease severity, but the predictive value of these variables, and how multiple variables interact to increase risk, remains unclear. METHODS: We used machine learning algorithms to predict COVID-19 severity in 348 cancer patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. Using only clinical variables collected on or before a patient's COVID-19 positive date (time zero), we sought to classify patients into one of three possible future outcomes: Severe-early (the patient required high levels of oxygen support within 3 days of being tested positive for COVID-19), Severe-late (the patient required high levels of oxygen after 3 days), and Non-severe (the patient never required oxygen support). RESULTS: Our algorithm classified patients into these classes with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) ranging from 70 to 85%, significantly outperforming prior methods and univariate analyses. Critically, classification accuracy is highest when using a potpourri of clinical variables - including basic patient information, pre-existing diagnoses, laboratory and radiological work, and underlying cancer type - suggesting that COVID-19 in cancer patients comes with numerous, combinatorial risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we provide a computational tool that can identify high-risk patients early in their disease progression, which could aid in clinical decision-making and selecting treatment options.","Navlakha, Saket; Morjaria, Sejal; Perez-Johnston, Rocio; Zhang, Allen; Taur, Ying",BMC Infect Dis,,451

To combat it, it is necessary to develop a better understanding of how the virus infects host cells. Infection normally starts with the attachment of the virus to cell-surface glycans like heparan sulfate (HS) and sialic acid-containing glycolipids/glycoproteins. In this study, we examined and compared the binding of the subunits and spike (S) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV to these glycans. Our results revealed that the S proteins and subunits can bind to HS in a sulfation-dependent manner and no binding with sialic acid residues was detected. Overall, this work suggests that HS binding may be a general mechanism for the attachment of these coronaviruses to host cells, and supports the potential importance of HS in infection and in the development of antiviral agents against these viruses.","Hao, Wei; Ma, Bo; Li, Ziheng; Wang, Xiaoyu; Gao, Xiaopan; Li, Yaohao; Qin, Bo; Shang, Shiying; Cui, Sheng; Tan, Zhongping",,,451

First, we apply an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to a discrete-time stochastic augmented compartmental model to estimate the time-varying effective reproduction number (Rt). We use daily confirmed cases, active cases, recovered cases, deceased cases, Case-Fatality-Rate (CFR), and infectious time as inputs for the model. Furthermore, we define a Transmission Index (TI) as a ratio between the instantaneous and the maximum value of the effective reproduction number. The value of TI indicates the ""effectiveness"" of the disease transmission from a contact between a susceptible and an infectious individual in the presence of current measures, such as physical distancing and lock-down, relative to a normal condition. Based on the value of TI, we forecast different scenarios to see the effect of relaxing and tightening public measures.

A set of 14 Aloe vera compounds satisfying ‘Lipinsky’s rule of five’ was collected from the literature. The results suggested that compounds feralolide, aloe-emodin, eupatorin, aloesaponarinII, chrysophanol and aloesaponarinI can bind strongly to the active site of NSP-16, and can be promising natural candidates to inhibit NSP-16.","Divya, Shaji Abhinav Das",,,451
212968,Investigation of COVID-19 comorbidities reveals genes and pathways coincident with the SARS-CoV-2 viral disease,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly worldwide, seriously endangering human health. In addition to the typical symptoms of pulmonary infection, patients with COVID-19 have been reported to have gastrointestinal symptoms and/or intestinal flora dysbiosis. It is known that a healthy intestinal flora is closely related to the maintenance of pulmonary and systemic health by regulating the host immune homeostasis. Role of the “gut-lung axis” has also been well-articulated. This review provides a novel suggestion that intestinal flora may be one of the mediators of the gastrointestinal responses and abnormal immune responses in hosts caused by SARS-CoV-2; improving the composition of intestinal flora and the proportion of its metabolites through probiotics, and personalized diet could be a potential strategy to prevent and treat COVID-19. More clinical and evidence-based medical trials may be initiated to determine the strategy.","He, Li-Hong; Ren, Long-Fei; Li, Jun-Feng; Wu, Yong-Na; Li, Xun; Zhang, Lei",Front. Microbiol.,,451
213537,Oral favipiravir for patients with delayed SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA clearance: a case series,2020,"BACKGROUND: At the end of December 2019, a novel respiratory infection, initially reported in China, known as COVID-19 initially reported in China, and later known as COVID-19, led to a global pandemic. Despite many studies reporting respiratory infections as the primary manifestations of this illness, an increasing number of investigations have focused on the central nervous system (CNS) manifestations in COVID-19. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the CNS presentations in COVID-19 patients in an attempt to identify the common CNS features and provide a better overview to tackle this new pandemic. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, Ovid, EMBASE, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Included studies were publications that reported the CNS features between 1 January 2020 and 20 April 2020. The data of selected studies were screened and extracted independently by four reviewers. Extracted data analyzed by using STATA statistical software. The study protocol registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020184456). RESULTS: Of 2,353 retrieved studies, we selected 64 studies with 11,687 patients after screening. Most of the studies were conducted in China (58 studies). The most common CNS symptom of COVID-19 was headache (8.69%, 95%CI: 6.76%-10.82%), dizziness (5.94%, 95%CI: 3.66%-8.22%), and impaired consciousness (1.90%, 95%CI: 1.0%-2.79%). CONCLUSIONS: The growing number of studies has reported COVID-19, CNS presentations as remarkable manifestations that happen. Hence, understanding the CNS characteristics of COVID-19 can help us for better diagnosis and ultimately prevention of worse outcomes.","Nazari, Shahrzad; Azari Jafari, Amirhossein; Mirmoeeni, Seyyedmohammadsadeq; Sadeghian, Saeid; Heidari, Mohammad Eghbal; Sadeghian, Siavash; Assarzadegan, Farhad; Puormand, Seyed Mahmoud; Ebadi, Hamid; Fathi, Davood; Dalvand, Sahar",Brain Behav,,451

The kinetic description leads to study the evolution over time of Boltzmann type equations describing the number densities of social contacts of susceptible, infected and recovered individuals, whose proportions are driven by a classical compartmental model in epidemiology. Explicit calculations show that the spread of the disease is closely related to the mean number of contacts, thus justifying the lockdown strategies assumed by governments to prevent them. Furthermore, the kinetic model allows to clarify how a selective control can be assumed to achieve a minimal lockdown strategy by only reducing individuals undergoing a very large number of daily contacts. This, in turns, could permit to maintain at best the economic activities which would seriously suffer from a total closure policy. Numerical simulations confirm the ability of the model to describe different phenomena characteristic of the rapid spread of an epidemic. A last part is dedicated to fit numerical solutions of the proposed model with experimental data coming from different European countries.","Dimarco, G.; Perthame, B.; Toscani, G.; Zanella, M.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.01140v1.pdf,451

215238,Vaccine Hesitancy in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis: Preparing for the SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination Challenge,2021,"Due to the contagious nature of the COVID-19 virus, healthcare workers are at a great risk of infection. Since medical imaging plays a significant part in the healthcare system and is often used in the diagnosis of potential COVID-19 patients, the radiology personnel are at a very high risk of becoming infected. PURPOSE: This study aims to assess the enforcement of infection control guidelines for patients with COVID-19 during medical imaging procedures and raise awareness of infection control in different hospitals in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A total of 128 responses were collected from four hospitals across Saudi Arabia using a new structured questionnaire, which was created for health workers by the WHO specifically for this purpose. Data were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020. RESULTS: Most participants correctly followed the guidelines of the WHO and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on infection control in the X-ray and general radiology departments. Guideline awareness was higher among magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerised tomography (CT) radiographers, which reduced the risk of future infections. Out of the total respondents, 98.4% stated that they had received formal training in hand hygiene. Only 40.6% of participants, however, knew that respiratory droplets are the primary mode of transmission of the virus from person to person. CONCLUSION: The knowledge of healthcare professionals in the radiology department regarding infection control needs to be continually assessed. A focus on educational interventions on infection control is required in order to maintain well-informed medical staff.","Almatari, M; Alghamdi, Ali; Alamri, Sultan; Otaibey, Mufeed; Alghamdi, Ahmad Joman; Alasmari, Azah; Alelyani, Magbool",,,451

However, it is not clear whether individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) are at a higher risk of COVID-19 or its adverse consequences. Recurrent respiratory viral infections are often associated with perturbation and pulmonary exacerbations of CF as evidenced by the significant morbidity observed in CF individuals during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. The primary goal of this review was to systematically survey published accounts of COVID-19 in CF and determine if individuals with CF are disproportionally affected by SARS-CoV-2 and development of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search using EMBASE and Medline between April 28 and December 10, 2020. Six evaluable studies reporting on a total of 339 individuals with CF who developed COVID-19 were included in this study. RESULTS: We found that although individuals with CF generally experience acute exacerbations of lung disease from infectious agents, COVID-19 incidence estimates in CF appear to be lower than in the general population. However, there are reports of subsets of CF, such as those who had organ transplants, that may experience a more severe COVID-19 course. Potential protective mechanisms in the CF population include pre-pandemic social isolation practices, infection prevention and control knowledge, altered expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme, and the use of certain medications. CONCLUSIONS: Although individuals with CF are at risk of acute exacerbations often precipitated by respiratory tract viral infections, published evidence to date indicated that individuals with CF do not experience higher risks of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, there is evidence that some subsets within the CF population, including those post-transplantation, may experience a more severe clinical course. As SARS-CoV-2 variants are identified and the pandemic goes through additional waves of disease outbreaks, ongoing monitoring of the risk of COVID-19 in individuals with CF is required.","Mathew, Hannah R; Choi, May Y; Parkins, Michael D; Fritzler, Marvin J",BMC Pulm Med,,451

METHODOLOGY: The nonlinear feature of updated cases is captured through Generalized Additive Mixed Model (GAMM) with threshold points; Exposure-response curve suggests that daily confirmed cases is changed at the different stages of TD according to the threshold points of piecewise function, which traces out the rule of updated cases under different meteorological condition. RESULTS: Our results show that the confirmed cases decreased by 0.390% (95% CI: -0.478 ~ -0.302) for increasing each one degree of TD if TD is less than 11.5°C; It will increase by 0.302% (95% CI: 0.215 ~ 0.388) for every 1°C increase in the TD (lag0-4) at the interval [11.5, 16]; Meanwhile the number of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases will increase by 0.321% (95% CI: 0.142 ~ 0.499) for every 1°C increase in the TD (lag0-4) when the TD (lag0-4) is over 16°C, and the most fluctuation occurred on Sunday. The results of the sensitivity analysis confirmed our model robust. CONCLUSIONS: In US, this interval effect of TD reminds us that it is urgent to control the spread and infection of COVID-19 when TD becomes greater in autumn and the ongoing winter.","Ding, Yongmei; Gao, Liyuan; Shao, Ning-Yi",J Infect Dev Ctries,,451

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study involving all patients who presented with clinical features of SARI and who had undergone bedside chest X-ray (CXR), hemograms with TLC, NLR, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at our institute from May 1 to June 30, 2020. RESULTS: Of 204 patients, 115 tested RT-PCR-positive and 89 tested negative. The patients who presented with SARI, using CXR-based score of 4 or more, TLC of less than 8,700 cells/µL, and NLR of <7 had a statistically significant area under the curve (p<0.001) for diagnosing COVID-19. The sensitivity and specificity of the CXR score was 80.8% and 73.0%, of TLC was 70.1% and 74.7%, and of NLR was 70.1% and 59.0%, respectively, in diagnosing COVID-19 alone. The specificity further increased to 90.4% when we used the CXR score with NLR and to 92.8% when we used the CXR score with TLC. The post-test odds (""rule in"" disease) of a positive test for having the disease were 3, 2.77, and 1.71 times with the use of either CXR score, TLC, or NLR criteria, respectively; whereas, combined use of CXR score and NLR increased the post-test odds by 5.53 times, and combination of CXR score with TLC increased the post-test odds by 7.5 times. CONCLUSION: CXR score with TLC and NLR can predict COVID-19 infection among those who presented with features of SARI.

The COVID-19 pandemic also has affected the mental health of the community. Aims: The purpose of this study is to investigate the individuals' perceptions of subjective well-being (SWB) and resilience (R) during the pandemic. Method: A total of 643 people, 351 women and 292 men, who are not diagnosed with COVID-19, have voluntarily participated in the study. The data were collected online due to social restrictions. Also, their pre-pandemic SWB and R levels were evaluated based on their statements taken during the pandemic since the pandemic was not foreseen at this time. Results: A significant decrease was observed in participants' SWB and R levels during the pandemic. Besides, significant differences were observed in R levels according to gender and age;on the other hand, no difference was observed according to the participants' residence type, city type, education level, and job status. Regarding SWB level, significant differences were observed according to gender, age, and job status;no difference was observed according to residence type, city type, and education level. Limitations: Participants' subjective well-being and resilience data could not be collected before the pandemic due to the unpredictable and fast spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. When individuals compare the current pandemic period with their past (before the pandemic), they may perceive their resilience and subjective well-being levels as decreased.

Researchers have frequently used exact coordinates provided in a small percentage of tweets, but Twitter removed the option to share these coordinates in mid-2019. Moreover, there is reason to suspect that a large share of the provided coordinates did not correspond to GPS coordinates of the user even before that.

The analyses aimed at the selection of appropriate measures and solutions to improve safety of cyclists in the road traffic have been presented. The procedures include: Selection of devices and measures, risk assessment and estimation of the potential to reduce the risk of collisions/accidents involving cyclists, selection of investment measures and devices reducing the risk of cyclists and other road users, implementation methods and monitoring of selected measures reducing the risk of collisions/accidents involving cyclists. The proposals contained in the article fill in the gap existing in this area of knowledge. The analyses conducted and the presented results show that the construction of infrastructure for cyclists is not the only way to improve the safety of this group of road users. Due to the high costs and deficit of the road surface in the road-street cross-section—other forms of measures in this area should also be analyzed.","Skoczyński, Przemysław",Applied Sciences,,451

Recently, the deep learning model, such as U-Net outperforms other network architectures for biomedical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel model, namely, Recurrent Residual 3D U-Net (R2U3D), for the 3D lung segmentation task. In particular, the proposed model integrates 3D convolution into the Recurrent Residual Neural Network based on U-Net. It helps learn spatial dependencies in 3D and increases the propagation of 3D volumetric information. The proposed R2U3D network is trained on the publicly available dataset LUNA16 and it achieves state-of-the-art performance on both LUNA16 (testing set) and VESSEL12 dataset. In addition, we show that training the R2U3D model with a smaller number of CT scans, i.e., 100 scans, without applying data augmentation achieves an outstanding result in terms of Soft Dice Similarity Coefficient (Soft-DSC) of 0.9920.","Kadia, Dhaval D.; Alom, Md Zahangir; Burada, Ranga; Nguyen, Tam V.; Asari, Vijayan K.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.02290v1.pdf,451
225024,Mitochondrial induced T cell apoptosis and aberrant myeloid metabolic programs define distinct immune cell subsets during acute and recovered SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020,"COVID-19 pneumonia is a disease that causes an existential health crisis in many people by directly affecting and damaging lung cells. The segmentation of infected areas from computed tomography (CT) images can be used to assist and provide useful information for COVID-19 diagnosis. Although several deep learning-based segmentation methods have been proposed for COVID-19 segmentation and have achieved state-of-the-art results, the segmentation accuracy is still not high enough (approximately 85%) due to the variations COVID-19 infected areas (such as shape and size variations) and the similarities between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 infected areas. To improve the segmentation accuracy of COVID-19 infected areas, we propose an interactive attention refinement network (Attention RefNet). This network is integrated with a backbone segmentation network to refine the initial segmentation resulting from the backbone segmentation network. There are three contributions of this paper, as follows. First, we propose an interactive attention refinement network, which can be connected with any segmentation network and trained with the segmentation network in an end-to-end fashion. Second, we propose a skip connection attention module to improve the important features in both segmentation and refinement networks for initial segmentation and refinement. Ultimately, we propose a seed point module to enhance the important seeds (positions) for interactive refinement. The effectiveness of the proposed method was demonstrated on public datasets (COVID-19CTSeg and MICCAI) and our private multicenter dataset. The segmentation accuracy was improved to more than 90%. We also confirmed the generalizability of the proposed network on our multicenter dataset. The proposed method can still achieve high segmentation accuracy. The model can even be applied to datasets from other centers that are collected in different hospitals and were not included in the training dataset.","Kitrungrotsakul, T.; Chen, Q.; Wu, H.; Iwamoto, Y.; Hu, H.; Zhu, W.; Chen, C.; Xu, F.; Zhou, Y.; Lin, L.; Tong, R.

225924,SARS-CoV-2: What do we know so far?,2020,"Introduction: Conventional oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is relatively easy to diagnose on histopathology, as it comprises dysplastic epithelial cells with variable degrees of squamous differentiation. Different grading systems have been employed in grading OSCC based on its dysplastic features and host response. Some unusual features such as clear cell change, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), stromal hyalinization, stromal desmoplasia, perineural invasion, vascular invasion, tissue eosinophilia, giant cells, and tertiary lymphoid follicle formation are evident in OSCC histologically but have not yet been accounted in any grading systems of OSCC except perineural and vascular invasion. Aim: The aim of the present study was to identify these uncommon features and to correlate them with different grades of OSCC.Materials and Methods:This study was conducted on 100 histopathologically confirmed OSCC cases retrieved from the archives of our department. They were graded on the basis of Broder's grading system and were reviewed for the features mentioned above. Data collected were subjected to statistical analysis. Results: Clear cell change, EMT, foreign body giant cells, and tumor giant cells were observed in 13%, 20%, 1%, and 3% of cases, respectively. We found stromal desmoplasia in 15% and stromal hyalinization in 9% of cases. Tissue eosinophilia, tertiary lymphoid follicle formation, and perineural invasion were observed in 12%, 3%, and 2% of cases, respectively. Vascular invasion was not evident in any of the cases examined. Conclusion: The incidence of the unusual features was 7.8% in our study.","Gupta, Shruti; Kamboj, Mala; Narwal, Anjali",J Cancer Res Ther,,451

While prone positioning (PP) is an established therapy in mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), its role in conscious patients is less well defined. We retrospectively reviewed our experience of implementing early PP in a cohort of 24 patients with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 who required support with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The use of PP alongside CPAP significantly increased both the ROX index and arterial oxygen pressure:fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2:FiO2) ratio from baseline values (ROX index: 7.0±2.5 baseline vs 11.4±3.7 CPAP+PP, p<0.0001; PaO2:FiO2 ratio: 143±73 mm Hg baseline vs 252±87 mm Hg CPAP+PP, p<0.01), and the changes to both the ROX index and PaO2:FiO2 ratio remained significant 1 hour after cessation of proning. The mean duration of PP in the first 24 hours was 8±5 hours. Few complications were observed and PP was continued for a mean of 10±5 days. From our experience in a dedicated COVID-19 respiratory high care unit, PP alongside CPAP therapy was feasible, tolerated, safe and improved oxygenation. The use of conscious PP in ARDS warrants further investigation in randomised controlled trials.","Winearls, Stuart; Swingwood, Ema L; Hardaker, Charlotte L; Smith, Amy M; Easton, Fraser M; Millington, Katherine J; Hall, Rebecca S; Smith, Ann; Curtis, Katrina J",,,451

To date, empirical evidence on the effects of COVID-19 on TB outcomes has been limited. Here we summarise the evidence available at a country level, identifying broad mechanisms by which COVID-19 may modify TB burden and mitigation efforts. From the data, it is clear that there have been substantial disruptions to TB health services and an increase in vulnerability to TB. Evidence for changes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission is limited, and it remains unclear how the resources required and available for the TB response have changed. To advocate for additional funding to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the global TB burden, and to efficiently allocate resources for the TB response, requires a significant improvement in the TB data available.","McQuaid, C F; Vassall, A; Cohen, T; Fiekert, K; White, R G",Int J Tuberc Lung Dis,,451

Initially, a mediation model verified a partially mediated population role in the relationship between landscape pattern and infection number. Adjusted incidence rate (AIR) and community safety index (CSI), two indicators for infection risk in sub-districts, were 25.82â¼63.56 &#8241; and 3.00â¼15.87 respectively, and central urban sub-districts were at higher infection risk. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) performed better than OLS regression with AICc differences of 7.951â¼181.261. The adjusted R2 in GWR models of class-level index and infection risk were 0.697 to 0.817, while for the landscape-level index they were 0.668 to 0.835. Secondly, 16 key landscape metrics were identified based on GWR, and then a prediction model for infection risk in sub-districts and communities was developed. Using principal component analysis (PCA), development intensity, landscape level, and urban blue-green space were considered to be principal components affecting disease infection risk, explaining 73.1% of the total variance. Cropland (PLAND and LSI), urban land (NP, LPI, and LSI) and unused land (NP) represent development intensity, greatly affecting infection risk in urban areas. Landscape level CONTAG, DIVISION, SHDI, and SHEI represent mobility and connectivity, having a profound impact on infection risk in both urban and suburban areas. Water (PLAND, NP, LPI, and LSI) and woodland (NP, and LSI) represent urban blue-green spaces, and were particularly important for infection risk in suburban areas. Based on urban landscape pattern, we proposed a framework to understand and evaluate infection risk. These findings provide a basis for risk evaluation and policy-making of urban infectious disease, which is significant for community management and urban planning for infectious disease worldwide.","Ye, Yang; Qiu, Hongfei",Urban For Urban Green,,451

Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections are associated with high rates of morbidity, mortality, and an important burden on healthcare systems worldwide, especially in elderly patients. The aim of this study was to identify severity predictors in the oldest-old admitted with influenza and/or RSV infections. This is a multicenter, retrospective study of all oldest-old patients (&#8805; 85 years old) admitted for laboratory-confirmed influenza and/or RSV infection in three tertiary hospitals in Portugal, Italy, and Cyprus over two consecutive winter seasons. The outcomes included the following: pneumonia on infection presentation, use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV), and in-hospital death (IHD). The association with possible predictors, including clinical features and type of virus infection, was assessed using uni- and multivariable analyses. A total of 251 oldest-old patients were included in the study. Pneumonia was evident in 32.3% (n = 81). NIV was implemented in 8.8% (n = 22), and IHD occurred in 13.9% (n = 35). Multivariable analyses revealed that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma was associated with pneumonia (OR 1.86; 95% CI 1.02-3.43; p = 0.045). COPD or asthma (OR 4.4; 95% CI 1.67-11.6; p = 0.003), RSV (OR 3.12; 95% CI 1.09-8.92; p = 0.023), and influenza B infections (OR 3.77; 95% CI 1.06-13.5; p = 0.041) were associated with NIV use, respectively, while chronic kidney disease was associated with IHD (OR 2.50; 95% CI 1.14-5.51; p = 0.023). Among the oldest-old, chronic organ failure, such as COPD or asthma, and CKD predicted pneumonia and IHD, respectively, beyond the importance of viral virulence itself. These findings could impact on public health policies, such as fostering influenza immunization campaigns, home-based care programs, and end-of-life care.

The current research aims at the improvements of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) during the COVID-19 lockdown in India. This research has been done using both the open source data sets taken from satellite and ground based for better analysis. For the satellite-based analysis, the Sentinel 5 Precauser's Tropospheric NO2 from the European Space Agency and for the ground-based numeric data sets from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has been used. During the COVID-19 disease, outbreak the world has set in quarantine and as an overcome air quality improved in Asian countries after national lockdown, the average NO2 rates plummeted calculated by 40-50%. Similarly, it dramatically decreased in Asia during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine period. The basic statistical patterns of the NO2 concentration spectrum of historical data sets (2018-2020) bi-weekly showed during October to March were seen higher in each year. Related with National Ambient Air Quality Standards of mean of NO2 in India our result shown in the NO2 levels fall in 21 µg/m3 during the national lockdown, from the Central Pollution Control Board's air quality standards it almost decreased 50% of the hourly mean in India. This caused by the sudden restriction to the development of manufacturing and the transportations which ultimately minimized the fossil fuel burning which cause the most of the NO2 releases to the atmosphere.

The diagnosis of COVID-19 depends on a positive nucleic acid amplification test by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, the clinical manifestations and imaging features of COVID-19 are non-specific, and nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2 can have false-negative results. It is presently believed that detection of specific antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is an effective screening and diagnostic indicator for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, a combination of nucleic acid and specific antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 will be more effective to diagnose COVID-19, especially to exclude suspected cases.","Zhao, Kaochang; Ai, Li; Zhao, Yang; Wang, Tao; Zheng, Zhishui; Zeng, Shaolin; Ding, Xuhong; Hu, Suping; Nie, Hanxiang",Epidemiol Infect,,451

239164,Comparative analysis of post-vaccination anti-spike IgG antibodies in old Nursing Home Residents and in middle-aged Healthcare workers,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has created a public health crisis. Because SARS-CoV-2 can spread from individuals with pre-symptomatic, symptomatic, and asymptomatic infections, the re-opening of societies and the control of virus spread will be facilitated by robust population screening, for which virus testing will often be central. After infection, individuals undergo a period of incubation during which viral titers are usually too low to detect, followed by an exponential viral growth, leading to a peak viral load and infectiousness, and ending with declining viral levels and clearance. Given the pattern of viral load kinetics, we model the effectiveness of repeated population screening considering test sensitivities, frequency, and sample-to-answer reporting time. These results demonstrate that effective screening depends largely on frequency of testing and the speed of reporting, and is only marginally improved by high test sensitivity. We therefore conclude that screening should prioritize accessibility, frequency, and sample-to-answer time; analytical limits of detection should be secondary.","Larremore, Daniel B; Wilder, Bryan; Lester, Evan; Shehata, Soraya; Burke, James M; Hay, James A; Tambe, Milind; Mina, Michael J; Parker, Roy",Sci.

COVID-19 has been associated with a number of cardiovascular complications, including arrhythmias. The aim of the current study was to evaluate P-wave dispersion (PWD) as a predictor of atrial fibrillation in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19. In addition, the relationship between the PWD and inflammation parameters was investigated. METHODS: A total of 140 newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients and 140 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals were included in the study. The risk of atrial fibrillation was evaluated by calculating the electrocardiographic PWD. C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell, neutrophil and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were measured in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19. RESULTS: PWD, white blood cell, NLR and CRP levels were significantly higher in the COVID-19 group than the control group. There was a significant positive correlation between PWD and CRP level (rsâ=â0.510, Pâ<â0.001) and NLR in COVID-19 group (rsâ=â0.302, Pâ=â0.001). In their follow-up, 13 (9.3%) patients, 11 of whom were in the ICU, developed new atrial fibrillation. CONCLUSION: Our study showed for the first time in literature that the PWD, evaluated electrocardiographically in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19, was prolonged compared with normal healthy individuals. A positive correlation was found between PWD, CRP level and NLR. We believe that pretreatment evaluation of PWD in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19 would be beneficial for predicting atrial fibrillation risk.","Yenerçag, Mustafa; Arslan, Ugur; Seker, Onur O; Dereli, Seçkin; Kaya, Ahmet; Dogdus, Mustafa; Öztürk, Çagatay E; Akpinar, Çetin K; Sen, Ahmet",J Cardiovasc Med (Hagerstown),,451

We first identified ivermectin in a high throughput compound library screen as an agent potently able to inhibit recognition of the nuclear localizing Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) integrase protein by the host importin (IMP) &#945;/ß1 heterodimer, and recently demonstrated its ability to bind directly to IMP&#945; to cause conformational changes that prevent its function in nuclear import of key viral as well as host proteins. Cell culture experiments have shown robust antiviral action towards a whole range of viruses, including HIV-1, dengue, Zika and West Nile Virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Chikungunya, pseudorabies virus, adenovirus, and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Close to 70 clinical trials are currently in progress worldwide for SARS-CoV-2. Although few of these studies have been completed, the results that are available, as well as those from observational/retrospective studies, indicate clinical benefit.

In Saudi Arabia, the first case of COVID-19 was reported in March 2, 2020. In March 8, 2020, the Saudi authorities adopted the lockdown strategy to contain the disease. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of the various phases of the lockdown strategy in Saudi Arabia and its impact on the basic reproductive number (R0) of the COVID-19 outbreak. Material and Methods: The timeline of the COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia was divided into three-time intervals. Google Mobility Community Reports (2020) was used to estimate the changes in community mobility during the various phases of the lockdown. The basic reproductive number (R0) of the COVID-19 outbreak was calculated daily using the Susceptible, Infected and Recovered (SIR) model based on the Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) daily reports. This is a standard system to determine the spread of the virus on the basis of infection rate, quarantine rate as well as confirmation rate. The mean values of the calculated R0 during each interval were compared using one-way ANOVA test. Results: There was no statistically significant difference between the mean values of the different phases of the lockdown (P < 0.05). Moreover, mean R0 value of the second interval was 0.09 higher than the initial interval with free community mobility. Furthermore, the mean R0 values of the third interval with the full lockdown was 0.28 higher than the initial interval. Conclusion: Early implementation of lockdown strategy combined with other social distancing strategies help in containing infectious outbreaks in their early phases. Continuous assessment of such strategies' effectiveness provides decision makers with precious information needed to justify their application when considering their economic impact.","Ahmad Alajlan, Saleh; Alhusseini, Noara K; Mohammed Basheeruddin Asdaq, Syed; Mohzari, Yahya; Alamer, Ahmad; Alrashed, Ahmed A; Alamri, Abdulhakeem S; Alsanie, Walaa F; Alhomrani, Majid",,,451

The proposed model consists of three stages which include the preprocessing stage, the features selection stage, and the classification stage. This work uses a data set consists of 8571 records, with forty features for patients from different countries. Two feature selection techniques are used in order to select the best features that affect the prediction of the proposed model. These are the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) as wrapper feature selection and the Extra Tree Classifier (ETC) as embedded feature selection. Two classification methods are applied for classifying the features vectors which include the Naïve Bayesian method and Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) method.

BACKGROUND: Headache is one of the most frequent neurologic symptoms of Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Diagnosis of secondary headache disorders is still based on the presence of red flags. DESIGN AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study of hospitalized patients with confirmed Covid-19 disease. We interrogated every patient about the presence of headache and if so, a headache expert conducted a structured interview assessing the presence and type of the main red flags. We evaluated the presence of laboratory abnormalities on admission. RESULTS: We screened 576 consecutive patients, 130/576 (22.6%) described headache, and 104 were included in the study. Mean age of patients was 56.7 (standard deviation: 11.2) and 66/104 (63.4%) were female. Red flags concerning prior medical history were present in 79/104 (76.0%) cases, and those related to the headache itself were observed in 99/104 (95.2%) patients. All patients 104/104 (100%) described systemic symptoms and 86/104 (82.7%) some neurologic symptoms. Laboratory results were abnormal in 98/104 (94.2%) cases. The most frequent red flags were fever, in 93/104 (89.4%) patients, cough, in 89/104 (85.6% cases), and increased C-reactive protein in 84/100 (84.0%) cases. CONCLUSION: In patients with Covid-19 that described the headache red flags were present in most cases. There was not any universal red flag, being necessary the comprehensive evaluation of all of them.","García-Azorín, David; Trigo, Javier; Talavera, Blanca; Martínez-Pías, Enrique; Sierra, Álvaro; Porta-Etessam, Jesús; Arenillas, Juan F; Guerrero, Ángel L",Headache,,451
249022,Safety and efficacy of Favipiravir in moderate to severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia,2021,"Time series is a special type of sequence data, a set of observations collected at even intervals of time and ordered chronologically. Existing deep learning techniques use generic sequence models (e.g., recurrent neural network, Transformer model, or temporal convolutional network) for time series analysis, which ignore some of its unique properties. For example, the downsampling of time series data often preserves most of the information in the data, while this is not true for general sequence data such as text sequence and DNA sequence. Motivated by the above, in this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture and apply it for the time series forecasting problem, wherein we conduct sample convolution and interaction at multiple resolutions for temporal modeling. The proposed architecture, namelySCINet, facilitates extracting features with enhanced predictability. Experimental results show that SCINet achieves significant prediction accuracy improvement over existing solutions across various real-world time series forecasting datasets. In particular, it can achieve high fore-casting accuracy for those temporal-spatial datasets without using sophisticated spatial modeling techniques. Our codes and data are presented in the supplemental material.","Liu, Minhao; Zeng, Ailing; Lai, Qiuxia; Xu, Qiang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09305v1.pdf,451

We investigated the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies including immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies and the dynamic changes in antibody levels in convalescent COVID-19 patients. A total of 159 blood samples were collected from 52 recovered COVID-19 patients up to six months after symptom onset for longitudinal serological tests. The positive rate of IgG and IgM antibodies was 92.3% and 90.4% in the first month after symptom onset, and the seropositivity of IgG antibody remained high at all follow-up time points, whereas the seropositivity of IgM antibody decreased to 22.73% by the sixth months after symptom onset. The level of IgG antibody was stable, the level of IgM antibody decreased slightly in the early convalescent phase and was detected in only five patients in the sixth month after symptom onset. The level of IgG antibody was higher in the severe and critical group than in the moderate group. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies have a long-term persistence in convalescent COVID-19 patients, whether they have long-term protection need to be further investigated.","Liu, Chuanmiao; Yu, Xiaoqi; Gao, Chunming; Zhang, Li; Zhai, Hui; Hu, Yanan; Liu, Enhui; Wang, Qiong; Gao, Yu; Wei, Dong; Zhang, Donghua; Han, Yue; Zhang, Xinxin",J. med. virol,,451

Long-read sequencing devices from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) promise significant improvements in turnaround time, portability and cost, compared to established short-read sequencing platforms for viral WGS (e.g., Illumina). However, adoption of ONT sequencing for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance has been limited due to common concerns around sequencing accuracy. To address this, here we perform viral WGS with ONT and Illumina platforms on 157 matched SARS-CoV-2-positive patient specimens and synthetic RNA controls, enabling rigorous evaluation of analytical performance. We report that, despite the elevated error rates observed in ONT sequencing reads, highly accurate consensus-level sequence determination was achieved, with single nucleotide variants (SNVs) detected at >99% sensitivity and >99% precision above a minimum ~60-fold coverage depth, thereby ensuring suitability for SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis. ONT sequencing also identified a surprising diversity of structural variation within SARS-CoV-2 specimens that were supported by evidence from short-read sequencing on matched samples. However, ONT sequencing failed to accurately detect short indels and variants at low read-count frequencies.

Several alternatives in treatment options have been assessed and used in this patient population. However, when mechanical ventilation and prone positioning are unsuccessful, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [VV-ECMO] may be used. We present a case of a 62-year-old female, diabetic, admitted to the intensive care unit with fever, flu-like symptoms and a positive COVID-19 test. Ultimately, she worsened on mechanical ventilation and prone positioning and required VV-ECMO. The use of VV-ECMO in COVID-19 infected patients is still controversial. While some studies have shown a high mortality rate despite aggressive treatment, such as in our case, the lack of large sample size studies and treatment alternatives places healthcare providers against a wall without options in patients with severe refractory ARDS due to COVID-19.","Mounir, Anass; Lamghari, Saara; Raja, Amine; Allali, Khalil; Chebbar, Sara; Buri, Basma; Mahdar, Yasmine; Kettani, Chafik El; Ramdani, Benyounes; Ettaoumi, Youssef; Benouna, Ghali; Barrou, Lahoucine",Pan Afr Med J,,451
250830,Monitoring antibody response following SARS-CoV-2 infection: Diagnostic efficiency of four automated immunoassays,2020,"BACKGROUND: Different levels of control measures were introduced to contain the global COVID-19 pandemic, many of which have been controversial, particularly the comprehensive use of diagnostic tests. Regular testing of high-risk individuals (pre-existing conditions, older than 60 years of age) has been suggested by public health authorities. The WHO suggested the use of routine screening of residents, employees, and visitors of long-term care facilities (LTCF) to protect the resident risk group. Similar suggestions have been made by the WHO for other closed facilities including incarceration facilities (e.g., prisons or jails), wherein parts of the U.S., accelerated release of approved inmates is taken as a measure to mitigate COVID-19. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Here, the simulation model underlying the pandemic preparedness tool CovidSim 1.1 (http://covidsim.eu/) is extended to investigate the effect of regularly testing of employees to protect immobile resident risk groups in closed facilities. The reduction in the number of infections and deaths within the risk group is investigated. Our simulations are adjusted to reflect the situation of LTCFs in Germany, and incarceration facilities in the U.S. COVID-19 spreads in closed facilities due to contact with infected employees even under strict confinement of visitors in a pandemic scenario without targeted protective measures. Testing is only effective in conjunction with targeted contact reduction between the closed facility and the outside world-and will be most inefficient under strategies aiming for herd immunity. The frequency of testing, the quality of tests, and the waiting time for obtaining test results have noticeable effects. The exact reduction in the number of cases depends on disease prevalence in the population and the levels of contact reductions. Testing every 5 days with a good quality test and a processing time of 24 hours can lead up to a 40% reduction in the number of infections. However, the effects of testing vary substantially among types of closed facilities and can even be counterproductive in U.S. IFs. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of COVID-19 in closed facilities is unavoidable without a thorough screening of persons that can introduce the disease into the facility. Regular testing of employees in closed facilities can contribute to reducing the number of infections there, but is only meaningful as an accompanying measure, whose economic benefit needs to be assessed carefully.","Tsoungui Obama, Henri Christian Junior; Adil Mahmoud Yousif, Nessma; Alawam Nemer, Looli; Ngougoue Ngougoue, Pierre Marie; Ngwa, Gideon Akumah; Teboh-Ewungkem, Miranda; Schneider, Kristan Alexander",PLoS One,,451

The aim of this study is to assess the impact of different pathogen reduction methods on the levels and virus neutralizing activity of the specific antibodies against SARS-CoV2 in convalescent plasma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 140 plasma doses collected by plasmapheresis from COVID-19 convalescent donors were subjected to pathogen reduction by three methods: methylene blue (M)/visible light, riboflavin (R)/UVB and amotosalen (A)/UVA. To conduct a paired comparison, individual plasma doses were divided into 2 samples that were subjected to one of these methods. The titres of SARS-CoV2 neutralizing antibodies (NtAbs) and levels of specific immunoglobulins to RBD, S- and N-proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were measured before and after pathogen reduction. RESULTS: The methods reduced NtAbs titres differently: among units with the initial titre 80 or above, 81% of units remained unchanged and 19% decreased by one step after methylene blue; 60% were unchanged and 40% decreased by one step after amotosalen; after riboflavin 43% were unchanged and 50% (7%, respectively) had a one-step (two-step, respectively) decrease. Paired two-sample comparisons (M vs. A, M vs. R and A vs. R) revealed that the largest statistically significant decrease in quantity and activity of the specific antibodies resulted from the riboflavin treatment. CONCLUSION: Pathogen reduction with methylene blue or with amotosalen provides the greater likelihood of preserving the immunological properties of the COVID-19 convalescent plasma compared to riboflavin.","Kostin, Alexander I; Lundgren, Maria N; Bulanov, Andrey Y; Ladygina, Elena A; Chirkova, Karina S; Gintsburg, Alexander L; Logunov, Denis Y; Dolzhikova, Inna V; Shcheblyakov, Dmitry V; Borovkova, Natalia V; Godkov, Mikhail A; Bazhenov, Alexey I; Shustov, Valeriy V; Bogdanova, Alina S; Kamalova, Alina R; Ganchin, Vladimir V; Dombrovskiy, Eugene A; Volkov, Stanislav E; Drozdova, Nataliya E; Petrikov, Sergey S",Vox sang,,451

As of 24 May 2020, the confirmed cases of COVID-19 infections reached 4469, with 160 deaths and 2738 patients were recovered from the infection. Significant public health strategies have been implemented by the authorities to contain the outbreak nationwide. Nevertheless however, the number of cases is still rising dramatically. Here, we aim to describe a comprehensive and epidemiological study of all cases diagnosed in Iraq by 24 May 2020. Most of the cases were recorded in Baghdad followed by Basra and Najaf. About 45% of the patients were female (with 31% deaths of the total cases) and 55% were male (with 68% deaths of the total cases). Most cases are between the ages of (20-59) years old, and (30-39) years are the most affected range (19%). Approximately (8%) of cases are children under 10 years old. Iraq has shown a cure rate lower than those reported by Iran, Turkey and Jordan;and higher than Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Healthcare workers represented about (5%) of the total confirmed cases. These findings enable us to understand COVID-19 epidemiology and prevalence in Iraq that can alert our community to the risk of this novel coronavirus and serve as a baseline for future studies.","Sarhan, A.

256804,Impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the first Spanish national domiciliary enzymatic infusion strategy for lysosomal diseases,2021,"As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is still ongoing and dramatically influences our life, the need for recombinant viral proteins for diagnostics, vaccine development, and research is very high. The spike (S) protein, and particularly its receptor-binding domain (RBD), mediates the interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on host cells and may be modulated by its structural features. Therefore, well-characterized recombinant RBDs are essential. We have performed an in-depth structural and functional characterization of RBDs expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. To structurally characterize the native RBDs (comprising N- and O-glycans and additional post translational modifications), a multilevel mass spectrometric approach was employed. Released glycan and glycopeptide analysis were integrated with intact mass analysis, glycan-enzymatic dissection, and top-down sequencing for comprehensive annotation of RBD proteoforms. The data showed distinct glycosylation for CHO- and HEK293-RBD with the latter exhibiting antenna fucosylation, a higher level of sialylation, and a combination of core 1 and core 2 type O-glycans. Additionally, using an alternative approach based on N-terminal cleavage of the O-glycosylation, the previously unknown O-glycosylation site was localized at T323. For both RBDs, the binding to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies of positive patients and affinity to the ACE2 receptor was addressed showing comparable results. This work not only offers insights into RBD structural and functional features but also provides an analytical workflow for characterization of new RBDs and batch-to-batch comparison.","Gstöttner, Christoph; Zhang, Tao; Resemann, Anja; Ruben, Sophia; Pengelley, Stuart; Suckau, Detlev; Welsink, Tim; Wuhrer, Manfred; Domínguez-Vega, Elena",Anal Chem,,451
257518,Influence of aging on T cell response and renin-angiotensin system imbalance during SARS-CoV-2 infection,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Desire thinking is defined as a voluntary cognitive activity aimed at imaginatively and verbally elaborating a future scenario of performing a desired behavior. Although not problematic per se, desire thinking can become dysfunctional if it is used to regulate negative mood states and due to its ability to induce craving. This study tests a mediation model where desire thinking is hypothesized to mediate the association between emotional reactivity and craving among specific online activities. METHODS: The study comprised an online survey that was completed by 925 participants who indicated that their first-choice online activity was one out of social-networks use, shopping, gaming, gambling, or pornography viewing. In this sample, a structural equation model was tested where negative emotional reactivity, desire thinking, and craving were latently modelled in this serial order. RESULTS: Results indicated that higher levels in negative emotional reactivity significantly predicted higher desire thinking tendencies, which in turn significantly predicted higher cravings for online activities. The direct path between negative reactivity and craving was not significant. Further, our results support the two-factorial structure of a German version of the Desire Thinking Questionnaire (Caselli & Spada, 2011). DISCUSSION: The findings show that desire thinking might be initiated as an attempt to regulate negative affective states. This highlights its possible role as a maladaptive coping mechanism in the context of specific online activities due to the resulting craving responses, which in turn could promote the emergence of unwanted behaviors.","Brandtner, Annika; Brand, Matthias",Addict Behav,,451

It is desirable to prioritize disease conditions for which cytoreduction surgery with or without associated hyperthermic intraoperative peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is the gold-standard treatment, and for which systemic chemotherapy cannot be a temporary or long-term alternative: pseudomyxoma peritonei, resectable malignant peritoneal mesotheliomas, peritoneal metastases of colorectal origin if they are resectable and unresponsive to systemic chemotherapy after up to 12 courses, first-line ovarian carcinomatosis if resectable or in interval surgery after at most six courses of systemic chemotherapy.

The main objective of this study was to assess the changes in the frequency of reported physical back pain complaints reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast to other published studies, we target the general population using Twitter as a data source. Specifically, we aim to investigate differences in the number of back pain complaints between the pre-pandemic and during the pandemic. A total of 53,234 and 78,559 tweets were analyzed for November 2019 and November 2020, respectively. Because Twitter users do not always complain explicitly when they tweet about the experience of back pain, we have designed an intelligent filter based on natural language processing (NLP) to automatically classify the examined tweets into the back pain complaining class and other tweets. Analysis of filtered tweets indicated an 84% increase in the back pain complaints reported in November 2020 compared to November 2019. These results might indicate significant changes in lifestyle during the COVID-19 pandemic, including restrictions in daily body movements and reduced exposure to routine physical exercise.","Fiok, K.; Karwowski, W.; Gutierrez, E.; Saeidi, M.; Aljuaid, A.

261872,SARS-CoV-2 vaccination modelling for safe surgery to save lives: data from an international prospective cohort study,2021,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 response, nonclinical essential workers usually worked overtime and experienced significant work stress, which subsequently increased their risk of mortality due to cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and pre-existing conditions. Deaths on duty, including deaths due to overwork, during the COVID-19 response were usually reported on web-based platforms for public recognition and solidarity. Although no official statistics are available for these casualties, a list of on-duty deaths has been made publicly available on the web by crowdsourcing. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the trends and characteristics of deaths related to overwork among the frontline nonclinical essential workers participating in nonpharmaceutical interventions during the first wave of COVID-19 in China. METHODS: Based on a web-based crowdsourced list of deaths on duty during the first wave of the COVID-19 response in China, we manually verified all overwork-related death records against the full-text web reports from credible sources. After excluding deaths caused by COVID-19 infection and accidents, a total of 340 deaths related to overwork among nonclinical essential workers were attributed to combatting the COVID-19 crisis. We coded the key characteristics of the deceased workers, including sex, age at death, location, causes of death, date of incidence, date of death, containment duties, working area, and occupation. The temporal and spatial correlations between deaths from overwork and COVID-19 cases in China were also examined using Pearson correlation coefficient. RESULTS: From January 20 to April 26, 2020, at least 340 nonclinical frontline workers in China were reported to have died as a result of overwork while combatting COVID-19. The weekly overwork mortality was positively correlated with weekly COVID-19 cases (r=0.79, P<.001). Two-thirds of deceased workers (230/340, 67.6%) were under 55 years old, and two major causes of deaths related to overwork were cardiovascular diseases (138/340, 40.6%) and cerebrovascular diseases (73/340, 21.5%). Outside of Hubei province, there were almost 2.5 times as many deaths caused by COVID-19-related overwork (308/340, 90.6%) than by COVID-19 itself (n=120). CONCLUSIONS: The high number of deaths related to overwork among nonclinical essential workers at the frontline of the COVID-19 epidemic is alarming. Policies for occupational health protection against work hazards should therefore be prioritized and enforced.","Wang, Zhicheng; Lin, Leesa; Guo, Yan; Xiong, Huayi; Tang, Kun",J Med Internet Res,,451

264390,Planned haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in a 17-month-old patient with high-risk acute myeloid leukaemia and persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection,2021,"The 2019-novel coronavirus also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a common threat to animals and humans, and is responsible for the human SARS pandemic in 2019 to 2021. The infection of SARS-CoV-2 in humans involves a viral surface glycoprotein named as spike proteins, which bind to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) proteins. Particularly, the receptor binding domains (RBDs) mediate the interaction and contain several disordered regions, which help in the binding. Investigations on the influence of disordered residues/regions in stability and binding of spike protein with ACE2 help to understand the disease pathogenesis, which has not yet been studied. In this study, we have used molecular-dynamics simulations to characterize the structural changes in disordered regions of the spike protein that result from ACE2 binding. We observed that the disordered regions undergo disorder-to-order transition (DOT) upon binding with ACE2, and the DOT residues are located at functionally important regions of RBD. Although the RBD is having rigid structure, DOT residues make conformational rearrangements for the spike protein to attach with ACE2. The binding is strengthened via hydrophilic and aromatic amino acids mainly present in the DOTs. The positively correlated motions of the DOT residues with its nearby residues also explain the binding profile of RBD with ACE2, and the residues are observed to be contributing more favorable binding energies for the spike-ACE2 complex formation. This study emphasizes that intrinsically disordered residues in the RBD of spike protein may provide insights into its etiology and be useful for drug and vaccine discovery.","Yesudhas, Dhanusha; Srivastava, Ambuj; Sekijima, Masakazu; Gromiha, M Michael",Proteins,,451

265582,Humoral and Cellular Responses to mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines Administered to Hemodialysis Patients,2021,"BACKGROUND: Despite the limitations in the use of cycle threshold (CT) values for individual patient care, population distributions of CT values may be useful indicators of local outbreaks. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to conduct an exploratory analysis of potential correlations between the population distribution of cycle threshold (CT) values and COVID-19 dynamics, which were operationalized as percent positivity, transmission rate (Rt), and COVID-19 hospitalization count. METHODS: In total, 148,410 specimens collected between September 15, 2020, and January 11, 2021, from the greater El Paso area were processed in the Dascena COVID-19 Laboratory. The daily median CT value, daily Rt, daily count of COVID-19 hospitalizations, daily change in percent positivity, and rolling averages of these features were plotted over time. Two-way scatterplots and linear regression were used to evaluate possible associations between daily median CT values and outbreak measures. Cross-correlation plots were used to determine whether a time delay existed between changes in daily median CT values and measures of community disease dynamics. RESULTS: Daily median CT values negatively correlated with the daily Rt values (P<.001), the daily COVID-19 hospitalization counts (with a 33-day time delay; P<.001), and the daily changes in percent positivity among testing samples (P<.001). Despite visual trends suggesting time delays in the plots for median CT values and outbreak measures, a statistically significant delay was only detected between changes in median CT values and COVID-19 hospitalization counts (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the literature by analyzing samples collected from an entire geographical area and contextualizing the results with other research investigating population CT values.","Tso, Chak Foon; Garikipati, Anurag; Green-Saxena, Abigail; Mao, Qingqing; Das, Ritankar",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,451

268145,New Insights Into the Physiopathology of COVID-19: SARS-CoV-2-Associated Gastrointestinal Illness,2021,"Detection of asymptomatic or subclinical novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical for understanding the overall prevalence and infection potential of COVID-19. To estimate the cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in China, we evaluated the host serologic response, measured by the levels of immunoglobulins M and G in 17,368 individuals, in the city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, and geographic regions in the country, during the period from 9 March 2020 to 10 April 2020. In our cohorts, the seropositivity in Wuhan varied between 3.2% and 3.8% in different subcohorts. Seroposivity progressively decreased in other cities as the distance to the epicenter increased. Patients who visited a hospital for maintenance hemodialysis and healthcare workers also had a higher seroprevalence of 3.3% (51 of 1,542, 2.5-4.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI)) and 1.8% (81 of 4,384, 1.5-2.3%, 95% CI), respectively. More studies are needed to determine whether these results are generalizable to other populations and geographic locations, as well as to determine at what rate seroprevalence is increasing with the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. Serologic surveillance has the potential to provide a more faithful cumulative viral attack rate for the first season of this novel SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Xu, Xin; Sun, Jian; Nie, Sheng; Li, Huiyuan; Kong, Yaozhong; Liang, Min; Hou, Jinlin; Huang, Xianzhong; Li, Dongfeng; Ma, Tean; Peng, Jiaqing; Gao, Shikui; Shao, Yong; Zhu, Hong; Lau, Johnson Yiu-Nam; Wang, Guangyu; Xie, Chunbao; Jiang, Li; Huang, Ailong; Yang, Zhenglin; Zhang, Kang; Hou, Fan Fan",Nat. med,,451
269795,Donor to recipient transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by lung transplantation despite negative donor upper respiratory tract testing,2021,"Extensive glycosylation of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus not only shields the major part of it from host immune responses, but glycans at specific sites also act on its conformation dynamics and contribute to efficient host receptor binding, and hence infectivity. As variants of concern arise during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is unclear if mutations accumulated within the spike protein would affect its site-specific glycosylation pattern. The Alpha variant derived from the D614G lineage is distinguished from others by having deletion mutations located right within an immunogenic supersite of the spike N-terminal domain that make it refractory to most neutralizing antibodies directed against this domain. Despite maintaining an overall similar structural conformation, our mass spectrometry-based site-specific glycosylation analyses of similarly produced spike proteins with and without the D614G and Alpha variant mutations reveal a significant shift in the processing state of N-glycans on one specific N-terminal domain site. Its conversion to a higher proportion of complex type structures is indicative of altered spatial accessibility attributable to mutations specific to the Alpha variant that may impact its transmissibility. This and other more subtle changes in glycosylation features detected at other sites provide crucial missing information otherwise not apparent in the available cryogenic electron microscopy-derived structures of the spike protein variants.","Kuo, Chu-Wei; Yang, Tzu-Jing; Chien, Yu-Chun; Yu, Pei-Yu; Hsu, Shang-Te Danny; Khoo, Kay-Hooi",,,451

METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of the proband and her parents. Whole exome sequencing was used to screen pathogenic variant in the proband. Suspected variant was verified by Sanger sequencing. Impact of the variant on the structure and function of protein product was analyzed by using bioinformatic software. RESULTS: Sanger sequencing showed that the proband has carried homozygous missense c.1342G>A (p.Gly448Ala) variant of the MCCC2 gene, for which her mother was a heterozygous carrier. The same variant was not detected in her father. The variant was predicted to be pathogenic by PolyPhen-2 and Mutation Taster software, and the site was highly conserved among various species. Based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics standards and guidelines, the c.1342G>A (p.Gly448Ala) variant of MCCC2 gene was predicted to be likely pathogenic(PM2+PP2-PP5). CONCLUSION: The homozygous missense variant of the MCCC2 gene c.1342G>A (p.Gly448Ala) probably underlay the molecular pathogenesis of the proband.

The study's objective was to examine whether subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) hospitalisations and ruptured aneurysm coiling interventions demonstrated similar declines. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, retrospective, observational study across 6 continents, 37 countries and 140 comprehensive stroke centres. Patients with the diagnosis of SAH, aneurysmal SAH, ruptured aneurysm coiling interventions and COVID-19 were identified by prospective aneurysm databases or by International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, codes. The 3-month cumulative volume, monthly volumes for SAH hospitalisations and ruptured aneurysm coiling procedures were compared for the period before (1 year and immediately before) and during the pandemic, defined as 1 March-31 May 2020. The prior 1-year control period (1 March-31 May 2019) was obtained to account for seasonal variation. FINDINGS: There was a significant decline in SAH hospitalisations, with 2044 admissions in the 3 months immediately before and 1585 admissions during the pandemic, representing a relative decline of 22.5% (95% CI -24.3% to -20.7%, p<0.0001). Embolisation of ruptured aneurysms declined with 1170-1035 procedures, respectively, representing an 11.5% (95%CI -13.5% to -9.8%, p=0.002) relative drop. Subgroup analysis was noted for aneurysmal SAH hospitalisation decline from 834 to 626 hospitalisations, a 24.9% relative decline (95% CI -28.0% to -22.1%, p<0.0001). A relative increase in ruptured aneurysm coiling was noted in low coiling volume hospitals of 41.1% (95% CI 32.3% to 50.6%, p=0.008) despite a decrease in SAH admissions in this tertile. INTERPRETATION: There was a relative decrease in the volume of SAH hospitalisations, aneurysmal SAH hospitalisations and ruptured aneurysm embolisations during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings in SAH are consistent with a decrease in other emergencies, such as stroke and myocardial infarction.","Nguyen, Thanh N; Haussen, Diogo C; Qureshi, Muhammad M; Yamagami, Hiroshi; Fujinaka, Toshiyuki; Mansour, Ossama Y; Abdalkader, Mohamad; Frankel, Michael; Qiu, Zhongming; Taylor, Allan; Lylyk, Pedro; Eker, Omer F; Mechtouff, Laura; Piotin, Michel; Lima, Fabricio Oliveira; Mont039,; Alverne, Francisco; Izzath, Wazim; Sakai, Nobuyuki; Mohammaden, Mahmoud; Al-Bayati, Alhamza R; Renieri, Leonardo; Mangiafico, Salvatore; Ozretic, David; Chalumeau, Vanessa; Ahmad, Saima; Rashid, Umair; Hussain, Syed Irteza; John, Seby; Griffin, Emma; Thornton, John; Fiorot, Jose Antonio; Rivera, Rodrigo; Hammami, Nadia; Cervantes-Arslanian, Anna M; Dasenbrock, Hormuzdiyar H; Vu, Huynh Le; Nguyen, Viet Quy; Hetts, Steven; Bourcier, Romain; Guile, Romain; Walker, Melanie; Sharma, Malveeka; Frei, Don; Jabbour, Pascal; Herial, Nabeel; Al-Mufti, Fawaz; Ozdemir, Atilla Ozcan; Aykac, Ozlem; Gandhi, Dheeraj; Chugh, Chandril",Stroke vasc. neurol.

The prevalence of COVID-19 among older adults in independent/assisted living is not understood. Objectives: To conduct surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 and describe symptoms of COVID-19 among residents and staff of an independent/assisted living community. Design, Setting, and Participants: In March 2020, public health surveillance of staff and residents was conducted on site at an assisted and independent living residence for older adults in Seattle, Washington, after exposure to 2 residents who were hospitalized with COVID-19. Exposures: Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a congregate setting implementing social isolation and infection prevention protocols. Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs from residents and staff; a symptom questionnaire was completed assessing fever, cough, and other symptoms for the preceding 14 days. Residents were retested for SARS-CoV-2 7 days after initial screening. Results: Testing was performed on 80 residents; 62 were women (77%), with mean age of 86 (range, 69-102) years. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 3 of 80 residents (3.8%); none felt ill, 1 male resident reported resolved cough and 1 loose stool during the preceding 14 days. Virus was also detected in 2 of 62 staff (3.2%); both were symptomatic. One week later, resident SARS-CoV-2 testing was repeated and 1 new infection detected (asymptomatic). All residents remained in isolation and were clinically stable 14 days after the second test. Conclusions and Relevance: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic residents highlights challenges in protecting older adults living in congregate settings. In this study, symptom screening failed to identify residents with infections and all 4 residents with SARS-CoV-2 remained asymptomatic after 14 days. Although 1 asymptomatic infection was found on retesting, a widespread facility outbreak was avoided. Compared with skilled nursing settings, in assisted/independent living communities, early surveillance to identify asymptomatic persons among residents and staff, in combination with adherence to recommended preventive strategies, may reduce viral spread.","Roxby, Alison C; Greninger, Alexander L; Hatfield, Kelly M; Lynch, John B; Dellit, Timothy H; James, Allison; Taylor, Joanne; Page, Libby C; Kimball, Anne; Arons, Melissa; Munanga, Albert; Stone, Nimalie; Jernigan, John A; Reddy, Sujan C; Lewis, James; Cohen, Seth A; Jerome, Keith R; Duchin, Jeffrey S; Neme, Santiago",JAMA Intern Med,,451

Although the essential role of sleep in healing has long been recognized, excessive noise in hospital environments remains a persistent and pervasive problem. For hospitalized patients, environmental noise can result in sleep deprivation and adverse health outcomes; not surprisingly, hospital noise ranks as a major patient complaint. At a small suburban community hospital, patients responding to a quiet-at-night question in the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey gave the hospital's telemetry unit the lowest possible score: 1 out of 5 points. In response, the unit's quality improvement team, coordinated by a clinical nurse leader, introduced a holistic ""sleep menu"" intervention. The multicomponent intervention subsequently improved patients' care experience and staff engagement. The percentage of patients who self-reported five or more hours of uninterrupted sleep rose from 31% at baseline to 80% during the intervention. This improvement was sustained over the three-month intervention period and led to a quiet-at-night HCAHPS score of 4.

We detected SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells by MHC class I multimer staining and examined their phenotypes and functions in acute and convalescent COVID-19. Multimer+ cells exhibited early differentiated effector-memory phenotypes in the early convalescent phase. The frequency of stem-like memory cells was increased among multimer+ cells in the late convalescent phase. Cytokine secretion assays combined with MHC class I multimer staining revealed that the proportion of interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³)-producing cells was significantly lower among SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells than those specific to influenza A virus. Importantly, the proportion of IFN-Î³-producing cells was higher in PD-1+ cells than PD-1- cells among multimer+ cells, indicating that PD-1-expressing, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells are not exhausted, but functional.

Many cities are experiencing air quality improvements due to human activity restrictions. The purpose of this study was to compare the air quality between 2020 and the previous three years, focusing on the two cities (Seoul and Daegu) where coronavirus is spreading the fastest in Korea. Significant decreases in PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;, PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, CO, and NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were observed in both cities. In particular, compared to the same period of 2017-2019, in March 2020, PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; showed remarkable reductions of 36% and 30% in Seoul and Daegu, respectively. The effects of social distancing have maximized improvements in air quality due to reduced transboundary pollutants. The PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;/PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; ratio was significantly reduced after social distancing, indicating that the contribution of traffic-related PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; declined.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the prevalence of anxiety in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two researchers independently searched for cross-sectional community-based studies published between December 1, 2019 and August 23, 2020, using PubMed, WoS, Embase, and other sources (e.g., grey literature, manual search). RESULTS: Of 3049 records retrieved, 43 studies were included. These studies yielded an estimated overall prevalence of anxiety of 25%, which varied significantly across the different tools used to measure anxiety. Consistently reported risk factors for the development of anxiety included initial or peak phase of the outbreak, female sex, younger age, marriage, social isolation, unemployment and student status, financial hardship, low educational level, insufficient knowledge of COVID-19, epidemiological or clinical risk of disease and some lifestyle and personality variables. CONCLUSIONS: As the overall global prevalence of anxiety disorders is estimated to be 7.3% normally, our results suggest that rates of anxiety in the general population could be more than 3 times higher during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings suggest a substantial impact on mental health that should be targeted by individual and population-level strategies.","Santabárbara, Javier; Lasheras, Isabel; Lipnicki, Darren M; Bueno-Notivol, Juan; Pérez-Moreno, María; López-Antón, Raúl; De la Cámara, Concepción; Lobo, Antonio; Gracia-García, Patricia",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,,451

Neighborhood deprivation has been observed to be associated with poorer health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between neighborhood deprivation and COVID-19 in Louisiana. METHODS: The Area Deprivation Index (ADI) was calculated and used to classify neighborhood deprivation at the census tract level. A total of 17 US census variables were used to calculate the ADI for each of the 1148 census tracts in Louisiana. The data were extracted from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2018. The neighborhoods were categorized into quintiles as well as low and high deprivation. The publicly available COVID-19 cumulative case counts by census tract were obtained from the Louisiana Department of Health website on July 31, 2020. Descriptive and Poisson regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Neighborhoods in Louisiana were substantially different with respect to deprivation. The ADI ranged from 136.00 for the most deprived neighborhood and -33.87 in the least deprived neighborhood. We observed that individuals residing in the most deprived neighborhoods had almost a 40% higher risk of COVID-19 compared to those residing in the least deprived neighborhoods. CONCLUSION: While the majority of previous studies were focused on very limited socio-environmental factors such as crowding and income, this study used a composite area-based deprivation index to examine the role of neighborhood environment on COVID-19. We observed a positive relationship between neighborhood deprivation and COVID-19 risk in Louisiana. The study findings can be utilized to promote public health preventions measures besides social distancing, wearing a mask while in public and frequent handwashing in vulnerable neighborhoods with greater deprivation.","K C, Madhav; Oral, Evrim; Straif-Bourgeois, Susanne; Rung, Ariane L; Peters, Edward S",PLoS One,,451

The Krebs Von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) as a sensitive marker reflects the degree of fibrosis and this study will focus on analyzing the evaluative efficacy and predictive role of KL-6 in COVID-19 secondary pulmonary fibrosis. The study lasted more than three months and included total 289 COVID-19 patients who were divided into moderate (n=226) and severe groups (n=63) according to the severity of illness. Clinical information such as inflammation indicators, radiological results and lung function tests were collected. The time points of nucleic acid test were also recorded. Furthermore, based on Chest radiology detection, it was identified that 80 (27.7%) patients developed reversible pulmonary fibrosis and 34 (11.8%) patients developed irreversible pulmonary fibrosis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis shows that KL-6 could diagnose the severity of COVID-19 (AUC=0.862) and predict the occurrence of pulmonary fibrosis (AUC = 0.741) and irreversible pulmonary fibrosis (AUC=0.872). Importantly, the cross-correlation analysis demonstrates that KL-6 rises earlier than the development of lung radiology fibrosis, thus also illuminating the predictive function of KL-6. We set specific values (505U/mL and 674U/mL) for KL-6 in order to assess the risk of pulmonary fibrosis after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The survival curves for days in hospital show that the higher the KL-6 levels, the longer the hospital stay (P<0.0001). In conclusion, KL-6 could be used as an important predictor to evaluate the secondary pulmonary fibrosis degree for COVID-19.","Xue, Mingshan; Zhang, Teng; Chen, Hao; Zeng, Yifeng; Lin, Runpei; Zhen, Yingjie; Li, Ning; Huang, Zhifeng; Hu, Haisheng; Zhou, Luqian; Wang, Hui; Zhang, Xiaohua Douglas; Sun, Baoqing",Int J Biol Sci,,451

More information is needed about racial and ethnic differences in outcomes from Covid-19. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed data from patients seen within an integrated-delivery health system (Ochsner Health) in Louisiana between March 1 and April 11, 2020, who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19) on qualitative polymerase-chain-reaction assay. The Ochsner Health population is 31% black non-Hispanic and 65% white non-Hispanic. The primary outcomes were hospitalization and in-hospital death. RESULTS: A total of 3626 patients tested positive, of whom 145 were excluded (84 had missing data on race or ethnic group, 9 were Hispanic, and 52 were Asian or of another race or ethnic group). Of the 3481 Covid-19-positive patients included in our analyses, 60.0% were female, 70.4% were black non-Hispanic, and 29.6% were white non-Hispanic. Black patients had higher prevalences of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease than white patients. A total of 39.7% of Covid-19-positive patients (1382 patients) were hospitalized, 76.9% of whom were black. In multivariable analyses, black race, increasing age, a higher score on the Charlson Comorbidity Index (indicating a greater burden of illness), public insurance (Medicare or Medicaid), residence in a low-income area, and obesity were associated with increased odds of hospital admission. Among the 326 patients who died from Covid-19, 70.6% were black. In adjusted time-to-event analyses, variables that were associated with higher in-hospital mortality were increasing age and presentation with an elevated respiratory rate; elevated levels of venous lactate, creatinine, or procalcitonin; or low platelet or lymphocyte counts. However, black race was not independently associated with higher mortality (hazard ratio for death vs. white race, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.68 to 1.17). CONCLUSIONS: In a large cohort in Louisiana, 76.9% of the patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19 and 70.6% of those who died were black, whereas blacks comprise only 31% of the Ochsner Health population. Black race was not associated with higher in-hospital mortality than white race, after adjustment for differences in sociodemographic and clinical characteristics on admission.","Price-Haywood, Eboni G; Burton, Jeffrey; Fort, Daniel; Seoane, Leonardo",N Engl J Med,,451
282034,Variability between testing methods for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection 16 days post-discharge: a case report,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Since its emergence in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic that has significantly challenged healthcare systems. Healthcare workers have previously been shown to have experienced higher rates of infection than the general population. We aimed to assess the extent of infection in staff working in our healthcare setting. DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of antibody results, compared with staff demographic data, and exposure to patients with COVID-19 infection. SETTING: A large teaching hospital in the North West of England. PARTICIPANTS: 4474 staff in diverse clinical and non-patient facing roles who volunteered for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing by the Roche Elecsys assay between 29 May and 4 July 2020. RESULTS: Seroprevalence was 17.4%. Higher rates were seen in Asian/Asian British (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.04) and Black/Black British (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.45) staff. Staff working in any clinical location were more likely to be seropositive (OR 2.68, 95% 2.27 to 3.15). Staff were at an increased risk of seropositivity as the 'per 100 COVID-19 bed-days change' increased in the clinical area in which they worked (OR 1.12, 95% 1.10 to 1.14). Staff working in critical care were no more likely to have detectable antibodies than staff working in non-clinical areas. Symptoms compatible with COVID-19 were reported in 41.8% and antibodies were detected in 30.7% of these individuals. In staff who reported no symptoms, antibodies were detected in 7.7%. In all staff who had detectable antibodies, 25.2% reported no symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Staff working in clinical areas where patients with COVID-19 were nursed were more likely to have detectable antibodies. The relationship between seropositivity in healthcare workers and the increase in 'per 100 COVID-19 bed-days' of the area in which they worked, although statistically significant, was weak, suggesting other contributing factors to the risk profile. Of staff with detectable antibodies and therefore evidence of prior infection, a quarter self-reported that they had experienced no compatible symptoms. This has implications for potential unrecorded transmission in both staff and patients.","Shorten, Robert John; Haslam, Shonagh; Hurley, Margaret A; Rowbottom, Anthony; Myers, M; Wilkinson, Paul; Orr, David",BMJ Open,,451

No study has examined the volume and nature of AIS hospitalizations among older adults in the U.S. amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. This study examined the trend and compared the characteristics of Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries ≥65 years hospitalized with a primary AIS diagnosis in the same timeframe before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We included hospitalizations with a primary diagnosis of AIS (ICD-10 I63) among Medicare FFS beneficiaries from week 11 to 24 in 2019 and 2020. We estimated the percent reduction of AIS hospitalizations between 2019 and 2020 by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and state. We tested for difference in distribution by age group, sex and race/ethnicity between 2019 and 2020 based on χ2 test. Results: During the 14-weeks from March 8 to June 13, 2020, AIS hospitalizations among FFS beneficiaries were reduced by 23.7% compared to weeks 11 to 24 in 2019 (March 10 to June 15) (49,607 in 2019 vs. 37,860 in 2020). A greater percent reduction in AIS hospitalizations was observed with older age (27.2% among ≥85 years vs. 20.6% among persons 65-74 years, p&lt;0.001). The magnitude of reduction was similar between men (23.8%) and women (23.6%, p=0.791), and among non-Hispanic white (24.2%), non-Hispanic black (22.4%), Hispanic (19.3%), and other (22.4%, p=0.189). AIS hospitalization trends varied by state ranging from 1.6% in New Hampshire to 39.8% in Montana. Conclusion: Hospitalizations with a primary AIS diagnosis among Medicare FFS beneficiaries were reduced by 24% during weeks 11 to 24 of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the previous year in the United States. AIS hospitalization reductions varied substantially by state. Further study is needed to examine the long-term effects of COVID-19 pandemic on stroke outcomes.","Yang, Q.; Tong, X.; King, S.

Despite the highest scientific efforts and investments, a reliable and certified medication has yet to be developed regarding to immune or cure this virus. However, while synthetic medications are gaining the focus of attentions, it appears from a significant number of recent studies that plant-based substances could also be potential candidates for developing effective and secure remedies against this novel disease. Citing such recent works, this review primarily demonstrates the antiviral potentials of medicinal plants for inhibiting human coronaviruses.

287564,Tracheotomy in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,2020,"COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been a pandemic since WHO made the statement on March 11, 2020. The infection is causing a high mortality in old people, especially those with obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D) or cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Extra cautions are needed in the treatment of those patients. The CVD drugs ACEIs and ARBs, as well as the T2D drugs GLP-1R agonists, were shown to activate angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression in experimental animals. Elevated ACE2 expression may accelerate virus entrance into the host cells during the infection for its replication. However, expression of the soluble ACE2, may neutralize the virus to limit the infection and replication. Given that obese, diabetes and CVD patients often take those medicines in the treatment and prevention of blood pressure and glucose elevation, it remains to be determined whether those medicines represent friend or foe in the treatment of COVID-19. We suggest that retrospective studies should be conducted to determine the exact impact of those medicines in obese, diabetic, or CVD patients who had COVID-19. Results obtained will provide guidance whether those drugs can be utilized in COVID-19 patients with obesity, diabetic, or CVD.","Pang, Juan; Liu, Mingyao; Ling, Wenhua; Jin, Tianru",Obes Med,,451

Genomic surveillance for identifying variants would better inform resource allocation and hotspot control. Yet, the implementation of variant surveillance has been regionally variable and prohibitively slow. To improve the availability of variant surveillance, we describe a variant genotyping system that is rapid, accurate, adaptable, and able to detect new low-level variants built with existing hospital infrastructure. MethodsWe use a tiered high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 screening program to characterizes variants in a supra-regional health system over 76 days. Combining targeted qPCR and selective sequencing, we screen positive SARS-CoV-2 samples from all hospitals within our health care system for genotyping dominant and emerging variants. ResultsThe median turn-around for genotyping was two days using the high-throughput qPCR-based screen, allowing us to rapidly characterize the emerging Delta variant. Consistent with prior work, in our population, the Delta variant is associated with a lower CT value (a surrogate for viral load), lower age at infection, and increased vaccine breakthrough cases. Detection of low-level and potentially emerging variants highlights the utility of a tiered approach. ConclusionsThese findings underscore the need for fast, low-cost, high-throughput monitoring of regional viral sequences as the pandemic unfolds and the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants increases. Combing qPCR-based screening with selective sequencing allows for rapid genotyping of variants and dynamic system improvement. Key messagesO_LIA tiered approach that uses qPCR-based screening to identify dominant variants and sequencing for unique variants maximizes throughput, turn-around time, and information gleaned from each sample.

STUDY DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study reviewing pediatric patients with SARS (n = 43) and COVID-19 (n = 244) who were admitted to the Princess Margaret Hospital in Hong Kong and Wuhan Children's Hospital in Wuhan, respectively. Demographics, hospital length of stay, and clinical and laboratory features were compared. RESULTS: Overall, 97.7% of patients with SARS and 85.2% of patients with COVID-19 had epidemiologic associations with known cases. Significantly more patients with SARS developed fever, chills, myalgia, malaise, coryza, sore throat, sputum production, nausea, headache, and dizziness than patients with COVID-19. No patients with SARS were asymptomatic at the time of admission, whereas 29.1% and 20.9% of patients with COVID-19 were asymptomatic on admission and throughout their hospital stay, respectively. More patients with SARS required oxygen supplementation than patients with COVID-19 (18.6 vs 4.7%; P = .004). Only 1.6% of patients with COVID-19 and 2.3% of patients with SARS required mechanical ventilation. Leukopenia (37.2% vs 18.6%; P = .008), lymphopenia (95.4% vs 32.6%; P < .01), and thrombocytopenia (41.9% vs 3.8%; P < .001) were significantly more common in patients with SARS than in patients with COVID-19. The duration between positive and negative nasopharyngeal aspirate and the length in hospital stay were similar in patients with COVID-19, regardless of whether they were asymptomatic or symptomatic, suggesting a similar duration of viral shedding.

Subjects were randomised into VD and NVD groups. VD group received Pulse D therapy (targeted daily supplementation of 60,000 IUs of vitamin D for 8 or 10 days depending upon their BMI) in addition to the standard treatment. NVD group received standard treatment alone. Differences in the variables between the two groups were analysed for statistical significance. Eighty seven out of one hundred and thirty subjects have completed the study (VD:44, NVD:43). Vitamin D level has increased from 16 ± 6 ng/ml to 89 ± 32 ng/ml after Pulse D therapy in VD group and highly significant (p < 0.01) reduction of all the measured inflammatory markers was noted. Reduction of markers in NVD group was insignificant (p > 0.05). The difference in the reduction of markers between the groups (NVD vs VD) was highly significant (p < 0.01). Therapeutic improvement in vitamin D to 80-100 ng/ml has significantly reduced the inflammatory markers associated with COVID-19 without any side effects.

The relocation of individuals has significant implications given the COVID-19 pandemic and variability of the outbreak across the United States, but little is known about the extent of the geographic relocation taking place. Objective: We reported historical trends of PGY-1 residents staying in-state and those starting residency from out-of-state to quantify the geographic movement of individuals beginning residency training each year. Methods: We analyzed historical data collected by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education in academic years 2016-2017, 2017-2018, and 2018-2019, comparing the locations of medical school and residency programs for PGY-1 residents to determine the number of matriculants from in-state medical schools and out-of-state medical schools. International medical school graduates (IMGs) were shown separately in the analysis and then combined with out-of-state matriculants. US citizens who trained abroad were counted among IMGs. Results: The total number of PGY-1s increased by 10.3% during the 3-year time period, from 29 338 to 32 348. When combined, IMGs and USMGs transitioning from one state or country to another state accounted for approximately 72% of PGY-1s each year. Approximately 63% of USMGs matriculated to a residency program in a new state, and IMGs made up 24.6% to 23.1% of PGY-1s over the 3-year period. Conclusions: Each year brings a substantial amount of movement among PGY-1s that highlights the need for policies and procedures specific to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Byrne, Lauren M; Holmboe, Eric S; Combes, John R; Nasca, Thomas J",J Grad Med Educ,,451

The aim was to investigate and validate the association between MPAD enlargement and overall survival in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This is a cohort study on 1469 consecutive COVID-19 patients submitted to chest CT within 72 h from admission in seven tertiary level hospitals in Northern Italy, between March 1 and April 20, 2020. Derivation cohort (n = 761) included patients from the first three participating hospitals; validation cohort (n = 633) included patients from the remaining hospitals. CT images were centrally analyzed in a core-lab blinded to clinical data. The prognostic value of MPAD on overall survival was evaluated at adjusted and multivariable Cox's regression analysis on the derivation cohort. The final multivariable model was tested on the validation cohort. RESULTS: In the derivation cohort, the median age was 69 (IQR, 58-77) years and 537 (70.6%) were males. In the validation cohort, the median age was 69 (IQR, 59-77) years with 421 (66.5%) males. Enlarged MPAD (&#8805; 31 mm) was a predictor of mortality at adjusted (hazard ratio, HR [95%CI]: 1.741 [1.253-2.418], p < 0.001) and multivariable regression analysis (HR [95%CI]: 1.592 [1.154-2.196], p = 0.005), together with male gender, old age, high creatinine, low well-aerated lung volume, and high pneumonia extension (c-index [95%CI] = 0.826 [0.796-0.851]). Model discrimination was confirmed on the validation cohort (c-index [95%CI] = 0.789 [0.758-0.823]), also using CT measurements from a second reader (c-index [95%CI] = 0.790 [0.753;0.825]).

303562,[Red lines or staffing definition in nursing]./ Untergrenzen oder Personalbemessung in der Pflege,2021,"Introduction Cytokine release syndrome has become the hallmark of moderate-to-severe COVID-19 and immune modulation with steroids has grown into the cornerstone treatment. Many therapeutic approaches had been proposed without much success in Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs). Tocilizumab showed promising results on retrospective cohort studies and its initial use was based on its mechanism of action and physiopathology of the disease. Here, we performed a one-outcome metanalysis on 28-day-mortality in retrospective cohort studies and RCTs in patients with COVID-19. Methods We performed a systematic search of the PubMed, EMBASE and medRxiv databases to identify relevant studies. Studies retrieved identified observational studies and RCTs comparing Tocilizumab versus standard-of-care (control group) or placebo in patients hospitalized with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. All-cause mortality at 28 days was the only outcome reported. We used the inverse variance method with the Paule-Mandel estimator of Tau2 and Hartung-Knapp adjustment to report pooled hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). All statistical analyses were in R version 3.6.2. Results We include five retrospective cohort studies and six RCTs in our analysis. 28-day-mortality was the sole outcome measured. 2459 patients were included in the retrospective cohort studies, with 780 (31.7%) in the tocilizumab group and 1679 (68.3%) in the standard-of-care group. In the RCTs, a total of 1314 patients were included. 487 (37%) patients were assigned to tocilizumab group and 827 (63%) to the placebo group. In the retrospective cohort studies, tocilizumab administration was associated with statistically significant mortality reduction at 28 days [HR: 0.36;CI: 0.19-0.68;I2=30%]. In comparison, there was no statistical significance in 28-day-mortality reduction from the RCTs comparing tocilizumab versus placebo [HR: 1.09;CI: 0.88-0.134;I2=0%]. In retrospective cohort studies, P curve analysis reported the possibility of p-hacking, [full p-curve (all values for which p&lt;0.05);right-skewness P-value &lt;0.0366;half p-curve (all values for which p&lt;0.025);right-skewness P-value &lt;0.28]. Discussion Our metanalysis showed in retrospective cohort studies that tocilizumab had a statistically significant (p 0.0017) 28-days mortality reduction in comparison to the RCTs, where no benefit on 28-day mortality was seen (p 0.3456). Based on RCTs, tocilizumab did not show mortality benefit in COVID-19. Compassionate use of novel treatments based on retrospective cohort studies that contain inherent methodological confounders, such as selection bias, can be counterproductive and even detrimental to patient care. These findings highlight the importance of using practice-changing knowledge-based on high-quality RCTs when urgent need of potential treatments for COVID-19 are needed. .","Ibarra, G.; Majmundar, M.; Park, H.; Kumar, A.; Zala, H.; Chaudhari, S.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,451

Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (rRT-PCR) can detect SARS-COV-2 by targeting open reading frame-1 antibodies (ORF1ab), envelope protein, nucleocapsid protein, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes, and the N1, N2, and N3 (3N) target genes. Therefore, rRT-PCR remains the primary method of diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 despite being limited by false-negative results, long turnaround, complex protocols, and a need for skilled personnel. Serological diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is simple and does not require complex techniques and equipment, rendering it suitable for rapid detection and massive screening. However, serological tests cannot confirm SARS-CoV-2, and results will be false-negative when antibody concentrations fall below detection limits. Balancing the increased use of laboratory tests, risk of testing errors, need for tests, burden on healthcare systems, benefits of early diagnosis, and risk of unnecessary exposure is a significant and persistent challenge in diagnosing COVID-19.","Lai, Chih-Cheng; Wang, Cheng-Yi; Ko, Wen-Chien; Hsueh, Po-Ren",J. microbiol. immunol. infect,,451

306147,SARS-CoV-2 and oral ulcers: A causative agent or a predisposing factor?,2020,"In the 10 months since the first confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in the United States on January 20, 2020 (1), approximately 13.8 million cases and 272,525 deaths have been reported in the United States. On October 30, the number of new cases reported in the United States in a single day exceeded 100,000 for the first time, and by December 2 had reached a daily high of 196,227.* With colder weather, more time spent indoors, the ongoing U.S. holiday season, and silent spread of disease, with approximately 50% of transmission from asymptomatic persons (2), the United States has entered a phase of high-level transmission where a multipronged approach to implementing all evidence-based public health strategies at both the individual and community levels is essential. This summary guidance highlights critical evidence-based CDC recommendations and sustainable strategies to reduce COVID-19 transmission. These strategies include 1) universal face mask use, 2) maintaining physical distance from other persons and limiting in-person contacts, 3) avoiding nonessential indoor spaces and crowded outdoor spaces, 4) increasing testing to rapidly identify and isolate infected persons, 5) promptly identifying, quarantining, and testing close contacts of persons with known COVID-19, 6) safeguarding persons most at risk for severe illness or death from infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, 7) protecting essential workers with provision of adequate personal protective equipment and safe work practices, 8) postponing travel, 9) increasing room air ventilation and enhancing hand hygiene and environmental disinfection, and 10) achieving widespread availability and high community coverage with effective COVID-19 vaccines. In combination, these strategies can reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, long-term sequelae or disability, and death, and mitigate the pandemic's economic impact. Consistent implementation of these strategies improves health equity, preserves health care capacity, maintains the function of essential businesses, and supports the availability of in-person instruction for kindergarten through grade 12 schools and preschool. Individual persons, households, and communities should take these actions now to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission from its current high level. These actions will provide a bridge to a future with wide availability and high community coverage of effective vaccines, when safe return to more everyday activities in a range of settings will be possible.","Honein, Margaret A; Christie, Athalia; Rose, Dale A; Brooks, John T; Meaney-Delman, Dana; Cohn, Amanda; Sauber-Schatz, Erin K; Walker, Allison; McDonald, L Clifford; Liburd, Leandris C; Hall, Jeffrey E; Fry, Alicia M; Hall, Aron J; Gupta, Neil; Kuhnert, Wendi L; Yoon, Paula W; Gundlapalli, Adi V; Beach, Michael J; Walke, Henry T",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,451

The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system has successfully been demonstrated to excise or inactivate integrated HIV-1 provirus from infected cells by targeting the long terminal repeat (LTR) region. However, the guide RNAs (gRNAs) have classically avoided transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) that are readily observed and known to be important in human promoters. Although conventionally thought unfavorable due to potential impact on human promoters, our computational pipeline identified gRNA sequences that were predicted to inactivate HIV-1 transcription by targeting the nuclear factor &#954;B (NF-&#954;B) binding sites (gNFKB0, gNFKB1) with a high safety profile (lack of predicted or observed human edits) and broad-spectrum activity (predicted coverage of known viral sequences). Genome-wide, unbiased identification of double strand breaks (DSBs) enabled by sequencing (GUIDE-seq) showed that the gRNAs targeting NF-&#954;B binding sites had no detectable CRISPR-induced off-target edits in HeLa cells. 5' LTR-driven HIV-1 transcription was significantly reduced in three HIV-1 reporter cell lines. These results demonstrate a working model to specifically target well-known TFBSs in the HIV-1 LTR that are readily observed in human promoters to reduce HIV-1 transcription with a high-level safety profile and broad-spectrum activity.","Chung, Cheng-Han; Allen, Alexander G; Atkins, Andrew J; Sullivan, Neil T; Homan, Greg; Costello, Robert; Madrid, Rebekah; Nonnemacher, Michael R; Dampier, Will; Wigdahl, Brian",Mol Ther Nucleic Acids,,451

In this study, the relationship between BCG vaccination status and severity of COVID-19 pneumonia and the factors affecting disease severity were investigated. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted between March and June 2020 in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia, confirmed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 polymerase chain reaction positivity in a nasopharyngeal sample and pulmonary infiltrates in computed chest tomography, in a state hospital in Istanbul, Turkey. Socio-demographic features, body mass index, smoking status, concomitant diseases, income rates and BCG vaccination status of subjects were analyzed. RESULT: The study population comprised 123 adults with COVID-19 pneumonia [mean age = 49·7 years, standard deviation = 13·3 years; 82 (66·7%) male]. While the rate of cases vaccinated with BCG is lower (68·5 versus 88·2%, P = 0·026), mean age (54·0 ± 11·5 years versus 38·3 ± 10·7 years; P < 0·001), diabetes (32·6 versus 5·9%, P = 0·002) and low income (84·3 versus 52·9%, P < 0·001) are higher in patients with severe disease compared to those with mild disease.

STUDY DESIGN: For 34 European countries, publicly available data were collected on daily numbers of COVID-19 deaths, population size, healthcare capacity, government restrictions and their timing, tourism and change in mobility during the pandemic. METHODS: Univariate and multivariate generalised linear models using different selection algorithms (forward, backward, stepwise and genetic algorithm) were analysed with height of COVID-19 daily deaths' peak and time to the peak as dependent variables. RESULTS: The proportion of the population living in urban areas, mobility at the day of first reported death and number of infections when borders were closed were assessed as significant predictors of the height of COVID-19 daily deaths' peak. Testing the model with a variety of selection algorithms provided consistent results. Total hospital bed capacity, population size, the number of foreign travellers and the day of border closure were found to be significant predictors of time to COVID-19 daily deaths' peak. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis demonstrated that countries with higher proportions of the population living in urban areas, countries with lower reduction in mobility at the beginning of the pandemic and countries having more infected people when closing borders experienced a higher peak of COVID-19 deaths. Greater bed capacity, bigger population size and later border closure could result in delaying time to reach the deaths' peak, whereas a high number of foreign travellers could accelerate it.","Jablonska, Katarzyna; Aballéa, Samuel; Toumi, Mondher",Public Health,,451

311813,Cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection: The spectrum of its neurological manifestations,2021,"The latest COVID-19 pandemic reveals that unexpected changes elevate depression bringing people apart, but also calling for social sharing. Yet the impact of depression on social cognition and functioning is not well understood. Assessment of social cognition is crucial not only for a better understanding of major depressive disorder (MDD), but also for screening, intervention, and remediation. Here by applying a novel experimental tool, a Face-n-Food task comprising a set of images bordering on the Giuseppe Arcimboldo style, we assessed the face tuning in patients with MDD and person-by-person matched controls. The key benefit of these images is that single components do not trigger face processing. Contrary to common beliefs, the outcome indicates that individuals with depression express intact face responsiveness. Yet, while in depression face sensitivity is tied with perceptual organization, in typical development, it is knotted with social cognition capabilities. Face tuning in depression, therefore, may rely upon altered behavioral strategies and underwriting brain mechanisms. To exclude a possible camouflaging effect of female social skills, we examined gender impact. Neither in depression nor in typical individuals had females excelled in face tuning. The outcome sheds light on the origins of the face sensitivity and alterations in social functioning in depression and mental well-being at large. Aberrant social functioning in depression is likely to be the result of deeply-rooted maladaptive strategies rather than of poor sensitivity to social signals. This has implications for mental well-being under the current pandemic conditions.","Kubon, Julian; Sokolov, Alexander N; Popp, Rebecca; Fallgatter, Andreas J; Pavlova, Marina A",Cereb. cortex,,451

312411,"SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: not the first, not the last",2021,"There is limited information on the relationships between restrictions linked to COVID-19 and changes in body weight. The aim of the study was to identify the body weight changes and their determinants in the nutritional and socio-demographic context during the COVID-19 pandemic in Polish women. During lockdown in Poland, 34% of women gained weight, while 18% of women reduced weight. As many as 44% of women with obesity before the pandemic increased their body weight, and 74% of women that were underweight reduced their body weight. In a group with weight gain, women increased their body weight by 2.8 kg on average and around 65% of them increased their total food intake. Unhealthy dietary changes and the negative lifestyle changes that comprised of an increase in screen time and a decrease in physical activity were found as key factors associated with weight gain. A higher risk of weight gain was associated with being obese before the pandemic or living in a macroeconomic region &gt;50% of EU-28 GDP, while those younger in age and carrying out remote work had a higher chance of weight loss. Concluding, the specific conditions during lockdown worsened the nutritional status, which may increase the risk of complicatedness and mortality from COVID-19. It seems advisable to create dietary and lifestyle recommendations tailored to the individual needs of women who are underweight or have excessive body weight. More attention should be paid also to environmental impacts.

312875,"The ""Three Italy"" of the COVID-19 epidemic and the possible involvement of SARS-CoV-2 in triggering complications other than pneumonia",2020,"BACKGROUND: Staff and patient safety are of paramount importance while performing a surgical tracheostomy (ST) during the corona virus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The aim was to assess the incidence of COVID-19 infection among the healthcare personnel (HCP) performing ST on COVID-19 patients. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-two HCP participating in 71 ST procedures performed at our institution between 26th March 2020 and 27th May 2020 were identified. A COVID-19 health questionnaire was distributed among staff with their consent. Data related to the presence of COVID-19 symptoms (new onset continuous cough, fever, loss of taste and/or loss of smell) among HCP involved in ST as well as patient related data were collected. RESULTS: Of the HCP who responded, eleven (15%,11/72) reported key COVID-19 symptoms and went into self-isolation. Ten members from this group underwent a COVID-19 swab test and three tested positive. Only one HCP attended hospital for symptomatic treatment, none required hospitalisation. Sixty percent (43/72) of the responders had a COVID-19 antibody test with a positive rate of 18.6% (8/43). Among the patients undergoing a ST, 67% (37/55) required a direct intensive care unit (ICU) admission; the mean age was 58 years (29-78) with a male preponderance (65.5%). The median time from intubation to ST was 15 days (range 5-33,IQR = 9). The overall mortality was 11% (6/55). CONCLUSIONS: ST can be carried out safely with strict adherence to both, personnel protective equipment and ST protocols which are vital to mitigate the potential transmission of COVID-19 to the HCP.","Angamuthu, Natarajan; Geraldine Gagasa, Emelia; Baker, Daryll; Tsui, Janice; D039, Evan; Souza, Rovan",Surg.

313784,Thrombocytopenia following Pfizer and Moderna SARS-CoV-2 vaccination,2021,"Assembly and publication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome in January 2020 enabled the immediate development of tests to detect the new virus. This began the largest global testing programme in history, in which hundreds of millions of individuals have been tested to date. The unprecedented scale of testing has driven innovation in the strategies, technologies and concepts that govern testing in public health. This Review describes the changing role of testing during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the use of genomic surveillance to track SARS-CoV-2 transmission around the world, the use of contact tracing to contain disease outbreaks and testing for the presence of the virus circulating in the environment. Despite these efforts, widespread community transmission has become entrenched in many countries and has required the testing of populations to identify and isolate infected individuals, many of whom are asymptomatic. The diagnostic and epidemiological principles that underpin such population-scale testing are also considered, as are the high-throughput and point-of-care technologies that make testing feasible on a massive scale.","Mercer, Tim R; Salit, Marc",Nat Rev Genet,,451

However, the imaging risk factors for poor clinical outcomes remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to assess the imaging characteristics and risk factors associated with adverse composite endpoints in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: This retrospective cohort study enrolled patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 24 designated hospitals in Jiangsu province, China, between 10 January and 18 February 2020. Clinical and initial CT findings at admission were extracted from medical records. Patients aged < 18 years or without available clinical or CT records were excluded. The composite endpoints were admission to ICU, acute respiratory failure occurrence, or shock during hospitalization. The volume, density, and location of lesions, including ground-glass opacity (GGO) and consolidation, were quantitatively analyzed in each patient. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify the risk factors among age and CT parameters associated with the composite endpoints. Results: In this study, 625 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled; among them, 179 patients without an initial CT at admission and 25 patients aged < 18 years old were excluded and 421 patients were included in analysis. The median age was 48.0 years and the male proportion was 53% (224/421). During the follow-up period, 64 (15%) patients had a composite endpoint. There was an association of older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.06; P = 0.003), larger consolidation lesions in the upper lung (Right: OR, 1.13; 95%CI: 1.03-1.25, P =0.01; Left: OR,1.15; 95%CI: 1.01-1.32; P = 0.04) with increased odds of adverse endpoints. Conclusion: There was an association of older age and larger consolidation in upper lungs on admission with higher odds of poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19.","Yu, Qian; Wang, Yuancheng; Huang, Shan; Liu, Songqiao; Zhou, Zhen; Zhang, Shijun; Zhao, Zhen; Yu, Yizhou; Yang, Yi; Ju, Shenghong",Theranostics,,451
316786,Utility of CDC Screening Guidelines and Autopsy Findings in Identifying Decedents Who Die of SARS-CoV-2 Infection,2021,"PURPOSE: Clinical scores to rapidly assess the severity illness of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) could be considered of help for clinicians. Recently, a specific score (named COVID-GRAM) for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, based on a nationwide Chinese cohort, has been proposed. We routinely applied the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) to predict critical COVID-19. Aim of this study is to compare NEWS2 and COVID-GRAM score. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed data of 121 COVID-19 patients admitted in two Clinics of Infectious Diseases in the Umbria region, Italy. The primary outcome was critical COVID-19 illness defined as admission to the intensive care unit, invasive ventilation, or death. Accuracy of the scores was evaluated with the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Differences between scores were confirmed used Hanley-McNeil test. RESULTS: The NEWS2 AUROC curve measured 0.87 (standard error, SE 0.03; 95% CI 0.80-0.93; p < 0.0001). The COVID-GRAM score AUROC curve measured 0.77 (SE 0.04; 95% CI 0.68-0.85; p < 0.0001). Hanley-McNeil test showed that NEWS2 better predicted severe COVID-19 (Z = 2.03). CONCLUSIONS: The NEWS2 showed superior accuracy to COVID-GRAM score for prediction of critical COVID-19 illness.","De Socio, Giuseppe Vittorio; Gidari, Anna; Sicari, Francesco; Palumbo, Michele; Francisci, Daniela",Infection,,451
318853,Epigenetic Regulation by Non-Coding RNAs in the Avian Immune System,2020,"To explore the value, and influencing factors, of D-dimer on the prognosis of patients with COVID-19. A total of 1,114 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to three designated COVID-19 hospitals in Wuhan, China from January 18, 2020, to March 24, 2020, were included in this study. We examined the relationship between peripheral blood levels of D-dimer, and clinical classification and prognosis, as well as its related influencing factors. D-dimer levels were found to be related to the clinical classification and the prognosis of clinical outcome. D-dimer levels were more likely to be abnormal in severely and critically ill patients compared with mild and ordinary cases, while D-dimer levels of patients who had died were significantly higher than those of surviving patients according to the results of the first and last lab tests. The results from ROC analyses for mortality risk showed that the AUCs of D-dimer were 0.909, YI was 0.765 at the last lab test, and a D-dimer value of 2.025 mg/L was regarded to be the optimal probability cutoff for a prognosis of death. In addition, we found that patients with advanced age, male gender, dyspnea symptoms, and some underlying diseases have a higher D-dimer value (p < 0.05). In short, D-dimer is related to the clinical classification and can be used to evaluate the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. The D-dimer value of 2.025 mg/L was the optimal probability cutoff for judging an outcome of death. Advanced age, male gender, dyspnea symptoms, and some underlying diseases are influencing factors for D-dimer levels, which impacts the prognosis of patients.","He, Xiaokang; Yao, Fei; Chen, Jie; Wang, Yan; Fang, Xiangming; Lin, Xuan; Long, Hui; Wang, Qiang; Wu, Qingming",Sci Rep,,451
319478,Access to Medical Care through Telemedicine during the Sars-cov-2 Pandemic,2020,"ABSTRACT In Brazil, indigenous peoples present a complex reality characterized by a marked social vulnerability that is manifested in health and nutritional indicators. In this scenario, poor sanitary conditions prevail, with a high burden of chronic noncommunicable diseases; infectious/parasitic diseases; and nutritional disorders, including malnutrition and anemia. This situation is reflected in numerous aspects of food insecurity, placing this population in a position of particular vulnerability to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and its effects. The objective of our study was to present a set of preliminary reflections on food insecurity and indigenous protagonism in times of Covid-19. The pandemic has deepened the inequalities that affect the indigenous peoples, with a direct impact on food security conditions. Amid the effects of the pandemic, indigenous protagonism has played a fundamental role in guaranteeing these peoples' rights and access to food, denouncing the absent and slow official responses as acts of institutional violence, which will have serious and lasting effects on the lives of indigenous peoples.","LEITE, Maurício Soares; FERREIRA, Aline Alves; BRESAN, Deise; ARAUJO, Jessica Rasquim; TAVARES, Inara do Nascimento; SANTOS, Ricardo Ventura",Rev.

319987,"Authors' Reply to Cattaneo et al.: ""Comment on: Comparative Population Pharmacokinetics of Darunavir in SARS-CoV-2 Patients vs. HIV Patients: The Role of Interleukin6""",2021,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly worldwide. Given that this contagious viral outbreak is still unfolding, it is urgent to understand the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and explore effective treatments to protect patients from developing a severe illness related to COVID-19. Recently, IFN-&#945; has been considered a potential therapeutic strategy to treat COVID-19 disease, mainly because the innate immune system rapidly produces IFN-&#945; as the first line of defense to combat viral infections. However, IFN-&#945; can also play a role in immunoregulatory effects, causing pathogenic damage and uncontrolled inflammatory responses. There are 13 human IFN-&#945; subtypes that bind to the same receptor and induce different interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, regulating various antiviral and immunoregulatory effects. The varying degrees of inflammatory regulations may raise concerns about the possible side effects to enlarge the inflammatory responses, exacerbating the severity of infection. Thus, the analysis of various IFN-&#945; subtype induction during SARS-CoV-2 infection is necessary in exploring the mechanism of COVID-19 pathogenesis. This review summarizes the current understanding of IFN-&#945; in the pathogenesis of respiratory virus diseases and IFN-&#945; based clinical intervention used in SARS-CoV-2 infection and other respiratory virus diseases. Besides, new ideas in selecting suitable IFN-&#945; subtypes or combinations as drug candidates for viral infection treatment will also be discussed.Key Pointsâ¢ IFN-&#945; plays an important role in anti-viral and immunoregulatory effects in COVID-19 patients caused by SARS-CoV-2.â¢ The uncontrolled inflammation and disease severity correlated to the diversity of IFN-&#945; subtype induction.â¢ Selecting suitable IFN-&#945; subtypes or combinations as drug candidates will be beneficial for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.","Yang, Lei; Wang, Jianhui; Hui, Pei; Yarovinsky, Timur O; Badeti, Saiaditya; Pham, Kien; Liu, Chen",Appl. microbiol. biotechnol,,451

Although the aggressive nature of a cancer is a matter of concern, our exact role as oncologists in this time of restricted resources is not fully clarified. Regarding some consensus recommendation for postponing surgery, there is still an essential need for a single approved protocol regarding each type of malignancy. Iran, as one of the first involved countries in this crisis in Asia, which also has a high prevalence of gynecological malignancies, will certainly require an individualized decision-making schedule based on the most accepted global consensus opinion. Considering our restricted health system resources, herein we tried to introduce a logical gynecologic cancer management protocol based on the stage and survival expectancy of each tumor, along with reviewing all recent recommendations. The limited statistics published in this short period of time have obliged us to mainly focus on expert opinions, and the individualized clinical judgments should be agreed upon by multidisciplinary tumor board consensus.

In the context of human cancers, there is evidence that ACE2 might function as a tumor suppressor. The expression levels of ACE2 among the different subtypes of breast cancer has not been investigated. METHODS: We have examined the differential expression of ACE2 and its correlation with prognosis in breast cancer subtypes using the METABRIC (n = 1898) and TCGA (n = 832) cohorts. Correlations were evaluated by Pearsons's correlation co-efficient and Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate differences in disease-free survival between the ACE2 high and ACE2 low groups. RESULTS: There is minimal expression of ACE2 in the luminal classes, but significantly higher levels in the Basal-like and HER2-enriched subclasses. Metastatic biopsies of these tumor types also show enhanced expression of ACE2. High levels of ACE2 correlated with decreased disease-free survival in the HER2-enriched subtype, and it was positively correlated with EGFR expression. CONCLUSION: These observations suggest ACE2 might function as a context dependent factor driving tumor progression in breast cancer and permit new opportunities for targeted therapy.","Nair, Madhumathy G; Prabhu, Jyothi S; Ts, Sridhar",Cancer Treat Res Commun,,451

329015,Detection of respiratory viruses in patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection,2021,"There is no denying the fact that, for a developing country like Bangladesh, the economic consequences of lockdown for containing COVID-19 pandemic can be far reaching affecting livelihoods of millions of households. Given that the share of food consumption expenditure to total expenditure is higher in the lower income groups of Bangladesh, this shock is expected to directly affect affordability of consumption of basic food items of these households. Using nationally representative household survey data of Bangladesh, and while following the Feasible Generalized Least Square method, this paper attempts to examine food poverty, food consumption inequality along with vulnerability to food poverty of households and explores the importance of different socio-demographic and environmental factors in this connection. Our estimation reflects that, greater percentage of households with young children or with elderly people are found to suffer high food vulnerability. In addition, households in environmentally endangered regions e.g. drought prone areas or river erosion affected places are more food vulnerable than those in other parts of the country. Certain occupation groups e.g. day labourer and self-employed are found to be highly vulnerable to food poverty while according to our decomposition analysis of food consumption inequality, area of residence (urban vs. rural) is expected to cause sizable inequality in food consumption. This study can therefore, help in identifying food vulnerable households for government's social protection programs and COVID-19 incentive packages, and thereby can contribute towards designing effective poverty reduction strategies.","Bidisha, Sayema Haque; Mahmood, Tanveer; Hossain, Md Biplob",Soc Indic Res,,451
329016,Detection of respiratory viruses in patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020,"While probabilistic models are an important tool for studying causality, doing so suffers from the intractability of inference. As a step towards tractable causal models, we consider the problem of learning interventional distributions using sum-product networks (SPNs) that are over-parameterized by gate functions, e.g., neural networks. Providing an arbitrarily intervened causal graph as input, effectively subsuming Pearl's do-operator, the gate function predicts the parameters of the SPN. The resulting interventional SPNs are motivated and illustrated by a structural causal model themed around personal health. Our empirical evaluation on three benchmark data sets as well as a synthetic health data set clearly demonstrates that interventional SPNs indeed are both expressive in modelling and flexible in adapting to the interventions.","Zevcevi'c, Matej; Dhami, Devendra Singh; Karanam, Athresh; Natarajan, Sriraam; Kersting, Kristian",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.10440v4.pdf,451

The role of the climate and environment are essential factors to consider in transmission. We explored the association between global meteorological conditions (including mean temperature, wind speed, relative humidity and diurnal temperature range) and new cases of COVID-19 in the whole past year. We assessed the relative risk of meteorological factors to the onset of COVID-19 by using generalized additive models (GAM) and further analyzed the hysteresis effects of meteorological factors using the Distributed Lag Nonlinear Model (DLNM). Our findings revealed that the mean temperature, wind speed and relative humidity were negatively correlated with daily new cases of COVID-19, and the diurnal temperature range was positively correlated with daily new cases of COVID-19. These relationships were more apparent when the temperature and relative humidity were lower than their average value (21.07°Cand 66.83%). The wind speed and diurnal temperature range were higher than the average value(3.07 m/s and 9.53 °C). The maximum RR of mean temperature was 1.30 under -23°C at lag ten days, the minimum RR of wind speed was 0.29 under 12m/s at lag 24 days, the maximum RR of range of temperature was 2.21 under 28 °C at lag 24 days, the maximum RR of relative humidity was 1.35 under 4% at lag 0 days. After a subgroup analysis of the countries included in the study, the results were still robust. As the Northern Hemisphere enters winter, the risk of global covid-19 remains high. Some countries have ushered in a new round of COVID-19 epidemic. Thus, active measures must be taken to control the source of infection, block transmission and prevent further spread of COVID-19 in winter.","Yuan, Jie; Wu, Yu; Jing, Wenzhan; Liu, Jue; Du, Min; Wang, Yaping; Liu, Min",Sci Total Environ,,451

Methods: The tracking of all the close contacts of the first COVID-19 case and epidemiological investigation were conducted on January 29, 2020 after a cluster epidemic of COVID-19 related with a Buddhism rally on January 19 (the 1.19 rally) in Ningbo occurred. The swabs of nose/throat of the cases and close contacts were collected and tested for nucleic acids by real-time fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR. Results: From January 26 to February 20, 2020, a total of 67 COVID-19 cases and 15 asymptomatic infection cases related with the 1.19 rally were reported in Ningbo. The initial case was the infection source who infected 29 second generation cases and 4 asymptomatic infection cases, in whom 23 second generation cases and 3 asymptomatic infection cases once took bus with the initial case, the attack rate was 33.82% (23/68) and the infection rate was 38.24% (26/68). The risks of suffering from COVID-19 and being infected were 28.91 times and 26.01 times higher in rally participants taking bus with initial case compared with those taking no bus with initial case. In this epidemic, 37 third+ generation cases and 11 related asymptomatic infection cases occurred, the attack rate was 2.88% (37/1 283) and the infection rate was 4.76% (48/1 008). The main transmission routes included vehicle sharing and family transmission. Conclusion: It was a cluster epidemic of COVID-19 caused by a super spreader in a massive rally. The epidemic has been under effective control.","Ye, L X; Wang, H B; Lu, H C; Chen, B B; Zhu, Y Y; Gu, S H; Wang, J M; Pan, X X; Fang, T; Dong, H J",Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,,451
333213,SARS-CoV-2 in Germany: Association between deaths and positive rate,2021,"BACKGROUND: Data on the development of Covid-19 among people with intellectual disabilities (IDs) are scarce and it is uncertain to what extent general population data applies to people with ID. To give an indication of possible implications, this study investigated excess mortality patterns during a previous influenza epidemic. METHODS: Using Dutch population and mortality registers, a historical cohort study was designed to compare mortality during the 2017-2018 influenza epidemic with mortality in the same period in the three previous years. People with ID were identified by entitlements to residential ID-care services as retrieved from a national database. RESULTS: Data covered the entire adult Dutch population (12.6 million; GenPop), of which 91 064 individuals were identified with an ID. During the influenza epidemic, mortality among people with ID increased almost three times as much than in the GenPop (15.2% vs. 5.4%), and more among male individuals with ID (+19.5%) than among female individuals with ID (+10.6%), as compared with baseline. In both cohorts, comparable increases in mortality within older age groups and due to respiratory causes were seen. Particularly in the ID-cohort, excess deaths also occurred in younger age groups, due to endocrine diseases and ID-specific causes. CONCLUSIONS: During the 2017-2018 influenza epidemic, excess mortality among people with ID was three times higher than in the general Dutch population, appeared more often at young age and with a broader range of underlying causes. These findings suggest that a pandemic may disproportionally affect people with ID while population data may not immediately raise warnings. Early detection of diverging patterns and faster implementation of tailored strategies therefore require collection of good quality data.","Cuypers, M; Schalk, B W M; Koks-Leensen, M C J; Nägele, M E; Bakker-van Gijssel, E J; Naaldenberg, J; Leusink, G L",J Intellect Disabil Res,,451

We sought to investigate body surface temperatures in feedlot wethers supplemented with ractopamine or zilpaterol and exposed to heat stress for 18 d. Corneal and skin temperatures were assessed via infrared thermography at 1 and 2-m distances. Rectal temperatures and circulating leukocytes, metabolites, and electrolytes were also measured. Heat stress increased (P < 0.05) rectal temperatures in unsupplemented and zilpaterol-supplemented lambs but not in ractopamine-supplemented lambs. Heat stress also increased (P < 0.05) surface temperatures of the cornea, nose, ear, and back, regardless of supplement. Observations were comparable between thermography performed at 1 and 2 m, and higher emissivity settings generally produced less variation. Heat stress tended to increase (P = 0.08) blood monocytes in unsupplemented but not ractopamine or zilpaterol-supplemented lambs. Granulocytes were increased (P < 0.05) by heat stress in ractopamine-supplemented lambs but decreased (P < 0.05) in zilpaterol-supplemented lambs. Blood glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol did not differ among groups, and blood lactate was reduced (P < 0.05) by heat stress in zilpaterol-supplemented lambs only. Blood Na + was reduced (P < 0.05) and Ca 2+ increased (P < 0.05) by heat stress, regardless of supplement. These findings indicate that ß1 and ß2 adrenergic agonists differentially relieve some but not all heat stress-induced changes in stress indicators. Moreover, corneal and skin surface temperatures measured by infrared thermography reasonably identified body temperature changes at a distance of 2 m.","Barnes, Taylor L; Burrack, Rachel M; Schmidt, Ty B; Petersen, Jessica L; Yates, Dustin T",J. anim. sci,,451

This microalga immobilized in alginate beads was previously shown to be useful for the reduction of several chemical and microbial contaminants present in the highly polluted water from the Matanza-Riachuelo watershed. However, these beads had a relatively short shelf life in the natural environment. To overcome this limitation, a 3D-printed PLA device was designed. PLA is a biocompatible and biodegradable material suitable for biotechnological applications. We used Erlenmeyers and stirred-tank bioreactors fed batch with Murashige Skoog (MS) culture medium or water from the Cildáñez stream (one of the water bodies of the aforementioned watershed) to estimate the growth kinetics parameters and the bioremediation capacity of immobilized-microalgal cells as an unconfined system (UcS) or a confined system (CfS) inside PLA devices on Cildáñez water. Although alga's growth parameters were maximum in the UcS fed with MS medium as substrate, successful bioremediation of the target water was possible using the CfS: all inorganic nitrogen forms and total phosphorus were reduced at least by 90% after 5 days of bioprocess in an agitated bioreactor, whereas aerobic mesophilic bacteria decreased by about 85%.

342380,"Intensive care for seriously ill patients affected by novel coronavirus sars - CoV - 2: Experience of the Crema Hospital, Italy",2020,"Biochemical and structural analyses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is well-adapted to infecting humans and the presence of four residues (PRRA) at the S1/S2 site within the spike (S) protein, which may lead to unexpected tissue or host tropism. Here we report that SARS-CoV-2 efficiently utilized ACE2 of 9 species to infect 293T cells. Similarly, pseudoviruses bearing S protein derived from either the bat RaTG13 or pangolin GX, two closely related animal coronaviruses, utilized ACE2 of a diverse range of animal species to gain entry. Removal of PRRA from SARS-CoV-2 S protein displayed distinct effects on pseudoviral entry into different cell types. Unexpectedly, insertion of PRRA into the RaTG13 S protein selectively abrogated the usage of horseshoe bat and pangolin ACE2 but enhanced the usage of mouse ACE2 by the relevant pseudovirus to enter cells. Together, our findings identified a previously unrecognized effect of the PRRA insert on SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 S proteins.ImportanceThe four-residue insert (PRRA) at the boundary between the S1and S2 subunits of SARS-CoV-2 has been widely recognized since day 1 for its role in SARS-CoV-2 S protein processing and activation. As this PRRA insert is unique to SARS-CoV-2 among group b betacoronaviruses, it is thought to affect the tissue and species tropism of SARS-CoV-2. We compared the usage of 10 ACE2 orthologs and found that the presence of PRRA not only affects the cellular tropism of SARS-CoV-2 but also modulates the usage of ACE2 orthologs by the closely related bat RaTG13 S protein. The binding of pseudovirions carrying RaTG13 S with a PRRA insert to mouse ACE2 was nearly 2-fold higher than that of pseudovirions carrying RaTG13 S.","Liu, Shufeng; Selvaraj, Prabhuanand; Lien, Christopher Z; Nunez, Ivette A; Wu, Wells W; Chou, Chao-Kai; Wang, Tony T",J. virol,,451

However, mild bleeding is frequent in patients with B-cell malignancies treated with the irreversible BTKi ibrutinib and the recently approved 2nd generation BTKi acalabrutinib, zanubrutinib and tirabrutinib, and also in volunteers receiving in a phase-1 study the novel irreversible BTKi BI-705564. In contrast, no bleeding has been reported in clinical trials of other BTKi. These include the brain-penetrant irreversible tolebrutinib and evobrutinib (against multiple sclerosis), the irreversible branebrutinib, the reversible BMS-986142 and fenebrutinib (targeting rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematodes), and the reversible covalent rilzabrutinib (against pemphigus and immune thrombocytopenia). Remibrutinib, a novel highly selective covalent BTKi, is currently in clinical studies of autoimmune dermatological disorders. This review describes twelve BTKi approved or in clinical trials. By focusing on their pharmacological properties, targeted disease, bleeding side effects and actions on platelets it attempts to clarify the mechanisms underlying bleeding.

344816,Sex differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates and the potential link to prostate cancer,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has consumed considerable resources and has impacted the delivery of cancer care. Patients with cancer may have factors which place them at high risk for COVID 19 morbidity or mortality. Highly immunosuppressive chemotherapy regimens and possible exposure to COVID-19 during treatment may put patients at additional risk. The Society of Gynecologic Oncology convened an expert panel to address recommendations for best practices during this crisis to minimize risk to patients from deviations in cancer care and from COVID-19 morbidity. METHODS: An expert panel convened to develop initial consensus guidelines regarding anti-neoplastic therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic with respect to gynecologic cancer care and clinical trials. RESULTS: COVID-19 poses special risks to patients who are older, have medical co-morbidities, and cancer. In addition, this pandemic will likely strain resources, making delivery of cancer care or conduct of clinical trials unpredictable. Recommendations are to limit visits and contact with health care facilities by using telemedicine when appropriate, and choosing regimens which require less frequent visits and which are less immunosuppressive. Deviations will occur in clinical trials as a result of limited resources, and it is important to understand regulatory obligations to trial sponsors as well as to the IRB to ensure that clinical trial and patient safety oversight are maintained. CONCLUSIONS: The ongoing crisis will strain resources needed to deliver cancer care. When alterations to the delivery of care are mandated, efforts should be taken to minimize risks and maximize safety while approximating standard practice.","Pothuri, Bhavana; Alvarez Secord, Angeles; Armstrong, Deborah K; Chan, John; Fader, Amanda N; Huh, Warner; Kesterson, Joshua; Liu, Joyce F; Moore, Kathleen; Westin, Shannon N; Naumann, R Wendel",Gynecol Oncol,,451

However, gathering and understanding the content can be difficult due to inaccuracies or inconsistencies between the different sources. To alleviate this challenge in Australia, a team of 48 student volunteers developed an open-source COVID-19 information dashboard to provide accurate, reliable, and real-time COVID-19 information for Australians. The students developed this software while working under legislative restrictions that required social isolation. The goal of this study is to characterize the experiences of the students throughout the project. We conducted an online survey completed by 39 of the volunteering students contributing to the COVID-19 dashboard project. Our results indicate that playing a positive role in the COVID-19 crisis and learning new skills and technologies were the most cited motivating factors for the students to participate in the project. While working on the project, some students struggled to maintain a work-life balance due to working from home. However, the students generally did not express strong sentiment towards general project challenges. The students expressed more strongly that data collection was a significant challenge as it was difficult to collect reliable, accurate, and up-to-date data from various government sources. The students have been able to mitigate these challenges by establishing a systematic data collection process in the team, leveraging frequent and clear communication through text, and appreciating and encouraging each other's efforts. By participating in the project, the students boosted their technical (e.g., front-end development) and non-technical (e.g., task prioritization) skills.

This study aims to estimate the amount of face mask use during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey, thereby expressing our concerns about waste management and plastic pollution and calling on appropriate solid waste management policies and governments to take the necessary measures to formulate their strategies at all levels. In this context, the number of masks in an area of 1 km2 in 3 different cities was determined theoretically and experimentally. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were also used to evaluate plastic polymer characteristics of the single-use face mask. It was determined that the three cities produce roughly 10 tons of face masks in a day. With the increasing use of single-use plastics, the impact of face masks on microplastic pollution is of great concern. Although studies on the recovery of disposable masks continue, the level is insufficient. Therefore, studies to be carried out on technologies that will enable the repeated use of masks are important.","Akarsu, Ceyhun; Madenli, Özgecan; Deveci, Ece Ümmü",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

346970,Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4: A Potential Therapeutic Target in Diabetic Kidney Disease with SARS-CoV-2 Infection,2020,"Dealing with traffic congestion is one of the most pressing challenges for cities. Transport authorities have implemented several strategies to reduce traffic jams with varying degrees of success. The use of reversible lanes is a common approach to improve traffic congestion during rush hours. A reversible lane can change its direction during a time interval to the more congested direction. This strategy can improve traffic congestion in specific scenarios. Most reversible lanes in urban roads are fixed in time and number; however, traffic patterns in cities are highly variable and unpredictable due to this phenomenon's complex nature. Therefore, reversible lanes may not improve traffic flow under certain circumstances; moreover, they could worsen it because of traffic fluctuations. In this paper, we use cellular automata to model adaptive reversible lanes(aka dynamic reversible lanes). Adaptive reversible lanes can change their direction using real-time information to respond to traffic demand fluctuations. Using real traffic data, our model shows that adaptive reversible lanes can improve traffic flow up to 40% compared to conventional reversible lanes. Our results show that there are significant fluctuations in traffic flow even during rush hours, and thus cities would benefit from implementing adaptive reversible lanes.","Pérez-Méndez, Dante; Gershenson, Carlos; Lárraga, María Elena; Mateos, José L",PLoS One,,451

This study aimed to confirm whether anosmia and dysgeusia are specific symptoms among those who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We conducted an age-matched case-control study in the Eastern Townships region of Quebec between Mar. 10 and Mar. 23, 2020. We included adults (age &#8805; 18 yr) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Cases were matched (1:1) according to 5-year age groups with control patents selected randomly from among all patients who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 during the same period. Demographic and laboratory information was collected from medical records. Clinical symptoms and comorbidities associated with anosmia and dysgeusia were obtained by telephone interview with a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: Among 2883 people tested for SARS-CoV-2, we identified 134 positive cases (70 women [52.2%] and 64 men [47.8%]; median age 57.1 [interquartile range 41.2-64.5] yr).

OBJECTIVES: To validate strategies for immune modulation in a preclinical model of viral pneumonia and determine their mechanisms. METHODS: Mice were challenged with the Sendai paramyxovirus in the presence or absence of Pam2-ODN treatment. Virus burden and host immune responses were assessed to elucidate Pam2-ODN mechanisms of action and to identify additional opportunities for therapeutic intervention. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Enhanced survival of Sendai virus pneumonia with Pam2-ODN treatment was associated with reductions in lung virus burden and with virus inactivation prior to internalization. We noted that mortality in sham-treated mice corresponded with CD8+ T cell lung inflammation on days 11-12 after virus challenge, after the viral burden had declined. Pam2-ODN blocked this injurious inflammation by minimizing virus burden. As an alternative intervention, depleting CD8+ T cells 8 days after viral challenge also decreased mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Stimulation of local innate immunity within the lungs by TLR agonists early in disease or suppression of adaptive immunity by systemic CD8+ T cell depletion late in disease improves outcomes of viral pneumonia in mice. These data reveal opportunities for targeted immunomodulation to protect susceptible human subjects.","Wali, Shradha; Flores, Jose R; Jaramillo, Ana Maria; Goldblatt, David L; Pantaleón García, Jezreel; Tuvim, Michael J; Dickey, Burton F; Evans, Scott E",Am. j. respir. cell mol. biol,,451

352777,Impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic on the Mental Health of the Elderly,2020,"BACKGROUND: One hundred days after SARS-CoV-2 was first reported in Vietnam on January 23rd, 270 cases were confirmed, with no deaths. We describe the control measures used by the Government and their relationship with imported and domestically-acquired case numbers, with the aim of identifying the measures associated with successful SARS-CoV-2 control. METHODS: Clinical and demographic data on the first 270 SARS-CoV-2 infected cases and the timing and nature of Government control measures, including numbers of tests and quarantined individuals, were analysed. Apple and Google mobility data provided proxies for population movement. Serial intervals were calculated from 33 infector-infectee pairs and used to estimate the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission events and time-varying reproduction numbers. RESULTS: A national lockdown was implemented between April 1st and 22nd. Around 200 000 people were quarantined and 266 122 RT-PCR tests conducted. Population mobility decreased progressively before lockdown. 60% (163/270) of cases were imported; 43% (89/208) of resolved infections remained asymptomatic for the duration of infection. The serial interval was 3·24 days, and 27·5% (95% confidence interval, 15·7%-40·0%) of transmissions occurred pre-symptomatically. Limited transmission amounted to a maximum reproduction number of 1·15 (95% confidence interval, 0·37-2·36). No community transmission has been detected since April 15th. CONCLUSIONS: Vietnam has controlled SARS-CoV-2 spread through the early introduction of mass communication, meticulous contact-tracing with strict quarantine, and international travel restrictions. The value of these interventions is supported by the high proportion of asymptomatic and imported cases, and evidence for substantial pre-symptomatic transmission.","Pham, Quang Thai; Rabaa, Maia A; Duong, Huy Luong; Dang, Quang Tan; Tran, Dai Quang; Quach, Ha-Linh; Hoang, Ngoc-Anh Thi; Phung, Cong Dinh; Ngu, Duy Nghia; Tran, Anh Tu; La, Ngoc Quang; Tran, My Phuc; Vinh, Chau; Nguyen, Cong Khanh; Dang, Duc Anh; Tran, Nhu Duong; Thwaites, Guy; van Doorn, H Rogier; Choisy, Marc",Clin. infect. dis,,451

Most of the search engines currently available on the web, including all social media platforms, are black-boxes (a.k.a opaque) supporting short keyword queries. In these settings, retrieving all posts and comments discussing a particular news item automatically and at large scales is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a method for generating short keyword queries given a prototype document. The proposed algorithm interacts with the opaque search engine to iteratively improve the query. It is evaluated on the Twitter TREC Microblog 2012 and TREC-COVID 2019 datasets showing superior performance compared to state of the art and is applied to automatically collect large scale dataset for training machine learning classifiers for fake news detection. The classifiers training on 70,000 labeled news items and more than 61 million associated tweets automatically collected using the proposed method obtained impressive performance of AUC and accuracy of 0.92, and 0.86, respectively.","Elyashar, Aviad; Reuben, Maor; Puzis, Rami",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.12498v1.pdf,451

354893,The relationship between blood groups and risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 or development of severe outcomes: A review,2021,"Halo blight disease of beans is caused by a Gram-negative bacterium, Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola (Pph). The disease is prevalent in South America and Africa and causes crop loss to indigent people who rely on beans as a primary source of daily nutrition. In susceptible beans, Pph causes water-soaking at the site of infection and produces phaseolotoxin, an inhibitor of bean arginine biosynthesis. In resistant beans, Pph triggers a hypersensitive response that limits the spread of infection. Here, we used high-throughput mass spectrometry to interrogate the responses to two different Pph isolates on a single line of common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris PI G19833 with a reference genome sequence. We obtained quantitative information for 4,135 bean proteins. A subset of 160 proteins with similar accumulation changes during both susceptible and resistant reactions included salicylic acid responders EDS1 and NDR1, ethylene and jasmonic acid biosynthesis enzymes, and proteins enabling vesicle secretion. These proteins revealed the activation of a basal defense involving hormonal responses and the mobilization of extracellular proteins. A subset of 29 proteins specific to hypersensitive immunity included SOBIR1, a G-type lectin-receptor-like kinase, and enzymes needed for glucoside and phytoalexin production. Virus-induced gene silencing revealed that the G-type lectin-receptor-like kinase suppresses bacterial infection. Together, the results define the proteomics of disease resistance to Pph in beans and support a model whereby the induction of hypersensitive immunity reinstates defenses targeted by Pph.","Cooper, Bret; Campbell, Kimberly B; Beard, Hunter; Garrett, Wesley M; Ferreira, Marcio E",Mol. plant-microb. interact,,451
354894,The relationship between blood groups and risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 or development of severe outcomes: A review,2021,"The current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been defined as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. We aimed to evaluate the clinical features and virological course of non-severe COVID-19 patients with or without symptoms who were admitted to a Chinese cabin hospital. In this retrospective single center study, we reviewed 252 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients treated at one temporary cabin hospital in Wuhan, China. Demographic, clinical, serial chest computed tomography (CT), and serial viral test data were compared between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. The association between clinical features and symptomatic status or patient referral status was analyzed. Among all 252 patients, 74 (29.4%) were asymptomatic and 138 (54.76%) had more than two family members who developed COVID-19. The probability for family clustering was similar between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients (59.70 vs. 61.64%, P = 0.79). Asymptomatic patients and symptomatic patients were equally likely to reach a virus-free state during their stay at the cabin hospital (93.15 vs. 86.44%, P = 0.13). The initial chest CT screening showed that 81 (32.1%) patients had no visible pneumonia, 52 (20.6%) had unilateral pneumonia, and 119 (47.2%) had bilateral pneumonia. Symptomatic patients had a higher chance to have bilateral pneumonia (P &lt; 0.0001) and were less likely to show improvement on the follow-up CT scan (P = 0.0002). In total, 69 (27.4%) patients were referred to the designated hospital and only 23 (9.1%) patients were referred due to the progression of pneumonia. Non-severe COVID-19 patients can transmit the disease regardless of their symptomatic status. It is highly recommended that asymptomatic patients be identified and quarantined to eliminate the transmission of COVID-19.","Li, Yanli; Shi, Jie; Xia, Jianbo; Duan, Jie; Chen, Lijuan; Yu, Xudong; Lan, Weishun; Ma, Quanfu; Wu, Xufeng; Yuan, Yichong; Gong, Liyan; Yang, Xinghai; Gao, Han; Wu, Chunchen",Front.

Our focus is on the implications for nurses, who are the largest global health care workforce but whose perspectives are not always fully considered. This essay discusses three overarching ethical issues that create a myriad of concerns and will likely affect nurses globally in unique ways: the safety of nurses, patients, colleagues, and families; the allocation of scarce resources; and the changing nature of nurses' relationships with patients and families. We urge policy-makers to ensure that nurses' voices and perspectives are integrated into both local and global decision-making so as to minimize the structural injustices many nurses have faced to date.

358762,Identification of the RNase-binding site of SARS-CoV-2 RNA for anchor primer-PCR detection of viral loading in 306 COVID-19 patients,2020,"BACKGROUND: Few adolescents achieve sufficient levels of physical activity, and many are spending most of their time in sedentary behavior. Affective response following sedentary time may influence motivation to remain sedentary. Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is a real-time data capture methodology that can be used to identify factors influencing sedentary time, such as the context of the home setting, and resulting affective state within a free-living setting. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between context at home and adolescent sedentary time, and the relationship of sedentary time and subsequent affect. METHODS: Adolescents (n = 284; 10-16 y) participated in an EMA study that used random, interval-based sampling methods. Adolescents each received 22 unannounced surveys over 7-days through a smartphone application. One survey was randomly sent within each 2-h time-period. These time-periods occurred between 4:00 pm-8:00 pm on weekdays and 8:00 am-8:00 pm on the weekend. This 15-question survey included a series of questions on context (indoors/outdoors, alone/not alone) and positive affect. Adolescents concurrently wore an accelerometer at the hip, and the 30-min bout of accelerometry data prior to each survey was used in analyses. Mixed-effect location scale models were used to examine the association between context at home and sedentary time (stage 1) and the adjusted sedentary time and positive affect (stage 2), with each model adjusted for covariates. RESULTS: Adolescents were 12.6 ± 1.9 y of age on average, about half were White (58%), and engaged in high levels of sedentary behavior during the 30 min prior to the survey (21.4 ± 6.8 min). Most surveys occurred when adolescents were with others (59%) and indoors (88%). In Stage 1, both being alone and being indoors at home were positively associated with sedentary time (p < 0.001 for both). In Stage 2, adjusted sedentary time was not related to positive affect. Age was negatively related to positive affect (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Both contextual factors, being alone and indoors at home, were related to additional time spent sedentary compared to being with someone or outdoors. After adjustment, sedentary time was not related to subsequent positive affect, indicating other factors may be related to adolescent's positive affect in home settings.","Kracht, Chelsea L; Beyl, Robbie A; Maher, Jaclyn P; Katzmarzyk, Peter T; Staiano, Amanda E",Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act,,451

Sacco Hospital (Milano, Italy) on 20th February 2020 in a 38 years old male patient, who was found positive for pneumonia at the Codogno Hospital. Thereafter Lombardy has reported the highest prevalence of COVID-19 cases in the country, especially in Milano, Brescia and Bergamo provinces. The aim of this study was to assess the potential presence of different viral clusters belonging to the six main provinces involved in Lombardy COVID-19 cases in order to highlight peculiar province-dependent viral characteristics. A phylogenetic analysis was conducted on 20 full length genomes obtained from patients addressing to several Lombard hospitals from February 20th to April 4th, 2020, aligned with 41 Italian viral genome assemblies available on GISAID database as of 30th March, 2020: two main monophyletic clades, containing 8 and 53 isolates, respectively, were identified. Noteworthy, Bergamo isolates mapped inside the small clade harbouring M gene D3G mutation. The molecular clock analysis estimated a cluster divergence approximately one month before the first patient identification, supporting the hypothesis that different SARS-CoV-2 strains had spread worldwide at different times, but their presence became evident only in late February along with Italian epidemic emergence. Therefore, this epidemiological reconstruction suggests that virus initial circulation in Lombardy was ascribable to multiple introduction. The phylogenetic reconstruction robustness, however, will be improved when more genomic sequences are available, in order to guarantee a complete epidemiological surveillance.","Micheli, Valeria; Rimoldi, Sara G; Romeri, Francesca; Comandatore, Francesco; Mancon, Alessandro; Gigantiello, Anna; Perini, Matteo; Mileto, Davide; Pagani, Cristina; Lombardi, Alessandra; Gismondo, Maria R",J. med. virol,,451

METHODS: The 2012-2015 Nationwide Inpatient Sample was queried for all patients undergoing surgical resection of malignant brain tumors. These patients were then grouped by the presence of concurrent diagnosis of hyponatremia, and compared with respect to various clinical features, peri- and postoperative complications, all-cause mortality, discharge disposition, length of stay, and hospitalization costs. Propensity score matching was utilized to control for appropriate baseline confounders and the influence of other endpoint variables. RESULTS: The search criteria identified 12,480 adult patients admitted for malignant brain tumor resection, of whom 1,162 (9.3%) developed hyponatremia in the perioperative period. Patients with obstructive hydrocephalus (RR = 1.23, P<0.001), diabetes (RR = 1.14, P=0.014), hypertension (RR = 1.15, P<0.001), and depression (RR = 1.24, P<0.002) were more likely to develop hyponatremia. Tumor location was not associated with risk of developing hyponatremia. Patients with hyponatremia were more likely to require ventriculostomy (RR = 1.23, P<0.001), ventriculoperitoneal shunt (RR = 1.34, P<0.001), and lumbar puncture (RR = 1.25, P<0.001), and were also more likely to be discharged to short-term hospital (RR = 1.25, P<0.001) or rehabilitation (RR = 1.21, P<0.001), as well as have longer hospital stay (P<0.001) and increased hospital charges (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with obstructive hydrocephalus, diabetes, hypertension, and depression were more likely to develop perioperative hyponatremia. Hyponatremia was associated with increased morbidity following malignant brain tumor resection.","Patel, Saavan; Chiu, Ryan G; Rosinski, Clayton L; Chaker, Anisse N; Burch, Taylor G; Behbahani, Mandana; Sadeh, Morteza; Mehta, Ankit I",World neurosurgery (Online),,451

364758,The initial impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on epilepsy research,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has altered life globally like no other event in modern history, and psychological service changes to meet the resultant impacts on families have not been assessed in the empirical literature. The purpose of the current study was to examine whether family systems therapists increased their teletherapy use during the pandemic relative to prepandemic usage, and whether projected postpandemic rates would remain at the same level; further, environmental and demographic predictors of these changes were examined. In May 2020, a sample of 626 family systems therapists (58.6% women, 40.6% men; M = 57.4 years old; M years in practice = 25.5) completed a national online study assessing these variables. Results suggested that family systems therapists performed 7.92% of their clinical work using teletherapy before the pandemic and 88.17% during the pandemic. They also projected that they would perform 36.57% of their clinical work using teletherapy after the pandemic. Teletherapy uptake was unrelated to primary practice setting, provider age, gender, race/ethnicity, and practice location (urban/suburban vs. rural) but was higher for family systems therapists who reported increased supportive teletherapy policies and training in their practice setting. Organizational infrastructure and availability of training played an important role in influencing teletherapy uptake during the pandemic. Family systems therapists have a unique opportunity to deploy teletherapy modalities to meet the needs of families during the COVID-19 pandemic, and infrastructure and training to do so may facilitate that work.","McKee, Grace B; Pierce, Bradford S; Tyler, Carmen M; Perrin, Paul B; Elliott, Timothy R",Fam. process,,451

There is paucity of data on the association between EIH and angiotensin II in well-trained middle-aged marathoners. Therefore, we investigated the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system and total nitric oxide activity in middle-aged marathoners with EIH.Seventy middle-aged marathoners were divided into 3 groups: normal blood pressure ([NBPG] [nâ=â21]), EIH group ([EIHG] [nâ=â35]), and complex hypertension group ([CHG] [nâ=â14]). We defined NBPG as resting systolic BP/diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) of &#8804;140/90 mm Hg and maximal exercise SBP of &#8804;210 mm Hg, EIHG as resting SBP/DBP &#8804;140/90 mm Hg and maximal exercise SBP of &#8805;210 mm Hg, and CHG as resting SBP/DBP &#8805;140/90 mm Hg and maximal exercise SBP of &#8805;210 mm Hg. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system and NO levels were measured before and 30 minutes after the graded exercise test.Renin level was elevated while angiotensin level was reduced after 30 minutes of graded exercise test. There was no change in angiotensin I and angiotensin converting enzyme levels. Comparing the groups, renin level was only elevated in the CHG during recovery, while aldosterone level was higher than the baseline level in the recovery phase in all groups. Angiotensin I level remained unchanged in all groups. Angiotensin II level reduced significantly in the NBPG group but remained at the baseline in the EIHG and CHG groups. NO level was unchanged in the NBPG group but reduced in the EIHG and CHG groups after exercise. At 3âminutes of recovery, SBP was the highest in the NBPG group, followed by the EIHG and CHG groups (Pâ<â.05).In conclusion, angiotensin II activity and reduced NO level are associated with EIH in middle-aged long-distance runners. Angiotensin II inhibitors may; therefore, be the more appropriate antihypertensive medication for runners with EIH.","Kim, Chul-Hyun; Park, Yongbum; Chun, Min Young; Kim, Young-Joo",Medicine (Baltimore),,451

Currently, extensive research and development efforts are aimed at producing a safe and effective vaccine. In the interim, small molecules are being widely investigated for antiviral effects. With respect to viral replication, the papain-like (PLpro) and main proteases (Mpro), are critical for processing viral replicase polypeptides. Further, the PLpro possesses deubiquitinating activity affecting key signalling pathways, including inhibition of interferon and innate immune antagonism. Therefore, inhibition of PLpro activity with small molecules is an important research direction. Our aim was to focus on identification of potential inhibitors of the protease activity of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. We investigated 300 small compounds derived predominantly from our OliveNet&#8482; library (222 phenolics) and supplemented with synthetic and dietary compounds with reported antiviral activities. An initial docking screen, using the potent and selective noncovalent PLpro inhibitor, GRL-0617 as a control, enabled a selection of 30 compounds for further analyses. From further in silico analyses, including docking to scenes derived from a publicly available molecular dynamics simulation trajectory (100 µs PDB 6WX4; DESRES-ANTON-11441075), we identified lead compounds for further in vitro evaluation using an enzymatic inhibition assay measuring SARS-CoV-2 PLpro protease activity. Our findings indicate that hypericin possessed inhibition activity, and both rutin and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of the PLpro, with activity in the micromolar range. Overall, hypericin, rutin, and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside can be considered lead compounds requiring further characterisation for potential antiviral effects in appropriate model systems.","Pitsillou, Eleni; Liang, Julia; Ververis, Katherine; Hung, Andrew; Karagiannis, Tom C",J Mol Graph Model,,451

368099,Longitudinal Isolation of Potent Near-Germline SARS-CoV-2-Neutralizing Antibodies from COVID-19 Patients,2020,"Background Influenza infection causes considerable morbidity and mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease. We assessed the effects of the influenza vaccine on mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease. Methods and Results We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library through January 2020 for randomized controlled trials and observational studies assessing the effects of influenza vaccine on mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease. Estimates were reported as random effects risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs. Analyses were stratified by study design into randomized controlled trials and observational studies. A total of 16 studies (n=237 058), including 4 randomized controlled trials (n=1667) and 12 observational studies (n=235 391), were identified. Participants' mean age was 69.2±7.01 years, 36.6% were women, 65.1% had hypertension, 31.1% had diabetes mellitus, and 23.4% were smokers. At a median follow-up duration of 19.5 months, influenza vaccine was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.60-0.93 [P=0.01]), cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.80-0.84 [P<0.001]), and major adverse cardiovascular events (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80-0.94 [P<0.001]) compared with control. The use of the influenza vaccine was not associated with a statistically significant reduction of myocardial infarction (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.49-1.09 [P=0.12]) compared with control. Conclusions Data from both randomized controlled trials and observational studies support the use of the influenza vaccine in adults with cardiovascular disease to reduce mortality and cardiovascular events, as currently supported by clinical guidelines. Clinicians and health systems should continue to promote the influenza vaccine as part of comprehensive secondary prevention.","Yedlapati, Siva H; Khan, Safi U; Talluri, Swapna; Lone, Ahmed N; Khan, Muhammad Zia; Khan, Muhammad Shahzeb; Navar, Ann M; Gulati, Martha; Johnson, Heather; Baum, Seth; Michos, Erin D",J Am Heart Assoc,,451

Such loss could be prevented if there were a serologic assay for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies for serological surveillance of its infection at the early stage of disease. METHODS: Using Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cell-expressed full-length SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein as capturing antigen, a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)/SARS-CoV-2 S1 serology enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit was developed and validated with negative samples collected prior to the outbreak or during the outbreak and positive samples from patients confirmed with COVID-19. RESULTS: The specificity of the ELISA kit was 97.5%, as examined against total 412 normal human samples. The sensitivity was 97.1% by testing against 69 samples from hospitalized and/or recovered COVID-19 patients. The overall accuracy rate reached 97.3%. The assay was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibody on day 1 after the onset of COVID-19 disease. The average antibody levels increased during hospitalization and 14 days after discharge.

We estimate the cause-specific excess mortality during the complete circle of COVID-19 outbreak in Guangzhou, China, stratified by sociodemographic status. METHODS: Guangzhou Center for Disease Control Prevention provided the individual data of deaths in Guangzhou from 1 January 2018 through 30 June 2020. We applied Poisson regression models to daily cause-specific mortality between 1 January 2018 and 20 January 2020, accounting for effects of population size, calendar time, holiday, ambient temperature and PM2.5. Expected mortality was estimated for the period from 21 January through 30 June 2020 assuming that the effects of factors aforementioned remained the same as described in the models. Excess mortality was defined as the difference between the observed mortality and the expected mortality. Subgroup analyses were performed by place of death, age group, sex, marital status and occupation class. RESULTS: From 21 January (the date on which the first COVID-19 case occurred in Guangzhou) through 30 June 2020, there were three stages of COVID-19: first wave, second wave, and recovery stage, starting on 21 January, 11 March, and 17 May 2020, respectively.

In some patients, disease progression leads to an enormous secretion of cytokines, known as cytokine storm, among those cytokines IL-6 plays an important role. Here the author shows how IL-6 has both pro and anti-inflammatory properties, depending on the pathway of transduction: soluble (trans-signaling) or membrane-related (classic signaling), and suggests how targeting only the pro-inflammatory pathway, with SGP130Fc, could be a better option then targeting them both. Other possible IL-6 pathway inhibitors such as Ruxolitinib and Baricinitib are then analyzed, underlying how they lack the benefit of targeting only the pro-inflammatory pathway.","Magro, Giuseppe",Cytokine X,,451
370689,[Use of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection test in nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19 infection control],2020,"Background: The molecular interactions between viral proteins form the basis of virus production and can be used to develop strategies against virus infection. The interactions of the envelope proteins and the viral RNA-binding nucleocapsid (N) protein are essential for the assembly of coronaviruses including the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Methods: Using co-immunoprecipitation, immunostaining, and proteomics analysis, we identified a protein interacting with the spike (S) protein in the cells infected with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. To confirm the interaction, synthetic peptides corresponding to the C-terminal domain of the S protein (Spike CD) were produced and their effect on the interaction was investigated in vitro. In vivo effect of the Spike CD peptides after cell penetration was further investigated using viral plaque formation assay. Phylogeographic analyses were conducted to deduce homology of Spike CDs and N proteins. Results: We identified a direct interaction between the S protein and the N protein of MERS-CoV that takes place during virus assembly in infected cells. Spike CD peptides of MERS-CoV inhibited the interaction between the S and N proteins in vitro. Furthermore, cell penetration by the synthetic Spike CD peptides inhibited viral plaque formation in MERS-CoV-infected cells. Phylogeographic analyses of Spike CDs and N proteins showed high homology among betacoronavirus lineage C strains. To determine if Spike CD peptides can inhibit the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), we used the same strategy and found that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike CD peptide inhibited virus replication in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Conclusions: We suggest that the interaction between the S protein and the N protein can be targeted to design new therapeutics against emerging coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.","Park, Byoung Kwon; Kim, Jinsoo; Park, Sangkyu; Kim, Dongbum; Kim, Minyoung; Baek, Kyeongbin; Bae, Joon-Yong; Park, Man-Seong; Kim, Won-Keun; Lee, Younghee; Kwon, Hyung-Joo",Theranostics,,451

Our aim was to detect, by serology, previous SARS-CoV-2 contact in SpA, compared to health care workers (HCW), and healthy controls. Methods: Sera from consecutive patients affected by SpA undergoing cytokine-targeted therapy, HCW and healthy controls from 2015 were analysed through chemiluminescent analytical system for the presence of IgG and IgM anti-SARS-CoV-2. Positive patients (IgM or IgG, or both) additionally underwent real-time Polymerase-Chain-Reaction (RT-PCR) to test for active infection. Serology was repeated at 3-months in SpA. Data across 3 groups were compared by Kruskal Wallis/Chi-square, and between 2 groups by Wilcoxon rank test/Chi-Square. P &#8804; 0.05 were considered significant. Results: 200 SpA, 95 HCW and 101 controls were recruited. Positive serology was found in 25(12.5%) SpA, 8(8.4%) HCW, 0(0%) controls (p=0.001). SpA patients with positive serology more frequently reported COVID-19-like symptoms than those with negative serology (20% vs. 4%, p=0.009) and 2 had COVID-19 as confirmed by RT-PCR, non severe. No HCW reported symptoms or had positive RT-PCR. In SpA patients, at 3 months, mean IgM titres decreased from 2.76 ± 2.93 to 2.38 ± 2.95 (p=0.001), while IgG titres from 0.89 ± 3.25 to 0.31 ± 0.87 (p=ns). Conclusions: Serology revealed that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in SpA patients and HCW was higher than expected based on reported symptoms. In SpA, anti-cytokine therapy could act as a protective factor for a severe disease course. However, a seroconversion was not observed at 3-months.","Ortolan, Augusta; Lorenzin, Mariagrazia; Cosma, Chiara; Cozzi, Giacomo; Padoan, Andrea; Doria, Andrea; Plebani, Mario; Ramonda, Roberta",Front Immunol,,451
372965,Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor: molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic target,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has put much of the world into lockdown, as one unintended upside to this response, the air quality has been widely reported to have improved worldwide. Existing studies examine the environmental effect of lockdowns at a city- or country-level, few examines it from a global perspective. Using a novel COVID-19 government response tracker dataset, combining the daily air pollution data and weather data across 597 major cities worldwide between January 1, 2020, and July 5, 2020, this study quantifies the causal impacts of 8 types of lockdown measures on changes of a range of individual pollutants based on a difference-in-differences design. The results show that the NO2 air quality index value falls more precipitously (23-37%) relative to the pre-lockdown period, followed by PM10 (14-20%), SO2 (2-20%), PM2.5 (7-16%), and CO (7-11%), but the O3 increases 10-27%. Furthermore, intra/intercity travel restrictions have a better performance in curbing air pollution. These results are robust to a set of alternative specifications, including different panel sizes, independent variables, estimation strategies. The heterogeneity analysis in terms of different types of cities shows that the lockdown effects are more remarkable in cities from lower-income, more industrialized, and populous countries. We also do a back-of-the-envelope calculation of the subsequent health benefits following such improvement, and the expected averted premature deaths due to air pollution declines are around 99,270 to 146,649 among 76 countries and regions involved in this study during the COVID-19 lockdown. These findings underscore the importance of continuous air pollution control strategies to protect human health and reduce the associated social welfare loss both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Liu, Feng; Wang, Meichang; Zheng, Meina",Sci Total Environ,,451

Exposure sources and demographic factors vary by location and can therefore have a major impact on salmonellosis clustering. We evaluated major NTS serotypes: S. Enteritidis (n = 620), S. Typhimurium (n = 150), S. Thompson (n = 138), and S. Heidelberg (n = 136) reported in the city of Toronto, Canada, between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2017. Cases were analyzed at the forward sortation area (FSA)-level (an area indicated by the first three characters of the postal code). Serotype-specific global and local clustering of infections were evaluated using the Moran's I method. Spatial and space-time clusters were investigated using Poisson and multinomial scan statistic models. Case-case analyses using a multinomial logistic regression model was conducted to compare seasonal and demographic factors among the different serotypes. High infection rate FSAs clustered in the central region of Toronto for S. Enteritidis, in the south-central region for S. Typhimurium, in north-west region for S. Thompson, and in the south-east region for S. Heidelberg. The relative risk ratio of S. Enteritidis infections was significantly higher in cases who reported travel outside of Ontario. The relative risk ratio of infections was significantly higher in summer for S. Typhimurium, and in fall for S. Thompson. The relative risk ratio of infection was highest for the 0-9 age group for S. Typhimurium, and the 20-39 age group for S. Heidelberg.

373549,SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: clinical picture of COVID-19 and implications for research,2020,"Patients with cancer are at an increased risk to suffer severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Therefore, specific preventative measures including COVID-19 vaccines are especially important. Both anticancer therapies and the underlying malignancy itself can lead to significant immunosuppression posing a particular challenge for vaccination strategies in these patients. At the moment, four COVID-19 vaccines are European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved in Germany: two mRNA and two viral vector-based vaccines. All four vaccines show excellent protection against severe COVID-19. Their mechanism of action relies on the induction of the production of virus-specific proteins by human cells and the following activation of a specific adaptive immune response. Vaccination against COVID-19 has been prioritized for cancer patients and medical personnel in Germany. Regarding timing of vaccination, vaccination prior to initiation of anticancer therapy seems ideal in newly diagnosed disease. However, due to the significant risk of severe COVID-19 in cancer patients, vaccination is also strongly recommended for patients already undergoing anticancer therapy. In these patients, immune response might be reduced. In two particular patient cohorts, namely stem cell transplant recipients and patients treated with B­cell depleting agents, an interval of several months following therapy is recommended because otherwise the response to vaccination will most likely be severely reduced. Preliminary data suggest only low rates of seroconversion following a single shot of vaccine in cancer patients. Therefore, on the long run, repeat vaccination regimens might be preferable in cancer patients.","von Lilienfeld-Toal, Marie; Rieger, Christina; Giesen, Nicola; Wörmann, Bernhard",Onkologe (Berl),,451

The study aims to report a case of a female patient with severe CCHF with pulmonary embolism. CASE REPORT: A 61-year-old woman admitted to the emergency department with complaints of high fever, nausea, and weakness. The patient was dealing with animal husbandry and had a tick bite history. At laboratory findings, bicytopenia, abnormal liver function tests, and elevated coagulation parameters were observed. Real-time plymerase chain reaction confirmed the diagnosis of CCHF. Three sessions of plasmapheresis were performed due to continued fever and worsening in laboratory values. Pulmonary embolism was detected in computerized thorax tomography carried out due to respiratory alkalosis on the 6th day. She was successfully treated with supportive and anticoagulation therapy. CONCLUSION: CCHF demonstrates different types of clinical presentations apart from fever and hemorrhage.

Billions of people around the world are asked to adhere to strict shelter-in-place rules, finalised to slow down the spread of the virus. Appeals and messages are being used by leaders and policy-makers to promote pandemic response. Given the stakes at play, it is thus important for social scientists to explore which messages are most effective in promoting pandemic response. In fact, some papers in the last month have explored the effect of several messages on people's intentions to engage in pandemic response behaviour. In this paper, we make two contributions. First, we explore the effect of messages on people's actual engagement, and not on intentions. Specifically, our dependent variables are the level of understanding of official COVID-19 pandemic response governmental informative panels, measured through comprehension questions, and the time spent on reading these rules. Second, we test a novel set of appeals built through the theory of norms. One message targets the personal norm (what people think is the right thing to do), one targets the descriptive norm (what people think others are doing), and one targets the injunctive norm (what people think others approve or disapprove of). Our experiment is conducted online with a representative (with respect to gender, age, and location) sample of Italians. Norms are made salient using a flier. We find that norm-based fliers had no effect on comprehension and on time spent on the panels. These results suggest that norm-based interventions through fliers have very little impact on people's reading and understanding of COVID-19 pandemic response governmental rules.","Bilancini, Ennio; Boncinelli, Leonardo; Capraro, Valerio; Celadin, Tatiana; Paolo, Roberto Di",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.03998v2.pdf,451

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional prospective study was conducted in tertiary hospitals in the Uusimaa region, Finland, with 1072 volunteers being enrolled in the study from among the HCWs at the Helsinki University Hospital. Overall, 866 (80.8%) HCWs (including 588 nurses, 170 doctors, and 108 laboratory and medical imaging nurses) completed the questionnaire by July 15, 2020, with 52% of the participants taking care of COVID­19 patients. The participants answered a structured questionnaire regarding their use of PPE, the ability to follow safety guidelines, exposure to COVID­19, and the source of potential COVID­19 infections. The participants with COVID­19 symptoms were tested with the SARS-CoV-2 realtime polymerase chain reaction method. All infected participants were contacted, and their answers were confirmed regarding COVID­19 exposure. RESULTS: In total, 41 (4.7%) participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, with 22 (53.6%) of infections being confirmed or likely occupational, and 12 (29.3%) originating from colleagues. In 14 cases (63.6%), occupational infections occurred while using a surgical mask, and all infections originating from patients occurred while using a surgical mask or no mask at all. No occupational infections were found while using an FFP2/3 respirator and following aerosol precautions. The combined odds ratio for working at an intensive care unit, an emergency department, or a ward was 3.4 (95% CI: 1.2-9.2, p = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: A high infection rate was found among HCWs despite safety guidelines. Based on these findings, the authors recommend the use of FFP2/3 respirators in all patient contacts with confirmed or suspected COVID­19, along with the use of universal masking, also in personnel rooms.

379256,The diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 pneumonia: A review of laboratory and radiological testing results,2020,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, has been estimated using imported case counts of international travellers, generally under the assumptions that all cases of the disease in travellers have been ascertained and that infection prevalence in travellers and residents is the same. However, findings indicate variation among locations in the capacity for detection of imported cases. Singapore has had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact tracing capacity during previous infectious disease outbreaks and has consistently shown high sensitivity of case-detection during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: We used a Bayesian modelling approach to estimate the relative capacity for detection of imported cases of COVID-19 for 194 locations (excluding China) compared with that for Singapore. We also built a simple mathematical model of the point prevalence of infection in visitors to an epicentre relative to that in residents. FINDINGS: The weighted global ability to detect Wuhan-to-location imported cases of COVID-19 was estimated to be 38% (95% highest posterior density interval [HPDI] 22-64) of Singapore's capacity. This value is equivalent to 2·8 (95% HPDI 1·5-4·4) times the current number of imported and reported cases that could have been detected if all locations had had the same detection capacity as Singapore. Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify likely case-detection capacities, the ability to detect imported cases relative to Singapore was 40% (95% HPDI 22-67) among locations with high surveillance capacity, 37% (18-68) among locations with medium surveillance capacity, and 11% (0-42) among locations with low surveillance capacity. Treating all travellers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travellers in Wuhan) contributed modestly to underestimation of prevalence. INTERPRETATION: Estimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of 100% detection in travellers could have been underestimated by several fold. Furthermore, severity estimates will be inflated several fold since they also rely on case count estimates. Finally, our model supports evidence that underdetected cases of COVID-19 have probably spread in most locations around the world, with greatest risk in locations of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicentre of the outbreak.

DESIGN: Students' familiarity with online learning modes and corresponding perceived usefulness (PU) according to their previous experiences were investigated using an online survey. The survey also collected data on students' perceptions through their evaluation of and satisfaction with current online learning. SETTING: In response to the educational challenges created by COVID-19, medical schools in China have adopted formal online courses for students. PARTICIPANTS: The questionnaire was sent to 225 329 students, of whom 52.38% (118 080/225 329) replied, with valid data available for 44.18% (99 559/225 329). METHODS: Pearson correlations and t-tests were used to examine the relationship between familiarity and PU. Multiple linear regression and logistic regression analyses were used to determine the impact of prior learning experiences and its interactions with gender, area, learning phase and academic performance on students' perceptions. RESULTS: Students' PU had a significant positive correlation with their familiarity with online learning modes (p<0.01). Students' evaluation of and satisfaction with their current online education were positively associated with their familiarity (ß=0.46, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.48, p<0.01; OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.14, p<0.01) with and PU (ß=3.11, 95% CI 2.92 to 3.30, p<0.01; OR 2.55, 95% CI 2.37 to 2.75, p<0.01) of online learning. Moreover, the higher the students' learning phases, the lower the associations between PU and students' evaluation of and satisfaction with ongoing online education. CONCLUSIONS: Medical students in China have experiences with various online learning modes. Prior learning experiences are positively associated with students' evaluation of and satisfaction with current online education.

Those most isolated or at risk of abuse may have experienced a double confinement. How to identify and respond to the needs of people already in vulnerable situations before confinement, who, isolated in the epidemic context, have seen their vulnerabilities increase? While new ways of working have been introduced in times of containment, some were interesting, others have shown their limits.

METHODS: In order to find studies evaluating the COVID-19 virus epidemiology, repurposed drugs and potential vaccines, web searches and bibliographical bases have been used with keywords that matches the content of this review. RESULTS: The published results of SARS-CoV-2 structures and interactomics have been used to identify potential therapeutic candidates. We illustrate recent publications on SARS-CoV-2, concerning its molecular, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics, and focus on innovative diagnostics technologies in the production pipeline. This objective of this review is to enhance the comprehension of the unique characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and strengthen future control measures. Lay Summary: An innovative analysis is evaluating the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim is to increase knowledge of possible viral detection methods, which highlights several new technology limitations and advantages. We have assessed some drugs currently for patients (Lopinavir, Ritonavir, Anakinra and Interferon beta 1a), as the feasibility of COVID-19 specific antivirals is not presently known. The study explores the race toward vaccine development and highlights some significant trials and candidates in various clinical phases. This research addresses critical knowledge gaps by identifying repurposed drugs currently under clinical trials. Findings will be fed back rapidly to the researchers interested in COVID 19 and support the evidence and potential of possible therapeutics and small molecules with their mode of action.","Aljabali, Alaa A A; Bakshi, Hamid A; Satija, Saurabh; Metha, Meenu; Prasher, Parteek; Ennab, Raed M; Chellappan, Dinesh K; Gupta, Gaurav; Negi, Poonam; Goyal, Rohit; Sharma, Ashish; Mishra, Vijay; Dureja, Harish; Dua, Kamal; Tambuwala, Murtaza M",Pharm Nanotechnol,,451
383579,ACE2 (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2) and TMPRSS2 (Transmembrane Serine Protease 2) Expression and Localization of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in the Human Heart,2021,"Purpose: This paper addresses the current disruption in the educational status quo ante that has been caused by the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19. Its purpose is to suggest how practicing educators, their professional associations and the university-based researchers with whom they partner might capitalize on the unanticipated opportunity to impact education policy that the pandemic presents. Design/methodology/approach: The author draws upon his own preparation and experiences – first as a long-time practitioner in the elementary and secondary school setting, then as a university professor – to offer insights and suggestions to practicing educators, their professional associations and the university-based researchers with whom they partner. Findings: Despite the unexpected challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic has presented to educators – challenges to which educators around the globe have risen admirably – the current crisis also affords practicing educators, their professional associations and the university-based researchers with whom they partner to change the status quo ante for the better. Originality/value: The particular value of this piece is twofold: its analysis of the impact of this unanticipated crisis upon education by an author who has served both in the elementary/secondary setting and at the university level, and its assertion that educators must avail themselves of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to change the educational status quo ante for the better.","Trombly, Christopher E.",J.

385611,Impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the care for patients with lysosomal disorders: The experience of a Mexican pediatric center,2021,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine has recently been the subject of intense debate regarding its potential antiviral activity against SARS-Cov-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19. Some report possible curative effects; others do not. Therefore, the objective of this study was to simulate possible scenarios of response to hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients using mathematical modeling. METHODS: To shed some light on this controversial topic, we simulated hydroxychloroquine-based interventions on virus/host cell dynamics using a basic system of previously published differential equations. Mathematical modeling was implemented using Python programming language v 3.7. RESULTS: According to mathematical modeling, hydroxychloroquine may have an impact on the amplitude of the viral load peak and viral clearance if the drug is administered early enough (i.e., when the virus is still confined within the pharyngeal cavity). The effects of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine may be fully explained only when also considering the capacity of this drug to increase the death rate of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, in this case by enhancing the cell-mediated immune response. CONCLUSIONS: These considerations may not only be applied to chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine but may have more general implications for development of anti-COVID-19 combination therapies and prevention strategies through an increased death rate of the infected cells.","Tarek, Mohammad; Savarino, Andrea",Eur J Drug Metab Pharmacokinet,,451

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed and included adult inpatients hospitalized from March 17th to May 3rd, 2020, who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical and demographic characteristics were extracted from electronic medical records. RESULTS: Overall, 88 consecutive patients were included in this study. The median age of the patients was 63 years (IQR 49 - 71); 59 (67%) were male, 65 (86%) had a college degree and 67 (76%) had at least one comorbidity. Twenty-nine (33%) patients were admitted to the intensive care unit, 18 (20%) patients needed mechanical ventilation, and 9 (10.2%) died during hospitalization. The median length of stay in the intensive care unit and the median duration of mechanical ventilation was 23 and 29.5 days, respectively. An age &#8805; 65 years was an independent risk factor for mechanical ventilation (OR 8.4 95%CI 1.3 - 55.6 p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Our findings describe the first wave of Brazilian patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Age was the strongest predictor of respiratory insufficiency and the need for mechanical ventilation in our population.","Bastos, Gisele Alsina Nader; Azambuja, Aline Zimmermann de; Polanczyk, Carisi Anne; Gräf, Débora Dalmas; Zorzo, Isabelle Weschenfelder; Maccari, Juçara Gasparetto; Haygert, Lúcia Schnor; Nasi, Luiz Antônio; Gazzana, Marcelo Basso; Bessel, Marina; Pitrez, Paulo Márcio; Oliveira, Roselaine Pinheiro de; Scotta, Marcelo Comerlato",Rev. bras. ter. intensiva,,451
388275,Assessment of the laboratory clinical biochemistry and coagulation requests during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the SMeL2 laboratory of the papa giovanni XXIII hospital in bergamo,2020,"COVID-19 is often related to hyperinflammation that drives lung or multiorgan injury. The immunopathological mechanisms that cause excessive inflammation are under investigation and constantly updated. Here, a gene network approach was used on recently published data sets to identify possible COVID-19 inflammatory mechanisms and bioactive genes. First, network analysis of putative SARS-CoV-2 cellular receptors led to the mining of a neutrophil-response signature and relevant inflammatory genes. Second, analysis of RNA-seq data sets of lung cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 revealed that infected cells expressed neutrophil-attracting chemokines. Third, analysis of RNA-seq data sets of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells from COVID-19 patients identified upregulation of neutrophil genes and chemokines. Different inflammatory genes mined here, including TNFR, IL-8, CXCR1, CXCR2, ADAM10, GPR84, MME, ANPEP, and LAP3, might be druggable targets in efforts to limit SARS-CoV-2 inflammation in severe clinical cases. The possible role of neutrophils in COVID-19 inflammation needs to be studied further.","Didangelos, Athanasios",MSphere,,451

The pandemic brought the world together to a joint effort to find a cure and work toward developing a vaccine. Much to the anticipation, the first batch of vaccines started rolling out by the end of 2020, and many countries began the vaccination drive early on while others still waiting in anticipation for a successful trial. Social media, meanwhile, was bombarded with all sorts of both positive and negative stories of the development and the evolving coronavirus situation. Many people were looking forward to the vaccines, while others were cautious about the side-effects and the conspiracy theories resulting in mixed emotions. This study explores users’ tweets concerning the COVID-19 vaccine and the sentiments expressed on Twitter. It tries to evaluate the polarity trend and a shift since the start of the coronavirus to the vaccination drive across six countries. The findings suggest that people of neighboring countries have shown quite a similar attitude regarding the vaccination in contrast to their different reactions to the coronavirus outbreak.","Batra, Rakhi Imran Ali Shariq Kastrati Zenun Ghafoor Abdul Daudpota Sher Muhammad Shaikh Sarang",Sustainability,,451

392976,Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA antibodies before the launch of COVID-19 vaccination in Kazakhstan,2021,"Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) present a wide range of acute clinical manifestations affecting the lungs, liver, kidneys and gut. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2, the best-characterized entry receptor for the disease-causing virus SARS-CoV-2, is highly expressed in the aforementioned tissues. However, the pathways that underlie the disease are still poorly understood. Here, we unexpectedly found that the complement system was one of the intracellular pathways most highly induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung epithelial cells. Infection of respiratory epithelial cells with SARS-CoV-2 generated activated complement component C3a and could be blocked by a cell-permeable inhibitor of complement factor B (CFBi), indicating the presence of an inducible cell-intrinsic C3 convertase in respiratory epithelial cells. Within cells of the bronchoalveolar lavage of patients, distinct signatures of complement activation in myeloid, lymphoid and epithelial cells tracked with disease severity. Genes induced by SARS-CoV-2 and the drugs that could normalize these genes both implicated the interferon-JAK1/2-STAT1 signaling system and NF-&#954;B as the main drivers of their expression. Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, normalized interferon signature genes and all complement gene transcripts induced by SARS-CoV-2 in lung epithelial cell lines, but did not affect NF-&#954;B-regulated genes. Ruxolitinib, alone or in combination with the antiviral remdesivir, inhibited C3a protein produced by infected cells. Together, we postulate that combination therapy with JAK inhibitors and drugs that normalize NF-&#954;B-signaling could potentially have clinical application for severe COVID-19.","Yan, Bingyu; Freiwald, Tilo; Chauss, Daniel; Wang, Luopin; West, Erin; Mirabelli, Carmen; Zhang, Charles J; Nichols, Eva-Maria; Malik, Nazish; Gregory, Richard; Bantscheff, Marcus; Ghidelli-Disse, Sonja; Kolev, Martin; Frum, Tristan; Spence, Jason R; Sexton, Jonathan Z; Alysandratos, Konstantinos D; Kotton, Darrell N; Pittaluga, Stefania; Bibby, Jack; Niyonzima, Nathalie; Olson, Matthew R; Kordasti, Shahram; Portilla, Didier; Wobus, Christiane E; Laurence, Arian; Lionakis, Michail S; Kemper, Claudia; Afzali, Behdad; Kazemian, Majid",Sci. immunol,,451

The goal of this study was to better depict the short-term risk of stroke and its associated factors among SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized patients. METHODS: This multicentre, multinational observational study includes hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients from North and South America (United States, Canada, and Brazil), Europe (Greece, Italy, Finland, and Turkey), Asia (Lebanon, Iran, and India), and Oceania (New Zealand). The outcome was the risk of subsequent stroke. Centres were included by non-probability sampling. The counts and clinical characteristics including laboratory findings and imaging of the patients with and without a subsequent stroke were recorded according to a predefined protocol. Quality, risk of bias, and heterogeneity assessments were conducted according to ROBINS-E and Cochrane Q-test. The risk of subsequent stroke was estimated through meta-analyses with random effect models. Bivariate logistic regression was used to determine the parameters with predictive outcome value. The study was reported according to the STROBE, MOOSE, and EQUATOR guidelines. FINDINGS: We received data from 26,175 hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients from 99 tertiary centres in 65 regions of 11 countries until May 1st, 2020. A total of 17,799 patients were included in meta-analyses. Among them, 156(0.9%) patients had a stroke-123(79%) ischaemic stroke, 27(17%) intracerebral/subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 6(4%) cerebral sinus thrombosis. Subsequent stroke risks calculated with meta-analyses, under low to moderate heterogeneity, were 0.5% among all centres in all countries, and 0.7% among countries with higher health expenditures. The need for mechanical ventilation (OR: 1.9, 95% CI:1.1-3.5, p = 0.03) and the presence of ischaemic heart disease (OR: 2.5, 95% CI:1.4-4.7, p = 0.006) were predictive of stroke. INTERPRETATION: The results of this multi-national study on hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection indicated an overall stroke risk of 0.5%(pooled risk: 0.9%). The need for mechanical ventilation and the history of ischaemic heart disease are the independent predictors of stroke among SARS-CoV-2 patients.

Because of the gap between the hire and start date in jobs like academia, onboarding programs should include pre-employment onboarding (preboarding) as well.1,3 Orientation is another part of onboarding new pharmacy faculty and is concerned with the administrative aspects of a new job, such as setting up payroll, parking permits, benefits, ID badges, credentialing, and computer access.3 Orientation is an important part of onboarding as it sets the tone for the new employee's transition and shapes their impression of and relationship to the organization.3 Overall, successful onboarding and orientation programs can lead to increased satisfaction and retention of new faculty.1 Under ordinary conditions it is important for a school to have a formal onboarding process in place, but during a global pandemic it is crucial. While some new faculty may want to move early to unpack and explore their new town, relocating during COVID-19 may require quarantining upon arrival and adjusting timelines. Because of social distancing and decreased gatherings, new faculty may have limited opportunities to meet new people in their community. The orientation mentor can also assist new faculty on their first day of work by helping them to complete required paperwork (eg, benefits, timesheets, payroll, and HR training);acquire an employee ID badge;gain office, building, and practice site keys or access cards;identify internet technology (IT) support for secure, encrypted, WiFi and on-and-off campus network connections;access library and virtual private networks (VPNs);secure computer passwords, equipment, supplies, and parking permits;and obtain and set up an office.8 The orientation mentor can also help new faculty with completing credentialing paperwork necessary to acquire practice site privileges. An onboarding mentor can serve as a ""sponsor"" whose job it is to facilitate introductions by connecting, advocating, and using their influence to make recommendations.11 Onboarding mentors should serve as a bridge for early relationship formation and formally introduce the new faculty member to faculty, staff, and students to decrease the guesswork behind ""the new person"" in the building.","Bhakta, Kajal PharmD Medina Melissa S.

Telehealth technology use is established in the ambulatory setting, but not yet widely deployed at scale for inpatient care. OBJECTIVES: This article presents and describes our experience with evaluating and implementing inpatient telehealth technologies in a large health care system with the goals of reducing use of PPE while enhancing communication for health care workers and patients. METHODS: We discovered use cases for inpatient telehealth revealed as a result of an immense patient surge requiring large volumes of PPE. In response, we assessed various consumer products to address the use cases for our health system. RESULTS: We identified 13 use cases and eight device options. During device setup and implementation, challenges and solutions were identified in five areas: security/privacy, device availability and setup, device functionality, physical setup, and workflow and device usage. This enabled deployment of more than 1,800 devices for inpatient telehealth across seven hospitals with positive feedback from health care staff. CONCLUSION: Large-scale setup and distribution of consumer devices is feasible for inpatient telehealth use cases. Our experience highlights operational barriers and potential solutions for health systems looking to preserve PPE and enhance vital communication.","Ong, Shawn Y; Stump, Lisa; Zawalich, Matthew; Edwards, Lisa; Stanton, Glynn; Matthews, Michael; Hsiao, Allen L",Appl Clin Inform,,451

395842,"""For COVID"" or ""With COVID"": Classification of SARS-CoV-2 Hospitalizations in Children",2021,"Background: Government responses to managing the COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted the way individuals were able to engage in physical activity. Digital platforms are a promising way to support physical activity levels and may have provided an alternative for people to maintain their activity while at home. Objective: This study aimed to examine associations between the use of digital platforms and adherence to the physical activity guidelines among Australian adults and adolescents during the COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions in April and May 2020. Methods: A national online survey was distributed in May 2020. Participants included 1188 adults (mean age 37.4 years, SD 15.1;980/1188, 82.5% female) and 963 adolescents (mean age 16.2 years, SD 1.2;685/963, 71.1% female). Participants reported demographic characteristics, use of digital platforms for physical activity over the previous month, and adherence to moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) and muscle-strengthening exercise (MSE) guidelines. Multilevel logistic regression models examined differences in guideline adherence between those who used digital platforms (ie, users) to support their physical activity compared to those who did not (ie, nonusers). Results: Digital platforms include streaming services for exercise (eg, YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook);subscriber fitness programs, via an app or online (eg, Centr and MyFitnessPal);facilitated online live or recorded classes, via platforms such as Zoom (eg, dance, sport training, and fitness class);sport- or activity-specific apps designed by sporting organizations for participants to keep up their skills (eg, TeamBuildr);active electronic games (eg, Xbox Kinect);and/or online or digital training or racing platforms (eg, Zwift, FullGaz, and Rouvy). Overall, 39.5% (469/1188) of adults and 26.5% (255/963) of adolescents reported using digital platforms for physical activity. Among adults, MVPA (odds ratio [OR] 2.0, 95% CI 1.5-2.7), MSE (OR 3.3, 95% CI 2.5-4.5), and combined (OR 2.7, 95% CI 2.0-3.8) guideline adherence were higher among digital platform users relative to nonusers. Adolescents' MVPA (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3-4.3), MSE (OR 3.1, 95% CI 2.1-4.4), and combined (OR 4.3, 95% CI 2.1-9.0) guideline adherence were also higher among users of digital platforms relative to nonusers. Conclusions: Digital platform users were more likely than nonusers to meet MVPA and MSE guidelines during the COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions in April and May 2020. Digital platforms may play a critical role in helping to support physical activity engagement when access to facilities or opportunities for physical activity outside the home are restricted.

METHODS: We conducted a follow-up study on children whose mothers participated in a randomized clinical trial to receive placebo, 150 µg/day or 300 µg/day of iodine until 12 months postpartum. Child neurocognitive development was assessed at 36 months of age using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Third Edition. Linear mixed-model analysis was preformed to assess iodine supplement dose effects on child cognitive, language, and motor functions. RESULTS: A total of 122 children provided neurodevelopmental data as follows: 300 µg/d iodine group: 45; 150 µg/d iodine group: 35; and placebo group: 42. Cognitive scores were higher in children whose mothers received 150 µg iodine/d compared to children whose mothers received placebo [102.8 (SD 13.2) vs. 99.2 (SD 10.5); ß = 4.43, P = 0.032]. However, supplementation with 150 µg iodine/d had no effect on language or motor development. No significant differences were observed in cognitive, language, or motor functions between children whose mothers received 300 µg iodine/d and those whose mothers received 150 µg iodine/d or placebo. CONCLUSION: Maternal iodine supplementation with 150 µg/d during lactation may have a beneficial effect on child cognitive development; however, we found no evidence of either improved or delayed neurodevelopmental outcomes in children whose mothers received iodine supplements at doses higher than recommended. Further randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these results.

398438,Complete blood count might help to identify subjects with high probability of testing positive to SARS-CoV-2,2020,"In this research, a quantitative model is built to predict people's susceptibility to COVID-19 based on their genomes. Identifying people vulnerable to COVID-19 infections is crucial in stopping the spread of the virus. In previous studies, researchers have found that individuals with comorbid diseases have higher chances of being infected and developing more severe COVID-19 conditions. However, these patterns are only observed through correlational analyses between patient phenotypes and the severity of their COVID-19 infection. In this study, genetic variants underlying the observed comorbidity patterns are analyzed through machine learning of COVID-19 data from GWAS studies, which may reveal biological pathways underlying COVID-19 contraction that are essential to the development of effective and targeted therapeutics. Furthermore, through combining genetic variants with the individual's phenotypes, this study built a Neural Network model and Random Forest classifier to predict an individual's likelihood of COVID-19 infection. The Random Forest Classifier in this study shows that on-going symptoms are generally better predictors of COVID-19 condition (higher impurity-based feature importance) than diseases or medical histories. In addition, when trained with genomic data, the comorbid disease impact ranking deduced by the resulting RF model is highly consistent with phenotypic comorbidity patterns observed in past studies.","Wang, R.

399986,Short-Term Consequences of SARS-CoV-2-Related Pneumonia: A Follow Up Study,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged as a new contagion during December 2019, since which time it has triggered a rampant spike in fatality rates worldwide due to insufficient medical treatments and a lack of counteragents and prompted the World Health Organization to declare COVID-19 a public health emergency. It is, therefore, vital to accelerate the screening of new molecules or vaccines to win the battle against this pandemic. Experiences from previous epidemiological data on coronaviruses guide investigators in designing and exploring new compounds for a safe and cost-effective treatment. Several reports on the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic indicate that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the novel COVID-19 use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for binding to the host cell in the lung epithelia through the spike protein on their virion surface. ACE2 is a mono-carboxypeptidase best known for cleaving major peptides and substrates. Its degree in human airway epithelia positively correlates with coronavirus infection. The treatment approach can be the neutralization of the virus entering lung epithelial cells by using sera containing antibodies collected from COVID-19-recovered patients. Hence, we herein propose a pulmonary aerosolized formulation or a nasal drop using sera, which contain antibodies to prevent, treat, or immunize against COVID-19 infection.

We compared analytic performances, feasibility and acceptability of NPS, saliva, and oral-self sampling swab for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A prospective, multicenter study was conducted in military hospitals in France among adult outpatients attending COVID-19 diagnosis centers or hospitalized patients. For each patient, all samples were obtained and analyzed simultaneously with RT-PCR or transcription-mediated amplification method. Clinical signs, feasibility, and acceptability for each type of sample were collected. A total of 1220 patients were included, corresponding to 1205 NPS and saliva and 771 OS. Compared to NPS, the sensitivity, specificity, and kappa coefficient for tests performed on saliva were 87.8% (95% CI 83.3-92.3), 97.1% (95% CI 96.1-98.1), and 0.84 (95% CI 0.80-0.88). Analytical performances were better in symptomatic patients. Ct values were significantly lower in NPS than saliva. For OS, sensitivity was estimated to be 61.1% (95% CI 52.7-69.4) and Kappa coefficient to be 0.69 (95% CI 0.62-0.76). OS was the technique preferred by the patients (44.3%) before saliva (42.4%) and NPS (13.4%). Instructions were perceived as simple by patients (> 90%) for saliva and OS. Finally, the painful nature was estimated to be 0.9 for OS, on a scale from 0 to 10, and to be 5.3 for NPS. Performances of OS are not sufficient. Saliva is an acceptable alternative to NPS for symptomatic patient but the process required additional steps to fluidize the sample.","Plantamura, Julie; Bousquet, Aurore; Otto, Marie-Pierre; Bigaillon, Christine; Legland, Anne-Margaux; Delacour, Hervé; Vest, Philippe; Astier, Hélène; Valero, Elodie; Bylicki, Olivier; Renard, Christophe; Martin, Solenne; Verret, Catherine; Garnotel, Eric; Foissaud, Vincent; Mérens, Audrey; Janvier, Frédéric",Eur. j. clin. microbiol. infect. dis,,451

403537,Does PCR Cycle Threshold for SARS-CoV-2 have Association with ABO Blood Group Types?,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The symptoms of thiamine deficiency vary considerably and asymptomatic cases; i.e., subclinical thiamine deficiency (SCTD), are known to exist. However, there is no information available on the treatment of SCTD. METHODS: We report a patient who underwent intravenous thiamine replacement therapy for about a month after being diagnosed with SCTD, but who developed SCTD again about three weeks after finishing the treatment. RESULTS: The patient was a 64-year-old woman who, after starting treatment for cervical cancer, complained of anxiety and underwent an initial psychiatric examination. The psychiatric diagnosis was an adjustment disorder. Based on the possibility of SCTD complications due to her decreased appetite and weight loss, her serum thiamine concentration was measured and found to be low. Therefore, thiamine was administered intravenously for 29 days. At the end of treatment, thiamine administration was discontinued as there were no apparent neuropsychiatric symptoms or problems with appetite. Twenty-three days later, there were still no problems with appetite or neuropsychiatric symptoms, but a follow-up blood sample revealed that her serum thiamine was again below the normal range. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Currently, there is no information available regarding the diagnosis and treatment of SCTD in cancer patients. In some cases, such as this case, the deficiency recurs without any symptoms indicative of SCTD; therefore, further examination for diagnosis and treatment is necessary.","Onishi, Hideki; Uchida, Nozomu; Itami, Kumi; Sato, Masakazu; Tamura, Saki; Kurosaki, Akira; Ishida, Mayumi",Palliat Support Care,,451

With limited existing research, the aim of this study was to explore the psychological effects of COVID-19 public health measures on older adults in Uganda and their coping mechanisms.Methods: Thirty semi-structured interviews were conducted with older Ugandans (aged 60+) in June 2020. Participants were asked about their experiences of public health measures, and their effects on the lives of older adults compared to pre-pandemic.Results: Three themes were identified: Impact on emotional well-being; Implications on physical well-being; and Coping mechanisms. Older adults experienced both psychological and physical effects, including upset, fear, and frustration about restrictions and the virus, as well as early signs of increased frailty, thus causing concerns for the long-term emotional and physical health of older Ugandans.Conclusions: Public health measures need to be considerate of the potential long-term implications on the well-being of older adults in low-, middle-, and high-income countries, and ensure the possibility for continued physical exercise and social connection. This can be particularly challenging for people from more disadvantaged backgrounds who may not be able to afford a smartphone or laptop, with older adults further requiring support in using digital technologies.Clinical Implications: Older adults need to receive adequate psychological support to cope with the mental health impacts of the pandemic.","Giebel, Clarissa; Ivan, Bwire; Ddumba, Isaac",Clin Gerontol,,451

Transition metal compounds (TMCs) can deliver a high capacitance and energy density when applied as pseudocapacitive or battery-like electrode materials owing to their large theoretical capacitance and faradaic charge-storage mechanism. The recent development of TMCs (metal oxides/hydroxides, phosphides, sulfides, nitrides, and selenides) as electrode materials for FS-SCs are discussed here. First, fundamental energy-storage mechanisms of distinct TMCs, various flexible and stretchable substrates, and electrolytes for FS-SCs are presented. Then, the electrochemical performance and features of TMC-based electrodes for FS-SCs are categorically analyzed. The gravimetric, areal, and volumetric energy density of SC using TMC electrodes are summarized in Ragone plots. More importantly, several recent design strategies for achieving high-performance TMC-based electrodes are highlighted, including material composition, current collector design, nanostructure design, doping/intercalation, defect engineering, phase control, valence tuning, and surface coating. Integrated systems that combine wearable electronics with FS-SCs are introduced.

406227,Towards the rational utilization of SARS-CoV-2 serological tests in clinical practice,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Data on race and ethnic disparities for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are limited. We analysed sociodemographic factors associated with higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection and explore mediating pathways for race and ethnic disparities in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional analysis of the COVID-19 Surveillance and Outcomes Registry, which captures data for a large healthcare system, comprising one central tertiary care hospital, seven large community hospitals and an expansive ambulatory/emergency care network in the Greater Houston area. Nasopharyngeal samples for individuals inclusive of all ages, races, ethnicities and sex were tested for SARS-CoV-2. We analysed sociodemographic (age, sex, race, ethnicity, household income, residence population density) and comorbidity (Charlson Comorbidity Index, hypertension, diabetes, obesity) factors. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to provide adjusted OR (aOR) and 95% CI for likelihood of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Structural equation modelling (SEM) framework was used to explore three mediation pathways (low income, high population density, high comorbidity burden) for the association between non-Hispanic black (NHB) race, Hispanic ethnicity and SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Among 20 228 tested individuals, 1551 (7.7%) tested positive. The overall mean (SD) age was 51.1 (19.0) years, 62% were females, 22% were black and 18% were Hispanic. NHB and Hispanic ethnicity were associated with lower socioeconomic status and higher population density residence. In the fully adjusted model, NHB (vs non-Hispanic white; aOR, 2.23, CI 1.90 to 2.60) and Hispanic ethnicity (vs non-Hispanic; aOR, 1.95, CI 1.72 to 2.20) had a higher likelihood of infection.

To date, there are no approved therapies or vaccines for this disease. Various therapeutic options are being explored and vaccines are being developed. Convalescent plasma is an interesting therapeutic option against COVID-19, as it has been successfully used in other viral outbreaks in the past. This therapy consists of collecting plasma from individuals recovered from the viral disease who developed antibodies. It is considered the only short-term strategy to confer immediate immunity to susceptible individuals. This review addresses the possible mechanisms of action of convalescent plasma, we give a panoramic view of the first studies carried out on COVID-19, as well as the necessary procedures to implement this therapy. © 2021 Quintessence Publishing Co., Ltd.

Although airborne spread through infectious respiratory droplets is the primary source of transmission, recent literature has suggested the ocular surface may be able to harbor viral particles. Here, we aim to discuss how SARS-CoV-2 affects the ocular surface and updated guidance on how SARS-CoV-2 transmission should be considered in the setting of eye banking and corneal transplantation procedures. RECENT FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be found on the ocular surface, which may suggest the eye as a site of viral replication. However, there is poor correlation between PCR positivity on the ocular surface and ocular symptoms. To date, although viral particles can be found on the ocular surface, use of standard antiseptic procedures during corneal tissue procurement appears to sufficiently reduce viral load. In addition, preprocedure testing may further decrease the chances of transplanting an infected cornea without significantly impacting the overall accessibility to corneal tissue by decreasing the donor pool. SUMMARY: Corneal transplantation remains a well tolerated and highly successful procedure with no evidence of viral transmission with transplantation.

Although the near-field transmission and the infectious spread within individual rooms are well studied, the impact of aerosolized spread of SARS-CoV-2 via air handling systems within buildings remains unexplored. This study evaluates the concentrations and probabilities of infection for both building interior and exterior exposure sources using a well-mixed model in a multi-room building served by a central air handling system (without packaged terminal air conditioning). In particular, we compare the influence of filtration, air change rates, and the fraction of outdoor air. When the air supplied to the rooms comprises both outdoor air and recirculated air, we find filtration lowers the concentration and probability of infection the most in both source and connected rooms. We find that increasing the air change rate removes virus from the source room faster but also increases the rate of exposure in connected rooms. Therefore, slower air change rates reduce infectivity in connected rooms at shorter durations. We further find that increasing the fraction of virus-free outdoor air is helpful, unless outdoor air is infective in which case pathogen exposure inside persists for hours after a short-term release. Increasing the outdoor air to 33% or the filter to MERV-13 decreases the infectivity in the connected rooms by 19% or 93% respectively, relative to a MERV-8 filter with 9% outdoor air based on 100 quanta/h of 5â¯µm droplets, a breathing rate of 0.48â¯m3/h, and the building dimensions and air handling system considered.","Pease, Leonard F; Wang, Na; Salsbury, Timothy I; Underhill, Ronald M; Flaherty, Julia E; Vlachokostas, Alex; Kulkarni, Gourihar; James, Daniel P",Build Environ,,451

Preliminary studies indicated an increased frequency of gaming and social media use during this time and augmented levels of loneliness likely account for the increase in gaming and social media addiction during lockdown. We conducted a longitudinal study administering a battery of self-report questionnaires at the beginning of lockdown (Stage 1) and three days before the end of the lockdown (Stage 2). Specifically, we measured loneliness feelings, frequency of gaming, and social media use, as well as both gaming and social media addiction. Data were analysed using Structural Equation Modeling. We found that loneliness levels longitudinally predicted both gaming and social media addiction, even when controlling for gaming and social media use at Stage 1. Increased feelings of loneliness, a well-known risk factor for gaming, along with social media addiction, may be a central variable heightening vulnerability to the onset or the maintenance of technological addiction during forced social isolation. Thus, future preventive interventions may want to target this issue.","Rogier, G.; Zobel, S. B.; Velotti, P.",Journal of Gambling Issues,,451

The unprecedented scale and rapidity of dissemination of recent emerging infectious diseases pose new challenges for vaccine developers, regulators, health authorities and political constituencies. Vaccine manufacturing and distribution are complex and challenging. While speed is essential, clinical development to emergency use authorization and licensure, pharmacovigilance of vaccine safety and surveillance of virus variants are also critical. Access to vaccines and vaccination needs to be prioritized in low- and middle-income countries.

In this study, we perform an in-depth, fine-grained sentiment analysis of tweets in COVID-19. For this purpose, we perform supervised training of four transformer language models on the downstream task of multi-label classification of tweets into seven tone classes: [confident, anger, fear, joy, sadness, analytical, tentative]. We achieve a LRAP (Label Ranking Average Precision) score of 0.9267 through RoBERTa. This trained transformer model is able to correctly predict, with high accuracy, the tone of a tweet. We then leverage this model for predicting tones for 200,000 tweets on COVID-19. We then perform a country-wise analysis of the tone of tweets, and extract useful indicators of the psychological condition about the people in this pandemic.","Azeemi, Abdul Hameed; Waheed, Adeel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00199v1.pdf,451

413186,"My Kingdom for a Denominator, or at Least Enough Data",2020,"BACKGROUND: Early diagnostic indicators and the identification of possible progression to severe or critical COVID-19 in children are unknown. To investigate the immune characteristics of early SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and possible key prognostic factors for early identification of critical COVID-19, a retrospective study including 121 children with COVID-19 was conducted. Peripheral blood lymphocyte subset counts, T cell-derived cytokine concentrations, inflammatory factor concentrations, and routine blood counts were analyzed statistically at the initial presentation. RESULTS: The T lymphocyte subset and natural killer cell counts decreased with increasing disease severity. Group III (critical cases) had a higher Th/Tc ratio than groups I and II (common and severe cases); group I had a higher B cell count than groups II and III. IL-6, IL-10, IFN-Î³, SAA, and procalcitonin levels increased with increasing disease severity. Hemoglobin concentration, and RBC and eosinophil counts decreased with increasing disease severity. Groups II and III had significantly lower lymphocyte counts than group I. T, Th, Tc, IL-6, IL-10, RBC, and hemoglobin had relatively high contribution and area under the curve values. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased T, Th, Tc, RBC, hemoglobin and increased IL-6 and IL-10 in early SARS-CoV-2 infection in children are valuable indices for early diagnosis of severe disease. The significantly reduced Th and Tc cells and significantly increased IL-6, IL-10, ferritin, procalcitonin, and SAA at this stage in children with critical COVID-19 may be closely associated with the systemic cytokine storm caused by immune dysregulation.","Lu, Wenjie; Yang, Li; Li, Xiong; Sun, Ming; Zhang, Aiping; Qi, Shanshan; Chen, Zhi; Zhang, Lannan; Li, Jianxin; Xiong, Hao",BMC Pediatr,,451

As the COVID-19 epidemic in China would coincide with a seasonal outbreak of influenza, there were serious concerns about whether influenza would be aggravated by the SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 pandemic. This article provides a brief overview of the impacts of the COVID-19 epidemic on influenza activity in China. The percentage of positive influenza tests decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the first stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, the percentage of positive influenza tests reached to a peak of 47.7%. At the second stage, the percentage of positive influenza tests was dramatically decreased from 40.4% to 14.0%. Thereafter, it remains at a low level of less than 6.2%. In addition, the possible causes of this phenomenon have been summarized, including prevention and control measures and ecological competition. Lastly, this article suggests that the public health approach to preventing COVID-19 may also help to control other respiratory infectious diseases.

The disease evolved into a serious global emergency, leading to its declaration as a pandemic. Discussion: On the African continent, Nigeria is just experiencing the direct effects of this pandemic, having recorded her index case in February 2020, with an increasing number of cases every day and a current case fatality ratio of 0.03 as at 13 April 2020. Although the recorded cases may seem low, it has been forecast that Africa will have some of the worst effects of this disease by the end of the pandemic. Generally, African countries have fragile health systems and this remains a source of concern, especially in the event of increased outbreaks. Nigeria's current national health systems cannot effectively respond to the growing needs of already infected patients requiring admission into intensive care units for acute respiratory diseases and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS COV-2) pneumonia. This has grim implications for Nigeria, especially as increased cases loom that may require critical care. Provision of quarantine or isolation facilities and availability of rapid diagnostic kits for fast and reliable testing and diagnosis of the disease can also be a challenge in Africa.","Ohia, C.; Bakarey, A.

Infection with SARS-CoV-2 appears to exhibit a similar spectrum of outcomes to that seen in the general population, with 11 people admitted to intensive care (7 post-transplant), and 7 deaths (3 post-transplant). A more severe clinical course may be associated with older age, CF-related diabetes, lower lung function in the year prior to infection, and having received an organ transplant. Whilst outcomes in this large cohort are better than initially feared overall, possibly due to a protective effect of the relatively younger age of the CF population compared to other chronic conditions, SARS-CoV-2 is not a benign disease for all people in this patient group.","McClenaghan, Elliot; Cosgriff, Rebecca; Brownlee, Keith; Ahern, Susannah; Burgel, Pierre-Régis; Byrnes, Catherine A; Colombo, Carla; Corvol, Harriet; Cheng, Stephanie Y; Daneau, Géraldine; Elbert, Alexander; Faro, Albert; Goss, Christopher H; Gulmans, Vincent; Gutierrez, Hector; de Monestrol, Isabelle; Jung, Andreas; Justus, Lutz Nährlich; Kashirskaya, Nataliya; Marshall, Bruce C; McKone, Edward; Middleton, Peter G; Mondejar-Lopez, Pedro; Pastor-Vivero, M Dolores; Padoan, Rita; Rizvi, Samar; Ruseckaite, Rasa; Salvatore, Marco; Stephenson, Anne L; Filho, Luiz Vicente R da Silva; Melo, Joel; Zampoli, Marco; Carr, Siobhán B",J Cyst Fibros,,451
420537,Saliva as a promising biofluid for SARS-CoV-2 detection during the early stages of infection,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented numbers of patients with acute respiratory distress to medical centers. Hospital systems require rapid adaptation to respond to the increased demand for airway management while ensuring high quality patient care and provider safety. There is limited literature detailing successful system-level approaches to adapt to the surge of COVID-19 patients requiring airway management. METHODS: A deliberate system-level approach was used to expand a preexisting airway response service. Through a needs analysis (taking into account both existing resources and anticipated demands), we established priorities and solutions for the airway management challenges encountered during the pandemic. RESULTS: During our COVID-19 surge (March 10, 2020, through May 26, 2020), there were 619 airway consults, and the COVID airway response team (CART) performed 341 intubations. Despite a 4-fold increase in intubations during the surge, there was no increase in cardiac arrests or surgical airways and no documented COVID-19 infections among the CART. CONCLUSIONS: Our system-level approach successfully met the sudden escalation in demand in airway management incurred by the COVID-19 surge. The approach that addressed staffing needs prioritized provider protection and enhanced quality and safety monitoring may be adaptable to other institutions.","Walsh, Elisa C; Kwo, Jean; Chang, Marvin G; Pino, Richard M; Bittner, Edward A",J. healthc. qual.

424370,Suggesting Ritonavir against COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly modified Earth's social-ecological systems in many ways; here we study its impacts on human-nature interactions. We conducted an online survey focused on peoples' relationships with the non-human world during the pandemic and received valid responses from 3,204 adult residents of the state of Vermont (U.S.A.). We analyzed reported changes in outdoor activities and the values associated with human-nature relationships across geographic areas and demographic characteristics. We find that participation increased on average for some activities (foraging, gardening, hiking, jogging, photography and other art, relaxing alone, walking, and watching wildlife), and decreased for others (camping, relaxing with others). The values respondents ranked as more important during the pandemic factored into two groups, which we label as ""Nurture and Recreation values"" and ""Inspiration and Nourishment values."" Using multinomial logistic regression, we found that respondents' preferences for changes in activity engagement and value factors are statistically associated with some demographic characteristics, including geography, gender, income, and employment status during the pandemic. Our results suggest that nature may play an important role in coping during times of crisis, but that the specific interactions and associated values that people perceive as most important may vary between populations. Our findings emphasize for both emergency and natural resources planning the importance of understanding variation in how and why people interact with and benefit from nature during crises.","Morse, Joshua W; Gladkikh, Tatiana M; Hackenburg, Diana M; Gould, Rachelle K",PLoS One,,451

As the earliest outbreak area of the pandemic, Wuhan, People's Republic of China, is gradually recovering to its normal state under the effective control of government authorities. Outpatient services in major hospitals are now being restored. An accumulation of asymptomatic infections is a potential risk for medical personnel, especially when there is crowding in hospitals. As the biggest center for orthopaedic patients in Wuhan, our orthopaedic outpatient department admits &gt;300 patients per day. Optimal guidelines on how to handle this huge number of patients during the post-outbreak stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly with regard to potential asymptomatic infection, are urgently needed for orthopaedic surgeons. We have developed and proposed applicable guidelines to fill this knowledge gap, including the necessary protective strategies for medical personnel in orthopaedic outpatient and inpatient wards as well as during surgery. We also have provided mental health recommendations for health-care workers. To the best of our knowledge, these guidelines are the first of their kind for orthopaedic surgeons who are slowly reestablishing medical activity following the pandemic.","Xiong, Yuan; Chen, Lang; Lin, Ze; Panayi, Adriana C.; Mi, Bobin; Liu, Guohui",J Bone Joint Surg Am,,451

India imposed a lockdown in March 2020 to contain the spread of the pandemic. Limited mobility, lack of clarity about abortion as an essential service and abortion as a service permitted through telemedicine, shut down of services providing long-acting and permanent methods of contraception, and changes to decision-making about birthing and parenting during a pandemic are factors that may impact the demand for abortion during and after the lockdown. Shortage of raw materials and limited inter- and intra- state transport of drugs may result in breakages in the supply of medication abortion. Given that 73 percent of abortions in India in 2015 occurred outside of health facilities, the pandemic may have several implications on the need for evidence-based information and quality abortion services, as well as if and how medication abortion is accessed in India, and what self-managed abortion looks like in the COVID-19 era. We discuss factors contributing to reduced access to abortion, changes in abortion need, and suggest strategies to respond to an increased demand for abortion in India.","Chandrasekaran, Sruthi; Diamond-Smith, Nadia; Srinivasan, Karthik; Dalvie, Suchitra",Stud Fam Plann,,451

428483,"SARS-CoV-2, a virus with many faces: a series of cases with prolonged persistence of COVID-19 symptoms",2020,"Twenty years ago, the discovery of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was an important breakthrough dramatically enhancing our understanding of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The classical RAS is driven by its key enzyme ACE and is pivotal in the regulation of blood pressure and fluid homeostasis. More recently, it has been recognised that the protective RAS regulated by ACE2 counterbalances many of the deleterious effects of the classical RAS. Studies in murine models demonstrated that manipulating the protective RAS can dramatically alter many diseases including liver disease. Liver-specific overexpression of ACE2 in mice with liver fibrosis has proved to be highly effective in antagonising liver injury and fibrosis progression. Importantly, despite its highly protective role in disease pathogenesis, ACE2 is hijacked by SARS-CoV-2 as a cellular receptor to gain entry to alveolar epithelial cells, causing COVID-19, a severe respiratory disease in humans. COVID-19 is frequently life-threatening especially in elderly or people with other medical conditions. As an unprecedented number of COVID-19 patients have been affected globally, there is an urgent need to discover novel therapeutics targeting the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2. Understanding the role of ACE2 in physiology, pathobiology and as a cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection provides insight into potential new therapeutic strategies aiming to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection related tissue injury. This review outlines the role of the RAS with a strong focus on ACE2-driven protective RAS in liver disease and provides therapeutic approaches to develop strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.","Warner, Fiona J; Rajapaksha, Harinda; Shackel, Nicholas; Herath, Chandana B",Clin Sci (Lond),,451

While alcohol consumption fluctuates during a typical semester among students, the impact of the sudden changes stemming from the pandemic on students' alcohol consumption patterns is unclear. To examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on college student alcohol consumption while accounting for legal drinking age and living situation. Data were collected from students (n = 302) at a large, northeastern U.S. university at the beginning and end of the of the 2019 and 2020 Spring semesters via an online survey that assessed socio-demographic characteristics (age, gender, race/ethnicity, living situation) and alcohol consumption using the daily drinking questionnaire. Data were analyzed using a 2 (cohort group: COVID-19 vs. normal) × 2 (age group: above 21 vs. under 21) × 2 (time: beginning vs. end of the semester) mixed model ANOVA. There was a significant three-way interaction. Students over the legal drinking age impacted by the pandemic demonstrated a drastic decrease in alcohol consumption by the end of the semester compared to those under normal circumstances. Change in living situation as a result of the pandemic drastically impacted the alcohol consumption patterns of students over the legal drinking age. Suggestions for future research on the continuing effects of the pandemic on students are discussed.","Ryerson, Nicole C; Wilson, Oliver W A; Pena, Alejandra; Duffy, Michele; Bopp, Melissa",Transl Behav Med,,451

The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the urgent need for better tools to manage chronic conditions remotely, as regular access to clinics may be problematic. Digital health technology in the form of remote monitoring with body-worn sensors offers significant opportunities for transforming research and revolutionizing the clinical management of PD. Significant efforts are being invested in the development and validation of digital outcomes to support diagnosis and track motor and mobility impairments ""off-line"". Imagine being able to remotely assess your patient, understand how well they are functioning, evaluate the impact of any recent medication/intervention, and identify the need for urgent follow-up because things are changing? This could offer new pragmatic solutions for personalized care and clinical research. So the question remains: how close are we to achieving this? Here, we describe the state-of-the-art based on representative papers published between 2017 and 2020. We focus on remote (i.e., real-world, daily-living) monitoring of PD using body-worn sensors (e.g., accelerometers, inertial measurement units) for assessing motor symptoms and their complications. Despite the tremendous potential, existing challenges exist (e.g., validity, regulatory) that are preventing the widespread clinical adoption of body-worn sensors as a digital outcome. We propose a roadmap with clear recommendations for addressing these challenges and future directions to bring us closer to the implementation and widespread adoption of this important way of improving the clinical care, evaluation, and monitoring of PD.","Del Din, Silvia; Kirk, Cameron; Yarnall, Alison J; Rochester, Lynn; Hausdorff, Jeffrey M",Journal of Parkinson&#039;s disease (Online),,451

We evaluate the risk of mortality, cardiovascular events, and hepatic outcomes between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor users and nonusers in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cirrhosis. METHODS: We selected 2828 paired propensity score matched DPP-4 inhibitor users and nonusers from a cohort of T2DM with compensated liver cirrhosis between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2012. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the risk of main outcomes for DPP-4 inhibitor users. RESULTS: The incidence rate of decompensated cirrhosis during follow-up was 2.20 and 1.53 per 100 patient-years (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.77) for DPP-4 inhibitor users and nonusers, respectively. The aHRs (95% CI) of variceal bleeding and hepatic failure were 1.67 (1.11-2.52) and 1.35 (1.02-1.79), respectively, for DPP-4 inhibitor users over nonusers. The risk of all-cause mortality, hepatocellular carcinoma, and major cardiovascular events between DPP-4 inhibitor users and nonusers were not statistically different. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that DPP-4 inhibitor users were associated with higher risks of decompensated cirrhosis and hepatic failure than did nonusers among patients with T2DM and compensated liver cirrhosis. We must continue to search for appropriate antidiabetic drugs for patients with liver cirrhosis.","Yen, Fu-Shun; Wei, James Cheng-Chung; Yip, Hei-Tung; Hwu, Chii-Min; Hou, Ming-Chih; Hsu, Chih-Cheng",Hepatol. int.

Understanding the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children is important because of the potential impact on clinical management and public health decisions. METHODS: A meta-analysis was conducted for pediatric COVID-19 studies using PubMed and Scopus. It reviewed demographics, co-morbidities, clinical manifestations, laboratory investigations, radiological investigations, treatment, and outcomes. The 95% confidence interval (CI) was utilized. RESULTS: Out of 3927 articles, 31 articles comprising of 1816 patients were selected from December 2019 to early October 2020 and were defined by 77 variables. Of these studies 58% originated from China and the remainder from North America, Europe and the Middle East. This meta-analysis revealed that 19.2% (CI 13.6%-26.4%) of patients were asymptomatic. Fever (57%, CI 49.7%-64%) and cough (44.1%, CI 38.3%-50.2%) were the most common symptoms. The most frequently encountered white blood count abnormalities were lymphopenia 13.5% (CI 8.2%-21.4%) and leukopenia 12.6% (CI 8.5%-18.3%). Ground glass opacities were the most common radiological finding of children with COVID-19 (35.5%, CI 28.9%-42.7%). Hospitalization rate was 96.3% (CI 92.4%-98.2%) of which 10.8% (CI 4.2%-25.3%) were ICU admissions, and 2.4% (CI 1.7%-3.4%) died. CONCLUSION: The majority of pediatric patients with COVID-19 were asymptomatic or had mild manifestations. Among hospitalized patients there remains a significant number that require intensive care unit care.

There is considerable evidence that music can provide an affordable, accessible way to reduce changes in behaviour associated with dementia, in order to meet these standards of care. However, a number of barriers exist to the effective implementation of music programs in long-term aged care facilities. Methods: This study involved focus groups with 17 participants including staff in residential aged care facilities and family caregivers to investigate the benefits of music programs, as well as the challenges and possible solutions to them. A general inductive approach was taken to data analysis. Results: A number of benefits of music programs were identified, including improvements to the wellbeing of both residents of aged care facilities and their caregivers. However, an ingrained culture within residential aged care of focusing on physical care rather than thinking holistically about wellbeing was identified as a significant barrier. Discussion: These findings revealed that education is a key component of changing ingrained cultures of task-driven care at both a managerial level and in care staff, so that attention can be given to psychological and emotional needs as well as the physical.","Garrido, Sandra Markwell Holly Andreallo Fiona Hatcher Deborah",Journal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare,,451

It is believed that early reports of COVID-19 cases were noticed in December 2019 and soon after it became a global public health emergency. It is advised that COVID-19 transmits through human to human contact and in most cases, it remains asymptomatic. Several approaches are being utilized to control the outbreak of this fatal viral disease. microRNAs (miRNAs) are known signature therapeutic tool for the viral diseases; they are small non-coding RNAs that target the mRNAs to inhibit their post-transcriptional expression, therefore, impeding their functions, can serve as watchdogs or micromanagers in the cells. AREAS COVERED: This review work delineated COVID-19 and its association with SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the possible role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, and therapeutic potential of miRNAs and their effective delivery to treat COVID-19. EXPERT OPINION: This review highlighted the importance of various miRNAs and their potential role in fighting with this pandemic as therapeutic molecules utilizing nanotechnology.","Chauhan, Neeraj; Jaggi, Meena; Chauhan, Subhash C; Yallapu, Murali M",Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,,451

Todos los países del mundo se encuentran en procesos de prevención sanitaria contra la COVID-19, un virus que ataca agresivamente el sistema inmunológico de las personas. Intentar llevar a cabo cualquier actividad supone un riesgo de contagio, ya que el coronavirus se propaga sobre todo a través del aliento humano, lo cual ha supuesto la irrupción de nuevos hábitos cotidianos, como usar siempre la mascarilla, o no poder reunirse con otra gente para celebraciones y eventos, ni tampoco dar clase en el aula. Inmersos en esta tesitura, desfavorable para cualquier intento de normalidad educativa, en el caso de la educación artística padecemos doblemente esta penosa realidad. En la coyuntura española, iniciábamos el año presentando una serie de alegaciones a la nueva ley de educación que el gobierno quiere aprobar (LOMLOE), una ley que prácticamente elimina las artes visuales del currículum escolar. También en otros países se está evidenciando un retroceso constante en materia de educación artística. Si el coronavirus está impulsando la práctica de las artes mediante el uso de tecnologías digitales, y la sociedad reivindica más enseñanzas en materia de prevención, salud, inclusión, igualdad, diversidad y lenguajes tecnológicos emergentes, deberíamos atender a estas necesidades que requiere el nuevo escenario educativo y vital. Ante tales evidencias, apostamos por una muerte digna de nuestra especialidad, tal y como la entendíamos hasta ahora, valorando que este derecho a la eutanasia supone el nacimiento de un concepto renovado de la educación artística, algo que deberemos abordar como prioridad y de manera inmediata.Alternate abstract:This year 2020 has marked by a global pandemic that causes a strange and unpredictable situation at the planetary level. All countries are in health prevention processes due to COVID-19, a virus that attacks the immune system. Trying to do any activity poses a risk of contagion, since the coronavirus spreads especially through human breath, which has led to the invasion of new daily habits, such as leaving the house with a mask, or not being able to meet other people for celebrations and events, or to teach in the classroom. Immersed in this unfavorable situation for any educational normality, in the case of artistic education we suffer doubly from this painful reality. In Spain, we started the year presenting a series of complaints to the new education law that the government wants to pass (LOMLOE), a law that practically eliminates the visual arts from the school curriculum. Also in other countries, there is a constant decline in Art Education as curricular teaching. If the coronavirus is promoting the use of digital technologies, and society claims the teachings on prevention, health, inclusion, equality, diversity and emerging technological languages, we should attend to the needs required by the new educational and vital scenario. Faced with such evidence, we are committed to a death worthy of our specialty, as we understood it until now, understanding that this right to euthanasia implies the birth of a renewed concept of artistic education, something that we must do immediately as a priority.","Huerta, Ricard Dominguez Ricardo",Educación Artística,,451

The aim of this study was to estimate the association between RWMA after exercise and in the presence of significant AR in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) or volume overload and to predict the eventual need for aortic valve replacement (AVR). METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively reviewed 182 patients with significant AR who underwent exercise echocardiography. In addition, we investigated patients with AR who underwent coronary angiography (CAG) or coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and were diagnosed with CAD. The presence of RWMA after exercise was defined as newly developed RWMA after exercise and included all changes in wall motion. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence of RWMA after exercise: the RWMA group (n = 42) and non-RWMA group (n = 140). In the RWMA group, 31 patients (73.8%) underwent coronary artery evaluation by CAG or CCTA. Only two patients in the RWMA group were diagnosed with current CAD and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients with RWMA were older (61.6 ± 10.8 vs 52.0 ± 13.7 years, P < .001), had more severe AR (54.8% vs 32.9%), and underwent AVR more frequently (40.5% vs 14.3%, P = .001) than patients without RWMA. METs (odds ratio [OR], 0.796; P = .019), difference between rest and postexercise left ventricular end-diastolic volume (OR, 0.967; P = .001), and the difference between pre- and postexercise left ventricular end-systolic volume (OR, 1.113; P < .001) were identified as independent factors associated with RWMA after exercise according to multivariable logistic regression analysis. The majority of wall motion changes were seen in the lateral and inferior segments, and the locations of wall motion changes were relatively consistent with the direction of the AR jet. The relationship between RWMA after exercise and time to AVR was investigated by simple linear regression (hazard ratio [HR], 3.402; P < .001). After adjusting for baseline parameters of diastolic blood pressure, left ventricular end-systolic dimension (LVESD), aorta size, deceleration time, and METs, the presence of RWMA after exercise was not predictive of time to AVR (HR, 1.106; P = .81). On the other hand, without forcible entry of RWMA after exercise, LVESD (HR, 1.119; P < .001) and METs (HR, 0.828; P = .006) independently predicted the eventual need for AVR as an outcome. CONCLUSION: The degree of change in wall motion from rest to exercise in those with significant AR was not correlated with CAD, but was correlated with the severity of volume overload and exercise-induced preload changes, as well as the direction of the AR jet. In addition, RWMA after exercise had no role in predicting the need for AVR.","Hwang, Ji-Won; Park, Sung-Ji; Kim, Eun Kyoung; Chang, Sung-A; Choi, Jin-Oh; Lee, Sang-Chol; Ahn, Joong Hyun; Carriere, Keumhee; Park, Seung Woo",Echocardiography,,451

This article first clarifies the definition of, and then provides an analytical framework for, a ‘strategic partnership’. The article then analyses how these countries laid the foundation of their strategic partnership and how they have since built upon that foundation. In the implementation process of the strategic partnership, this article examines three elements: 1) the consolidation of their strategic partnership in official documents; 2) the institutionalisation of regular meetings; and 3) participation in defence and security exercises. Although the Japan-New Zealand strategic partnership is still in the early stages, this article argues that it has the potential to grow further given bipartisan support and positive perceptions in civil society in both countries. This article also analyses three factors that exert an impact on the development of their strategic partnership: China’s continued assertive maritime presence, the rejuvenation of the US-New Zealand bilateral relationship, and Japan and New Zealand’s ongoing commitment to the South Pacific region.","Iwami, Tadashi",Pac.

Fake news and conspiracy theories are so prevalent that the World Health Organization started as early as February 2020 to use the term ""infodemic"". This paper is focused on the assessment of the prevalence of beliefs in conspiracy theories related to COVID-19 in Polish society. The association of support for conspiracy theories with sociodemographic variables, health literacy (HL) and eHealth literacy (eHL) was studied. The analysis reported here was based on the data from an online survey of a representative sample (n = 1002) of the adult population of Polish Internet users. The multivariate linear regression for the COVID-19-related conspiracy belief score (CCBS) and logistic regression models for the support of individual conspiracy theories was developed. The percentage of supporters of particular conspiracy theories in the study sample ranged from 43% to 56%. The CCBS was significantly associated with age, education level, vocational status and both HL and eHL. However, it was lower for persons with higher HL (regression coefficient (B) = -0.04, p < 0.001) but higher for those with higher eHL (B = 0.04, p = 0.038). The most influential predictors of CCBS were age (standardised regression coefficient (ß) = -0.21) and education level (ß from 0.08 to 0.16 for respondents with lower education levels and those with master's degrees). In conclusion, younger persons rather than older, those with a lower rather than with a higher level of education, employees rather than students and persons with lower rather than higher HL were more likely to believe the conspiracy theories. Surprisingly, contrary to expectations, higher eHL was significantly associated with greater belief in such theories.","Duplaga, Mariusz",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,451

444035,Relationship of SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic with Blood Groups,2021,"Taking pride in the vibrancy and transparency of democracy, countries such as the USA have prioritized the spread of democracy in its foreign policy. The admirable impact that this political agenda has garnered across the globe pushes us to ponder what China would offer as it aspires for a more prominent position on the international stage. Particularly, how would China foster its image in Asia and, as a result, earn a favorable voice and even all-out support from Asian countries, countries economically underdeveloped and politically volatile? This paper sets out to answer this question by critiquing whether or not popular perceptions of China's political system impact how Asians perceive China's influence in general. Conducting statistical analysis using the fourth wave of Asian Barometer Survey (2016) to assess the above argument, we find that Asians who lend their support for China are more keen to the economic opportunities that China's growing economy offers their country than they are of China's political system. In short, China's authoritarian regime type does not factor into Asians' perception of China, except when individuals are highly educated with and committed to democratic principles.","Xi, Jinrui; Primiano, Christopher",East Asia (Piscataway),,451
444255,SARS-CoV-2 Causes a Different Cytokine Response Compared to Other Cytokine Storm-Causing Respiratory Viruses in Severely Ill Patients,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell nephropathy begins in childhood and presents early increases in glomerular filtration, which, over the long term, can lead to chronic renal failure. Several diseases have increased circulating and urinary angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity, but there is little information about changes in ACEs activity in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). OBJECTIVE: We examined circulating and urinary ACE 1 activity in children with SCD. METHODS: This cross-sectional study compared children who were carriers of SCD with children who comprised a control group (CG). Serum and urinary activities of ACE were evaluated, as were biochemical factors, urinary album/creatinine rates, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. RESULTS: Urinary ACE activity was significantly higher in patients with SCD than in healthy children (median 0.01; range 0.00-0.07 vs median 0.00; range 0.00-0.01 mU/mL·creatinine, p < 0.001. No significant difference in serum ACE activities between the SCD and CG groups was observed (median 32.25; range 16.2-59.3 vs median 40.9; range 18.0-53.4) mU/m`L·creatinine, p < 0.05. CONCLUSION: Our data revealed a high urinary ACE 1 activity, different than plasmatic level, in SCD patients suggesting a dissociation between the intrarenal and systemic RAAS. The increase of urinary ACE 1 activity in SCD patients suggests higher levels of Ang II with a predominance of classical RAAS axis, that can induce kidney damage.","Hsien, Ho Chi; Casarini, Dulce Elena; Carvalhaes, João Tomas de Abreu; Ronchi, Fernanda Aparecida; Oliveira, Lilian Caroline Gonçalves de; Braga, Josefina Aparecida Pellegrini",J. bras. nefrol,,451

However, soon after the outbreak of COVID-19, Australia took an increasingly assertive stance toward China, one that is arguably even more assertive than those of its Western allies. What prompted Australia to adopt a tougher policy against China? This article argues that COVID-19 has brought significant uncertainty to the international system and, hence, to Australia's external environment, which has affected the country's decision-making, accelerating the formation of a hardline policy toward China. A contributing factor behind this policy is Australia's quest for ontological security, which, in the context of COVID-19, has triggered a rise in anti-China sentiment. Meanwhile, this strategy backfired when it encountered China's own nationalism, which exacerbated the widening political chasm, dragging the two countries into an unprecedented diplomatic confrontation. The core of ontological security lies in maintaining the stability of the identity needed for the formation of consistent policy. The uncertainties created by the COVID-19 pandemic have changed the familiar external environment and challenged Australia's ability to interpret this new environment and adjust to it, which has triggered ontological insecurity. By analyzing Australia's identity as a middle power in the context of changing regional security and its commitment to certain values, the article shows how COVID-19 has accelerated Australia's quest for ontological security, which has changed the country's China policy.","Pan, Guangyi; Korolev, Alexander",J Chin Polit Sci,,451

446145,Effectiveness of Mavrilimumab in viral infections including SARS-CoV-2 infection - A brief review,2021,"BACKGROUND: Renal involvement in severe or critical acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is frequent. Acute kidney injury (AKI) in African American (AA) kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) with COVID-19 is not well described. We report our experience with a predominantly AA cohort (79%) of KTRs with COVID-19 infections in the Detroit Metropolitan area. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, we identified 39 KTRs who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March 16 and April 25, 2020. Data from electronic medical records were retrieved and compared between KTRs without AKI and KTRs with AKI. RESULTS: One patient was excluded due to delayed graft function. Final analysis of AKI in KTRs with proven COVID-19 was done on 38 patients of which 30 were AA (79%). AKI occurred in 71.1% of COVID-19 KTRs (n = 27), of whom 6 (22.2%) patients required HD. The incidence of AKI in our cohort was 71% (27/38). AKI rate among AA was 76.7% versus 50% in non-AA cohort (P = 0.195). In a univariate logistic regression analysis, AA race was not significantly associated with AKI odds ratio (3.4; CI, 0.68-17.4; P = 0.14). After risk adjustment by race, patients with diabetes showed a significantly higher risk of AKI (adjusted odds ratio, 19.85; CI, 1.65-58.66; P = 0.012).

DESIGN: This is a retrospective study. A geriatric hospital-based team acted as a consultant and coordinated the care of older people living in NHs from the hospital. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 630 patients aged 70 and older with Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID-19 living in 55 NHs. METHODS: A logistic regression was performed to analyze the factors associated with mortality. In addition, Kaplan-Meier curves were applied according to mortality and its associated factors using the log-rank Mantel-Cox test. RESULTS: The diagnosis of COVID-19 was mainly made by clinical compatibility (N = 430). Median age was 87 years, 64.6% were women and 45.9% were transferred to be cared for at the hospital. A total of 282 patients died (44.7%) within the 30 days of first attention by the team. A severe form of COVID-19 occurred in 473 patients, and the most frequent symptoms were dyspnea (n = 332) and altered level of consciousness (n = 301). According to multiple logistic regression, male sex (P = .019), the Clinical Frailty Score (CFS) &#8805;6 (P = .004), dementia (P = .012), dyspnea (P < .001), and having a severe form of COVID-19 (P = .001), were associated with mortality, whereas age and care setting were not. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Mortality of the residents living in NHs with COVID-19 was almost 45%. The altered level of consciousness as an atypical presentation of COVID-19 should be considered in this population. A severe form of the disease, present in more than three-quarters of patients, was associated with mortality, apart from the male sex, CFS &#8805;6, dementia, and dyspnea, whereas age and care setting were not. These findings may also help to recognize patients in which the Advance Care Planning process is especially urgent to assist in the decisions about their care.","Bielza, Rafael; Sanz, Juan; Zambrana, Francisco; Arias, Estefanía; Malmierca, Eduardo; Portillo, Laura; Thuissard, Israel J; Lung, Ana; Neira, Marta; Moral, María; Andreu-Vázquez, Cristina; Esteban, Ana; Ramírez, Marcela Irma; González, Laura; Carretero, Guillermo; Moreno, Ricardo Vicente; Martínez, Pilar; López, Javier; Esteban-Ortega, Mar; García, Isabel; Vaquero, María Antonia; Linares, Ana; Gómez-Santana, Ana; Gómez Cerezo, Jorge",J Am Med Dir Assoc,,451

To date, no evidence exists to support improvement in oncologic outcomes with neoadjuvant therapy. Likewise, although targeted therapies have shown efficacy in tumor downsizing, this does not often translate to downstaging. Use of presurgical therapy for the purpose of downstaging inferior vena cava tumor thrombi is currently not supported.

446704,Bacterial and fungal infections among patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and associated response measures have led to unprecedented challenges for service providers working with vulnerable children and families around the world. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the present study was to better understand the impact of the pandemic and associated response measures on vulnerable children and families and provide data-informed recommendations for public and private service providers working with this population. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Representatives from 87 non-government organizations (NGOs) providing a variety of direct services (i.e. residential care, family preservation, foster care, etc.) to 454,637 vulnerable children and families in 43 countries completed a brief online survey. METHODS: Using a mixed methods design, results examined 1) ways in which children and families have been directly impacted by COVID-19, 2) the impact of the pandemic on services provided by NGOs, 3) government responses and gaps in services for this population during the pandemic, and 4) strategies that have been effective in filling these gaps. RESULTS: Data revealed that the pandemic and restrictive measures were associated with increased risk factors for vulnerable children and families, including not having access to vital services. The NGOs experienced government restrictions, decreased financial support, and inability to adequately provide services. Increased communication and supportive activities had a positive impact on both NGO staff and the families they serve. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings, ten recommendations were made for service providers working with vulnerable children and families during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wilke, Nicole Gilbertson; Howard, Amanda Hiles; Pop, Delia",Child Abuse Negl,,451

448599,Response to: towards the rational utilization of SARS-CoV-2 serological tests in clinical practice,2021,"INTRODUCTION: and Aims: No valid treatment or preventative strategy has evolved till date to counter the SARS CoV 2 (Novel Coronavirus) epidemic that originated in China in late 2019 and have since wrought havoc on millions across the world with illness, socioeconomic recession and death. This analysis was aimed at tracing a trend related to death counts expected at the 5th and 6th week of the COVID-19 in India. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Validated database was used to procure global and Indian data related to coronavirus and related outcomes. Multiple regression and linear regression analyses were used interchangeably. Since the week 6 death count data was not correlated significantly with any of the chosen inputs, an auto-regression technique was employed to improve the predictive ability of the regression model. RESULTS: A linear regression analysis predicted average week 5 death count to be 211 with a 95% CI: 1.31-2.60). Similarly, week 6 death count, in spite of a strong correlation with input variables, did not pass the test of statistical significance. Using auto-regression technique and using week 5 death count as input the linear regression model predicted week 6 death count in India to be 467, while keeping at the back of our mind the risk of over-estimation by most of the risk-based models. CONCLUSION: According to our analysis, if situation continue in present state; projected death rate (n) is 211 and467 at the end of the 5th and 6th week from now, respectively.","Ghosal, Samit; Sengupta, Sumit; Majumder, Milan; Sinha, Binayak",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,451
448832,SARS-CoV-2 Infection in the Central and Peripheral Nervous System-Associated Morbidities and Their Potential Mechanism,2021,"There is a worldwide interest in how lockdown affects physical activity (PA) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although it has been shown that the mandated stay-at-home restrictions and self-isolation measures applied in different countries were accosiated with a reduction in physical exercise and activity, such results derive from studying only specific periods of lockdown. However, in order for this hypothesis to be tested, consecutive lockdown periods need to be examined separately. In this study we focus on PA change in Greek adults over time, during each of the last four weeks of lockdown in Greece. The web-based Active-Q questionnaire (see Supplementary file 1_Active-Q) was used to collect data prior to the COVID-19 crisis (PRE condition) and during lockdown measures (POST condition). The period of data collection (5 April to 3 May 2020) was divided into four phases (Ph-I, Ph-II, Ph-III, Ph-V), corresponding to the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th lockdown week respectively (out of a six-week total lockdown). There were four independent groups of respondents (G-I, G-II, G-III, G-V) who reported their age, weight, height and usual PA habits. Energy expenditure (EE) was calculated (MET-min/week; see Supplementary file 2_Data) in four main different domains (daily occupation activities, means of transportation to and from daily occupation, leisure time and regular sporting activities; see Supplementary file 3_Corresponding MET values). Each group's dataset corresponded to one of the aforementioned phases (G-I to Ph-I, G-II to Ph-II, and so on). Overall PA change (from PRE to POST condition) ranged from -21.50% in G-I (Ph-I) to -5.03 in G-V (Ph-V); PA change in male subgroups ranged from -26.10% in Ph-I to -13.64 in Ph-V; in female subgroups it ranged from -17.42% in Ph-I to -1.39 in Ph-V. Although the decline in overall PA is evident in all groups during each lockdown phase (p<0.05), the combination of our data demonstrates that towards the end of lockdown this decline showed a gradual decreasing tendency.","Bourdas, Dimitrios I; Zacharakis, Emmanouil D",Data Brief,,451

These devices are widely used in disinfection, sterilization, water purification, medical devices, in plant lighting and as insect traps;moreover, UV antiviral treatments are being developed recently, under the push of the current COVID-19 emergency. We analyzed the behavior of the devices during a constant current stress at the current of 250 mA, through electrical (I-V), optical (L-I) and spectral (PSD) measurements and steady state photocapacitance (SSPC) analysis. By investigating the optical measurements, we found out the presence of two different degradation mechanisms, one before 1000 min of stress and one after 1000 min of stress. We ascribed the first one to a decrease in the injection efficiency and we modeled it with a system of three differential rate equations to describe the dynamics of the de-hydrogenation of gallium vacancies, that lead to a defects generation. On the other hand, the second degradation mechanism is well correlated to the generation of midgap defects (Ec-2.15 eV), as detected from the SSPC analysis, that indicates the generation of non-radiative centers induced by the stress. © 2021 SPIE.","Piva, F.; De Santi, C.; Buffolo, M.; Deki, M.; Kushimoto, M.; Amano, H.; Tomozawa, H.; Shibata, N.; Meneghesso, G.; Zanoni, E.; Meneghini, M.",Gallium Nitride Materials and Devices XVI 2021,,451
449964,Strongyloides infection manifested during immunosuppressive therapy for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia,2020,"Meat cultivation via cellular agriculture holds great promise as a method for future food production. In theory, it is an ideal way of meat production, humane to the animals and sustainable for the environment, while keeping the same taste and nutritional values as traditional meat and having additional benefits such as controlled fat content and absence of antibiotics and hormones used in the traditional meat industry. However, in practice, there is still a number of challenges, such as those associated with the upscale of cultured meat (CM). CM food safety monitoring is a necessary factor when envisioning both the regulatory compliance and consumer acceptance. To achieve this, a multidisciplinary approach is necessary. This includes extensive development of the sensitive and specific analytical devices i.e., sensors to enable reliable food safety monitoring throughout the whole future food supply chain. In addition, advanced monitoring options can help in the further optimization of the meat cultivation which may reduce the currently still high costs of production. This review presents an overview of the sensor monitoring options for the most relevant parameters of importance for meat cultivation. Examples of the various types of sensors that can potentially be used in CM production are provided and the options for their integration into bioreactors, as well as suggestions on further improvements and more advanced integration approaches. In favor of the multidisciplinary approach, we also include an overview of the bioreactor types, scaffolding options as well as imaging techniques relevant for CM research. Furthermore, we briefly present the current status of the CM research and related regulation, societal aspects and challenges to its upscaling and commercialization.","Djisalov, Mila; Knezic, Teodora; Podunavac, Ivana; Zivojevic, Kristina; Radonic, Vasa; Knezevic, Nikola Z; Bobrinetskiy, Ivan; Gadjanski, Ivana",,,451

Different types of social policy programs have been combined and synthesized, including social insurance, social assistance, and social welfare arrangements. Facing the challenges of the new risks caused by the pandemic, the collaboration of the Chinese state and intermediary social welfare organizations has played a crucial role in providing both cash benefits and social services (benefits in kind). For the first time, social policy in China has acted as a major player for coping with the negative outcomes of a pandemic.

Inference about the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 can provide important insights into the speed of disease spread and the effects of mitigation policies. We develop a novel Bayesian approach to such inference based on a probabilistic compartmental model using data of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases. In particular, we consider a probabilistic extension of the classical susceptible-infectious-recovered model, which takes into account undocumented infections and allows the epidemiological parameters to vary over time. We estimate the disease transmission rate via a Gaussian process prior, which captures nonlinear changes over time without the need of specific parametric assumptions. We utilize a parallel-tempering Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to efficiently sample from the highly correlated posterior space. Predictions for future observations are done by sampling from their posterior predictive distributions. Performance of the proposed approach is assessed using simulated datasets. Finally, our approach is applied to COVID-19 data from four states of the United States: Washington, New York, California, and Illinois.

All genotypes were grown at the same location under the same field conditions and were fed to growing castrated crossbred pigs (initial body weight: 31.1 ± 6.95 kg) using a series of duplicate 3 × 3 Latin square designs. A basal ration, which was deficient in P, and 32 experimental rations containing 400 g/kg DM of the basal ration and 600 g/kg DM of the corresponding cereal grain were mixed. Pigs were kept in metabolism crates and the total collection method was used for separate faeces and urine collections with 7-d adaptation and 7-d collection periods. The mean ATTD of P was greater (p < 0.05) for wheat than for triticale, rye or barley (59.4%, 50.4%, 44.9% and 44.4%, respectively, for the mean of each grain species). Within-grain species differences (p < 0.05) among genotypes were obtained for ATTD of P of barley and triticale. The concentrations of ME of triticale and wheat were higher (p < 0.05) than that of barley and rye (16.1 and 16.2 vs. 14.9 and 14.8 MJ ME/kg DM, respectively). Differences in ME concentration among genotypes within a grain species (p < 0.05) were found for barley, triticale and wheat. No differences were found for rye. Compared to literature data the present study showed, in part, considerable differences in ATTD of P and ME concentration. These results should be taken into account for accurate pig ration formulation with regard to minimised P output and efficient use of ME. No significant relationships were detected between ATTD of P and phytic acid concentration or phytase activity in the grain genotypes in this study.","Schemmer, Ralph; Spillner, Claudia; Südekum, Karl-Heinz",Arch Anim Nutr,,451

Primary care (PC) nurses render first line care, or refer for more specialised services. AIM: To investigate the preparedness of PC nurses for COVID-19 in the Western Cape. SETTING: The Western Cape province of South Africa. METHODS: We administered an online survey, with closed and open-ended questions, to 83 Stellenbosch University postgraduate PC nursing students and alumni working in the Western Cape, between 03 July and 01 September 2020. RESULTS: The results indicated that 43.3% of participants were confident about the infection, prevention, and control (IPC) training they received and 56.7% felt prepared to provide direct care to suspected cases of COVID-19. Primary care nurses were more comfortable to triage (78.3%) than to manage persons with COVID-19 (42.2%), indicating that they may not be functioning to the full capacity of their education and training. Adequate infrastructure was reported by less than a third of the participants (30.1%) and 59.1% reported that personal protective equipment (PPE) was always available. Primary care nurses needed support in coping with stress (57.8%) although few (14.5%) reported access to mental health services. CONCLUSION: Primary care nurses were not prepared optimally for the COVID-19 pandemic. Challenges included adequate training, infrastructure, the availability of personal protective equipment, COVID-19 testing of health care workers and management support. Primary care nurses need comprehensive support to manage stress and anxiety.","Crowley, Talitha; Kitshoff, Danine; De Lange-Cloete, Frances; Baron, Justine; De Lange, Santel; Young, Cornelle; Esterhuizen, Tonya; Couper, Ian",Afr J Prim Health Care Fam Med,,451

459444,Chinese herbal medicine: Fighting SARS-CoV-2 infection on all fronts,2021,"PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread to all countries in the world, and different countries have been impacted differently. The study aims to understand what factors contribute to different COVID-19 impacts at the country level. METHODS: Multivariate statistical analyses were used to evaluate COVID-19 deaths and cases relative to nine other demographic and socioeconomic factors in all countries and regions of the world using data as of August 1, 2020. The factors analyzed in the study include a country's total COVID-19 deaths and cases per million population, per capita gross domestic product (GDP), population density, virus tests per million population, median age, government response stringency index, hospital beds availability per thousand population, extreme poverty rate, Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination rate, and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP3) immunization rate. RESULTS: The study reveals that COVID-19 deaths per million population in a country most significantly correlates, inversely, with the country's BCG vaccination rate (r = - 0.50, p = 5.3e-5), and also significantly correlates a country's per capita GDP (r = 0.39, p = 7.4e-3) and median age (r = 0.30, p = 0.042), while COVID-19 cases per million population significantly correlate with per capita GDP and tests per thousand population. To control for possible confounding effects of age, the correlation was assessed in countries propensity score matched for age. The inverse correlation between BCG vaccination rates and COVID-19 case (r = - 0.30, p = 0.02) and death (r = - 0.42, p = 0.0007) remained significant among the top 61 countries with the highest median age. CONCLUSION: This study contributes to a growing body of evidence supporting the notion that BCG vaccination may be protective against COVID-19 mortality.","Li, Willis X",Infection,,451

APPROACH & RESULTS: This was a territory-wide retrospective cohort study in Hong Kong. COVID-19 patients between 23 January 2020 and 1 January 2021 were identified. Patients with hepatitis C or no hepatitis B surface antigen results were excluded. The primary outcome was mortality. Acute liver injury was defined as alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase &#8805;2x upper limit of normal (ULN) (i.e. 80U/L), with total bilirubin &#8805;2xULN (i.e. 2.2mg/dL) and/or international normalized ratio &#8805;1.7. Of 5,639 patients included, 353 (6.3%) and 359 (6.4%) had current and past HBV infection, respectively. Compared to patients without known HBV exposure, current HBV-infected patients were older, and more likely to have cirrhosis. Past HBV-infected patients were the oldest, and more had diabetes and cardiovascular disease. At a median follow-up of 14 (9-20) days, 138 (2.4%) patients died; acute liver injury occurred in 58 (1.2%), 8 (2.3%), and 11 (3.1%) patients with no, current, and past HBV infection, respectively. Acute liver injury (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.45, 95% CI 1.52-3.96, P<0.001), but not current (aHR 1.29, 95% CI 0.61-2.70, P=0.507) or past HBV infection (aHR 0.90, 95% CI 0.56-1.46, P=0.681), was associated with mortality. Corticosteroid, antifungal, ribavirin, and lopinavir-ritonavir use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] ranged from 2.55-5.63), but not current (aOR 1.93, 95% CI 0.88-4.24, P=0.102) or past HBV infection (aOR 1.25, 95% CI 0.62-2.55, P=0.533), were associated with acute liver injury.

462500,Re: 'Rapid point-of-care testing for SARS-CoV-2 in a community screening setting shows low sensitivity',2020,"BACKGROUND: While emergency physicians are familiar with the management of hypoxemic respiratory failure, management of mechanical ventilation and advanced therapies for oxygenation in the emergency department have become essential during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We review the current evidence on hypoxemia in COVID-19 and place it in the context of known evidence-based management of hypoxemic respiratory failure in the emergency department. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 causes mortality primarily through the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with hypoxemia arising from shunt, a mismatch of ventilation and perfusion. Management of patients developing ARDS should focus on mitigating derecruitment and avoiding volutrauma or barotrauma. CONCLUSIONS: High flow nasal cannula and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation have a more limited role in COVID-19 because of the risk of aerosolization and minimal benefit in severe cases, but can be considered. Stable patients who can tolerate repositioning should be placed in a prone position while awake. Once intubated, patients should be managed with ventilation strategies appropriate for ARDS, including targeting lung-protective volumes and low pressures. Increasing positive end-expiratory pressure can be beneficial. Inhaled pulmonary vasodilators do not decrease mortality but may be given to improve refractory hypoxemia. Prone positioning of intubated patients is associated with a mortality reduction in ARDS and can be considered for patients with persistent hypoxemia. Neuromuscular blockade should also be administered in patients who remain dyssynchronous with the ventilator despite adequate sedation. Finally, patients with refractory severe hypoxemic respiratory failure in COVID-19 should be considered for venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.","Wilcox, Susan R; Condella, Anna",J. emerg. med,,451
462772,Distinct Infection Forms of SARS-CoV-2 Among People Living With HIV,2021,"BACKGROUND: During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, harsh social distancing measures were taken in China to contain viral spread. We examined their impact on the lives of medical students. METHODS: A nation-wide cross-sectional survey of college students was conducted from 4-12 February 2020. We enrolled medical students studying public health in Beijing and Wuhan to assess their COVID-19 awareness and to evaluate their mental health status/behaviors using a self-administered questionnaire. We used the Patient Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and Health Questionnaire-9 to measure anxiety disorders and depression. We used multivariable logistic regression and path analysis to assess the associations between covariates and anxiety disorder/depression. RESULTS: Of 933 students, 898 (96.2%) reported wearing masks frequently when going out, 723 (77.5%) reported daily handwashing with soap, 676 (72.5%) washed hands immediately after arriving home, and 914 (98.0%) reported staying home as much as possible. Prevalence of anxiety disorder was 17.1% and depression was 25.3%. Multivariable logistic regression showed anxiety to be associated with graduate student status (odds ratio (aOR) = 2.0; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2-3.5), negative thoughts or actions (aOR = 1.6; 95% CI: 1.4-1.7), and feeling depressed (aOR = 6.8; 95% CI: 4.0-11.7). Beijing students were significantly less likely to have anxiety than those in the Wuhan epicenter (aOR = 0.9; 95% CI: 0.8-1.0), but depression did not differ. Depression was associated with female students (aOR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.2-3.3), negative thoughts or actions (aOR = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.5-1.9), and anxiety disorder (aOR = 5.8; 95% CI: 3.4-9.9). Path analysis validated these same predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Despite medical students' knowledge of disease control and prevention, their lives were greatly affected by social distancing, especially in the Wuhan epicenter. Even well-informed students needed psychological support during these extraordinarily stressful times.","Xiao, Huidi; Shu, Wen; Li, Menglong; Li, Ziang; Tao, Fangbiao; Wu, Xiaoyan; Yu, Yizhen; Meng, Heng; Vermund, Sten H; Hu, Yifei",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,451

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to close contacts in different settings. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Close contacts of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Guangzhou, China. PARTICIPANTS: 3410 close contacts of 391 index cases were traced between 13 January and 6 March 2020. Data on the setting of the exposure, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing, and clinical characteristics of index and secondary cases were collected. Measurement: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases were confirmed by guidelines issued by China. Secondary attack rates in different settings were calculated. RESULTS: Among 3410 close contacts, 127 (3.7% [95% CI, 3.1% to 4.4%]) were secondarily infected. Of these 127 persons, 8 (6.3% [CI, 2.1% to 10.5%]) were asymptomatic. Of the 119 symptomatic cases, 20 (16.8%) were defined as mild, 87 (73.1%) as moderate, and 12 (10.1%) as severe or critical. Compared with the household setting (10.3%), the secondary attack rate was lower for exposures in healthcare settings (1.0%; odds ratio [OR], 0.09 [CI, 0.04 to 0.20]) and on public transportation (0.1%; OR, 0.01 [CI, 0.00 to 0.08]). The secondary attack rate increased with the severity of index cases, from 0.3% (CI, 0.0 to 1.0%) for asymptomatic to 3.3% (CI, 1.8% to 4.8%) for mild, 5.6% (CI, 4.4% to 6.8%) for moderate, and 6.2% (CI, 3.2% to 9.1%) for severe or critical cases. Index cases with expectoration were associated with higher risk for secondary infection (13.6% vs. 3.0% for index cases without expectoration; OR, 4.81 [CI, 3.35 to 6.93]). LIMITATION: There was potential recall bias regarding symptom onset among patients with COVID-19, and the symptoms and severity of index cases were not assessed at the time of exposure to contacts. CONCLUSION: Household contact was the main setting for transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and the risk for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among close contacts increased with the severity of index cases.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA has been detected in stool samples of approximately 50% of COVID-19 individuals. Fecal calprotectin is a marker of gastrointestinal inflammation in the general population. AIM: To investigate if fecal calprotectin correlates with SARS-CoV-2 intestinal shedding in COVID-19 patients with pneumonia. METHODS: Patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia admitted to the Infectious Disease Unit (University Hospital of Trieste, Italy) from September to November 2020 were consecutively enrolled in the study. Fecal samples were collected and analyzed for quantification of fecal calprotectin (normal value < 50 mg/kg) and SARS-CoV-2 RNA presence by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Inter-group differences were determined between patients with and without diarrhea and patients with and without detection of fecal SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: We enrolled 51 adults (40 males) with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Ten patients (20%) presented with diarrhea. Real-time-PCR of SARS-CoV-2 in stools was positive in 39 patients (76%), in all patients with diarrhea (100%) and in more than two thirds (29/41, 71%) of patients without diarrhea. Obesity was one of the most common comorbidities (13 patients, 25%); all obese patients (100%) (P = 0.021) tested positive for fecal SARS-CoV-2. Median fecal calprotectin levels were 60 mg/kg [interquartile range (IQR) 21; 108]; higher fecal calprotectin levels were found in the group with SARS-CoV-2 in stools (74 mg/kg, IQR 29; 132.5) compared to the group without SARS-CoV-2 (39 mg/kg, IQR 14; 71) (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: High fecal calprotectin levels among COVID-19 patients correlate with SARS-CoV-2 detection in stools supporting the hypothesis that this virus can lead to bowel inflammation and potentially to the 'leaky gut' syndrome.","Zerbato, Verena; Di Bella, Stefano; Giuffrè, Mauro; Jaracz, Anna Wladyslawa; Gobbo, Ylenia; Luppino, Diego; Macor, Paolo; Segat, Ludovica; Koncan, Raffaella; D039,; Agaro, Pierlanfranco; Valentini, Michael; Crocé, Lory Saveria; Ruscio, Maurizio; Luzzati, Roberto",World J Gastroenterol,,451

469249,Unknown SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia detected by PET/CT in patients with cancer,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 disease emerged in Wuhan province of China in November 2019 and spread across the world in a short time, resulting in a pandemic. The first case in Turkey was detected on March 11, 2020. The aim of the current study was to reveal the effects of COVID-19 on cranial nerves by monitoring people infected with the disease based on repeated examinations and surveys. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The data of 356 patients with a positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test who received treatment between June 2020 and August 2020 in our hospital were prospectively evaluated after the study was approved by the relevant ethics committee. RESULTS: Of the 356 patients included in the study, 47 under the age of 18 years were excluded due to their unreliable examination and anamnesis findings. In addition, seven patients that died while in hospital were excluded from the study due to the lack of examination and survey records during their hospitalization. The data of the remaining 302 patients were statistically analyzed. Symptoms of cranial nerve involvement were observed in 135 patients. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV2 virus commonly results in cranial nerve symptoms. The fact that these findings are more common and severe in COVID-19 than previous SARS and MERS outbreaks suggests that it has a more neurotrophic and more aggressive neuroinvasion. While the negative effects of the virus on sensory functions resulting from cranial nerve involvement are evident, motor functions are rarely affected.","Doblan, Ahmet; Kaplama, Mehmet Erkan; Ak, Semih; Basmaci, Nazli; Tarini, Emine Zeynep; Göktas, Seniz Engür; Güler, Süleyman; Müderris, Togay",Am J Otolaryngol,,451
469352,The rise of point-of-care genetics: how the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will accelerate adoption of genetic testing in the acute setting,2021,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 virus changed society's behaviour. Population was advised to reduce unnecessary heath care use to accommodate urgent cases and daily increase of COVID-19 patients. Health care facilities faced huge challenges, having to readjust their response to preserve good quality of care. In Portugal, a significant reduction in the number of admissions to the Emergency Department (ED) was reported all over the country, however the impact on the dynamics of undeferrable surgery remains to be reported. This study compares the volume and characteristics of urgent/emergency surgery during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic with the homologous period in 2019, chronologically illustrating the national evolution of new COVID-19 cases and the social and hospital containment response. Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted in a tertiary hospital center located in the most affected region by COVID-19 in Portugal. Medical records of patients who underwent urgent/emergency surgery between March 1st and May 2nd of both 2020 and 2019 were examined and the volume of surgeries were compared. Also, daily national updates from Portuguese Directorate-General for Health were analysed. Results: During the COVID-19 pandemic approximately 30% less patients underwent urgent/emergency surgery (99%CI = 0.18-0.61, p < 0.001). Waiting time for surgery showed no difference between both years (p = 0.068), but patients who did surgery during the 2020 pandemic had higher mortality rates than the ones who did it in 2019 (11.4% in 2020 and 5.9% in 2019, p = 0.001). Reduction in surgery volume was correlated with the increasing number of infected cases nationally. Conclusion: This study demonstrates decreasing numbers of urgent/emergency procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic that may be justified by the national growth number of infected cases. Preoperative mass screening strategy was implemented without compromising the efficiency of surgical service, but patients' mortality was higher. The importance of visiting the ED during COVID-19 pandemic for serious cases that cannot be managed in other settings should be highlighted.","Sá, Andreia Filipa; Lourenço, Sofia Fonseca; Teixeira, Rafael da Silva; Barros, Filinto; Costa, António; Lemos, Paulo",Braz J Anesthesiol,,451

In patients with COVID-19, multiple cardiovascular (CV) manifestations have been reported. SARS coronavirus 2 infection can lead to inflammatory CV disease first via takeover of the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 enzyme as a cell receptor as well as the macrophage activation syndrome in severe illness. We review the CV manifestations of COVID-19 and therapeutics under investigation. We discuss the potential long-term CV sequelae after recovery from COVID-19 and the gaps in knowledge including the pathophysiological links between acute cardiac injury, myocardial inflammation and chronic cardiomyopathy. Future investigational efforts could result in significant diagnostic and therapeutic advances potentially impacting the broader field of chronic heart failure and cardiac recovery.","Shah, Kevin S; Hale Hammond, Mary Elizabeth; Drakos, Stavros G; Anderson, Jeffrey L; Fang, James C; Knowlton, Kirk U; Shaw, Robin M",Future cardiol,,451

470280,Immune characteristics distinguish patients with severe disease associated with SARS-CoV-2,2020,"BACKGROUND: Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a concern over possible increase in antibiotic use due to co-infections among COVID-19 patients in the community. Here, we evaluate the changes in nationwide use of broad-spectrum antibiotics during the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea. METHODS: We obtained national reimbursement data on the prescription of antibiotics, including penicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitors, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and macrolides. We examined the number of antibiotic prescriptions compared with the previous three years in the same period from August to July. To quantify the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on antibiotic use, we developed a regression model adjusting for changes of viral acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) which are an important factor driving antibiotic use. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea, the broad-spectrum antibiotic use dropped by 15%-55% compared to the previous 3 years. Overall reduction in antibiotic use adjusting for ARTIs was estimated to be 14%-30%, with a larger impact in children. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that broad-spectrum antibiotic use was substantially reduced during the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea. This reduction can be in part due to reduced ARTIs as a result of stringent public health interventions including social distancing measures.","Ryu, Sukhyun; Hwang, Youngsik; Ali, Sheikh Taslim; Kim, Dong-Sook; Klein, Eili Y; Lau, Eric H Y; Cowling, Benjamin J",J. infect. dis,,451

El objetivo del artículo es analizar las medidas para enfrentar la pandemia en países de la Región y el rol de la Atención Primaria de Salud, discutiendo obstáculos y potencialidades. Son analizados los casos de Bolivia, Brasil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Uruguay y Venezuela. Los siete países adoptaran medidas de aislamiento social de diferentes alcances, con grados distintos de sostenibilidad. El énfasis de las respuestas estuvo más en la atención hospitalaria que en la vigilancia de la salud, identificación de casos y contactos y disposición de condiciones adecuadas para el confinamiento. En casi todos los países, se subestimó la capacidad de los servicios de atención primária en el territorio. No obstante, iniciativas de enfoque territorial y comunitario buscaron integrar la vigilancia de la salud con actividades de promoción, prevención y cuidado, aunque con alcance parcial. En este contexto la Atención Primaria Integral e integrada toma nuevo sentido y reclama desarrollos que contribuyan a recobrar el equilibrio entre sociedad y medio ambiente.

On account of recent subarachnoidal haemorrhage the patient was a resident of a care facility, and was also being treated for acute bronchitis there. Radiographic imaging of the lungs revealed a tooth with crown and pontic to have been inhaled. The tooth was surgically removed. After 3 weeks in the intensive care unit, the patient died of aspiration pneumonia. Spontaneous tooth aspiration is rare, yet it can have fatal consequences in vulnerable older patients. Aspiration of a foreign body may lead to injury and infection of the trachea and lungs. In order to determine the correct diagnosis in patients with acute respiratory distress, adequate and targeted diagnostics is essential; especially in older patients with multimorbidity and polypharmacy. Sarcopenia, dysphagia, a decrease in functional chewing units and decreased sensation of the palate increase the risk of choking in patients. In addition, dysphagia and poor oral health are known to be strongly associated with aspiration pneumonia.

METHODS: Between March 2020 and May 2020, patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in the ICU were enrolled in this study. Upon discharge, patients were telephoned and asked to complete a survey related to taste and smell impairment. Characteristics were compared between patients with and without taste and/or smell impairment. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients were enrolled (mean age, 61.32 ± 12.53 years; mean ICU stay, 10.19 ± 10.24 days). Age, sex, type/number of comorbid diseases, most ICU support modalities, and ICU stay duration did not significantly differ between groups. Patients in group B required more high-flow nasal oxygen therapy than patients in group A (P = .010). In total, 22 (42.3%) of 52 patients experienced taste and/or smell impairment. Three patients experienced isolated smell impairment and one patient experienced isolated taste impairment. Among the 21 patients who experienced smell impairment, 18 (85.78%) experienced hyposmia (mean visual analog scale [VAS] score: 6.33 ± 0.97), while 3 (14.28%) experienced anosmia. Among the 19 patients who experienced taste impairment, 16 (84.22%) experienced hypogeusia (mean VAS score: 6.43 ± 1.03) and 3 (15.78%) experienced ageuisa. Among 22 patients who experienced taste and/or smell impairment, 15 (68.18%) patients (n = 15/22) experienced smell and/or taste impairment before the ICU stay, while 7 (31.82%) patients (n = 7/22) experienced impairment during the ICU stay. Overall, 28.84% (n = 15/52) of the patients experienced taste and/or smell impairment before the ICU stay. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who were hospitalized in the ICU experienced lower rates of taste and/or smell impairment. Some patients experienced taste and/or smell impairment during the ICU stay.","Sayin, Pinar; Altinay, Mustafa; Cinar, Ayse Surhan; Ozdemir, Haci Mustafa",Ear Nose Throat J,,451

482453,"Atypical symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 test results and immunisation rates in 456 residents from eight nursing homes facing a COVID-19 outbreak",2021,"The recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the global health crisis of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. No evidence is yet available for CoV infection into hosts upon zoonotic disease outbreak, although the CoV epidemy resembles influenza viruses, which use sialic acid (SA). Currently, information on SARS-CoV-2 and its receptors is limited. O-acetylated SAs interact with the lectin-like spike glycoprotein of SARS CoV-2 for the initial attachment of viruses to enter into the host cells. SARS-CoV-2 hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) acts as the classical glycan-binding lectin and receptor-degrading enzyme. Most ß-CoVs recognize 9-O-acetyl-SAs but switched to recognizing the 4-O-acetyl-SA form during evolution of CoVs. Type I HE is specific for the 9-O-Ac-SAs and type II HE is specific for 4-O-Ac-SAs. The SA-binding shift proceeds through quasi-synchronous adaptations of the SA-recognition sites of the lectin and esterase domains. The molecular switching of HE acquisition of 4-O-acetyl binding from 9-O-acetyl SA binding is caused by protein-carbohydrate interaction (PCI) or lectin-carbohydrate interaction (LCI). The HE gene was transmitted to a ß-CoV lineage A progenitor by horizontal gene transfer from a 9-O-Ac-SA-specific HEF, as in influenza virus C/D. HE acquisition, and expansion takes place by cross-species transmission over HE evolution. This reflects viral evolutionary adaptation to host SA-containing glycans. Therefore, CoV HE receptor switching precedes virus evolution driven by the SA-glycan diversity of the hosts. The PCI or LCI stereochemistry potentiates the SA-ligand switch by a simple conformational shift of the lectin and esterase domains. Therefore, examination of new emerging viruses can lead to better understanding of virus evolution toward transitional host tropism. A clear example of HE gene transfer is found in the BCoV HE, which prefers 7,9-di-O-Ac-SAs, which is also known to be a target of the bovine torovirus HE. A more exciting case of such a switching event occurs in the murine CoVs, with the example of the ß-CoV lineage A type binding with two different subtypes of the typical 9-O-Ac-SA (type I) and the exclusive 4-O-Ac-SA (type II) attachment factors. The protein structure data for type II HE also imply the virus switching to binding 4-O acetyl SA from 9-O acetyl SA. Principles of the protein-glycan interaction and PCI stereochemistry potentiate the SA-ligand switch via simple conformational shifts of the lectin and esterase domains. Thus, our understanding of natural adaptation can be specified to how carbohydrate/glycan-recognizing proteins/molecules contribute to virus evolution toward host tropism. Under the current circumstances where reliable antiviral therapeutics or vaccination tools are lacking, several trials are underway to examine viral agents. As expected, structural and non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are currently being targeted for viral therapeutic designation and development. However, the modern global society needs SARS-CoV-2 preventive and therapeutic drugs for infected patients. In this review, the structure and sialobiology of SARS-CoV-2 are discussed in order to encourage and activate public research on glycan-specific interaction-based drug creation in the near future.","Kim, Cheorl-Ho",,,451

Lockdown with effective closure of all services including routine health care services has tested the nerves of health care providers for finding novel ways of providing services without getting into the risk of exposure. Telemedicine had been an ideal option for such situations allowing all channels of communication that leverage Information Technology platforms, including voice, audio, text and digital data exchange as a help to diagnosis, prescription and follow up evaluation. Unfortunately this versatility of Telemedicine as a patient -physician interface could not be harnessed well for its technical complexities and unpreparedness of institutions and individuals. Smartphone based video calling using whatsapp messenger has been proposed as a feasible Telemedicine application to provide outpatient services in this scenario. A pilot run of outpatient services during lockdown period through whatsapp facilitated video calling at Ayurveda Gathiya Clinic, State Ayurvedic College and Hospital, Lucknow has shown a way forward of running such services with a mass appeal, ease of operation and high interface gratification among users and service providers. Within its limitations related to the quality and quantity of information sought, this comes as a viable method of patient -physician interfacing during the phase of lockdown.","Rastogi, Sanjeev; Singh, Neelendra; Pandey, Preeti",,,451
484931,Natural resources to control COVID-19: could lactoferrin amend SARS-CoV-2 infectivity?,2021,"As of March 2021, three COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United States. Each has substantial efficacy in preventing COVID-19. However, as efficacy from trials was <100% for all three vaccines, disease in vaccinated people is expected to occur. We created a spreadsheet-based tool to estimate the number of symptomatic vaccine breakthrough infections based on published vaccine efficacy (VE) data, percent of the population that has been fully vaccinated, and average number of COVID-19 cases reported per day. We estimate that approximately 51,000 symptomatic vaccine breakthrough infections (95% CI: [~]48,000-55,000 cases) occurred in the United States during January-April 2021 among >77 million fully vaccinated people, reflecting <0.5% of COVID-19 cases that occurred during that time. With ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and increasing numbers of people vaccinated in the United States, vaccine breakthrough infections will continue to accumulate before population immunity is sufficient to interrupt transmission. Understanding expectations regarding number of vaccine breakthrough infections enables accurate public health messaging to help ensure that the occurrence of such cases does not negatively affect vaccine perceptions, confidence, and uptake.","Kugeler, Kiersten J; Williamson, John; Curns, Aaron; Healy, Jessica M; Nolen, Leisha D; Clark, Thomas A; Martin, Stacey W; Fischer, Marc",,,451

485424,Comparative sensitivity of different respiratory specimen types for molecular diagnosis and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 shedding in COVID-19 patients,2020,"Due to the close relationship between the incidence of infectious diseases by epidemics and environmental conditions, this research explores the temperature, evaporation, precipitation and regional climate effects on the local transmission of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 inside 31 states and capital of Mexico since February 29 (national onset) to March 31, 2020. Statistical analysis was conducted to explore the association between the daily local COVID-19 confirmed positive cases (LCPC) and both climate characteristics and the daily weather reported by the regional meteorological stations. In this work, the local transmission ratio (LTR) was calculated with the regional LCPC divided by the number of the effective contagion days since regional onset in each state. The results showed a negative association between temperature (mean, max and min) and climate classification with both LCPC and LTR variables. The precipitation associated positively with LCPC and LTR. The associations between the climate classification with LCPC and LTR are statistically significant. The tropical climate (mean temperature around 25.95â¯°C and mean precipitation around 8.74â¯mm) delayed the regional onset. However, the regional onset in dry climates emerged earlier as consequence of the lower temperatures and higher precipitations (20.57â¯°C and 20.87â¯mm respectively) than the observed in the tropical climate. The fastest regional onsets were observed in tempered climates in states where the lowest temperatures and lowest precipitations were registered (19.65â¯°C and 8.48â¯mm respectively). Meteorological factors influenced the trend on the regional outbreaks in Mexican's states likely by the host predisposition and susceptibility during the cold winter season. In Mexico, the climate characteristics played a crucial role on the local infection during the phase 1 being the tempered regions (as Michoacán, Jalisco, Puebla, etc.) more vulnerable than the dry (as Chihuahua, Durango or Zacatecas, etc.) or tropical areas (as Colima, Campeche, Morelos etc.).","Méndez-Arriaga, Fabiola",Sci Total Environ,,451
485851,RNA-seq Reveals the Increased Risk of Heart and Cardiovascular Disease by SARS-CoV-2 Infection,2021,"In the context of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, patients affected by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) should be more vulnerable to Covid-19, whereas they seem to be protected against severe Covid-19. That paradox has important practical implications for the use of the drug Tocilizumab in Covid-19. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) orchestrates the so-called cytokine storm leading to the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), the life-threatening condition that is responsible for Covid-19 deaths. However, IL-6 has a paradoxical effect in many viral infections. For pathogens such as HIV and Hepatitis B for example, high elevations show a toxic effect and are associated with higher mortality (e.g. they promote progression to AIDS in HIV patients), whereas mild elevations show a protective effect. IL-6 can be therefore considered as being both a pro-inflammatory and an anti-inflammatory cytokine. Several studies have shown that severe COPD is associated with extremely-high levels of IL-6, whereas mild COPD is associated with mild elevations of IL-6. It is plausible that the chronic, mildly-elevated concentrations of IL-6 found in mild COPD patients is protective against the deterioration of Covid-19, as it is the case for other viral diseases. That may explain why COPD is surprisingly an uncommon comorbidity in Covid-19 intensive care units. This may have an important practical implication for the treatment of Covid-19 patients: our hypothesis is that Tocilizumab must be used exclusively in patients with an ongoing cytokine storm. Otherwise, an early use of Tocilizumab can be harmful, especially in patients affected by COPD or other conditions with mildly-elevated IL-6.","Bruzzese, Vincenzo; Lazzarino, Antonio Ivan",Med Hypotheses,,451

The aim of this study was to learn how COVID-19 influenced patients suffering from IBD during the quarantine period, focusing in particular on psychological distress through the Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10) and also the impact of the pandemic on therapeutic adherence using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective, single-centre and analytical observational study was carried out in the IBD unit in August 2020. Patients were contacted and interviewed by phone. A descriptive analysis was carried out and subsequently the factors associated with the loss of therapeutic adherence and higher-moderate levels of stress were analyzed through logistic regression multivariate analyses. RESULTS: A total of 426 patients were included with a median PSS-10 score of 12 (10-16). A higher level of stress was reported by those who were not married, women and those who experienced an increase in IBD-related symptoms. Adherence to treatment was not associated with stress based on the PSS-10 questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: Although the lockdown period due to the COVID-19 pandemic has probably had a significant emotional impact on Spaniards with IBD, IBD patients in general had lower PSS-10 scores.","Refaie, Engy; García Mateo, Sandra; Martínez Domínguez, Samuel Jesús; Gargallo-Puyuelo, Carla Jerusalén; Lario Quilez, Laura; Carrera-Lasfuentes, Patricia; Arroyo Villarino, María Teresa; Gomollón García, Fernando",Gastroenterol. hepatol.

The HRRs set out supplementary regulatory requirements for research. A legal analysis presented under the auspices of the Irish Academy of Medical Sciences (IAMS) on April 8 and November 25, 2019 at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland welcomed the introduction of GDPR and the HRRs. The analysis found the GDPR ""explicit consent"" introduced by the HRRs is problematic. A call was made to regulate informed consent in line with the common law as an achievable alternative safeguard, bringing Ireland in line with other EU Member States. AIMS: This article aims to review academic papers, legal opinion, EU opinion and advice and data protection law in relation to research and explicit consent, in order to examine the legal burden of GDPR and the HRRs on health research in Ireland and to determine whether the analysis presented at the IAMS meetings is reflected more widely in legal text. METHODS: Legal literature review of academic papers, legal opinion, EU opinion and advice and data protection legislation. RESULTS: The legal literature review overwhelmingly supports the concerns raised. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the GDPR explicit consent requirement of the HRRs is having had a significantly negative and far-reaching impact on the conduct of health research in Ireland. Urgent review of the HRRs and meaningful engagement between the health research community and legislators in healthcare is required.","Kirwan, Mary; Mee, Blanaid; Clarke, Niamh; Tanaka, Aoife; Manaloto, Lino; Halpin, Emma; Gibbons, Una; Cullen, Ann; McGarrigle, Sarah; Connolly, Elisabeth M; Bennett, Kathleen; Gaffney, Eoin; Flanagan, Ciaran; Tier, Laura; Flavin, Richard; McElvaney, Noel G",Ir. j. med. sci,,451

The model proposed is based on the available facts like the onset of lockdown (as announced by the Government on 25th day, {\tau}0 and the recovery pattern dictated by a mean life recovery time of {\tau}1 ( normally said to be around 14 days). The data of infected COVID-19 patients from March 2, to April 16, 2020 has been used to fit the evolution of infected, recovery and death counts. A slow rising exponential growth, with R0 close to 1/6, is found to represent the infected counts indicating almost a linear rise. The rest of growth, saturation and decay of data is comprehensibly modelled by incorporating lockdown time controlled R0, having a normal error function like behaviour decaying to zero in some time frame of {\tau}2 . The recovery mean life time {\tau}1 dictates the peak and decay. The results predicted for coming days are interesting and optimistic. The introduced time constants based on experimental data for both the recovery rate as well as for determining the time span of activity of R0 after the lockdown are subject of debate and provide possibility to introduce trigger factors to alter these to be more suited to the model. The model can be extended to other communities with their own R0 and recovery time parameters.","Jindal, V. K.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09912v1.pdf,451

This study's purpose is to establish paramedics’ knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. An online cross-sectional, descriptive study was conducted among paramedics in four hospitals via WhatsApp Messenger. The study population was composed of paramedics aged 18 years and above. A pre-validated questionnaire was used to evaluate KAP towards COVID-19. Bloom’s cut-off of 80% was used to assess sufficient knowledge (≥80%), positive attitude (≥4), and good practice (≥2.4). All analyses were performed using SPSS version 26 of the approaching 300 paramedics, 71 (24%) responded. The majority of participants were male (n=61, n=85.9%), with an average age of 33 (range: 18–57) years. Overall, 4.2% (n=3) had sufficient knowledge, 42% (n=30) had a positive attitude, and 4% (n=4) had good practice regarding to COVID-19. There was a statistically significant difference between paramedics’ KAP according to their socio-demographic characteristics. Younger paramedics (≥ 18) have sufficient knowledge and a good practice toward COVID-19 than older paramedics (≥37) (p=0.000, p=0.005), respectively. Older paramedics (≥37) have a positive attitude towards COVID-19 relative to younger paramedics (≥ 18) (p=0.000). A statistically significant difference between the total KAP and the level of education (p=0.000) at which the diploma (p=0.000) had sufficient knowledge of COVID-19 than the bachelors and the postgraduate level. Bachelor's and graduates have a positive attitude (p=0.000) towards COVID-19 than the diploma. Saudi paramedics have poor knowledge of COVID-19. In addition, the results of this study have shown that there are statistically significant differences in KAPs’ paramedics according to their demographic characteristics. The author suggests follow-up studies concerning emergency medical services (EMS) settings around the country.

489214,Antibody-mediated procoagulant platelets in SARS-CoV-2- vaccination associated immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia,2021,"Over the last two decades, there have been three deadly human outbreaks of coronaviruses (CoVs) caused by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, which has caused the current COVID-19 global pandemic. All three deadly CoVs originated from bats and transmitted to humans via various intermediate animal reservoirs. It remains highly possible that other global COVID pandemics will emerge in the coming years caused by yet another spillover of a bat-derived SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) into humans. Determining the Ag and the human B cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitope landscapes that are conserved among human and animal coronaviruses should inform in the development of future pan-coronavirus vaccines. In the current study, using several immunoinformatics and sequence alignment approaches, we identified several human B cell and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes that are highly conserved in 1) greater than 81,000 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences identified in 190 countries on six continents; 2) six circulating CoVs that caused previous human outbreaks of the common cold; 3) nine SL-CoVs isolated from bats; 4) nine SL-CoV isolated from pangolins; 5) three SL-CoVs isolated from civet cats; and 6) four MERS strains isolated from camels. Furthermore, the identified epitopes: 1) recalled B cells and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from both COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals who were never exposed to SARS-CoV-2, and 2) induced strong B cell and T cell responses in humanized HLA-DR1/HLA-A*02:01 double-transgenic mice.

RECENT FINDINGS: The current literature does not support the risk of intraoperative viral transmission nor does it suggest a harm of minimally invasive procedures in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, medical societies mostly adopted a precautionary approach with a focus on protective measures. Austrian surgeons considered MIS safe during the pandemic and Austria managed to keep the initial outbreak in control. Yet, MIS programs were still affected due to the postponements of elective procedures and switches to other methods by some surgeons. SUMMARY: The postponement and cancellation of MIS caused complexities in health-care delivery in Austria, whilst the evidence to substantiate this precautionary approach is missing. It must be noted, both the guidelines and our review are limited by the scarcity of evidence. In further consequence, regional factors should be considered while taking precautions. Specific studies on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 transmission risk during MIS are urgently needed.","Mun, Dong-Ho; Pradere, Benjamin; Shariat, Shahrokh F; Yurdakul, Ozan; Remzi, Mesut",Curr Opin Urol,,451

With the shift to online learning during the Covid-19 pandemic, new possibilities for teaching research methods have emerged. This case study compares two 5-week asynchronous online graduate level research methods courses in the field of Communication Sciences and Disorders. One online section of the course used traditional methods (TDL) common in face-to-face courses with recorded slide-based lectures, written discussion forums, and a final presentation. The other online section of the course used project-based learning (PBL), which consisted of weekly projects that forced students to engage with the literature and work both collaboratively and autonomously. We measured students’ research self-efficacy and course satisfaction before and after their courses. Overall, research self-efficacy was higher for the TDL class at both time points. However, the PBL class showed a higher percent increase in research self-efficacy, specifically for more difficult and unfamiliar tasks like statistical analysis. Students in both courses were equally satisfied with their course and instructor;however, students in the PBL class reported a greater workload and level of difficulty. We interpret the results as showing benefits of PBL in facilitating greater engagement with the research literature and course content;while TDL had advantages in students’ confidence with the course, likely due to familiarity with the instructional format. © Copyright © 2021 Randazzo, Priefer and Khamis-Dakwar.","Randazzo, M.; Priefer, R.; Khamis-Dakwar, R.",Frontiers in Education,,451

To adequately understand the emotional and social repercussions, a large-scale reconstruction of how people perceived these unexpected events is necessary but currently missing. We address this gap through social media by introducing MERCURIAL (Multi-layer Co-occurrence Networks for Emotional Profiling), a framework which exploits linguistic networks of words and hashtags to reconstruct social discourse describing real-world events. We use MERCURIAL to analyse 101,767 tweets from Italy, the first country to react to the COVID-19 threat with a nationwide lockdown. The data were collected between 11th and 17th March, immediately after the announcement of the Italian lockdown and the WHO declaring COVID-19 a pandemic. Our analysis provides unique insights into the psychological burden of this crisis, focussing on: (i) the Italian official campaign for self-quarantine (#iorestoacasa}), (ii) national lockdown (#italylockdown), and (iii) social denounce (#sciacalli). Our exploration unveils evidence for the emergence of complex emotional profiles, where anger and fear (towards political debates and socio-economic repercussions) coexisted with trust, solidarity, and hope (related to the institutions and local communities). We discuss our findings in relation to mental well-being issues and coping mechanisms, like instigation to violence, grieving, and solidarity. We argue that our framework represents an innovative thermometer of emotional status, a powerful tool for policy makers to quickly gauge feelings in massive audiences and devise appropriate responses based on cognitive data.","Stella, Massimo; Restocchi, Valerio; Deyne, Simon De",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.04404v1.pdf,451

While patents are a promising indicator of technological knowledge production widely used in innovation research, they are often an underused resource in biological sciences. In this study, we present a patent landscape for the seven coronaviruses known to infect humans. The information included in this paper provides a strong intellectual groundwork for the ongoing development of therapeutic agents and vaccines along with a deeper discussion of intellectual property rights under epidemic conditions. The results show that there has been a rapid increase in human coronavirus patents, especially COVID-19 patents. China and the United States play an outstanding role in global cooperation and patent application. The leading role of academic institutions and government is increasingly apparent. Notable technological issues related to human coronaviruses include pharmacochemical treatment, diagnosis of viral infection, viral-vector vaccines, and traditional Chinese medicine. Furthermore, a critical challenge lies in balancing commercial competition, enterprise profit, knowledge sharing, and public interest.","Liu, Kunmeng; Gu, Zixuan; Islam, Md Sahidul; Scherngell, Thomas; Kong, Xiangjun; Zhao, Jing; Chen, Xin; Hu, Yuanjia",Int J Biol Sci,,451

497649,"Management of birth, postpartum care and breastfeeding - Polish recommendations and guidelines during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic",2021,"In managing COVID-19 with non-pharmaceutical interventions, occupancy of intensive care units (ICU) is often used as an indicator to inform when to intensify mitigation and thus reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, strain on ICUs, and deaths. However, ICU occupancy thresholds at which action should be taken are often selected arbitrarily. We propose a quantitative approach using mathematical modeling to identify ICU occupancy thresholds at which mitigation should be triggered to avoid exceeding the ICU capacity available for COVID-19 patients. We used a stochastic compartmental model to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease progression, including critical cases that would require intensive care. We calibrated the model for the United States city of Chicago using daily COVID-19 ICU and hospital census data between March and August 2020. We projected ICU occupancies from September to May 2021 under two possible levels of transmission increase. The effect of combined mitigation measures was modeled as a decrease in the transmission rate that took effect when projected ICU occupancy reached a specified threshold. We found that mitigation did not immediately eliminate the risk of exceeding ICU capacity. Delaying action by 7 days increased the probability of exceeding ICU capacity by 10-60% and this increase could not be counteracted by stronger mitigation. Even under modest transmission increase, a threshold occupancy no higher than 60% was required when mitigation reduced the reproductive number Rt to just below 1. At higher transmission increase, a threshold of at most 40% was required with mitigation that reduced Rt below 0.75 within the first two weeks after mitigation. Our analysis demonstrates a quantitative approach for the selection of ICU occupancy thresholds that considers parameter uncertainty and compares relevant mitigation and transmission scenarios. An appropriate threshold will depend on the location, number of ICU beds available for COVID-19, available mitigation options, feasible mitigation strengths, and tolerated durations of intensified mitigation.","Runge, Manuela; Richardson, Reese A.K.; Clay, Patrick; Eagan, Arielle; Holden, Tobias M; Singam, Manisha; Tsuboyama, Natsumi; Arevalo, Philip; Fornoff, Jane; Patrick, Sarah; Ezike, Ngozi O.; Gerardin, Jaline",,,451

500743,A complementary critical appraisal on systematic reviews regarding the most efficient therapeutic strategies for the current COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic,2021,"The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in a variety of approaches for managing infection outbreaks in international populations. One example is mobile phone applications, which attempt to alert infected individuals and their contacts by automatically inferring two key components of infection risk: the proximity to an individual who may be infected, and the duration of proximity. The former component, proximity, relies on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Received Signal Strength Indicator(RSSI) as a distance sensor, and this has been shown to be problematic; not least because of unpredictable variations caused by different device types, device location on-body, device orientation, the local environment and the general noise associated with radio frequency propagation. In this paper, we present an approach that infers posterior probabilities over distance given sequences of RSSI values. Using a single-dimensional Unscented Kalman Smoother (UKS) for non-linear state space modelling, we outline several Gaussian process observation transforms, including: a generative model that directly captures sources of variation; and a discriminative model that learns a suitable observation function from training data using both distance and infection risk as optimisation objective functions. Our results show that good risk prediction can be achieved in $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time on real-world data sets, with the UKS outperforming more traditional classification methods learned from the same training data.","Lovett, Tom; Briers, Mark; Charalambides, Marcos; Jersakova, Radka; Lomax, James; Holmes, Chris",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.05057v1.pdf,451

By tracking the patients' symptoms, serum antibodies, and imaging manifestations after readmission, we found that they showed a trend of gradual improvement and recovery throughout treatment. They were cured without additional treatment, with the appearance of antibodies and the recovery of immune functions. CONCLUSIONS: It is deemed extremely necessary to improve the discharge standard of care. At the same time, nucleic acid detection is recommended to increase the dynamic monitoring of serum antibodies and imaging, strengthen the management of discharged patients, and appropriately extend the home or centralized isolation time.","Wu, Jian; Cheng, Juan; Shi, Xiaowei; Liu, Jun; Huang, Biao; Zhao, Xinguo; Qiu, Yuanwang; Yu, Jiong; Cao, Hongcui; Li, Lanjuan",BMC Pulm Med,,451

502005,Changes in digestive cancer diagnosis during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Italy: A nationwide survey,2021,"Large scale disease screening is a complicated process in which high costs must be balanced against pressing public health needs. When the goal is screening for infectious disease, one approach is group testing in which samples are initially tested in pools and individual samples are retested only if the initial pooled test was positive. Intuitively, if the prevalence of infection is small, this could result in a large reduction of the total number of tests required. Despite this, the use of group testing in medical studies has been limited, largely due to skepticism about the impact of pooling on the accuracy of a given assay. While there is a large body of research addressing the issue of testing errors in group testing studies, it is customary to assume that the misclassification parameters are known from an external population and/or that the values do not change with the group size. Both of these assumptions are highly questionable for many medical practitioners considering group testing in their study design. In this article, we explore how the failure of these assumptions might impact the efficacy of a group testing design and, consequently, whether group testing is currently feasible for medical screening. Specifically, we look at how incorrect assumptions about the sensitivity function at the design stage can lead to poor estimation of a procedure's overall sensitivity and expected number of tests. Furthermore, if a validation study is used to estimate the pooled misclassification parameters of a given assay, we show that the sample sizes required are so large as to be prohibitive in all but the largest screening programs","Haber, Gregory; Malinovsky, Yaakov; Albert, Paul S.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04837v1.pdf,451

This study examines how news of presence of COVID-19 in Thailand, as well as varying levels of government restriction on movement, affected human mobility in a rural Thai population along the border with Myanmar. METHODS: This study makes use of mobility data collected using a smartphone app. Between November 2019 and June 2020, four major events concerning information dissemination or government intervention give rise to five time intervals of analysis. Radius of gyration is used to analyze movement in each interval, and movement during government-imposed curfew. Human mobility network visualization is used to identify changes in travel patterns between main geographic locations of activity. Cross-border mobility analysis highlights potential for intervillage and intercountry disease transmission. RESULTS: Inter-village and cross-border movement was common in the pre-COVID-19 period. Radius of gyration and cross-border trips decreased following news of the first imported cases. During the government lockdown period, radius of gyration was reduced by more than 90% and cross-border movement was mostly limited to short-distance trips. Human mobility was nearly back to normal after relaxation of the lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insight into the impact of the government lockdown policy on an area with extremely low socio-economic status, poor healthcare resources, and highly active cross-border movement. The lockdown had a great impact on reducing individual mobility, including cross-border movement. The quick return to normal mobility after relaxation of the lockdown implies that close monitoring of disease should be continued to prevent a second wave.","Haddawy, Peter; Lawpoolsri, Saranath; Sa-Ngamuang, Chaitawat; Su Yin, Myat; Barkowsky, Thomas; Wiratsudakul, Anuwat; Kaewkungwal, Jaranit; Khamsiriwatchara, Amnat; Sa-Angchai, Patiwat; Sattabongkot, Jetsumon; Cui, Liwang",PLoS One,,451

This long history has manifested many paradigm-like shifts. Researchers have fluctuated between treating animals as models of human learning to emphasizing stark differences between animal and human behavior to stressing psychological continuity across species. At this time, there appears little consensus regarding questions of psychological continuity. I argue that this is a futile debate. Rather than focusing on behavior in nonhuman animals that represent potential parallels to human psychology (or behavior), comparative psychologists should focus on questions of development, function, and mechanism of behavior to better understand the behavior of all species in biological context. A focus on understanding underlying mechanisms for behavior rather than settling on behavioral outcomes alone as diagnostic of a species' status on some imaginary scale of progress will help address anthropocentric biases in current approaches. A focus on the ""why"" and ""how"" questions espoused by Tinbergen over half a century ago will move the field in better alignment with related fields, such as ethology, and provide greater insights into both animal and human minds.

Clinicians need evidence based on randomized trials regarding effective medical treatments for this infection. Currently no effective therapies exist for the progression of the mild forms to severe disease. Knowledge however is rapidly expanding. Remdesivir, an anti- retroviral agent has in vitro activity against this virus and has shown to decrease the duration of ICU care in patients with severe disease, while low dose dexamethasone also showed a decrease in the duration of stay in cases of severe disease requiring assisted ventilation. At the time of writing this article, two mRNA-based vaccines have shown an approximate 95 % efficacy in preventing infection in large clinical trials. At least one of these drugs has regulatory permission for vaccination in high-income countries. Low and middle-income countries may have difficulties in initiating vaccine programs on large scales because of availability, costs, refrigeration and dissemination. Adequately powered randomized trials are required for drugs with in vitro activity against the virus. Supportive care should be provided for stable, hypoxia and pneumonia free patients on imaging. Vaccines are of obvious benefit and given the preliminary evidence of the efficacy of over 95 %, Low and middle-income countries must develop links with the WHO COVAX program to ensure global distribution of vaccines.","Gathiram, Premjith; Moodley, Jagidesa; Khaliq, Olive P",J Reprod Immunol,,451

The generation time, also known as the generation interval, is the time between infection events in an infector-infectee pair. The serial interval and the generation time are key parameters for assessing the dynamics of a disease. A number of scientific papers reported information pertaining to the serial interval and/or generation time for COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: Conduct a review of available evidence to advise on appropriate parameter values for serial interval and generation time in national COVID-19 transmission models for Ireland and on methodological issues relating to those parameters. METHODS: We conducted a rapid review of the literature covering the period 1 January 2020 and 21 August 2020, following predefined eligibility criteria. Forty scientific papers met our inclusion criteria and were included in the review. RESULTS: The mean of the serial interval ranged from 3.03 to 7.6 days, based on 38 estimates, and the median from 1.0 to 6.0 days (based on 15 estimates). Only three estimates were provided for the mean of the generation time. These ranged from 3.95 to 5.20 days. One estimate of 5.0 days was provided for the median of the generation time. DISCUSSION: Estimates of the serial interval and the generation time are very dependent on the specific factors that apply at the time that the data are collected, including the level of social contact. Consequently, the estimates may not be entirely relevant to other environments. Therefore, local estimates should be obtained as soon as possible. Careful consideration should be given to the methodology that is used. Real-time estimations of the serial interval/generation time, allowing for variations over time, may provide more accurate estimates of reproduction numbers than using conventionally fixed serial interval/generation time distributions.","Griffin, John; Casey, Miriam; Collins, Áine; Hunt, Kevin; McEvoy, David; Byrne, Andrew; McAloon, Conor; Barber, Ann; Lane, Elizabeth Ann; More, SImon",BMJ Open,,451

Objectives: Evaluation of cytological physiognomies in relation to possible age influence and the genotype distribution of human papillomaviruses among HPV/HIV co-infected and HPV monoinfected women in Kisii, Kenya. Methods: The case-control study enrolled 42 HPV/HIV co-infected and 42 HPV monoinfected women. Cervical swabs were collected in ThinPrep vials for HPV tying and cytological analysis. HPV subtypes were assayed by Xpert® HPV system (GXHPV-CE-10). Results: Mono-infected women aged 30-39 years had the highest proportion of low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) at 14 (16.67%) while the co-infected aged 50-59 years had the highest proportion of high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) at 9 (10.71%). HPV-16 genotype was the most predominant and it increased with age rise. Older coinfected and mono-infected women (>40 years) had HSIL and LSIL as the most predominant cytological grade respectively.

Material y Métodos: Se realizó una revisión de la literatura existente hasta la fecha en publicaciones de revistas indexadas en MEDLINE, LILACS, SciELO, LATINDEX, MEDIGRAPHY, MEDSCAPE, Science Direct Elsevier y PubMed y noticias divulgadas en boletines de la OMS/OPS, el Portal de INFOMED y otras agencias de noticias con buenas evidencias científicas. Desarrollo: Se realiza el análisis de los conocimientos actuales en la patogenia y el proceso inflamatorio pulmonar de no ser una simple neumonía viral sino un proceso inflamatorio local y sistémico que involucra diferentes órganos, trastornos de la coagulación y alteraciones en la inmunidad y hace más vulnerables sobre todo al adulto mayor con comorbilidades, al ocasionar gravedad y elevar la mortalidad. Conclusiones: La patogenia de esta enfermedad, mejor conocida en la actualidad, explica las implicaciones en los casos críticos y graves con elevada mortalidad, sobre todo en los más vulnerables. El SARS y sus complicaciones evolutivas no son explicables solo por la inflamación pulmonar. Intervienen otros factores involucrados en la conocida patogenia de mucha mayor gravedad que conducen a un desenlace fatal.","Serra Valdes, Miguel Ángel",Rev. habanera cienc. méd,,451
514891,Procoagulant activity of extracellular vesicles in plasma of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection,2021,"Virus evolution and mutation analyses are crucial for tracing virus transmission, the potential variants, and other pathogenic determinants. Despite continuing circulation of the SARS-CoV-2, very limited studies have been conducted on genetic evolutionary analysis of the virus in Bangladesh. In this study, a total of 791 complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from Bangladesh deposited in the GISAID database during March 2020 to January 2021 were analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed circulation of seven GISAID clades G, GH, GR, GRY, L, O, and S or five Nextstrain clades 20A, 20B, 20C, 19A, and 19B in the country during the study period. The GISAID clade GR or the Nextstrain clade 20B or lineage B.1.1.25 is predominant in Bangladesh and closely related to the sequences from India, USA, Canada, UK, and Italy. The GR clade or B.1.1.25 lineage is likely to be responsible for the widespread community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the country during the first wave of infection. Significant amino acid diversity was observed among Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 isolates, where a total of 1023 mutations were detected. In particular, the D614G mutation in the spike protein (S_D614G) was found in 97% of the sequences. However, the introduction of lineage B.1.1.7 (UK variant/S_N501Y) and S_E484K mutation in lineage B.1.1.25 in a few sequences reported in late December 2020 is of particular concern. The wide genomic diversity indicated multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Bangladesh through various routes. Therefore, a continuous and extensive genome sequence analysis would be necessary to understand the genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Bangladesh.","Parvin, Rokshana Afrin Sultana Zahura Begum Jahan Ara Ahmed Salma Nooruzzaman Mohammed Chowdhury Emdadul Haque Pohlmann Anne Paul Shyamal Kumar",Microorganisms,,451
515177,"Presence and strength of binding of IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 during CoViD-19 infection",2021,"BACKGROUND: The demand for bariatric surgery is high and so is the need for training future bariatric surgeons. Bariatric surgery, as a technically demanding surgery, imposes a learning curve that may initially induce higher morbidity. In order to limit the clinical impact of this learning curve, a simulation preclinical training can be offered. The aim of the work was to assess the realism of a new cadaveric model for simulated bariatric surgery (sleeve and Roux in Y gastric bypass). AIM: A face validation study of SimLife, a new dynamic cadaveric model of simulated body for acquiring operative skills by simulation. The objectives of this study are first of all to measure the realism of this model, the satisfaction of learners, and finally the ability of this model to facilitate a learning process. METHODS: SimLife technology is based on a fresh body (frozen/thawed) given to science associated to a patented technical module, which can provide pulsatile vascularization with simulated blood heated to 37 °C and ventilation. RESULTS: Twenty-four residents and chief residents from 3 French University Digestive Surgery Departments were enrolled in this study. Based on their evaluation, the overall satisfaction of the cadaveric model was rated as 8.52, realism as 8.91, anatomic correspondence as 8.64, and the model's ability to be learning tool as 8.78. CONCLUSION: The use of the SimLife model allows proposing a very realistic surgical simulation model to realistically train and objectively evaluate the performance of young surgeons.","Danion, J; Donatini, G; Breque, C; Oriot, D; Richer, J P; Faure, J P",Obes. surg,,451
515381,The Effects of Lockdown During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic on Neuro-Trauma Related Hospital Admissions,2020,"INTRODUCTION: As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, outpatient diagnostic imaging (DI) facilities experienced decreased operations and even unprecedented closures. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of COVID-19 on the practices of DI clinics, and investigate the reasons for the change in their operations during the initial period of the pandemic starting in mid-March 2020. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire was created and distributed to the managers of eighteen outpatient DI clinics in London, Hamilton, and Halton, Ontario, Canada. The managers indicated whether their clinics had closed or decreased operations, the reasons for closure, and the types of imaging examinations conducted in the initial period of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Fifty percent of the DI clinics surveyed (9/18) closed as a result of COVID-19, and those that remained open had decreased hours of operation. The clinics that closed indicated decreased referrals as the primary reason for closure, followed by staff shortage, concerns for safety, and suspension of elective imaging. Chest radiography and obstetric ultrasound were the most commonly conducted examinations. Clinics that were in close geographical proximity were able to redistribute imaging examinations amongst themselves. All DI clinics had suspended BMD examinations and elective breast screening, and some transitioned to booked appointments only. CONCLUSION: Many DI clinics needed to close or decrease operations as a result of COVID-19, a phenomenon that is unprecedented in radiological practice. The results of this study can assist outpatient DI clinics in preparing for subsequent waves of COVID-19, future pandemics, and other periods of crisis.","Maizlin, Nick N; Ohorodnyk, Pavlo",Journal of medical imaging and radiation sciences (Online),,451
515683,Author Correction: Phase 1/2 trial of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 with a booster dose induces multifunctional antibody responses,2021,"AIM: We aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the efficacy and safety of mirogabalin in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP). METHODS: We searched four databases from inception to July 1st, 2020. We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which assessed the effectiveness and safety of mirogabalin in patients with DPNP. We evaluated the quality of the included RCTs using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. We pooled dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios and continuous outcomes as mean differences with 95% confidence intervals, both under the random- or fixed-effects model. RESULTS: Three RCTs matched our inclusion criteria with a total of 1732 patients with DPNP: 1057, 534, and 141 patients received mirogabalin, placebo, and pregabalin, respectively. The quality of included RCTs was marked as moderate-to-high. Mirogabalin treatment was significantly associated with a significant reduction in the average daily pain score (ADPS) compared to placebo over seven weeks. Compared to pregabalin, mirogabalin was significantly associated with more decrease in ADPS only after three, four, and five weeks. The proportion of patients with &#8805;30% and &#8805;50% reduction in the ADPS was significantly higher in the mirogabalin versus placebo and pregabalin groups. Compared to placebo, mirogabalin was significantly associated with more adverse events of dizziness, increased weight, peripheral edema, and somnolence. The safety profile was comparable between mirogabalin and pregabalin. CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that in patients with DPNP, mirogabalin treatment was superior to placebo and pregabalin in decreasing the ADPS over time. Besides, mirogabalin was largely safe and associated with some adverse events that could be managed conservatively.","Alyoubi, Reem Abdullah; Alshareef, Aysha Abdulmalek; Aldughaither, Saud Musaab; Aljaroudi, Abeer Mahdi; Alabdulwahed, Alwaleed; Alduraibi, Faisal Muhammed; Taher Masoud, Ahmed; Abu-Zaid, Ahmed",Int J Clin Pract,,451

517817,Notes from the Field: Teaching the History of Epidemics in the Midst of the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: A 2-level factorial pilot study was conducted in 2007 just before starting a randomized clinical trial comparing tomotherapy and conventional radiotherapy (CR) to reduce cardiac and pulmonary adverse effects in breast cancer, considering tumor laterality (left/right), target volume (with/without nodal irradiation), surgery (tumorectomy/mastectomy), and patient position (prone/supine). The study was revisited using a penalty score based on the recently developed mean absolute dose deviation (MADD). METHODS: Eight patients with a unique combination of laterality, nodal coverage, and surgery underwent dual tomotherapy and CR treatment planning in both prone and supine positions, providing 32 distinct combinations. The penalty score was applied using the weighted sum of the MADDs. The Lenth method for unreplicated 2-level factorial design was used in the analysis. RESULTS: The Lenth analysis identified nodal irradiation as the active main effect penalizing the dosimetry by 1.14 Gy (P = 0.001). Other significant effects were left laterality (0.94 Gy), mastectomy (0.61 Gy), and interactions between left mastectomy (0.89 Gy) and prone mastectomy (0.71 Gy), with P-values between 0.005 and 0.05. Tomotherapy provided a small reduction in penalty (reduction of 0.54 Gy) through interaction with nodal irradiation (P = 0.080). Some effects approached significance with P-values > 0.05 and &#8804; 0.10 for interactions of prone × mastectomy × left (0.60 Gy), nodal irradiation × mastectomy (0.59 Gy), and prone × left (0.55 Gy) and the main effect prone (0.52 Gy). CONCLUSIONS: The historical dosimetric analysis previously revealed the feasibility of tomotherapy, but a conclusion could not be made. The MADD-based score is promising, and a new analysis highlights the impact of factors and hierarchy of priorities that need to be addressed if major gains are to be attained.","Heymann, Steve; Dipasquale, Giovanna; Nguyen, Nam P; San, Meymey; Gorobets, Olena; Leduc, Nicolas; Verellen, Dirk; Storme, Guy; Van Parijs, Hilde; De Ridder, Mark; Vinh-Hung, Vincent",Technol Cancer Res Treat,,451

590493,Co‐infection of influenza A virus and SARS‐CoV‐2: A retrospective cohort study,2021-01-27,"COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has resulted in over 800,000 deaths. Robust humoral anti-viral immune responses have the potential to generate a diverse set of neutralizing antibodies to eliminate viruses and protect against re-infection, transmission, and the evolution of mutations that escape targeted therapeutics. CD73 is present on the majority of human B cells and a subset of T cells where it plays a role in lymphocyte activation and migration. CD73 also functions as an ectoenzyme that converts AMP into adenosine, which can be immunosuppressive. Here we report on CPI-006, a humanized Fc{gamma}R binding-deficient IgG1 anti-CD73 antibody that blocks CD73 enzymatic activity and directly activates CD73+ B cells, inducing differentiation into plasmablasts, immunoglobulin class switching, and antibody secretion independent of adenosine. Immunophenotypic analysis of peripheral blood from advanced cancer patients receiving CPI-006 revealed evidence of B cell activation, clonal expansion, and development of memory B cells. These immune effects suggested that CPI-006 may be effective at enhancing the magnitude, diversity, and duration of humoral and cellular responses to viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. We have therefore initiated a Phase 1, single-dose, dose-escalation trial in hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. The objectives of this trial are to evaluate the safety of CPI-006 in COVID-19 patients and to determine effects of CPI-006 on anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses and the development of memory B cell and T cells. Ten patients have been enrolled in the trial receiving doses of 0.3 mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg. All evaluable patients had low pre-treatment serum levels of anti-viral antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein and its receptor binding domain, independent of the duration of their COVID-19 related symptoms prior to enrollment. Anti-viral antibody responses were induced 7 days after CPI-006 treatment and titers continued to rise past Day 56. Increases in the frequency of memory B cells and effector/memory T cells were observed 28 days after treatment. These preliminary results suggest that CPI-006 activates B cells and may enhance and prolong anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in patients with COVID-19. This approach may be useful for treating COVID-19 or as an adjuvant to enhance the efficacy of vaccines.","Willingham, S. B.; Criner, G.; Hill, C.; Hu, S.; Rudnick, J.

Originally these proteases have been assigned to cooperate solely in executing the unselective ‘bulk proteolysis’ within the acidic milieu of the lysosome. Although to some degree this notion still holds true, evidence is accumulating for specific and regulatory functions of individual ‘acidic’ proteases in many cellular processes linked to the endosomal/lysosomal compartment. Here we summarize and discuss the functions of individual endolysosomal proteases in such diverse processes as the termination of growth factor signaling, lipoprotein particle degradation, infection, antigen presentation, and autophagy.

591262,Approach to SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis,2021-06-21,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: While a great deal of literature has been published recently on the viral kinetics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and diagnostic testing performance for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the general population, a relative paucity of information has come to light regarding implications of COVID-19 diagnostics for solid organ transplantation. This review examines the current state of knowledge regarding the two principal diagnostic testing strategies for SARS-CoV-2 infection, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–based testing and serology, and discusses COVID-19 diagnostic implications for solid organ transplantation. RECENT FINDINGS: The interpretation of diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 infection can present several challenges and raises questions regarding optimal donor and candidate screening as well as infection prevention practices in solid organ transplant recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Guidance from several societies regarding donor and recipient suitability for transplantation during the COVID-19 pandemic is reviewed. Prolonged positive testing by polymerase chain reaction has been described in transplant recipients which may impact infection prevention practices. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has put multiple aspects of solid organ transplantation at risk, with impacts on donor and recipient suitability, and mitigation of infection and transmission after transplantation. Accumulating evidence regarding diagnostic fidelity and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in immunocompromised patients will continue to inform optimal practices surrounding solid organ transplantation during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Trubin, Paul A.; Azar, Marwan M.; Malinis, Maricar",Curr Transplant Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33134033/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40472-020-00307-w,451
591471,Home Medical Nutrition during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic – a position paper,2020-05-11,"BACKGROUND: So far, only a few studies evaluated the correlation between CT features and clinical outcome in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. PURPOSE: To evaluate CT ability in differentiating critically ill patients requiring invasive ventilation from patients with less severe disease. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from patients admitted to our institution for COVID-19 pneumonia between March 5th-24th. Patients were considered critically ill or non-critically ill, depending on the need for mechanical ventilation. CT images from both groups were analyzed for the assessment of qualitative features and disease extension, using a quantitative semiautomatic method. We evaluated the differences between the two groups for clinical, laboratory and CT data. Analyses were conducted on a per-protocol basis. RESULTS: 189 patients were analyzed. PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio and oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) were decreased in critically ill patients. At CT, mixed pattern (ground glass opacities (GGO) and consolidation) and GGO alone were more frequent respectively in critically ill and in non-critically ill patients (p < 0.05). Lung volume involvement was significantly higher in critically ill patients (38.5 % vs. 5.8 %, p < 0.05). A cut-off of 23.0 % of lung involvement showed 96 % sensitivity and 96 % specificity in distinguishing critically ill patients from patients with less severe disease. The fraction of involved lung was related to lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio and SaO(2) (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Lung disease extension, assessed using quantitative CT, has a significant relationship with clinical severity and may predict the need for invasive ventilation in patients with COVID-19.","Leonardi, Andrea; Scipione, Roberto; Alfieri, Giulia; Petrillo, Roberta; Dolciami, Miriam; Ciccarelli, Fabio; Perotti, Stefano; Cartocci, Gaia; Scala, Annarita; Imperiale, Carmela; Iafrate, Franco; Francone, Marco; Catalano, Carlo; Ricci, Paolo",Eur J Radiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.109202; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32745895/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0720048X20303910; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0720048X20303910?v=s5,451

In some pathogenic bacteria, an operon‐encoded mono‐ADP‐ribosylation cycle mediates response to host‐induced oxidative stress. In this system, reversible mono ADP‐ribosylation of a lipoylated target protein represses oxidative stress response. An NAD(+)‐dependent sirtuin catalyzes the single ADP‐ribose (ADPr) addition, while a linked macrodomain‐containing protein removes the ADPr. Here we report the crystal structure of the sitruin‐linked macrodomain protein from Staphylococcus aureus, SauMacro (also known as SAV0325) to 1.75‐Å resolution. The monomeric SauMacro bears a previously unidentified Zn(2+)‐binding site that putatively aids in substrate recognition and catalysis. An amino‐terminal three‐helix bundle motif unique to this class of macrodomain proteins provides a structural scaffold for the Zn(2+) site. Structural features of the enzyme further indicate a cleft proximal to the Zn(2+) binding site appears well suited for ADPr binding, while a deep hydrophobic channel in the protein core is suitable for binding the lipoate of the lipoylated protein target.","Appel, C.

593081,SARS-CoV-2-Induced Severe Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura,2020-05-28,"BACKGROUND: Recruitment processes for clinical trials of digital interventions for psychosis are seldom described in detail in the literature. Although trial staff have expertise in describing barriers to and facilitators of recruitment, a specific focus on understanding recruitment from the point of view of trial staff is rare, and because trial staff are responsible for meeting recruitment targets, a lack of research on their point of view is a key limitation. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to understand recruitment from the point of view of trial staff and discover what they consider important. METHODS: We applied pluralistic ethnographic methods, including analysis of trial documents, observation, and focus groups, and explored the recruitment processes of the EMPOWER (Early Signs Monitoring to Prevent Relapse in Psychosis and Promote Well-being, Engagement, and Recovery) feasibility trial, which is a digital app–based intervention for people diagnosed with schizophrenia. RESULTS: Recruitment barriers were categorized into 2 main themes: service characteristics (lack of time available for mental health staff to support recruitment, staff turnover, patient turnover [within Australia only], management styles of community mental health teams, and physical environment) and clinician expectations (filtering effects and resistance to research participation). Trial staff negotiated these barriers through strategies such as emotional labor (trial staff managing feelings and expressions to successfully recruit participants) and trying to build relationships with clinical staff working within community mental health teams. CONCLUSIONS: Researchers in clinical trials for digital psychosis interventions face numerous recruitment barriers and do their best to work flexibly and to negotiate these barriers and meet recruitment targets. The recruitment process appeared to be enhanced by trial staff supporting each other throughout the recruitment stage of the trial.","Allan, Stephanie; Mcleod, Hamish; Bradstreet, Simon; Bell, Imogen; Whitehill, Helen; Wilson-Kay, Alison; Clark, Andrea; Matrunola, Claire; Morton, Emma; Farhall, John; Gleeson, John; Gumley, Andrew",JMIR Hum Factors,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33666555/; https://doi.org/10.2196/24055,451

This requires detailed understanding of underlying metabolic pathways involved in the production of the targeted substances, and how the cellular processes or growth conditions are regulated by the engineering. To achieve this goal, a large system of experimental techniques, compound libraries, computational methods and data resources, including the multi-omics data, are used. The recent advent of multi-omics systems biology approaches significantly impacted the field by opening new avenues to perform dynamic and large-scale analyses that deepen our knowledge on the manipulations. However, with the enormous transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics available, it is a daunting task to integrate the data for a more holistic understanding. Novel data mining and analytics approaches, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), can provide breakthroughs where traditional low-throughput experiment-alone methods cannot easily achieve. Here, we review the latest attempts of combining systems biology and AI in metabolic engineering research, and highlight how this alliance can help overcome the current challenges facing industrial biotechnology, especially for food-related substances and compounds using microorganisms.","Helmy, Mohamed; Smith, Derek; Selvarajoo, Kumar",Metab Eng Commun,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214030120300493; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214030120300493?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mec.2020.e00149; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33072513/,451

Community Health Workers (CHWs) in Mozambique are known locally as agentes polivalentes elementares (APEs). While technical guidance surrounding COVID-19 is available to support APEs, communicating this information has been challenging due to restrictions on travel, face-to-face group meetings and training, imposed from May to August 2020. A digital health platform, upSCALE, that already supports 1,213 APEs and 299 supervisors across three provinces, is being used to support APEs on effective COVID-19 management by delivering COVID-19 sensitive SMS messages, training modules and a COVID-19 KAP survey. The KAP survey, conducted from June 2020 to August 2020, consisted of 10 questions. Of 1,065 active upSCALE APEs, 28 percent completed the survey. Results indicate that only a small proportion of APEs listed the correct COVID-19 symptoms, transmission routes and appropriate prevention measures (25 percent, 16 percent and 39 percent, respectively) specifically included in national health education materials. Misconceptions were mainly related to transmission routes, high risk individuals and asymptomatic patients. 84 percent said they followed all government prevention guidelines. The results from the KAP survey were used to support the rapid development and deployment of targeted COVID-19 awareness and education materials for the APEs. SMS messages were continually adjusted based on the KAP survey results and a series of seven COVID-19 training modules were developed and disseminated. A follow-up KAP survey is planned for November 2020. Adapting the existing upSCALE platform enabled a better understanding, in real time, of the KAP of APEs around COVID-19 management. Subsequently, supported improved delivery of tailored messages and education, vital for ensuring a successful COVID-19 response.","Feldman, Mitra; Krylova, Vera Lacey; Farrow, Poppy; Donovan, Laura; Zandamela, Edson; Rebelo, Joaquim; Rodrigues, Maria; Bulo, Antonio; Ferraz, Carlos; Gonzalez, Juan Romero; Rodrigues, Humberto; Roca-Feltrer, Arantxa; Baker, Kevin",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.05.20216606; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.05.20216606v1?rss=1,451

Rapid and accurate detection of respiratory viruses is crucial for appropriate patient treatment and prevention of endemic spread. OBJECTIVES: We compared two multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for the detection of respiratory viral pathogens. METHODS: A total of 245 respiratory specimens (229 sputum samples, 14 bronchoalveolar lavage samples, 6 nasal swabs, 3 throat swabs, 7 unknown) were analyzed using two multiplex assays: One‐step RV real‐time PCR (BioSewoom, Seoul, Korea) and Seeplex RV 12 Detection kit (Seegene, Seoul, Korea). The results were further confirmed using sequencing as a reference. RESULTS: Among 245 samples (265 identifications including co‐infections), the identification of respiratory viruses was 44.9% (119/265), 44.2% (117/265) and 45.3% (120/265) by One‐step RV assay, Seeplex RV assay and sequencing, respectively. The concordance rate between One‐step RV assay and sequencing was 95.5% (253/265), and that between Seeplex RV assay and sequencing was 89.8% (238/265) (P = 0.0189). The sensitivities of One‐step RV and Seeplex RV assays were 94.1% [95% confidential interval (CI), 88.3%–97.6%] and 83.3% (95% CI, 75.4%–89.5%), respectively (P = 0.0002).

However, optimal viruses are highly diluted in wastewater, and a validated method to be concentrated for further processing and suitable reference viruses are the main needs to be established for reliable SARS-CoV-2 municipal wastewater detection. For this purpose, we collected wastewater from two European cities during the Covid-19 pandemic and evaluated the sensitivity of RT-qPCR detection of viral RNA after four concentration methods (two variants of ultrafiltration-based method and two adsorption and extraction-based methods). Further, we evaluated one external (Bovine corona virus) and one internal (pepper mild mottle virus) reference virus. We found a consistently higher recovery of spiked virus using the modified ultrafiltration-based method. This method also had a significantly higher efficiency (p-value <0.01) for wastewater SARS-CoV-2 detection. The ultracentrifugation method was the only method that detected SARS-CoV-2 in the wastewater of both cities.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has set global targets for the elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030. However, current levels of global investment in viral hepatitis elimination programmes are insufficient to achieve these goals. METHODS: To catalyse political commitment and to encourage domestic- and international-financing, we used published modelling data and key stakeholder interviews to develop an investment framework to demonstrate the return on investment for viral hepatitis elimination. RESULTS: The framework utilizes a public health approach to identify evidence-based national activities that reduce viral hepatitis-related morbidity and mortality, as well as international activities and critical enablers that allow countries to achieve maximum impact on health outcomes from investment to achieve WHO 2030 elimination targets.

On the other hand, COVID‐19 resulted in several hundred thousand deaths since December 2019 and remains without an efficient and safe treatment. The antimalarials chloroquine (CQ) and its analogue, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), have been tested for COVID‐19 treatment, and several conflicting evidence has been obtained. Therefore, the aim of this review was to summarize the evidence regarding action mechanisms of these compounds against Plasmodium and SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, together with cytometry applications. CQ and HCQ act on the renin angiotensin system, with possible implications on the cardiorespiratory system. In this context, flow and image cytometry emerge as powerful technologies to investigate the mechanism of therapeutic candidates, as well as for the identification of the immune response and prognostics of disease severity. Data from the large randomized trials support the conclusion that CQ and HCQ do not provide any clinical beneficial in disease severity and progression in SARS‐CoV‐2 patients, as well as, do not present any solid evidence of increased serious side effects.

In most patients, the course of COVID-19 was mild, with hospital treatment being necessary in five (9%). At presentation, patients most often reported persistent fatigue (75%), chest pain (71%), and shortness of breath (66%). Acute myocarditis was confirmed by T1/T2-weighed CMR and elevated NTpro-BNP levels in a single patient (2%). Left ventricular ejection fraction was 56% in this patient. Additional eight patients (14%) showed suspicious CMR findings, including myocardial edema without fibrosis (n = 3), or non-ischemic myocardial injury suggesting previous inflammation (n = 5). However, myocarditis could ultimately not be confirmed according to 2018 Lake Louise criteria; ECG, echo and lab findings were inconspicuous in all eight patients. CONCLUSIONS: Among 56 post-COVID patients with persistent thoracic complaints final diagnosis of myocarditis could be confirmed in a single patient using CMR.

The payment system has long rewarded hospitals for providing elective surgical procedures to well-insured patients while penalizing those providing the most essential and urgent services, causing hospital revenues to plummet as elective procedures were cancelled during the pandemic. Before the recession caused by the pandemic, tens of millions of Americans were unable to afford care, compromising their physical and financial health; deep-pocketed corporate interests were increasingly dominating the hospital industry and taking over physicians’ practices; and insurers’ profits hit record levels. Meanwhile, yawning class-based and racial inequities in care and health outcomes remain and have even widened. Recent data highlight the failure of policy strategies based on market models and the need to shift to a nonprofit social insurance model.","Himmelstein, David U.; Woolhandler, Steffie",Int J Health Serv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32605414/; https://doi.org/10.1177/0020731420937631,451

Simultaneously, required strengths of intervention measures are strongly debated because containing COVID-19 in favor of the weak health care system largely conflicts with socio-economic hardships. Here we analyze the impact of interventions on outbreak dynamics for South Africa, exhibiting the largest case numbers across sub-saharan Africa, before and after their national lockdown. Past data indicate strongly reduced but still supracritical growth after lockdown. Moreover, large-scale agent-based simulations given different future scenarios for the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality with 1.14 million inhabitants, based on detailed activity and mobility survey data of about 10% of the population, similarly suggest that current containment may be insufficient to not overload local intensive care capacity. Yet, enduring, slightly stronger or more specific interventions, combined with sufficient compliance, may constitute a viable option for interventions for South Africa.","Schröder, Malte; Bossert, Andreas; Kersting, Moritz; Aeffner, Sebastian; Coetzee, Justin; Timme, Marc; Schlüter, Jan",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33654164/; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12319v1.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-84487-0,451

Clinical testing alone provides a snapshot of infected individuals but is costly and difficult to perform logistically across whole populations. The virus which causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, is shed in human feces and urine and can be detected in human waste. SARS-CoV-2 can be shed in high concentrations (>10(7) genomic copies/mL) due to its ability to replicate in the gastrointestinal tract of humans through attachment to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors there. Monitoring wastewater for SARS-CoV-2, alongside clinical testing, can more accurately represent the spread of disease within a community. This protocol describes a reliable and efficacious method to recover SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, quantify genomic RNA levels, and evaluate concentration fluctuations over time. Using this protocol, viral levels as low as 10 genomic copies/mL were successfully detected from 30 mL of wastewater in more than seven-hundred samples collected between August 2020 and March 2021. Through the adaptation of traditional enteric virus methods used in food safety research, targets have been reliably detected with no inhibition of detection (RT-qPCR) observed in any sample processed. This protocol is currently used for surveillance of wastewater systems across New Castle County, Delaware.","Anderson-Coughlin, Brienna L.; Shearer, Adrienne E. H.; Omar, Alexis N.; Wommack, K.

The actual risk to medical crew members is not known. METHODS: We conducted an institutional review board‐exempt, retrospective study of air medical transport of patients with known or suspected COVID‐19 by 8 programs in the Four Corners Region to determine the number of symptomatic COVID‐19 among air medical crew members compared to total exposure time. All programs used similar routine personal protective equipment (PPE), including N‐95 masks and eye protection. Total exposure time was considered from time of first patient contact until handoff at a receiving hospital. RESULTS: There were 616 air transports: 62% by fixed‐wing and 38% by rotor‐wing aircraft between March 15 and September 6, 2020. Among transported patients, 407 (66%) were confirmed COVID+ and 209 (34%) were under investigation. Patient contact time ranged from 38 to 432 minutes with an average of 140 minutes. The total exposure time for medical crew was 2924 hours; exposure time to confirmed COVID+ patients was 2008 hours. Only 30% of patients were intubated, and the remainder had no oxygen (8%), low‐flow nasal cannula (42%), mask (11%), high‐flow nasal cannula (4.5%), and continuous positive airway pressure or bilevel positive airway pressure (3.5%). Two flight crew members out of 108 developed COVID that was presumed related to work. CONCLUSIONS: Air medical transport of patients with known or suspected COVID‐19 using routine PPE is considered effective for protecting medical crew members, even when patients are not intubated. This has implications for health care personnel in any setting that involves care of patients with COVID‐19 in similarly confined spaces.","Braude, Darren; Lauria, Michael; O'Donnell, Margaret; Shelly, Jodine; Berve, Michael; Torres, Mike; Olvera, Dave; Jarboe, Sean; Mazon, Anna; Dixon, Douglas",J Am Coll Emerg Physicians Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33728418/; https://doi.org/10.1002/emp2.12389,451

It is mainly diagnosed by pathological examination due to the lack of specific clinical and imaging manifestations. Whole-body positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) is widely used in determining clinical staging and guiding clinical treatment. As part of comprehensive treatment, targeted therapy with rituximab, intrathecal methotrexate injection and consolidation radiotherapy remain controversial in treating PB-DLBCL, but the comprehensive treatment based on full-course of chemotherapy is still widely used as the first-line treatment. Comprehensive treatment often leads to a sharp decline in the immunity of elderly patients with malignancy. In this situation, surgery may be a good chance to improve their life quality without serious complications. We present a rare case of PB-DLBCL during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The patient underwent chest CT scan to screen COVID-19 and a mass of left breast was accidentally found. Because of the city lockdown policy in Wuhan, she did not seek medical help until noticing that the mass was gradually enlarged. Both ultrasonography and mammography indicated that the lesion was breast cancer. However, ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of breast and PET-CT scan showed that the lesion was a primary hypermetabolic tumor of left breast. The patient subsequently received comprehensive treatment based on six cycles of rituximab-cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunomycin, oncovin, prednisone (R-CHOP) chemotherapy.","Chen, Maolin; Zhou, Jun; Qu, Xincai",J Med Cases,https://doi.org/10.14740/jmc3660; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34434454/,451

An online, self-administered, anonymous survey was distributed among Polish ophthalmology residents in early 2021. Of 126 residents who completed the survey, 71.4% indicated that they would get vaccinated, 17.5% were unsure, and 11.1% would refuse vaccination. Married respondents with children (p = 0.036) and respondents living with their families (p = 0.310) were more likely to accept vaccination, believing that the vaccine is effective (p = 0.002 and p = 0.001, respectively), and fearing for themselves (p = 0.031 and p = 0.023, respectively) or their families (p = 0.032 and 0.055, respectively) getting infected. Respondents who contracted COVID-19 often reported the expected relief in sanitization (p = 0.011) as their reason for vaccination, and the previous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (p = 0.050) as their reason for not vaccinating. Unmarried residents and residents living alone often declared that they were waiting for the effectiveness and long-term complications of the vaccine to be assessed (p = 0.005, both). Residents living with their families were significantly less likely to report COVID-19 as the reason for refusing vaccination (p = 0.022). In conclusion, most ophthalmology residents expressed a willingness to get vaccinated. Marital status and cohabitants affect vaccination acceptance. People with COVID-19 have different reasons for accepting or refusing vaccination. Medical authorities should persuade citizens more to vaccinate.","Konopińska, Joanna; Obuchowska, Iwona; Lisowski, Łukasz; Dub, Natalia; Kozera, Milena; Rękas, Marek",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33920462/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9040371,451
603822,The importation and establishment of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during the first eight weeks of the South African COVID-19 epidemic,2021-08-12,"Complex multicellular life in mammals relies on functional cooperation of different organs for the survival of the whole organism. The kidneys play a critical part in this process through the maintenance of fluid volume and composition homeostasis, which enables other organs to fulfil their tasks. The renal endothelium exhibits phenotypic and molecular traits that distinguish it from endothelia of other organs. Moreover, the adult kidney vasculature comprises diverse populations of mostly quiescent, but not metabolically inactive, endothelial cells (ECs) that reside within the kidney glomeruli, cortex and medulla. Each of these populations supports specific functions, for example, in the filtration of blood plasma, the reabsorption and secretion of water and solutes, and the concentration of urine. Transcriptional profiling of these diverse EC populations suggests they have adapted to local microenvironmental conditions (hypoxia, shear stress, hyperosmolarity), enabling them to support kidney functions. Exposure of ECs to microenvironment-derived angiogenic factors affects their metabolism, and sustains kidney development and homeostasis, whereas EC-derived angiocrine factors preserve distinct microenvironment niches. In the context of kidney disease, renal ECs show alteration in their metabolism and phenotype in response to pathological changes in the local microenvironment, further promoting kidney dysfunction. Understanding the diversity and specialization of kidney ECs could provide new avenues for the treatment of kidney diseases and kidney regeneration.","Dumas, Sébastien J.; Meta, Elda; Borri, Mila; Luo, Yonglun; Li, Xuri; Rabelink, Ton J.; Carmeliet, Peter",Nat Rev Nephrol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33767431/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41581-021-00411-9,451

METHODS: Patients with UUI and age-matched controls were evaluated pre- and post-treatment using OABSS, UDI-6 and IIQ-7. Controls were defined as having a cumulative OABSS of zero. Patients with UUI were treated with AC and followed for 12 weeks. Responders were those with a > 50% decrease in the total OABSS score. Urine samples were collected from all participants for evaluation. Metabolite detection was accomplished using commercial assay kits. Wilcoxon-rank sum test and Fisher’s exact test were used to express differences between groups. Spearman’s rho correlation coefficient was used to determine the relationship between acetylcholine (Ach), choline (Ch), acetylcholinesterase (AchE) and questionnaire scores. RESULTS: We recruited 39 with UUI and 33 controls. We found concentrations of Ch [29.0 (IQR: 24.2–42.5) μmol vs. 15.2 (IQR: 7.5–24.1) μmol] and Ach [65.8 (IQR: 30.4–101.8) nmol and 33.1 (IQR: 11.9–43.8) nmol] were higher in the UUI group compared to controls (p = 0.003 and p < 0.001, respectively] and no differences in AchE concentrations. In the UUI group, 43.6% responded to AC after 12 weeks of therapy. There were no differences in Ch or AchE levels between R and NR; Ach levels were higher in the R group [82.1 nmol (IQR: 54.8–118.1) vs. 50.3 nmol (IQR: 29.9–68.2), p = 0.007]. Ch and Ach were positively associated with pre-treatment OABSS parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Urine Ach is higher in responders to anti-cholinergic therapy, and urine cholinergic metabolites were higher in the UUI patients compared to controls.","Sheyn, David; Myers, Sara; Tucker, Dominique; Hazlett, Fred E.; Li, Xiaolin; Conroy, Britt; Hijaz, Adonis K.",Int Urogynecol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33818647/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-021-04785-z,451

In this study, we analyzed RNA-seq transcriptome data from Calu-3 human lung epithelial cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) compared to five other viruses namely, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-MERS), influenzavirus A (FLUA), influenzavirus B (FLUB), and rhinovirus (RHINO) compared to mock-infected cells and characterized their coding and noncoding RNA transcriptional portraits. The induction of interferon, inflammatory, and immune response was a hallmark of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Comprehensive bioinformatics revealed the activation of immune response and defense response to the virus as a common feature of viral infection. Interestingly however, the degree of functional categories and signaling pathways activation varied among different viruses. Ingenuity pathways analysis highlighted altered conical and casual pathways related to TNF, IL1A, and TLR7, which are seen more predominantly during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nonetheless, the activation of chemotaxis and lipid synthesis was prominent in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Despite the commonality among all viruses, our data revealed the hyperactivation of chemotaxis and immune cell trafficking as well as the enhanced fatty acid synthesis as plausible mechanisms that could explain the inflammatory cytokine storms associated with severe cases of COVID-19 and the rapid spread of the virus, respectively.","Shaath, Hibah; Alajez, Nehad M.",Biology (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32882823/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biology9090260,451

In 2011, South Africa embarked on a UHC journey to ensure that everyone has access to quality healthcare services without suffering financial impoverishment. National Health Insurance (NHI) and primary healthcare (PHC) re-engineering were two vehicles chosen to reach UHC over a 14-year period (2012–2026). The first phase of health system strengthening (HSS) initiatives to improve the quality of health services in the public sector began in 2012. These HSS initiatives are still being carried out by the Department of Health in conjunction with other partners. METHODS: A qualitative case study design utilising a theory of change (TOC) approach was employed. Data were collected from key informants (n = 71) during three phases: 2011–2012 (contextual mapping), 2013–2014 (Phase 1) and 2015 (Phase 2). In-depth face-to-face interviews were conducted with participants using a TOC interview guide, adapted for each phase. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. An iterative, inductive and deductive data analysis approach was utilised. Transcripts were coded with the aid of MAXQDA 2018. RESULTS: Six broad themes emerged: make PHC work, transform policy development, transform policy implementation, establish public–private partnerships, transform systems and processes and adopt a systems lens. CONCLUSION: A third great transition seems to be sweeping the globe, changing how health systems are organised. Actors in our study have identified this need also.

Thus, immunogenicity of novel SARS-CoV-2 vaccines might be impaired in this group. To determine immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with chronic dialysis, we analyzed the humoral and T-cell response after two doses of mRNA vaccine Tozinameran (BNT162b2 BioNTech/Pfizer). This observational study included 43 patients on dialysis before vaccination with two doses of Tozinameran 21 days apart. Overall, 36 patients completed the observation period until three weeks after the second dose and 32 patients were further analyzed at week 10. Serum samples were analyzed by SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgA antibodies ~1, ~3–4 and ~10 weeks after the second vaccination. In addition, SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses were assessed at ~3–4 weeks by an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). Antibody and T cell outcomes at this timepoint were compared to a group of 44 elderly patients not on dialysis, after immunization with Tozinameran. Median age of patients on chronic dialysis was 74.0 years (IQR 66.0, 82.0). The proportion of males was higher (69.4%) than females. Only 20/36 patients (55.6%, 95%CI: 38.29–71.67) developed SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies at the first sampling, whereas 32/36 patients (88.9%, 95%CI: 73.00–96.38) demonstrated IgG detection at the second sampling. In a longitudinal follow-up at ~10 weeks after the second dose, the proportion of dialysis patients reactive for anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG decreased to 27/32 (84.37%, 95%CI: 66.46–94.10) The proportion of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgA decreased from 33/36 (91.67%; 95%CI: 76.41–97.82) at weeks 3–4 down to 19/32 (59.38; 95%CI: 40.79–75.78). Compared to a cohort of vaccinees with similar age but not on chronic dialysis seroconversion rates and antibody titers were significantly lower. SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses 3 weeks after second vaccination were detected in 21/31 vaccinated dialysis patients (67.7%, 95%CI: 48.53–82.68) compared to 42/44 (93.3%, 95%CI: 76.49–98.84) in controls of similar age. Patients on dialysis demonstrate a delayed, but robust immune response three to four weeks after the second dose, which indicates effective vaccination of this vulnerable group. However, the lower immunogenicity of Tozinameran in these patients needs further attention to develop potential countermeasures such as an additional booster vaccination.","Schrezenmeier, Eva; Bergfeld, Leon; Hillus, David; Lippert, Joerg-Detlev; Weber, Ulrike; Tober-Lau, Pinkus; Landgraf, Irmgard; Schwarz, Tatjana; Kappert, Kai; Stefanski, Ana-Luisa; Sattler, Arne; Kotsch, Katja; Dörner, Thomas; Sander, Leif Erik; Budde, Klemens; Halleck, Fabian; Kurth, Florian; Corman, Victor Max; Choi, Mira",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.690698; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34276681/,451

PURPOSE: To evaluate whether use of hydroxychloroquine was associated with a reduced likelihood of intensive care unit (ICU) admission in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the early weeks of the pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective, observational, cohort study was conducted to determine selected treatment outcomes in 336 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at an acute care, community hospital in the Hudson Valley region of New York from March 20 to April 20, 2020. Eligibility included admission to the hospital, a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and no need for intubation or intensive care at admission. The median (interquartile range) ages of patients who received hydroxychloroquine (n = 188 ) and those who did not (n = 148) were 68 (58-82) and 64 (51-73) years, respectively. In a multivariable model that included age, gender, obesity, diabetes, and hydroxychloroquine use, patients who received hydroxychloroquine were significantly more likely than those not treated with the drug to be transferred to an ICU (odds ratio, [OR], 8.1; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.8-17) and significantly more likely to be intubated (OR, 7.99; 95% CI, 3.76-16.91); these associations were not influenced by disease severity. In-hospital mortality did not differ significantly with disease severity between those who did and those who did not receive hydroxychloroquine. CONCLUSION: Hydroxychloroquine use was significantly associated with increased risks of ICU admission and intubation in patients with mild, moderate, and severe symptoms of COVID-19. There were no significant between-group differences in mortality with use vs nonuse of hydroxychloroquine.","Awad, Nirvana; Schiller, Daryl S; Fulman, Magda; Chak, Azfar",Am J Health Syst Pharm,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxab056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33599721/,451

There is significant positive correlation (Pearson r) of state-level COVID-19 cases and deaths per million, respectively, with NCD risk factors- obesity (0.64, 0.52), hypertension (0.28, 0.16), diabetes (0.66, 0.46), literacy, NCD epidemiological transition index (0.58, 0.54) and ischemic heart disease mortality (0.22, 0.33). Correlation is also observed with indices of healthcare access and quality (0.71, 0.61), urbanization (0.75, 0.73) and human (0.61, 0.56) and sociodemographic (0.70, 0.69) development. Multivariate adjusted analyses shows strong correlation of COVID-19 burden and deaths with NCD risk factors (r(2) = 0.51, 0.43), NCDs (r(2) = 0.32, 0.16) and healthcare (r(2) = 0.52, 0.38). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 disease burden and mortality in India is ecologically associated with greater state-level burden of NCDs and risk factors, especially obesity and diabetes.","Gaur, Kiran; Khedar, Raghubir S.; Mangal, Kishore; Sharma, Arvind K.; Dhamija, Rajinder K.; Gupta, Rajeev",Diabetes Metab Syndr,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871402121000072; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2021.01.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33503583/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871402121000072?v=s5,451

Both were illustrious English leaders who as young men sustained multiple traumatic brain injuries, which may (or may not) have profoundly influenced their successes and failures of later years. Both men were admired and castigated; both struggled at various times with their bodies and their minds. Ultimately, one was initially a great man who descended as a flawed leader; the other was initially a flawed man who ascended as a great leader. Their similar yet contrasting case histories define the full spectrum (“Tudor-Churchill Spectrum”) of inter-individual variability in response to brain disease or injury.

This study evaluated if axillary ultrasound (US) coupled with fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) can accurately predict clinically relevant node metastasis in patients with breast cancer, and thus assist clinical decisions METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study with retrospective data collection of 241 individuals (239 women and 2 men) with unilateral operable breast cancer who were submitted to preoperative axillary assessment by physical exam, US and FNAC if suspicious nodes by imaging. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the methods. We compared the patient's characteristics using chi-square test, parametrics and non-parametrics statistics according to the variable. RESULTS The most sensible method was US (0.59; 95% CI, 0.50-0.69), and the most specific was US coupled with FNAC (0.97; 95% CI, 0.92-0.99). Only 2.7% of the patients with normal axillary US had more than 2 metastatic nodes in the axillary lymph node dissection, against 50% of the patients with suspicious lymph nodes in the US and positive FNAC. CONCLUSIONS Axillary US coupled with FNAC can sort patients who have a few metastatic nodes at most from those with heavy axillary burden and could be one more tool to initially evaluate patients and define treatment strategies.","Buzatto, Isabela Panzeri Carlotti; Dos Reis, Francisco José Cândido; de Andrade, Jurandyr Moreira; Rodrigues, Tamara Cristina Gomes Ferraz; Borba, Jéssica Maria Camargo; Netto, Amanda Homse; Polydoro, Marina Sconzo; Tiezzi, Daniel Guimarães",World journal of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12957-021-02391-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34583723/,451
610047,SARS-CoV-2 Detection by Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Testing: Analysis of False Positive Results and Recommendations for Quality Control Measures,2021-08-04,"Abstract The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak once again demonstrated the importance of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in patients with diabetes. Activation of the RAS increases in patients with diabetes. The virus attaches to the ACE2 enzyme at low cytosolic pH values and enters into the cell and causes infection. Especially in the presence of diabetes mellitus and accompanying comorbid conditions such as hypertension, obesity, old age, and smoking, cytosolic pH is low, thus the virus easily may enter the cell by attaching to ACE2. ACEIs and ARBs lead to a reduction in angiotensin II level by increasing the ACE2 level, thus they cause a low cytosolic pH. Increased cardiac ACE2 levels due to ACEIs and ARBs can trigger cardiac arrhythmias and myocarditis by causing the virus to easily enter the heart tissue. There is ACE2 activity in the rostral ventrolateral medulla in the brain stem. The release of angiotensin 1-7 in the brain stem leads to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system. This activation causes systemic vasoconstriction and the patient’s blood pressure increases. The most important event is the increased sympathetic activity via the central stimulation, this activity increases pulmonary capillary leaking, causing the ARDS. As the cytosolic pH, which is already low in patients with diabetes will decrease further with the mechanisms mentioned above, the viral load will increase and the infection will be exacerbated. As a result, the use of ACEIs and ARBs in patients with diabetes can lead to increased morbidity and mortality of COVID-19.","Cure, Erkan; Cumhur Cure, Medine",Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research & Reviews,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32311651/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.019; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871402120300850; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871402120300850,451

611322,Potential implications of SARS-CoV-2 on pregnancy,2020-05-13,"Following successful non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) aiming to control COVID-19, many jurisdictions reopened their economies and borders. As little immunity had developed in most populations, re-establishing higher contact carried substantial risks, and therefore many locations began to see resurgence in COVID-19 cases. We present a Bayesian method to estimate the leeway to reopen, or alternatively the strength of change required to re-establish COVID-19 control, in a range of jurisdictions experiencing different COVID-19 epidemics. We estimated the timing and strength of initial control measures such as widespread distancing and compared the leeway jurisdictions had to reopen immediately after NPI measures to later estimates of leeway. Finally, we quantified risks associated with reopening and the likely burden of new cases due to introductions from other jurisdictions. We found widely varying leeway to reopen. After initial NPI measures took effect, some jurisdictions had substantial leeway (e.g., Japan, New Zealand, Germany) with > 0.99 probability that contact rates were below 80% of the threshold for epidemic growth. Others had little leeway (e.g., the United Kingdom, Washington State) and some had none (e.g., Sweden, California). For most such regions, increases in contact rate of 1.5–2 fold would have had high (> 0.7) probability of exceeding past peak sizes. Most jurisdictions experienced June–August trajectories consistent with our projections of contact rate increases of 1–2-fold. Under such relaxation scenarios for some regions, we projected up to [Formula: see text] 100 additional cases if just one case were imported per week over six weeks, even between jurisdictions with comparable COVID-19 risk. We provide an R package ’covidseir’ to enable jurisdictions to estimate leeway and forecast cases under different future contact patterns. Estimates of leeway can provide a quantitative basis for decisions about reopening. We recommend a cautious approach to reopening economies and borders, coupled with strong monitoring for changes in transmission.","Anderson, Sean C.; Mulberry, Nicola; Edwards, Andrew M.; Stockdale, Jessica E.; Iyaniwura, Sarafa A.; Falcao, Rebeca C.; Otterstatter, Michael C.; Janjua, Naveed Z.; Coombs, Daniel; Colijn, Caroline",Epidemics,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1755436521000141; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2021.100453; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33971429/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436521000141?v=s5,451
611982,A double edged-sword - The Complement System during SARS-CoV-2 infection,2021-05-01,"Increasing evidence highlights the importance of the antiviral activities of the type III interferons (IFNλs; IL-28A, IL-28B, IL29, and IFNλ4) in the intestine. However, many viruses have developed strategies to counteract these defense mechanisms by preventing the production of IFNs. Here we use infection models, a clinical virus isolate, and several molecular biology techniques to demonstrate that both type I and III IFNs induce an antiviral state and attenuate Coxsackievirus group B (CVB) replication in human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). While treatment of IECs with a viral mimic (poly (I:C)) induced a robust expression of both type I and III IFNs, no such up-regulation was observed after CVB infection. The blunted IFN response was paralleled by a reduction in the abundance of proteins involved in the induction of interferon gene transcription, including TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF), mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), and the global protein translation initiator eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G). Taken together, this study highlights a potent anti-Coxsackieviral effect of both type I and III IFNs in cells located at the primary site of infection. Furthermore, we show for the first time that the production of type I and III IFNs in IECs is blocked by CVBs. These findings suggest that CVBs evade the host immune response in order to successfully infect the intestine.","Stone, Virginia M.; Ringqvist, Emma E.; Larsson, Pär G.; Domsgen, Erna; Holmlund, Ulrika; Sverremark-Ekström, Eva; Flodström-Tullberg, Malin",Microorganisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33466313/; https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9010105,451

In order to predict in advance which patients could be more susceptible to develop a critical form of COVID-19, it is essential to define the most adequate biomarkers. In this study, we analyzed several parameters related to the cellular immune response in blood samples from 109 patients with different presentations of COVID-19 who were recruited in Hospitals and Primary Healthcare Centers in Madrid, Spain, during the first pandemic peak between April and June 2020. Hospitalized patients with the most severe forms of COVID-19 showed a potent inflammatory response that was not translated into an efficient immune response. Despite the high levels of effector cytotoxic cell populations such as NK, NKT and CD8+ T cells, they displayed immune exhaustion markers and poor cytotoxic functionality against target cells infected with pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 or cells lacking MHC class I molecules. Moreover, patients with critical COVID-19 showed low levels of the highly cytotoxic TCRγδ+ CD8+ T cell subpopulation. Conversely, CD4 count was greatly reduced in association to high levels of Tregs, low plasma IL-2 and impaired Th1 differentiation. The relative importance of these immunological parameters to predict COVID-19 severity was analyzed by Random Forest algorithm and we concluded that the most important features were related to an efficient cytotoxic response. Therefore, efforts to fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection should be focused not only to decrease the disproportionate inflammatory response, but also to elicit an efficient cytotoxic response against the infected cells and to reduce viral replication.","Vigón, Lorena; Fuertes, Daniel; García-Pérez, Javier; Torres, Montserrat; Rodríguez-Mora, Sara; Mateos, Elena; Corona, Magdalena; Saez-Marín, Adolfo J.; Malo, Rosa; Navarro, Cristina; Murciano-Antón, María Aranzazu; Cervero, Miguel; Alcamí, José; García-Gutiérrez, Valentín; Planelles, Vicente; López-Huertas, María Rosa; Coiras, Mayte",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34122423/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.665329,451

(2019) used their EpiRank algorithm, which emphasizes forward-and-backward commuter flow between homes and workplaces, to analyze the distribution patterns of two infectious diseases in Taiwan: the 2009-H1N1 influenza virus and the widespread emergence of the 2000-2008 type 71 enterovirus (EV). As this article was being prepared, the spreading mechanism of the novel coronavirus disease now designated as COVID-19 had yet to be identified, but according to the American Centers for Disease Control, its spreading mechanism and patterns are likely more similar to influenza than to other coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV). To consider potential COVID-19 spatial patterns, we applied EpiRank to the 2003 SARS outbreak in north Taiwan for comparison with H1N1 and EV. SARS was found to be less contagious than H1N1 or EV, but with a significantly higher fatality rate. The characteristics of these diseases determined their specific spatial spreading patterns, as reflected in the different effects of forward and backward commuting movement. Our motivation is to highlight these differences and to illustrate EpiRank spatial patterns for the 2003 SARS outbreak for comparison with EpiRank-determined distributions for the H1N1 and EV outbreaks. Our results indicate that the daytime parameter (i.e., forward movement effect) range was slightly higher (0.5-0.55) for the SARS outbreak than for either the influenza (0.4-0.5) or EV (0.3-0.5) outbreaks, suggesting that the forward-and-backward movements of individuals between residential and core urban areas with concentrated populations were equally important regarding the spread of SARS. While COVID-19 might resemble either SARS or H1N1 in terms of spatial spreading, its daytime parameter is likely somewhere in-between, with backward movement being dominant (similar to H1N1) or with forward and backward movement being equally important (similar to SARS).

Patients can suffer acute severe pain and may have long-term mental, cognitive, and functional health deterioration after discharge. However, few controlled trials are evaluating interventions for the prevention and treatment of PICS. The study hypothesis is that a specific care program based on early therapeutic education and psychological intervention improves the quality of life of patients at risk of developing PICS and chronic pain after COVID-19. The primary objective is to determine whether the program is superior to standard-of-care on health-related quality of life at 6 months after hospital discharge. The secondary objectives are to determine whether the intervention is superior to standard-of-care on health-related quality of life, incidence of chronic pain and degree of functional limitation, incidence of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress syndrome at 3 and 6 months after hospital discharge. METHODS: The PAINCOVID trial is a unicentric randomized, controlled, patient-blinded superiority trial with two parallel groups. The primary endpoint is the health-related quality of life at 6 months after hospital discharge, and randomization will be performed with a 1:1 allocation ratio. This paper details the methodology and statistical analysis plan of the trial and was submitted before outcome data were available. The estimated sample size is 84 patients, 42 for each arm. Assuming a lost to follow-up rate of 20%, a sample size of 102 patients is necessary (51 for each arm). DISCUSSION: This is the first randomized clinical trial assessing the effectiveness of an early care therapeutic education, and psychological intervention program for the management of PICS and chronic pain after COVID-19. The intervention will serve as proof of the need to implement early care programs at an early stage, having an incalculable impact given the current scenario of the pandemic.

What limits the potential of the use of peptides as drugs is their low bioavailability and enzymatic degradation in vivo. To overcome this limitation, the development of new molecules mimicking peptides is of great importance for the development of new biologically active molecules. Therefore, replacing the amide bond in a peptide with a heterocyclic bioisostere, such as the 1,2,3-triazole ring, can be considered an effective solution for the synthesis of biologically relevant peptidomimetics. These 1,2,3-triazoles may have an interesting biological activity, because they behave as rigid link units, which can mimic the electronic properties of amide bonds and show bioisosteric effects.

620546,Subtle olfactory dysfunction after SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in children(),2020-12-01,"The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global pandemic that threatens to bring long-term changes worldwide. Approximately 80% of infected patients are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms such as fever or cough, while rest of the patients have varying degrees of severity of symptoms, with 3-4% mortality rate. Severe symptoms such as pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome can be caused by tissue damage mostly due to aggravated and unresolved innate and adaptive immune response, often resulting from a cytokine storm. However, the mechanistic underpinnings of such responses remain elusive, with an incomplete understanding of how an intricate interplay among infected cells and cells of innate and adaptive immune system can lead to such diverse clinicopathological outcomes. Here, we use a dynamical systems approach to dissect the emergent nonlinear intra-host dynamics among virally infected cells, the immune response to it and the consequent immunopathology. By mechanistic analysis of cell-cell interactions, we have identified key parameters affecting the diverse clinical phenotypes associated with COVID-19. This minimalistic yet rigorous model can explain the various phenotypes observed across the clinical spectrum of COVID-19, various co-morbidity risk factors such as age and obesity, and the effect of antiviral drugs on different phenotypes. It also reveals how a fine-tuned balance of infected cell killing and resolution of inflammation can lead to infection clearance, while disruptions can drive different severe phenotypes. These results will help further the case of rational selection of drug combinations that can effectively balance viral clearance and minimize tissue damage simultaneously. Significance Statement The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has already infected millions of people, and thousands of lives have been lost to it. The pandemic has already tested the limits of our public healthcare systems with a wide spectrum of clinicopathological symptoms and outcomes. The mechanistic underpinnings of the resultant immunopathology caused by the viral infection still remains to be elucidated. Here we propose a minimalistic but rigorous description of the interactions of the virus infected cells and the core components of the immune system that can potentially explain such diversity in the observed clinical outcomes. Our proposed framework could enable a platform to determine the efficacy of various treatment combinations and can contributes a conceptual understanding of dynamics of disease pathogenesis in SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Sahoo, Sarthak; Hari, Kishore; Jhunjhunwala, Siddharth; Jolly, Mohit Kumar",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.16.097238,451
620791,Initial Presentation of a Pediatric Intestinal Pseudo-Obstruction Episode After SARS-CoV-2 Virus (COVID-19) Infection,2021-04-12,"ADP-ribosylation is a common posttranslational modification that may have antiviral properties and impact innate immunity. To regulate this activity, macrodomain proteins enzymatically remove covalently attached ADP-ribose from protein targets. All members of the Coronavirinae, a subfamily of positive-sense RNA viruses, contain a highly conserved macrodomain within nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3). However, its function or targets during infection remain unknown. We identified several macrodomain mutations that greatly reduced nsp3’s de-ADP-ribosylation activity in vitro. Next, we created recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) strains with these mutations. These mutations led to virus attenuation and a modest reduction of viral loads in infected mice, despite normal replication in cell culture. Further, macrodomain mutant virus elicited an early, enhanced interferon (IFN), interferon-stimulated gene (ISG), and proinflammatory cytokine response in mice and in a human bronchial epithelial cell line. Using a coinfection assay, we found that inclusion of mutant virus in the inoculum protected mice from an otherwise lethal SARS-CoV infection without reducing virus loads, indicating that the changes in innate immune response were physiologically significant. In conclusion, we have established a novel function for the SARS-CoV macrodomain that implicates ADP-ribose in the regulation of the innate immune response and helps to demonstrate why this domain is conserved in CoVs.","Fehr, Anthony R.; Channappanavar, Rudragouda; Jankevicius, Gytis; Fett, Craig; Zhao, Jincun; Athmer, Jeremiah; Meyerholz, David K.; Ahel, Ivan; Perlman, Stanley",mBio,https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01721-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27965448/,451

The objective of this study was to examine health and coping behaviors, such as smoking and alcohol consumption as well as stress management techniques, among health care workers consisting of gendered, racialized, and immigrant employees. Methods: Drawing on a single-case, mixed-methods study in Ontario, Canada, this paper presents under-researched data about smoking practices, alcohol consumption, and stress management techniques among health care workers in labor-intensive, high-stress, high-turnover environments. In particular, it identifies the various mechanisms for maintaining health and well-being. Results: The findings suggest that 7.7% of survey respondents reported smoking while 43.4% reported alcohol consumption, which were reported more frequently among immigrants than among non-immigrants. Participants also reported health-promoting activities in face-to-face interviews, such as mindful breathing techniques and drawing upon social support, while a few respondents reported alcohol consumption to specifically cope with sleep disturbances and job stress. Conclusions: Although smoking and alcohol consumption were both connected with coping strategies and leisure, they were predominant in immigrant groups compared to non-immigrant groups.","Syed, Iffath Unissa",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32825001/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176027,451

In this study, we examined the immunogenicity of CHO-expressed recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S1-Fc fusion protein in mice, rabbits, and monkeys as a potential candidate for a COVID-19 vaccine. We demonstrate that the S1-Fc fusion protein is extremely immunogenic, as evidenced by strong antibody titers observed by day 7. Strong virus neutralizing activity was observed on day 14 in rabbits immunized with the S1-Fc fusion protein using a pseudovirus neutralization assay. Most importantly, in less than 20 days and three injections of the S1-Fc fusion protein, two monkeys developed higher virus neutralizing titers than a recovered COVID-19 patient in a live SARS-CoV-2 infection assay. Our data strongly suggests that the CHO-expressed SARS-CoV-2 S1-Fc recombinant protein could be a strong candidate for vaccine development against COVID-19.","Ren, Wenlin; Sun, Hunter; Gao, George F.; Chen, Jianxin; Sun, Sean; Zhao, Rongqing; Gao, Guang; Hu, Yalin; Zhao, Gan; Chen, Yuxin; Jin, Xia; Fang, Feng; Chen, Jinggong; Wang, Qi; Gong, Sitao; Gao, Wen; Sun, Yufei; Su, Junchi; He, Ailiang; Cheng, Xin; Li, Min; Xia, Chenxi; Li, Maohua; Sun, Le",Vaccine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32651113/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X20308525?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.06.066; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X20308525,451

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this work is to describe the isolation and propagation properties of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the first confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Brazil. METHODS: After diagnosis in patients that returned from Italy to the São Paulo city in late February by RT-PCR, SARS-CoV-2 isolates were obtained in cell cultures and characterised by full genome sequencing, electron microscopy and in vitro replication properties. FINDINGS: The virus isolate was recovered from nasopharyngeal specimen, propagated in Vero cells (E6, CCL-81 and hSLAM), with clear cytopathic effects, and characterised by full genome sequencing, electron microscopy and in vitro replication properties.

622678,Stapled Peptides Based on Human Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) Potently Inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Infection In Vitro,2020-12-11,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The study objective was to determine if an SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism)-based immune multi-gene panel has the ability to predict adjuvant BCG (Bacillus Calmette–Guérin) immunotherapy responsiveness post-tumor resection in AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) stages III and IV metastatic melanoma patients. A pilot study followed by further verification and control melanoma patient cohorts involving three phase III multicenter clinical trials was used to verify if an immune gene SNP panel could identify if adjuvant BCG therapy correlates with disease outcomes. We found a specific immune gene SNP panel that could identify which patients would respond to adjuvant BCG immunotherapy, but it was not applicable in the control non-immunotherapy treated patients. These studies provide evidence that SNP immune-gene assessment has utility in predicting melanoma patient’s immunotherapy responses to adjuvant BCG immunotherapy. ABSTRACT: Adjuvant immunotherapy in melanoma patients improves clinical outcomes. However, success is unpredictable due to inherited heterogeneity of immune responses. Inherent immune genes associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may influence anti-tumor immune responses. We assessed the predictive ability of 26 immune-gene SNPs genomic panels for a clinical response to adjuvant BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) immunotherapy, using melanoma patient cohorts derived from three phase III multicenter clinical trials: AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) stage IV patients given adjuvant BCG (pilot cohort; n = 92), AJCC stage III patients given adjuvant BCG (verification cohort; n = 269), and AJCC stage III patients that are sentinel lymph node (SLN) positive receiving no immunotherapy (control cohort; n = 80). The SNP panel analysis demonstrated that the responder patient group had an improved disease-free survival (DFS) (hazard ratio [HR] 1.84, 95% CI 1.09–3.13, p = 0.021) in the pilot cohort. In the verification cohort, an improved overall survival (OS) (HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.07–2.67, p = 0.025) was observed. No significant differences of SNPs were observed in DFS or OS in the control patient cohort. This study demonstrates that SNP immune genes can be utilized as a predictive tool for identifying melanoma patients that are inherently responsive to BCG and potentially other immunotherapies in the future.","Ramos, Romela Irene; Shaw, Misa A.; Foshag, Leland; Stern, Stacey L.; Rahimzadeh, Negin; Elashoff, David; Hoon, Dave S.

623394,Seroprevalence of IgG antibodies against SARS coronavirus 2 in Belgium: a prospective cross-sectional study of residual samples,2020-06-09,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Functional gastrointestinal disorders are a group of stress‐sensitive gut–brain disorders. The COVID‐19 outbreak has caused immense stress and anxiety among the general public. Strict measures to counter COVID‐19 emergency, including physical distancing, have also taken a toll on physical and mental health. We investigated the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on the gastrointestinal and psychological symptoms of functional dyspepsia (FD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: An online survey was conducted in Japan for a group of randomly assigned panelists from May 26 to 27, 2020. Each respondent answered a questionnaire on stress, physical distancing, and worries about COVID‐19. Gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed to diagnose FD and IBS (Rome III), and psychological symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS: A total of 5157 subjects were finally enrolled, with FD in 8.5%, IBS in 16.6%, and FD–IBS overlap in 4.0%. For both gastrointestinal and psychological symptoms, respondents with FD–IBS overlap showed the worst scores, followed by IBS‐alone, then FD‐alone respondents. During the COVID‐19 pandemic, 11.9% of respondents reported deterioration and 2.8% reported improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms. FD–IBS overlap, psychological disease comorbidity, and stress at work/school were significantly associated with symptom deterioration. Younger age, commuting by public transport, and work/study from home were associated with symptom improvement. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID‐19 pandemic negatively affected FD/IBS subjects, with respondents showing FD–IBS overlap syndrome as the most important independent factor associated with deterioration in gastrointestinal symptoms. Physicians need to take extra care of FD/IBS patients in the post‐COVID period.","Oshima, Tadayuki; Siah, Kewin Tien Ho; Yoshimoto, Takanori; Miura, Ko; Tomita, Toshihiko; Fukui, Hirokazu; Miwa, Hiroto",J Gastroenterol Hepatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197076/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jgh.15346,451

Therefore, this research aims to identify the most frequent symptoms and comorbidities in SARS‐CoV‐2 infected outpatients; besides, to analyze hematological parameters and their correlation with cycle threshold (Ct) values. METHODS: We analyzed a total of sixty outpatients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. They were divided according to sex. Afterward, a questionnaire was carried out to find out their symptoms and comorbidities. Additionally, blood biometry data were correlated with the Ct value, respectively. RESULTS: Sixty patients were analyzed; the mean age was 43 years. All patients were from Nayarit, Mexico. The frequency index showed that the main symptoms were headache and anosmia, and the comorbidities were obesity and smoking. The analysis of blood biometry showed a clear increase in red blood cells (RBC) related parameters in women. In both sexes an increase in the number of white blood cells (WBC) was observed. Also, all the hematological alterations correlated with the grade of infection. CONCLUSION: Headache and anosmia are the most common symptoms according to the frequency index, the main comorbidities were obesity and smoking. Also, there is a Ct value correlation with hematological parameters (WBC, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, hemoglobin); they can be used as a prognostic marker of infection.","Girón‐Pérez, Daniel Alberto; Benitez‐Trinidad, Alma Betsaida; Ruiz‐Manzano, Rocio Alejandra; Toledo‐Ibarra, Gladys Alejandra; Ventura‐Ramón, Guadalupe Herminia; Covantes‐Rosales, Carlos Eduardo; Ojeda‐Durán, Ansonny Jhovany; Díaz‐Reséndiz, Karina Janice Guadalupe; Mercado‐Salgado, Ulises; Girón‐Pérez, Manuel Iván",Int J Lab Hematol,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijlh.13606; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34075710/,451

The translocation of apo B100 into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and its subsequent assembly into lipoprotein particles is of particular interest as the protein is both very large (relative molecular mass 512,000) and insoluble in water. It has been proposed that apo B translocation occurs in discrete stages and is completed post-translationally(1). Several sites of arrest of translocation were reported to be present in apo B15 (the N-terminal 15% of the protein). We have re-examined this question by in vitro translation coupled with translocation into microsomes, and find no evidence for transmembrane segments in truncated apo B proteins. Translocated apo B17 is strongly associated with the membrane-of the ER, being only partially releasable with alkaline carbonate, and remaining bound to the microsomes following disruption with saponin. The efficient binding of short segments of apo B, despite the absence of transmembrane domains, suggests that apo B is cotranslationally inserted into the inner leaflet of the ER. This will obviate problems caused by the size and insolubility of apo B100, because the growing hydrophobic protein chains will never exist in a lipid-free form during translocation. From the inner leaflet, apo B in association with membrane-derived lipid can bud into the lumen of the ER to form nascent lipoprotein particles.","Pease, Richard J.; Harrison, Georgina B.; Scott, James",Nature,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1896087/,451

Here we quantify immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG) antibodies recognizing the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein, and neutralizing antibodies during a period of 6 months from COVID-19 disease onset in 349 symptomatic COVID-19 patients who were among the first be infected world-wide. The positivity rate and magnitude of IgM-S and IgG-N responses increase rapidly. High levels of IgM-S/N and IgG-S/N at 2-3 weeks after disease onset are associated with virus control and IgG-S titers correlate closely with the capacity to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Although specific IgM-S/N become undetectable 12 weeks after disease onset in most patients, IgG-S/N titers have an intermediate contraction phase, but stabilize at relatively high levels over the 6 month observation period. At late time points, the positivity rates for binding and neutralizing SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies are still >70%.

At present standard treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not well defined because the evidence, either from randomized or observational studies, with conflicting results, has led to rapid changes in treatment guidelines. Our aim was to narratively summarize the available literature on the management of COVID-19 in order to combine current evidence and interpretation of the data by experts who are treating patients in the frontline setting. METHODS: The panel conducted a detailed review of the literature and eventual press releases from randomized clinical trials for each possible available treatment. Inductive PubMed search waws performed for publications relevant to the topic, including all clinical trials conducted. The result was a flowchart with treatment indications for patients with COVID-19. IMPLICATIONS: After 6 months of a pandemic situation and before a possible second coronavirus wave descends on Europe, it is important to evaluate which drugs proved to be effective while also considering that results from many randomized clinical trials are still awaited. Indeed, among treatments for COVID-19, only glucocorticoids have resulted in an association with a significant decrease in mortality in published randomized controlled trials.

625361,The rise of point-of-care genetics: how the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will accelerate adoption of genetic testing in the acute setting,2021-02-15,"Abstract The current changes in vehicle movement due to ‘lockdown’ conditions (imposed in cities worldwide in response to the COVID-19 epidemic) provide opportunities to quantify the local impact of ‘controlled interventions’ on air quality and establish baseline pollution concentrations in cities. Here, we present a case study from Auckland, New Zealand, an isolated Southern Hemisphere city, which is largely unaffected by long-range pollution transport or industrial sources of air pollution. In this city, traffic flows reduced by 60–80% as a result of a government-led initiative to contain the virus by limiting all transport to only essential services. In this paper, ambient pollutant concentrations of NO2, O3, BC, PM2.5, and PM10 are compared between the lockdown period and comparable periods in the historical air pollution record, while taking into account changes in the local meteorology. We show that this ‘natural experiment’ in source emission reductions had significant but non-linear impacts on air quality. While emission inventories and receptor modelling approaches confirm the dominance of traffic sources for NOx (86%), and BC (72%) across the city, observations suggest a consequent reduction in NO2 of only 34–57% and a reduction in BC of 55–75%. The observed reductions in PM2.5 (still likely to be dominated by traffic emissions), and PM10 (dominated by sea salt, traffic emissions to a lesser extent, and affected by seasonality) were found to be significantly less (8–17% for PM2.5 and 7–20% for PM10). The impact of this unplanned controlled intervention shows the importance of establishing accurate, local-scale emission inventories, and the potential of the local atmospheric chemistry and meteorology in limiting their accuracy.","Patel, Hamesh; Talbot, Nick; Salmond, Jennifer; Dirks, Kim; Xie, Shanju; Davy, Perry",Sci Total Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32745857/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720346581?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720346581; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141129,451

626613,Coinfection of SARS-CoV-2 and Other Respiratory Pathogens,2020-08-26,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) exhibits a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations. Despite the fact that SARS-CoV-2 has slower evolutionary rate than other coronaviruses, different mutational hotspots have been identified along the SARS-CoV-2 genome. METHODS: We performed whole-genome high throughput sequencing on isolates from 50 Egyptian patients to see if the variation in clinical symptoms was related to mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Then, we investigated the relationship between the observed mutations and the clinical characteristics of the patients. RESULTS: Among the 36 most common mutations, we found two frameshift deletions linked to an increased risk of shortness of breath, a V6 deletion in the spike glycoprotein's signal peptide region linked to an increased risk of fever, longer fever duration and nasal congestion, and L3606-nsp6 deletion linked to a higher prevalence of cough and conjunctival congestion. S5398L nsp13-helicase was linked to an increased risk of fever duration and progression. The most common mutations (241, 3037, 14,408, and 23,403) were not linked to clinical variability. However, the E3909G-nsp7 variant was more common in children (2–13 years old) and was associated with a shorter duration of symptoms. The duration of fever was significantly reduced with E1363D-nsp3 and E3073A-nsp4. CONCLUSIONS: The most common mutations, D614G/spike-glycoprotein and P4715L/RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase, were linked to transmissibility regardless of symptom variability. E3909G-nsp7 could explain why children recover so quickly. Nsp6-L3606fs, spike-glycoprotein-V6fs, and nsp13-S5398L variants may be linked to clinical symptom worsening. These variations related to host-virus interactions might open new therapeutic avenues for symptom relief and disease containment.","Zekri, Abdel-Rahman N.; Mohanad, Marwa; Hafez, Mohammed M.; Soliman, Hany K.; Hassan, Zainab K.; Abouelhoda, Mohamed; Amer, Khaled E.; Seadawy, Mohamed G.; Ahmed, Ola S.",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Basis Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932525/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925443921000879?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0925443921000879; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbadis.2021.166154,451
626772,Point-of-Care Toolkit for Multiplex Molecular Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A and B Viruses,2021-09-15,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the potential of shared sporting equipment as transmission vectors of SARS-CoV-2 during the reintroduction of sports such as soccer, rugby, cricket, tennis, golf and gymnastics. SETTING: Laboratory based live SARS-CoV-2 virus study. INTERVENTIONS: Ten different types of sporting equipment were inoculated with 40l droplets containing clinically relevant high and low concentrations of live SARS-CoV-2 virus. Materials were then swabbed at time points relevant to sports (1, 5, 15, 30, 90 minutes). The amount of live SARS-CoV-2 recovered at each time point was enumerated using viral plaque assays, and viral decay and half-life was estimated through fitting linear models to log transformed data from each material. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome measure was quantification of retrievable SARS-CoV-2 virus from each piece of equipment at pre-determined time points. RESULTS: At one minute, SARS-CoV-2 virus was recovered in only seven of the ten types of equipment with the low dose inoculum, one at five minutes and none at 15 minutes. Retrievable virus dropped significantly for all materials tested using the high dose inoculum with mean recovery of virus falling to 0.74% at 1 minute, 0.39% at 15 minutes and 0.003% at 90 minutes. Viral recovery, predicted decay, and half-life varied between materials with porous surfaces limiting virus transmission. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that there is an exponential reduction in SARS-CoV-2 recoverable from a range of sports equipment after a short time period, and virus is less transferrable from materials such as a tennis ball, red cricket ball and cricket glove. Given this rapid loss of viral load and the fact that transmission requires a significant inoculum to be transferred from equipment to the mucous membranes of another individual it seems unlikely that sports equipment is a major cause for transmission of SARS-CoV-2. These findings have important policy implications in the context of the pandemic and may promote other infection control measures in sports to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and urge sports equipment manufacturers to identify surfaces that may or may not be likely to retain transferable virus.","Edwards, T.; Kay, G.

Here we aim to untangle factors that are associated with the differences during the first quarter of the year 2020. Number of performed COVID-19 tests has a strong correlation with country-specific incidence (p <2×10-16) and mortality rate (p = 5.1×10-8). Using multivariate linear regression we show that incidence and mortality rates correlate significantly with GDP per capita (p = 2.6×10-15 and 7.0×10-4, respectively), country-specific duration of the outbreak (2.6×10-4 and 0.0019), fraction of citizens over 65 years old (p = 0.0049 and 3.8×10-4) and level of press freedom (p = 0.021 and 0.019) which cumulatively explain 80% of variability of incidence and more than 60% of variability of mortality of the disease during the period analyzed. Country hemisphere demonstrated significant correlation only with mortality (p = 0.17 and 0.036) whereas population density (p = 0.94 and p = 0.75) and latitude (p = 0.61 and 0.059) did not reach significance in our model. Case fatality rate is shown to rise as the outbreak progresses (p = 0.028). We rank countries by COVID-19 mortality corrected for incidence and the factors that were shown to affect it, and by CFR corrected for outbreak duration, yielding very similar results. Among the countries where the outbreak started after the 15th of February and with at least 1000 registered patients during the period analyzed, the lowest corrected CFR are seen in Israel, South Africa and Chile. The ranking results should be considered with caution as they do not consider all confounding factors or data reporting biases.","Shagam, Lev",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.22.20075580v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.22.20075580,451

628435,Pooling for SARS-CoV2 Surveillance: Validation and Strategy for Implementation in K-12 Schools,2020-12-16,"Biotinidase (BTD) deficiency is an autosomal recessive inherited neurocutaneous disorder. BTD recycles the vitamin biotin, a coenzyme essential for the function of four biotin-dependent carboxylases, including propionyl-CoA carboxylase, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, pyruvate carboxylase, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Due to deficient activities of the carboxylases, BTD deficiency is also recognized as late-onset multiple carboxylase deficiency and is associated with secondary alterations in the metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, and fatty acids. BTD deficiency can be classified as “profound”, with less than 10% of mean normal activity, and as “partial” with 10–30% of mean normal activity. Newborn screening (NBS) of BTD deficiency is performed in most countries and is able to detect both variants. Moreover, mild metabolic alterations related to carboxylase deficiency in profound BTD deficiency could result and possibly be revealed in the metabolic profile by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) NBS. Here, we report the case of a newborn female infant with an initial suspected BTD deficiency at the NBS test, finally confirmed as a partial variant by molecular testing. Although BTD deficiency was partial, interestingly her metabolic profile at birth and during the follow-up tests revealed, for the first time, alterations in specific acylcarnitines as a possible result of the deficient activity of biotin-dependent carboxylases.","Cicalini, Ilaria; Pieragostino, Damiana; Rizzo, Cristiano; Verrocchio, Sara; Semeraro, Daniela; Zucchelli, Mirco; Di Michele, Silvia; Dionisi-Vici, Carlo; Stuppia, Liborio; De Laurenzi, Vincenzo; Bucci, Ines; Rossi, Claudia",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33572391/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18041659,451

SETTING/DESIGN: Secondary analysis of international published data. DATA SOURCES: Meta-analysis of COVID-19 incubation period and a rapid review of serial interval and generation time, which are published separately. PARTICIPANTS: Data from China, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Italy, Republic of Korea, Singapore and Vietnam from December 2019 to May 2020. METHODS: Simulations were generated of incubation period and of serial interval or generation time. From these, transmission times relative to symptom onset, and the proportion of presymptomatic transmission, were estimated. OUTCOME MEASURES: Transmission time of SARS-CoV-2 relative to symptom onset and proportion of presymptomatic transmission. RESULTS: Based on 18 serial interval/generation time estimates from 15 papers, mean transmission time relative to symptom onset ranged from −2.6 (95% CI −3.0 to –2.1) days before infector symptom onset to 1.4 (95% CI 1.0 to 1.8) days after symptom onset. The proportion of presymptomatic transmission ranged from 45.9% (95% CI 42.9% to 49.0%) to 69.1% (95% CI 66.2% to 71.9%). CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial potential for presymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 across a range of different contexts. This highlights the need for rapid case detection, contact tracing and quarantine.

630146,Impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on emergency surgery services—a multi-national survey among WSES members,2020-12-09,"BACKGROUND: Pacific Islanders (PIs), an indigenous, diverse population in the USA, have endured generational burdens of Western colonization and institutional racism that placed this population at socioeconomic and health disadvantages, such as in poverty, chronic disease, and now COVID-19. However, little is known about the impact of COVID-19 on this historically disadvantaged population. This study assessed the extent US PIs have been adversely affected by COVID-19 across the 50 states. METHODS: Using state-level national data as of September 9th, 2020, we conducted a secondary-data analysis of COVID-19 cases and deaths in PIs relative to their population representation and other racial groups, case odds ratios, and age-adjusted standard mortality ratios. KEY RESULTS: Only 46% of states reported PI cases and 36% of states reported PI deaths. Of 23 states with available data on PIs, PIs were overrepresented in COVID-19 cases and deaths relative to their population representation in 21 and 14 states, respectively. The proportion of COVID-19 cases and deaths to the PI population was highest among all racial groups in 15 and 9 states, respectively. PIs had higher odds of exposure to COVID-19 than Whites in 21 of 23 states, and higher number of observed deaths than expected in 6 of 7 states with available PI data.

The assessment was based on questionnaires filled out by 3674 Czech dentists representing 42.6% of practicing dentists in the country. During March–May, 2020 (the first COVID-19 wave), 90.7% of dental practices remained open; however, only 22.8% of the practices continued to operate with no changes, 46.5% had fewer patients, 21.4% treated only acute cases, and 3.8% were closed. During September 2020–May 2021 (the second wave of COVID-19), 96.1% of dental practices remained open, 60.8% operated with no changes, 34.5% had fewer patients, 0.8% treated only acute cases, and 0.5% were closed. The reasons leading to the closure of Czech dental practices during the whole pandemic were a shortage of personal protective equipment (50.5%), a COVID-19 outbreak in the workplace (24.5%), fear of a possible self-infection (24.0%), and quarantine (20.5%). The time range of Czech dental practices closure during the whole pandemic was: 1–2 weeks (49.9%), 2–4 weeks (21.2%), and >1 month (0.8%). The greatest professional difficulties of Czech dentists during the pandemic were crisis operating management (55%), health safety and hygiene concerns (21%), shortage of personal protective equipment (21%), and difficulty working with the protective equipment (15%). In addition, 47.3% of dentists also observed a declining interest in preventive dental care, and 16.9% of them observed worse oral care of patients. These results show that despite the lack of protective equipment, dental care was maintained throughout the pandemic. Additionally, the pandemic negatively affected the patients’ approach to dental care, indicating a deterioration in oral health as a possible delayed outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Schmidt, Jan; Waldova, Eliska; Balkova, Stepanka; Suchanek, Jakub; Smucler, Roman",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501710/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179121,451

The cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on two host proteins angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). There is currently no vaccine available and also no effective drug for the treatment of COVID-19. Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) as a novel gasotransmitter has been shown to protect against lung damage via its anti-inflammation, antioxidative stress, antiviral, prosurvival, and antiaging effects. In light of the research advances on H(2)S signaling in biology and medicine, this review proposed H(2)S as a potential defense against COVID-19. It is suggested that H(2)S may block SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells by interfering with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication by attenuating virus assembly/release, and protect SARS-CoV-2-induced lung damage by suppressing immune response and inflammation development. Preclinical studies and clinical trials with slow-releasing H(2)S donor(s) or the activators of endogenous H(2)S-generating enzymes should be considered as a preventative treatment or therapy for COVID-19.","Yang, Guangdong",Am J Physiol Cell Physiol,https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpcell.00187.2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32515982/,451

Metal ions participate in maturation of genomic RNA, activation and catalytic mechanisms, reverse transcription, initial integration process and protection of newly synthesized DNA, inhibition of proton translocation (M2 protein), minus- and plus-strand transfer, enhance nucleic acid annealing, activation of transcription, integration of viral DNA into specific sites and act as a chaperone of nucleic acid. Metal ions are also required for nucleocapsid protein-transactivation response (TAR)–RNA interactions. In certain situations more than one metal ion is required e.g. RNA cleavage by RNase H.

To achieve the low detection limit for the early stage where a small number of viruses are present in the sample, proper amplified signals from a sensor can make readable and reliable detection. In this work, a new model of fluorescent and electrochemical dual-mode detection system has been developed to detect virus, taking recombinant Chikungunya virus E1 protein (CHIK-VP) as an example. The hydrophobic quantum dots (QDs) embedded in the lipid bilayer of liposome and methylene blue (MB) encapsulated in the inner core of liposomes played a role of dual-signaling modulator. After CHIK-VP addition, the nanocomposites and APTES-coated Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles (Fe(3)O(4) NPs) were conjugated with antibodies to form a sandwich structure and separated from the medium magnetically. The nanoconjugates have been burst out by chloroform as surfactant, and both the QDs and MB are released from the liposome and were then monitored through changes in the fluorescence and electrochemical signals, respectively. These two fluorometric and electrochemical signals alteration quantified the CHIK-VP in the range of femtogram to nanogram per milliliter level with a LOD of 32 fg mL(−1), making this liposomal system a potential matrix in a virus detection platform.

METHODS: Thirty participants were enrolled from January 14 to February 12, 2018 after providing informed consent for being videotaped. Data were collected by recording their indoor daily lives for 2 hours, resulting in 4,732 HEC cases. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the HEC readings, 3 training sessions were conducted for the videotape readers. Rereading and verifying randomly selected data ensured the validity of intra- and inter-reader readings. RESULTS: The most frequent contact items were phones, papers, computer accessories, and furniture surfaces. The contact density (frequency-duration/min) was highest for category II (items occasionally shared by others, 56.8), followed in descending order by category I (items for individual use, 35.9), and category III (public use items, 3.4). Significant differences in contact density were found according to participants’ demographic characteristics. CONCLUSION: As mobile phones were the most frequent contact item, regular and strict mobile phone cleansing or disinfection strategies are needed, in addition to preventative measures taken for category II and III items. Avoiding sharing personal items with others, refraining from unnecessary HEC, and maintaining strict hand hygiene are recommended.","Oh, Hyang Soon; Ryu, Mikyung; Yang, Youngran",Osong Public Health Res Perspect,https://doi.org/10.24171/j.phrp.2021.0006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34102046/,451

To date, the lack of effective vaccines and drugs is the main problem preventing control of the global spread of PEDV. In this study, we produced PEDV virus-like particles (VLPs) composed of S, M, and E proteins with a baculovirus expression system and tested them via indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA)and Western blot analysis. Electron microscopy showed that the morphological structure of the PEDV VLPs was similar to that of the protovirus. Microneutralization assays and ELISpot analysis demonstrated that PEDV VLPs induced highly specific antibody responses and Th2-mediated humoral immunity. As a result, the PEDV VLPs displayed excellent immunogenicity in mice. Therefore, a VLP-based vaccine has the potential to prevent PEDV infection.","Wang, Cuiling; Yan, Feihu; Zheng, Xuexing; Wang, Hualei; Jin, Hongli; Wang, Chong; Zhao, Yongkun; Feng, Na; Wang, Tiecheng; Gao, Yuwei; Yang, Songtao; Xia, Xianzhu",Virus Genes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28357676/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11262-017-1450-2,451
637436,A pre- and during Pandemic Survey of Sars-Cov-2 Infection in Stray Colony and Shelter Cats from a High Endemic Area of Northern Italy,2021-04-03,"BACKGROUND: Self-reported symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic have been used to train artificial intelligence models to identify possible infection foci. To date, these models have only considered the culmination or peak of symptoms, which is not suitable for the early detection of infection. We aimed to estimate the probability of an individual being infected with SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of early self-reported symptoms to enable timely self-isolation and urgent testing. METHODS: In this large-scale, prospective, epidemiological surveillance study, we used prospective, observational, longitudinal, self-reported data from participants in the UK on 19 symptoms over 3 days after symptoms onset and COVID-19 PCR test results extracted from the COVID-19 Symptom Study mobile phone app. We divided the study population into a training set (those who reported symptoms between April 29, 2020, and Oct 15, 2020) and a test set (those who reported symptoms between Oct 16, 2020, and Nov 30, 2020), and used three models to analyse the self-reported symptoms: the UK's National Health Service (NHS) algorithm, logistic regression, and the hierarchical Gaussian process model we designed to account for several important variables (eg, specific COVID-19 symptoms, comorbidities, and clinical information). Model performance to predict COVID-19 positivity was compared in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in the test set. For the hierarchical Gaussian process model, we also evaluated the relevance of symptoms in the early detection of COVID-19 in population subgroups stratified according to occupation, sex, age, and body-mass index. FINDINGS: The training set comprised 182 991 participants and the test set comprised 15 049 participants. When trained on 3 days of self-reported symptoms, the hierarchical Gaussian process model had a higher prediction AUC (0·80 [95% CI 0·80–0·81]) than did the logistic regression model (0·74 [0·74–0·75]) and the NHS algorithm (0·67 [0·67–0·67]). AUCs for all models increased with the number of days of self-reported symptoms, but were still high for the hierarchical Gaussian process model at day 1 (0·73 [95% CI 0·73–0·74]) and day 2 (0·79 [0·78–0·79]). At day 3, the hierarchical Gaussian process model also had a significantly higher sensitivity, but a non-statistically lower specificity, than did the two other models. The hierarchical Gaussian process model also identified different sets of relevant features to detect COVID-19 between younger and older subgroups, and between health-care workers and non-health-care workers. When used during different pandemic periods, the model was robust to changes in populations. INTERPRETATION: Early detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection is feasible with our model. Such early detection is crucial to contain the spread of COVID-19 and efficiently allocate medical resources.

Having a vaccine is one of the promising solutions. However, vaccination hesitancy is becoming a recognized future challenge. This study aims to evaluate the current vaccine hesitancy in a segment of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) general public and its associated factors. Methods: This was an online cross-sectional survey that took place from the 14(th) to the 19(th) of September 2020 across the UAE. The questionnaire asked the participants about their willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine in the future. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between vaccination willingness and the participants' sociodemographic factors, experiences and beliefs regarding COVID-19, and previous influenza vaccine uptake. Results: There was a total of 2,705 participants; 72.5% were females, and 69.8% were Emirati nationals. A total of 1,627 (60.1%) participants were willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine in the future. There were statistically significant associations between the following factors and vaccine acceptance: male gender, non-Emiratis, younger age group, residents of Sharjah and the Northern Emirates, having lesser educational attainment, perceived increased personal or public risk of contracting the disease [aOR = 1.71, 95% CI (1.35–2.17), p < 0.0001; aOR = 1.84, 95% CI (1.44–2.36), p < 0.0001, respectively], and increased perception of serious outcome from the disease. Conversely, vaccine hesitancy was associated with unemployment, not receiving the influenza vaccine within the past 2 years [aOR = 0.36, 95% CI (0.30–0.44), p < 0.0001], not believing in the seriousness of the COVID-19 situation or the vaccine's ability to control the pandemic, and not believing that the public authorities are handling the pandemic adequately. Having contracted the disease or knowing someone who has did not show a statistically significant association with vaccine acceptance. Vaccine safety, side effects, and the belief that one needs to develop immunity naturally were the top reasons for vaccination hesitancy. Conclusion: Given the level of vaccine hesitancy in the study population, this needs to be evaluated in a more representative sample of the whole population. If confirmed, this would signify the need for coordinated local and international initiatives to combat vaccine misinformation and reassure the public regarding vaccine safety and efficacy.","Albahri, Abdulaziz Hussain; Alnaqbi, Shahad Ahmed; Alshaali, Asma Obaid; Alnaqbi, Shatha Ahmed; Shahdoor, Shaikha Mohammad",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.614499; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34381748/,451
639603,Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 associated with aircraft travel: a systematic review (Version 1),2021-06-05,"BACKGROUND: Within-household transmission of Covid-19 is responsible for a significant number of infections. Efforts to protect at risk communities are needed. This study explored the acceptability of offering accommodation to support self-isolation among at risk populations, to prevent transmission of Covid-19 within vulnerable households. METHODS: Mixed methods design structured in two phases. Phase 1: Survey of 545 individuals who had provided consent to be contacted about ongoing research projects into infection control. Phase 2: Semi-structured interviews with 19 participants from ethnic minority and low income communities. RESULTS: Many survey and interview participants viewed the provision of accommodation as important and necessary in certain contexts. Of the 110 survey respondents, 85 (77%) said that they were not able to isolate at home. Among this group, 24 (28%) said they would accept accommodation and 23 (27%) said that they would probably accept. Of those unable to isolate at home, and at high risk if they caught the virus (N = 36) or living with someone at high risk (N 18), 19 (35%) said that they would accept, and 12 (22%) said they would probably accept accommodation. Factors influencing uptake of accommodation included perceived 1) household vulnerability 2) virus exposure and 3) lack of isolation at home options. Barriers to accepting the accommodation offer included 1) able to isolate at home 2) wanting to be with family 3) caring responsibilities 4) mental wellbeing concerns 5) concerns about moving when ill and 6) infection control concerns. Participants raised issues that should be addressed before accommodation is offered, including questions regarding who should use temporary accommodation and when, and how infection control in temporary accommodation would be managed. CONCLUSION: The provision of accommodation to prevent within household transmission of Covid-19 is viewed as acceptable, feasible and necessary by some people who are concerned about infection transmission in the home and are unable to self-isolate or socially distance at home. Different households will have different requirements, e.g., those with caring responsibilities, and to overcome these challenges additional support may be needed for the provision of accommodation to be feasible to those who could benefit most.

640162,Environmentally-induced mdig is a major contributor to the severity of COVID-19 through fostering expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptor NRPs and glycan metabolism,2021-02-01,"In patients with critically ill COVID-19 pneumonia, lower airways are filled with plenty of highly viscous exudates or mucus, leading to airway occlusion. The estimation of airway opening pressures and effective mucus clearance are therefore two issues that clinicians are most concerned about during mechanical ventilation. In this study we retrospectively analyzed respiratory data from 24 critically ill patients with COVID-19 who received invasive mechanical ventilation and recruitment maneuver at Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, China. Among 24 patients, the mean inspiratory plateau pressure was 52.4 ± 4.4 cmH(2)O (mean ± [SD]). Particularly, the capnograms presented an upward slope during the expiratory plateau, indicting the existence of airway obstruction. A computational model of airway opening was subsequently introduced to investigate possible fluid dynamic mechanisms for the extraordinarily high inspiratory plateau pressures among these patients. Our simulation results showed that the predicted airway opening pressures could be as high as 40–50 cmH(2)O and the suction pressure could exceed 20 kPa as the surface tension and viscosity of secretion simulants markedly increased, likely causing the closures of the distal airways. We concluded that, in some critically ill patients with COVID-19, limiting plateau pressure to 30 cmH(2)O may not guarantee the opening of airways due to the presence of highly viscous lower airway secretions, not to mention spontaneous inspiratory efforts. Active airway humidification and effective expectorant drugs are therefore strongly recommended during airway management.","Chen, Zhenglong; Zhong, Ming; Jiang, Li; Chen, Nanshan; Tu, Shengjin; Wei, Yuan; Sang, Ling; Zheng, Xia; Zhang, Chunyuan; Tao, Jiale; Deng, Linhong; Song, Yuanlin",Ann Biomed Eng,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10439-020-02648-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33078367/,451
640239,Extraction-free COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) diagnosis by RT-PCR to increase capacity for national testing programmes during a pandemic,2020-04-08,"BACKGROUND: Speech and language therapists (SLTs) working with dysphagia have had to radically alter diagnostic and rehabilitation services during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) pandemic, hereafter referred to as coronavirus disease (COVID‐19). Given the aerosol‐generating procedures inherent in swallow assessment and interventions, these SLTs have also been particularly susceptible to virus exposure. AIMS: To investigate the psychological impact of COVID‐19 on SLTs working with adult dysphagia across the Republic of Ireland and to identify the personal and professional factors associated with depression, anxiety, stress and post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). To explore SLT perspectives regarding their experiences during the COVID‐19 pandemic. METHODS & PROCEDURES: A cross‐sectional 34‐item online survey was developed and piloted. The survey collected demographic details and professional factors and it incorporated the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale—21 (DASS‐21) and the Impact of Event Scale—Revised (IES‐R). The survey also sought SLT perspectives regarding their experiences during the pandemic. It was distributed to Irish SLT managers, the Irish Association of Speech and Language Therapists (IASLT) and the Irish Dysphagia Special Interest Group (SIG) for dissemination. OUTCOMES & RESULTS: A total of 94 SLTs working with adults with dysphagia across Ireland responded. In total, 60% of respondents screened positive for depression, anxiety, stress and/or PTSD. Based on the DASS‐21, 38% screened positive for depression (mean score = 8.0; SD = 6.3), 36% screened positive for anxiety (mean score = 6.5; SD = 6.0), and 49% screened positive for stress (mean score = 15.4; SD = 6.9). A total of 26% of respondents screened positive for PTSD (mean IES‐R total score = 22.6; SD = 16.0). Factors associated with depression, anxiety, stress and PTSD were young age (p = 0.002), limited clinical experience (p = 0.01) and not living with children (p = 0.02). A thematic analysis of SLT perspectives identified four main themes: ‘fear of COVID‐19 infection and transmission’, ‘uncertainty regarding policies and procedures’, ‘changes in SLT roles and responsibilities’ and ‘increased workload’. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS: This study highlights the psychological impact of COVID‐19 on SLTs working with adults with dysphagia in Ireland and identifies SLTs who are at risk of depression, anxiety, stress and PTSD during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Findings may assist employers to identify staff who require psychological support and long‐term follow‐up during this pandemic and any future health emergencies. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT: Depression, anxiety, stress and PTSD are prevalent among nurses and other healthcare professionals internationally as a result of the COVID‐19 pandemic and associated factors have been identified in previous research. Despite this, no research has been conducted to establish the psychological impact of the first surge of COVID‐19 on SLTs working with dysphagia in relation to depression, anxiety, stress and PTSD and the associated factors. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE: A total of 60% of SLTs working with adults with dysphagia in this survey presented with depression, anxiety, stress and/or PTSD. Associated personal and professional factors amongst respondents included young age, limited clinical experience and not living with children. The perspectives of SLTs on their experiences during the first surge of COVID‐19 are also explored. WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL OR ACTUAL CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WORK? The findings from this study may assist SLT managers to identify SLTs who are at a higher risk of depression, anxiety, stress and PTSD to ensure appropriate support can be provided.","Rouse, Rachel; Regan, Julie",Int J Lang Commun Disord,https://doi.org/10.1111/1460-6984.12654; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34331499/,451

Poor allocation of limited testing resources leads to misutilization of health system resources, which complementary rapid testing tools could ameliorate. OBJECTIVE: To prediction tool based on complete blood count components and patient sex could predict SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective case-control design for collection of data and a logistic regression prediction model was used. Participants were emergency department patients > 18 years old who had concurrent complete blood counts and SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. 33 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive and 357 negative patients at Stanford Health Care used for model training. Validation cohorts consisted of emergency department patients > 18 years old who had concurrent complete blood counts and SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing in Northern California (41 PCR positive, 495 PCR negative), Seattle, Washington (40 PCR positive, 306 PCR negative), Chicago, Illinois (245 PCR positive, 1015 PCR negative), and South Korea (9 PCR positive, 236 PCR negative). RESULTS: A decision support tool that utilizes components of complete blood count and patient sex for prediction of SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity demonstrated a C-statistic of 78%, an optimized sensitivity of 93%, and generalizability to other emergency department populations. By restricting PCR testing to predicted positive patients in a hypothetical scenario of 1000 patients requiring testing but testing resources limited to 60% of patients, this tool would allow a 33% increase in properly allocated resources.

However, a fast and sensitive analytical methodology is important to monitor RDV drug profile in human plasma for pharmacokinetics (PK) and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). In this study, we demonstrate an improved vortex-assisted salt-induced liquid-liquid microextraction (VA-SI-LLME) technique coupled with UHPLC-PDA and UHPLC-MS/MS for rapid determination of RDV in human plasma. This technique involves simple one-step protein precipitation with hydrochloric acid and subsequent extraction with acetonitrile for analysis. Under the optimal VA-SI-LLME conditions (500 μL of acetonitrile with 2.5 g ammonium sulfate under 2 min vortex extraction), method validation results indicated an excellent correlation coefficient of 0.9969 for UHPLC-PDA (monitored at 254 nm) and 0.9990 for UHPLC-MS/MS (monitored at electrospray ionization with + ion mode transitions of m/z 603.1→m/z 402.20 and m/z 603.1→ m/z 199.90). The detection and quantification limits were 1.5 and 5 ng/mL for UHPLC/PDA, and 0.3 and 1 ng/mL for UHPLC-MS/MS, respectively. The developed method showed excellent extraction recoveries between 90.79 to 116.74 % and 85.68 to 101.34 % with intraday and interday precision ≤ 9.59 for both methods.

A total of 50 eligible articles were included that contributed 51 estimates of prevalence in 92722 participants. The overall pooled prevalence of stigma across all populations was 34% [95% CI: 28−40%], including enacted stigma (36% [95% CI: 28−44%]) and perceived stigma (31% [95% CI: 22−40%]). The prevalence of stigma in patients, community population, and health care workers, was 38% [95% CI: 12− 65%], 36% [95% CI: 28−45%], and 30% [95% CI: 20−40%], respectively.

Although hygiene is necessary to slow or prevent deadly pandemics of infectious disease such as COVID-19, hygiene can have unwanted effects. In particular, some aspects of hygiene cause a loss of biodiversity from the human body, characterized by the almost complete removal of intestinal worms (helminths) and protists. Research spanning more than half a century documents that this loss of biodiversity results in an increased propensity for autoimmune disease, allergic disorders, probably neuropsychiatric problems, and adverse reactions to infectious agents. The differences in immune function between communities with and communities without helminths have become so pronounced that the reduced lethality of SARS-CoV-2 in low-income countries compared to high-income countries was predicted early in the COVID-19 pandemic. This prediction, based on the maladaptive immune responses observed in many cases of COVID-19 in high-income countries, is now supported by emerging data from low-income countries. Herein, hygiene is subdivided into components involving personal choice versus components instituted by community wide systems such as sewage treatment facilities and water treatment plants. The different effects of personal hygiene and systems hygiene are described, and appropriate measures to alleviate the adverse effects of hygiene without losing the benefits of hygiene are discussed. Finally, text boxes summarizing this information are provided to function as stand-alone, public-domain handouts with the goal of informing the public about hygiene and suggesting solutions for biomedical researchers and policy makers.","Parker, William; Sarafian, Joshua T; Broverman, Sherryl A; Laman, Jon D",Evol Med Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1093/emph/eoab006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33732461/,451
642223,Mers-CoV: From camels to humans,2016-04-30,"Background Non-pharmaceutical interventions remain a primary means of suppressing COVID-19 until vaccination coverage is sufficient to achieve herd immunity. We used anonymized smartphone mobility measures in seven Canadian provinces to quantify the mobility level needed to suppress COVID-19 (mobility threshold), and the difference relative to current mobility levels (mobility gap). Methods We conducted a longitudinal study of weekly COVID-19 incidence from March 15, 2020 to January 16, 2021, among provinces with 20 COVID-19 cases in at least 10 weeks. The outcome was weekly growth rate defined as the ratio of current cases compared to the previous week. We examined the effects of average time spent outside the home (non-residential mobility) in the prior three weeks using a lognormal regression model accounting for province, season, and mean temperature. We calculated the COVID-19 mobility threshold and gap. Results Across the 44-week study period, a total of 704,294 persons were infected with COVID-19. Non-residential mobility dropped rapidly in the spring and reached a median of 36% (IQR: 31,40) in April 2020. After adjustment, each 5% increase in non-residential mobility was associated with a 9% increase in the COVID-19 weekly growth rate (ratio=1.09, 95%CI: 1.07,1.12). The mobility gap increased through the fall months, which was associated with increasing case growth. Interpretation Mobility strongly and consistently predicts weekly case growth, and low levels of mobility are needed to control COVID-19 through winter 2021. Mobility measures from anonymized smartphone data can be used to guide the provincial and regional implementation and loosening of physical distancing measures.","Brown, K. A.; Soucy, J.-P.

A control real-time RT-PCR was undertaken on GAPDH mRNA (a human housekeeping gene) was carried out to standardise the non-homogeneous respiratory samples. The real-time RT-PCR method was one log more sensitive for the detection of RSV according to the endpoint dilution technique than the culture method or a conventional qualitative RT-PCR-hybridization-EIA. No cross-reactivity was observed with any of the viruses that could be found in the respiratory tract. RSV and GAPDH were quantified in nasal aspirates from 75 children hospitalised for acute respiratory tract disease: 31 (41.3%) were positive according to the immunofluorescence assay (IFA), 34 (45.3%) were culture-positive and 42 (56%) were positive according to our real-time RT-PCR method. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the real-time RT-PCR were 100, 90, 92, 100%, respectively. The samples found to be positive for RSV were classified according to the severity of the disease. The mean number of RSV RNA copies was higher in the severe disease group than in the non-severe group 4.05×10(7) vs 9.1×10(6) (P=0.055). However, the mean ratio of RSV RNA copies to GAPDH mRNA copies was 42.8 in the severe group, and 22.2 in non-severe group (P=NS).","Gueudin, M; Vabret, A; Petitjean, J; Gouarin, S; Brouard, J; Freymuth, F",J Virol Methods,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093403000429; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12668266/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093403000429,451

Methods: According to the official data released by the National Health Commission, the epidemic data of infected people from 0:00 on January 24, 2020 to 24:00 on February 23, 2020 were quantitatively analyzed through statistical analysis. We used EXCEL software to draw the overall epidemic trend chart and Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) to carry out descriptive statistical analysis of mortality and cure rate. We made qualitative analysis on the emergency measures implemented by national administrative departments and provincial governments to work on controlling and monitoring COVID-19 nationwide spread. Results: The number of patients diagnosed showed a linear increasing trend, with the slope increasing first and decreasing later. Suspected and new cases showed an inverted V pattern, with the peak occurring on February 8 and 12, respectively. There was a linear increase in the number of deaths and an exponential increase in the number of cures. Over the 31-day study period, the mortality rate fluctuated between 2.0% and 3.4%. The mean cure rate was 10.03%, the minimum value was 1.33%, and the maximum value was 32.05%. The quantitative and qualitative analysis shows that the public health emergency response system constructed in China plays a significant role in controlling the epidemic in a certain period of time. Discussion: The four-tier emergency management system and the joint prevention mechanism established in China have provided various resources to control the epidemic, but there are still weakness in dealing with the spread of COVID-19. It is suggested to improve and strengthen the emergency management system, public health service system, health legal system, citizen health education, and international exchange and cooperation.","Xu, Tingting; Yang, Ruoyu",J Epidemiol Glob Health,https://doi.org/10.2991/jegh.k.200421.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32538026/,451
643352,ER Stress-Induced Secretion of Proteins and Their Extracellular Functions in the Heart,2020-09-10,"INTRODUCTION: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, research in virtual care for young people with eating disorders was preliminary and implementation rare. This study explored the experience of young people, parents and clinicians when therapy was transitioned to virtual provision as a result of the UK lockdown in March 2020. METHODS: A mixed-method approach was used in this study. Online questionnaires that included a mixture of rating (Likert scale) and free-text response questions were completed by 53 young people with any eating disorder, 75 parents and 23 clinicians. Questions focused on the experience of online treatment as well as the impact on engagement, perceived treatment efficacy and preferences around treatment mode in the future. Likert scale questions were analysed using a summary approach. Free-text responses were analysed qualitatively using reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Responses to rating scale questions indicate satisfaction with treatment, good engagement and ability to manage technology. Young people who had transitioned care, rather than started care virtually in lockdown, rated therapy as less effective. However, individual accounts of experience were more varied. Reflexive thematic analysis of free-text responses identified key themes of 1) Making it work, 2) Home as a therapeutic space, and 3) Disrupted connection and 4) Into the future. CONCLUSIONS: These results have implications for ongoing care during the pandemic and for future implementation of virtual care in the treatment of young people with eating disorders. Particular issues arising are the trade-off between accessibility and therapeutic engagement and depth and need for consideration of equal access to treatment in socially unequal societies.

Immunocompromised patients could have a more severe COVID‐19 disease, due to the absence of an adequate immune response against the SARS‐CoV‐2. However, therapies that act on immune response could play a protective role by dampening the cytokine release syndrome. Fingolimod is a drug used for immune therapy in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) through the sequestration of activated lymphocytes in the lymph nodes. We report the case of a 57‐year‐old man with relapsing‐remitting MS treated with fingolimod that showed a reactivation of COVID‐19 with signs of hyperinflammation syndrome after fingolimod withdrawal. Our case suggests that discontinuation of fingolimod during COVID‐19 could imply a worsening of SARS‐CoV2 infection. This article is protected by copyright.

644293,Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in Multiple Sclerosis: The Hidden Part of the Iceberg,2020-12-16,"PURPOSE: External radiotherapy process is a chain of steps in which each of them is carried out only if the previous one has been completed. The development of hypofractionation practices in recent years tends to increase the workload of the stages of preparation for irradiation and to decrease the number of fractions per patient. The purpose of this retrospective study is to analyze the evolution of these practices in a single centre and to assess the organizational issues involved. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All radiation therapy records management data were extracted from the Radiation Therapy Information System. Radiotherapy sessions were identified by patient and by ICD (International Classification of Diseases) code. The filling rate of the treatment equipment was calculated using actual data from the radiotherapy department. RESULTS: From 2015 to 2019, there was an increase in the number of scans (+16%), the number of patients treated (+11.6%) and the volume of hours available for treatment (+12%). Also, there was a decrease in the total number of fractions (−5%), in the average number of fractions performed per treatment sequence (−19%), in the occupancy rate of the machines (−7%) and in the average number of fractions performed per patient treated for malignant tumours of the bronchi and lung (−38%), digestive organs (−37%), secondary (−19%) breast (−15%) and prostate (−15%). The number of fractions administered per treatment sequence between 2015 and 2019 decreased significantly for patients in age groups [20–69] (P < 0.001) and [> 70] (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: A paradox appears between the increase in the total number of patients treated and the decrease in the loading rate of linacs. This shift of workload has an impact on the quality and safety of care and on the organizational and investment strategies. It also has an economic impact where the model of reimbursement is based on per fraction pricing. A reorganization of radiotherapy services is inevitable.","Corbin, S.; Brusadin, G.; Rivera, S.; Bossi, A.; Deutsch, É.",Cancer Radiother,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1278321820301797; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1278321820301797,451

This study aimed to examine COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among U.S. adults with a history of using tobacco products or marijuana. Data were collected online in 2020–2021 including respondents’ willingness to accept a COVID-19 vaccine, factors that may promote vaccine acceptance, and prior history of influenza vaccination. Logistic regression models were conducted to estimate the associations between vaccine hesitancy and demographic characteristics, substance use, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and prior influenza vaccination. Among 387 respondents, 49.1% were willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, 26.0% were unwilling, and 24.9% were “not sure.” Blacks, suburban or rural residents, those who lived by themselves or with a family with five members or above, those who were not stressed because of the COVID-19 pandemic were more likely to say “no” to a COVID-19 vaccine. Respondents who never, only once, or during some years received an influenza vaccine were 7.0, 6.2, and 5.2 times more likely to say “no” to a COVID-19 vaccine than respondents who received an influenza vaccination every year or almost every year. The use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and marijuana, as well as heavy drinking of alcohol, were not associated with COVID-19 hesitancy. The associations between demographic factors and vaccine hesitancy were roughly similar for COVID-19 and influenza vaccines. Although various demographic groups have different levels of vaccine hesitancy and also have different factors to increase their acceptance, addressing misinformation related to COVID-19 vaccines, particularly concern about the safety of the vaccines is crucial in general.","Yang, Yong; Dobalian, Aram; Ward, Kenneth D.",J Community Health,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10900-021-00993-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33956270/,451

Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA), a multidisciplinary process that is considered the gold standard of care for older adults, does not routinely include podiatry assessment and intervention in hospitalized older adults. AIMS: To introduce foot assessment to inpatient CGA to determine prevalence of foot disease, foot disease risk factors and inappropriate footwear use, assess inter-rater reliability of foot assessments, determine current podiatry input and examine associations between patient characteristics and foot disease risks. METHODS: Prospective, observational cohort study of older adults on geriatric rehabilitation wards. Foot assessment completed using the Queensland Foot Disease Form (QFDF) in addition to routine CGA. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients (median age [inter-quartile range] 86.4 [79.2–90.3] years, 54% female) were included. Six patients (12%) had foot disease and 13 (25%) had a ‘high risk’ or ‘at risk’ foot. Foot disease risk factor prevalence was peripheral arterial disease 9 (17%); neuropathy 10 (19%) and foot deformity 11 (22%). Forty-one patients (85%) wore inappropriate footwear. Inter-rater agreement was substantial on presence of foot disease and arterial disease, fair to moderate on foot deformity and fair on neuropathy and inappropriate footwear. Eight patients (15%) saw a podiatrist during admission: 5 with foot disease, 1 ‘at risk’ and 2 ‘low risk’ for foot disease. Patients with an at risk foot or foot disease had significantly longer median length of hospital stay (25 [13.7–32.1] vs 15.2 [8–22.1] days, p = 0.01) and higher median Malnutrition Screening Test scores (2 [0–3] vs 0 [0–2], p = 0.03) than the low-risk group. Patients with foot disease were most likely to see a podiatrist (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Foot disease, foot disease risk factors and inappropriate footwear are common in hospitalized older adults, however podiatry assessment and intervention is mostly limited to patients with foot disease. Addition of routine podiatry assessment to the multidisciplinary CGA team should be considered. Examination for arterial disease and risk of malnutrition may be useful to identify at risk patients for podiatry review.

The gradual dumping of plastic wastes, inadequate standard detection methods with specific removal techniques, and slow disposal rate of microplastics make it ubiquitous in the environment. Evidence shows that microplastics act as a potential vector by adsorbing different heavy metals, pathogens, and other chemical additives widely used in different raw plastic production. Microplastics are ingested by aquatic creatures such as fish and different crustaceans, and finally, people ingest them at the tertiary level of the food chain. This phenomenon is responsible for blocking the digestion tracts, disturbing the digestive behavior, finally decreasing the reproductive growth of entire living organisms. Because of these consequences, microplastics have become an increasing concern as a newly emerging potential threat, and therefore, the control of microplastics in aquatic media is required. This paper provides a critical analysis of existing and newly developed methods for detecting and separating microplastics from discharged wastewater, which are the ultimate challenges in the microplastic treatment systems. A critical study on the effect of microplastics on aquatic organisms and human health is also discussed. Thus, this analysis provides a complete understanding of entire strategies for detecting and removing microplastics and their associated issues to ensure a waste discharge standard to minimize the ultimate potential impact in aquatic environments.

We aimed to 1) determine the frequency of patients who wished to be DNR prior to cardiac arrest; 2) determine what proportion received CPR; and 3) explain why DNR patients received CPR. METHODS: This was a retrospective chart review study of cardiac arrest patients at an emergency department. We reported the frequency and proportion of patients who 1) had valid DNR orders presented at the time of cardiac arrest; 2) had valid DNR orders that were unavailable at the time of arrest 3) had Advanced Directives but no DNR orders; 4) had their DNR orders rescinded; and 5) wished to be DNR but did not have any documents in place. RESULTS: Of 419 patients, 65 (15.51%) wished to be DNR. Out of these 65 patients, 38 (58.46 %) patients were resuscitated. Among the 38 patients, 23 (60.52%) received CPR accordingly and 15 (39.47%) patients were inappropriately resuscitated. CONCLUSION: In our sample of 419 patients, 65 (15.51%) did not want CPR in the event of cardiac arrest and 38 (9.06%) received CPR against their wishes.

All participants were self-reported asymptomatic for at least three days at the time of testing. Results: Two hundred eighty-five samples were collected from March 24, 2020 to April 4, 2020. The average age of participants was 38 years (range 18-84), and 54% were male. Thirty-three percept tested IgG positive, 3% tested weakly positive, and 64% tested negative. Neither age nor sex was associated with antibody development. Conclusion: Thirty-six percent of HCW had IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, reflecting the high exposure of inpatient and ambulatory frontline staff to this viral illness, most of whom had minimal symptoms and were working in the weeks preceding testing. While we continue to recommend standard protective precautions per CDC guidelines for all HCW, HCW with SARS-CoV-2 IgG may become our safest frontline providers as we learn if our IgG antibodies confer immunity. Knowing IgG antibody status may ease concerns regarding personal risk as this pandemic continues.","Mansour, M.; Levin, E.; Muellers, K.; Stone, K.; Mendu, R.; Wajnberg, A.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.27.20090811; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.27.20090811v1?rss=1,451

Family carers are faced with making significant and emotive decisions during the pandemic, including decisions about end of life. We aimed to explore the challenges faced by family carers of people living with dementia during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in England, as reported by charity telephone support line staff, who were able to objectively discuss a range of different experiences of many different carers who call the helpline. In particular, we focussed on key concerns and areas of decision making at the end of life. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with eight telephone support line staff from two UK based charities who support carers of people living with dementia and those at the end of life. Interviews were conducted in the first wave of the pandemic in England in May–June 2020. RESULTS: An overarching theme of uncertainty and reactivity during a crisis was identified, and within this, five main themes were identified: concerns about care transitions, uncertainty in engaging support and help, pandemic-motivated care planning, maintaining the wellbeing of the person living with dementia, and trust, loss of agency and confusion. CONCLUSIONS: Family carers may be reluctant to seek support because of fear of what may happen to their relative, which may include hospitalisation and becoming ill with COVID-19, care home placement, or not being able to be with a relative at the end of life. In some cases, a lack of trust has developed, and instead carers are seeking support from alternative services they trust such as nationally known charities.This study was used to inform the development of a decision aid to support family carers making decisions about care for their relative with dementia during the pandemic, who the lack the capacity to make their own decisions.","Aker, Narin; West, Emily; Davies, Nathan; Moore, Kirsten J.; Sampson, Elizabeth L.; Nair, Pushpa; Kupeli, Nuriye",BMC Health Serv Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34548067/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-07019-6,451

To estimate the number of infected persons in our community, we conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: This cross-sectional study evaluated the presence of immunoglobulin G, antibody for SARS-CoV-2 during the time period of July 15, 2020, to July 27, 2020. Testing was done on serum samples from patients who had visited affiliated outpatient clinics or our emergency department. Additionally, we collected age, gender, ethnicity, race, and location of testing. RESULTS: Eight hundred sixty-five tests were included in the study. The outpatient clinics cohort accounted for 56% of results and emergency department (ED) contributed 44%. The positive percentage of SARS-CoV-2 test was 9.4% (95% CI: 0.08–0.12). The positivity rates of the outpatient (5.6%) and ED (14.2%) setting differed. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG was greatest in those that identified as Hispanic/Latino, 18.1% versus 13.4% in other groups. Specifically compared to the non-Hispanic/Latino population, the prevalence was significantly higher, with a relative risk of 2.73 (95% CI: 1.8–4.1), p < 0.0001. CONCLUSION: The low antibody positivity rate in the community indicates the need for a vaccine. The Hispanic/Latino patient population should be considered for increased education on preventing transmission and acquisition of COVID-19 as well as being considered as a priority for vaccination once a vaccine is available.","Yamaki, Jason; Peled, Harry; Mathews, Sajen; Park, David; Firoozi, Mina; Smith, Kim; Nguyen, Lee",J Racial Ethn Health Disparities,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33230735/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-020-00918-0,451

A preliminary report of an open-label phase 1 clinical trial",2021-03-03,"West Nile virus (WNV) is a human pathogen of significant medical importance with close to 40,000 cases of encephalitis and more than 1,600 deaths reported in the US alone since its first emergence in New York in 1999. Previous studies identified a motif in the beginning of non-structural gene NS2A of encephalitic flaviviruses including WNV which induces programmed −1 ribosomal frameshift (PRF) resulting in production of an additional NS protein NS1′. We have previously demonstrated that mutant WNV with abolished PRF was attenuated in mice. Here we have extended our previous observations by showing that PRF does not appear to have a significant role in virus replication, virion formation, and viral spread in several cell lines in vitro. However, we have also shown that PRF induces an over production of structural proteins over non-structural proteins in virus-infected cells and that mutation abolishing PRF is present in ∼11% of the wild type virus population. In vivo experiments in house sparrows using wild type and PRF mutant of New York 99 strain of WNV viruses showed some attenuation for the PRF mutant virus. Moreover, PRF mutant of Kunjin strain of WNV showed significant decrease compared to wild type virus infection in dissemination of the virus from the midgut through the haemocoel, and ultimately the capacity of infected mosquitoes to transmit virus. Thus our results demonstrate an important role for PRF in regulating expression of viral genes and consequently virus replication in avian and mosquito hosts.","Melian, Ezequiel Balmori; Hall-Mendelin, Sonja; Du, Fangyao; Owens, Nick; Bosco-Lauth, Angela M.; Nagasaki, Tomoko; Rudd, Stephen; Brault, Aaron C.; Bowen, Richard A.; Hall, Roy A.; van den Hurk, Andrew F.; Khromykh, Alexander A.",PLoS Pathog,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004447; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25375107/,451
652210,Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in a patient vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2.,2021-09-04,"In this longitudinal cohort study, we assessed the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seroconversion rates and analyzed the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine-induced immunity of 872 hospital workers at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf between May 11 and May 31, 2021. The overall seroprevalence of anti–NC–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 4.7% (n = 41), indicating low SARS-CoV-2 infection rates and persistent effectiveness of hospital-wide infection control interventions during the second and third wave of the pandemic. In total, 92.7% (n = 808) out of the entire study cohort, 98.2% (n = 325) of those who had been vaccinated once and all 393 individuals who had been vaccinated twice had detectable anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and no significant differences in vaccine-induced immune response were detected between male and female individuals and between different age groups. Vaccinated study participants with detectable anti–NC–SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers (n = 30) developed generally higher anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers compared to anti–NC–SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals (n = 694) (median titer: 7812 vs. 345 BAU/ml, p < 0.0001). Furthermore, study participants who received heterologous vaccination with AZD1222 followed by an mRNA vaccine showed markedly higher anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers than individuals who received two doses of an mRNA vaccine or two doses of AZD1222 (median titer: AZD1222/AZD1222: 1069 BAU/ml, mRNA/mRNA: 1388 BAU/ml, AZD1222/mRNA: 9450 BAU/ml; p < 0.0001).

Since no specific therapy is currently available for the same, the present study was aimed to explore the SARS‐CoV‐2 genome for the identification of immunogenic regions using immunoinformatics approach. A series of computational tools were applied in a systematic way to identify the epitopes that could be utilized in vaccine development. The screened‐out epitopes were passed through several immune filters, such as promiscuousity, conservancy, antigenicity, nonallergenicity, population coverage, nonhomologous to human proteins, and affinity with human leukocyte antigen alleles, to screen out the best possible ones. Further, a construct comprising 11 CD4, 12 CD8, 3 B cell, and 3 interferon‐γ epitopes, along with an adjuvant β‐defensin, was designed in silico, resulting in the formation of a multiepitope vaccine. The in silico immune simulation and population coverage analysis of the vaccine sequence showed its capacity to elicit cellular, humoral, and innate immune cells and to cover up a worldwide population of more than 97%. Further, the interaction analysis of the vaccine construct with Toll‐like receptor 3 (immune receptor) was carried out by docking and dynamics simulations, revealing high affinity, constancy, and pliability between the two. The overall findings suggest that the vaccine may be highly effective, and is therefore required to be tested in the lab settings to evaluate its efficacy.","Chauhan, Varun; Rungta, Tripti; Rawat, Manmeet; Goyal, Kapil; Gupta, Yash; Singh, Mini P.",J Cell Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32643158/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.29923,451

Although the pathways by which social participation, as a dimension of social capital, may have a positive effect on health seem clearly identified, empirical evidence is mixed because the lack of longitudinal data makes it difficult to deal with individual heterogeneity. Our study investigates the relationship between social participation (as measured by being a member, active, or both a member and active) in associations and self-rated health in a panel setting, using the first five waves of the British Household Panel Survey from 1991 to 1995 (unbalanced panel N = 45,745).

These include two mutations in the N terminal domain (NTD) of the S protein, HV69-70del and Y144del (also known as Y145del due to the presence of tyrosine at both positions). We recently identified several emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concerns, characterized by Membrane (M) protein mutations, including I82T and V70L. We now identify a sub-lineage of B.1.1.7 that emerged through sequential acquisitions of M:V70L in November 2020 followed by a novel S:D178H mutation first observed in early February 2021. The percentage of B.1.1.7 isolates in the U.S. that belong to this sub-lineage increased from 0.15% in February 2021 to 1.8% in April 2021. To date this sub-lineage appears to be U.S.-specific with reported cases in 31 states, including Hawaii. As of April 2021 it constituted 36.8% of all B.1.1.7 isolates in Washington. Phylogenetic analysis and transmission inference with Nextstrain suggests this sub-lineage likely originated in either California or Washington. Structural analysis revealed that the S:D178H mutation is in the NTD of the S protein and close to two other signature mutations of B.1.1.7, HV69-70del and Y144del. It is surface exposed and may alter NTD tertiary configuration or accessibility, and thus has the potential to affect neutralization by NTD directed antibodies.","Shen, L.; Dien Bard, J.; Triche, T.

Those at high risk for infection and serious complications are especially advised to be vaccinated to protect themselves. Using influenza as a model, we studied one method of increasing vaccine uptake: informing high-risk patients, identified by a machine learning model, about their risk status. Patients (N=39,717) were evenly randomized to (1) a control condition (exposure only to standard direct mail or patient portal vaccine promotion efforts) or to be told via direct mail, patient portal, and/or SMS that they were (2) at high risk for influenza and its complications if not vaccinated; (3) at high risk according to a review of their medical records; or (4) at high risk according to a computer algorithm analysis of their medical records. Patients in the three treatment conditions were 5.7% more likely to get vaccinated during the 112 days post-intervention (p < .001), and did so 1.4 days earlier (p < .001), on average, than those in the control group. There were no significant differences among risk messages, suggesting that patients are neither especially averse to nor uniquely appreciative of learning their records had been reviewed or that computer algorithms were involved.

The causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, is a member of the Coronaviridae family, which are viruses that cause respiratory infections of varying severity. The cellular host factors and pathways co-opted by SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses in the execution of their life cycles remain ill-defined. To develop an extensive compendium of host factors required for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and three seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E), we performed parallel genome-scale CRISPR knockout screens. These screens uncovered multiple host factors and pathways with pan-coronavirus and virus-specific functional roles, including major dependency on glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, SREBP signaling, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis, as well as an unexpected requirement for several poorly characterized proteins. We identified an absolute requirement for the VTT-domain containing protein TMEM41B for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and all other coronaviruses.

These similarities include hijacking signaling mechanisms that induce metabolic rewiring in the host to up-regulate nucleotide metabolism and, in parallel, suppress the immune response. In both cancer and viral infections, the host immune cells and, specifically, lymphocytes augment nucleotide synthesis to support their own proliferation and effector functions. Consequently, established treatment modalities targeting nucleotide metabolism against cancers and virally infected cells may result in restricted immune response. Encouragingly, following the introduction of immunotherapy against cancers, multiple studies improved our understanding for improving antigen presentation to the immune system. We propose here that understanding the immune consequences of targeting nucleotide metabolism against cancers may be harnessed to optimize therapy against viral infections.","Ariav, Yarden; Ch’ng, James H; Christofk, Heather R.; Ron-Harel, Noga; Erez, Ayelet",Sci Adv,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abg6165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34138729/,451

However, SARS-CoV-2 prevalence among HCWs is not known in Zambia. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional SARS-CoV-2 prevalence survey among Zambian HCWs in twenty health facilities in six districts in July 2020. Participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for health facility clustering, were calculated for each test separately and a combined measure for those who had PCR and ELISA performed. RESULTS: In total, 660 HCWs participated in the study, with 450 (68.2%) providing nasopharyngeal swab for PCR and 575 (87.1%) providing a blood specimen for ELISA. Sixty-six percent of participants were females and the median age was 31.5 years (interquartile range 26.2–39.8 years). The overall prevalence of the combined measure was 9.3% (95% CI 3.8%–14.7%). PCR-positive prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.6% (95% CI 2.0%–11.1%) and ELISA-positive prevalence was 2.2% (95% CI 0.5%–3.9%). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 prevalence among HCWs was similar to a population-based estimate (10.6%) during a period of community transmission in Zambia. Public health measures such as establishing COVID-19 treatment centers before the first cases, screening for COVID-19 symptoms among patients accessing health facilities, infection prevention and control trainings, and targeted distribution of personal protective equipment based on exposure risk might have prevented increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission among Zambian HCWs.","Fwoloshi, Sombo; Hines, Jonas Z; Barradas, Danielle T; Yingst, Samuel; Siwingwa, Mpanji; Chirwa, Lameck; Zulu, James E; Banda, Dabwitso; Wolkon, Adam; Nikoi, Kotey I; Chirwa, Bob; Kampamba, Davies; Shibemba, Aaron; Sivile, Suilanji; Zyambo, Khozya D; Chanda, Duncan; Mupeta, Francis; Kapina, Muzala; Sinyange, Nyambe; Kapata, Nathan; Zulu, Paul M; Makupe, Alex; Mweemba, Aggrey; Mbewe, Nyuma; Ziko, Luunga; Mukonka, Victor; Mulenga, Lloyd B; Malama, Kennedy; Agolory, Simon",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33784382/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab273,451

Virtually, all members of school communities have been impacted and the long-term ramifications of the pandemic remain unknown. However, despite being a novel virus, crisis management practices for other crisis (e.g., natural disasters, technological disasters, unexpected deaths) have utility for school safety promotion and helping affected individuals cope effectively with the monumental challenges they face during the pandemic. Such practices can reduce risk while fostering resilience concomitantly. This special issue, Perspectives on COVID-19: Addressing Diverse Needs of Children, Youth, Families, Educators, and Human Service Professionals, includes a diverse collection of conceptual, quantitative, and qualitative articles addressing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on youth and their families, educators, allied human services professionals, and the systems in which they work. Consistent with a crisis management and risk and resilience perspectives, articles emphasize youth most vulnerable to the impact of COVID-19, including youth with disabilities, from minoritized backgrounds, and within underserved populations. Articles also have implications for coping, resilience, and intervention and focus on how service delivery can best meet the needs of those impacted by acute and chronic crisis events. The research and scholarship included in this special issue represents an important step forward with providing school psychologists and related professions with cutting-edge information that can help enhance their practice during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

Therefore, in the present study, 1528 anti-HIV1compounds were screened by sequence alignment between 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2 and avian infectious bronchitis virus (avian coronavirus) followed by machine learning predictive model, drug-likeness screening and molecular docking, which resulted in 41 screened compounds. These 41 compounds were re-screened by deep learning model constructed considering the IC(50) values of known inhibitors which resulted in 22 hit compounds. Further, screening was done by structural activity relationship mapping which resulted in two structural clefts. Thereafter, functional group analysis was also done, where cluster 2 showed the presence of several essential functional groups having pharmacological importance. In the final stage, Cluster 2 compounds were re-docked with four different PDB structures of 3CLpro, and their depth interaction profile was analyzed followed by molecular dynamics simulation at 100 ns. Conclusively, 2 out of 1528 compounds were screened as potential hits against 3CLpro which could be further treated as an excellent drug against SARS-CoV-2.","Nand, Mahesha; Maiti, Priyanka; Joshi, Tushar; Chandra, Subhash; Pande, Veena; Kuniyal, Jagdish Chandra; Ramakrishnan, Muthannan Andavar",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33230180/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-77524-x,451

Majority of the countries are relying on models and studies such as stochastic simulations, AceMod model, neural networks-based models, exponential growth model,Weibull distribution model, and so on to forecast the number of COVID-19 cases in the coming months. The objective on utilizing these models is to ensure that strict measures can be enacted to contain the virus spread and also predict the resources required to deal with the pandemic as the disease spreads. In the past few months, several models were used to predict the infection rate for COVID-19. These models predicted the infection rates, recovery rate or death rates for the COVID-19 patients. All these different models took different approaches and different scenarios to predict the future rates. Now, that we know the real cases, we can check how accurate these models were. Some of these models were able to predict the near future quite close to the reality but most of them went astray. In this study, we review major forecasting models that were used in the context of India during country-wise lockdown and compare them. From these comparisons, we can see that while the advanced warning can be helpful in mitigating and preparing for an impending or ongoing epidemic, effects can be catastrophic if poorly fitting models are used for predictions.","Gola, Abhinav; Arya, Ravi Kumar; Animesh, Animesh; Dugh, Ravi",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.03.20167254; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.03.20167254v1?rss=1,451

Patients on kidney replacement therapy comprise a vulnerable population and may be at increased risk of death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently, only limited data are available on outcomes in this patient population. Methods. We set up the ERACODA (European Renal Association COVID-19 Database) database, which is specifically designed to prospectively collect detailed data on kidney transplant and dialysis patients with COVID-19. For this analysis, patients were included who presented between 1 February and 1 May 2020 and had complete information available on the primary outcome parameter, 28-day mortality. Results. Of the 1073 patients enrolled, 305 (28%) were kidney transplant and 768 (72%) dialysis patients with a mean age of 60 ± 13 and 67 ± 14 years, respectively. The 28-day probability of death was 21.3% [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 14.3–30.2%] in kidney transplant and 25.0% (95% CI 20.2–30.0%) in dialysis patients. Mortality was primarily associated with advanced age in kidney transplant patients, and with age and frailty in dialysis patients. After adjusting for sex, age and frailty, in-hospital mortality did not significantly differ between transplant and dialysis patients [hazard ratio (HR) 0.81, 95% CI 0.59–1.10, P = 0.18]. In the subset of dialysis patients who were a candidate for transplantation (n = 148), 8 patients died within 28 days, as compared with 7 deaths in 23 patients who underwent a kidney transplantation <1 year before presentation (HR adjusted for sex, age and frailty 0.20, 95% CI 0.07–0.56, P < 0.01). Conclusions. The 28-day case-fatality rate is high in patients on kidney replacement therapy with COVID-19 and is primarily driven by the risk factors age and frailty. Furthermore, in the first year after kidney transplantation, patients may be at increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality as compared with dialysis patients on the waiting list for transplantation. This information is important in guiding clinical decision-making, and for informing the public and healthcare authorities on the COVID-19-related mortality risk in kidney transplant and dialysis patients.","Hilbrands, Luuk B; Duivenvoorden, Raphaël; Vart, Priya; Franssen, Casper F M; Hemmelder, Marc H; Jager, Kitty J; Kieneker, Lyanne M; Noordzij, Marlies; Pena, Michelle J; de Vries, Hanne; Arroyo, David; Covic, Adrian; Crespo, Marta; Goffin, Eric; Islam, Mahmud; Massy, Ziad A; Montero, Nuria; Oliveira, João P; Roca Muñoz, Ana; Sanchez, J Emilio; Sridharan, Sivakumar; Winzeler, Rebecca; Gansevoort, Ron T",Nephrol Dial Transplant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33151337/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfaa261,451

Nevertheless, the means by which random mutation improves viral fitness is not well characterized. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the human coronavirus, HCoV-229E, in complex with the ectodomain of its receptor, aminopeptidase N (APN). Three extended loops are solely responsible for receptor binding and the evolution of HCoV-229E and its close relatives is accompanied by changing loop–receptor interactions. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the natural HCoV-229E receptor-binding loop variation observed defines six RBD classes whose viruses have successively replaced each other in the human population over the past 50 years. These RBD classes differ in their affinity for APN and their ability to bind an HCoV-229E neutralizing antibody. Together, our results provide a model for alphacoronavirus adaptation and evolution based on the use of extended loops for receptor binding.","Wong, Alan H. M.; Tomlinson, Aidan C.

Linking host and virus genome sequence information to antibody response and biological information may identify patient or viral characteristics associated with poor and favourable outcomes. This study aims to (1) identify characteristics of the antibody response that result in maintained immune response and better outcomes, (2) determine the impact of genetic differences on infection severity and immune response, (3) determine the impact of viral lineage on antibody response and patient outcomes and (4) evaluate patient-reported outcomes of receiving host genome, antibody and viral lineage results. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A prospective, observational cohort study is being conducted among adult patients with COVID-19 in the Greater Toronto Area. Blood samples are collected at baseline (during infection) and 1, 6 and 12 months after diagnosis. Serial antibody titres, isotype, antigen target and viral neutralisation will be assessed. Clinical data will be collected from chart reviews and patient surveys. Host genomes and T-cell and B-cell receptors will be sequenced. Viral genomes will be sequenced to identify viral lineage. Regression models will be used to test associations between antibody response, physiological response, genetic markers and patient outcomes. Pathogenic genomic variants related to disease severity, or negative outcomes will be identified and genome wide association will be conducted. Immune repertoire diversity during infection will be correlated with severity of COVID-19 symptoms and human leucocyte antigen-type associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants can learn their genome sequencing, antibody and viral sequencing results; patient-reported outcomes of receiving this information will be assessed through surveys and qualitative interviews. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by Clinical Trials Ontario Streamlined Ethics Review System (CTO Project ID: 3302) and the research ethics boards at participating hospitals.

The cellular A(570) values, the highest virus inhibitory rates and the score based on virus inhibitory rate were calculated to compare their antiviral activity. In immune protective test, the effects of three preparations (EF-BSRF, EF-SF-WDFF-BSRF and EF-WDFF-BSRF screened by the results in vitro experiment) on NDV infection were compared in chickens vaccinated with ND vaccine then challenged with NDV. Blood was regularly sampled for serum antibody titer determination. The pathogenic and dead statuses of chickens were clinically examined. The results indicated that the A(570) values of the nine prescriptions, especially the foresaid three prescriptions at almost all concentrations in three drug-adding modes were significantly higher than that of the virus control group. The foresaid three prescriptions presented at the top five of the highest virus inhibitory rate, and located at the highest three of the score rank. The antibody titers and protective rates of the three prescriptions groups were higher than that of VC group, especially EF-SF-WDFF-BSRF group showed significant difference. These results indicated that flavone prescriptions composed with suitable compatibility could possess synergistical action of antiviral effect, ES-SF-WDFF-BSRF prescription could inhibit the cellular infectivity of NDV, improve the protective effect of ND vaccine and would be expected to exploit into a new-type antiviral drug.","Yuqing, Zhang; Zhan’ao, Sun; Jiaguo, Liu; Deyun, Wang; Baokang, Zhang; Fang, Yi; Yunpeng, Fan; Dan, Liu; Xu, Liu; Cui, Liu; Yuanliang, Hu",Int J Biol Macromol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22575392/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2012.04.028; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141813012001596; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0141813012001596,451

659059,Viral load of SARS-CoV-2 across patients and compared to other respiratory viruses,2020-07-16,"The beta-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is at the origin of a persistent worldwide pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 infections initiate in the bronchi of the upper respiratory tract and are able to disseminate to the lower respiratory tract eventually causing acute severe respiratory syndrome with a high degree of mortality in the elderly. Here we use reconstituted primary bronchial epithelia from adult and children donors to follow the infection dynamic following infection with SARS-CoV-2. We show that in bronchial epithelia derived from adult donors, infections initiate in multi-ciliated cells. Then, infection rapidly spread within 24-48h throughout the whole epithelia. Within 3-4 days, large apical syncytia form between multi-ciliated cells and basal cells, which dissipate into the apical lumen. We show that these syncytia are a significant source of the released infectious dose. In stark contrast to these findings, bronchial epithelia reconstituted from children donors are intrinsically more resistant to virus infection and show active restriction of virus spread. This restriction is paired with accelerated release of IFN compared to adult donors. Taken together our findings reveal apical syncytia formation as an underappreciated source of infectious virus for either local dissemination or release into the environment. Furthermore, we provide direct evidence that children bronchial epithelia are more resistant to infection with SARS-CoV-2 providing experimental support for epidemiological observations that SARS-CoV-2 cases’ fatality is linked to age. Significance Statement Bronchial epithelia are the primary target for SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our work uses reconstituted bronchial epithelia from adults and children. We show that infection of adult epithelia with SARS-CoV-2 is rapid and results in the synchronized release of large clusters of infected cells and syncytia into the apical lumen contributing to the released infectious virus dose. Infection of children derived bronchial epithelia revealed an intrinsic resistance to infection and virus spread, probably as a result of a faster onset of interferon secretion. Thus, our data provide direct evidence for the epidemiological observation that children are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.","Beucher, Guillaume; Blondot, Marie-Lise; Celle, Alexis; Pied, Noémie; Recordon-Pinson, Patricia; Esteves, Pauline; Faure, Muriel; Métifiot, Mathieu; Lacomme, Sabrina; Dacheaux, Denis; Robinson, Derrick; Längst, Gernot; Beaufils, Fabien; Lafon, Marie-Edith; Berger, Patrick; Landry, Marc; Malvy, Denis; Trian, Thomas; Andreola, Marie-Line; Wodrich, Harald",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.28.446159,451

662197,Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in human post-mortem ocular tissues,2020-10-06,"BACKGROUND: As part of political and professional development with increased focus on including service users within mental health services, these services are being transformed. Specifically, they are shifting from institutional to noninstitutional care provision with increased integration of the use of electronic health and digitalization. In the period from March to May 2020, COVID-19 restrictions forced rapid changes in the organization and provision of mental health services through the increased use of digital solutions in therapy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and advance comprehensive knowledge about how therapists experience the use of video consultation (VC). To reach this objective, we evaluated therapists’ experiences of using VC in specialized mental health services in the early phase of COVID-19 restrictions. The following questions were explored through interviews: Which opportunities and challenges appeared when using VC during the period of COVID-19 restrictions? In a short-term care pathway, for whom does VC work and for whom does it not work? METHODS: This study employed a qualitative approach based on an abductive strategy and hermeneutic-phenomenological methodology. Therapists and managers in mental health departments in a hospital were interviewed via Skype for Business from March to May 2020, using a thematic interview guide that aimed to encourage reflections on the use of VC during COVID-19 restrictions. RESULTS: Therapists included in this study experienced advantages in using VC under circumstances that did not permit face-to-face consultations. The continuity that VC offered the service users was seen as a valuable asset. Various negative aspects concerning the therapeutic environment such as lack of safety for the most vulnerable service users and topics deemed unsuitable for VC lowered the therapists’ overall impression of the service. The themes that arose in the data analysis have been categorized in the following main topics: (1) VC—“it’s better than nothing”; (2) VC affects therapists’ work situation—opportunities and challenges in working conditions; and (3) challenges of VC when performing professional assessment and therapy on the screen. CONCLUSIONS: Experiences with VC in a mental health hospital during COVID-19 restrictions indicate that there are overall advantages to using VC when circumstances do not permit face-to-face consultations. Nevertheless, various negative aspects in the use of VC lowered the therapists’ overall impression of VC. Further qualitative research is needed, and future studies should focus on service users’ experiences, cocreation between different stakeholders, and how to scale up the use of VC while ensuring that the service provided is appropriate, safe, and available.","Gullslett, Monika K; Kristiansen, Eli; Nilsen, Etty R",JMIR Hum Factors,https://doi.org/10.2196/23150; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34096505/,451

In the bivariate analysis, there was no relationship between symptoms and the presence of disease, except for myalgias (p = 0.030). The multivariate analysis found a relationship between cough, dyspnea, fever, myalgia, anosmia / ageusia, and ocular symptoms and the presence of disease. Conclusions: the sensitivity and specificity for the Panbio rapid antigen test are similar to other studies performed in primary care. In high prevalence of disease and with highly suspected symptoms, positive test results can be considered definitive, but negative results will require confirmation. Myalgia, fever, dyspnea, anosmia / ageusia, and ocular symptoms may be more related to the presence of covid-19.","Cortés Rubio, JA; Costa Zamora, MP; Canals Aracil, M; Pulgar Feio, M; Mata Martínez, A; Carrasco Munera, A",Semergen,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semerg.2021.06.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34531125/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1138359321001751; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1138359321001751?v=s5,451
662858,Anti-inflammatory Therapy by Cholinergic and Purinergic Modulation in Multiple Sclerosis Associated with SARS-CoV-2 Infection,2021-07-11,"A variety of immunolabeling procedures for both light and electron microscopy were used to examine the cellular origins of the host membranes supporting the SARS-CoV-2 replication complex. The endoplasmic reticulum has long been implicated as a source of membrane for the coronavirus replication organelle. Using dsRNA as a marker for sites of viral RNA synthesis, we provide additional evidence supporting ER as a prominent source of membrane. In addition, we observed a rapid fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus which is visible by 6 h and complete by 12 h post-infection. Golgi derived lipid appears to be incorporated into the replication organelle although protein markers are dispersed throughout the infected cell. The mechanism of Golgi disruption is undefined, but chemical disruption of the Golgi apparatus by brefeldin A is inhibitory to viral replication. A search for an individual SARS-CoV-2 protein responsible for this activity identified at least five viral proteins, M, S, E, Orf6, and nsp3, that induced Golgi fragmentation when expressed in eukaryotic cells. Each of these proteins, as well as nsp4, also caused visible changes to ER structure as shown by correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM). Collectively, these results imply that specific disruption of the Golgi apparatus is a critical component of coronavirus replication.","Hackstadt, Ted; Chiramel, Abhilash I.; Hoyt, Forrest H.; Williamson, Brandi N.; Dooley, Cheryl A.; Beare, Paul A.; de Wit, Emmie; Best, Sonja M.; Fischer, Elizabeth R.",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13091798; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34578379/,451

Recent progress has been made in diagnostic imaging with the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorisms leading to an increase in the accuracy of exam interpretation and to the extraction of prognostic information useful in the decision-making process. Considering the ever expanding imaging data generated amid this pandemic, COVID-19 has catalyzed the rapid expansion in the application of AI to combat disease. In this context, many recent studies have explored the role of AI in each of the presumed applications for COVID-19 infection chest imaging, suggesting that implementing AI applications for chest imaging can be a great asset for fast and precise disease screening, identification and characterization. However, various biases should be overcome in the development of further ML-based algorithms to give them sufficient robustness and reproducibility for their integration into clinical practice. As a result, in this literature review, we will focus on the application of AI in chest imaging, in particular, deep learning, radiomics and advanced imaging as quantitative CT.","Laino, Maria Elena; Ammirabile, Angela; Posa, Alessandro; Cancian, Pierandrea; Shalaby, Sherif; Savevski, Victor; Neri, Emanuele",Diagnostics (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics11081317; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34441252/,451

The clinical characteristics of 213 post‐vaccination CVST cases notified to the European Medicines Agency are reported. METHODS: Data on adverse drug reactions after SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccination notified until 8 April 2021 under the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Term ‘Central nervous system vascular disorders’ were obtained from the EudraVigilance database. Post‐vaccination CVST was compared with 100 European patients with CVST from before the COVID‐19 pandemic derived from the International CVST Consortium. RESULTS: In all, 213 CVST cases were identified: 187 after AstraZeneca/Oxford (ChAdOx1 nCov‐19) vaccination and 26 after a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccination (25 with Pfizer/BioNTech, BNT162b2, and one with Moderna, mRNA‐1273). Thrombocytopenia was reported in 107/187 CVST cases (57%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 50%–64%) in the ChAdOx1 nCov‐19 group, in none in the mRNA vaccine group (0%, 95% CI 0%–13%) and in 7/100 (7%, 95% CI 3%–14%) in the pre‐COVID‐19 group. In the ChAdOx1 nCov‐19 group, 39 (21%) reported COVID‐19 polymerase chain reaction tests were performed within 30 days of CVST symptom onset, and all were negative. Of the 117 patients with a reported outcome in the ChAdOx1 nCov‐19 group, 44 (38%, 95% CI 29%–47%) had died, compared to 2/10 (20%, 95% CI 6%–51%) in the mRNA vaccine group and 3/100 (3%, 95% CI 1%–8%) in the pre‐COVID‐19 group. Mortality amongst patients with thrombocytopenia in the ChAdOx1 nCov‐19 group was 49% (95% CI 39%–60%). CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis occurring after ChAdOx1 nCov‐19 vaccination has a clinical profile distinct from CVST unrelated to vaccination.

Lacking scientific evidence, a very stringent but safer policy was imposed on liver transplant (LT) early in the pandemic. Restrictive transplant guidelines must be reevaluated and adjusted as data become available. Prior to LT, the prevailing policy requires a negative SARS-Cov-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of donors and recipients. Unfortunately, prolonged viral RNA shedding frequently hinders transplantation. Recent data reveal that positive test results for viral genome are frequently due to non-infectious and prolonged convalescent shedding of viral genome. Moreover, studies demonstrated that the cycle threshold of quantitative RT-PCR could be leveraged to inform clinical transplant decision-making. We present an evidence-adjusted significantly less restrictive policy for LT, where risk tolerance is tiered to recipient acuity. In addition, we delineate the pre-transplant clinical decision-making, intra- and postoperative management, and early outcome of two recipients of a liver graft performed while their RT-PCR of airway swabs remained positive. Convalescent positive RT-PCR results are common in the transplant arena, and the proposed policy permits reasonably safe LT in many circumstances.","Raveh, Yehuda; Simkins, Jacques; Vianna, Rodrigo; TEKIN, Akin; Nicolau-Raducu, Ramona",Transplant Proc,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2021.01.035; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0041134521000464?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33610305/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0041134521000464,451

So far, however, few published study has addressed the need for manpower reallocation needed in hospitals when such a serious contagious outbreak occurs. AIM: To quantify the demand elasticity of the major surgery types in order to guide future manpower reallocation during contagious outbreaks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on a nationwide research database in Taiwan, we extracted the monthly volumes of major surgery types for the period 1998–2003, which covered the SARS period, in order to carry out a time series analysis. The demand elasticity of each surgery type was then estimated by autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) analysis. RESULTS: During the study period, the surgical volumes of most selected surgery types either increased or remained steady. We categorized these surgery types into low-, moderate- and high-elastic groups according to their demand elasticity. Appendectomy, ‘open reduction of fracture with internal fixation’ and ‘free skin graft’ were in the low demand elasticity group. Transurethral prostatectomy and extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) were in the high demand elasticity group. The manpower of the departments carrying out the surgeries with low demand elasticity should be maintained during outbreaks. In contrast, departments in charge of surgeries mainly with high demand elasticity, like urology departments, may be in a position to have part of their staff reallocated. CONCLUSIONS: Taking advantage of the demand variation during the SARS period in 2003, we adopted the concept of demand elasticity and used a time series approach to figure out an effective index of demand elasticity for various types of surgery that could be used as a rational reference to carry out manpower reallocation during contagious outbreak situations.","Tsao, Hsiao-Mei; Sun, Ying-Chou; Liou, Der-Ming",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25837596/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0122625,451

Nevertheless, the extent of muscular involvement in infected subjects with no signs of myopathy has never been assessed with neurophysiological investigations. METHODS: Over a 3-week period — from April 30 through May 20, 2020 — a total of 70 patients were hospitalized in the Internal Medicine Ward of the Fondazione IRCCS Ca’ Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico in Milan, Italy. After excluding patients who underwent invasive ventilation and steroid treatment, 12 patients were evaluated. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) included the analysis of conduction velocity, amplitude, and latency for bilateral motor tibial, ulnar nerves, and sensory sural and radial nerves. Unilateral concentric-needle electromyography (EMG) was performed evaluating at least 4 areas of 8 selected muscles. For each muscle, spontaneous activity at rest, morphology, and recruitment of motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) were evaluated. RESULTS: While nerve conduction studies were unremarkable, needle electromyography showed myopathic changes in 6 out of 12 subjects. All patients were asymptomatic for muscular involvement. Clinical features and laboratory findings did not show relevant differences between patients with and without myopathic changes. CONCLUSION: Our data show that in SARS-CoV-2 infection muscular involvement can occur despite the absence of clinical signs or symptoms and should be considered part of the disease spectrum. The application of muscle biopsy to unravel the mechanisms of myofiber damage on tissue specimens could help to clarify the pathogenesis and the treatment response of coronavirus-mediated injury.

668261,The epidemiology of community‐acquired respiratory viruses during the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic,2020-12-02,"BACKGROUND: Periodontal disease is a chronic state of inflammation that can destroy the supporting tissues around the teeth, leading to the resorption of alveolar bone. The initial strategy for treating periodontal disease is non-surgical sanative therapy (ST). Periodontal disease can also induce dysbiosis in the gut microbiota and contribute to low-grade systemic inflammation. Prebiotic fibers such as inulin can selectively alter the intestinal microbiota and support homeostasis by improving gut barrier functions and preventing inflammation. Providing an inulin supplement prior to and post-ST may influence periodontal health while providing insight into the complex relationship between periodontal disease and the gut microbiota. The primary objective is to determine if inulin is more effective than the placebo at improving clinical periodontal outcomes including probing depth (PD) and bleeding on probing (BOP). Secondary objectives include determining the effects of inulin supplementation pre- and post-ST on salivary markers of inflammation and periodontal-associated pathogens, as these outcomes reflect more rapid changes that can occur. METHODS: We will employ a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study design and recruit and randomize 170 participants who are receiving ST to manage the periodontal disease to the intervention (inulin) or placebo (maltodextrin) group. A pilot study will be embedded within the randomized controlled trial using the first 48 participants to test the feasibility for the larger, powered trial. The intervention period will begin 4 weeks before ST through to their follow-up appointment at 10 weeks post-ST. Clinical outcomes of periodontal disease including the number of sites with PD ≥ 4 mm and the presence of BOP will be measured at baseline and post-ST. Salivary markers of inflammation, periodontal-associated pathogens, body mass index, and diet will be measured at baseline, pre-ST (after 4 weeks of intervention), and post-ST (after 14 weeks of intervention). DISCUSSION: We expect that inulin will enhance the positive effect of ST on the management of periodontal disease. The results of the study will provide guidance regarding the use of prebiotics prior to and as a supportive adjunct to ST for periodontal health. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04670133.

According to World Health Organization, the only way to curb this spread is by increasing the testing and isolating the infected. Meanwhile, the clinical testing currently being followed is not easily accessible and requires much time to give the results. In this scenario, remote diagnostic systems could become a handy solution. Some existing studies leverage the deep learning approach to provide an effective alternative to clinical diagnostic techniques. However, it is difficult to use such complex networks in resource constraint environments. To address this problem, we developed a fine-tuned deep learning model inspired by the architecture of the MobileNet V2 model. Moreover, the developed model is further optimized in terms of its size and complexity to make it compatible with mobile and edge devices. The results of extensive experimentation performed on a real-world dataset consisting of 2482 chest Computerized Tomography scan images strongly suggest the superiority of the developed fine-tuned deep learning model in terms of high accuracy and faster diagnosis time. The proposed model achieved a classification accuracy of 96.40%, with approximately ten times shorter response time than prevailing deep learning models.

In contrast to the popular concept of ‘learning from failure’, which involves intellectualizing the experience and distancing ourselves from it, our findings demonstrate the importance of a ‘present tense’ focus on emotions and affects in order to understand the experience of failure for students. Doing so brings us face-to-face with the often painful experience of failure in the present moment which, we argue, is an important and valid part of the university experience. We conclude by reflecting on the kinds of spaces and skills that may be needed to work with this new understanding of failure and show that developing these is a crucial part of resisting neoliberalism and creating a more ‘care-full’ (Mountz et al., 2015) academy.","Whittle, Rebecca; Brewster, Liz; Medd, Will; Simmons, Hilary; Young, Rob; Graham, Edith",Emot Space Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32904872/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.emospa.2020.100719; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755458620300669; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1755458620300669,451

Automatic segmentation of the COVID‐19 lesion area in CT images is an effective auxiliary medical technology which can quantitatively diagnose and judge the severity of the disease. In this paper, a multi‐class COVID‐19 CT image segmentation network is proposed, which includes a pyramid attention module to extract multi‐scale contextual attention information, and a residual convolution module to improve the discriminative ability of the network. A wavelet edge loss function is also proposed to extract edge features of the lesion area to improve the segmentation accuracy. For the experiment, a dataset of 4369 CT slices is constructed, including three symptoms: ground glass opacities, interstitial infiltrates, and lung consolidation. The dice similarity coefficients of three symptoms of the model achieve 0.7704, 0.7900, 0.8241 respectively. The performance of the proposed network on public dataset COVID‐SemiSeg is also evaluated.

As the world mobilizes to contain the COVID-19, scientists and public health experts are increasingly alarmed about the potentially catastrophic effects of an outbreak in Africa. The establishment of Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention by the Africa Union in 2017 was an unprecedented move toward strengthening national responses, so far enabling all fifty member states with confirmed cases of COVID-19 to adequately respond, break chains of transmission and effectively contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We enter an uncertain and challenging period that may severely test the preparedness, organizational resource and resilience of African states and the fabric of their societies.

We aimed at applying a queuing model to the Covid-19 screening area so as to optimize the screening services and ensuring that no patient is refused the service. METHODS: The mean arrival time of patients, number of physicians, mean screening time and queue characteristics were observed and entered in the M/M/c/K queuing model using R programming to optimize the number of physicians required in the screening area. RESULTS: Considering the mean arrival of 7 patients in 10 minutes and screening of 3 patients in 10 minutes by 1 physician, 2 physicians were assigned. At this capacity, the probability of saturation of the system was 15% with patient loss rate of 1.05 per 10 minutes. Queuing simulation with 3 physicians reduced the patient loss rate to 0.013 per 10 minutes and a saturation probability of 0.2%. However, an increase of arrival rate from 10 to 20 led to an early saturation of the system.

In the present study, we found that integrin α3β1 colocalizes with HAb18G/CD147 in human 7721 hepatoma cells. The enhancing effect of HAb18G/CD147 on adhesion, invasion capacities and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) secretion was decreased by integrin α3β1 antibodies (p<0.01). The expressions of integrin downstream molecules including focal adhesion kinase (FAK), phospho-FAK (p-FAK), paxillin, and phospho-paxillin (p-paxillin) were increased in human hepatoma cells overexpressing HAb18G/CD147. Deletion of HAb18G/CD147 reduces the quantity of focal adhesions and rearranges cytoskeleton. Wortmannin and LY294002, specific phosphatidylinositol kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, reversed the effect of HAb18G/CD147 on the regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization, significantly reducing cell adhesion, invasion and MMPs secretion potential (p<0.01). Together, these results suggest that HAb18G/CD147 enhances the invasion and metastatic potentials of human hepatoma cells via integrin α3β1-mediated FAK-paxillin and FAKPI3K-Ca(2+) signal pathways.","Tang, J.; Wu, Y.-M.; Zhao, P.; Yang, X.-M.; Jiang, J.-L.; Chen, Z.-N.",Cell Mol Life Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-008-8315-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18695939/,451

Deubiquitination by the deubiquitinating enzyme, deubiquitinase (DUB), is a reversible molecular process to remove Ub or Ub chains from the target proteins. Deubiquitination is an integral strategy within the UPS in regulating survival and proliferation of the infecting virus and the virus-invaded cells. Many viruses in the infected cells are reported to encode viral DUB, and these vial DUBs actively disrupt cellular Ub-dependent processes to suppress host antiviral immune response, enhancing virus replication and thus proliferation. This review surveys the types of DUBs encoded by different viruses and their molecular processes for how the infecting viruses take advantage of the DUB system to evade the host immune response and expedite their replication.","Proulx, Jessica; Borgmann, Kathleen; Park, In-Woo",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33922750/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22094438,451
674135,Detailed Multiplex Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Specific Antibodies in COVID-19 Disease,2021-06-10,"BACKGROUND: Medical personnel act as the protectors of people’s health by preventing, controlling, and treating emerging diseases, including the coronavirus infection. COVID-19 is a highly infectious and contagious disease which has presented the Iranian healthcare system with a variety of clinical challenges. There is a lack of research on clinical challenges in health crises especially those caused by emerging diseases, hence a need for more exploration of these clinical challenges and dilemmas. The present study aims to determine the different aspects of health professionals’ perception of the psychological safety of patients infected with the coronavirus (COVID-19). METHODS: The present study is a qualitative work which uses conventional content analysis. The participants were 17 health professionals who were responsible for COVID-19 patients and met the inclusion criteria. They were selected via purposeful sampling. The study lasted from February to March 2020. Data were collected through semi-structured, individual interviews which were conducted via video call. The collection of data was kept up to the point of saturation. The collected data were analyzed using the conventional content analysis method. RESULTS: Three themes such as “respect for dignity”, “comprehensive support” and “peaceful environment” with 11 categories were extracted from the findings of the study. CONCLUSION: According to the results of the present study, patients infected with the coronavirus should be given care in a peaceful environment where they receive comprehensive support and have their dignity respected. Such conditions can guarantee the psychological safety of these patients and produce positive behavioral results on their part. Thus, it is essential that the cultural, professional, and organizational prerequisites of protecting all the dimensions of the psychological safety of these patients be provided.","Mohammadi, Fateme; Farjam, Mojtaba; Gholampour, Yousef; Tehranineshat, Banafsheh; Oshvandi, Khodayar; Bijani, Mostafa",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32765133/; https://doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s261410,451

As of March 28, 2020, a total of 571,678 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 26,494 deaths have been reported worldwide (2). Reports from China and Italy suggest that risk factors for severe disease include older age and the presence of at least one of several underlying health conditions (3,4). U.S. older adults, including those aged ≥65 years and particularly those aged ≥85 years, also appear to be at higher risk for severe COVID-19-associated outcomes; however, data describing underlying health conditions among U.S. COVID-19 patients have not yet been reported (5). As of March 28, 2020, U.S. states and territories have reported 122,653 U.S. COVID-19 cases to CDC, including 7,162 (5.8%) for whom data on underlying health conditions and other known risk factors for severe outcomes from respiratory infections were reported. Among these 7,162 cases, 2,692 (37.6%) patients had one or more underlying health condition or risk factor, and 4,470 (62.4%) had none of these conditions reported. The percentage of COVID-19 patients with at least one underlying health condition or risk factor was higher among those requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission (358 of 457, 78%) and those requiring hospitalization without ICU admission (732 of 1,037, 71%) than that among those who were not hospitalized (1,388 of 5,143, 27%). The most commonly reported conditions were diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, and cardiovascular disease.

Recent reports have pointed to thrombosis with associated thrombocytopenia as an adverse effect occurring at a low frequency in some individuals after vaccination. The causes of such events may be related to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interactions with different C-type lectin receptors, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and the CD147 receptor, or to different soluble splice variants of the spike protein, adenovirus vector interactions with the CD46 receptor or platelet factor 4 antibodies. Similar findings have been reported for several viral diseases after vaccine administration. In addition, immunological mechanisms elicited by viral vectors related to cellular delivery could play a relevant role in individuals with certain genetic backgrounds. Although rare, the potential COVID-19 vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) requires immediate validation, especially in risk groups, such as the elderly, chronic smokers, and individuals with pre-existing incidences of thrombocytopenia; and if necessary, a reformulation of existing vaccines.","Lundstrom, Kenneth; Barh, Debmalya; Uhal, Bruce D.; Takayama, Kazuo; Aljabali, Alaa A.

An accelerated repurposing potential of antiviral herbs can provide usable drugs and identify druggable targets. In this study, we dissect the anti-coronavirus activity of Cissampelos pareira L (Cipa). using an integrative approach. Methods We analysed the signature similarities between predicted antiviral agents and Cipa using the connectivity map (https://clue.io/). Next, we tested the anti-SARS-COV-2 activity of Cipa in vitro. A three-way comparative analysis of Cipa transcriptome, COVID-19 BALF transcriptome and CMAP signatures of small compounds was also performed. Results Several predicted antivirals showed a high positive connectivity score with Cipa such as apcidin, emetine, homoharringtonine etc. We also observed 98% inhibition of SARS-COV-2 replication in infected Vero cell cultures with the whole extract. Some of its prominent pure constituents e.g pareirarine, cissamine, magnoflorine exhibited 40-80% inhibition. Comparison of genes between BALF and Cipa showed an enrichment of biological processes like transcription regulation and response to lipids, to be downregulated in Cipa while being upregulated in COVID-19.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire to elicit information on socio-economic and demographic characteristics, the types of stores visited to buy food, and FI screening. The FI experience was evaluated according to the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale. Factors associated with moderate or severe FI were investigated using the logistic regression model. SETTING: São Paulo city, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: Totally, 909 householders. RESULTS: Eighty-eight per cent of the households included young women working as cleaners or kitchen assistants and in sales services. One-fifth of the participants were involved in the federal cash transfer programme, called Bolsa Família. There were 92 % households with children. The most frequent experience reported was uncertainty about food acquisition or receiving more (89 %), eating less than one should (64 %), not being able to eat healthy and nutritious food (46 %), and skipping a meal (39 %). Forty-seven per cent of the participants experienced moderate or severe FI. Factors associated with moderate and severe FI were low income, being a Bolsa Família recipient, having a low level of education and living in a household without children. CONCLUSIONS: Half of the participants experienced moderate or severe FI, and almost 10 % experienced hunger. Our data suggest that families with children were at a lower risk of moderate to severe FI.

Activity of the Polish legislator is also essential, which tried to introduce solutions that would correspond with current expectations and needs. Given the multiplicity of the introduced regulations, interpretation of provisions of statutes has not always been easy. In this paper, the author points to the issues of communication with a public authority by specific reflections on the principles of serving documents on beneficiaries of EU programs under which they were awarded funding for their implementation on the basis of EU regulations addressing the use of the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund for programs implemented as part of the cohesion policy (Regulations of the European Parliament and of the Council (EU) of 17 December 2013: no. 1303/2013, no. 1301/2013, no. 1304/2013, no 1300/2013, and no. 1299/2013). The author focuses on the issues of communication with an authority in a situation where administrative proceedings are initiated against a beneficiary of EU funds, e.g., for returning the granted funding. The author points to the dynamics of the legislator’s work in this respect by analyzing the rules for serving documents by a public authority on beneficiaries who are public entities and those who are not. The author’s main research aim is to analyze existing provisions establishing the possibility of electronic communication with a public authority, and also to assess them critically due to the extraordinary situation caused by Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). This is intended to verify the main research hypothesis focusing on the attempt to answer a question whether existing regulations, and those created at the time of the epidemic threat and the state of epidemic in Poland facilitate citizens’ electronic communication with a public authority. The author aims to answer a question about whether the Polish legislator responds appropriately to the numerous emerging challenges associated with the pandemic and whether it created regulations that effectively ensure the possibility of continuity of contact with a public authority for citizens who are the beneficiaries of public funds. This analysis may contribute to the understanding of whether and how it is possible to improve citizens’ contact with public authorities, which in the future may eliminate barriers and obstacles arising in this regard. The author bases her reflections on the experience resulting from providing legal services for one of the Polish Managing Authorities of the Regional Operational Programme using at the same time a number of research methods (i.e., the method of interpretation of applicable laws to establish applicable provisions of the law that regulate admissibility of electronic communication with a public authority and to establish efficiency of such communication, the analytical method, applied in reference to the relevant state of the art in the achievements of legal scholarship, and the empirical method, based on observation and analysis of practical issues resulting from the author’s cooperation with a Polish managing authority). In her conclusions, the author points to the lack of introduction of comprehensive regulations (also at the EU level—for all EU Member States) in terms of de-formalizing the principles of communication in the course of pending administrative proceedings. The author notices an absence of unambiguous regulations that allow for a scanned document signed by hand and sent my email to be qualified into the category of documents served by electronic means, through use of means of electronic communication. The author assesses this absence negatively due to the fact that such action seems the simplest in a situation caused by COVID-19.","Klich, Aleksandra",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33466944/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18020685,451

Methods This was a retrospective descriptive study of adults who were admitted with critical COVID-19 for ≥ 24 hours. Data collected included demographic profiles and other baseline characteristics, laboratory and radiological investigations, medical interventions, and clinical outcomes. Outcomes of interest included presence or absence of co-infections and superinfections and in-hospital mortality. Differences between those with and without co-infections and superinfections were compared for statistical significance. Results We reviewed 321 patient records. Baseline characteristics included a median age (IQR) of 61.4 (51.4-72.9) years, male (71.3%) and African/black predominance (66.4%). Death occurred in 132 (44.1%) patients with significant difference noted between those with added infections (58.2%) compared to those with none (36.6%) (p = 0.002, odds ratio (OR) = 2.41). One patient had co-infection with pulmonary tuberculosis. Approximately two-thirds of patients received broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. Conclusion Added infections in critically ill COVID-19 patients were relatively uncommon but where present, were associated with higher mortality. Empiric use of broad spectrum antimicrobials was common and may have led to selection of multidrug resistant organisms.

Additional information is needed to determine mental health status among school-aged children and adolescents during this public health crisis and the risk factors associated with psychological distress during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To assess self-reported psychological distress among school-aged children and adolescents associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study using data from a survey on the mental health of school-aged children and adolescents in Guangdong province, China, conducted by using a stratified cluster random sampling method between March 8 to 30, 2020. To estimate outcomes associated with location of districts, only data from students with internet protocol addresses and current addresses in Guangdong were included. Data were analyzed from April 5 to July 20, 2020. EXPOSURE: Home-based distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The main outcome was self-reported psychological distress, measured using the total score on the 12-item General Health Questionnaire of 3 or greater. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze risk factors associated with mental health status. Odds ratios (ORs) were used to analyze the associations of factors with psychological distress. RESULTS: Among 1 310 600 students who completed the survey, 1 199 320 students (mean [SD] age, 12.04 [3.01] years; 619 144 [51.6%] boys) were included in the final analysis. A total of 126 355 students (10.5%) self-reported psychological distress. Compared with students in primary school, high school students had increased risk of psychological distress (OR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.15-1.23]). Compared with students who wore a face mask frequently, students who never wore a face mask had increased risk of psychological distress (OR, 2.59 [95% CI, 2.41-2.79]). Additionally, students who spent less than 0.5 hours exercising had increased odds of self-reported psychological distress compared with students who spent more than 1 hour exercising (OR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.61-1.67]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that the prevalence of self-reported psychological distress among students during the COVID-19 pandemic was relatively high. Frequency of wearing a face mask and time spent exercising were factors associated with mental health. Therefore, it may be necessary for governments, schools, and families to pay attention to the mental health of school-aged children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic and take corresponding countermeasures to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on students’ mental health.","Qin, Zuguo; Shi, Lei; Xue, Yaqing; Lin, Huang; Zhang, Jinchan; Liang, Pengyan; Lu, Zhiwei; Wu, Mengxiong; Chen, Yaguang; Zheng, Xiao; Qian, Yi; Ouyang, Ping; Zhang, Ruibin; Yi, Xuefeng; Zhang, Chichen",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33496797/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.35487,451

With the steady increase of AI applications in the medical field, the demand for quality medical data is increasing significantly. We here describe the development of a platform for providing and sharing digital pathology data to AI researchers, and highlight challenges to overcome in operating a sustainable platform in conjunction with pathologists. METHODS: Over 3000 pathological slides from five organs (liver, colon, prostate, pancreas and biliary tract, and kidney) in histologically confirmed tumor cases by pathology departments at three hospitals were selected for the dataset. After digitalizing the slides, tumor areas were annotated and overlaid onto the images by pathologists as the ground truth for AI training. To reduce the pathologists’ workload, AI-assisted annotation was established in collaboration with university AI teams. RESULTS: A web-based data sharing platform was developed to share massive pathological image data in 2019. This platform includes 3100 images, and 5 pre-processing algorithms for AI researchers to easily load images into their learning models. DISCUSSION: Due to different regulations among countries for privacy protection, when releasing internationally shared learning platforms, it is considered to be most prudent to obtain consent from patients during data acquisition. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limitations encountered during platform development and model training, the present medical image sharing platform can steadily fulfill the high demand of AI developers for quality data.

679494,Pandemic Woes: Antigen Tests to the Rescue?,2020-12-10,"Vaccinations are a crucial intervention in combating infectious diseases. The three neurotropic Alphaviruses, Eastern (EEEV), Venezuelan (VEEV), and Western (WEEV) equine encephalitis viruses, are pathogens of interest for animal health, public health, and biological defense. In both equines and humans, these viruses can cause febrile illness that may progress to encephalitis. Currently, there are no licensed treatments or vaccines available for these viruses in humans. Experimental vaccines have shown variable efficacy and may cause severe adverse effects. Here, we outline recent strategies used to generate vaccines against EEEV, VEEV, and WEEV with an emphasis on virus-vectored and plasmid DNA delivery. Despite candidate vaccines protecting against one of the three viruses, few studies have demonstrated an effective trivalent vaccine. We evaluated the potential of published vaccines to generate cross-reactive protective responses by comparing DNA vaccine sequences to a set of EEEV, VEEV, and WEEV genomes and determining the vaccine coverages of potential epitopes. Finally, we discuss future directions in the development of vaccines to combat EEEV, VEEV, and WEEV.","Stromberg, Zachary R.; Fischer, Will; Bradfute, Steven B.; Kubicek-Sutherland, Jessica Z.; Hraber, Peter",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32503232/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8020273,451

PDCoV was subsequently identified in the USA in 2014 in pigs with a history of severe diarrhea. The virus has now been detected in pigs in several countries around the world. Following the development of tissue culture adapted strains of PDCoV, it is now possible to address questions regarding virus–host cell interactions for this genera of coronavirus. Here, we presented a detailed study of PDCoV-induced replication organelles. All positive-strand RNA viruses induce the rearrangement of cellular membranes during virus replication to support viral RNA synthesis, forming the replication organelle. Replication organelles for the Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammacoronavirus genera have been characterized. All coronavirus genera induced the formation of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs). In addition, Alpha- and Betacoronaviruses induce the formation of convoluted membranes, while Gammacoronaviruses induce the formation of zippered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with tethered double-membrane spherules. However, the structures induced by Deltacoronaviruses, particularly the presence of convoluted membranes or double-membrane spherules, are unknown. Initially, the dynamics of PDCoV strain OH-FD22 replication were assessed with the onset of viral RNA synthesis, protein synthesis, and progeny particle release determined. Subsequently, virus-induced membrane rearrangements were identified in infected cells by electron microscopy. As has been observed for all other coronaviruses studied to date, PDCoV replication was found to induce the formation of double-membrane vesicles. Significantly, however, PDCoV replication was also found to induce the formation of regions of zippered endoplasmic reticulum, small associated tethered vesicles, and double-membrane spherules. These structures strongly resemble the replication organelle induced by avian Gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus.","Doyle, Nicole; Hawes, Philippa C.; Simpson, Jennifer; Adams, Lorin H.; Maier, Helena J.",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v11111030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694296/,451

Reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction testing on combined oral and nasopharyngeal swab (ONPS) suffers from several limitations, including the need for qualified personnel, the discomfort caused by invasive nasopharyngeal sample collection, and the possibility of swab and transport media shortage. Testing on saliva would represent an advancement. The aim of this study was to compare the concordance between saliva samples and ONPS for the detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 on various commercial and laboratory‐developed tests (LDT). Individuals were recruited from eight institutions in Quebec, Canada, if they had SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA detected on a recently collected ONPS, and accepted to provide another ONPS, paired with saliva. Assays available in the different laboratories (Abbott RealTime SARS‐CoV‐2, Cobas® SARS‐CoV‐2, Simplexa™ COVID‐19 Direct, Allplex™ 2019‐nCoV, RIDA®GENE SARS‐CoV‐2, and an LDT preceded by three different extraction methods) were used to determine the concordance between saliva and ONPS results. Overall, 320 tests were run from a total of 125 saliva and ONPS sample pairs. All assays yielded similar sensitivity when saliva was compared to ONPS, with the exception of one LDT (67% vs. 93%). The mean difference in cycle threshold (∆C (t)) was generally (but not significantly) in favor of the ONPS for all nucleic acid amplification tests. The maximum mean ∆​​​​​C (t) was 2.0, while individual ∆C (t) varied importantly from −17.5 to 12.4. Saliva seems to be associated with sensitivity similar to ONPS for the detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 by various assays.","Labbé, Annie‐Claude; Benoit, Patrick; Gobeille Paré, Sarah; Coutlée, François; Lévesque, Simon; Bestman‐Smith, Julie; Dumaresq, Jeannot; Lavallée, Christian; Houle, Claudia; Martin, Philippe; Mak, Anton; Gervais, Philippe; Langevin, Stéphanie; Jacob‐Wagner, Mariève; Gagnon, Simon; St‐Hilaire, Manon; Lussier, Nathalie; Yechouron, Ariane; Roy, David; Roger, Michel; Fafard, Judith",J Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33851739/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.27026,451

Awake proning is an attractive intervention in settings with limited resources, as it comes with no additional costs. However, awake proning remains poorly used probably because of unfamiliarity and uncertainties regarding potential benefits and practical application. To summarize evidence for benefit and to develop a set of pragmatic recommendations for awake proning in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, focusing on settings where resources are limited, international healthcare professionals from high and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) with known expertise in awake proning were invited to contribute expert advice. A growing number of observational studies describe the effects of awake proning in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in whom hypoxemia is refractory to simple measures of supplementary oxygen. Awake proning improves oxygenation in most patients, usually within minutes, and reduces dyspnea and work of breathing. The effects are maintained for up to 1 hour after turning back to supine, and mostly disappear after 6–12 hours. In available studies, awake proning was not associated with a reduction in the rate of intubation for invasive ventilation. Awake proning comes with little complications if properly implemented and monitored. Pragmatic recommendations including indications and contraindications were formulated and adjusted for resource-limited settings. Awake proning, an adjunctive treatment for hypoxemia refractory to supplemental oxygen, seems safe in non-intubated patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory failure. We provide pragmatic recommendations including indications and contraindications for the use of awake proning in LMICs.","Stilma, Willemke; Åkerman, Eva; Artigas, Antonio; Bentley, Andrew; Bos, Lieuwe D.; Bosman, Thomas J.

681179,French survey on a cohort of emergency general surgery modifications induced by lockdown of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,2021-01-15,"Background. Covid-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, is associated with significant respiratory-related morbidity and mortality. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been postulated as tentative pharmacological agents to treat Covid-19-induced lung inflammation. Trial design. This trial is a parallel group, randomized, two arm, open label, multicenter superiority trial with 1:1 allocation ratio. Methods. Participants included patients who were 18 years of age or older and who had been hospitalized with confirmed Covid-19 with 4 or fewer days since symptom onset. Exclusion criteria included intensive care unit admission prior to randomization and use of angiotensin receptor blocker or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors at admission. Participants in the treatment arm received telmisartan 80 mg bid during 14 days plus standard care. Participants in the control arm received standard care alone. Primary outcome was to achieve significant reductions in plasma levels of C-reactive protein in telmisartan treated Covid-19 patients at day 5 and 8 after randomization. Key secondary outcomes included time to discharge evaluated at 15 days after randomization and admission to ICU and death at 15- and 30-days post randomization. We present here a preliminary report. Results. A total of 78 patients were included in the interim analysis, 40 in the telmisartan and 38 in the control groups. CRP levels at day 5 in the control group were 51.1 +/- 44.8 mg/L (mean +/- SD; n=28) and in the telmisartan group were 24.2 +/- 31.4 mg/L (mean +/- SD; n=32, p<0.05). At day 8, CRP levels were 41.6 +/- 47.6 mg/L (mean +/- SD; n=16) and 9.0 +/- 10.0 mg/L (mean +/- SD; n=13, p < 0.05) in the control and telmisartan groups, respectively. Also, analysis of time to discharge by Kaplan-Meier method showed that telmisartan treated patients had statistically significant lower time to discharge (median time to discharge control group=15 days; telmisartan group=9 days). No differences were observed for ICU admission or death. No significant adverse events related to telmisartan were reported. Conclusions. In the present preliminary report, despite the small number of patients studied, ARB telmisartan, a well-known inexpensive safe antihypertensive drug, administered in high doses, demonstrates anti-inflammatory effects and improved morbidity in hospitalized patients infected with SARS -CoV-2, providing support for its use in this serious pandemia (NCT04355936).","Duarte, M.; Pelorosso, F.

681200,SARS-CoV-2 in first trimester pregnancy: a cohort study,2020-11-04,"The present study investigates the differences in inflammatory agents alterations, immune function, and leukocyte differential count evaluation in severe pneumonia of SARS-COV-2 patients with Yidu-toxicity blocking lung syndrome after the recommended Chinese medicine prescription of Yidu-toxicity blocking lung decoction. A total of 40 patients with yidu-toxicity blocking lung syndrome, diagnosed as severe pneumonia of SARS-COV-2 following the latest Chinese national recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia caused by SARS-COV-2 (the 5th edition), were recruited. They were randomly divided into the pure western medicine therapy group (PWM) and integrated into Chinese and Western medicine therapy group (ICW). The general strategies were given to both groups according to the national recommendations, and the ICW group was given Yidu-toxicity blocking lung decoction extraorally. A radioimmunoassay method was adopted to detect the content of IL-6, IL-8,IL-2R,TNF-α, procalcitonin (PCT) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in sera. Flow cytometry was used to determine the peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets (the levels of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and the ratios of CD4+/CD8+). The white blood cell counts (WBC#), neutrophils count(N#), and lymphocyte counts (L#) were measured using a fully automatic blood rheological instrument. The t test or Rank Sum Test and Spearman analysis were conducted to evaluate the differences. The results showed that IL-6 (P = 0.013) and TNF-α (P = 0.035) levels in the PWM group were significantly higher than those in the ICW group after treatment. Infection related indicators such as WBC#, N#, L#, hs-CRP showed no differences. The analysis showed that there was no statistical difference in the values of CD4 and CD8 between the two groups. By the end of Day 29, all patients were discharged and the final cure rate for both group were 100%. Taken together, we conclude that Yidu-toxicity blocking lung decoction could relieve inflammation of SARS-COV-2 patients with yidu-toxicity blocking lung syndrome by eliminating inflammatory agents. CM can serve as a complementary medication to western medicine, which should be highlighted in clinical settings.","Zhao, Jie; Yang, Xiaodong; Wang, Chenghua; Song, Shuai; Cao, Kun; Wei, Taohua; Ji, Qiaoxue; Zheng, Wanqun; Li, Jiali; Zhou, Xue; Liu, Jie",Biomed Pharmacother,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32768938/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332220306296?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110436; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0753332220306296,451

Music has been studied as a support for SMIs for decades, with promising results; however, a lack of synthesized evidence has precluded increased uptake of and access to music-based approaches. The purpose of this scoping review was to identify the types and quantity of research at intersections of music and SMIs, document evidentiary gaps and opportunities, and generate recommendations for improving research and practice. Studies were included if they reported on music's utilization in treating or mitigating symptoms related to five SMIs: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder. Eight databases were searched; screening resulted in 349 included studies for data extraction. Schizophrenia was the most studied SMI, with bipolar disorder studied the least. Demographics, settings, and activity details were found to be inconsistently and insufficiently reported; however, listening to recorded music emerged as the most common musical activity, and activity details appeared to have been affected by the conditions under study. RCTs were the predominant study design, and 271 unique measures were utilized across 289 primary studies. Over two-thirds of primary studies (68.5%) reported positive results, with 2.8% reporting worse results than the comparator, and 12% producing indeterminate results. A key finding is that evidence synthesis is precluded by insufficient reporting, widely varied outcomes and measures, and intervention complexity; as a result, widespread changes are necessary to reduce heterogeneity (as feasible), increase replicability and transferability, and improve understandings of mechanisms and causal pathways. To that end, five detailed recommendations are offered to support the sharing and development of information across disciplines.","Golden, Tasha L.; Springs, Stacey; Kimmel, Hannah J.; Gupta, Sonakshi; Tiedemann, Alyssa; Sandu, Clara C.; Magsamen, Susan",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33868127/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.649840,451

In chemistry, the discovery of reproducible patterns stimulates the imagination to develop new functional materials and technological or medical applications. Two clear examples are helical structures at different levels in biological polymers as well as ring and spherical structures of different size and composition. Rings are intuitively observed as holes able to thread elongated structures. A large number of real and fictional stories have rings as inanimate protagonists. The design, development or just discovering of a special ring has often been taken as a symbol of power or success. Several examples are the Piscatory Ring wore by the Pope of the Catholic Church, the NBA Championship ring and the One Ring created by the Dark Lord Sauron in the epic story The Lord of the Rings.

685060,Primary Immune Response Provides Protective Efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 Reinfection,2021,"Background: The aim of this study was to assess the drivers of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infection development in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its impact on patient outcome. Methods: Retrospective analysis on data from 32 consecutive patients with COVID-19, admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) from March to May 2020. Outcomes considered were MDR infection and ICU mortality. Results: Fifty percent of patients developed an MDR infection during ICU stay after a median time of 8 [4-11] days. Most common MDR pathogens were carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii, causing bloodstream infections and pneumonia. MDR infections were linked to a higher length of ICU stay (p = 0.002), steroid therapy (p = 0.011), and associated with a lower ICU mortality (odds ratio: 0.439, 95% confidence interval: 0.251-0.763; p < 0.001). Low-dose aspirin intake was associated with both MDR infection (p = 0.043) and survival (p = 0.015). Among MDR patients, mortality was related with piperacillin-tazobactam use (p = 0.035) and an earlier onset of MDR infection (p = 0.042). Conclusions: MDR infections were a common complication in critically ill COVID-19 patients at our center. MDR risk was higher among those dwelling longer in the ICU and receiving steroids. However, MDR infections were not associated with a worse outcome.","Karruli, Arta; Boccia, Filomena; Gagliardi, Massimo; Patauner, Fabian; Ursi, Maria Paola; Sommese, Pino; De Rosa, Rosanna; Murino, Patrizia; Ruocco, Giuseppe; Corcione, Antonio; Andini, Roberto; Zampino, Rosa; Durante-Mangoni, Emanuele",Microbial drug resistance,https://doi.org/10.1089/mdr.2020.0489; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33600262/,451

The conventional 'one drug, one virus' paradigm for antivirals does not adequately allow for proper preparedness in the face of unknown future epidemics. In addition, drug developers lack the financial incentives to work on antiviral drug discovery, with most pharmaceutical companies choosing to focus on more profitable disease areas. Safe-in-man broad spectrum antiviral agents (BSAAs) can help meet the need for antiviral development by already having passed phase I clinical trials, requiring less time and money to develop, and having the capacity to work against many viruses, allowing for a speedy response when unforeseen epidemics arise. In this chapter, we discuss the benefits of repurposing existing drugs as BSAAs, describe the major steps in safe-in-man BSAA drug development from discovery through clinical trials, and list several database resources that are useful tools for antiviral drug repositioning.","Yao, Rouan; Ianevski, Aleksandr; Kainov, Denis",Adv Exp Med Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34258746/; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-0267-2_12,451

Following extraction by the two methods, all samples were analyzed by Real-time RT-PCR. Results revealed that the use of the standard Maxwell 16 protocol (Maxwell 16-S) resulted in good linearity and precision across a wide concentration range and higher sensitivity of detection from flu-v stock suspensions than the manual method. Compared with the latter method, Maxwell 16-S extracted RNA more efficiently (higher RNA yield and/or fewer PCR inhibitors) from throat swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, while both methods performed comparably on fecal samples from human and poultry in terms of overall threshold cycle values and detection rates although the Maxwell 16-S co-purified more inhibitors from fecal samples. The capacity of this system to remove inhibitors from fecal matrix was improved by using a modified Maxwell 16 protocol with a reduced sample input, which eliminated all false-negatives produced by the Maxwell 16-S. These findings suggest that the Maxwell 16 System is suitable for RNA extraction from multiple-source samples for diagnosis of influenza and viral load determination and that a proper reduction in starting sample volume may improve the detection of flu-v from complex matrices such as feces. Additionally, this system allows flexible sample throughput and labor-saving sample processing with little or no risk of cross-contamination.","Liu, Hongbo; Gan, Yan; Yang, Bo; Weng, Hui; Huang, Chunmei; Yang, Daofeng; Lei, Ping; Shen, Guanxin",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0048094; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23144730/,451
686441,Sensitivity and specificity of SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit in COVID-19 serology assays,2020-10-27,"Infection of the central nervous system by murine polyomavirus (MuPyV), a persistent natural mouse pathogen, establishes brain-resident memory CD8 T cells (bT(RM)) that uniformly and chronically express PD-1 irrespective of expression of the α(E) integrin CD103, a T(RM) cell marker. In contrast, memory antiviral CD8 T cells in the spleen are PD-1(−), despite viral loads being similar in both the brain and spleen during persistent infection. Repetitive antigen engagement is central to sustained PD-1 expression by T cells in chronic viral infections; however, recent evidence indicates that expression of inhibitory receptors, including PD-1 is part of the T(RM) differentiation program. Here, we asked whether PD-1 expression by CD8 bT(RM) cells during persistent MuPyV encephalitis is antigen-dependent. By transferring MuPyV-specific CD8 bT(RM) cells into brains of naive mice and mice infected with cognate epitope-sufficient and -deficient MuPyVs, we demonstrate that antigen and inflammation are dispensable for PD-1 maintenance. In vitro and direct ex vivo analyses indicate that CD103(−) MuPyV-specific CD8 bT(RM) retain functional competence. We further show that the Pdcd-1 promoter of anti-MuPyV bT(RM) cells is epigenetically fixed in a demethylated state in the brain. In contrast, the PD-1 promoter of splenic antiviral memory CD8 T cells undergoes remethylation after being demethylated during acute infection. These data show that PD-1 expression is an intrinsic property of brain T(RM) cells in a persistent CNS viral infection.","Shwetank,; Abdelsamed, Hossam A.; Frost, Elizabeth L.; Schmitz, Heather M.; Mockus, Taryn E.; Youngblood, Ben A.; Lukacher, Aron E.",Immunol Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28829048/; https://doi.org/10.1038/icb.2017.62,451

In part, the development of new treatments has been hampered by an imperfect understanding of the biological processes that trigger ALS and promote disease progression. Advances in our understanding of these biological processes, including the causative genetic mutations, and of the influence of environmental factors have deepened our appreciation of disease pathophysiology. The consequent identification of pathogenic targets means that the introduction of effective therapies is becoming a realistic prospect. Progress in precision medicine, including genetically targeted therapies, will undoubtedly change the natural history of ALS. The evolution of clinical trial designs combined with improved methods for patient stratification will facilitate the translation of novel therapies into the clinic. In addition, the refinement of emerging biomarkers of therapeutic benefits is critical to the streamlining of care for individuals.

We found that distinct features of IgG Fab and Fc domain structures were present within three days of a positive test that predicted two separate disease trajectories in a prospective cohort of patients with COVID-19. One trajectory was defined by early production of neutralizing antibodies and led to mild disease. A distinct trajectory, characterized by an initial period of mild symptoms followed by rapid progression to more severe outcomes, was predicted by the absence of early neutralizing antibody responses with concomitant production of afucosylated IgGs. Elevated frequencies of monocytes expressing the receptor for afucosylated IgGs, FcγRIIIa (CD16a), were an additional antecedent in patients with the more severe outcomes. In mechanistic studies, afucosylated immune complexes in the lung triggered an inflammatory infiltrate and cytokine production that was dependent on CD16a. Finally, in healthy subjects, mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination elicited neutralizing antibodies that were enriched for Fc fucosylation and sialylation and distinct from both infection-induced trajectories. These data show the importance of combined Fab and Fc domain functions in the antiviral response, define an early antibody signature in people who progressed to more severe COVID-19 outcomes and have implications for novel therapeutic strategies targeting FcγRIIIa pathways.","Chakraborty, Saborni; Gonzalez, Joseph C.; Sievers, Benjamin L.; Mallajosyula, Vamsee; Dubey, Megha; Cheng, Bowie Yik-Ling; Tran, Kim Quyen Thi; Chakraborty, Srijoni; Cassidy, Arianna; Chen, Steven T.; Sinnott, Aanika; Gelbart, Terri; Golan, Yarden; Prahl, Mary; Singh, Upinder; Kim-Schulze, Seunghee; Sherwood, Robert; Zhang, Sheng; Marron, Thomas U.; Gnjatic, Sacha; Gaw, Stephanie L.; Nadeau, Kari C.; Merad, Miriam; Jagannathan, Prasanna; Tan, Gene S.; Wang, Taia T.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.25.445649; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34075376/,451

Excision biopsy is generally recommended for clinically suspicious pigmented lesions; however, a proportion of cutaneous melanomas are diagnosed by shave biopsy. A systematic review was undertaken to investigate the impact of shave biopsy on tumor staging, treatment recommendations, and prognosis. METHODOLOGY: The MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for relevant articles. Data on deep margin status on shave biopsy, tumor upstaging, and additional treatments on wide local excision (WLE), disease recurrence, and survival effect were analyzed across studies. RESULTS: Fourteen articles from 2010 to 2020 were included. In total, 3713 patients had melanoma diagnosed on shave biopsy. Meta-analysis revealed a positive deep margin in 42.9% of shave biopsies. Following WLE, change in tumor stage was reported in 7.7% of patients. Additional treatment was recommended for 2.3% of patients in the form of either further WLE and/or sentinel lymph node biopsy. There was high heterogeneity across studies in all outcomes. Four studies reported survival, while no studies found any significant difference in disease-free or overall survival between shave biopsy and other biopsy modalities. CONCLUSIONS: Just over 40% of melanomas diagnosed on shave biopsy report a positive deep margin; however, this translated into a change in tumor stage or treatment recommendations in relatively few patients (7.7% and 2.3%, respectively), with no impact on local recurrence or survival among the studies analyzed.","Ahmadi, Omid; Das, Moushumi; Hajarizadeh, Behzad; Mathy, Jon A.",Ann Surg Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33782802/; https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-021-09866-3,451

The key priority is to contain the epidemic and prevent the infection rate. In this context, many countries are now in some degree of lockdown to ensure extreme social distancing of entire population and hence slowing down the epidemic spread. Furthermore, authorities use case quarantine strategy and manual second/third contact-tracing to contain the COVID-19 disease. However, manual contact-tracing is time-consuming and labor-intensive task which tremendously over-load public health systems. In this paper, we developed a smartphone-based approach to automatically and widely trace the contacts for confirmed COVID-19 cases. Particularly, contact-tracing approach creates a list of individuals in the vicinity and notifying contacts or officials of confirmed COVID-19 cases. This approach is not only providing awareness to individuals they are in the proximity to the infected area, but also tracks the incidental contacts that the COVID-19 carrier might not recall. Thereafter, we developed a dashboard to provide a plan for policymakers on how lockdown/mass quarantine can be safely lifted, and hence tackling the economic crisis. The dashboard used to predict the level of lockdown area based on collected positions and distance measurements of the registered users in the vicinity. The prediction model uses k-means algorithm as an unsupervised machine learning technique for lockdown management.","Maghdid, Halgurd S.; Ghafoor, Kayhan Zrar",SN COMPUT,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33063052/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s42979-020-00290-0,451

Reliable serologic assays with independent validation are required. METHODS: Six SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays from Beckman Coulter, Euroimmun (IgG, IgA), Roche, and Siemens (Centaur, Vista) were assessed for specificity (n = 184), sensitivity (n = 154), and seroconversion in a defined cohort with clinical correlates and molecular SARS-CoV-2 results. RESULTS: Assay specificity was 99% or greater for all assays except the Euroimmun IgA (95%). Sensitivity at more than 21 days from symptom onset was 84%, 95%, 72%, 98%, 67%, and 96% for Beckman Coulter, Centaur, Vista, Roche, Euroimmun IgA, and Euroimmun IgG, respectively. Average day of seroconversion was similar between assays (8-10 d), with 2 patients not producing nucleocapsid antibodies during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibodies may be less reliably produced early in disease than spike protein antibodies. Assessment of convalescent plasma donors at more than 30 days from symptom onset and seroprevalence studies should use assays with defined sensitivity at time points of interest because not all assays detected antibodies reliably at more than 30 days.","Zilla, Megan; Wheeler, Bradley J; Keetch, Christian; Mitchell, Gretchen; McBreen, Jeffrey; Wells, Alan; Shurin, Michael R; Peck-Palmer, Octavia; Wheeler, Sarah E",Am J Clin Pathol,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcp/aqaa228; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33155015/,451

Here, we showed that ACE2 protein levels were significantly downregulated after infection with H1N1 viruses but was dispensable for viral replication. ACE2 protein downregulation was most likely related to ACE2 protein degradation by proteasome pathway rather than ACE2 shedding.

His glucose was 71 mg/dL, aspartate transaminase (AST) 119 U/L, and alanine transaminase (ALT) 65 U/L. Hypoglycemia was treated with juice, and 12 hours later AST and ALT were 979 U/L and 700 U/L, respectively. Workup for infectious, autoimmune, metabolic, and toxic causes of hepatitis was negative. The transaminases improved by the next day and normalized within 3 weeks. Two weeks after discharge the patient returned with hypoglycemia, nausea, and right-sided abdominal pain of 13 hours. Hypoglycemia persisted despite multiple courses of glucose tablets and juice. Laboratory studies showed glucose of 58 mg/dL, AST of 776 U/L, ALT of 496 U/L, negative toxicology studies, and normal abdominal ultrasound. His serum insulin level was 249.7 mU/L and, C-peptide was less than 0.1 ng/mL, consistent with insulin overdose. He received IV fluids with dextrose, and insulin was held. Transaminases improved by the following day. Repeat serum insulin while on home regimen was normal.

We capitalise on the unique restrictions during COVID19 to understand how time of day of daylight exposure and outside exercise interact with chronotype and sleep quality. 3474 people from the UK (median age 62, range 18 to 91) completed our online 'SleepQuest' Study between 29th April and 13th May 2020 - a set of validated questionnaires probing sleep quality, depression, anxiety and attitudes to sleep alongside bespoke questions on the effect of COVID19 lockdown on sleep, time spent outside and exercising and self-help sleep measures. Significantly more people (n=1252) reported worsened than improved sleep (n=562) during lockdown (p<0.0001). Factors significantly associated with worsened sleep included low mood (p<0.001), anxiety (p<0.001) and suspected, proven or at risk of COVID19 symptoms (all p<0.03). Sleep improvement was related to the increased length of time spent outside (P<0.01). Older people's sleep quality was less affected than younger people by COVID19 lockdown (p<0.001). Better sleep quality was associated with going outside and exercising earlier, rather than later, in the day. However, the benefit of being outside early is driven by improved sleep in 'owl' (p=0.0002) and not 'lark' (p=0.27) chronotype, whereas, the benefit of early exercise (inside or outside) did not depend on chronotype. Defining the interaction between chronotype, mental health and behaviour will be critical for targeted lifestyle adaptations to protect brain health through current and future crises.","Carrigan, Neil; Wearn, Alfie R; Meky, Saba; Selwood, James; Piggins, Hugh; Turner, Nicholas; Greenwood, Rosemary; Coulthard, Elizabeth",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.08.20148171v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.08.20148171,451
