216,Antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of Cortex Magnoliae Officinalis and some other medicinal plants commonly used in South-East Asia,2008-11-28,"BACKGROUND: Eight medicinal plants were tested for their antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. Different extraction methods were also tested for their effects on the bioactivities of the medicinal plants. METHODS: Eight plants, namely Herba Polygonis Hydropiperis (Laliaocao), Folium Murraya Koenigii (Jialiye), Rhizoma Arachis Hypogea (Huashenggen), Herba Houttuyniae (Yuxingcao), Epipremnum pinnatum (Pashulong), Rhizoma Typhonium Flagelliforme (Laoshuyu), Cortex Magnoliae Officinalis (Houpo) and Rhizoma Imperatae (Baimaogen) were investigated for their potential antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. RESULTS: Extracts of Cortex Magnoliae Officinalis had the strongest activities against M. Smegmatis, C. albicans, B. subtilis and S. aureus. Boiled extracts of Cortex Magnoliae Officinalis, Folium Murraya Koenigii, Herba Polygonis Hydropiperis and Herba Houttuyniae demonstrated greater antioxidant activities than other tested medicinal plants. CONCLUSION: Among the eight tested medicinal plants, Cortex Magnoliae Officinalis showed the highest antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. Different methods of extraction yield different spectra of bioactivities.","Chan, Lai Wah; Cheah, Emily LC; Saw, Constance LL; Weng, Wanyu; Heng, Paul WS",Chin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2631514/,110
5282,The public perception of the value of vaccines - the case of Switzerland,2008-06-27,"A number of different laboratories reported on studies with orally administered interferons and cytokines. Their observations extend previous observations which showed that orally administered interferons and cytokines can exert both local and systemic effects. As difficult as it may be to understand how orally administered interferons and cytokines may exert both effects, the increasing number of laboratories that demonstrate biological effects with orally administered cytokines suggests that serious consideration be given to the possibility that orally administered interferons and cytokines can indeed exert effects. They also raise the possibility that these effects may have biological relevance for the treatment of human disease. Moreover, they may indicate that the nasal/oral region is a window on the environment. It is most important, however, to assure that these experiments are performed with special care to avoid presenting preliminary data that is not properly controlled. It is essential to carry out these studies with sufficient animals or patients to ascertain their significance; and to plan the studies as double-blind evaluations to avoid misinterpretations when subjective tests are used. Nevertheless, the overall data presented give one the impression of an area that should be pursued.","Georgiades, Jerzy A.; Fleischmann, W.

12010,Thoughts of a Premedical Student on the Current State of the Medical School Application Process,2020-07-14,"Sleep apnea causes cognitive deficits and is associated with several neurologic diseases. Intermittent hypoxia (IH) is recognized as a principal mediator of pathophysiology associated with sleep apnea, yet the basis by which IH contributes to impaired cognition remains poorly defined. Using a mouse model exposed to IH, this study examines how the transcription factor, hypoxia inducible factor 1a (HIF1a), contributes to disrupted synaptic physiology and spatial memory. In wild-type mice, impaired performance in the Barnes maze caused by IH coincided with a loss of NMDA receptor (NMDAr)-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) in area CA1 and increased nuclear HIF1a within the hippocampus. IH-dependent HIF1a signaling caused a two-fold increase in expression of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating enzyme NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4). These changes promoted a pro-oxidant state and the downregulation of GluN1 within the hippocampus. The IH-dependent effects were not present in either mice heterozygous for Hif1a (HIF1a(+/−)) or wild-type mice treated with the antioxidant manganese (III) tetrakis(1-methyl-4-pyridyl) porphyrin (MnTMPyP). Our findings indicate that HIF1a-dependent changes in redox state are central to the mechanism by which IH disrupts hippocampal synaptic plasticity and impairs spatial memory. This mechanism may enhance the vulnerability for cognitive deficit and lower the threshold for neurologic diseases associated untreated sleep apnea.","Arias-Cavieres, Alejandra; Khuu, Maggie A.; Nwakudu, Chinwendu U.; Barnard, Jasmine E.; Dalgin, Gokhan; Garcia, Alfredo J.",eNeuro,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7363479/,110

15577,The design and implementation of a longitudinal social medicine curriculum at the University of Vermont’s Larner College of Medicine,2021-02-24,"The term “giant cell myositis” has been used to refer to muscle diseases characterized histologically by multinucleated giant cells. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune neuromuscular junction disorder. The rare concurrence of giant cell myositis with myasthenia gravis has been reported; however, the clinical and histological features have varied widely. Here, we present such a case and a review of the literature. An 82-year-old woman admitted for subacute, progressive, proximal muscle weakness developed acute-onset dysphagia, dysphonia, and respiratory distress 5 days after admission. Laboratory findings were positive for acetylcholine receptor binding antibodies and striational muscle antibodies against titin. Muscle biopsy demonstrated widespread muscle fiber necrosis with multinucleated giant cells, consistent with giant cell myositis. She died despite treatment with pulse methylprednisolone and plasma exchange. A literature review of the PubMed and Scopus databases from 1944 to 2020 identified 15 additional cases of these co-existing diagnoses. We found that giant cell myositis with myasthenia gravis primarily affects female patients, is typically diagnosed in the 6–7th decades, and is characterized by the presence of thymoma. Muscle histology predominantly shows giant cell infiltrate without granulomas. The onset of myasthenia gravis symptoms may precede, follow, or coincide with symptoms of myositis. Treatment with thymectomy, anticholinesterase inhibitors, or immunosuppressive therapy may lead to favorable clinical outcomes.","Scangarello, Frank A; Angel-Buitrago, Luisa; Lang-Orsini, Melanie; Geevarghese, Alexander; Arkun, Knarik; Soto, Oscar; Vullaganti, Mithila; Kalish, Robert",Clin Rheumatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7904393/,110
17206,Medical Students Respond: Question Precision and Gender Differentiation. Comment on “Understanding Medical Students’ Attitudes Toward Learning eHealth: Questionnaire Study”,2021-02-11,"BACKGROUND: The relationship between physical activity and mental health, especially the symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), has received increasing attention in recent years. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the association between fulfilling the World Health Organization (WHO) global recommendations on physical activity and the risk and symptoms of MDD and GAD in the Saudi population. METHODS: This study was a secondary analysis of data from a large nationwide cross-sectional survey conducted via phone interviews in June and July 2020. In this study, a proportional quota sampling technique was used to obtain an equal distribution of participants, stratified by age and gender, across the 13 regions of Saudi Arabia. The main mental health screening tool used for the risk of MDD was the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Risk of GAD was measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale. Participants self-reported whether they fulfill the WHO global recommendations on (1) moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity (MIPA) and (2) vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity (VIPA). The results were then analyzed based on the following two categories: fulfilling the WHO global recommendations or not. RESULTS: The data analysis included 8333 participants recruited in the main study between June and July 2020. The response rate was 81.45% (8333/10,231). Of them, 50.3% (4192/8333) were female, and the mean age was 36.5 years, with a median age of 36 years and a range from 18 to 90 years. The average total PHQ-9 score was 5.61, and the average total GAD-7 score was 4.18. For men, the average total PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores were associated with fulfilling recommendations for MIPA; however, there were no associations for VIPA in both sexes. Fulfilling the WHO’s recommendations for MIPA was associated with considerably fewer depressive symptoms in six of the nine items in the PHQ-9. Moreover, fulfilling recommendations for MIPA was associated with considerably fewer anxiety symptoms in six of the seven items in the GAD-7. However, fulfilling recommendations for VIPA was significantly associated with more depressive symptoms in one of the PHQ-9 items (“Thoughts that you would be better off dead or thoughts of hurting yourself in some way;” P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that fulfilling guidelines on MIPA is associated with less overall risk of MDD and GAD in males and fewer depressive and anxiety symptoms generally in a nonclinical population. In the general population, an increase in MIPA may improve well-being and general mental health.","Althumiri, Nora A; Basyouni, Mada H; BinDhim, Nasser F",JMIR Public Health Surveill,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8082387/,110
17573,Distribution of genotypes in relation to metronidazole susceptibility patterns in Trichomonas vaginalis isolated from South African pregnant women,2021-05-18,"Fc gamma receptors (FcγR) are cell surface glycoproteins which trigger specific effector-cell responses when cross-linked with the Fc portions of immunoglobulin (IgG) antibodies. During HIV-1 infection, the course of disease progression, ART response, and viral reservoir size vary in different individuals. Several factors may account for these differences; however, Fc gamma receptor gene polymorphisms, which influence receptor binding to IgG antibodies, are likely to play a key role. FcγRIIa (CD32) was recently reported as a potential marker for latent HIV reservoir, however, this assertion is still inconclusive. Whether FcγR polymorphisms influence the size of the viral reservoir, remains an important question in HIV cure studies. In addition, potential cure or viral suppression methods such as broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAbs) may depend on FcγRs to control the virus. Here, we discuss the current evidence on the potential role played by FcγR polymorphisms in HIV-1 infection, treatment and vaccine trial outcomes. Importantly, we highlight contrasting findings that may be due to multiple factors and the relatively limited data from African populations. We recommend further studies especially in sub-Saharan Africa to confirm the role of FcγRIIa in the establishment of latent reservoir and to determine their influence in therapies involving bNAbs.","Lamptey, Helena; Bonney, Evelyn Y.; Adu, Bright; Kyei, George B.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8129575/,110

17982,Public Attitudes towards Medicinal Waste and Medicines Reuse in a ‘Free Prescription’ Healthcare System,2021-04-08,"Cerebrovascular diseases are pathological conditions involving impaired blood flow in the brain, primarily including ischaemic stroke, intracranial haemorrhage, and subarachnoid haemorrhage. The nucleotide-binding and oligomerisation (NOD) domain-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain (PYD)-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a protein complex and a vital component of the immune system. Emerging evidence has indicated that the NLRP3 inflammasome plays an important role in cerebrovascular diseases. The function of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular diseases remains an interesting field of research. In this review, we first summarised the pathological mechanism of cerebrovascular diseases and the pathological mechanism of the NLRP3 inflammasome in aggravating atherosclerosis and cerebrovascular diseases. Second, we outlined signalling pathways through which the NLRP3 inflammasome participates in aggravating or mitigating cerebrovascular diseases. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)/nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), ROS/thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) and purinergic receptor-7 (P2X7R) signalling pathways can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome; activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome can aggravate cerebrovascular diseases by mediating apoptosis and pyroptosis. Autophagy/mitochondrial autophagy, nuclear factor E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), interferon (IFN)-β, sirtuin (SIRT), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) reportedly alleviate cerebrovascular diseases by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Finally, we explored specific inhibitors of the NLRP3 inflammasome based on the two-step activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which can be developed as new drugs to treat cerebrovascular diseases.","Bai, Rongrong; Lang, Yue; Shao, Jie; Deng, Yu; Refuhati, Reyisha; Cui, Li",ASN Neuro,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8168029/,110

In general, influenza A viruses are more pathogenic than are influenza B viruses. Influenza A virus is a zoonotic infection, and more than 100 types of influenza A viruses infect most species of birds, pigs, horses, dogs, and seals.

26416,The Physical Burden of Immunoperception,2019-04-27,"Emerging viruses are viruses that appear suddenly in the human population. These are viruses to which man has no history of exposure and thus no or limited immunity; they are not new evolutionary creations, but are viruses than man meets due to environmental changes, such as deforestation, entering into new habitats, or viruses that are transmitted from one species of animal to humans. Most of these viruses are terrifying, and cause hemorrhagic fever, a complete destruction of the circulation system; they include Lassa fever, Nipah virus, Ebola, HIV, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and, recently, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which is the latest in a series of “new” respiratory viruses infecting man. It is possible that unknown emerging viruses are the cause of death, often listed as “death due to an unknown cause,” as in the retrospective cases of HIV. Emerging viruses might also include poliovirus and influenza, since their introduction into the human population is (was) often sudden and due to changes in the environment or due to contact with other animal species. For examples, polio was a result of changes in sanitation in the countries of North America and Western Europe, and influenza is constantly jumping from aquatic birds to man and other animal species where genomic reassortment occurs.","Taylor, Milton W.",Viruses and Man: A History of Interactions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123315/,110

32474,Air pollution reduction and mortality benefit during the COVID-19 outbreak in China,2020-05-13,"Multidimensional data appear in various interesting applications, e.g., sales data indexed by stores, items, and time. Oftentimes, data are observed aggregated over multiple data atoms, thus exhibit low resolution. Temporal aggregation is most common, but many datasets are also aggregated over other attributes. Multidimensional data, in particular, are sometimes available in multiple coarse views, aggregated across different dimensions – especially when sourced by different agencies. For instance, item sales can be aggregated temporally, and over groups of stores based on their location or affiliation. However, data in finer granularity significantly benefit forecasting and data analytics, prompting increasing interest in data disaggregation methods. In this paper, we propose Tendi, a principled model that efficiently disaggregates multidimensional (tensor) data from multiple views, aggregated over different dimensions. Tendi employs coupled tensor factorization to fuse the multiple views and provide recovery guarantees under realistic conditions. We also propose a variant of Tendi, called TendiB, which performs the disaggregation task without any knowledge of the aggregation mechanism. Experiments on real data from different domains demonstrate the high effectiveness of the proposed methods.","Almutairi, Faisal M.; Kanatsoulis, Charilaos I.; Sidiropoulos, Nicholas D.",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206359/,110
33682,Zoonoses and Other Human Health Hazards,2013-10-21,"This paper addresses the challenge of automated remodularization of large systems as microservices. It focuses on the analysis of enterprise systems, which are widely used in corporate sectors and are notoriously large, monolithic and challenging to manually decouple because they manage asynchronous, user-driven business processes and business objects (BOs) having complex structural relationships. The technique presented leverages semantic knowledge of enterprise systems, i.e., BO structure, together with syntactic knowledge of the code, i.e., classes and interactions as part of static profiling and clustering. On a semantic level, BOs derived from databases form the basis for prospective clustering of classes as modules, while on a syntactic level, structural and interaction details of classes provide further insights for module dependencies and clustering, based on K-Means clustering and optimization. Our integrated techniques are validated using two open source enterprise customer relationship management systems, SugarCRM and ChurchCRM. The results demonstrate improved feasibility of remodularizing enterprise systems (inclusive of coded BOs and classes) as microservices. Furthermore, the recommended microservices, integrated with ‘backend’ enterprise systems, demonstrate improvements in key non-functional characteristics, namely high execution efficiency, scalability and availability.","De Alwis, Adambarage Anuruddha Chathuranga; Barros, Alistair; Fidge, Colin; Polyvyanyy, Artem",Advanced Information Systems Engineering,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7266467/,110
33753,What Contributes to Stigma Towards Autistic University Students and Students with Other Diagnoses?,2020-06-05,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine exposure to vector-borne pathogens (VBPs) in populations of dogs living on Greek islands in the Ionian and Aegean seas. METHODS: In total, 1154 dogs with different lifestyles and of varying ages and breeds were randomly sampled and examined for the presence of clinical signs compatible with canine vector-borne diseases (CVBDs). Blood was collected from each individual animal. For the detection of antibodies against Leishmania spp., the WITNESS® Leishmania test was performed, and positive samples were further examined with indirect enzymatic immunoassay (ELISA). Antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi, Ehrlichia canis or E. ewingii, as well as Anaplasma phagocytophilum or A. platys were investigated using the Snap® 4Dx® Plus test. Positive Ehrlichia spp. and Anaplasma spp. samples were further examined using an indirect ELISA for further identification of the species. RESULTS: In total, 25.6% of dogs were exposed to at least one of the pathogens investigated, with seroprevalences varying regionally. Of these seropositive dogs, 27.4% displayed clinical signs suggestive of CVBDs, such as cutaneous lesions, enlarged lymph nodes, pale mucous membranes, onychogryphosis and weight loss. The overall seroprevalence detected using the rapid tests was 15.3% for Leishmania spp., whereas 2.3% of the examined dogs were found to be positive for Anaplasma spp. and 7.5% for Ehrlichia spp. while B. burgdorferi was not detected. Twenty-four samples positive to A. phagocytophilum by ELISA were analysed by PCR for the presence of Anaplasma DNA. PCR and sequencing results showed the presence of A. platys DNA in 4 samples and E. canis DNA in 4 samples. The remaining samples (66.7%) were negative. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, exposure of dogs to VBPs was shown in the geographical areas investigated. Results confirm that on Greek islands VBPs represent a constant health risk for both native and visiting dogs, suggesting the presence of distinct “hot-spots” of VBP infections on different islands. In order to reduce the risk of transmission and the spread to non-endemic regions, the protection of dogs through use of repellents and vaccines, together with owner education, seem to be of paramount importance.

36636,Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Early Childhood Care and Education,2020-07-13,"BACKGROUND: Effective and routine mouth care is necessary for hospitalized patients as it helps to maintain the health of oral cavity and overall health. However, oral care is often overlooked and not prioritized in daily activity plan of nurses even when oral problems are apparent. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess nurses’ attitude towards oral care and their practicing level for hospitalized patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was conducted in adult medical-surgical department of Orotta hospital from December 2017 to January 2018. Data was collected from all (N = 73) diploma and associate nurses through face to face interview using a pretested and structured questionnaire. Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U tests and spearman rank correlation coefficient tools were performed to analyze the data using SPSS (Version 22). RESULTS: Out of the 79 participants, 73 completed the interview successfully with a response rate of 92.4%. Of the total, 56.2% were diploma nurses and 43.9% were associate nurses. The median attitude score was 68.89/100 (IQR = 48.89). The majority (94.5%) of the nurses agreed that oral cavity assessment is nurse’s responsibility and 94.5% reported adequate training is needed to provide quality oral care. On the other hand, the median practice score was 50.00/100 (IQR = 17.86). Majority of the participants (76.7%) did not perform routine oral health assessment. Almost all (98.4%) used gauze and normal saline for oral care. Practice score was significantly different across the various wards (p < 0.001), however, it was not significantly correlated with attitude (p = 0.646). CONCLUSIONS: The participants had poor level of oral care practice to hospitalized patients, nevertheless, they had favourable attitude. Therefore, Orotta National Referral Hospital needs to give further effort to train the nursing staff, ensure the availability of adequate oral care equipment and provide clear guidelines regarding oral care of hospitalized patients.","Dagnew, Zewdi Amanuel; Abraham, Isayas Afewerki; Beraki, Ghirmay Ghebreigziabher; Tesfamariam, Eyasu Habte; Mittler, Sibyl; Tesfamichael, Yobiel Zemhret",BMC Nurs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7348104/,110

Many hospitalized patients were treated with therapies that could be administered in a home setting under proper monitoring. We designed the CROWN Program, a Home-Care based ambulatory protocol to evaluate, monitor, and treat moderate to high risk COVID-19 patients in their homes, with escalation to hospital care when necessary. Patients were evaluated with telehealth visits with a Pulmonologist, and a Home-Care protocol, including RN visit, pulse-oximetry, and oxygen, lab-work, intravenous fluids, medication if needed patient data, comorbidities, and symptoms were collected. Labs, including COVID-19 PCR, D Dimer, CRP, Ferritin, Procalcitonin, CBC, and metabolic panel were measured, as were homecare, home oxygen, and intravenous fluids orders, radiographic studies and initiation of an anticoagulant. Emergency Department visits and need for hospital admission during the study period were recorded. A total of 182 patients were enrolled between the start date of April 27th and June 1st, and fell into two categories: not-admitted (101) and post-discharge (81). Two patients were referred for hospital admission, seven were treated and released from the ED, and one was referred to home hospice. There were no unexpected admissions or deaths.

42883,Informal urbanism in the state of uncertainty: forms of informality and urban health emergencies,2020-12-07,"Computing path queries such as the shortest path in public transport networks is challenging because the path costs between nodes change over time. A reachability query from a node at a given start time on such a network retrieves all points of interest (POIs) that are reachable within a given cost budget. Reachability queries are essential building blocks in many applications, for example, group recommendations, ranking spatial queries, or geomarketing. We propose an efficient solution for reachability queries in public transport networks. Currently, there are two options to solve reachability queries. (1) Execute a modified version of Dijkstra’s algorithm that supports time-dependent edge traversal costs; this solution is slow since it must expand edge by edge and does not use an index. (2) Issue a separate path query for each single POI, i.e., a single reachability query requires answering many path queries. None of these solutions scales to large networks with many POIs. We propose a novel and lightweight reachability index. The key idea is to partition the network into cells. Then, in contrast to other approaches, we expand the network cell by cell. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world networks confirm the efficiency and the effectiveness of our index-based reachability query solution.","Tesfaye, Bezaye; Augsten, Nikolaus; Pawlik, Mateusz; Böhlen, Michael H.; Jensen, Christian S.",Advances in Databases and Information Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7703798/,110

45260,Whose child is this?: uncovering a Lasallian anthropology of relational belonging and its implications for educating toward the human flourishing of children in faith,2021-01-30,"Background Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Viral organisms have been identified as the causal pathogen in approximately 20% of CAP. Nutritional status plays an important role in the response to pneumonia. This study aims to identify whether protein energy malnutrition (PEM) is an independent risk factor for mortality and morbidity in viral CAP. Materials and methods This was a retrospective cohort study involving adult hospitalizations for viral CAP in the United States using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. This cohort was further divided based on the presence or absence of a secondary discharge diagnosis of PEM. The primary outcome was inpatient mortality. Secondary outcomes included the rate of mechanical ventilation among other complications. Results The in-hospital mortality for viral CAP was 2.22%. Patients with PEM had over two-fold high adjusted odds of inpatient mortality (aOR: 2.42, 95% CI: 1.746-3.351, p < 0.001) compared with patients without PEM. Patients with PEM had higher adjusted odds of having septic shock (aOR: 3.34, 95% CI: 2.158-5.160, p < 0.001). NSTEMI (aOR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.163-2.621, p = 0.007), need for mechanical ventilation (aOR: 3.13, 95% CI: 2.448-4.006, p < 0.001), CVA (aOR: 3.49, 95% CI: 1.687-7.220, p = 0.001), DVT (aOR: 2.19, 95% CI: 1.453-3.295, p < 0.001), and PE (aOR: 2.24, 95% CI: 1.152-4.357, p = 0.017) relative to patients without PEM. Conclusion In conclusion, coexisting PEM is associated with a higher rate of in-hospital morbidity and mortality in patients with viral CAP. Early identification and treatment of nutritional deficiencies can lead to improved outcomes and reduced costs.","Trelles-Garcia, Valeria P; Trelles-Garcia, Daniela; Kichloo, Asim; Raghavan, Sairam; Ojemolon, Pius E; Eseaton, Precious; Idolor, Osahon N",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7834525/,110

Institutional participants in the asset management market, can play as medium-term funding sources. Their interest in infrastructure projects, as revealed by the study, is associated with the fact that such projects have long-term, stable profitability, although not the highest in the investment market. The authors analyzed the experience of investing in infrastructure projects by non-state pension funds. The analyses of institutional investments in infrastructure projects confirmed that institutional investors, NPFs in particular, have enormous resources and are successful investors. Creation and support of non-State pension provision is a form of business social responsibility expression. The system ensures participation of the State, as well as of the employer and the citizen, in the development of a decent standard of living, thus affecting the organization and implementation of effective social protection for pensioners.","Valishina, M.

While international migration features a high potential for both migrants and their new city of residence, it also generates a series of challenges, whose management falls mainly in the hands of mayors. As the chapter will highlight, city diplomacy offers tools to support this task, primarily in the framework of city networks and partnerships with international organizations. Nevertheless, political differences in addressing migration between cities and central governments have sometimes led to harsh political confrontations. Like in the case of environmental politics, international coalitions of mayors have formed to advocate for a more substantial role of cities in this component of global governance. The final part of the chapter will deal with the impact of COVID-19 on migration and social inclusion, and how cities have been cooperating to address it.","Kihlgren Grandi, Lorenzo",City Diplomacy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971641/,110

The rapid outburst of the COVID-19 virus led to a situation that the government had to shut down all the schools and universities and all the teaching activities had to be carried out without physical contact. The universities had one weekend to conduct the transition. The influence of the rapid change in teaching practice was analysed using the feedback of the study program directors, students and academic staff. The main enablers and disablers with the main constraints are presented. Analysis showed that the transition is impeded both by the lack of technological solutions (i.e. remote usage of laboratories) and by human resources (i.e. skills and willingness to conduct the transition by the academic staff). The unique and hopefully non-recurrent situation enables to analyse both the institutional, technological and personal readiness to adapt with the rapid changes in teaching practice. The outcomes of the experience will be used to improve the readiness and competences at all levels at TalTech.","Annus, Ivar",Educating Engineers for Future Industrial Revolutions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972158/,110

However, within the hematology population, recipients of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) appear to have the greatest risk. In this latter group, some viral infections are more phase-dependent, whereas other infections may be encountered in all transplant phases. For instance, infections with adenovirus and respiratory viruses are diagnosed in all phases after HCT, whereas manifestations of herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 are mostly seen during the pre-engraftment period, infections due to cytomegalovirus and human herpes virus-6 in the early post-engraftment phase, and infections by Epstein–Barr virus and varicella-zoster virus often after day 100 post-transplant.","Maertens, Johan A.; Ráčil, Zdeněk",Infection Management in Hematology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980922/,110

The state-of-the-art proof system that allows for compact proof certificates is propagation redundancy (PR). However, the only existing method to validate proofs in this system with a formally verified tool requires a transformation to a weaker proof system, which can result in a significant blowup in the size of the proof and increased proof validation time. This paper describes the first approach to formally verify PR proofs on a succinct representation; we present (i) a new Linear PR (LPR) proof format, (ii) a tool to efficiently convert PR proofs into LPR format, and (iii) cake_lpr, a verified LPR proof checker developed in CakeML. The LPR format is backwards compatible with the existing LRAT format, but extends the latter with support for the addition of PR clauses. Moreover, cake_lpr is verified using CakeML ’s binary code extraction toolchain, which yields correctness guarantees for its machine code (binary) implementation. This further distinguishes our clausal proof checker from existing ones because unverified extraction and compilation tools are removed from its trusted computing base. We experimentally show that LPR provides efficiency gains over existing proof formats and that the strong correctness guarantees are obtained without significant sacrifice in the performance of the verified executable.","Tan, Yong Kiam; Heule, Marijn J.

Pressures on business leaders from increased competition, environmental awareness, commitment to social purpose, and speed and spread of data communications have been made possible by computerisation and automation which have reached increased dominion during the COVID-19 pandemic. These pressures have created enormous challenges for organizational sustainability and survival. Competition to maintain market prominence and profitability and an excellent environmental awareness reputation has induced some leaders to resort to toxic behavior which has spread to employees driven to achieve specific organizational goals. For example, the unbalanced pursuit by leaders of Volkswagen and Boeing to maintain profits and market leadership resulted in a toxic climate that led to illicit employee behavior and affected their mental health, and the extreme purpose orientation of leadership of the Boy Shop promoted unsustainable employee practices arising from the singular and fixated pursuit of a strategic goal. Digital technology also has eroded employee leisure activity and privacy to the extent that many are on duty 24/7. Employee burnout and mental illness have also been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic through employee isolation and the increasing dependence on technology. The purpose of the paper is to present eclectic examples of toxic behavior and its effects on organizational sustainability. The commentary indicates HRM’s role in identifying and remedying destructive effects of toxic leadership before they take root in a post-COVID-19 world.","Coldwell, David A.

METHOD: The IDENTIFY study was an international, prospective, multicentre cohort study of over 11,000 patients referred to secondary care for investigation of haematuria. Using this data, we developed strategies using combinations of imaging and cytology as triage tests to maximise cancer detection within a pragmatic pathway. RESULTS: 8112 patients (74·4%) received an ultrasound or a CT urogram, with or without cytology. 5737 (70·7%) patients had visible haematuria (VH) and 2375 (29·3%) had non-visible haematuria (NVH). Diagnostic test performance was used to determine optimal age cut-offs for four proposed strategies. We recommended proceeding directly to transurethral resection of bladder tumour for patients of any age with positive triage tests for cancer. Patients with negative triage tests under 35-years-old with VH, or under 50-years-old with NVH can safely be discharged without undergoing flexible cystoscopy. The remaining patients may undergo flexible cystoscopy, with a greater priority for older patients to capture high risk bladder cancer.

53525,The Impact of Acculturation on the Leadership Style of Afghan American Registered Nurses Working in the United States’ Healthcare System,2021-05-26,"FUNDING ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Type of funding sources: None. INTRODUCTION: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs are established interventions to improve cardiovascular health, despite asymmetries in referral. With covid 19 outbreak, cardiac rehabilitation home based (CR-HB) programs emerged as an alternative. However, its adherence and implementation may vary greatly with socio-demographic factors. PURPOSE: To assess adherence to the various components of a CR-HB program. METHODS: Prospective cohort study which included patients (pts) who were participating in a centre-based CR program and accepted to participate in a CR-HB after the centre-based CR program closure due to COVID-19. The CR-HB consisted in a multidisciplinary digital CR program, including: 1.patient clinical and exercise risk assessment; 2.psychological tele-appointments; 3. online exercise training sessions; 4.structured online educational program for patients and family members/caregivers; 5. follow-up questionnaires; 6. nutrition tele-appointments; 7. physician tele-appointments ADHERENCE TO THE PROGRAM WAS ASSESSED BY: drop-out rate; number of exercise sessions in which each patient participated; number of educational sessions attended and a validated questionnaire on therapeutic adherence (composed of 7 questions with minimum punctuation of 7 and maximum of 40 points). RESULTS: 116 cardiovascular disease (CVD) pts (62.6 ± 8.9 years, 95 males) who were attending a Centre-based CR program were included in a CR-HB program. Almost 90% (n = 103) of the participants had coronary artery disease; 13.8% pts had heart failure; the mean LVEF was 52 ± 11%. Regarding risk factors, obesity was the most common risk factor (74.7 %) followed by hypertension (59.6%), family history (41.8%), dyslipidaemia (37.9%), diabetes (18.1%), and smoking (12.9%). Ninety-eight pts (85.5%) successfully completed the program. Almost half (46.9%) of the participants did at least one online exercise training session per week. Among the pts who did online exercise training sessions, 58% did 2-3 times per week, 27% once per week and 15% more than 4 times per week. The pts participated, on average, in 1.45 ± 2.6 education sessions (rate of participation of 13,2%) and therapeutic adherence was high (39,7 ± 19; min 35-40). Regarding educational status of the pts, 33 pts (45,2%) had a bachelor degree. These pts tended to participate more in exercise sessions (1,7 ± 1,7 vs 1,2 ± 1,4 sessions per week) and in education sessions (2.13 vs 1.6), although this difference was not statistically significant. The therapeutic adherence did not vary with patients’ level of education. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that a high percentage of patients completed the program and almost half were weekly physically active. However, in regard to educational sessions, the degree of participation was much lower. Educational status seemed to correlate with a higher degree of participation and, in the future, patient selection might offer better results in these kinds of programs.","Alves Da Silva, P; Aguiar-Ricardo, I; Cunha, N; Rodrigues, T; Valente-Silva, B; Silverio-Antonio, P; Couto-Pereira, S; Brito, J; Pinto, R; Lemos-Pires, M; Borges, M; Cordeiro-Ferreira, M; Caldeira, E; Pinto, FJ; Abreu, A",Eur J Prev Cardiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8136070/,110
54439,HEALTH: Coronavirus,2021-05-24,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 was declared a worldwide pandemic in March of 2020. Since its onset, the focus of many healthcare systems shifted toward limiting non-essential visits to hospitals in order to prioritize and allocate resources toward treating those affected by COVID-19. Those with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) have been particularly impacted. We aimed to survey IBD patients to determine how they have been affected by changes to the provision of care due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A mixed methods survey was conducted with patients with an IBD diagnosis who received care for their IBD since March 17, 2019 in Canada. The primary aims of the survey were to evaluate any differences in access to or usage of IBD-related care including medications, clinic visits in addition to patient experience with virtual care. RESULTS: A total of 135 complete or partial responses were received, of which 90 responses were included for having answered >50% of questions. The majority of respondents were from Ontario, with a mean age of 42 years, and over 75% being female. 67% had Crohn’s Disease, and 69% were on a biologic. Three percent of respondents stopped taking all IBD-related medications without the advice of their gastroenterologist due to pandemic-related concerns while 8% reported difficulty obtaining their medications. Thirty-eight percent reported a delay in being able to see their gastroenterologist, with a majority reporting a delay >4 weeks (n=21). Twenty-three percent required a visit to the emergency department due to IBD-related concerns, and 13% of participants were admitted to hospital. 33% reported a delay in endoscopy, with a majority reporting a delay greater than 3 months (n=17). Thirty-eight percent reported receiving poorer care since the pandemic began, while 36% reported no change. 76% of respondents used Telehealth for their appointments. 66% reported they were able to speak with their gastroenterologist within 15 minutes of their appointment time. Thirty percent preferred telehealth appointments to in-person visits. Half reported no change with their quality of interaction with their gastroenterologists. CONCLUSION: Preliminary data highlight that patients have experienced significant delays in IBD care during the COVID-19 pandemic, with more than one third reporting a reduction in the quality of that care. Interestingly, only a minority of patients stopped medication or had reduced access during the pandemic. Further studies will help define whether there were a significant change in the number of hospitalizations due to this delay. Virtual care is a useful tool during the pandemic, but its mixed feedback raises questions about how it can be effectively utilized in the future.","Malhi, G; Mikail, M0; Chambers, J; Khanna, R; Wilson, A",J Crohns Colitis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8195062/,110

55180,Social Work under COVID-19: A Thematic Analysis of Articles in ‘SW2020 under COVID-19 Magazine’,2021-05-20,"SARS‐CoV‐2 has become an increasingly dangerous virus infecting 77.6 million people and resulting in over 2 million deaths in the last year. The spike glycoprotein plays an important role in the viral infection process by recognizing and binding to the ACE2 receptor in host's cells. Due to the importance of this protein, current research efforts are focused on mutations that impact viral infectivity. SARS‐CoV‐2 viruses with a spike mutation at position 614 were recently shown to be more infectious than their wild‐type ancestor. The D614G substitution eliminates a hydrogen bond with a threonine residue (T859) in an adjacent protein chain, allowing the spike protein to assume more readily an open conformation. Since the open conformation mediates attachment to the ACE2 receptor, the D614G mutant causes higher infectivity than the wild‐type spike protein. The main goal of this research was to create physical 3D printed models of the wild‐type and mutant spike proteins to visualize the molecular changes caused by the D614G mutation. Structural analyses of the wild‐type and the D614G spike mutant were performed using the Protein Data Bank files, 6vxx and 6xs6. To visualize the conformational changes caused by the D614G mutation, the protein structure alignments were performed using Pymol. A combined file containing the superimposed structures was imported into Jmol to create the scripts for model construction and 3D printing. A small protein model was built to describe the overall structure of the spike and the location of the amino acids linked to higher viral infectivity. An additional detailed model was constructed to illustrate the biochemical interactions at the mutation site. In this model, important amino acids such as Asp614, Ala647, and Thr859 are highlighted due to their role in hydrogen bonding and spike protein binding to the ACE2 receptor. A magnetic piece was created to show the effects of the aspartic acid to glycine mutation at position 614. A Jmol tutorial was designed to complement the 3D models and assess students’ learning of the structure and function of SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein. This exercise will allow undergraduate students and faculty to visualize and better understand how single amino acid mutations can lead to changes in viral infectivity.","McDonald, Lauren; Young, Dean; Hill, Patricia; Martinez‐Vaz, Betsy",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239501/,110
55225,Designing international tax reform: lessons from TCJA,2021-06-30,"People with pre‐existing conditions including obesity, diabetes, and kidney disease are at greater risk for complications of COVID‐19, the disease caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Predisposing risk factors could include poor dietary quality and at‐risk alcohol use. Increased survival and aging of people living with HIV (PLWH) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) is complicated by comorbidities including at‐risk alcohol use, metabolic dysregulation, diabetes, and chronic renal disease, with obesity and metabolic syndrome highest in southern states. We hypothesize that poor dietary quality in combination with at‐risk alcohol use may increase risk factors for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in PLWH. To test this hypothesis, biospecimen obtained from a longitudinal study in female rhesus macaques (macaca mulatta) were used to determine whether high‐fat high‐sucrose diet (HFD; protein/fat/carbohydrates 16/42/42% of total kcal and 27% sucrose by weight) and chronic binge alcohol administration (CBA) increased expression of the machinery required for SARS‐CoV‐2 cell entry. Female macaques (n=10) were assigned to HFD or standard chow diet (SD; protein/fat/carbohydrates 29/14/57% of total kcal) and CBA (50‐60 mM peak blood alcohol, 5 days/week) or isovolumetric water (VEH) beginning 3 months before SIV(mac251) infection. ART was initiated at 2.5 months of SIV infection. Tissue samples including lung, pancreas, and kidney were collected at study endpoint (~12 months post‐SIV infection). Immunohistochemistry was performed on formalin‐fixed, paraffin embedded samples to determine protein expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). Images were obtained at 20x magnification and fluorescence intensity was used for quantification. RNA was extracted from frozen samples and mRNA expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was measured by qPCR and quantified relative to ribosomal protein S13. Normality of data was verified and outliers identified using Grubbs test. Data were then analyzed using a 2 (alcohol) × 2 (diet) ANOVA. Protein expression of ACE2 in the lung (p<0.01, η(2)=0.59), whole pancreas (p<0.05, η(2)=0.64), and pancreatic islets (p<0.05, η(2)=0.44) was greater in HFD‐ than SD‐fed macaques and was not significantly altered by CBA. No alcohol‐ or diet‐mediated differences in ACE2 protein expression were observed for whole kidney or proximal tubules. No alcohol‐ or diet‐mediated differences in protein expression of TMPRSS2 or relative mRNA expression of ACE2 or TMPRSS2 were observed. Results indicate that a high‐fat, high‐sucrose diet increases expression of the ACE2 receptor in SIV‐infected female macaques. Because the ACE2 receptor is required for SARS‐CoV‐2 cell entry, this diet‐mediated increase in expression may increase risk for greater vulnerability to COVID‐19 disease and associated complications. These data provide direct evidence for a link between dietary quality and risk for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in the context of SIV/HIV infection, urging diet counseling and increased access to higher‐quality foods in this population.","Levitt, Danielle; Delery, Elizabeth; Simon, Liz; Molina, Patricia",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239657/,110

57030,Segmentation of Older Adults in the Acceptance of Social Networking Sites Using Machine Learning,2021-08-11,"Uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) is one of the most important base excision repair (BER) enzymes involved in the repair of uracil-induced DNA lesion by removing uracil from the damaged DNA. Uracil in DNA may occur due to cytosine deamination or deoxy uridine monophosphate (dUMP) residue misincorporation during DNA synthesis. Medical evidences show that an abnormal expression of UDG is related to different types of cancer, including colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and liver cancer. Therefore, the research of UDG is crucial in cancer treatment and prevention as well as other clinical activities. Here we applied multiple computational methods to study UDG in several perspectives: Understanding the stability of the UDG enzyme in different pH conditions; studying the differences in charge distribution between the pocket side and non-pocket side of UDG; analyzing the field line distribution at the interfacial area between UDG and DNA; and performing electrostatic binding force analyses of the special region of UDG (pocket area) and the target DNA base (uracil) as well as investigating the charged residues on the UDG binding pocket and binding interface. Our results show that the whole UDG binding interface, and not the UDG binding pocket area alone, provides the binding attractive force to the damaged DNA at the uracil base.","Xie, Yixin; Karki, Chitra B.; Chen, Jiawei; Liu, Dongfang; Li, Lin",Front Mol Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8377759/,110

Preclinical testing under standardized conditions is an important first step to evaluate the technical performance and potential of these devices. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immediate recanalization effect, recanalization efficacy, thrombus-device interaction, and safety of a new stent retriever intended for thrombectomy in patients with acute stroke. MATERIAL AND METHODS The pREset thrombectomy device (4 × 20 mm) was evaluated in 16 vessel occlusions in an established swine model. Radiopaque thrombi (10-mm length) were used for visualization of thrombus-device interaction during application and retrieval. Flow-restoration effect immediately after deployment and after 5-minute embedding time before retrieval, recanalization rate after retrieval, thromboembolic events, and complications were assessed. High-resolution FPCT was performed to illustrate thrombus-device interaction during the embedding time. RESULTS Immediate flow restoration was achieved in 75% of occlusions. An increase or stable percentage of recanalizations during embedding time before retrieval was seen in 56.3%; a decrease, in 12.5%; reocclusion of a previously recanalized vessel, in 18.8%; and no recanalization effect at all, in 12.5%. Complete recanalization (TICI 3) after retrieval was achieved in 93.8%; partial recanalization (TICI 2b), in 6.2%. No distal thromboembolic events were observed. High-resolution FPCT illustrated entrapment of the thrombus between the stent struts and compression against the contralateral vessel wall, leading to partial flow restoration. During retrieval, the thrombus was retained in a straight position within the stent struts. CONCLUSIONS In this experimental study, the pREset thrombus retriever showed a high recanalization rate in vivo. High-resolution FPCT allows detailed illustration of the thrombus-device interaction during embedding time and is advocated as an add-on tool to the animal model used in this study.","Mordasini, P; Brekenfeld, C; Byrne, J V; Fischer, U; Arnold, M; Jung, S; Schroth, G; Gralla, J",AJNR.

62388,Self-Defeating Codes of Medical Ethics and How to Fix Them: Failures in COVID-19 Response and Beyond.,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease caused by brucella. It has been an increasing trend in recent years (Wang H, Xu WM, Zhu KJ, Zhu SJ, Zhang HF, Wang J, Yang Y, Shao FY, Jiang NM, Tao ZY, Jin HY, Tang Y, Huo LL, Dong F, Li ZJ, Ding H, Liu ZG, Emerg Microbes Infect 9:889-99, 2020). Brucellosis is capable to invade multiple systems throughout the body, lacking in typical clinical manifestations, and easily misdiagnosed and mistreated. CASE PRESENTATION We report a case of a male, 5-year-and-11-month old child without relevant medical history, who was admitted to hospital for 20 days of fever. When admitted to the hospital, we found that he was enervated, irritable and sleepy, accompanied with red eyes phenomenon. After anti-infection treatment with meropenem, no improvement observed. Lumbar puncture revealed normal CSF protein, normal cells, and negative culture. Later, doppler echocardiography suggested coronary aneurysms, and incomplete Kawasaki Disease with coronary aneurysms was proposed. The next day, brucellosis agglutination test was positive. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of cerebrospinal fluid suggested B.melitensis, which was confirmed again by blood culture. The child was finally diagnosed as brucellosis with meningocephalitis, coronary aneurysm and keratitis. According to our preliminary research and review, such case has never been reported in detail before. After diagnosis confirmation, the child was treated with rifampicin, compound sulfamethoxazole, and ceftriaxone for cocktail anti-infection therapy. Aspirin and dipyridamole were also applied for anticoagulant therapy. After medical treatment, body temperature of the child has reached normal level, eye symptoms alleviated, and mental condition gradually turned normal. Re-examination of the doppler echocardiographic indicated that the coronary aneurysm was aggravated, so warfarin was added for amplification of anticoagulation treatment. At present, 3 months of follow-up, the coronary artery dilatation gradually assuaged, and the condition is continued to alleviate. CONCLUSION Brucellosis can invade nervous system, coronary artery, and cornea. Brucellosis lacks specific signs for clinical diagnosis. The traditional agglutination test and the new mNGS are convenient and effective, which can provide the reference for clinical diagnosis.","Geng, Lingling; Feng, Yuan; Li, Dan; Nan, Nan; Ma, Kai; Tang, Xianyan; Li, Xiaoqing",BMC infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-05358-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894070/,110

63558,Structural Racism in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Don't Forget about the Children!,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND Aspergillus species meet the most important group of invasive fungal diseases (IFD) in immunosuppressed patients. Galactomannan is a polysaccharide antigen located in the wall structure of Aspergillus. The most commonly used method for antigen detection is enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA). Aspergillus galactomannan Lateral Flow Assay (LFA) constitutes one of the new methods in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA). The goal of this study is to demonstrate efficacy of LFA in our patients and to compare it to synchronous ELISA results. METHODS Galactomannan antigen was examined using both LFA and ELISA in serum samples taken from patients who were followed up in our hematology clinic. All patients are classified in subgroups as ""proven"", ""probable"", and ""possible"" patients according to the last EORTC / MSG guideline. Patients who met the ""proven"" IA criteria were included in the study as the gold standard. RESULTS A total of 87 patients were included in the study. Majority of patients had acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (56.3%). Eleven (12.6%) were in ""proven"" IA group. LFA test showed a superior diagnostic performance compared to ELISA (LFAAUC = 0.934 vs ELISAAUC = 0.545; p <0.001). The LFA had a sensitivity of 90.9%, and a specificity of 90.8% for ""0.5 ODI"" in predicting IA (PPV = 55.8%; NPV = 98.6%; p <0.001). CONCLUSION The most important finding of this study is that the specificity of LFA was found to be higher for cut-off value ​​of 0.5. It is recommended to combine the methods in many studies to provide a better early diagnosis for IA.","Serin, Istemi; Hilmi Dogu, Mehmet",Mycoses,https://doi.org/10.1111/myc.13265; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33683715/,110
64609,Pandemic speeds largest test yet of universal basic income.,2020-07-10,"BACKGROUND Decision-making in end-stage dementia (ESD) is a complex process involving medical, social, legal and ethical issues. In ESD, the person suffers from severe cognitive problems leading to a loss of capacity to decide matters regarding health and end-of-life issues. The decisional responsibility is usually passed to clinicians and relatives who can face significant difficulty in making moral decisions, particularly in the presence of life-threatening swallowing problems. AIM This study aimed to understand the decision-making processes of clinical teams and relatives in addressing life-threatening swallowing difficulties in ESD in long-term care in Malta. METHOD The study followed a qualitative approach where six case studies, involving six different teams and relatives of six different patients, were interviewed retrospectively to understand their decision-making in connection with the management of swallowing difficulties in ESD. Data were collected through semistructured interviews with each stakeholder. All data were transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis. RESULTS Four themes were identified: the vulnerability of patients in dementia decision-making; the difficult role of relatives in decision-making; the decisional conflict between aggressive care through tube feeding versus oral comfort feeding; a consensus-building decision-making process as ideal to facilitate agreement and respect for patient's dignity. CONCLUSION Decision-making to manage swallowing difficulties in ESD is a challenging process, which involves an interpretation of personal values, beliefs, patient preferences, care needs and clinical practice. Better communication between clinicians and relatives in dementia helps promote agreement between stakeholders leading to a care plan that respects the dignity of patients at their end of life.","Dimech, Joseph; Agius, Emmanuel; Hughes, Julian C; Bartolo, Paul",Journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-106222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747524/,110

68915,Developments in medical education in response to the COVID-19 pandemic: A rapid BEME systematic review: BEME Guide No. 63.,2020-08-26,"PURPOSE Model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) algorithms such as penalized-likelihood (PL) methods exhibit data-dependent and shift-variant properties. Image quality predictors have been derived to prospectively estimate local noise and spatial resolution, facilitating both system hardware design and tuning of reconstruction methods. However, current MBIR image quality predictors rely on idealized system models, ignoring physical blurring effects and noise correlations found in real systems. In this work, we develop and validate a new set of predictors using a physical system model specific to flat-panel cone-beam CT (FP-CBCT). METHODS Physical models appropriate for integration with MBIR analysis are developed and parameterized to represent nonidealities in FP projection data including focal spot blur, scintillator blur, detector aperture effect, and noise correlations. Flat-panel-specific predictors for local spatial resolution and local noise properties in PL reconstructions are developed based on these realistic physical models. Estimation accuracy of conventional (idealized) and FP-specific predictors is investigated and validated against experimental CBCT measurements using specialized phantoms. RESULTS Validation studies show that flat-panel-specific predictors can accurately estimate the local spatial resolution and noise properties, while conventional predictors show significant deviations in the magnitude and scale of the spatial resolution and local noise. The proposed predictors show accurate estimations over a range of imaging conditions including varying x-ray technique and regularization strength. The conventional spatial resolution prediction is sharper than ground truth. Using conventional spatial resolution predictor, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of local point spread function (PSF) is underestimated by 0.2 mm. This mismatch is mostly eliminated in FP-specific prediction. The general shape and amplitude of local noise power spectrum (NPS) FP-specific predictions are consistent with measurement, while the conventional predictions underestimated the noise level by 70%. CONCLUSION The proposed image quality predictors permit accurate estimation of local spatial resolution and noise properties for PL reconstruction, accounting for dependencies on the system geometry, x-ray technique, and patient-specific anatomy in real FP-CBCT. Such tools enable prospective analysis of image quality for a range of goals including novel system and acquisition design, adaptive and task-driven imaging, and tuning of MBIR for robust and reliable behavior.","Wang, Wenying; Gang, Grace J; Siewerdsen, Jeffrey H; Stayman, J Webster",Medical physics,https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.13249; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30372536/,110

He was noted to have sixth nerve palsy. The following day he was admitted to hospital with confusion and expressive dysphasia. He had been due to travel to Ghana on business and had received yellow fever (YF) vaccination 18 days prior to onset of headaches. His initial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed elevated protein, increased white cell count but was PCR negative for standard viral pathogens. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 was detected by PCR in CSF at a very low level from a second lumbar puncture performed 6 days later, and the patient was treated for HSV meningoencephalitis. However, retrospective investigation for yellow fever vaccine-associated neurological disease revealed increasing titres of YF IgG in three serial CSF samples, and no evidence of HSV antibodies in CSF or plasma, ruling out HSV encephalitis.","Goldstein, Emily J; Bell, David J; Gunson, Rory N",BMJ case reports,https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2019-229558; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088820/,110
71044,Hand hygiene for healthcare workers: did we need COVID-19 to raise awareness of proper disinfection practice?,2021-04-13,"BACKGROUND Monitoring respiratory status using end tidal CO2 (EtCO2), which reliably reflects arterial PaCO2 in intubated patients under general anesthesia, has often proven both inaccurate and inadequate when monitoring non-intubated and spontaneously breathing patients. This is particularly important in patients undergoing procedural sedation (e.g., endoscopy, colonoscopy). This can be undertaken in the operating theater, but is also often delivered outside the operating room by non-anesthesia providers. In this study we evaluated the ability for conventional EtCO2 monitoring to reflect changes in ventilation in non-intubated surgical patients undergoing monitored anesthesia care and compared and contrasted these findings to both intubated patients under general anesthesia and spontaneously breathing volunteers. METHODS Minute Ventilation (MV), tidal volume (TV), and respiratory rate (RR) were continuously collected from an impedance-based Respiratory Volume Monitor (RVM) simultaneously with capnography data in 160 patients from three patient groups: non-intubated surgical patients managed using spinal anesthesia and Procedural Sedation (n = 58); intubated surgical patients under General Anesthesia (n = 54); and spontaneously breathing Awake Volunteers (n = 48). EtCO2 instrument sensitivity was calculated for each patient as the slope of a Deming regression between corresponding measurements of EtCO2 and MV and expressed as angle from the x-axis (θ). All data are presented as mean ± SD unless otherwise indicated. RESULTS While, as expected, EtCO2 and MV measurements were negatively correlated in most patients, we found gross systematic differences across the three cohorts. In the General Anesthesia patients, small changes in MV resulted in large changes in EtCO2 (high sensitivity, θ = -83.6 ± 9.9°). In contrast, in the Awake Volunteers patients, large changes in MV resulted in insignificant changes in EtCO2 (low sensitivity, θ = -24.7 ± 19.7°, p < 0.0001 vs General Anesthesia). In the Procedural Sedation patients, EtCO2 sensitivity showed a bimodal distribution, with an approximately even split between patients showing high EtCO2 instrument sensitivity, similar to those under General Anesthesia, and patients with low EtCO2 instrument sensitivity, similar to the Awake Volunteers. CONCLUSIONS When monitoring non-intubated patients undergoing procedural sedation, EtCO2 often provides inadequate instrument sensitivity when detecting changes in ventilation. This suggests that augmenting standard patient care with EtCO2 monitoring is a less than optimal solution for detecting changes in respiratory status in non-intubated patients. Instead, adding direct monitoring of MV with an RVM may be preferable for continuous assessment of adequacy of ventilation in non-intubated patients.","Mehta, Jaideep H; Williams, George W; Harvey, Brian C; Grewal, Navneet K; George, Edward E",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0180187; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28662195/,110
71127,The Inherent Unfairness of COVID-19 Drug Access Pathways.,2020,"BACKGROUND Primary central nervous system diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (PCNS-DLBCL) is a relatively rare and aggressive neoplasm. High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is an effective regimen for the treatment of PCNS-DLBCL, but MTX-related toxicity remains a problem. The aim of this analysis study was to investigate the influence of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene C677T polymorphism on HD-MTX-related toxicity in patients with PCNS-DLBCL. MATERIAL/METHODS A prospective, observational study was conducted to analyze 148 MTX courses in 32 patients with PCNS-DLBCL. RESULTS The delayed MTX clearance was observed in 53 cycles (35.8%). The patients carrying the homozygous variant genotype had a higher risk of developing nephrotoxicity than those carrying the wild-type genotype (odds ratio [OR] 13.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.65-103.86; P = .002) or heterozygous variant genotype (OR 8.43; 95% CI, 2.31-30.70; P < .001). Significant differences were observed in hepatotoxicity (OR 9.33; 95% CI, 2.54-34.27; P < .001) and hematologic toxicity (OR 3.09; 95% CI, 1.18-8.07; P = .024) in addition to nephrotoxicity between the homozygous variant genotype and the wild-type genotype. CONCLUSION The homozygous mutation of C to T at nucleotide 677 increases the risk on HD-MTX-related toxicity. The MTHFR C677T polymorphism can be used to predict HD-MTX-related toxicity for patients with PCNS-DLBCL.","Chang, Xiaoli; Guo, Yixian; Su, Li; Zhang, Yunxiu; Hui, Wuhan; Zhao, Hong; Hu, Ronghua; Sun, Wanling","Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clml.2020.08.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069634/,110
73163,Virtual Multiple Mini-Interview during a COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-05-04,"Esophageal cancer (EC) is a leading cause of cancer morbidity and mortality in Africa. Despite the high burden of disease, optimal management strategies for EC in resource-constrained settings have yet to be established. This systematic review evaluates the literature on treatments for EC throughout Africa, and compares the efficacy and safety of varying treatment strategies in this context (PROSPERO CRD42017071546). Pubmed, Embase, and African Index Medicus were searched for studies published on treatment strategies for EC in Africa from 1980-2020. Searches were supplemented by examining bibliographies of included studies and relevant conference proceedings. Methodological quality/risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Forty-six studies were included. Case series constituted the majority of studies: thirteen were case series reporting on outcomes of esophagectomies, 17 on palliative luminal or surgical interventions, four on radiotherapy and three on concurrent chemoradiation. Nine randomized-controlled trials were identified, of which four prospectively compared different treatment modalities (one investigating radiotherapy vs. chemoradiation, three evaluating rigid plastic stents vs. other treatments). This review summarizes the research on EC treatments in Africa published over the last four decades and outlines critical gaps in knowledge related to management in this context. Areas in need of further research include: (i) evaluation of the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy in patients with locally advanced disease; (ii) strategies to improve long-term survival in patients treated with definitive chemoradiation; and (iii) the comparative effectiveness of modern palliative interventions, focusing on quality of life and survival as outcome measures.

This opportunistic pathogen asymptomatically colonizes the mucosal epithelium of the upper respiratory tract, from where it spreads to other neighboring regions, potentially leading to disease. Infection with NTHi can cause otitis media, sinusitis, conjunctivitis, exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia, but is increasingly causing invasive disease including bacteremia and meningitis. Invasive NTHi strains are more resistant to complement-mediated killing. However, the mechanisms of complement resistance have never been studied in large numbers of invasive NTHi strains.In this study, we determined the relationship between binding of IgG or IgM and the bacterial survival in normal human serum for 267 invasive H. influenzae strains from Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands, of which the majority (200, 75%), were NTHi.NTHi bacteria opsonized with high levels of IgM had the lowest survival in human serum. IgM binding to the bacterial surface, but not IgG binding, was shown to be associated with complement-mediated killing of NTHi strains. We conclude that evasion of IgM binding by NTHi strains increases survival in blood, thereby potentially contributing to their ability to cause severe invasive diseases.","Dudukina, Elena; de Smit, Laura; Verhagen, Giel J A; van de Ende, Arie; Marimón, José María; Bajanca-Lavado, Paula; Ardanuy, Carmen; Marti, Sara; de Jonge, Marien I; Langereis, Jeroen D",Infection and immunity,https://doi.org/10.1128/iai.00454-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719154/,110

The overall stalled progress in the HIV response has been further undermined by rising new infections among young key populations and the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. This paper examines the HIV situation, assesses the gaps, and analyses what it would take the region to end AIDS by 2030. Political will and commitments for ending AIDS must be reaffirmed and reinforced. Focused regional strategic direction that answers the specific regional context and guides countries to respond to their specific needs must be put in place. The region must harness the power of innovative tools and technology in both prevention and treatment. Community activism and meaningful community engagement across the spectrum of HIV response must be ensured. Punitive laws, stigma, and discrimination that deter key populations and people living with HIV from accessing health services must be effectively tackled. The people-centred public health approach must be fully integrated into national universal health coverage while ensuring domestic resources are available for community-led service delivery.

There is no evidence suggesting that wide margin excisions decrease intra-breast tumour recurrence. Various perioperative techniques are used for margin assessment. We aimed to compare three commonly used techniques, i.e., Ultrasound-guided surgery, palpation-guided surgery and cavity shaving for attaining negative margins and estimating the extent of healthy breast tissue resection. METHOD A prospective comparative study was performed on 90 patients who underwent breast conservation surgery for early breast cancer between August 2018 and June 2019. Tumour excision with a minimum of 1 cm margin was done either using ultrasound, palpation or cavity shaving. Histopathological evaluation was done to assess the margin status and excess amount of resected normal breast tissue. Calculated resection ratio (CRR) defining the excess amount of the resected breast tissue was achieved by dividing the total resection volume (TRV) by optimal resection volume (ORV). The time taken for excision was also recorded. RESULTS Histopathology of all 90 patients (30 in each group) revealed a negative resection margin in 93.3% of 30 patients in palpation-guided surgery group and 100% in both Ultrasound-guided surgery and cavity shaving groups. Two patients (6.7%) from the cavity shaving group had positive margins on initial lumpectomy but shave margins were negative. TRV was significantly less in the Ultrasound-guided surgery group compared to the palpation-guided surgery group and cavity shaving group (76.9 cm3, 94.7 cm3 and 126.3 cm3 respectively; p < 0.0051). CRR was 1.2 in ultrasound group compared to 1.9 in palpation group and 2.1 in cavity shave group which was also statistically significant (p < 0.0001).Excision time was significantly less (p < 0.001) in palpation-guided surgery group (13.8 min) compared to cavity shaving group (15.1 min) and Ultrasound-guided group (19.4 min). CONCLUSION Ultrasound-guided surgery is more accurate in attaining negative margins with the removal of least amount of healthy breast tissue compared to palpation-guided surgery and cavity shaving.","Krishna, Kanyadhara Lohita; Srinath, B S; Santosh, Divya; Velusamy, Shanthi; Divyamala, V; Sariya Mohammadi, J; Kurpad, Vishnu; Kulkarni, Sanjeev; Yaji, Prabhat; Goud, Sandeep; Dhanireddy, Subhashini; Ram, Janaki",Breast disease,https://doi.org/10.3233/bd-200443; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831188/,110

Self-determination theory has been reviewed but without assessing both benefits and harms and accounting for the risk of random errors using trial sequential analysis. The guided self-determination has not yet been systematically reviewed. The aim of this protocol is to investigate the benefits and harms of self-determination theory-based interventions versus usual care in adults with diabetes. METHODS/DESIGN We will conduct the systematic review following The Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. This protocol is reported according to the PRISMA checklist. A comprehensive search will be undertaken in the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, PsycINFO, SCI-EXPANDED, CINAHL, SSCI, CPCI-S and CPCI-SSH to identify relevant trials. We will include randomised clinical trials assessing interventions theoretically based on guided self-determination or self-determination theory provided face-to-face or digitally by any healthcare professional in any setting. The primary outcomes will be quality of life, mortality, and serious adverse events. The secondary will be diabetes distress, depressive symptoms and adverse events not considered serious. Exploratory outcomes will be glycated haemoglobin and motivation. Outcomes will be assessed at the end of the intervention and at maximum follow-up. The analyses will be performed using Stata version 16 and trial sequential analysis. Two authors will independently screen, extract data from and perform risk of bias assessment of included studies using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Certainty of the evidence will be assessed by GRADE. DISCUSSION Self-determination theory interventions aim to promote a more autonomous patient engagement and are commonly used. It is therefore needed to evaluate the benefit and harms according to existing trials.

80745,Covid-19: how coronavirus will change the face of general practice forever.,2020-03-30,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic adult hernia repair has the clinical advantage of allowing the surgeon to explore asymptomatic contralateral inguinal hernia. We conduct a retrospective study to compare the occurrence of contralateral metachronous inguinal hernia (CMIH) after laparoscopic total extraperitoneal (TEP) repair with or without contralateral exploration. METHODS One hundred and fifty-one consecutive patients undergoing unilateral laparoscopic TEP repair during November 2007 to November 2012 were enrolled into groups with contralateral or no contralateral exploration. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors were recorded then reviewed for analysis. The primary end-point was the occurrence of contralateral inguinal hernia. The patients were regularly interviewed postoperatively at outpatient clinics. RESULTS Finally, 68 patients in the exploration group and 46 in the non-exploration group were eligible for analysis. All demographic data, except age, was comparable between the two groups. Twenty-three of 68 (33.8%) in the exploration cohort had at least one occult contralateral inguinal hernia detected and repaired at the time of primary repair. In contrast to the high incidence (6/46, 13%) of CMIH in the non-exploration cohort, there was only one metachronous occurrence (1/68, 1.4%) after negative contralateral exploration at a median follow-up of longer than 3 yrs (p = 0.02). The peri-operative results were comparable between groups regarding operative time, analgesic requirements, complications, and chronic pain. CONCLUSIONS Simultaneous exploration and repair of the incidental defects on the contralateral inguinal region during laparoscopic TEP repair of unilateral inguinal hernia is recommended in selected patients based on its high safety and clinical effectiveness in preventing later CMIH.","Wu, Chao-Chuan; Chueh, Shih-Chieh; Tsai, Yao-Chou",International journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2016.10.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27743897/,110

Clinical trials were planned and are in progress to investigate whether drugs used for influenza, HIV and other viruses, and also anthelmintics (ivermectin, nitazoxanide, niclosamide), and antimalarials (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine) showing antiviral activity in in vitro assays, are effective and safe for Covid-19. So far there is no convincing evidence that these antiviral and antiparasitic drugs are of any benefit for Covid-19. Notwithsanding the absence of evidence of clinical efficacy, these drugs are widely used outside of clinical trials (off label) for prophylaxis and treatment of this viral infection. The rationale behind the prescription of macrolide antibiotics (azithromycin) for Covid-19 is obscure as well. The widespread prescription and use of drugs of unproven efficacy and safety for Covid-19 is at odds with the rational use of medicines, a cornerstone principle of pharmacotherapy advanced by WHO in 1985. This irrational use of drugs is cause for concern because some of them are associated with serious heart disorders and deaths.","Paumgartten, Francisco José Roma; Oliveira, Ana Cecilia Amado Xavier de",Ciencia & saude coletiva,https://doi.org/10.1590/1413-81232020259.16792020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32876249/,110

84724,[Covid-19 in the Northeast of Brazil: from lockdown to the relaxation of social distancing measures].,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND Human cerebral organoids (hCO) are attractive systems due to their ability to model important brain regions and transcriptomics of early in vivo brain development. To date, they have been used to understand the effects of genetics and soluble factors on neurodevelopment. Interestingly, one of the main advantages of hCOs are that they provide three dimensionality that better mimics the in vivo environment; yet, despite this central feature it remains unclear how spatial and mechanical properties regulate hCO and neurodevelopment. While biophysical factors such as shape and mechanical forces are known to play crucial roles in stem cell differentiation, embryogenesis and neurodevelopment, much of this work investigated two dimensional systems or relied on correlative observations of native developing tissues in three dimensions. Using hCOs to establish links between spatial factors and neurodevelopment will require the use of new approaches and could reveal fundamental principles of brain organogenesis as well as improve hCOs as an experimental model. RESULTS Here, we investigated the effects of early geometric confinements on transcriptomic changes during hCO differentiation. Using a custom and tunable agarose microwell platform we generated embryoid bodies (EB) of diverse shapes mimicking several structures from embryogenesis and neurodevelopment and then further differentiated those EBs to whole brain hCOs. Our results showed that the microwells did not have negative gross impacts on the ability of the hCOs to differentiate towards neural fates, and there were clear shape dependent effects on neural lineage specification. In particular we observed that non-spherical shapes showed signs of altered neurodevelopmental kinetics and favored the development of medial ganglionic eminence-associated brain regions and cell types over cortical regions. Transcriptomic analysis suggests these mechanotransducive effects may be mediated by integrin and Wnt signaling. CONCLUSIONS The findings presented here suggest a role for spatial factors in brain region specification during hCO development. Understanding these spatial patterning factors will not only improve understanding of in vivo development and differentiation, but also provide important handles with which to advance and improve control over human model systems for in vitro applications.","Sen, Dilara; Voulgaropoulos, Alexis; Keung, Albert J",BMC biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12896-021-00718-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34641840/,110

PURPOSE The purpose of the study was to evaluate the performance of CT in differentiating COVID-19 from other viral infections using a standardized reporting classification. METHODS A total of 175 consecutive patients were retrospectively identified from a single tertiary-care medical center from March 15 to March 24, 2020, including 87 with positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for COVID-19 and 88 with negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test, but positive respiratory pathogen panel. Two thoracic radiologists, who were blinded to RT-PCR and respiratory pathogen panel results, reviewed chest CT images independently and classified the imaging findings under 4 categories: ""typical"" appearance, ""indeterminate,"" ""atypical,"" and ""negative"" for pneumonia. The final classification was based on consensus between the readers. RESULTS Patients with COVID-19 were older than patients with other viral infections (P=0.038). The inter-rater agreement of CT categories between the readers ranged from good to excellent, κ=0.80 (0.73 to 0.87). Final CT categories were statistically different among COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups (P<0.001). CT ""typical"" appearance was more prevalent in the COVID-19 group (64/87, 73.6%) than in the non-COVID-19 group (2/88, 2.3%). When considering CT ""typical"" appearance as a positive test, a sensitivity of 73.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 63%-82.4%), specificity of 97.7% (95% CI: 92%-99.7%), positive predictive value of 97% (95% CI: 89.5%-99.6%), and negative predictive value of 78.9% (95% CI: 70%-86.1%) were observed. CONCLUSION The standardized chest CT classification demonstrated high specificity and positive predictive value in differentiating COVID-19 from other viral infections when presenting a ""typical"" appearance in a high pretest probability environment. Good to excellent inter-rater agreement was found regarding the CT standardized categories between the readers.","Borges da Silva Teles, Gustavo; Kaiser Uruhary Nunes Fonseca, Eduardo; Yokoo, Patricia; Marques Almeida Silva, Murilo; Yanata, Elaine; Shoji, Hamilton; Bastos Duarte Passos, Rodrigo; Caruso Chate, Rodrigo; Szarf, Gilberto",Journal of thoracic imaging,https://doi.org/10.1097/rti.0000000000000563; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33003105/,110

86816,"The Regulation of COVID-19 ""Challenge"" Studies.",2020-07-01,"Various asymptotic methods of obtaining a confidence interval (CI) for the odds ratio (OR) have been proposed. Surprisingly, insofar as we know, the behavior of these methods has not been evaluated for data proceeding from a cross-sectional study (multinomial sampling), but only for data that originate in a prospective or retrospective study (two independent binomials sampling). The paper evaluates 15 different methods (10 classic ones and 5 new ones). Because the CI is obtained by inversion in θ of the two-tailed test for H0(θ): OR =[Formula: see text] (null hypothesis), this paper evaluates the tests for various values of θ, more than the CIs that are obtained. The following statements are valid only for the two-tailed inferences based on 20 ≤ n ≤ 200 and 0.05≤ OR≤20, since these are the limitations of the study. The two best methods are the classic Cornfield chi-squared method for 0.2≤ OR≤5 and, in other cases, the new method of Sterne for chi-squared; but the adjusted likelihood ratio method is a good alternative to the two previous methods, especially to the first when the sample size is large. The three methods require iterative calculations to obtain the CI. If one is looking for methods that are simple to apply (that is, ones that admit a simple, explicit solution), the best option is the Gart logit method for 1/3≤ OR≤3 and, if in other cases, the Agresti logit method. The Cornfield chi-squared and Gart logit methods should not be used outside the specified interval OR.

Moreover, the expected results aimed to improve the identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2) patients who may have critical outcomes.This retrospective study included laboratory-confirmed SARS-COV-2 cases between January 18, 2020, and February 16, 2020. The patients were divided into 2 groups with noncritical illness and critical illness regarding severity status within the hospitalization. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to explore the risk factors associated with clinical and radiological outcomes in patients with SARS-COV-2. The ROC curves were performed to compare the prediction performance of different factors.A total of 180 adult patients in this study included 20 critical patients and 160 noncritical patients. In univariate logistic regression analysis, 15 risk factors were significantly associated with critical outcomes. Of importance, C-reactive protein (1.051, 95% confidence interval 1.024-1.078), D-dimer (1.911, 95% CI, 1.050-3.478), and CT score (1.29, 95% CI, 1.053-1.529) on admission were independent risk factors in multivariate analysis. The combined model achieved a better performance in disease severity prediction (P = .05).CRP, D-dimer, and CT score on admission were independent risk factors for critical illness in adults with SARS-COV-2.

This disease has quickly developed into a global pandemic, resulting in over 350,000 deaths worldwide and over 5 million confirmed infections in a matter of 6 months. Although the genome of this novel viral RNA was sequenced quickly and testing kits were manufactured to assist in combatting COVID-19, the diagnosis and treatment will remain relatively unsuccessful until the pathology of this disease is fully understood. Histotechnology plays an important role in understanding the pathology of many diseases, including COVID-19. The first postmortem biopsy of a COVID-19 patient was collected on 27 January 2020, and the pathology finding was published in mid-February 2020. Since then, more studies have been published in scientific literatures as the global outbreak continues. This mini-review summarizes the published articles in which histotechnology aspects were utilized with the intent to understand the pathology of COVID-19.

The aim of this paper is to describe a systematic review protocol to evaluate level of adherence to NRT; the discrepancy of adherence to NRT in clinical and population-based studies and degree of association between level of adherence and success of smoking cessation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Literature search will use five databases (Medline, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO). Studies will be appraised for methodological quality using National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool. To reduce heterogeneity, we will analyse clinical trials and population-based studies separately; pooled analyses will be done among studies that used similar measurements. Heterogeneity of studies will be assessed by Higgins' I2 statistical test. When studies are adequately homogeneous, results will be pooled using random-effects model with proportion and ORs with 95% CIs and p values for each outcome. We will explain sources of heterogeneity by subgroup analysis or sensitivity analysis. Funnel plots and Egger's regression asymmetry test with p<0.05 will be used as a cut-off point to affirm presence of statistically significant publication bias. Statistical analyses will be carried out using Stata V.16 software. Only studies reporting a valid strategy to control for reverse causality will be included. DISCUSSION This review will provide evidence to support the importance of adherence on rate of smoking cessation and level of adherence to NRT.

Psychological and social factors that explain social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-12-10,"OBJECTIVE In acute traumatic brain injury, decompressive craniectomy is a common treatment that involves the removal of bone from the cranium to relieve intracranial pressure. The present study investigated whether neurological function following a severe spinal cord injury improves after utilizing either a durotomy to decompress the intradural space and/or a duraplasty to maintain proper flow of cerebrospinal fluid. METHODS Sixty-four adult female rats (n = 64) were randomly assigned to receive either a 3- or 5-level decompressive laminectomy (Groups A and B), laminectomy + durotomy (Groups C and D), or laminectomy + duraplasty with graft (Group E and F) at 24 hours following a severe thoracic contusion injury (200 kilodynes). Duraplasty involved the use of DuraSeal, a hydrogel dural sealant. Uninjured and injured control groups were included (Groups G, H). Hindlimb locomotor function was assessed by open field locomotor testing (BBB) and CatWalk gait analysis at 35 days postinjury. Bladder function was analyzed and bladder wall thickness was assessed histologically. At 35 days postinjury, mechanical and thermal allodynia were assessed by the Von Frey hair filament and hotplate paw withdrawal tests, respectively. Thereafter, the spinal cords were dissected, examined for gross anomalies at the injury site, and harvested for histological analyses to assess lesion volumes and white matter sparing. ANOVA was used for statistical analyses. RESULTS There was no significant improvement in motor function recovery in any treatment groups compared with injured controls. CatWalk gait analysis indicated a significant decrease in interlimb coordination in Groups B, C, and D (p < 0.05) and swing speed in Groups A, B, and D. Increased mechanical pain sensitivity was observed in Groups A, C, and F (p < 0.05). Rats in Group C also developed thermal pain hypersensitivity. Examination of spinal cords demonstrated increased lesion volumes in Groups C and F and increased white matter sparing in Group E (p < 0.05). The return of bladder automaticity was similar in all groups. Examination of the injury site during tissue harvest revealed that, in some instances, expansion of the hydrogel dural sealant caused compression of the spinal cord. CONCLUSIONS Surgical decompression provided no benefit in terms of neurological improvement in the setting of a severe thoracic spinal cord contusion injury in rats at 24 hours postinjury. Decompressive laminectomy and durotomy did not improve motor function recovery, and rats in both of these treatment modalities developed neuropathic pain. Performing a durotomy also led to increased lesion volumes. Placement of DuraSeal was shown to cause compression in some rats in the duraplasty treatment groups. Decompressive duraplasty of 3 levels does not affect functional outcomes after injury but did increase white matter sparing. Decompressive duraplasty of 5 levels led to neuropathic pain development and increased lesion volumes. Further comparison of dural repair techniques is necessary.","Jalan, Devesh; Saini, Neginder; Zaidi, Mohammad; Pallottie, Alexandra; Elkabes, Stella; Heary, Robert F",Journal of neurosurgery.

METHODS Searches based on the MeSH term 'polymyalgia rheumatica' were carried out in five databases. Two researchers were involved in screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessment. Once outcomes and instruments used were identified and categorised, key instruments were selected for further review through a consensus process. Studies on measurement properties of these instruments were appraised against the COSMIN-OMERACT (Outcome Measures in Rheumatology) checklist to determine the extent of evidence supporting their use in PMR. RESULTS 46 studies were included. In decreasing order of frequency, the most common outcomes (and instruments) used were: markers of systemic inflammation (ESR/CRP), pain (visual analogue scale (VAS)), stiffness (duration in minutes) and physical function (elevation of upper limbs). Instruments selected for further evaluation were ESR, CRP, pain VAS, morning stiffness duration and Health Assessment Questionnaire. Five studies evaluated measurement properties of these instruments, but none met all of the COSMINOMERACT checklist criteria. CONCLUSION Measurement of outcomes in studies of PMR lacks consistency. The critical patient-centred domain of physical function is poorly assessed. None of the candidate instruments considered for inclusion in the core outcome set had high quality evidence, derived from populations with PMR, on their full range of measurement properties. Further studies are needed to determine whether these instruments are suitable for inclusion in a Core Outcome Measurement set for PMR.","Twohig, Helen; Owen, Claire; Muller, Sara; Mallen, Christian; Mitchell, Caroline; Hider, Samantha; Hill, Catherine; Shea, Beverley; Mackie, Sarah",The Journal of rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.3899/jrheum.200248; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32739892/,110

This report describes a severe case of atypical pneumonia due to M. pneumoniae in a formerly healthy young woman who developed high grade fever and cough leading to severe disseminated lung disease and finally to fatal ARDS. This case came into picture when killer atypical pneumonia, namely, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), spread very fast from South-Asian countries to the rest of the world. Moreover, the clinical presentation and radiologic features of SARS bear resemblance to the syndrome of atypical pneumonia, which lead us to investigate this case into detail. We suggest that M. pneumoniae infections should be included in the differential diagnosis of pathogens causing ARDS, establishing an early diagnosis may have important therapeutic implications.","Chaudhry, Rama; Tabassum, Irum; Kapoor, Lata; Chhabra, Anjolie; Sharma, Nidhi; Broor, Shobha",Indian journal of pathology & microbiology,https://doi.org/10.4103/0377-4929.68283; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20699525/,110
97181,Spatial analysis of Brazil's COVID-19 response capacity: a proposal for a Healthcare Infrastructure Index.,2020-12-01,"Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has proven to be a non-invasive tool to analyse cells without the hurdle of employing exogenous dyes or probes. Nevertheless, the study of single live bacteria in their aqueous environment has long remained a big challenge, due to the strong infrared absorption of water and the small size of bacteria compared to the micron-range infrared wavelengths of the probing photons. To record infrared spectra of bacteria in an aqueous environment, at different spatial resolutions, two setups were developed. A custom-built attenuated total reflection inverted microscope was coupled to a synchrotron-based FTIR spectrometer, using a germanium hemisphere. With such a setup, a projected spot size of 1 × 1 μm2 was achieved, which allowed spectral acquisition at the single-cell level in the 1800-1300 cm-1 region. The second setup used a demountable liquid micro-chamber with a thermal source-powered FTIR microscope, in transmission geometry, for probing clusters of a few thousands of live cells in the mid-IR region (4000-975 cm-1). Both setups were applied for studying two strains of a model lactic acid bacterium exhibiting different cryo-resistances. The two approaches allowed the discrimination of both strains and revealed population heterogeneity among bacteria at different spatial resolutions. The multivariate analysis of spectra indicated that the cryo-sensitive cells presented the highest cell heterogeneity and the highest content of proteins with the α-helix structure. Furthermore, the results from clusters of bacterial cells evidenced phosphate and peptidoglycan vibrational bands associated with the cell envelope, as potential markers of resistance to environmental conditions.

98043,Reforming medical education: student experience during the covid-19 pandemic.,2021-01-07,"BACKGROUND Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody for patients with HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2)-positive breast cancer, which is added to regular treatment and reduces mortality. Originally, trastuzumab had to be administered intravenously (IV) over 30 min every 3 weeks for 1 year. Since 2012, a formulation for the subcutaneous (SC) administration of trastuzumab has been available, which has not yet been approved in the USA. Advocates claim that the SC formulation saves time and money, despite higher costs. The purpose of this study is to review existing literature concerning the comparative efficacy and risk of harms of trastuzumab IV and SC concerning patient-relevant health outcomes. METHODS We conducted searches in the Cochrane Library and MEDLINE for articles published through May 2018 in English or German. In addition, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov to identify unpublished studies. We dually reviewed the abstracts and full-text articles based on a priori defined inclusion criteria, rated the risk of bias of included studies, and assessed the strength of the evidence for each outcome of interest. Because data was insufficient for quantitative synthesis, we summarized results narratively. RESULTS We identified three RCTs (randomized controlled trials) meeting our eligibility criteria, which included data on 1003 patients. We found moderate evidence for similar event rates (20.05% vs. 18%, HR (hazard ratio) 0.88, CI 95% = 0.62-1.27), and mortality rates (10% vs. 8%, HR 0.76, CI 95% = 0.44-1.32) after 1.7 years for patients receiving trastuzumab IV and for patients receiving SC. Results remained similar after 3.3 years, though evidence lacked strength due to a high dropout rate. All trials reported more adverse events among the SC group than in the IV group. Evidence for these findings was of moderate strength. Nevertheless, more than 85% of the patients preferred trastuzumab SC over IV. Results concerning serious adverse events appeared to be heterogeneous. CONCLUSION Results of studies indicate similar efficacy between the two routes of administration. The higher rates of adverse events for SC administration were mainly attributable to injection site-related events. The clinical decision of whether to administer trastuzumab SC or IV requires the consideration of several factors and should be determined individually.","Van den Nest, Miriam; Glechner, Anna; Gold, Maria; Gartlehner, Gerald",Systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-019-1235-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31829250/,110

The thrombosis risk is generally 4-6 times higher than in a healthy population and depends on factors related to patient characteristics, tumor factors, and treatment-related factors. The decision-making for prophylactic anticoagulation is individualized according to the relative risks and benefits. The VTE risk has been quantified using different assessment scores. In recent years, an effort has been made to establish ""risk assessment models"" specifically for patients undergoing chemotherapy. AREAS COVERED This article reviews current data and ongoing research on predictive factors involved in cancer-related thrombosis and it is highlighted the currently suggested strategies for prophylaxis. Several trials that compared the two treatment options, direct factor Xa inhibitor or LMWH, with placebo and not each other are discussed. In this article, was analyzed the safety and efficacy features that led several international organizations such as ASCO, NCCN, and others, to issue guidelines for the prophylaxis and treatment of patients at high risk of thrombosis by using LMWH, fondaparinux and DOACs. EXPERT OPINION ASCO, NCCN, and other international organizations recommend thromboprophylaxis in high risk patients. However, further investigation is needed to define better biomarkers for more accurate identification of cancer patients that will benefit from anticoagulant treatment.","Papadopoulos, Vasileios; Tsapakidis, Konstantinos; Markou, Alexandra; Kokkalis, Alexandros; Aidarinis, Chrissovalantis; Kotsakis, Athanasios",Expert review of anticancer therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14737140.2021.1941889; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34139938/,110

METHODS This prospective cohort study included 221 consecutive male patients (>18 years old) with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 who had been hospitalized due to COVID-19. The patients were divided into 3 groups: Asymptomatic patients (n: 46), symptomatic patients who were hospitalized in the internal medicine unit (IMU) (n: 129), and patients who were hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) (n: 46). RESULTS As serum total testosterone level at baseline decreases, probability (%) to be in the ICU significantly increases (p = 0.001). As serum total testosterone level at baseline decreases, probability (%) of mortality significantly increases (p = 0.002). In the patients who had pre-COVID-19 serum gonadal hormones test (n: 24), serum total testosterone level significantly decreased from pre-COVID-19 level of 458 ± 198 ng/dl to 315 ± 120 ng/ml at the time of COVID-19 in the patients (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 might deteriorate serum testosterone level in SARS-CoV-2 infected male patients. Low serum total testosterone level at baseline has a significant increased risk for the ICU and mortality in patients with COVID-19.","Çayan, Selahittin; Uğuz, Mustafa; Saylam, Barış; Akbay, Erdem",The aging male : the official journal of the International Society for the Study of the Aging Male,https://doi.org/10.1080/13685538.2020.1807930; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32883151/,110

Patients were recruited from a larger multisite trial if they had a Medication Level Variability Index (MLVI) ≥ 2.0, indicating worrisome tacrolimus level fluctuation. The manualized intervention included 3 weekly phone calls and regular follow-up calls. A comparison group included patients who met enrollment criteria after the sub-protocol ended. Outcomes were defined before the intent-to-treat analysis. Feasibility was defined as ≥ 50% of participants completing the weekly calls. MLVI was compared pre- and 180 days post-enrollment and between intervention and comparison groups. Of 18 eligible patients, 15 enrolled. Seven additional patients served as the comparison. Seventy-five percent of participants completed ≥ 3 weekly calls; average time on protocol was 257.7 days.

The aim of this study was to assess early and late results of surgical treatment of acute patellar tendon rupture. Our hypothesis was that functional outcome is satisfactory. METHODS A retrospective study included 38 knees in 37 patients (4 female, 33 male). Mean age was 42.6 ± 9.9 years (range, 23-81 years). Lesions comprised 15 tendon body ruptures, 20 avulsions from the tip of the patella and 3 avulsions from the anterior tibial tuberosity. Tendon repair was protected in more than 95% of cases by a reinforcement frame: hamstring (21 cases), synthetic ligament (12 cases) or metallic wire (3 cases). Results were evaluated in 2 steps: on patient files at a mean follow-up of 7.1 months (range, 3-24 months) to assess complications and early functional and radiological results; and by phone at a mean follow-up of 9.3 years (range, 19-229 months) in order to assess long-term functional outcome on Lysholm score and patient satisfaction. RESULTS Thirty-one knees were assessed at a mean 7.1 months. Mean knee flexion was 128.5° ± 7.5° (range, 85°-150°), extension -1° (range, -15° to 0°) and Caton-Deschamps index 0.96 (range, 0.57-1.29). Twenty-three knees were further assessed at a mean 9.3 years. Mean Lysholm score was 93.7 points (range, 61-100). Ninety-six percent of patients were satisfied or very satisfied with the result. All had returned to their previous job, and 20 had returned to sports activities, including 8 at pretrauma level.

The first part of this review considered the history, principles of operation and efficiency of these devices. The aim of this part of the review is to summarise recent guidelines on the use of these devices and outline the problems that can occur. In particular, the effect of these devices on gas analysis, dead space, resistance to gas flow and blockage of the breathing system is considered. In children, it is important to consider the addition of dead space and resistance to gas flow. A body weight of 2.5 kg is probably the lower weight limit for use with heat and moisture exchangers, and 3 kg for filters. The resistance to gas flow of a heat- and moisture-exchanging filter added to a Mapleson F breathing system can cause a delay in the induction of anaesthesia.","Wilkes, A R",Anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2044.2010.06564.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21118189/,110

The patients were managed from remote until the symptoms were over. Sixty-five patients adhere the televideoconsultation completely and were cured, also with home oxygen therapy and other treatments additional to the standard anti-inflammatory and antibiotic drugs. However, they got stuck to full isolation while making use of no external human resources for health and relying entirely on the electronic prescription of their general practitioner and the help of the cohabiting family members. Two patients abandoned, including one owing to the lack of support from the cohabiting family member, and addressed themselves to the hospital care. However, they required no mechanical ventilation and were discharged being recovered within shortly. One over 90 years' old patient was hospitalised in agreement with the general practitioner for management problems.

Internationally, cases in newborns are few and the outcomes, in general, are good. There is no certainty of possible vertical transmission, and the presence of the virus in human milk is improbable. The gold standard for diagnosis is the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. We performed a literature review and presented a case of perinatal COVID-19. Clinical case We describe the case of a full-term male infant with a birth weight of 3450 g and history of rooming-in with another mother-baby pair, both positive for SARS-CoV-2. On the second day of life, the neonate developed pneumonia, with clinical, X-ray and ultrasound diagnostic confirmation. On the third day of life, RT-PCR was positive for SARS-CoV-2; the mother was also positive but remained asymptomatic. The patient required mechanical ventilation and was transferred to a tertiary level neonatal unit on day 5 of life, where congenital heart disease was ruled out. He evolved satisfactorily with a negative RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 on day 8 and was extubated and discharged on day 21 of life. Telephone follow-up was performed without complications. Conclusions The present case was classified as horizontal transmission with a short incubation period of COVID-19.","Lima-Rogel, Victoria; Villegas-Silva, Raúl; Coronado-Zarco, Alejandra; Estrada-Ruelas, Isaac; Vega, Alma R Sánchez-De la; Muro-Flores, Raúl H; Villa-Guillén, Mónica",Boletin medico del Hospital Infantil de Mexico,https://doi.org/10.24875/bmhim.20000230; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33661873/,110
119658,"Race, Power, and COVID-19: A Call for Advocacy within Bioethics.",2020-12-08,"Historically, many additives and catalysts used in plastics were based on compounds of toxic metals (and metalloids), like arsenic, cadmium, chromium(VI), and lead. Despite subsequent restrictions, hazardous additives remain in plastics in societal circulation because of the pervasiveness of many products and the more general contamination of recycled goods. However, little is understood about their presence and impacts in the environment, with most studies focusing on the role of plastics in acquiring metals from their surroundings through, for example, adsorption. Accordingly, this paper provides a review of the uses of hazardous, metal-based additives in plastics, the relevant European regulations that have been introduced to restrict or prohibit usage in various sectors, and the likely environmental impacts of hazardous additives once plastics are lost in nature. Examination of the literature reveals widespread occurrence of hazardous metals in environmental plastics, with impacts ranging from contamination of the waste stream to increasing the density and settling rates of material in aquatic systems. A potential concern from an ecotoxicological perspective is the diffusion of metals from the matrix of micro- and nanoplastics under certain physico-chemical conditions, and especially favorable here are the acidic environments encountered in the digestive tract of many animals (birds, fish, mammals) that inadvertently consume plastics. For instance, in vitro studies have shown that the mobilization of Cd and Pb from historical microplastics can greatly exceed concentrations deemed to be safe according to migration limits specified by the current European Toy Safety Directive (17 mg kg-1 and 23 mg kg-1, respectively). When compared with concentrations of metals typically adsorbed to plastics from the environment, the risks from pervasive, historical additives are far more significant.","Turner, Andrew; Filella, Montserrat",Environment international,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2021.106622; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34030075/,110

METHODS Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 38 family members of patients with advanced cancer (n=12) and bereaved family members (n=26) on when and how to effectively implement bereavement risk screening. Data was analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS Many participants indicated that they would be open to completing a self-report screening measure before and after the patient's death. Several suggested screening at multiple timepoints and the importance of follow-up. Participants viewed screening as an opportunity to connect to psychosocial support. CONCLUSIONS The findings suggest that family members appear supportive of sensitively-approached bereavement risk screening before and after a patient's death as an important component of quality psychosocial care. To optimize implementation, bereavement risk screening would involve screening at multiple timepoints and include follow-up. Findings suggest standardized risk screening using a brief, validated self-report tool would be a pragmatic approach to increasing access to bereavement care. This article is protected by copyright.

WHY DOES THIS MATTER?: There is widespread interest in whether drug interventions can be used for the prevention of covid-19, but there is uncertainty about which drugs, if any, are effective. The first version of this living guideline focuses on the evidence for hydroxychloroquine. Subsequent updates will cover other drugs being investigated for their role in the prevention of covid-19. RECOMMENDATION The guideline development panel made a strong recommendation against the use of hydroxychloroquine for individuals who do not have covid-19 (high certainty). HOW THIS GUIDELINE WAS CREATED This living guideline is from the World Health Organization (WHO) and provides up to date covid-19 guidance to inform policy and practice worldwide. Magic Evidence Ecosystem Foundation (MAGIC) provided methodological support. A living systematic review with network analysis informed the recommendations. An international guideline development panel of content experts, clinicians, patients, an ethicist and methodologists produced recommendations following standards for trustworthy guideline development using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. UNDERSTANDING THE NEW RECOMMENDATION The linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (6 trials and 6059 participants) found that hydroxychloroquine had a small or no effect on mortality and admission to hospital (high certainty evidence). There was a small or no effect on laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (moderate certainty evidence) but probably increased adverse events leading to discontinuation (moderate certainty evidence). The panel judged that almost all people would not consider this drug worthwhile. In addition, the panel decided that contextual factors such as resources, feasibility, acceptability, and equity for countries and healthcare systems were unlikely to alter the recommendation. The panel considers that this drug is no longer a research priority and that resources should rather be oriented to evaluate other more promising drugs to prevent covid-19. UPDATES This is a living guideline. New recommendations will be published in this article and signposted by update notices to this guideline. READERS NOTE This is the first version of the living guideline for drugs to prevent covid-19. It complements the WHO living guideline on drugs to treat covid-19.

126985,Social distancing and social interaction in children with autism spectrum disorder during the Covid-19 pandemic: a clinical oxymoron.,2021-04-12,"Studies have demonstrated that exposure to extreme outdoor temperatures increases cardiovascular disease mortality and morbidity. However, people spend 80%-90% of their time indoors, and the cumulative effects of exposure to high or low temperature on the risk of cardiovascular diseases had not been considered. This study investigated the cumulative effects of high or low indoor temperature exposure on the risk of cardiovascular diseases. We estimated indoor temperatures by using a prediction model of indoor temperature from a previous study and further calculated the cumulative degree hours at different indoor temperature ranges. Samples of emergency department visits due to cardiovascular diseases were collected from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database (LHID) from 2000 to 2014 in Taiwan. We used a distributed lag nonlinear model to analyze the data. Our data demonstrated a significant risk of emergency department visits due to cardiovascular diseases at 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31 °C when cooling cumulative degree hours exceeded 62, 43, 16, 1, and 1 during the hot season (May to October), respectively, and at 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23 °C when heating cumulative degree hours exceeded 1, 1, 1, 11, and 33 during the cold season (November to April), respectively. Cumulative degree hours were different according to gender and age groups. Policymakers should further consider the cumulative effects to prevent hot- or cold-related cardiovascular diseases for populations.","Jung, Chien-Cheng; Hsia, Ying-Fang; Hsu, Nai-Yun; Wang, Yu-Chun; Su, Huey-Jen",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138958; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408209/,110
127289,"To Inspire Vaccination, Inspire Hope: Introduction.",2021,"Previous studies of egg drop syndrome virus (EDSV) is restricted to serological surveys, disease diagnostics, and complete viral genome analysis. Consequently, the infection characteristics and entry routes of EDSV are poorly understood. Therefore, we aimed to explore the entry pathway of EDSV into duck embryonic fibroblast (DEF) cells as well as the infection characteristics and proliferation of EDSV in primary DEF and primary chicken embryo liver (CEL) cells. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the virus triggered DEF cell membrane invagination as early as 10 min post-infection and that integrated endocytic vesicles formed at 20 min post-infection. The virus yield in EDSV-infected DEF cells treated with chlorpromazine (CPZ), sucrose, methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), or NH4Cl was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Compared with the mock treatment, CPZ and sucrose greatly inhibited the production of viral progeny in a dose-dependent manner, while MβCD treatment did not result in a significant difference. Furthermore, NH4Cl had a strong inhibitory effect on the production of EDSV progeny. In addition, indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated that virus particles clustered on the surface of DEF cells treated with CPZ or sucrose. These results indicate that EDSV enters DEF cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis followed by a pH-dependent step, which is similar to the mechanism of entry of human adenovirus types 2 and 5.","Huang, Jingjing; Tan, Dan; Wang, Yang; Liu, Caihong; Xu, Jiamin; Wang, Jingyu",Virus research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.07.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26200954/,110
127781,From Paternalism to Engagement: Bioethics Needs a Paradigm Shift to Address Racial Injustice During COVID-19.,2021-02-01,"Tyrosinase catalyzes the rate-limiting step in melanin synthesis. Melanin is synthesized from l-tyrosin in the melanosomes, where tyrosinase and other melanogenic factors are recruited via the vesicle transport system. Genetic and biochemical approaches have revealed a correlation between impairments in the vesicle transport system and albinism. However, the specificity of the individual transport systems for the corresponding melanogenic factors has not been well elucidated yet. Here, we report that the thioxothiazolidin derivative, 4-OST (4-[(5E)-5-[(4-fluorophenyl)methylidene]-4-oxo-2-sulfanylidene-1,3-thiazolidin-3-yl]-4-azatricyclo [5.2.1.02 ,6]dec-8-ene-3,5-dione: CAS RN. 477766-87-3) strongly inhibited melanogenesis in mouse melanoma B16F10 cells. 4-OST reduces tyrosinase protein levels without affecting its messenger RNA levels or enzymatic activity. Although a reduction in tyrosinase protein level was observed in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor, the reduction may be coupled with protein synthesis. Similarly, GIF-2202 (a derivative of 4-OST) lowers tyrosinase protein levels without affecting the levels of another melanogenic enzyme, tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1) level. The reduction in tyrosinase protein level is associated with an increase in the levels of the lysosomal proteinase cathepsin S. Chloroquine, a lysosome inhibitor, restored the tyrosinase protein level downregulated by GIF-2202, although no effects of other inhibitors (against proteasome, autophagy, or exocytosis) were observed. In addition, GIF-2202 segregated the immunofluorescence signals of tyrosinase from those of TYRP1. Chloroquine treatment resulted in co-localization of tyrosinase and cathepsin S signals near the perinuclear region, suggesting that 4-OST and GIF-2202 may alter the destination of the tyrosinase vesicle from the melanosome to the lysosome. 4-OST and GIF-2202 can be new tools for studying the tyrosinase-specific vesicle transport system.","Isogawa, Kenta; Asano, Masataka; Hayazaki, Masumi; Koga, Kenichi; Watanabe, Miyu; Suzuki, Keiichi; Kobayashi, Takahiro; Kawaguchi, Kyoka; Ishizuka, Akane; Kato, Shinya; Ito, Hironari; Hamamoto, Akie; Koyama, Hiroko; Furuta, Kyoji; Takemori, Hiroshi",Journal of cellular biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcb.29895; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33480093/,110

Practical tips for supporting competency-based medical education during the COVID-19 pandemic.",2020-09-11,"Objectives: This study aimed to identify alterations in pharmacokinetics in children on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), identify knowledge gaps, and inform future pharmacology studies. Data Sources: We systematically searched the databases MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Embase from earliest publication until November 2018 using a controlled vocabulary and keywords related to ""ECMO"" and ""pharmacokinetics,"" ""pharmacology,"" ""drug disposition,"" ""dosing,"" and ""pediatrics."" Study Selection: Inclusion criteria were as follows: study population aged <18 years, supported on ECMO for any indications, received any medications while on ECMO, and reported pharmacokinetic data. Data Extraction: Clearance and/or volume of distribution values were extracted from included studies. Data Synthesis: Forty-one studies (total patients = 574) evaluating 23 drugs met the inclusion criteria. The most common drugs studied were antimicrobials (n = 13) and anticonvulsants (n = 3). Twenty-eight studies (68%) were conducted in children <1 year of age. Thirty-three studies (80%) were conducted without intra-study comparisons to non-ECMO controls. Increase in volume of distribution attributable to ECMO was demonstrated for nine (56%) drugs: cefotaxime, gentamicin, piperacillin/tazobactam, fluconazole, micafungin, levetiracetam, clonidine, midazolam, and sildenafil (range: 23-345% increase relative to non-ECMO controls), which may suggest the need for higher initial dosing. Decreased volume of distribution was reported for two drugs: acyclovir and ribavirin (50 and 69%, respectively). Decreased clearance was reported for gentamicin, ticarcillin/clavulanate, bumetanide, and ranitidine (range: 26-95% decrease relative to non-ECMO controls). Increased clearance was reported for caspofungin, micafungin, clonidine, midazolam, morphine, and sildenafil (range: 25-455% increase relative to non-ECMO controls). Conclusions: There were substantial pharmacokinetic alterations in 70% of drugs studied in children on ECMO. However, studies evaluating pharmacokinetic changes of many drug classes and those that allow direct comparisons between ECMO and non-ECMO patients are still lacking. Systematic evaluations of pharmacokinetic alterations of drugs on ECMO that incorporate multidrug opportunistic trials, physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling, and other methods are necessary for definitive dose recommendations.

129876,An update on developments in medical education in response to the COVID-19 pandemic: A BEME scoping review: BEME Guide No. 64.,2021-01-26,"BACKGROUND Cope's sign is the association of bradycardia with symptoms of acute cholecystitis, which can occur due to a vagal cardiobiliary reflex. The clinical and electrocardiographic changes of bradycardia or complete heart block can mimic the presentation of acute coronary syndrome. This report highlights the unique possibility that bradycardia in patients with abdominal pain and gallstones can be due to this reflex. CASE REPORT A 46-year-old obese man with hyperlipidemia and gallstones presented with chest pain suggestive of cardiac ischemia. The initial electrocardiography (EKG) was normal, although the patient subsequently developed bradycardia and a 2nd-degree atrioventricular (AV) block. The results of further cardiothoracic investigations (including echocardiography and pharmacologic stress testing) were normal. An ultrasound of the abdomen revealed acute cholecystitis. After he underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the chest pain resolved completely, and the EKG reverted to its normal sinus rhythm. CONCLUSIONS Acute cholecystitis rarely presents with cardiac chest pain and EKG changes due to triggering of the vagal cardiobiliary reflex. Given this atypical presentation, patients often undergo invasive cardiac procedures in search of a nonexistent cardiac etiology coupled with the possibility of a missed diagnosis of cholecystitis. When clinicians consider a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome in patients with bradycardia, T-wave inversion, and ST-segment elevation (especially in the inferior leads), they should add the possibility of intra-abdominal pathologies (including cholecystitis) in the differential diagnosis.","Daliparty, Vasudev Malik; Amoozgar, Behzad; Razzeto, Alejandra; Ehsanullah, Syed Usman Mohsin; Rehman, Faseeha",The American journal of case reports,https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.932078; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34548467/,110
130813,Identifying and responding to domestic violence and abuse in healthcare settings.,2021-05-07,"Two self-adhering hemostatic patches, based on either PEG-coated collagen (PCC) or PEG-coated oxidized cellulose (PCOC), are compared regarding to maximum burst pressure, mechanical stability, and swelling. In addition, the induction of tissue adhesions by the materials was assessed in a rabbit liver abrasion model. Both materials showed comparable sealing efficacy in a burst pressure test (37 ± 16 vs. 35 ± 8 mmHg, P = 0.730). After incubation in human plasma, PCC retained its mechanical properties over the test period of 8 h, while PCOC showed faster degradation after the 2 h time-point. The degradation led to a significantly decreased force at break (minimum force at break 0.55 N during 8 h for PCC, 0.27 N for PCOC; p < 0.001). Further, PCC allowed significantly higher deformation before break (52% after 4 h and 50% after 8 h for PCC, 18% after 4 h and 23% after 8 h for PCOC; p = 0.003 and p < 0.001 for 4 h and 8 h, respectively) and showed less swelling in human plasma (maximum increase in thickness: ~20% PCC, ~100% PCOC). Faster degradation of PCOC was visible macroscopically and histologically in vivo after 14 days. PCC showed visible structural residues with little cellular infiltration while strong infiltration with no remaining structural material was seen with PCOC. In vivo, a higher incidence of adhesion formation after PCOC application was detected. In conclusion, PCC has more reliable mechanical properties, reduced swelling, and less adhesion formation than PCOC. PCC may offer greater clinical benefit for surgeons in procedures that have potential risk for body fluid leakage or that require prolonged mechanical stability.","Slezak, Paul; Monforte, Xavier; Ferguson, James; Sutalo, Sanja; Redl, Heinz; Gulle, Heinz; Spazierer, Daniel",Journal of materials science.

Treatment options have traditionally consisted of conservative measures including topical and oral medication management as well as transcutaneous electrical stimulation units. These treatments demonstrate various degrees of efficacy, and many times initial treatments are discontinued, indicating low levels of satisfaction or poor tolerability. Spinal cord stimulation has been proposed as an alternative therapy for treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy of the lower extremities. We performed a systematic literature review to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of this procedure. A literature search identified 14 prospective studies. Based on our analysis of the available evidence, there is moderate-quality evidence for the safety and efficacy of spinal cord stimulation for painful diabetic neuropathy. However, further high-quality research, including a large-scale randomized controlled trial is warranted.","Henson, Josianna V; Varhabhatla, Narayana C; Bebic, Zvonimir; Kaye, Alan D; Yong, R Jason; Urman, Richard D; Merkow, Justin S",Pain and therapy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40122-021-00282-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34244979/,110

Such fistulas pose unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. METHODS Case report and literature review. RESULTS In a patient presenting with papilledema, non-invasive brain vascular imaging disclosed subtle signs of a DAVF. Digital angiography delineated the DAVF and revealed cortical venous reflux. After three transarterial embolizations with ethylene vinyl alcohol, the DAVF was closed and papilledema resolved. CONCLUSIONS The imaging features of a DAVF that cause papilledema may be subtle on non-invasive vascular imaging. If overlooked, and lumbar puncture is performed, there is a substantial risk of brain herniation. Cortical venous reflux, which may be relatively common in these DAVFs, impels the need for endovascular closure. The transvenous route, often employed for closing cavernous sinus DAVFs, should be avoided because of the dangers of dural venous sinus thrombosis.","Chaudhary, Neeraj; Griauzde, Julius; Gemmete, Joseph J; Pandey, Aditya S; Trobe, Jonathan D",Journal of neuro-ophthalmology : the official journal of the North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society,https://doi.org/10.1097/wno.0000000000000118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24739992/,110

139046,North Carolina Has Strong Infrastructure to Get Even Better on Childhood Vaccines.,2021,"Ignoring background sounds while focusing on a visual task is a necessary ability in everyday life. If attentional resources are shared between modalities, processing of task-irrelevant auditory information should become attenuated when attentional capacity is expended by visual demands. According to the early-filter model, top-down attenuation of auditory responses is possible at various stages of the auditory pathway through multiple recurrent loops. Furthermore, the adaptive filtering model of selective attention suggests that filtering occurs early when concurrent visual tasks are demanding (e.g., high load) and late when tasks are easy (e.g., low load). To test these models, this study examined the effects of three levels of visual load on auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) at three modulation frequencies. Subjects performed a visual task with no, low, and high visual load while ignoring task-irrelevant sounds. The auditory stimuli were 500-Hz tones amplitude-modulated at 20, 40, or 80 Hz to target different processing stages of the auditory pathway. Results from bayesian analyses suggest that ASSRs are unaffected by visual load. These findings imply that attentional resources are modality specific and that the attentional filter of auditory processing does not vary with visual task demands.","Szychowska, Malina; Wiens, Stefan",Physiology & behavior,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2020.113240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33188789/,110

Although ground squirrels are a model group for the study of vocal individuality, this phenomenon has not yet been studied in a species producing two such completely different types of alarms. Most of ground squirrel species produce either whistle or wideband alarms and this species represents a unique model for testing the degree of individual variability depending on completely different acoustic structures. We analysed 269 whistle alarms produced by 13 individuals and 591 wideband alarms from 25 individuals at the western part of Lake Baikal. A discriminant function analysis (DFA) assigned 93.5% (88.9%, cross-validated result) of whistle alarms to the correct individual and 91.4% (84%) of wideband alarms. This is the first evidence of individual variation in wideband alarms compared with whistle alarms and occurrence of vocal individuality in two warning signals of a completely different acoustic structure produced by a ground squirrel.","Goncharov, Denis; Policht, Richard; Hambálková, Lucie; Salovarov, Viktor; Hart, Vlastimil",Royal Society open science,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.200147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33972833/,110

As complex interventions, they require careful delivery to generate net benefit. Much screening work occurs in primary care. Despite intensive study of intervention delivery in primary care, there is currently no synthesis of the delivery of screening programmes in this setting. The purpose of this review is to describe and critically evaluate the delivery of screening programmes in general practice and community services. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will use scoping review methods to explore which components of screening programmes are delivered in primary care and systematic review methods to locate and synthesise evidence on how screening programmes can be delivered in primary care, including barriers, facilitators and strategies. We will include empirical studies of any design which consider screening programmes in high-income countries, based in part or whole in primary care. We will search 20 information sources from 1 January 2000, including those relating to health (eg, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL), management (eg, Rx for change database) and grey literature (eg, OpenGrey, screening committee websites). Two reviewers will screen citations and full texts of potentially eligible studies and assess these against inclusion criteria. Qualitative and quantitative data will be extracted in duplicate and synthesised using a best fit framework approach. Within the systematic review, the mixed methods appraisal tool will be used to assess risk of bias. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION No ethics approval is required. We will disseminate findings to academics through publication and presentation, to decision-makers through national screening bodies, to practitioners through professional bodies, and to the public through social media.

METHODS A retrospective review was conducted on 188 patients with recurrent PSP, of a population of 1414 patients who underwent VATS wedge resection for PSP. Reoperations were performed when an air leak persisted longer than 3 days after closed thoracostomy, when a visible bulla of greater than 1 cm on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was observed and when rerecurrence took place after other treatments. The HRCT findings before and after recurrence were compared to evaluate the type of the new bulla. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the additional procedure performed during the first operation; in Group I, a coverage procedure was performed, and in Group II, mechanical pleurodesis was performed after VATS wedge resection. RESULTS During a median follow-up period of 27.7 months, 76 patients underwent repeated VATS for ipsilateral recurrent PSP after VATS. The indications for repeated VATS were the presence of a bulla on HRCT in 41 patients and a persistent air leak in 35 patients. Group I comprised 36 patients and Group II comprised 40 patients. The HRCT findings showed no bulla in 3 (4%) patients, were suspicious for a bulla in 11 (15%) patients, showed a bulla at the staple line in 26 (34%) patients and showed a new bulla in a location other than on the staple line in 36 (47%) patients. The frequency of new bullae was not different between the 2 groups, but Group I showed a lesser tendency for bullae to occur at the staple line than Group II. Dense fibrosis around the staple line was also found intraoperatively.

Methods: This study integrates the available literature on internet of things (IoT) e-health ecosystem and informal care. Results: In the first part of this article, we describe the health consequences of quarantine and isolation and outline the potential role of informal care in containing the risk of spreading the infection and reducing the burden on the health care system. Then, we present an overview of the characteristics of emerging technological ecosystems in health care and how they can be adopted as a strategic option to achieve different goals: (1) support informal carers to help vulnerable populations during quarantine and isolation and facilitate the recovery process; (2) promote the adoption of e-health and telemedicine resources to reduce the well-documented burden experienced by caregivers; and (3) lessen the various forms of digital disadvantage among vulnerable individuals, who are at more risk to be digitally excluded. In the last part of this work, we introduce solutions to overcome potential challenges related to the development and adoption of advanced technological ecosystems and propose a reflection on the legacy of COVID-19 on telemedicine. Conclusions: Thanks to the disruptive potential of IoT for health and wellness promotion, technological ecosystems emerge as a valuable resource to support both informal carers and vulnerable populations. The main factors that represent a strategic advantage of a technological ecosystem are affordability, regulatory, and availability. A high degree of interconnection between all the stakeholders emerges as a key element for the provision of intergenerational care. The most important technical challenges of IoT e-health require to optimize privacy, security, and user-friendliness of IoT e-health.","Blasioli, Emanuele; Hassini, Elkafi",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0522; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33887168/,110

Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of patients admitted during the month of March 2020 to the nonintensive COVID unit of Udine University Hospital on the basis of a positive swab test and/or of clinical-radiologic signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients were interviewed with a standardized questionnaire. Clinical and laboratory data were collected. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, and results expressed as point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results Of 141 patients admitted, 93 were interviewed. Hyposmia and dysgeusia were present in 58 cases (62.4%). In 22.4% of them, olfactory and gustatory impairment clearly preceded systemic symptoms. The presence of active smoking was very limited in both groups: 8.6% in hyposmic vs 2.9% in normosmic patients (odds ratio 3.2; 95% CI 0.3-28.6). Moreover, total leukocytes and neutrophils count were respectively 23% (effect estimate 1.23; 95% CI 1.06-1.42) and 29% (effect estimate 1.29; 95% CI 1.07-1.54) lower in the hyposmic cohort. No difference was found for other inflammatory biomarkers. Conclusions Hyposmia and dysgeusia are common in SARS-CoV-2 infection and can precede systemic symptoms. They should be actively searched and prompt close monitoring and isolation until infection is confirmed or disproven. The lower number of total leukocytes and neutrophils in hyposmic patients might indicate an early-phase virus-induced cytopenia.","Bax, Francesco; Tascini, Carlo; Valente, Mariarosaria; Marini, Alessandro; Surcinelli, Andrea; Pellitteri, Gaia; De Carlo, Chiara; Gerussi, Valentina; Gigli, Gian Luigi",Neurology.

We aimed to identify the clinical risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infections in Korea, where social distancing and face masks have been strongly recommended. Methods The data of individuals who underwent the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2 between January 3 and May 31, 2020 were retrieved from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service dataset. We used multivariable logistic regression models to identify the risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infections in the population. Results We retrieved the results of 219,729 SARS-CoV-2 tests, of which 7,333 were positive results. In the multivariable analysis, female sex was associated with a higher risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 [odds ratio (OR) =1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.24-1.37, P<0.0001]. Additionally, populations living in areas that had large outbreaks of COVID-19 were at an increased risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (OR =6.87, 95% CI: 6.55-7.21, P<0.0001). The odds of a positive test were greater for the Medical Aid beneficiaries (OR =1.99, 95% CI: 1.82-2.18, P<0.0001) than for the National Health Insurance beneficiaries. Individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM) were more likely to test positive (OR =1.15, 95% CI: 1.07-1.24, P=0.0002). Conclusions Women, individuals living in areas with large outbreaks of COVID-19, Medical Aid beneficiaries, and individuals with DM might have greater risks of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infections despite practicing social distancing and using face masks.","Park, Seon Cheol; Won, Sun Young; Kim, Na Hye; Choi, Heun; Youk, Tae Mi; Lee, Hyun Jung; Jeon, Han Ho",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-5958; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33708838/,110
149152,Simulation with standardized patients to prepare undergraduate nursing students for mental health clinical practice: An integrative literature review.,2018,"AIM To identify strategies that increase hospital bed capacity, material resources, and available nurse staffing during a national pandemic. BACKGROUND The COVID-19 outbreak resulted in an influx of acutely ill patients requiring critical care. The volume and acuity of this patient population increased the demand for care and stretched hospitals beyond their capacity. While increasing hospital bed capacity and material resources are crucial, healthcare systems have noted one of the greatest limitations to rapid expansion has been the number of available medical personnel, particularly those trained in emergency and critical care nursing. EVALUATION Program evaluation occurred on a daily basis with hospital throughput, focusing on logistics including our ability to expand bed volume, resource utilization, and the ability to meet staffing needs. CONCLUSION This article describes how a quaternary care hospital in New York City prepared for the COVID-19 surge in patients by maximizing and shifting nursing resources to its most impacted services, the emergency department (ED) and the intensive care units (ICUs). A tier-based staffing model and rapid training were operationalized to address nurse-staffing shortages in the ICU and ED, identifying key factors for swift deployment. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGERS Frequent communication between staff and leaders improves teamwork and builds trust and buy-in during normal operations and particularly in times of crisis.","Wells, Celia M; Zhang, Ziya; Spano-Szekely, Lauraine; Siller, Jennifer; Brannon, Helen; Schulz, Kathleen; Scott, Christine; Dolphy, Melody; Hughes, Ellen; Kohli-Seth, Roopa",The Journal of nursing administration,https://doi.org/10.1097/nna.0000000000000979; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33449602/,110
149923,[Quality management and patient safety in the time of health crisis].,2020-08-01,"BACKGROUND The effect of extended post-discharge thromboprophylaxis (ETP) on venous thromboembolism (VTE) rates following bariatric surgery (BS) is unknown. METHODS 308 consecutive patients who underwent BS between 2003 and 2007 and who had > 1 month of follow-up were included. In-hospital-only VTE prophylaxis (group A), or extended 10-day ETP (group B) was used in 132 and 176 patients, respectively. All patients underwent bilateral lower extremity venous Doppler studies (BLEVDS) prior to discharge. Primary endpoint was the incidence of VTE within 30 days postoperatively. VTE was defined as a clinically evident deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism documented by positive BLEVDS, or computed chest tomography. The primary safety endpoint was bleeding associated with > or = 2 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin compared with baseline, transfusion or reoperation. RESULTS The incidence of VTE was 1.9% (6/308); 66.6% (4/6) of cases occurred after cessation of thromboprophylaxis. There were no deaths in either group. With the exception of percentage open surgical approach (A: 3% versus B: 0%, p = 0.03), percentage conversions (A: 0 versus B: 3.8%, p = 0.01), and hospital stay (A: 3 versus B: 2.2 days, p < 0.0001), the two groups were comparable in relation to age, sex, body mass index, percentage revision surgery, operative time, and history of VTE. VTE rate was significantly higher in group A (A: 4.5% versus B: 0%, p = 0.006). Although morbidity was higher in group A (A: 12.1% versus B: 1.1%, p < 0.0001), no VTE event occurred in patients who had other complications. The incidence of significant bleeding was lower in group B (A: 5.3% versus B: 0.56%, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS ETP is safe and effective in reducing the incidence of VTE as compared with in-hospital thromboprophylaxis only.","Raftopoulos, Ioannis; Martindale, Carolyn; Cronin, Andrea; Steinberg, Jeffrey",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-008-0031-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18622558/,110

Specific, highly effective therapeutics and vaccines against the MERS-CoV are urgently needed to save human lives and address the pandemic concerns. We identified three human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), m336, m337, and m338, targeting the receptor (CD26/DPP4) binding domain (RBD) of the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein from a very large naïve-antibody library (containing ∼10(11) antibodies). They bound with high affinity: equilibrium dissociation constants for the three MAbs were equal to 4.2, 9.3, and 15 nM, respectively, as measured by Biacore for Fabs binding to RBD. The avidity for IgG1 m336, m337, and m338 was even higher: 99, 820, and 560 pM, respectively. The antibodies bound to overlapping epitopes that overlap the receptor binding site on the RBD as suggested by competition experiments and further supported by site-directed mutagenesis of the RBD and a docking model of the m336-RBD complex. The highest-affinity MAb, m336, neutralized both pseudotyped and live MERS-CoV with exceptional potency, 50% neutralization at 0.005 and 0.07 μg/ml, respectively, likely by competing with DPP4 for binding to the S glycoprotein. The exceptionally high neutralization activity of these antibodies and especially m336 suggests that they have great potential for prophylaxis and therapy of MERS-CoV infection in humans and as a tool for development of vaccine immunogens. The rapid identification (within several weeks) of potent MAbs suggests a possibility to use the new large antibody library and related methodology for a quick response to the public threat resulting from emerging coronaviruses. Importance: A novel human coronavirus, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was found to infect humans with a high mortality rate in 2012, just 1 decade after the appearance of the first highly pathogenic coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). There are no effective therapeutics available. It is highly desirable to find an approach for rapidly developing potent therapeutics against MERS-CoV, which not only can be implemented for MERS treatment but also can help to develop a platform strategy to combat future emerging coronaviruses. We report here the identification of human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) from a large nonimmune antibody library that target MERS-CoV. One of the antibodies, m336, neutralized the virus with exceptional potency. It therefore may have great potential as a candidate therapeutic and as a reagent to facilitate the development of vaccines against MERS-CoV.","Ying, Tianlei; Du, Lanying; Ju, Tina W; Prabakaran, Ponraj; Lau, Candy C Y; Lu, Lu; Liu, Qi; Wang, Lili; Feng, Yang; Wang, Yanping; Zheng, Bo-Jian; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Jiang, Shibo; Dimitrov, Dimiter S",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00912-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24789777/,110

We sought to retrospectively examine the long-term results of self-expanding stent usage in conjunction with coil embolization in treatment of wide-neck cerebral aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS We coiled 500 wide-neck cerebral aneurysms with different types of self-expanding neurostent assistance in 468 patients. Patient and aneurysm characteristics, pharmacologic therapy protocol, complications, and initial occlusion grades were analyzed. Patients underwent angiographic follow-up at 6 months to 7 years after treatment. DSA or MRA images of all patients were analyzed to assess the occlusion rate of aneurysms and patency of the parent artery. RESULTS Enterprise (n = 340), Solitaire (n = 98), Wingspan (n = 41), LEO (n = 16), and Neuroform (n = 5) stent systems were used in this series. Stent-related thromboembolic events occurred in 21 patients and intraoperative rupture occurred in 4 patients. Initially, complete occlusion was achieved in 42.2% of the aneurysms, and, according to the last follow-up data, the rate had progressed to 90.8%. Recanalization rate at 6 months was 8%, whereas the late recanalization rate was 2%. CONCLUSIONS The use of stents in endovascular treatment provides high rates of complete occlusion and low rates of recurrence at a long-term follow-up study.","Geyik, S; Yavuz, K; Yurttutan, N; Saatci, I; Cekirge, H S",AJNR.

Currently, there are no vaccines or effective therapeutic interventions for this virus. Development of an attenuated vaccine for HuNoV has been hampered by the inability to grow the virus in cell culture. Thus, a vector-based vaccine may be ideal. In this study, we constructed a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV-VP1) expressing VP1, the major capsid protein of HuNoV. Expression of the capsid protein by VSV resulted in the formation of HuNoV virus-like particles (VLPs) that are morphologically and antigenically similar to native virions. Recombinant rVSV-VP1 was attenuated in cultured mammalian cells as well as in mice. Mice inoculated with a single dose of rVSV-VP1 through intranasal and oral routes stimulated a significantly stronger humoral and cellular immune response than baculovirus-expressed VLP vaccination. Moreover, we demonstrated that mice inoculated with rVSV-VP1 triggered a comparable level of fecal and vaginal IgA antibody. Taken together, the VSV recombinant system not only provides a new approach to generate HuNoV VLPs in vitro but also a new avenue for the development of vectored vaccines against norovirus and other noncultivable viruses.","Ma, Yuanmei; Li, Jianrong",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02332-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21228240/,110

Plastic can be made from different polymers and contains a variety of substances, added intentionally to enhance the plastic's properties (metals added as fillers, colourants, etc.). Moreover, plastic can be contaminated during use and subsequent waste management. Consequently, if substances and contaminants are not removed during recycling, potentially problematic substances might be recycled with the targeted polymers, hence the need for quantitative data about the nature and presence of these substances in plastic. Samples of selected polymers (PET, PE, PP, PS) were collected from different origins; plastic household waste, flakes/pellets of reprocessed plastic from households and industry, and virgin plastic. Fifteen selected metals (Al, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Li, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, Ti, Zn) were quantified and the statistical analysis showed that both the polymer and origin influenced the metal concentration. Sb and Zn were potentially related to the production stage of PET and PS, respectively. Household plastic samples (waste and reprocessed) were found to contain significantly higher Al, Pb, Ti and Zn concentrations when compared to virgin samples. Only the concentration of Mn was reduced during washing, suggesting that parts of it was present as physical contamination. While most of the metals were below legal limit values, elevated concentrations in reprocessed plastic from households, aligned with increasing recycling rates, may lead to higher metal concentrations in the future.","Eriksen, M K; Pivnenko, K; Olsson, M E; Astrup, T F",Waste management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2018.08.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30343792/,110

Two major contributors to blood loss are the hysterotomy and the bladder dissection. We introduce a new surgical technique and hypothesize that developing the hysterotomy with a linear cutter and mobilization of the bladder using a vessel sealing system (VSS) before clamping uterine arteries will lead to a total reduction in blood loss and transfusion rates. Materials and methods: This was a case series, which presents clinical outcomes according to our described surgical technique. The following surgical outcomes were collected: operation time (minutes), estimated blood loss (EBL), intraoperative complications, need for reoperation before discharge, and transfusion rates. Our surgical technique utilizes a linear cutter to create a bloodless hysterotomy and a VSS to dissect the vesicouterine tissue. The VSS cauterizes and transects the small vesicouterine and placental-vesical vascular anastomoses that are prone to bleeding. Once the bladder is mobilized below the level of the cervix, the uterine arteries are ligated to complete the key components of the hysterectomy. Results: Of the 23 cases, the median EBL was 1500 cubic centimeters and patients received a median of 1 unit of packed red blood cells. Eleven of the 23 cases did not require any blood transfusion and no patients required massive transfusion. The EBL did not differ between procedures that were performed emergently versus scheduled and it also did not differ between patients that had placenta increta versus placenta percreta, as diagnosed by histopathology. Conclusion: Use of a linear cutter and closure of the lower anastomosis with VSS prior to clamping uterine artery during cesarean hysterectomy can significantly reduce blood loss and transfusion rates. This technique is applicable in emergent and nonemergent settings as well as for the most challenging procedures complicated by placenta percreta.","Turan, Ozhan M; Shannon, Allison; Asoglu, Mehmet R; Goetzinger, Katherine R","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2019.1656194; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31455134/,110

Medical practices are responding by developing, disseminating and implementing unprecedented changes in health care delivery. Telemedicine has rapidly moved to the frontline of clinical practice due to the need for prevention and mitigation strategies; these have been encouraged, facilitated, and enabled by changes in government rules and regulations and payer-driven reimbursement policies.We describe our neurology department's situational transformation from in-person outpatient visits to a largely virtual neurology practice in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Two key factors enabled our rapid deployment of virtual encounters in neurology and its subspecialties. The first was a well-established robust information technology infrastructure supporting virtual urgent care services at our institution; this connected physicians directly to patients using both the physician's and the patient's own mobile devices. The second is the concept of one patient, one chart, facilitated by a suite of interconnected electronic medical record (EMR) applications on several different device types.We present our experience with conducting general teleneurology encounters using secure synchronous audio and video connections integrated with an EMR. This report also details how we perform virtual neurological examinations that are clinically meaningful, and how we document, code and bill for these virtual services.

Patients experience benefit in length of hospital stay as well as diminished narcotic use. Single-incision laparoscopic colectomy (SIL-C) may offer additional benefit compared to traditional laparoscopic colectomy without compromising oncologic principles. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed records of patients who underwent SIL-C and traditional laparoscopic colectomy (TLC) for potentially malignant and malignant disease performed by a single surgeon. SIL-C consisted of a single-port access device with traditional lateral-to-medial laparoscopic technique. RESULTS Between January and October 2009, 27 SIL-C procedures were performed. Forty-six TLC patients from the prior year were used as controls. Median age was 70 years and 54% were female, with no differences between the groups. The median body mass index (BMI) was 27 kg/m(2) (range = 18.3-39.9) and 26 kg/m(2) (16.6-71.4) for SIL-C and TLC, respectively. The median lymph node harvest was 15 (range = 3-32) and 17 (0-35) for SIL-C and TLC, respectively. The median operative time was 114 min (range = 59-268) and 135 min (45-314) for SIL-C and TLC, respectively. Five SIL-C required additional ports while six TLC required conversion to open technique. The median length of stay was 3 days (range = 2-17) and 5 days (range = 2-11) for SIL-C and TLC, respectively (p = 0.079). There were five significant postoperative complications in the SIL-C group and 16 in the TLC group, including four postoperative ileus and one leak. There were no postoperative deaths in the SIL-C group and two in the TLC group. CONCLUSIONS SIL-C can be used safely in selected colon cancer patients with no difference in blood loss, OR time, or lymph node retrieval.

162375,Association of Mental Health and Aggression against Co-Workers in Indian Banks during COVID 19,2021,"Importance An altered sense of smell and taste has been reported to be associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To understand the evolution of these symptoms during the course of the disease is important to identify patients with persistent loss of smell or taste and estimate the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on the burden of olfactory and gustative dysfunctions. Objective To evaluate the evolution of the loss of sense of smell and taste in a case series of mildly symptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional survey-based study included 202 mildly symptomatic adults (≥18 years) consecutively assessed at Treviso Regional Hospital, Italy, between March 19 and March 22, 2020, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal and throat swabs. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of altered sense of smell and taste at follow-up and their variation from baseline. Results Of 202 patients completing the survey at baseline, 187 (92.6%) also completed the follow-up survey (103 [55.1%] women; median age, 56 years). The evaluation of the evolution of altered sense of smell or taste in the 113 patients reporting sudden onset of these symptoms at baseline showed that 55 patients (48.7%; 95% CI, 39.2-58.3) reported complete resolution of smell or taste impairment, 46 (40.7%; 95% CI, 31.6-50.4) reported an improvement in the severity, and only 12 (10.6%; 95% CI, 5.6-17.8) reported the symptom was unchanged or worse. Persistent loss of smell or taste was not associated with persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions and Relevance At 4 weeks from the onset, 89% of the SARS-CoV-2-positive mildly symptomatic patients who had had a sudden onset of altered sense of smell or taste experienced a complete resolution or improvement of these symptoms. Persistent loss of smell or taste was not associated with persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Boscolo-Rizzo, Paolo; Borsetto, Daniele; Fabbris, Cristoforo; Spinato, Giacomo; Frezza, Daniele; Menegaldo, Anna; Mularoni, Francesca; Gaudioso, Piergiorgio; Cazzador, Diego; Marciani, Silvia; Frasconi, Samuele; Ferraro, Maria; Berro, Cecilia; Varago, Chiara; Nicolai, Piero; Tirelli, Giancarlo; Da Mosto, Maria Cristina; Obholzer, Rupert; Rigoli, Roberto; Polesel, Jerry; Hopkins, Claire",JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2020.1379; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32614442/,110

(Special Issue: COVID-19 and tourism.)",2021,"Infectious diseases, ideas, new products, and other infectants spread in epidemic fashion through social contact. The COVID-19 pandemic, the proliferation of fake news, and the rise of antimicrobial resistance have thrust economic epidemiology into the forefront of public policy debate and reinvigorated the field. Focusing for concreteness on disease-causing pathogens, this review provides a taxonomy of economic-epidemic models, emphasizing both the biology/immunology of the disease and the economics of the social context. An economic epidemic is one whose diffusion through the agent population is generated by agents' endogenous behavior. I highlight properties of the equilibrium epidemic trajectory and discuss ways in which public health authorities can change the game for the better by (a) imposing restrictions on agent activity to reduce the harm done during a viral outbreak and (b) enabling diagnostic-informed interventions to slow or even reverse the rise of antibiotic resistance.","McAdams, D.","Annual Review of Economics, Vol 13, 2021",https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-economics-082120-122900,110
163239,The gift of homeschooling: Adult homeschool graduates and their parents conceptualize homeschooling in North Carolina,2021,"Background: Despite growing evidence of mindbody therapies for physical and psychological health among patients with cancer, their access remains limited. The COVID-19 pandemic has further disrupted the delivery of necessary cancer and supportive care;thus, the need to support patients with cancer is unprecedented. To expand the reach and access of mind-body therapies, we developed, implemented, and evaluated a novel virtual mind-body program for patients with cancer. Methods: We rapidly developed a 7-day a week virtual mind-body program, Integrative Medicine at Home (IM@Home), for patients with cancer (ages ≥18 years) and deployed it on April 1 , 2020. IM@Home included mind-body group therapy classes in fitness, meditation, yoga, dance, tai chi, and music delivered using Zoom video conferencing. Classes ranged from 30-45 minutes and were led by an integrative medicine clinician. Patients had the option to register for a 1-month, 3-month, or 6-month membership to gain unlimited access to all virtual mind-body classes. Multi-method evaluation was conducted using the RE-AIM conceptual framework to guide surveys and qualitative interviews. Surveys were analyzed using descriptive statistics and interviews were analyzed using grounded theory. Results: Between April 2020 and January 2021, IM@Home registered over 32,000 class participants, with a weekly average attendance of 700-800 participants. In a 4-month postdeployment survey (n = 131), nearly all participants were satisfied with IM@Home (93.9%) and would recommend the program to friends and family (95.4%). A majority of participants also found IM@Home to be simple to use (87.0%) and said the program had a variety of classes that interested them (93.1%). Three-quarters of participants (74.8%) were taking 3 to 7 classes a week (range: 1 to 15 classes), among which the most popular classes were fitness (88.7%), chair yoga (37.1%), and tai chi (33.1%). Most participants preferred a 3- month membership (51.6%), followed by a 6- month membership (19.5%). In qualitative interviews (n = 30), participants reported IM@Home helped them to: 1) maintain structured routines and stay motivated to exercise;2) cope with COVID-19-related and cancer-related stressors;and 3) connect with their fellow cancer patient community and foster social relationships during a time of isolation. Conclusions: Virtual mind-body programming, through IM@Home, reached many patients with cancer to address their physical and psychological challenges during COVID-19. As patients with cancer experience high physical and psychological symptom burden following diagnosis, future clinical trials are needed to evaluate the specific effects of IM@Home when integrated into active treatment and survivorship care.","Mao, J.

163598,Determinants of Family Stress and Domestic Violence: Lessons from the COVID-19 Outbreak,2021,"Background Mortality rates provide an opportunity to identify and act on the health system intervention for preventing deaths. Hence, it is essential to appreciate the influence of age structure while reporting mortality for a better summary of the magnitude of the epidemic. Objectives We described and compared the pattern of COVID-19 mortality standardized by age between selected states and India from January to November 2020. Methods We initially estimated the Indian population for 2020 using the decadal growth rate from the previous census (2011). This was followed by estimations of crude and age-adjusted mortality rate per million for India and the selected states. We used this information to perform indirect standardization and derive the age-standardized mortality rates for the states for comparison. In addition, we derived a ratio for age-standardized mortality to compare across age groups within the state. We extracted information regarding COVID-19 deaths from the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme special surveillance portal up to November 16, 2020. Results The crude mortality rate of India stands at 88.9 per million population(118,883/1,337,328,910). Age-adjusted mortality rate (per million) was highest for Delhi (300.5) and lowest for Kerala (35.9).The age-standardized mortality rate (per million) for India is (<15 years=1.6, 15-29 years=6.3, 30-44 years=35.9, 45-59 years=198.8, 60-74 years=571.2, & [≥]75 years=931.6). The ratios for age-standardized mortality increase proportionately from 45-59 years age group across all the states. Conclusion There is high COVID-19 mortality not only among the elderly ages, but we also identified heavy impact of COVID-19 on the working population. Therefore, we recommend further evaluation of age-adjusted mortality for all States and inclusion of variables like gender, socio-economic status for standardization while identifying at-risk populations and implementing priority public health actions.

163877,Graphdiyne-based flexible respiration sensors for monitoring human health,2021,"Introduction The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends vaccination against Sars Cov-2 coronavirus to mitigate COVID-19 pandemic. On December 29th, the Argentine Ministry of Health started a vaccination plan with the Sputnik V vaccine emphasizing the registration of the Events Supposedly Attributed to Vaccines and Immunizations (ESAVI) in the National Surveillance System. The aim of this study is to determine the safety of this vaccine. Methods In an ongoing cohort study, health professionals from Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires vaccinated with the first component of the Sputnik V vaccine (a rAd26 vector-based) were followed up. Safety at 72 hs was analysed from a self-report form. Local and systemic reactions were characterized as mild, moderate and severe. Incident rates were calculated per 1000 person-hours by age groups and gender. Adjusted hazard ratio and 95% Confidence Interval (HR; 95%CI) is obtained by Cox Regression Model. Results 707 health professionals (mean age 35, 67% female) were vaccinated, response rate was 96,6% and 71,3% reported at least one ESAVI. Rate was 6.3 per 1.000 person-hours. Among local reactions, 54% reported pain at the injection site, 11% redness and swelling. Among systemic reactions 40% reported fever, 5% diarrhea and 68% new or worsened muscle pain. Five percent had serious adverse events that required medical evaluation and one inpatient. ESAVI rate was higher among females (65.4% vs 50%; HR 1.38, 95%CI 1.13-5.38) and in younger than 55 years-old (72.8% vs 32%; HR 2.66, 95%CI 1.32-1.68). Conclusion Active surveillance on safety for vaccines with emergency approval is mandatory. This study shows high rates of local and systemic reactions however early serious events were rare. Short term safety is supported by these preliminary findings. Studies on long term safety and efficacy, accoding sex and age, are needed.","Pagotto, V.; Ferloni, A.; Soriano, M.

164836,P38 Understanding Food Insecurity in a College Student Population,2021,"In March 2020, universities in Norway and many other countries shut down due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The students lost access to classrooms, libraries, study halls, and laboratories. Studying turned digital. Because it is unclear when this pandemic will cease to affect students and because we cannot know whether or when a new pandemic occurs, we need to find ways to improve digital study-life for students. An important step in this direction is to understand the students' experiences and perspectives regarding how the digitalization affected their study-life both in structured learning arenas and their self-study. Therefore, we interviewed 12 students in an introductory mechanics course at a Norwegian university in June of 2020. Through a thematic analysis, we identified four broad categories in the students' different experiences and reflections, namely that digitalization: (a) provides benefits, e.g. the flexibility inherent in online video lectures;(b) incurs learning costs, e.g. students reducing their study effort;(c) incurs social costs, e.g. missing being around other students;and (d) increases the need for structure, e.g. wanting to be arranged in digital groups to solve mandatory tasks. We also found that the 2019 students on average scored significantly better on the final exam than the 2020 students, d = 0.31, but we discuss why this result should be interpreted with caution. We provide suggestions for how to adapt courses to make students' digital studying more socially stimulating and effective.

Current PyCBC-based searches for compact binary mergers, which matched filter the detector data against a set of template waveforms, have so far detected or confirmed several GW events. However, the sensitivity of these searches to signals arising from mergers of IMBH binaries is not optimal. Here, we present a new optimised PyCBC-based search for such signals. Our search benefits from using a targeted template bank, stricter signal-noise discriminators and a lower matched-filter frequency cut-off. In particular, for a population of simulated signals with isotropically distributed spins, we improve the sensitive volume-time product over previous PyCBC-based searches, at an inverse false alarm rate of 100 years, by a factor of 1.5 to 3 depending on the total binary mass. We deploy this new search on Advanced LIGO-Virgo data from the first half of the third observing run. The search does not identify any new significant IMBH binaries but does confirm the detection of the short-duration GW signal GW190521 with a false alarm rate of 1 in 727 years.","Chandra, Koustav; Villa-Ortega, V.; Dent, T.; McIsaac, C.; Pai, Archana; Harry, I.

168807,Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Sustainable Development Goals: What We Learn from the Past and Where We Are Heading?,2021,"Controversy exists regarding the use of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) during the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Several surgical societies have issued recommendations regarding precaution measures during MIS, nonetheless these recommendations were conflicting with respect to the use of laparoscopy with little or no inference to natural-orifice endoscopic surgery. A comprehensive literature search was performed to explore the available evidence pertinent to the novel coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission dynamics in MIS, and benefits of MIS procedures in patients with transmissible viral diseases. According to the current evidence, SARS-CoV-2 has a multi-route transmission, including fecal-oral transmission. Evidence on airborne transmission in the operative setting are however limited. In addition to nasopharyngeal screening, it would seem prudent to perform routine fecal testing for SARS-CoV-2 in patients undergoing positive-pressure transanal minimally invasive procedures. This is particularly relevant to regions with high level of epidemicity. In patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, conventional laparoscopic and robotic approaches, and atmospheric transanal surgery with high volume smoke evacuation may be safer alternatives. Considering the high rates of postoperative pulmonary complications and mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, use of laparoscopy is advised in suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients who require abdominal surgery, particularly older patients and those with comorbidities. Laparoscopy may decrease the probability of postoperative disease exacerbation, and provide earlier recovery, less morbidity and mortality, and shorter hospital stay with subsequent decreased risk of in-hospital secondary transmission. High index of suspicion in postoperative patients with fever or respiratory symptoms is necessary to timely diagnose COVID-19. Chest computed tomography scan has a higher sensitivity compared to real-time PCR and can potentially be used to assist in the diagnosis, particularly in elderly patients.","Hamid, H. K.

The importance of climate for health is recognised by healthcare professionals, who need to be equipped to deliver environmentally sustainable healthcare and promote planetary health. There is some evidence that climate change and health is not strongly embedded in accredited master-level public health training programs and medical programs globally, however, the immersion of climate-health in Australian and New Zealand programs is unclear. Objectives: To explore the extent to which climate-health education is currently embedded into public health and medical curricula in Australia and New Zealand. Methods: Educators identified by their coordination, convenorship, or delivery into programs of public health and medicine at universities in Australia and New Zealand were invited to participate in a cross-sectional, exploratory mixed methods study. Participants completed an online quantitative survey and qualitative interviews regarding their experience in program and course delivery, and the prominence of climate-health content within program and course delivery. Quantitative surveys were analysed using descriptive statistics and qualitative interview content was analysed via a modified ground theory approach. Results: The response rate of the quantitative survey was 43.7% (21/48). Ten survey respondents also completed qualitative interviews. Quantitative results showed that epidemiologists were the most common experts involved in design and delivery of this curriculum, with a reliance on guest lecturers to provide updated content. Qualitative interviews highlighted the ad-hoc role of Indigenous-led content in this field, the barriers of time and resources to develop a coherent curriculum and the important role of high-level champions to drive the inclusion of climate change and planetary health.

Although research has shown that artificially synthesized nullomers have deleterious effects, there is still a lack of a strategy for the prioritisation and classification of non-occurring sequences as potentially malicious or benign. In this work, by using Markovian models with multiple-testing correction, we reveal significant absent oligomers which are statistically expected to exist. This strongly suggests that their absence is due to negative selection. We survey genomes and proteomes covering the diversity of life, and find thousands of significant absent sequences. Common significant nullomers are often mono- or dinucleotide tracts, or palindromic. Significant viral nullomers are often restriction sites, and may indicate unknown restriction motifs. Surprisingly, significant mammal genome nullomers are often present, but rare, in other mammals, suggesting that they are suppressed but not completely forbidden. Significant human nullomers are rarely present in human viruses, indicating viral mimicry of the host. More than 1/4 of human proteins are one substitution away from containing a significant nullomer.

In this scenario, the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences (SAMW/ASSM) organized guidelines based on expert opinion to identify Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) patients, which often need palliative care (PC) due to a large symptoms burden. In our specialized COVID-19 Center, we investigated characteristics and mortality of DNR patients according to SAMW/ASSM guidelines, comparing to non-DNR patients. Methods: Pilot retrospective validation study, evaluating consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to Internal Medicine Department. A sub-analysis of the deceased patients care was performed, using both Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale-Palliative care (RASS-PAL) for sedation and agitation (+4/-5) and modified Borg Scale for dyspnea (1-10). Primary outcome was a 30-days survival of DNR patients comparing to non-DNR patients. Secondary outcomes reported quality of PC, especially on dyspnea and restlessness. Results: From March 16 to April 1 2020, 213 consecutive patients were triaged; of 40 DNR patients 25 (64%) were males with a mean age of 79.9 years. At 30-days follow-up, 9 (22.5%) of DNR patients died; 4 patients (2.2%) died in the control group. The higher mortality rate in DNR group was further confirmed by Log-Rank Mantel-Cox (23.104, p < 0.0001). PC was applied using oxygen (100%), opioids (100%) and sedatives (89%); the mean RASS-PAL improved from 2.2 to -1.8 (p < 0.0001) and Borg scale improved from 5.7 to 4.7 (p = 0.581). Conclusion: The SAMW/ASSM guidelines identified patients at higher risk of short-term death. In the end-of-life management, an early access to PC becomes crucial, both improving patients' end-of-life treatment and reducing psychological families' post-traumatic disorders.","Lo Presti, G.; Biggiogero, M.; Glotta, A.; Biondi, C.; Horvath, Z.; Leo, R.; Franzetti-Pellanda, A.; Saporito, A.; Ceruti, S.; Capdevila, X.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.12.21260359v1?rss=1,110
172337,Indian Laws during COVID-19 Pandemic: Implications to Health and Management,2021,"Microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC) are plastic, versatile and highly responsive cells, with morphological and functional aspects that uniquely match the tissues they supply. The response of these cells to oxygen oscillations is an essential aspect of tissue homeostasis, and is finely tuned to maintain organ function during physiological and metabolic challenges. Primary MVEC from two continuous capillary networks with distinct organ microenvironments, those of the lung and brain, were pre-conditioned at normal atmospheric (∼ 21 %) and physiological (5 and 10 %) O2 levels, and subsequently used to compare organ-specific MVEC hypoxia response. Brain MVEC preferentially stabilise HIF-2α in response to hypoxia, whereas lung MVEC primarily accumulate HIF-1α; however, this does not result in significant differences at the level of transcriptional activation of hypoxia-induced genes. Glycolytic activity is comparable between brain and lung endothelial cells, and is affected by oxygen pre-conditioning, while glucose uptake is not changed by oxygen pre-conditioning and is observed to be consistently higher in brain MVEC. Conversely, MVEC mitochondrial activity is organ-specific; brain MVEC maintain a higher relative mitochondrial spare capacity at 5% O2, but not following hyperoxic priming. If maintained at supra-physiological O2 levels, both MVEC fail to respond to hypoxia, and have severely compromised and delayed induction of the glycolytic shifts required for survival, an effect which is particularly pronounced in brain MVEC. Oxygen preconditioning also differentially shapes the composition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) in the two MVEC populations. Lung MVEC primed at physioxia have lower levels of all ETC complexes compared to hyperoxia, an effect exacerbated by hypoxia. Conversely, brain MVEC expanded in physioxia display increased complex II (SDH) activity, which is further augmented during hypoxia. SDH activity in brain MVEC primed at 21 % O2 is ablated; upon hypoxia, this results in the accumulation of near-toxic levels of succinate in these cells. Our data suggests that, even though MVEC are primarily glycolytic, mitochondrial integrity in brain MVEC is essential for metabolic responses to hypoxia; these responses are compromised when cells are exposed to supra-physiological levels of oxygen. This work demonstrates that the study of MVEC in normal cell culture environments do not adequately represent physiological parameters found in situ, and show that the unique metabolism and function of organ-specific MVEC can be reprogrammed by external oxygen, significantly affecting the timing and degree of downstream responses. Graphical Abstract In brief Hypoxia sensing by microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC) is organ-specific, and efficacy of response is affected by external oxygen.

173681,"Extraordinary attention, ordinary neglect: the high cost of disaster preparedness and response",2020-10-28,"Due to COVID-19 pandemic, the lockdown effects on air pollution level are undeniable. Several studies around the world have detected an uneven behaviour in tropospheric ozone (O3) concentrations. In this work, Seville (Spain) is used as example of faced to traffic place in which the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is drastically reduced (41%) while O3 has no significant changes. In order to evaluate the existence of differences in O3 behaviour that is not detected by statistical procedures, a multifractal approach was used to assess the coupled scale relationship between NO2 and O3 during the 2020 lockdown against a period reference (2017–2019). For this purpose, the two main coupled multifractal method were employed: multifractal detrended cross-correlation and joint multifractal analysis. While cross-correlation analysis did not detect differences between the cross-correlated fluctuations of NO2 and O3 in the periods analysed, the joint multifractal analysis, based on the partition function and the method of moments, found a loss of variability in O3 during the lockdown. This leads to a loss of multifractal characteristic of O3 time series. The drastically reduction of primary pollutants during the lockdown might be the responsible of the tendency to monofractality in O3 time series. These differences were found for a wide temporal extent ranging from 80 min to ~28 days.","Pavón-Domínguez, Pablo Plocoste Thomas",Atmospheric Research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2021.105755,110

Currently, FFPE sections are limited to low throughput histo- and immunological assessments. Extracting largescale molecular information remains a major technological barrier to uncover the vast potential within FFPE specimens for translation and clinical research. Two critical but understudied facets of glucose metabolism are anabolic pathways for glycogen and N-linked glycan biosynthesis. Together, these complex carbohydrates represent bioenergetics, protein-structure function, and tissue architecture in human biology. Herein, we report the high-dimensional Metabolomics-Assisted Digital pathology Imaging (Madi) workflow that combines matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) with machine learning for the comprehensive assessment of tissue heterogeneity, histopathology, and metabolism in human FFPE sections. In normal human tissue sections, Madi accurately identifies anatomical regions within liver and the brain. In human lung diseases, Madi accurately predicts major lung pathologies such as honeycomb change, late-stage fibrosis, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), and acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and COVID-19 pneumonia specimens with precision. In depth pathway enrichment analyses reveal unique metabolic pathways are associated with distinct pathological regions, which highlight aberrant complex carbohydrate metabolism as a previously unknown molecular event associated with disease progression that could hold key to future therapeutic interventions.","Conroy, Lindsey R; Allison, Derek B; Sun, Qi; Young, Lyndsay EA; Hawkinson, Tara R; Clarke, Harrison A; Ferreira, Juanita E; Hammonds, Autumn V; McDonald, Robert J; Absher, Kimberly J; Alilain, Warren J; Waters, Christopher M; Liu, Jinze; Sun, Ramon C",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.14.448358,110

Due to the labile nature of mRNA, identifying impurities that could affect product stability and efficacy is crucial to the long-term use of nucleic-acid based medicines. Herein reversed phase ion pair high performance liquid chromatography (RP-IP HPLC) was used to identify a class of impurity formed through lipid:mRNA reactions; such reactions are typically undetectable by traditional mRNA purity analytical techniques. The identified modifications render the mRNA untranslatable, leading to loss of protein expression. Specifically, an electrophilic impurity derived from the ionizable cationic lipid component is shown to be responsible. Mechanisms implicated in the formation of reactive species include oxidation and subsequent hydrolysis of the tertiary amine. It thus remains critical to ensure robust analytical methods and stringent manufacturing control to ensure mRNA stability and high activity in LNP delivery systems.","Packer, Meredith; Gyawali, Dipendra; Yerabolu, Ravikiran; Schariter, Joseph; White, Phil",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.21.461221,110

This study examined the association between diaper need and risk for food insecurity in a statewide sample of participants in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Families enrolled in Vermont WIC in August 2019 were invited to an online survey. Generalized linear models were used to estimate the relationship between risk for food insecurity measured by the Hunger Vital Sign tool and diaper need, with and without adjustment for household factors. Follow-up questions asked those with diaper need what they do when they run out of diapers and those without diaper need how they access enough diapers. Complete data were available for 501 households. Over half (52.3%) were at risk for food insecurity and nearly one-third (32.5%) reported diaper need. The odds of experiencing risk for food insecurity were 3.852 (95% CI=2.557, 5.803) times greater for families with diaper need than for families that had enough diapers. The association persisted with adjustment for location, age of respondent, number of children in diapers, and length of time participating in WIC (adjusted OR=4.036, 95% CI=2.645, 6.160). Strategies to avoid running out of diapers included borrowing, stretching supplies, switching to cloth or underwear, and buying on credit. It is possible that public health interventions that address diaper need may reduce food insecurity in households with children.","Belarmino, E.

175338,P109 Responsive Feeding During COVID-19: Evaluation of a Specialized Training for ECE Providers and Stakeholders,2021,"Since December 2019, the world has been facing an emerging infectious disease named coronavirus disease 2019. Thailand has also been affected by the spread of the coronavirus. The Thai government have announced policies to protect people, based on the emergency decree and curfew law for flattening the curve of the number of the coronavirus disease 2019 cases without vaccination in Thailand. This research estimated of the number of total infectious cases of coronavirus disease 2019 in Thailand. Two growth curves, including an exponential growth curve under a non-flattened curve policy (herd immunity policy without vaccination), and a logistic growth curve under a flattened curve policy without vaccination, were selected to estimate the parameters of the curves by the least square method to represent the number of the total infectious cases in Thailand. Moreover, the maximum infectious cases of coronavirus disease 2019 and the speed of spreading for coronavirus disease 2019 in Thailand were also explored. Based on the number of the total infectious cases of coronavirus disease 2019 in Thailand, the findings demonstrated that the coefficient of determination of the logistic growth curve was greater than the exponential growth curve and the root means squared percentage error of the logistic growth curve was less than the exponential growth curve. These results suggest that the logistic growth curve is suitable for describing the number of total infectious cases of coronavirus disease 2019 in Thailand under the fattened curve policy.

By the medical students, for the community: reaching out, beyond the classroom",2020,"Several studies have been conducted to understand the predictors of academic performance of various levels of high school and undergraduate students as quantified by the grade point average. This study focuses specifically on engineering students as they differ from other undergraduate students in their background and expectations. We focus on quantifying essential predictors of the performance of engineering students in an advanced mathematics course. We collected data from 72 participants recruited from engineering students enrolled in the advanced engineering mathematics (AEM) course in a research university. We chose this course to represent a standard engineering mathematics course covering several essential topics. We consider several factors in our analysis, such as cellphone usage and the academic background, e.g., the academic year, number of minors, and majors, performance in prerequisite courses. We perform several regression analyses to understand the effects of cellphone usage, course schedule, and academic background on performance in the AEM course and its prerequisites. In particular, we use the stepwise regression technique using forward selection and backward elimination procedures. We discovered a few interesting findings in this case study. Firstly, for the participants in this study, we find that the daily average “screen time” on their cellphones is not a statistically significant predictor of student performance. This finding contradicts some prior studies on this participant and may indicate adaption and integration of the technology by the new generation of students in recent years. We also found that the lecturing schedule was not an influential factor for their academic performance. These findings are especially relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic, as they suggest that advanced engineering students have adapted to the use of technology and are flexible concerning lecture schedules. Another unexpected finding is that this study brings new evidence that the number of minors taken by the participants is a negative predictor of their grade in the AEM course. This observation may indicate that course-work from non-major classes may adversely impact their performance in mathematical engineering courses. © Copyright © 2021 Athavale, Mondal and Rivera.","Athavale, P.; Mondal, S.; Rivera, S.",Frontiers in Education,https://doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2021.662380,110

The promising target for drug discovery of COVID-19 was SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease (Mpro), that has been successfully crystallized along with its inhibitor. The discovery of peptide-based inhibitors may present better options than small molecules for inhibitor SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Natural compounds have such a wide potential and still few explored, Zizyphus spina-christi is one of the medicinal plants that have many pharmacological activities and contains a peptide compound from alkaloids class, i.e. cyclopeptide alkaloids, that is interesting to explore as SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor. The compound structure was drawn and optimized using density functional theory 3-21G method. The protein chosen was the high resolution of SARS-CoV-2 MPro receptor (1.45 A) with PDB ID: 6WNP, in complex with boceprevir. Molecular docking simulation was performed using Autodock4 with 100 numbers of GA run, the validation methods assessed by RMSD calculation. Furthermore, the prediction of pharmacological activity spectra was carried out using the PASS Prediction server. The results showed RMSD value was 1.98 A, this docking method was valid. The binding energy of all compounds showed better results than the native ligand (Boceprevir). The in silico PASS prediction results indicated that all compounds showed antiviral activity. Some compounds showed protease inhibitory activity, i.e Ambiphibine-H, Franganine, and Mauritine-A, and the highest Pa (Predicted activity) value showed by Mauritine-A compounds. It can be concluded that the cyclopeptide compounds of Zizyphus spina-christi were indicated to have a potential as COVID-19 therapy targeting SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.","Taufik Muhammad, Fakih Ramadhan D. S.

Older people with dementia or those with multimorbidity are more vulnerable to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the development of COVID-19. Given absence of a vaccine or treatment, prevention is the fundamental aspect of COVID-19 control. This requires early identification of contagious people with COVID-19 and isolation keeping them apart from non infected group of people. Early identification of infection in elderly with dementia or functional psychiatric condition is often difficult, due to difficulty in obtaining history or evaluating medical symptoms.Objectives1) To establish the current standards of interventions provided at the unit to control COVID-19, with current recommendation by Government guidance. 2) To address difficulties in early identification of people of COVID-19 in Old Age Psychiatry wards. 3) To introduce sustainable interventions aimed at controlling COVID-19 risk, targeted to this group.MethodsTrust guidance for COVID-19 testing on the ward and guidance of isolation were reviewed. Literature review of currently available scientific evidence for testing for controlling COVID-19 was conducted.ResultsWe have created a bi-weekly mass testing guidance for Old Age Psychiatry inpatient wards with clear guidane of when to start isolation and when to stop isolation.ConclusionsThere is no specific interventions to target older adult within our service currently and it was felt that it is necessary to develop a sustainable mass testing programme for this group of people for control of COVID-19.","Baek, J.; Lennon, S.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.688,110
178127,Job Demands and Negative Outcomes after the Lockdown: The Moderating Role of Stigma towards Italian Supermarket Workers,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 has evolved rapidly towards higher infectivity and partial immune escape over the course of the pandemic. This evolution is driven by the enormous virus population, that has infected close to 200 million people by now. Therefore, cost effective and scalable methods are needed to monitor viral evolution globally. Mutation-specific PCR approaches have become inadequate to distinguish the variety of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants and are unable to detect novel ones. Conversely, whole genome sequencing protocols remain too labor- and cost-intensive to monitor SARS-CoV-2 at the required density. By adapting SARSeq we present a simple, fast, and scalable S-gene tiling pipeline for focused sequencing of the S-gene encoding for the spike protein. This method reports on all sequence positions with known importance for infectivity and immunity, yet scales to >20K samples per run. S-gene tiling is used for nationwide surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 at a density of 10% to 50% of all cases of infection in Austria. SARSeq S-tiling uncovered several infection clusters with variants of concern such as the biggest known cluster of Beta/B.1.351 outside Africa and successfully informed public health measures in a timely manner, allowing their successful implementation. Our close monitoring of mutations further highlighted evolutionary constraints and freedom of the spike protein ectodomain and sheds light on foreseeable evolutionary trajectories.","OÌzkan, E.; Strobl, M.

181260,Government Communication during the Covid-19 Pandemic in Ghana,2021,"Visual perceptual learning (VPL), or improved visual performance after practice, is a behavioral manifestation of the impressive neuroplasticity in the brain. However, its practical effectiveness is limited because improvements are often specific to the trained conditions and require significant time and effort. Thus, it is critical to understand the conditions that promote learning and its transfer. Covert endogenous (voluntary) and exogenous (involuntary) spatial attention help overcome VPL location and feature specificity in neurotypical adults, but whether they can also do so for people with atypical visual development is unknown. This is the first study to investigate the role of exogenous attention during VPL in a special population of adults. Here we show that exogenous attention helps generalize learning beyond trained spatial locations in adults with amblyopia, an ideal population for investigation given their asymmetrically developed, but highly plastic, visual cortex. Our findings provide insight into the mechanisms underlying changes in neuro(a)typical brain plasticity. Further, they reveal that attention can enhance the effectiveness of perceptual learning during rehabilitation of visual disorders.","Roberts, Mariel; Carrasco, Marisa",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.27.441700,110

In total, 92.7% (n=808) out of the entire study cohort, 98.2% (n=325) of those who had been vaccinated once and all 393 individuals who had been vaccinated twice had detectable anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and no significant differences in vaccine-induced immune response were detected between male and female individuals and between different age groups. Vaccinated study participants with detectable anti-NC-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers (n=30) developed generally higher anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers compared to anti-NC-SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals (n=694) (median titer: 7812 vs. 345 BAU/ml, p<0.0001). Furthermore, study participants who received heterologous vaccination with AZD1222 followed by an mRNA vaccine showed markedly higher anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers than individuals who received two doses of an mRNA vaccine or two doses of AZD1222 (median titer: AZD1222 / AZD1222: 1069 BAU/ml, mRNA / mRNA: 1388 BAU/ml, AZD1222/mRNA: 9450 BAU/ml; p<0.0001). Our results demonstrate that infection control interventions were generally effective in preventing nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and that COVID-19 vaccines can elicit strong humoral responses in the majority of a real-world cohort of hospital workers.","Brehm, T.

182302,P115 Updating Website Workflows to Efficiently Meet Changing User Needs During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Ostreobium is a genus of siphonous green algae that lives as an endolith in carbonate substrates under extremely limited light conditions and has recently been gaining attention due to its roles in reef carbonate budgets and its association with reef corals. Knowledge about this genus remains fairly limited due to the scarcity of strains available for physiological studies. Here, we report on 10 strains of Ostreobium isolated from coral skeletons from the Great Barrier Reef. Phenotypic diversity showed differences in the gross morphology and in few structures. Phylogenetic analyses of the tufA and rbcL put the strains in the context of the lineages identified previously through environmental sequencing. The chloroplast genomes of our strains are all around 80k bp in length and show that genome structure is highly conserved, with only a few insertions (some containing putative protein-coding genes) differing between the strains. The addition of these strains from the Great Barrier Reef to our toolkit will help develop Ostreobium as a model species for endolithic growth, low-light photosynthesis and coral-algal associations.","Pasella, Marisa M.; Lee, Ming-Fen Eileen; Marcelino, Vanessa R.; Willis, Anusuya; Verbruggen, Heroen",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.16.453452,110
185091,Impact of zoonoses on human health.,2006,"This work proposes a multimodal approach with which to predict the regional Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by combining historical GDP values with the embodied information in Twitter messages concerning the current economic condition. This proposal is of great interest, since it delivers forecasts at higher frequencies than both the official statistics (published only annually at the regional level in Spain) and the existing unofficial quarterly predictions (which rely on economic indicators that are available only after months of delay). The proposed method is based on a two-stage architecture. In the first stage, a multi-task autoencoder is initially used to obtain a GDP-related representation of tweets, which are then filtered to remove outliers and to obtain the GDP prediction from the consensus of opinions. In a second stage, this result is combined with the historical GDP values of the region using a multimodal network. The method is evaluated in four different regions of Spain using the tweets written by the most relevant economists, politicians, newspapers and institutions in each one. The results show that our approach successfully learns the evolution of the GDP using only historical information and tweets, thus making it possible to provide earlier forecasts about the regional GDP. This method also makes it possible to establish which the most or least influential opinions regarding this prediction are. As an additional exercise, we have assessed how well our method predicted the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Ortega-Bastida, J.; Gallego, A. J.; Rico-Juan, J.

There are numerous problems involved in dengue vaccine development, and there is no vaccine against all four dengue serotypes. Dengue vaccine development using traditional approaches has not been satisfactory in terms of inducing neutralizing antibodies. Recently, these issues were addressed by showing a very good response to inducing neutralizing antibodies by plant-derived dengue vaccine antigens. This indicates the feasibility of using plant-derived vaccine antigens as a low-cost method to combat dengue and other infectious diseases. The application of new methods and strategies such as dendritic cell targeting in cancer therapy, severe acute respiratory syndrome, tuberculosis, human immune deficiency virus, and malaria might play an important role. These new methods are more efficient than traditional protocols. It is expected that in the near future, plant-derived vaccine antigens or antibodies will play an important role in the control of human infectious diseases.","Malabadi, Ravindra B; Ganguly, Advaita; Silva, Jaime A Teixeira da; Parashar, Archana; Suresh, Mavanur R; Sunwoo, Hoon","Journal of pharmacy & pharmaceutical sciences : a publication of the Canadian Society for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Societe canadienne des sciences pharmaceutiques",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22202223/,110

MATERIAL AND METHODS Prospective, multicenter, nested-cohort study. Sixty-one EDs included a random sample of all patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 1 and April 30, 2020. Demographic and baseline health information, including concomitant conditions; clinical characteristics related to the ED visit and complementary test results; and treatments were recorded throughout the episode in the ED. We calculated crude and adjusted odds ratios for risk of in-hospital death and a composite outcome consisting of the following events: intensive care unit admission, orotracheal intubation or mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital death. The logistic regression models were constructed with 3 groups of independent variables: the demographic and baseline health characteristics, clinical characteristics and complementary test results related to the ED episode, and treatments. RESULTS The mean (SD) age of patients was 62 (18) years. Most had high- or low-grade fever, dry cough, dyspnea, and diarrhea. The most common concomitant conditions were cardiovascular diseases, followed by respiratory diseases and cancer. Baseline patient characteristics that showed a direct and independent association with worse outcome (death and the composite outcome) were age and obesity. Clinical variables directly associated with worse outcomes were impaired consciousness and pulmonary crackles; headache was inversely associated with worse outcomes. Complementary test findings that were directly associated with outcomes were bilateral lung infiltrates, lymphopenia, a high platelet count, a D-dimer concentration over 500 mg/dL, and a lactate-dehydrogenase concentration over 250 IU/L in blood. CONCLUSION This profile of the clinical characteristics and comorbidity of patients with COVID-19 treated in EDs helps us predict outcomes and identify cases at risk of exacerbation. The information can facilitate preventive measures and improve outcomes.","Gil-Rodrigo, Adriana; Miró, Òscar; Piñera, Pascual; Burillo-Putze, Guillermo; Jiménez, Sònia; Martín, Alfonso; Martín-Sánchez, Francisco Javier; Jacob, Javier; Guardiola, Josep María; García-Lamberechts, Eric Jorge; Espinosa, Begoña; Martín Mojarro, Enrique; González Tejera, Matilde; Serrano, Leticia; Agüera, Carmen; Soy, Ester; Llauger, Lluís; Juan, María Ángeles; Palau, Anna; Del Arco, Carmen; Rodríguez Miranda, Belén; Maza Vera, María Teresa; Martín Quirós, Alejandro; Tejada de Los Santos, Laura; Ruiz de Lobera, Noemí; Iglesias Vela, Marta; Torres Garate, Raquel; Alquézar-Arbé, Aitor; González Del Castillo, Juan; Llorens, Pere",Emergencias : revista de la Sociedad Espanola de Medicina de Emergencias,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32692000/,110

The objective of this review is to focus on 2019-nCoV emergence, prophylaxis and to predict the treatment approaches. The first case of 2019-nCoV was noted in Wuhan, China. The WHO has announced this epidemic as pandemic. The 2019-nCoV has +ve ssRNA (29903bp), lipid-bilayer envelope spiked with glycoprotein and bears genome sequences similar to bat coronavirus RaTG13. Antiviral agents like Interferon, Darunavir, Ribavirin, Lopinavir, Remdesivir, Chloroquine and Camostat mesylate may be considered for clinical trials. Chinese herbals may be effective against 2019-nCoV. These include Saikosaponins (triterpene glycosides), Amentoflavone, Scutellarein, Myricetin, extracts of Isatis indigotica, and Houttuynia cordata. Another treatment approach is to administer plasma from COVID-19 recovered patients. RNA vaccines, recombinant vector based vaccine and ACE-2 receptor like molecules may be employed for immunization against COVID-19. Moreover, immunity can be boosted against 2019-nCoV by regular exercise. We have checked Thymoquinone as ligand for various targets of 2019-nCoV (receptor binding domain of spike, RNA polymerase, protease, Nsp9 RNA binding protein, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, endoribonuclease) by protein-ligand docking server SwissDoc. Thymoquinone can bind effectively to the targets of 2019-nCoV. Hence, it may be an effective candidate for the treatment of COVID-19.","Rasool, Muhammad Salman; Siddiqui, Fraz; Hassan, Muhammad Akbar; Hafiz, Saleem",Pakistan journal of pharmaceutical sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33824130/,110

197675,Are US jurisdictions prepared to dispense medical countermeasures through open points of dispensing? Findings from a national study.,2015,"The avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a major economic pathogen of domestic poultry that, despite vaccination, causes mortality and significant losses in production. During replication of the RNA genome there is a high frequency of mutation and recombination, which has given rise to many strains of IBV and results in the potential for new and emerging strains. Currently the live-attenuated vaccine gives poor cross-strain immunity. Effective antiviral agents may therefore be advantageous in the treatment of IBV. Lithium chloride (LiCl) is a potent inhibitor of the DNA virus herpes simplex virus but not RNA viruses. The effect of LiCl on the replication of IBV was examined in cell culture using two model cell types; Vero cells, an African Green monkey kidney-derived epithelial cell line; and DF-1 cells, an immortalized chicken embryo fibroblast cell line. When treated with a range of LiCl concentrations, IBV RNA and protein levels and viral progeny production were reduced in a dose-dependent manner in both cell types, and the data indicated that inhibition was a cellular rather than a virucidal effect. Host cell protein synthesis still took place in LiCl-treated cells and the level of a standard cellular housekeeping protein remained unchanged, indicating that the effect of LiCl was specifically against IBV.","Harrison, Sally M; Tarpey, Ian; Rothwell, Lisa; Kaiser, Pete; Hiscox, Julian A",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17479370/,110

Identification of inpatients for safe early discharge (ie, reverse triage) could create additional hospital surge capacity. We sought to develop a disposition classification system that categorises inpatients according to suitability for immediate discharge on the basis of risk tolerance for a subsequent consequential medical event. METHODS We did a warfare analysis laboratory exercise using evidence-based techniques, combined with a consensus process of 39 expert panellists. These panellists were asked to define the categories of a disposition classification system, assign risk tolerance of a consequential medical event to each category, identify critical interventions, and rank each (using a scale of 1-10) according to the likelihood of a resultant consequential medical event if a critical intervention is withdrawn or withheld because of discharge. FINDINGS The panellists unanimously agreed on a five-category disposition classification system. The upper limit of risk tolerance for a consequential medical event in the lowest risk group if discharged early was less than 4%. The next categories had upper limits of risk tolerance of about 12% (IQR 8-15%), 33% (25-50%), 60% (45-80%) and 100% (95-100%), respectively. The expert panellists identified 28 critical interventions with a likelihood of association with a consequential medical event if withdrawn, ranging from 3 to 10 on the 10-point scale. INTERPRETATION The disposition classification system allows conceptual classification of patients for suitable disposition, including those deemed safe for early discharge home during surges in demand. Clinical criteria allowing real-time categorisation of patients are awaited.","Kelen, Gabor D; Kraus, Chadd K; McCarthy, Melissa L; Bass, Eric; Hsu, Edbert B; Li, Guohua; Scheulen, James J; Shahan, Judy B; Brill, Justin D; Green, Gary B",Lancet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17141705/,110
200589,An online international pharmacy summer course during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"The increased expression of genes induced by type I interferon (IFN) is characteristic of viral infections and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We showed that mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein, which normally forms a complex with retinoic acid gene I (RIG-I)-like helicases during viral infection, was activated by oxidative stress independently of RIG-I helicases. We found that chemically generated oxidative stress stimulated the formation of MAVS oligomers, which led to mitochondrial hyperpolarization and decreased adenosine triphosphate production and spare respiratory capacity, responses that were not observed in similarly treated cells lacking MAVS. Peripheral blood lymphocytes of SLE patients also showed spontaneous MAVS oligomerization that correlated with the increased secretion of type I IFN and mitochondrial oxidative stress. Furthermore, inhibition of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoQ prevented MAVS oligomerization and type I IFN production. ROS-dependent MAVS oligomerization and type I IFN production were reduced in cells expressing the MAVS-C79F variant, which occurs in 30% of sub-Saharan Africans and is linked with reduced type I IFN secretion and milder disease in SLE patients. Patients expressing the MAVS-C79F variant also had reduced amounts of oligomerized MAVS in their plasma compared to healthy controls. Together, our findings suggest that oxidative stress-induced MAVS oligomerization in SLE patients may contribute to the type I IFN signature that is characteristic of this syndrome.","Buskiewicz, Iwona A; Montgomery, Theresa; Yasewicz, Elizabeth C; Huber, Sally A; Murphy, Michael P; Hartley, Richard C; Kelly, Ryan; Crow, Mary K; Perl, Andras; Budd, Ralph C; Koenig, Andreas",Science signaling,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27899525/,110
201410,The COVID-19 pandemic as a social stressor: Psychological and psychiatric risk factors (Based on foreign studies),2020,"Laparoscopic ovariectomy was performed in seven tigers with the use of a vessel-sealing device and a three-port technique. A comparison group of seven tigers that underwent traditional ovariohysterectomy was assembled with the use of a medical records search. Mean operative times for laparoscopic ovariectomy were compared to standard ovariohysterectomy, and mean combined laparoscopic incision length compared to standard ovariohysterectomy incision lengths. Significance was set at P < or = 0.05. Mean surgical time for laparoscopic ovariectomy (82 min, range 71-126 min) was significantly shorter than standard ovariohysterectomy surgical time (129 min, range 80-165 min, P = 0.007). Mean combined laparoscopic incision length (8.07 cm, range 3.80-9.50 cm) was significantly shorter than the mean incision length for standard ovariohysterectomy (13.57 cm, range 12.00-20.00 cm, P = 0.009). There were no clinically important complications observed in either group. Laparoscopic ovariectomy has a significantly shorter surgical time and combined incision length compared to standard ovariohysterectomy in tigers, and appears to be a safe and rapid sterilization method for tigers. Equipment cost and the necessity for advanced training may limit its use in some institutions. Further prospective evaluation is warranted to determine whether it is associated with decreased morbidity, mortality, or cost.","Steeil, James C; Sura, Patricia A; Ramsay, Edward C; Reilly, Sabrina; Seddighi, Reza; Whittemore, Jacqueline",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23082520/,110

Methods: A cross sectional study was designed to evaluate patients admitted for vertebral fractures with diagnosis of COVID-19 infection on February and March 2020. Analysis was made based on clinical and laboratory data along with the imaging findings from chest HRCT. Results: Seven patients with spine trauma including five males and two females ranging from 14 to 59 years were diagnosed for COVID-19 infection through CT-scan findings. Except one, all other patients were asymptomatic for COVID-19 at the time of admission. In three cases the COVID diagnosis was made the day after arrival and in others after 10, 14 and 35 days. Five patients were treated surgically among whom four were admitted to ICU soon after the surgery. The mean ICU stay for operated patients were eight days and the mean hospital stay was 22.6 days. Conclusion: Proper diagnosis of COVID-19 is the keystone to protect both patients and health care providers. During the pandemic all admitted patients should be screened for COVID-19 infection. Unnecessary procedures for spine trauma patients should be avoided in order to reduce complications related to surgery and to preserve ICU beds.","Chehrassan, Mohammadreza; Ebrahimpour, Adel; Ghandhari, Hasan; Taheri, Morteza Sanei; Athari, Bahador; Sadighi, Mehrdad; KafiAbadi, Meisam Jafari; Karami, Amin; Zali, Alireza",Arch.

208164,Perceptions and expectations in the university students from adaptation to the virtual teaching triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Inflammation is an obligatory marker of arterial disease, both stemming from the inflammatory activity of cholesterol itself and from well-established molecular mechanisms. Raised progenitor cell recruitment after major events and clonal hematopoiesis related mechanisms have provided an improved understanding of factors regulating inflammatory phenomena. Trials with inflammation antagonists have led to an extensive evaluation of biomarkers such as the high sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP), not exerting a causative role, but frequently indicative of the individual cardiovascular (CV) risk. Aim of this review is to provide indication on the anti-inflammatory profile of agents of general use in CV prevention, i.e. affecting lipids, blood pressure, diabetes as well nutraceuticals such as n-3 fatty acids. A crucial issue in the evaluation of the benefit of the anti-inflammatory activity is the frequent discordance between a beneficial activity on a major risk factor and associated changes of hsCRP, as in the case of statins vs PCSK9 antagonists. In hypertension, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors exert an optimal anti-inflammatory activity, vs the case of sartans. The remarkable preventive activity of SLGT-2 inhibitors in heart failure is not associated with a clear anti-inflammatory mechanism. Finally, icosapent ethyl has been shown to reduce the CV risk in hypertriglyceridemia, with a 27 % reduction of hsCRP. The inflammation-based approach to arterial disease has considerably gained from an improved understanding of the clinical diagnostic strategy and from a better knowledge on the mode of action of numerous agents, including nutraceuticals.","Ruscica, Massimiliano; Corsini, Alberto; Ferri, Nicola; Banach, Maciej; Sirtori, Cesare R",Pharmacol Res,,110

This study was conducted at the Departments of Oncology of four hospitals located in the Verona area in Italy to investigate the psychological consequences of the pandemic on cancer patients under active anticancer treatments. A 13-item ad hoc questionnaire to evaluate the psychological status of patients before and during the pandemic was administered to 474 consecutive subjects in the time frame between April 27th and June 7th 2020. Among the 13 questions, 7 were considered appropriate to elaborate an Emotional Vulnerability Index (EVI) that allows to separate the population in two groups (low versus high emotional vulnerability) according to observed median values. During the emergency period, the feeling of high vulnerability was found in 246 patients (53%) and was significantly associated with the following clinical variables: female gender, being under chemotherapy treatment, age &#8804; 65 years. Compared to the pre-pandemic phase, the feeling of vulnerability was increased in 41 patients (9%), remained stably high in 196 (42%) and, surprisingly, was reduced in 10 patients (2%). Overall, in a population characterized by an high level of emotional vulnerability the pandemic had a marginal impact and only a small proportion of patients reported an increase of their emotional vulnerability.","Pigozzi, Eva; Tregnago, Daniela; Costa, Lucia; Insolda, Jessica; Turati, Enrico; Rimondini, Michela; Donisi, Valeria; Madera, Pietro; Fiorica, Francesco; Giuliani, Jacopo; Greco, Filippo; Mercanti, Anna; Trolese, Annarita; Furlani, Lara; Piacentini, Paolo; Durante, Emilia; Mandarà, Marta; Pilotto, Sara; Avancini, Alice; Trestini, Ilaria; Zaninelli, Marta; Moretti, Francesca; Milella, Michele; Bonetti, Andrea",PLoS One,,110
211279,Sheltering in place and social distancing when the services provided are housing and social support: The COVID-19 health crisis and recovery housing,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic poses a serious global health threat. The rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2 highlights an urgent need to develop effective therapeutics for blocking SARS-CoV-2 infection and spread. Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) is a chief element in host antiviral defense pathways. In this study, we examined the impact of the STING signaling pathway on coronavirus infection using the human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) model. We found that HCoV-OC43 infection did not stimulate the STING signaling pathway, but the activation of STING signaling effectively inhibits HCoV-OC43 infection to a much greater extent than that of type I interferons (IFNs). We also discovered that IRF3, the key STING downstream innate immune effector, is essential for this anticoronavirus activity. In addition, we found that the amidobenzimidazole (ABZI)-based human STING agonist diABZI robustly blocks the infection of not only HCoV-OC43 but also SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, our study identifies the STING signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic target that could be exploited for developing broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics against multiple coronavirus strains in order to face the challenge of future coronavirus outbreaks.IMPORTANCE The highly infectious and lethal SARS-CoV-2 is posing an unprecedented threat to public health. Other coronaviruses are likely to jump from a nonhuman animal to humans in the future. Novel broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics are therefore needed to control known pathogenic coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and its newly mutated variants, as well as future coronavirus outbreaks. STING signaling is a well-established host defense pathway, but its role in coronavirus infection remains unclear. In the present study, we found that activation of the STING signaling pathway robustly inhibits infection of HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2. These results identified the STING pathway as a novel target for controlling the spread of known pathogenic coronaviruses, as well as emerging coronavirus outbreaks.","Liu, Wei; Reyes, Hanako M; Yang, June F; Li, Yize; Stewart, Kathleen M; Basil, Maria C; Lin, Susan M; Katzen, Jeremy; Morrisey, Edward E; Weiss, Susan R; You, Jianxin",J. virol,,110

Machine learning is a powerful method for screening, as it can learn complex structure-property relationships from experimental data and make rapid predictions over virtual libraries. Although molecules are inherently three-dimensional and their biological action typically occurs through supramolecular recognition, most machine learning approaches use a 2D graph representation of molecules as input; few use 3D information, and none take into account the ensemble of conformers accessible to a species. Here we investigate whether the 3D information of multiple conformers can improve molecular property prediction. We introduce a number of new 3D-based models that can take multiple conformers as input to predict drug activity, and find that they learn interpretable weights for each conformer. The new architectures perform significantly better than 2D models, but their performance is just as strong with a single conformer as with many. From this analysis we identify the best 3D architecture and examine its predictions on species without experimental data.","Axelrod, Simon; Gomez-Bombarelli, Rafael",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.08452v1.pdf,110

There are many arbitrators of what constitutes a responsible business and rethinking the United Kingdom’s farm business, post BREXIT, post COVID-19 and in relation to the entrepreneurial orientation (EO) of farmers is timely and essential to tackle crisis, uncertainty and sustain a healthy rural ecosystem. This is an ethnographic study into contextual dualities. Data from one case farm are presented, and findings are triangulated through a grounded thematic data analysis of five in-depth interviews with other farms from the same community. An empirically informed framework is constructed explaining how, through duality, EO is moderated across six themes. The contributions to policy and practice are intertwined. Through identification of moderators of (and for) duality, the rural ecosystem can be better managed through effective policy design and responsible practice at grass roots. Accelerated professionalisation in the agricultural industry involves combining the rich, irreplaceable knowledge of older generations with shaping the values and behaviours of new generations. By synthesising EO with farmer mentality, we theorise and inform how to re-educate future generations in responsible and sustainable farm businesses.","Smith, Anne MJ; Duncan, Peter; Edgar, David; McColl, Julie",Int.

RNA-Seq reveals gene response signatures associated with platelet activation, fully inhibited by baricitinib. Using viral load quantifications and super-resolution microscopy, baricitinib exerts activity rapidly through the inhibition of host proteins (numb associated kinases), uniquely amongst anti-virals. This reveals mechanistic actions of a Janus kinase-1/2 inhibitor targeting viral entry, replication and the cytokine storm, and is associated with beneficial outcomes including in severely ill elderly patients, data that incentivizes further randomized controlled trials.","Stebbing, Justin; Sánchez Nievas, Ginés; Falcone, Marco; Youhanna, Sonia; Richardson, Peter; Ottaviani, Silvia; Shen, Joanne X; Sommerauer, Christian; Tiseo, Giusy; Ghiadoni, Lorenzo; Virdis, Agostino; Monzani, Fabio; Rizos, Luis Romero; Forfori, Francesco; Avendaño-Céspedes, Almudena; De Marco, Salvatore; Carrozzi, Laura; Lena, Fabio; Sánchez-Jurado, Pedro Manuel; Lacerenza, Leonardo Gianluca; Cesira, Nencioni; Caldevilla-Bernardo, David; Perrella, Antonio; Niccoli, Laura; Méndez, Lourdes Sáez; Matarrese, Daniela; Goletti, Delia; Tan, Yee-Joo; Monteil, Vanessa; Dranitsaris, George; Cantini, Fabrizio; Farcomeni, Alessio; Dutta, Shuchismita; Burley, Stephen K; Zhang, Haibo; Pistello, Mauro; Li, William; Mas Romero, Marta; Andrés Pretel, Fernando; Simón-Talero, Rafaela Sánchez; García-Molina, Rafael; Kutter, Claudia; Felce, James H; Nizami, Zehra F; Miklosi, Andras G; Penninger, Josef M; Menichetti, Francesco; Mirazimi, Ali; Abizanda, Pedro; Lauschke, Volker M",Sci.

215935,Erratum: CO² filtration during pneumoperitoneum inflation and deflation in patients undergoing laparoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Background: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is one of the repurposed drugs proposed for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, all the published clinical trials involve oral administration of the drug, although the disease is primarily a respiratory one. Direct inhaled delivery could reduce the side effects associated with oral use and ensure a high concentration of the drug in the lungs. In this study, inhalable HCQ powders were prepared and characterized for potential COVID-19 therapy. Methods: Hydroxychloroquine sulfate (HCQ-sul) was jet milled (JM) followed by conditioning by storage at different relative humidities (43%, 53%, 58%, and 75% RHs) for 7 days. The solid-state properties, including particle morphology and size distribution, crystallinity, and vapor moisture profiles of HCQ-sul samples, were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, laser diffraction, X-ray powder diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, and dynamic water vapor sorption. The aerosol performance of the HCQ-sul powders was assessed using a medium-high resistance Osmohaler coupling to a next-generation impactor (NGI) at a flow rate of 60 L/min. Results: The jet-milled powder showed a volume median diameter of 1.7 µm (span 1.5) and retained the same crystalline form as the raw HCQ-sul. A small amount of amorphous materials was present in the jet-milled HCQ-sul, which was convertible to the stable, crystalline state after conditioning at 53%, 58%, and 75% RH. The recovered fine particle fraction (FPF)recovered and the emitted fine particle fraction (FPFemitted) of the HCQ-sul sample immediately after jet milling and the samples after conditioning at 43%, 53%, and 58% RH were similar at â¼43% and 61%, respectively. In contrast, the sample having conditioned at 75%RH showed lower corresponding values at 33% and 26% respectively, due to the formation of solid bridges caused by excessive moisture. Conclusion: Inhalable crystalline powders of HCQ-sul were successfully prepared, which can be used for clinical testing as a potential inhaled COVID-19 treatment.","Albariqi, Ahmed H; Chang, Rachel Yoon Kyung; Tai, Waiting; Ke, Wei-Ren; Chow, Michael Y T; Tang, Patricia; Kwok, Philip Chi Lip; Chan, Hak-Kim",J. aerosol med. pulm. drug deliv,,110

OBJECTIVES: To determine the predictors of severe COVID-19 disease requiring admission to an ICU by comparing patients who were ICU admitted to non-ICU groups. METHODS: A cohort study was conducted for the laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients who were admitted to six Saudi Ministry of Health's hospitals in Alahsa, between March 1, 2020, and July 30, 2020, by reviewing patient's medical records retrospectively. RESULTS: This cohort included 1014 patients with an overall mean age of 47.2 ± 19.3 years and 582 (57%) were males. A total of 205 (20%) of the hospitalized patients were admitted to the ICU. Hypertension, diabetes and obesity were the most common comorbidities in all study patients (27.2, 19.9, and 9%, respectively). The most prevalent symptoms were cough (47.7%), shortness of breath (35.7%) and fever (34.3%). Compared with non-ICU group, ICU patients had older age (p &#8804; 0.0005) and comprised a higher proportion of the current smokers and had higher respiratory rates (p &#8804; 0.0005), and more percentage of body temperatures in the range of 37.3-38.0 °C (p &#8805; 0.0005); and had more comorbidities including diabetes (p &#8804; 0.0005), hypertension (p &#8805; 0.0005), obesity (p = 0.048), and sickle cell disease (p = 0.039). There were significant differences between the non-ICU and ICU groups for fever, shortness of breath, cough, fatigue, vomiting, dizziness; elevated white blood cells, neutrophils, alanine aminotransferase and alkaline aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and ferritin, and decreased hemoglobin; and proportion of abnormal bilateral chest CT images (p < 0.05). Significant differences were also found for multiple treatments (p < 0.05). ICU patients group had a much higher mortality rate than those with non-ICU admission (p &#8804; 0.0005).

Since COVID-19 is a severe disease associated with a high mortality, clinical trials in this disease should be monitored by a data monitoring committee (DMC), also known as data safety monitoring board (DSMB). DMCs in this indication face a number of challenges including fast recruitment requiring an unusually high frequency of safety reviews, more frequent use of complex designs and virtually no prior experience with the disease. In this paper, we provide a perspective on the work of DMCs for clinical trials of treatments for COVID-19. More specifically, we discuss organizational aspects of setting up and running DMCs for COVID-19 trials, in particular for trials with more complex designs such as platform trials or adaptive designs. Furthermore, statistical aspects of monitoring clinical trials of treatments for COVID-19 are considered. Some recommendations are made regarding the presentation of the data, stopping rules for safety monitoring and the use of external data. The proposed stopping boundaries are assessed in a simulation study motivated by clinical trials in COVID-19.","Mutze, Tobias; Friede, Tim",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.10992v1.pdf,110
222346,Avoiding Labor and Employment Law Claims in the Wake of the COVID-19 Shutdown: Certified Public Accountant,2020,"Importance: Remdesivir demonstrated clinical benefit in a placebo-controlled trial in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but its effect in patients with moderate disease is unknown. Objective: To determine the efficacy of 5 or 10 days of remdesivir treatment compared with standard care on clinical status on day 11 after initiation of treatment. Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized, open-label trial of hospitalized patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and moderate COVID-19 pneumonia (pulmonary infiltrates and room-air oxygen saturation >94%) enrolled from March 15 through April 18, 2020, at 105 hospitals in the United States, Europe, and Asia. The date of final follow-up was May 20, 2020. Interventions: Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a 10-day course of remdesivir (n = 197), a 5-day course of remdesivir (n = 199), or standard care (n = 200). Remdesivir was dosed intravenously at 200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg/d. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was clinical status on day 11 on a 7-point ordinal scale ranging from death (category 1) to discharged (category 7). Differences between remdesivir treatment groups and standard care were calculated using proportional odds models and expressed as odds ratios. An odds ratio greater than 1 indicates difference in clinical status distribution toward category 7 for the remdesivir group vs the standard care group. Results: Among 596 patients who were randomized, 584 began the study and received remdesivir or continued standard care (median age, 57 [interquartile range, 46-66] years; 227 [39%] women; 56% had cardiovascular disease, 42% hypertension, and 40% diabetes), and 533 (91%) completed the trial. Median length of treatment was 5 days for patients in the 5-day remdesivir group and 6 days for patients in the 10-day remdesivir group. On day 11, patients in the 5-day remdesivir group had statistically significantly higher odds of a better clinical status distribution than those receiving standard care (odds ratio, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.09-2.48; P = .02). The clinical status distribution on day 11 between the 10-day remdesivir and standard care groups was not significantly different (P = .18 by Wilcoxon rank sum test). By day 28, 9 patients had died: 2 (1%) in the 5-day remdesivir group, 3 (2%) in the 10-day remdesivir group, and 4 (2%) in the standard care group. Nausea (10% vs 3%), hypokalemia (6% vs 2%), and headache (5% vs 3%) were more frequent among remdesivir-treated patients compared with standard care. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with moderate COVID-19, those randomized to a 10-day course of remdesivir did not have a statistically significant difference in clinical status compared with standard care at 11 days after initiation of treatment. Patients randomized to a 5-day course of remdesivir had a statistically significant difference in clinical status compared with standard care, but the difference was of uncertain clinical importance.

We hypothesised that a reduction in TM occurs with increasing age. This retrospective, cross-sectional, observational study was conducted at Yonsei University Gangnam Severance Hospital between January 2015 and June 2019. We randomly included 250 eyes of 125 patients who underwent anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT). The distance from the scleral spur to Schwalbe's line in patients with normal open anterior chamber angle was measured using AS-OCT. Results were stratified based on patients' age group-&#8804;40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, 71-80, and 81-92 years. Thereafter, the results were compared among the age groups. The mean TM height of the patients was 770.929 ± 76.776 µm. TM height was 853.188 ± 94.117 µm in patients aged &#8804;40 years; it was 815.309 ± 75.723, 798.115 ± 66.040, 770.942 ± 52.774, 726.716 ± 63.979, and 715.968 ± 63.403 µm in patients aged 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, 71-80, and 81-92 years, respectively. The TM height tended to decrease with increasing age (P < 0.001). TM height was significantly shorter in older patients than in younger ones. Therefore, TM height may change with age and may contribute to increased glaucoma risk and prevalence.","Choi, Wungrak; Bae, Hyoung Won; Cho, Hyuna; Kim, Eun Woo; Kim, Chan Yun; Seong, Gong Je",Sci Rep,,110

223982,Select Subcommittee Hearing 'The Urgent Need for a National Plan to Contain the Coronavirus',2020,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2) was spreading rapidly in South Korea at the end of February 2020 following its initial outbreak in China, making Korea the new center of global attention. The role of social media amid the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has often been criticized, but little systematic research has been conducted on this issue. Social media functions as a convenient source of information in pandemic situations. OBJECTIVE: Few infodemiology studies have applied network analysis in conjunction with content analysis. This study investigates information transmission networks and news-sharing behaviors regarding COVID-19 on Twitter in Korea. The real time aggregation of social media data can serve as a starting point for designing strategic messages for health campaigns and establishing an effective communication system during this outbreak. METHODS: Korean COVID-19-related Twitter data were collected on February 29, 2020. Our final sample comprised of 43,832 users and 78,233 relationships on Twitter. We generated four networks in terms of key issues regarding COVID-19 in Korea. This study comparatively investigates how COVID-19-related issues have circulated on Twitter through network analysis. Next, we classified top news channels shared via tweets. Lastly, we conducted a content analysis of news frames used in the top-shared sources. RESULTS: The network analysis suggests that the spread of information was faster in the Coronavirus network than in the other networks (Corona19, Shincheon, and Daegu). People who used the word ""Coronavirus"" communicated more frequently with each other. The spread of information was faster, and the diameter value was lower than for those who used other terms. Many of the news items highlighted the positive roles being played by individuals and groups, directing readers' attention to the crisis. Ethical issues such as deviant behavior among the population and an entertainment frame highlighting celebrity donations also emerged often. There was a significant difference in the use of nonportal (n=14) and portal news (n=26) sites between the four network types. The news frames used in the top sources were similar across the networks (P=.89, 95% CI 0.004-0.006). Tweets containing medically framed news articles (mean 7.571, SD 1.988) were found to be more popular than tweets that included news articles adopting nonmedical frames (mean 5.060, SD 2.904; N=40, P=.03, 95% CI 0.169-4.852). CONCLUSIONS: Most of the popular news on Twitter had nonmedical frames. Nevertheless, the spillover effect of the news articles that delivered medical information about COVID-19 was greater than that of news with nonmedical frames. Social media network analytics cannot replace the work of public health officials; however, monitoring public conversations and media news that propagates rapidly can assist public health professionals in their complex and fast-paced decision-making processes.","Park, Han Woo; Park, Sejung; Chong, Miyoung",J Med Internet Res,,110

224327,Remote Teaching in a Preclinical Phantom Course in Operative Dentistry During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Observational Case Study,2021,"BACKGROUND: The clinical outcomes of patients who decline anti-spike monoclonal antibody therapies for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is not known. Factors associated with the decision to accept or decline the offer for anti-spike monoclonal antibody therapies are not established. This study aimed to identify factors impacting the decision to consent for monoclonal antibody therapies and assess the differences in clinical outcomes of patients who accepted compared to those who declined these therapies. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study enrolled 2820 adult patients who were offered monoclonal antibody therapies, bamlanivimab and casirivimab-imdevimab, for COVID-19 at Mayo Clinic in the Midwest between 11/19/2020 and 12/31/2020. The primary endpoint is the decision to accept or decline monoclonal antibody treatment. Secondary endpoints were patient-level factors that could have impacted the decision to accept treatment (age, gender, race, ethnicity, primary language spoken, and medical comorbidities). The main clinical endpoint was hospitalization within 28 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: 59.1% (n = 1669) chose to accept monoclonal antibody therapy, and 40.9% (n = 1151) chose to decline the offer for treatment. Patients were more likely to accept treatment if they were non-Hispanic White, English speaking, identified a spouse or life partner, had a religious affiliation, and possessed more medical comorbidities. Overall, 28-day hospitalization rate was 2.6% (n = 72/2820) and was higher among those who declined (3.3%) than those who accepted monoclonal antibody therapy (2.0%; Rate Ratio = 0.62, 95% Confidence Interval, 0.39-0.98). CONCLUSIONS: Despite having more comorbidities, patients who accepted monoclonal antibody treatments had a lower rate of hospitalization compared to patients who declined treatment. Several social and cultural factors were associated with the decision to decline therapy, including race, language, ethnicity, and lack of social support. These findings can inform public health efforts to reduce social disparities in the treatment of COVID-19 and increase utilization of monoclonal antibody therapies in high risk populations.","Bierle, Dennis M; Ganesh, Ravindra; Wilker, Caroline G; Hanson, Sara N; Moehnke, Darcie E; Jackson, Tammy A; Ramar, Priya; Rosedahl, Jordan K; Philpot, Lindsey M; Razonable, Raymund R",J Prim Care Community Health,,110

224607,"Evaluation of knowledge, attitude and practice of teledentistry among undergraduate dental students",2020,"INTRODUCTION: During viral pandemics, filtering facepiece (FFP) masks together with eye protection form the essential components of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers. There remain concerns regarding insufficient global supply and imperfect protection offered by currently available PPE strategies. A range of full-face snorkel masks were adapted to accept high grade medical respiratory filters using bespoke-designed 3D-printed connectors. We compared the protection offered by the snorkel to that of standard PPE using a placebo-controlled respirator filtering test as well as a fluorescent droplet deposition experiment. Out of the 56 subjects tested, 42 (75%) passed filtering testing with the snorkel mask compared to 31 (55%) with a FFP3 respirator mask (p = 0.003). Amongst the 43 subjects who were not excluded following a placebo control, 85% passed filtering testing with the snorkel versus to 68% with a FFP3 mask (p = 0.008). Following front and lateral spray of fluorescence liquid particles, the snorkel mask also provided superior protection against droplet deposition within the subject's face, when compared to a standard PPE combination of FFP3 masks and eye protection (3.19x108 versus 6.81x108 fluorescence units, p<0.001). The 3D printable adaptors are available for free download online at https://www.ImperialHackspace.com/COVID-19-Snorkel-Respirator-Project/. CONCLUSION: Full-face snorkel masks adapted as particulate respirators performed better than a standard PPE combination of FFP3 mask and eye protection against aerosol inhalation and droplet deposition. This adaptation is therefore a promising PPE solution for healthcare workers during highly contagious viral outbreaks.","Seligman, Henry; Zaman, Sameer; Pitcher, David S; Shun-Shin, Matthew J; Hepworth Lloyd, Freya; Androschuk, Vitaliy; Sen, Sayan; Al-Lamee, Rasha; Miller, David M; Barnett, Harry W; Haji, Gulam S; Howard, Luke S; Nijjer, Sukhjinder; Mayet, Jamil; Francis, Darrel P; Ces, Oscar; Linton, Nicholas W F; Peters, Nicholas S; Petraco, Ricardo",PLoS One,,110

This study evaluated the efficacy of a prototype nasolaryngoscopy hood (PNLH) during various clinical scenarios that are known to generate aerosols and droplets. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective detection of airborne aerosol generation during clinical simulation while wearing an PNLH. SETTING: Clinical examination room. METHODS: A particle counter was used to calculate the average number of 0.3-µm particles/L detected during various clinical scenarios that included sneezing, nasolaryngoscopy, sneezing during nasolaryngoscopy, and topical spray administration. Experiments were repeated to compare the PNLH versus no protection. During the sneeze experiments, additional measurements with a conventional N95 were documented. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in aerosols detected during sneezing, sneezing during nasolaryngoscopy, and spray administration, as compared with baseline when no patient barrier was used. With the PNLH in place, the level of aerosols returned to comparable baseline levels in each scenario. Of note, routine nasolaryngoscopy did not lead to a statistically significant increase in aerosols. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the PNLH is a safe and effective form of protection that can be used in clinical practice to help mitigate the generation of aerosols during nasolaryngoscopy. While nasolaryngoscopy itself was not shown to produce significant aerosols, the PNLH managed to lessen the aerosol burden during sneezing episodes associated with nasolaryngoscopy.","Plocienniczak, Michal J; Patel, Ravi; Pisegna, Jessica; Grillone, Gregory; Brook, Christopher D",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,110

Moreover, face presentation attack detection (PAD) is crucial to ensure the security of FR systems. In contrast to growing numbers of masked FR studies, the impact of masked attacks on PAD has not been explored. Therefore, we present novel attacks with real masks placed on presentations and attacks with subjects wearing masks to reflect the current real-world situation. Furthermore, this study investigates the effect of masked attacks on PAD performance by using seven state-of-the-art PAD algorithms under intra- and cross-database scenarios. We also evaluate the vulnerability of FR systems on masked attacks.

The contribution is based on an empirical study of the needs assessment in eldercare in Sweden. The article aims to explore needs assessors' conceptions of mental illness amongst older people in relation to intertwining processes of normalisation and organisational and legal constraints. The normalisation principle (NP) proposes that individuals with a disability should have access to the same living conditions as 'others'. The NP can be described as a strategy that highlights equal rights for individuals regardless of their life situation. The main findings are that mental illness is defined by needs assessors on a spectrum of diagnoses from schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder to anxiety and depression. The successful normalisation of mental illness is linked to structural context, attitudes to older people's mental illnesses and ageing, the practise established on a unit and whether needs assessors reproduce ageism or challenge it through the NP by attempting to secure the rights of older people.","Elmersjö, Magdalena; Hansen, Emelie; Victor, Marie Louise",Heal. soc. care community,,110

OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether obesity is associated with worse postural balance and fear of falling in older adults. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 201 older adults, classified as normal weight, overweight, or obese according to BMI. Postural balance was evaluated on stable and unstable surfaces on the Biodex Balance System platform under three visual conditions: with and without visual feedback and with eyes closed. Fear of falling was identified by a dichotomous question and the Falls Efficacy Scale. These data were compared between groups and included in adjusted multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: The study showed no significant differences (pâ¯>â¯0.05) in body oscillations on a stable surface between the three groups. On an unstable surface, the obese older adults exhibited body oscillations from 0.61° [95% CI 0.07, 1.30] to 1.63° [95% CI 0.84, 2.41] greater than those with normal weight in the three visual conditions. The obese older adults also displayed larger mediolateral oscillations with visual feedback (mean difference: 0.50° [95% CI 0.01, 0.98]) as well as greater global oscillations without visual feedback (mean difference of 0.82° [95% CI 0.18, 1.81]) and with progressive instability (mean difference: 0.80° [95% CI 0.05, 1.66]) than the overweight older adults. BMI explained from 6 to 12% of body swings investigated on unstable surface. Obesity was not associated with fear of falling. CONCLUSION: Obesity was associated with reduced postural stability on unstable surfaces but not with fear of falling in older adults.","Garcia, Patrícia Azevedo; Queiroz, Letícia Lopes de; Caetano, Mônica Batista Duarte; Silva, Karla Helena Coelho Vilaça E; Hamu, Tânia Cristina Dias da Silva",Braz. j. phys. ther.

233327,Uncertainty and Risk Are Multidimensional: Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize injuries caused by exercise resistance bands. METHOD: Single-site retrospective case series of patients presenting to the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute emergency room with ocular injuries secondary to exercise resistance bands from March through September 2020. RESULTS: Eleven patients (9 males, 2 females, 14 eyes) were reviewed. Eight patients had a unilateral injury (3 right eyes, 5 left eyes) while 3 had bilateral injuries. Iritis was the most common presentation, seen in all 11 patients, followed by hyphema (9 patients, 82%), and vitreous hemorrhage (4 patients, 36%). Among affected eyes, the mean presenting visual acuity was approximately 20/100, improving to 20/40 on the last follow up (p = 0.06). However, 4 eyes (33%) had vision &#8804;20/60 at last follow up. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise resistance bands can cause a wide spectrum of ocular injuries, some leading to long-term vision loss. As such, we recommend that patients strongly consider using eye protection goggles or glasses while using resistance bands for exercise.","Al-Khersan, Hasenin; Lazzarini, Thomas A; Kunkler, Anne L; Laura, Diana M; Fan, Kenneth C; Zhang, Lily; Redick, David W; Salazar, Humberto; Medert, Charles M; Patel, Nimesh A",Am. j. emerg. med,,110

233726,COVID-19 and Public Policy Imperatives: A Trainee Call to Action,2020,"BACKGROUND: Real-time PCR is recommended to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, PCR availability is restricted in most countries. Rapid diagnostic tests are considered acceptable alternatives, but data are lacking on their performance. We assessed the performance of four antibody-based rapid diagnostic tests and one antigen-based rapid diagnostic test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community in Cameroon. METHODS: In this clinical, prospective, diagnostic accuracy study, we enrolled individuals aged at least 21 years who were either symptomatic and suspected of having COVID-19 or asymptomatic and presented for screening. We tested peripheral blood for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using the Innovita (Biological Technology; Beijing, China), Wondfo (Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech; Guangzhou, China), SD Biosensor (SD Biosensor; Gyeonggi-do, South Korea), and Runkun tests (Runkun Pharmaceutical; Hunan, China), and nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 antigen using the SD Biosensor test. Antigen rapid diagnostic tests were compared with Abbott PCR testing (Abbott; Abbott Park, IL, USA), and antibody rapid diagnostic tests were compared with Biomerieux immunoassays (Biomerieux; Marcy l'Etoile, France). We retrospectively tested two diagnostic algorithms that incorporated rapid diagnostic tests for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients using simulation modelling. FINDINGS: 1195 participants were enrolled in the study. 347 (29%) tested SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive, 223 (19%) rapid diagnostic test antigen-positive, and 478 (40%) rapid diagnostic test antibody-positive. Antigen-based rapid diagnostic test sensitivity was 80·0% (95% CI 71·0-88·0) in the first 7 days after symptom onset, but antibody-based rapid diagnostic tests had only 26·8% sensitivity (18·3-36·8). Antibody rapid diagnostic test sensitivity increased to 76·4% (70·1-82·0) 14 days after symptom onset. Among asymptomatic participants, the sensitivity of antigen-based and antibody-based rapid diagnostic tests were 37·0% (27·0-48·0) and 50·7% (42·2-59·1), respectively. Cohen's &#954; showed substantial agreement between Wondfo antibody rapid diagnostic test and gold-standard ELISA (&#954;=0·76; sensitivity 0·98) and between Biosensor and ELISA (&#954;=0·60; sensitivity 0·94). Innovita (&#954;=0·47; sensitivity 0·93) and Runkun (&#954;=0·43; sensitivity 0·76) showed moderate agreement. An antigen-based retrospective algorithm applied to symptomatic patients showed 94·0% sensitivity and 91·0% specificity in the first 7 days after symptom onset. For asymptomatic participants, the algorithm showed a sensitivity of 34% (95% CI 23·0-44·0) and a specificity of 92·0% (88·0-96·0). INTERPRETATION: Rapid diagnostic tests had good overall sensitivity for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Rapid diagnostic tests could be incorporated into efficient testing algorithms as an alternative to PCR to decrease diagnostic delays and onward viral transmission.

Here, we retrospectively analyzed the impact of COVID-19 on the epidemiologic characteristics of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection among children in Chengdu, one of the largest cities of western China. METHOD: M. pneumoniae infection was diagnosed in 33,345 pediatric patients with respiratory symptoms at the Chengdu Women's & Children's Central Hospital between January 2017 and December 2020, based on a serum antibody titer of &#8805;1:160 measured by the passive agglutination assay. Differences in infection rates were examined by sex, age, and temporal distribution. RESULTS: Two epidemic outbreaks occurred between October-December 2017 and April-December 2019, and two infection peaks were detected in the second and fourth quarters of 2017, 2018, and 2019. Due to the public health response to COVID-19, the number of positive M. pneumoniae cases significantly decreased in the second quarter of 2020. The number of M. pneumoniae infection among children aged 3-6 years was higher than that in other age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Preschool children are more susceptible to M. pneumoniae infection and close contact appears to be the predominant factor favoring pathogen transmission. The public health response to COVID-19 can effectively control the transmission of M. pneumoniae.","Zhang, Ying; Huang, Yijie; Ai, Tao; Luo, Jun; Liu, Hanmin",BMC Pediatr,,110

During the pandemic orthopaedic specialist registrars were redeployed to ""frontline"" specialties occupying non-surgical roles. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on orthopaedic training in the UK is unknown. This paper sought to examine the role of orthopaedic trainees during the COVID-19 and the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on postgraduate orthopaedic education. Methods: A 42-point questionnaire was designed, validated, and disseminated via e-mail and an instant-messaging platform. Results: A total of 101 orthopaedic trainees, representing the four nations (Wales, England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland), completed the questionnaire. Overall, 23.1% (23/101) of trainees were redeployed to non-surgical roles. Of these, 73% (17/23) were redeployed to intensive treatment units (ITUs), 13% (3/23) to A/E, and 13%(3/23%) to general medicine. Of the trainees redeployed to ITU 100%, (17/17) received formal induction. Non-deployed or returning trainees had a significant reduction in sessions. In total, 42.9% (42/101) % of trainees were not timetabled into fracture clinic, 53% (53/101) of trainees had one allocated theatre list per week, and 63.8%(64/101) of trainees did not feel they obtained enough experience in the attached subspecialty and preferred repeating this. Overall, 93% (93/101) of respondents attended at least one weekly online webinar, with 79% (79/101) of trainees rating these as useful or very useful, while 95% (95/101) trainees attended online deanery teaching which was rated as more useful than online webinars (p = 0.005). Conclusion: Orthopaedic specialist trainees occupied an important role during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has had a significant impact on orthopaedic training. It is imperative this is properly understood to ensure orthopaedic specialist trainees achieve competencies set out in the training curriculum.Cite this article: Bone Joint Open 2020;1-11:676-682.","Gonzi, Gianluca; Gwyn, Rhodri; Rooney, Kathryn; Boktor, Joseph; Roy, Kunal; Sciberras, Nadia C; Pullen, Huw; Mohanty, Khitish",Bone Jt Open,,110

In the case of macromolecular protein complexes, which can have a large number of hydrogen bonds giving rise to extensive hydrogen-bond networks, efficient algorithms are required to analyze interactions that could be important for the dynamics and biological function of the complex. We present here a highly efficient, standalone interface designed for analyses of dynamical hydrogen-bond networks of biomolecules and macromolecular complexes. To facilitate a comprehensive description of protein dynamics, the interface includes analyses of hydrophobic interactions. We illustrate the usefulness and workflow of the interface by dissecting the dynamics of the ectodomain of SARS-CoV-2 protein S in its closed conformation. We find that protein S contains numerous local clusters of dynamic hydrogen bonds and identify hydrogen bonds that are sampled persistently. The receptor binding domain of the spike protein hosts only a handful of persistent hydrogen-bond clusters, suggesting structural plasticity. Our data analysis interface is released here for open use.","Siemers, Malte; Bondar, Ana-Nicoleta",J. chem. inf. model,,110

The model considers different levels of COVID-19 transmission during travel, daily arrival rate and total migrant workers. Indian states with significant migrant workers are considered to estimate the rise in confirmed and active COVID-19 cases. It is observed that reduced daily arrival rate of migrant workers can help Uttar Pradesh and Bihar to lower the rise in confirmed and active cases. By the end of May, 2020, the daily arrival rate of migrant workers will have similar effect on Rajasthan. For the daily arrival rate of migrant workers considered, Madhya Pradesh may experience higher rise in confirmed and active cases. Maharashtra, on the other hand, may experience marginal rise in the confirmed and active cases. A stringent policy to screen migrant workers for possible trace COVID-19 virus prior to the travel and stricter isolation norm after reaching the destination state can be helpful in reducing the rise in confirmed and actives cases attributed to the migrant worker transportation.","Maji, Avijit; Sushma, M.

243798,Trust in Government and Social Isolation during the Covid-19 Pandemic: Evidence from Brazil,2021,"BACKGROUND: An infectious disease caused by a new type of coronavirus that can manifest as an acute respiratory infection was discovered in China in mid-December 2019 and soon spread throughout the country and to the rest of the world. Although chest X-rays are the initial imaging technique of choice for low respiratory infections with or without dyspnea, few articles have reported the radiologic findings in children with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical, laboratory, and chest X-ray findings in pediatric patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection attended at our hospital in March 2020. To analyze the frequency of COVID-19 compared to other respiratory infections, and to describe the radiologic manifestations of COVID-19 in pediatric patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This cross-sectional observational study included all children with clinical manifestations of respiratory infection (fever, rhinorrhea, cough, and/or dyspnea) that required chest X-rays in our hospital between March 1 and March 31. RESULTS: A total of 231 pediatric patients (90 (39%) girls and 141 (61%) boys; mean age, 4 y, range 1 month - 16 years) underwent chest X-rays for suspected respiratory infections. Most (88.4%) had mild symptoms; 29.9% had a family member positive for COVID-19 with symptoms similar to those of the patient. Nasal and/or throat swabs were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 with PCR in the 47 (20.3%) children who presented at the emergency department; 3 (6.3%) of these were positive. Microbiological analyses were done in 85 (36.8%) of all patients, finding infections due to pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2 in 30 (35.3%). One of the patients with a PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 had urine infection due to E. coli and blood culture positive for S. viridans. Abnormalities were observed on X-rays in 73.2% of the patients. Peribronchial thickening was the most common abnormal finding, observed in 57% of patients. Parenchymal consolidations were observed in 38.5%, being bilateral in 29.2% and associated with pleural effusion in 3.3%. The interstitial lines were thickened in 7.3%, and 7.3% had ground-glass opacities. CONCLUSION: During March 2020, COVID-19 and other symptomatic respiratory infections were observed. The radiologic pattern of these infections is nonspecific, and chest X-rays alone are insufficient for the diagnosis. Children with clinical manifestations compatible with COVID-19 (with or without PCR confirmation of infection by SARS-CoV-2) had mild symptoms and most did not require admission or invasive mechanical ventilation. In a context of community transmission, the absence of a known epidemiological antecedent should not be a contraindication for PCR to detect SARS-CoV-2.","Aguirre Pascual, E; Coca Robinot, D; Gallego Herrero, C; Navallas Irujo, M; Rasero Ponferrada, M; Pont Vilalta, M",Radiologia,,110
244738,Self-scheduler for dental students booking consultations with faculty during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a new disease that we do not know yet how to treat, is rapidly evolving and has forced us to stay indoors. Surprisingly, a broad range of symptoms has been reported since COVID-19 emergence. Individual variations in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 can be due to non-genetic and genetic factors. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an inherited condition that is associated with an increased risk of liver and lung diseases which may increase susceptibility to COVID-19 infection. At the same time, there could be a possibility of developing non-hereditary AATD. DISCUSSION: In addition to some evidence showing the role of vitamin D deficiency in COVID-19 pathology, it has been recognized that there is a biological link between AAT and vitamin D. Therefore, here we offer a new perspective that lower vitamin D levels in COVID-19 patients can cause acquired AATD that provide a condition with more disease severity and a higher risk of death. As a consequence, COVID-19 individuals with vitamin D deficiency may have a higher risk of morbidity and mortality. CONCLUSION: Therefore, early vitamin D and AAT assessments and optimal interventions could be helpful to prevent severe COVID-19 outcomes.","Shimi, Ghazaleh; Zand, Hamid",Inflamm. res,,110
245164,A Proposed Process for Risk Mitigation During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Why do we adopt new rules, such as social distancing? Although human sciences research stresses the key role of social influence in behaviour change, most COVID-19 campaigns emphasize the disease's medical threat. In a global data set (n = 6,674), we investigated how social influences predict people's adherence to distancing rules during the pandemic. Bayesian regression analyses controlling for stringency of local measures showed that people distanced most when they thought their close social circle did. Such social influence mattered more than people thinking distancing was the right thing to do. People's adherence also aligned with their fellow citizens, but only if they felt deeply bonded with their country. Self-vulnerability to the disease predicted distancing more for people with larger social circles. Collective efficacy and collectivism also significantly predicted distancing. To achieve behavioural change during crises, policymakers must emphasize shared values and harness the social influence of close friends and family.","Tunçgenç, Bahar; El Zein, Marwa; Sulik, Justin; Newson, Martha; Zhao, Yi; Dezecache, Guillaume; Deroy, Ophelia",,,110

As yet there are no reports of transfusion transmission of COVID-19. Haemovigilance findings within a three-month surveillance period during the new coronavirus pandemic are presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Due to great demand and shortage, blood sessions in outpatient facilities were organized during the high prevalence period of COVID-19, alongside a national plan to monitor the evolving public health situation by random molecular screening of high-risk groups of the population. Haemovigilance protocols were implemented as well as surveillance for any COVID-19 case reported post-transfusion. A 14-day quarantine and follow-up molecular and antibody testing of any COVID-19 positive case was obligatory. RESULTS: Post-donation, post-transfusion information and molecular testing of swab samples collected from three asymptomatic donors at risk for COVID-19, revealed the case of an immunosupressed patient who had been transfused with whole blood derived platelets from a donor subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19. The recipient exhibited no symptoms of the disease. Molecular and antibody testing results were negative. CONCLUSION: Haemovigilance provided information supporting the absence of transfusion transmission of COVID-19, thus strengthening the hypothesis that, even if it cannot yet be definitively ruled out, COVID-19 is not transmitted through blood transfusion. As of early June 2020, a perfect test does not exist, therefore haemovigilance along with the implementation of strict proactive measures is crucial to identify eluding asymptomatic individuals and ensure blood safety during the pandemic.","Politis, C; Papadaki, M; Politi, L; Kourti, G; Richardson, C; Asariotou, M; Tsakris, A; Mentis, A",Transfus. clin. biol,,110

Patients and methods: Hospital records of all cases, where lipase levels were measured, and the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test due to SARS-CoV-2 was found positive, were retrospectively investigated. Of 127 COVID-19 patients tested for lipase, 20 (15.7%) had serum lipase levels above the upper laboratory limit. The patient group with the ""high lipase level"" was created from these subjects, and the rest constituted the ""control"" group. Results: While body mass index (BMI) levels were higher in the high lipase group, (p=0.014), the number of those with pre-existing diabetes mellitus (DM) was also found higher in the high lipase group than the controls (p=0.002). The history of DM was detected to increase the risk of developing high lipase level 4.63 times higher. Only two patients were diagnosed with acute pancreatitis (AP). While oxygen saturations on admission (p=0.019) and discharge (p=0.011) were lower in the high lipase group than the controls, amylase (p<0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (p=0.002) and D-dimer (p=0.004) levels were found higher. In addition, more patients required the treatment in intensive care unit in the high lipase group, compared to the controls (p=0.027). Accordingly, time of hospital stay became also prolonged (p=0.003). Conclusions: Pancreatic injuries or even AP may develop during SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in those with pre-existing DM. Monitoring of pancreatic enzymes is important in COVID-19 patients, especially with pre-existing DM.","Akkus, C; Yilmaz, H; Mizrak, S; Adibelli, Z; Akdas, O; Duran, C",Acta Gastroenterol Belg,,110

249156,Braving the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Social media has become increasingly important as a source of information for the public and is widely used for health-related information. The outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has exerted a negative impact on dental practices. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to analyze the nature and diffusion of COVID-19-related oral health information on the Chinese social media site Weibo. METHODS: A total of 15,900 tweets related to oral health and dentistry information from Weibo during the COVID-19 outbreak in China (December 31, 2019, to March 16, 2020) were included in our study. Two researchers coded 1000 of the total tweets in advance, and two main thematic categories with eight subtypes were refined. The included tweets were analyzed over time and geographic region, and coded into eight thematic categories. Additionally, the time distributions of tweets containing information about dental services, needs of dental treatment, and home oral care during the COVID-19 epidemic were further analyzed. RESULTS: People reacted rapidly to the emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 threat to dental services, and a large amount of COVID-19-related oral health information was tweeted on Weibo. The time and geographic distribution of tweets shared similarities with epidemiological data of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Tweets containing home oral care and dental services content were the most frequently exchanged information (n=4803/15,900, 30.20% and n=4478, 28.16%, respectively). Significant differences of public attention were found between various types of bloggers in dental services-related tweets (P<.001), and the tweets from the government and media engaged the most public attention. The distributions of tweets containing information about dental services, needs of dental treatment, and home oral care information dynamically changed with time. CONCLUSIONS: Our study overviewed and analyzed social media data on the dental services and oral health information during the COVID-19 epidemic, thus, providing insights for government organizations, media, and dental professionals to better facilitate oral health communication and efficiently shape public concern through social media when routine dental services are unavailable during an unprecedented event. The study of the nature and distribution of social media can serve as a useful adjunct tool to help make public health policies.","Tao, Zhuo-Ying; Chu, Guang; McGrath, Colman; Hua, Fang; Leung, Yiu Yan; Yang, Wei-Fa; Su, Yu-Xiong",J Med Internet Res,,110

The objective of the present study was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic related lockdown on sleep patterns and sleep quality in adolescents and young adults. METHODS: An online survey was conducted in June 2020 with adolescents and young adults (n = 498) aged 12-25 years. Participants had to answer questions on sleep, first retrospectively, referring to the time prior to the pandemic, and then referring to the time during the pandemic. RESULTS: A pronounced shift towards later sleep combined with an increase in sleep duration was found during the pandemic. However, these changes in sleep habits were more pronounced in adolescents than in young adults and seem to occur mostly during weekdays compared to weekends. During the pandemic, teens also reported an improvement in daytime sleepiness and subjective sleep quality, while young adults reported an increase in sleep difficulties associated with sleep onset difficulties, nocturnal and early morning awakenings, and nightmares. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 related lockdown seems to have had a beneficial effect on sleep in adolescents. In young adults, benefits are not as obvious. These results support that later school start times would be beneficial for adolescents. However, in young adults it could be important to investigate the effects of other situational or interindividual factors (stress, lifestyle habits, employment, etc.).","Ramos Socarras, Laura; Potvin, Jérémie; Forest, Geneviève",Sleep Med,,110

251275,Descriptive characterization of sound levels in an environmental justice city before and during a global pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) disease causes significant morbidity and mortality through increased inflammation and thrombosis. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are states of chronic inflammation and indicate advanced metabolic disease. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this observational study was to characterize the risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 in patients with NAFLD/NASH and evaluate the mitigating effect of various metabolic treatments. SETTING: Retrospective analysis of electronic medical record data of 26,896 adults from a 12-hospital Midwest healthcare system with a positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test from March 1, 2020, to January 26, 2021. METHODS: Variable selection was guided by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method, and multiple imputation was used to account for missing data. Multivariable logistic regression and competing risk models were used to assess the odds of being hospitalized within 45 days of a COVID-19 diagnosis. Analysis assessed the risk of hospitalization among patients with a prescription for metformin and statin use within the 3 months prior to the COVID-19 PCR result, history of home glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) use, and history of metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS). Interactions were assessed by sex and race. RESULTS: A history of NAFLD/NASH was associated with increased odds of admission for COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR], 1.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.57-2.26; P < .001) and mortality (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.45-2.67; P < .001). Each additional year of having NAFLD/NASH was associated with a significant increased risk of being hospitalized for COVID-19 (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.14-1.35; P < .001). NAFLD/NASH increased the risk of hospitalization in men, but not women, and increased the risk of hospitalization in all multiracial/multiethnic subgroups. Medication treatments for metabolic syndrome were associated with significantly reduced risk of admission (OR, .81; 95% CI, .67-.99; P < .001 for home metformin use; OR, .71; 95% CI, .65-.83; P < .001 for home statin use). MBS was associated with a significant decreased risk of admission (OR, .48; 95% CI, .33-.69; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: NAFLD/NASH is a significant risk factor for hospitalization for COVID-19 and appears to account for risk attributed to obesity. Other significant risks include factors associated with socioeconomic status and other co-morbidities, such as history of venous thromboembolism. Treatments for metabolic disease mitigated risks from NAFLD/NASH. More research is needed to confirm the risk associated with visceral adiposity, and patients should be screened for and informed of treatments for metabolic syndrome.","Tignanelli, Christopher J; Bramante, Carolyn T; Dutta, Nirjhar; Tamariz, Leonardo; Usher, Michael G; Ikramuddin, Sayeed",Surg. obes. relat. dis,,110

Therefore, to identify potential therapeutics, an antiviral catalogue of compounds from the CAS registry, a division of the American Chemical Society was evaluated using a pharmacoinformatics approach. A total of 49,431 compounds were initially recovered. After a biological and chemical curation, only 23,575 remained. A machine learning approach was then used to identify potential compounds as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 based on a training dataset of molecular descriptors and fingerprints of known reported compounds to have favorable interactions with SARS-CoV-2. This approach identified 178 compounds, however, a molecular docking analysis revealed only 39 compounds with strong binding to active sites. Downstream molecular analysis of four of these compounds revealed various non-covalent interactions along with simultaneous modulation between ligand and protein active site pockets. The pharmacological profiles of these compounds showed potential drug-likeness properties. Our work provides a list of candidate anti-viral compounds that may be used as a guide for further investigation and therapeutic development against SARS-CoV-2.","García, Rolando; Hussain, Anas; Koduru, Prasad; Atis, Murat; Wilson, Kathleen; Park, Jason Y; Toby, Inimary; Diwa, Kimberly; Vu, Lavang; Ho, Samuel; Adnan, Fajar; Nguyen, Ashley; Cox, Andrew; Kirtek, Timothy; García, Patricia; Li, Yanhui; Jones, Heather; Shi, Guanglu; Green, Allen; Rosenbaum, David",Comput Biol Med,,110
252397,Support for Early Career Female Physician-Scientists as Part of the COVID-19 Recovery Plan,2020,"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has compelled a majority of hospital systems to reduce surgical and procedural volumes in an attempt to preserve resources. Elective surgery and procedures (ESP) resumption has proven to be a calculated risk between COVID-19 exposure and resource depletion and patient morbidity and mortality from surgical deferral. Methods: Within a few days of halting ESP, our 7-hospital (2427 in-patient beds, 26,647 inpatient surgeries) healthcare system developed a multidisciplinary Pivot Plan with the primary outcome of a phased resumption of ESP. The plan entailed the integration of our electronic medical record, order entry automatization, perioperative staff utilization, partnering with primary care providers, and a step-wise COVID-19 testing algorithm based on a pre-determined hierarchy of case acuity and timeliness of patient care. Results: The Pivot Plan was instituted on May 10, 2020. Since then, 22,624 patients have been tested for COVID-19 in anticipation of an ESP; 140 (0.62%) tested positive for COVID-19 and had their procedure deferred. As our testing capability has increased, we have been able to increase our added ESP capacity from 13 cases per day to 531 cases per day. In turn, we have seen the case volume increase by 52%. Conclusion: Our academic healthcare system located in one of the initial COVID - 19 hotspots in the United States has successfully resumed ESP in part due to a receptive and supportive culture, based upon nimbleness, agility, and rapid integration of multiple resources from a cohort of diverse disciplines applied to the perioperative services workflow.","Serrano, Oscar K; Orlando, Rocco; Papasavas, Pavlos; McClure, Mitchell H; Kumar, Ajay; Steinberg, Adam C; Cohen, Jeffrey L; Shichman, Steven J; Singh, Rekhinder K; Sardella, William V; Schipper, Bret M",,,110

258408,Depression Among College Students Due To The COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: There has been growing international interest in performing remote consultations in primary care, particularly amidst the current COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this, the evidence surrounding the safety of remote consultations is inconclusive. The appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing in remote consultations is an important aspect of patient safety that needs to be addressed. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to summarize evidence on the impact of remote consultation in primary care with regard to antibiotic prescribing. METHODS: Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, HMIC, PsycINFO, and CINAHL for literature published since the databases' inception to February 2020. Peer-reviewed studies conducted in primary health care settings were included. All remote consultation types were considered, and studies were required to report any quantitative measure of antibiotic prescribing to be included in this systematic review. Studies were excluded if there were no comparison groups (face-to-face consultations). RESULTS: In total, 12 studies were identified. Of these, 4 studies reported higher antibiotic-prescribing rates, 5 studies reported lower antibiotic-prescribing rates, and 3 studies reported similar antibiotic-prescribing rates in remote consultations compared with face-to-face consultations. Guideline-concordant prescribing was not significantly different between remote and face-to-face consultations for patients with sinusitis, but conflicting results were found for patients with acute respiratory infections. Mixed evidence was found for follow-up visit rates after remote and face-to-face consultations. CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to confidently conclude that remote consulting has a significant impact on antibiotic prescribing in primary care. However, studies indicating higher prescribing rates in remote consultations than in face-to-face consultations are a concern. Further, well-conducted studies are needed to inform safe and appropriate implementation of remote consulting to ensure that there is no unintended impact on antimicrobial resistance.","Han, Seung Min; Greenfield, Geva; Majeed, Azeem; Hayhoe, Benedict",J Med Internet Res,,110

When faced with this new disease, social and physical distancing and quarantine emerged as solutions to reduce virus transmission. This article examines the quality of life (QoL) of the Brazilian population's during this period of isolation, due to the COVID-19 pandemic by analyzing; physical, psychological, social, and economic aspects. An online survey was distributed from 27 May to 14 August of 2020. A total of 1859 surveys were completed. Our results indicate that Brazilians were more affected by economic and social aspects than psychological and physical. Unemployed participants and individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 presented the lowest QoL. Females showed worst QoL scores than males, but having children did not influence the score. Higher educational level was associated with a better perception of QoL. Not following social distancing guidelines presented better scores in the psychological domain than the ones following restrict or partial social distancing rules. This study is the first to evaluate adults' QoL related to the Sars-Cov-2 pandemic in Brazil at a national level. Our data may help health authorities identify the main factors affecting the QoL of the Brazilian population, thereby orientating them to recover after the pandemic.","Teotônio, Isabella; Hecht, Mariana; Castro, Luiz Claudio; Gandolfi, Lenora; Pratesi, Riccardo; Nakano, Eduardo Y; Puppin Zandonadi, Renata; Pratesi, Claudia B",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,110

NPIs require public interest to be successful. In the United States, there is a lack of published research on the factors that influence public interest in COVID-19. Using Google Trends, we examined the US level of public interest in COVID-19 and how it correlated to testing and with other countries. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine how public interest in COVID-19 in the United States changed over time and the key factors that drove this change, such as testing. US public interest in COVID-19 was compared to that in countries that have been more successful in their containment and mitigation strategies. METHODS: In this retrospective study, Google Trends was used to analyze the volume of internet searches within the United States relating to COVID-19, focusing on dates between December 31, 2019, and March 24, 2020. The volume of internet searches related to COVID-19 was compared to that in other countries. RESULTS: Throughout January and February 2020, there was limited search interest in COVID-19 within the United States. Interest declined for the first 21 days of February. A similar decline was seen in geographical regions that were later found to be experiencing undetected community transmission in February. Between March 9 and March 12, 2020, there was a rapid rise in search interest. This rise in search interest was positively correlated with the rise of positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 (6.3, 95% CI -2.9 to 9.7; P<.001). Within the United States, it took 52 days for search interest to rise substantially after the first positive case; in countries with more successful outbreak control, search interest rose in less than 15 days. CONCLUSIONS: Containment and mitigation strategies require public interest to be successful. The initial level of COVID-19 public interest in the United States was limited and even decreased during a time when containment and mitigation strategies were being established. A lack of public interest in COVID-19 existed in the United States when containment and mitigation policies were in place. Based on our analysis, it is clear that US policy makers need to develop novel methods of communicating COVID-19 public health initiatives.","Husain, Iltifat; Briggs, Blake; Lefebvre, Cedric; Cline, David M; Stopyra, Jason P; O039,; Brien, Mary Claire; Vaithi, Ramupriya; Gilmore, Scott; Countryman, Chase",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,110

Innovative use and adaptation of long-term acute care hospitals (LTACHs) can safely and effectively care for patients during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. A framework for the rapid changes, including increasing collaboration with external healthcare organizations, creating new methods for enhanced communication, and modifying processes focused on patient safety and clinical outcomes, is described for a network of 94 LTACHs. When managed and modified correctly, LTACHs can play a vital role in managing the national healthcare pandemic crisis.","Grigonis, Antony M; Mathews, Kusum S; Benka-Coker, Wande O; Dawson, Amanda M; Hammerman, Samuel I",Chest,,110

The medical and scientific community is trying to figure out and adopt effective strategies that can lead to (i) preventing virus expansion; (ii) identifying medications for the management of critical care and reducing rates of mortality; and (iii) finally discovering the highly anticipated vaccine. Nutritional interventions have attained considerable scientific evidence in disease prevention and treatment. The main question, ""What is the role of nutrition and food science in this scenario?"" requires urgent answer as many theories suggesting that specific food or dietary supplements can fight coronavirus infection have received extensive coverage in most popular social media platforms. In this editorial, we focus on some frequent statements on the role of nutrition and food science in the battle against COVID-19, distinguishing between myths and facts. We highlight that social distancing and hygiene precautions are the best practices for reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission. We further underline the importance of nutrition in its wholistic concept, pointing out the risk of unproven dietary options that could lead individuals to weaken effective precautionary measures.","El Ghoch, Marwan; Valerio, Alessandra",J Popul Ther Clin Pharmacol,,110

However, some studies have shown that the immunological memory only lasts three months. Thus, it is imperative to develop pharmacological treatments to cope with COVID-19. Here, the in silico approach by molecular docking, dynamic simulations and quantum biochemistry revealed that ACE2-derived peptides strongly interact with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD domain of spike glycoprotein (S-RBD). ACE2-Dev-PepI, ACE2-Dev-PepII, ACE2-Dev-PepIII and ACE2-Dev-PepIV complexed with S-RBD provoked alterations in the 3D structure of S-RBD, leading to disruption of the correct interaction with the ACE2 receptor, a pivotal step for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This wrong interaction between S-RBD and ACE2 could inhibit the entry of SARS-CoV-2 in cells, and thus virus replication and the establishment of COVID-19 disease. Therefore, we suggest that ACE2-derived peptides can interfere with recognition of ACE2 in human cells by SARS-CoV-2 in vivo. Bioinformatic prediction showed that these peptides have no toxicity or allergenic potential. By using ACE2-derived peptides against SARS-CoV-2, this study points to opportunities for further in vivo research on these peptides, seeking to discover new drugs and entirely new perspectives to treat COVID-19.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore risk factors for mortality and ICU admission in patients with COVID­19, using computed tomography (CT) combined with clinical laboratory data. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID­19 (n = 63) from university hospitals in Tehran, Iran, were included. All patients underwent CT examination. Subsequently, a total CT score and the number of involved lung lobes were calculated and compared against collected laboratory and clinical characteristics. Univariable and multivariable proportional hazard analyses were used to determine the association among CT, laboratory and clinical data, ICU admission, and in­hospital death. RESULTS: By univariable analysis, in­hospital mortality was higher in patients with lower oxygen saturation on admission (below 88%), higher CT scores, and a higher number of lung lobes (more than 4) involved with a diffuse parenchymal pattern. By multivariable analysis, in­hospital mortality was higher in those with oxygen saturation below 88% on admission and a higher number of lung lobes involved with a diffuse parenchymal pattern. The risk of ICU admission was higher in patients with comorbidities (hypertension and ischemic heart disease), arterial oxygen saturation below 88%, and pericardial effusion. CONCLUSIONS: We can identify factors affecting in­hospital death and ICU admission in COVID-19. This can help clinicians to determine which patients are likely to require ICU admission and to inform strategic healthcare planning in critical conditions such as the COVID­19 pandemic.","Sabri, Ali; Davarpanah, Amir H; Mahdavi, Arash; Abrishami, Alireza; Khazaei, Mehdi; Heydari, Saman; Asgari, Reyhane; Nekooghadam, Seyyed Mojtaba; Dobranowski, Julian; Taheri, Morteza Sanei",Pol Arch Intern Med,,110

266582,"Justice, Well-Being, and Civic Duty in the Age of a Pandemic: Why we all Need to Do our bit",2020,"Following the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, several studies have examined the possibility of correlating the virulence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, to the climatic conditions of the involved sites; however, inconclusive results have been generally obtained. Although neither air temperature nor humidity can be independently correlated with virus viability, a strong relationship between SARS-CoV-2 virulence and the specific enthalpy of moist air appears to exist, as confirmed by extensive data analysis. Given this framework, the present study involves a detailed investigation based on the first 20-30 days of the epidemic before public health interventions in 30 selected Italian provinces with rather different climates, here assumed as being representative of what happened in the country from North to South, of the relationship between COVID-19 distributions and the climatic conditions recorded at each site before the pandemic outbreak. Accordingly, a correlating equation between the incidence rate at the early stage of the epidemic and the foregoing average specific enthalpy of atmospheric air was developed, and an enthalpy-based seasonal virulence risk scale was proposed to predict the potential danger of COVID-19 outbreak due to the persistence of weather conditions favorable to SARS-CoV-2 viability. As an early detection tool, an unambiguous risk chart expressed in terms of coupled temperatures and relative humidity (RH) values was provided, showing that safer conditions occur in the case of higher RHs at the highest temperatures, and of lower RHs at the lowest temperatures. Despite the complex determinism and dynamics of the pandemic and the related caveats, the restriction of the study to its early stage allowed the proposed risk scale to result in agreement with the available infectivity data highlighted in the literature for a number of cities around the world.","Spena, Angelo; Palombi, Leonardo; Corcione, Massimo; Quintino, Alessandro; Carestia, Mariachiara; Spena, Vincenzo Andrea",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,110

We performed a systematic review on the oncological effects of delayed surgery for patients with localised or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in the targeted therapy (TT) era. METHOD: The protocol of this review is registered on PROSPERO(CRD42020190882). A comprehensive literature search was performed on Medline, Embase and Cochrane CENTRAL using MeSH terms and keywords for randomised controlled trials and observational studies on the topic. Risks of biases were assessed using the Cochrane RoB tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. For localised RCC, immediate surgery [including partial nephrectomy (PN) and radical nephrectomy (RN)] and delayed surgery [including active surveillance (AS) and delayed intervention (DI)] were compared. For metastatic RCC, upfront versus deferred cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN) were compared. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included for quantitative analysis. Delayed surgery was significantly associated with worse cancer-specific survival (HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.23-2.27, p < 0.01) in T1a RCC, but no significant difference was noted for overall survival. For localised &#8805; T1b RCC, there were insufficient data for meta-analysis and the results from the individual reports were contradictory. For metastatic RCC, upfront TT followed by deferred CN was associated with better overall survival when compared to upfront CN followed by deferred TT (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.43-0.86, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Noting potential selection bias, there is insufficient evidence to support the notion that delayed surgery is safe in localised RCC. For metastatic RCC, upfront TT followed by deferred CN should be considered.","Chan, Vinson Wai-Shun; Tan, Wei Shen; Leow, Jeffrey J; Tan, Wei Phin; Ong, William Lay Keat; Chiu, Peter Ka-Fung; Gurung, Pratik; Pirola, Giacomo Maria; Orecchia, Luca; Liew, Matthew Ping Chao; Lee, Hsiang-Ying; Wang, Yuding; Chen, I-Hsuan Alan; Castellani, Daniele; Wroclawski, Marcelo Langer; Mayor, Nikhil; Sathianathen, Niranjan J; Braga, Isaac; Liu, Zhenbang; Moon, Dora; Tikkinen, Kari; Kamat, Ashish; Meng, Max; Ficarra, Vincenzo; Giannarini, Gianluca; Teoh, Jeremy Yuen-Chun",World j. urol,,110

For children with disabilities and their families, such measures mean a lack of access to the resources they usually have through schools and habilitation or rehabilitation services. Health emergencies, like the current COVID-19 pandemic, require innovative strategies to ensure continuity of care. The objective of this perspective paper is to propose the adoption of two innovative strategies for teleintervention. Methods: The novel strategies include: (1) to apply the principles of the Routines-Based Model beyond the early years of development, and (2) to adopt My Abilities First-which is a novel educational tool promoting an abilities-oriented approach in healthcare encounters. Results: In the context of COVID-19, and using accessible language, the content of the paper highlights what is important for families and individuals with disabilities, and how the proposed novel strategies could be useful delivering remote support.

274972,Collective Bargaining During Times of Crisis: Recommendations from the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Since 2010, General Ophthalmic Services (GOS) legislation and Independent Prescribing (IP) enable community optometrists to manage primary eye conditions. No studies have assessed the effect of IP. We wished to determine the distribution of IP optometrists and associated hospital referral rates across Scotland. METHODS: In 2019, FOI requests (General Optical Council and NHS Education Scotland) identified all registered IP optometrists in Scotland and their registered postcodes. Data regarding community eye examinations and referrals to HES since 2010 were gathered via Information Services Division of NHS Scotland. RESULTS: As of March 2019, there were 278 IP optometrists in Scotland (278/1189; 23.4%). Two hundred eighteen IP optometrists work in 293 practices across 11 of Scotland's 14 health boards. There was a strong correlation (r = +0.96) between population density and number of IP optometrists. Fifty-six percent of IP optometrists work in the two most deprived quintiles. Since IP's introduction, there has been a marked increase in anterior segment supplementary visits (+290%). Optometry referrals to GPs have reduced by 10.5%, but referrals to HES have increased by 118% (to 96,315). There was no correlation between quantity of IP optometrists and referral rates to HES (r = -0.06, 95% CI -0.64 to 0.56, p = 0.86). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first analysis of IP optometrists and associated referral rates in Scotland. Despite good geographical distribution and increased supplementary attendances, optometric referrals to HES have doubled and continue to rise. We propose a ratio of primary, supplementary, non-referral and referral rates to discern the true impact of IP versus non-IP community optometric behaviour.","El-Abiary, Mariam; Loffler, Gunter; Young, David; Strang, Niall; Lockington, David",,,110
276324,Resource allocation during COVID-19: A focus on vulnerable populations,2020,"Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is defined as the spontaneous development of itchy hives and/or angioedema due to known or unknown causes that last for at least 6 weeks. At any given time, CSU is believed to affect 0.5-1% of the global population. Omalizumab (a recombinant, humanized anti-immunoglobulin-E antibody) is the only approved treatment for antihistamine refractory CSU. However, ~ 30% of patients remain symptomatic at licensed doses of omalizumab 150 mg and 300 mg, even after a treatment period of over 6 months. In the recent years, there have been several studies on updosing of the drug, suggesting that the individualized approach for urticaria treatment with omalizumab is useful. In this article, we provide an overview of these studies and the real-world data on omalizumab updosing as it became necessary to obtain complete CSU symptom control in a proportion of patients. Published observational studies (from June 2003 to October 2019) on the updosing of omalizumab in CSU were identified using PubMed and Ovid databases. Reports mainly show that updosing/dose adjustment evaluated with the assessment of disease activity (Urticaria Activity Score) and control (Urticaria Control Test) achieves better clinical response to omalizumab with a good safety profile in a pool of patients with CSU. These real-world data will provide an overview of updosing of omalizumab in CSU and aid in setting informed clinical practice treatment expectations.","Metz, Martin; Vadasz, Zahava; Kocatürk, Emek; Giménez-Arnau, Ana M",Clin. rev. allergy immunol,,110

However, given that modern healthcare has never experienced a pandemic of this magnitude, rapid operationalization of mass testing presents unique challenges. We aim to highlight our experiences and challenges for preoperative SARS-CoV-2 testing. Methods: We describe implementation of widespread screening tools and preoperative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing in a single, academic medical center. Results: As of August 2020, we have been able to achieve an over 90% success rate in preoperative SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing for both outpatient and inpatient procedures. However, there are certain challenges in obtaining high levels of compliance both on individual and institutional levels. Conclusions: Instituting preoperative SARS-CoV-2 testing and maintaining high levels of compliance is possible in the midst of a fluctuating pandemic.","McSwain, Associate Professor Julie R; Bridges, Kathryn H; Wilson, Sylvia H; Heinke, Timothy L; Redding, Amanda T; Clark, Carlee",Perioper Care Oper Room Manag,,110

This study examines factors associated with PrEP awareness and willingness, and identifies perceived barriers to PrEP among PWID. Methods: PWID were interviewed in Los Angeles and San Francisco, CA from 2016 to 2018. We analyzed data from self-reported HIV-negative participants who had injected drugs within the past 6 months (n = 469). Questions on PrEP included awareness, willingness, barriers, and uptake. Multiple logistic regression models of factors associated with awareness of, and willingness to, take PrEP were developed. Descriptive statistics on perceived PrEP barriers are reported. Results: Among HIV-negative PWID, 40% were aware of PrEP, 59% reported willingness to take PrEP, and 2% were currently taking PrEP. In multivariable analysis, PrEP awareness was associated with study site and sexual minority status, higher educational attainment, and HIV testing in the last 6 months. Willingness to take PrEP was associated with self-reported risk (paying sex partner in the last 6 months, sharing drug paraphernalia, and being injected by another PWID) and perceived HIV risk. The most common perceived barriers to PrEP were copays, concerns about increased HIV or sexually transmitted risk with PrEP, and concerns about reduction of medication efficacy without daily use. Conclusion: PrEP awareness among PWID remains inadequate. Willingness to take PrEP was moderate and was most desired by PWID who engaged in high-risk behaviors. Interventions to increase PrEP awareness and willingness, and to facilitate PrEP uptake among PWID are needed.","Walters, Suzan M; Kral, Alex H; Simpson, Kelsey A; Wenger, Lynn; Bluthenthal, Ricky N",Subst Use Misuse,,110

281036,Policy challenges in mitigating the economic fallout from COVID-19 pandemic in Sri Lanka,2020,"BACKGROUND: Several countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic have reported a substantial drop in the number of patients attending the emergency department with acute coronary syndromes and a reduced number of cardiac procedures. We aimed to understand the scale, nature, and duration of changes to admissions for different types of acute coronary syndrome in England and to evaluate whether in-hospital management of patients has been affected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We analysed data on hospital admissions in England for types of acute coronary syndrome from Jan 1, 2019, to May 24, 2020, that were recorded in the Secondary Uses Service Admitted Patient Care database. Admissions were classified as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-STEMI (NSTEMI), myocardial infarction of unknown type, or other acute coronary syndromes (including unstable angina). We identified revascularisation procedures undertaken during these admissions (ie, coronary angiography without percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI], PCI, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery). We calculated the numbers of weekly admissions and procedures undertaken; percentage reductions in weekly admissions and across subgroups were also calculated, with 95% CIs. FINDINGS: Hospital admissions for acute coronary syndrome declined from mid-February, 2020, falling from a 2019 baseline rate of 3017 admissions per week to 1813 per week by the end of March, 2020, a reduction of 40% (95% CI 37-43). This decline was partly reversed during April and May, 2020, such that by the last week of May, 2020, there were 2522 admissions, representing a 16% (95% CI 13-20) reduction from baseline. During the period of declining admissions, there were reductions in the numbers of admissions for all types of acute coronary syndrome, including both STEMI and NSTEMI, but relative and absolute reductions were larger for NSTEMI, with 1267 admissions per week in 2019 and 733 per week by the end of March, 2020, a percent reduction of 42% (95% CI 38-46). In parallel, reductions were recorded in the number of PCI procedures for patients with both STEMI (438 PCI procedures per week in 2019 vs 346 by the end of March, 2020; percent reduction 21%, 95% CI 12-29) and NSTEMI (383 PCI procedures per week in 2019 vs 240 by the end of March, 2020; percent reduction 37%, 29-45). The median length of stay among patients with acute coronary syndrome fell from 4 days (IQR 2-9) in 2019 to 3 days (1-5) by the end of March, 2020. INTERPRETATION: Compared with the weekly average in 2019, there was a substantial reduction in the weekly numbers of patients with acute coronary syndrome who were admitted to hospital in England by the end of March, 2020, which had been partly reversed by the end of May, 2020. The reduced number of admissions during this period is likely to have resulted in increases in out-of-hospital deaths and long-term complications of myocardial infarction and missed opportunities to offer secondary prevention treatment for patients with coronary heart disease. The full extent of the effect of COVID-19 on the management of patients with acute coronary syndrome will continue to be assessed by updating these analyses.

Individuals are either of the severe type or of the asymptomatic type. Only severe types have symptoms when they are infected, and the asymptomatic types can be contagious without knowing it. In the absence of any symptoms, individuals do not know their type and continuously tradeoff the costs and benefits of self-isolation on the basis of their belief of being the severe type. We show that all equilibria of the game involve social interaction, and we characterize the unique equilibrium in which individuals partially self-isolate at each date.

281456,Civic capital and social distancing during the Covid-19 pandemic(☆),2021,"Two-dimensional (2D) porous graphene is attractive as a high-permeability membrane for ionic and molecular separation. Here, we propose a sulfur, nitrogen dual-doped 2D porous graphene (SNPG) nanohybrid by adopting a facile one-step process. The resulting sandwich-like porous nanohybrid features uniform ion-gated nanopores for efficient transport of target heavy metal ions while blocking undesired ions, as well as abundant multi-binding ligands for selectively chelating permeated heavy metal ions. We show from systematic experiments that this SNPG nanohybrid exhibits outstanding selectivity and ability to separate Hg(ii) ions in mixtures with eight other metal ions. An excellent uptake capability (803 mg g-1) and high removal ability (>99%) within the entire pH range of 2-10 can be obtained. Given the specific 2D porous nanostructure and specific binding ligands, SNPG exhibits an ultrahigh separation factor towards Hg(ii) that is up to four orders of magnitude higher than those of Pb(ii), Cd(ii) and Cu(ii) ions, significantly higher than those of most reported adsorbents. These findings provide a new opportunity to develop selective materials and devices for applications such as efficient recognition, extraction and separation of target metal ions in complex aqueous environments.","Tian, Hua; Guo, Jianrong; Pang, Zili; Hu, Minghua; He, Junhui",Nanoscale (Online),,110

Despite being two large European countries of comparable size with good healthcare systems and similar patterns of exposure to Covid-19, Covid-19 related deaths in the UK currently far outnumber those in Germany. This has several reasons, but two explanations stick out: 1. lower long-term investment into healthcare in the UK rendered the NHS more vulnerable to Covid-19; 2. the existence of a well-governed decentralised and partially redundant organisation of healthcare increased resilience in Germany' s healthcare systems, enhancing the ability to adapt in response to unexpected challenges to healthcare.

286453,COVID-19 and Health Code: How Digital Platforms Tackle the Pandemic in China,2020,"Viral infections cause a host of fatal diseases and seriously affect every form of life from bacteria to humans. Although most viral infections can receive appropriate treatment thereby limiting damage to life and livelihood with modern medicine and early diagnosis, new types of viral infections are continuously emerging that need to be properly and timely treated. As time is the most important factor in the progress of many deadly viral diseases, early detection becomes of paramount importance for effective treatment. Aptamers are small oligonucleotide molecules made by the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). Aptamers are characterized by being able to specifically bind to a target, much like antibodies. However, unlike antibodies, aptamers are easily synthesized, modified, and are able to target a wider range of substances, including proteins and carbohydrates. With these advantages in mind, many studies on aptamer-based viral diagnosis and treatments are currently in progress. The use of aptamers for viral diagnosis requires a system that recognizes the binding of viral molecules to aptamers in samples of blood, serum, plasma, or in virus-infected cells. From a therapeutic perspective, aptamers target viral particles or host cell receptors to prevent the interaction between the virus and host cells or target intracellular viral proteins to interrupt the life cycle of the virus within infected cells. In this paper, we review recent attempts to use aptamers for the diagnosis and treatment of various viral infections.","Kim, Tae-Hyeong; Lee, Seong-Wook",Int. j. mol. sci. (Online),,110

290052,The Role Of Readiness To Change Between Transformational Leadership And Performance: Evidence From A Hospital During COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"INTRODUCTION: In the context of a highly contagious virus with only recently approved vaccines and no cure, the key to slowing the spread of the COVID-19 disease and successfully transitioning through the phases of the pandemic, including vaccine uptake, is public adherence to rapidly evolving behaviour-based public health policies. The overall objective of the iCARE Study is to assess public awareness, attitudes, concerns and behavioural responses to COVID-19 public health policies, and their impacts, on people around the world and to link behavioural survey data with policy, mobility and case data to provide behavioural science, data-driven recommendations to governments on how to optimise current policy strategies to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND ANALYSES: The iCARE study (www.icarestudy.com) uses a multiple cross-sectional survey design to capture self-reported information on a variety of COVID-19 related variables from individuals around the globe.

291458,Low Involvement and Ineffective Monitoring Link Mothers’ Work-Family Conflict and Adolescent Self-Control,2020,"Numerous natural phytochemicals such as resveratrol are acknowledged as potent botanical agents in regulating immune responses. However, it is less understood whether such immunomodulatory phytochemicals are appropriate for use as direct treatments in veterinary viral diseases. In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of resveratrol in suppressing vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection. Outbreaks of VSV can cause massive economic loss in poultry and livestock husbandry farming, and VSV treatment is in need of therapeutic development. We utilized a recombinant VSV that expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) to measure viral replication in cells treated with resveratrol. Our findings revealed that resveratrol treatment affords a protective effect, shown by increased viability and reduced viral replication, as indicated by a reduction in fluorescent signals. Additionally, we found that resveratrol inhibition of VSV infection occurs via suppression of the caspase cascade. Structural analysis also indicated that resveratrol potentially interacts with the active sites of caspase-3 and -7, facilitating antiviral activity. The potential effect of resveratrol on reducing VSV infection in vitro suggests that resveratrol should be further investigated as a potential veterinary therapeutic or prophylactic agent.","Shih-Chao, Lin Zhang Xiang Lehman Caitlin W.; Han-Chi, Pan Wen Ya Shiow-Yi Chen",Plants,,110

To develop and validate a scale to stratify risk of 2-day mortality based on data collected during calls to an emergency dispatch center from patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods. Retrospective multicenter study of consecutive patients over the age of 18 years with suspected COVID-19 who were transported from home over the course of 3 months after telephone interviews with dispatchers. We analyzed clinical and epidemiologic variables and comorbidities in relation to death within 2 days of the call. Using data from the development cohort, we built a risk model by means of logistic regression analysis of categorical variables that were independently associated with 2-day mortality. The scale was validated first in a validation cohort in the same province and then in a cohort in a different province. Results. A total of 2320 patients were included. The mean age was 79 years, and 49.8% were women. The overall 2-day mortality rate was 22.6% (376 deaths of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection). The model included the following factors: age, location (rural location as a protective factor), institutionalization, desaturation, lung sounds (rhonchi), and altered mental status. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for death within 2 days was 0.763 (95% CI, 0.725–0.802;P &lt; .001). Mortality in patients at high risk (more than 2.4 points on the scale) was 60%. Conclusions. This risk scale derived from information available to an emergency dispatch center is applicable to patients with suspected COVID-19. It can stratify patients by risk of early death (within 2 days), possibly helping with decision making regarding whether to transport from home or what means of transport to use, and destination.","Martín-Rodríguez, F.; Sanz-García, A.; Iglesias, A.

In this study, we explore whether snapshot data from these processes can admit terse representations. Specifically, using three case studies, we explore whether the data are compressible in the Laplacian-eigenvector basis, in the sense that each snapshot can be approximated well using a (possibly different) small set of basis vectors. The first case study is concerned with a linear consensus model that is subject to a stochastic input at an unknown location; both empirical and formal analyses are used to characterize compressibility. Second, compressibility of state snapshots for a stochastic voter model is assessed via an empirical study. Finally, compressibility is studied for state-level daily COVID-19 positivity-rate data. The three case studies indicate that state snapshots from opinion-evolution and spread processes allow terse representations, which nevertheless capture their rich propagative dynamics.","Roy, Sandip; Xue, Mengran",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15128v1.pdf,110

We have developed a new class of tetravalent, biparatopic therapy, 89C8-ACE2. It combines the specificity of a monoclonal antibody (89C8) that recognizes the relatively conserved N-terminal domain of the viral Spike (S) glycoprotein, and the ectodomain of ACE2, which binds to the receptor-binding domain of S. This molecule shows exceptional performance in vitro, inhibiting the interaction of recombinant S1 to ACE2 and transduction of ACE2-overexpressing cells by S-pseudotyped lentivirus with IC50s substantially below 100 pM, and with potency approximately 100-fold greater than ACE2-Fc itself.

297382,From practitioner to patient - My COVID journey,2020,"Despite the severity of the second wave of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the recent hope for vaccine roll-outs, many public and private institutions are forced to resume their activities subject to ensuring an adequate sterilization of their premises. The existing off-the-shelf drones for such environment sanitization have limited flight-time and payload-carrying capacity. In this paper, we address this challenge by formulating an optimization problem to minimize the energy consumed by drones equipped with ultraviolet-C band (UV-C) panels. To solve this computationally hard problem, we propose several heuristics, such as a randomized path selection algorithm whose solution is further improved with a genetic algorithm-based UV-C drone-based sterilization (UV-CDS) scheduling technique. We consider educational institutions, confronting increasing infections, as an important use-case for the problem. Due to the energy constraint of the drones, the number of drones required for sterilization of the campus is smartly altered for various campus scenarios. The respective energy-efficient paths in the proposed heuristics and our envisioned UV-CDS are estimated for the drones. The performance is evaluated through extensive computer-based simulations which clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of UV-CDS in terms of sub-optimal performance and much faster execution time in contrast with the other methods.

Currently, many assays have been developed to meet the huge testing requirements and the availability of diverse detection settings. However, few methods emphasize the capability to simultaneously detect two genes in a single test, which is a key measure to improve detection accuracy, as adopted by the gold standard RT-qPCR method. Herein, we developed a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated triple-line lateral flow assay (TL-LFA) combined with multiplex reverse transcription-recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) for rapid and simultaneous dual-gene detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a single strip test. This assay is characterized by the detection of envelope (E) and open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) genes from cell-cultured SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA standards, showing a sensitivity of 100 RNA copies per reaction (25 µL). Furthermore, dual-gene analysis of 64 nasopharyngeal swab clinical samples showed 100% negative predictive agreement (NPA) and 97.14% positive predictive agreement (PPA).

299988,Couples’ Changing Work Patterns in the United Kingdom and the United States during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: By the end of 2019 the sudden outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a global threat. It is called COVID-19 because it was caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) in 2019. A total of 1.9 M deaths and 87.9 M cases have been reported all over the world where 49M cases have recovered so far. Scientists are working hard to find chemotherapeutics and vaccines for COVID-19. Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 have been observed in a combination of several hazardous stresses, making them more resistant and beneficial. So to break down the viral system, the disease targets are examined. OBJECTIVE: In today's review, a comprehensive study of spike protein explains the main purpose of the novel coronavirus and how to prevent the spread of the disease virus, cross-transmission from infected to a healthy person. METHOD: Covid-19 has already been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) due to global death and wide illness. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious. However, the intermediate host of the novel coronavirus is not clear. To explore the mechanisms of disease, one of the viral targets, such as the spike protein that binds to human cells and causes the disease and its genetic structure, is considered with potential inhibitors. RESULTS: It has been shown that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein of SARS- CoV-2 spike and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) host receptor interact and further replication of coronavirus spike protein causes its invasion in the host cell. The human Lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, Locus E (LY6E) inhibits the entry of CoV into host cells by interfering with the human gene, spike protein-mediated membrane fusion. Some natural formulations have also been shown to prevent spike protein from binding to the host cell. CONCLUSION: With the development of the LY6E gene activator that can inhibit spike protein-ACE2-mediated membrane fusion, new opportunities for SARS-CoV-2 treatment may emerge. Existing antiviral fusion inhibitors and natural compounds targeting spike resistance can serve as a template for further SARS-CoV-2 drug formulation.","Nandi, Sisir; Roy, Harekrishna; Gummadi, Asha; Saxena, Anil",Current drug targets (Print),,110

After the initial coronavirus surge in New York City, a 68-year-old man developed progressive lower extremity weakness and a defined sensory level at the lower abdomen. He had highly elevated SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies despite an absence of preceding COVID-19 symptoms. Serial electrodiagnostic testing revealed absent lower extremity late responses, with otherwise normal distal sensorimotor conductions. Electromyography revealed active neurogenic changes and reduced motor unit recruitment in the L3-L4 myotomes. Treatment with methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin was followed by minimal clinical improvement but re-emergence of the lower extremity late responses on electrodiagnostic testing. We report here, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of suspected COVID-19-associated Elsberg syndrome, which expands the spectrum of neuromuscular manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and sheds light on ways to approach diagnostic and treatment options for these patients.","Abrams, Rory M C; Desland, Fiona; Lehrer, Helaina; Yeung, Anne; Tse, Winona; Young, James J; Mendu, Damodara R; Vickrey, Barbara G; Shin, Susan C",J Clin Neuromuscul Dis,,110

306593,Microsurgery at Home during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Do-It-Yourself Toolkit,2021,"BACKGROUND: Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (iCBT) interventions have the potential to help individuals with depression, regardless of time and location. Yet, limited information exists on the longer-term (>6 months) effects of iCBT and adherence to these interventions. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the longitudinal (12 months) effectiveness of a fully automated, self-guided iCBT intervention called Thrive, designed to enhance engagement with a rural population of adults with depression symptoms. The secondary aim was to determine whether the program adherence enhanced the effectiveness of the Thrive intervention. METHODS: We analyzed data from 181 adults who used the Thrive intervention. Using self-reports, participants were evaluated at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months for the primary outcome of depression symptom severity using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scale and secondary outcome measures, namely, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) scores, Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) scores, Conner-Davidson Resilience Scale-10 (CD-RISC-10) scores, and suicidal ideation (ninth item of the PHQ-9 scale) scores. The Thrive program adherence was measured using the numbers of program logins, page views, and lessons completed. RESULTS: The assessment response rates for 8-week, 6-month, and 12-month outcomes were 58.6% (106/181), 50.3% (91/181), and 51.4% (93/181), respectively. By 8 weeks, significant improvements were observed for all outcome measures. These improvements were maintained at 12 months with mean reductions in severities of depression (mean -6.5; P<.001) and anxiety symptoms (mean -4.3; P<.001). Improvements were also observed in work and social functioning (mean -6.9; P<.001) and resilience (mean 4.3; P<.001). Marked decreases were observed in suicidal ideation (PHQ-9 ninth item score >1) at 6 months (16.5%) and 12 months (17.2%) compared to baseline (39.8%) (P<.001). In regard to the program adherence, cumulative counts of page views and lessons completed were significantly related to lower PHQ-9, GAD-7, and WSAS scores and higher CD-RISC-10 scores (all P values <.001 with an exception of page views with WSAS for which P value was .02). CONCLUSIONS: The Thrive intervention was effective at reducing depression and anxiety symptom severity and improving functioning and resilience among a population of adults from mostly rural communities in the United States. These gains were maintained at 1 year. Program adherence, measured by the number of logins and lessons completed, indicates that users who engage more with the program benefit more from the intervention.

One month after lockdown commenced (T2), we assessed 30 psychological and behavioural traits in more than 4000 twins in their mid-twenties and compared their responses to the same traits assessed in 2018 (T1). Mean changes from T1 to T2 were modest and inconsistent. Contrary to the hypothesis that major environmental changes related to COVID-19 would result in increased variance in psychological and behavioural traits, we found that the magnitude of individual differences did not change from T1 to T2. Twin analyses revealed that while genetic factors accounted for about half of the reliable variance at T1 and T2, they only accounted for ~ 15% of individual differences in change from T1 to T2, and that nonshared environmental factors played a major role in psychological and behavioural changes. Shared environmental influences had negligible impact on T1, T2 or T2 change. Genetic factors correlated on average .86 between T1 and T2 and accounted for over half of the phenotypic stability, as would be expected for a 2-year interval even without the major disruption of lockdown. We conclude that the first month of lockdown has not resulted in major psychological or attitudinal shifts in young adults, nor in major changes in the genetic and environmental origins of these traits. Genetic influences on the modest psychological and behavioural changes are likely to be the result of gene-environment correlation not interaction.","Rimfeld, Kaili; Malanchini, Margherita; Allegrini, Andrea G; Packer, Amy E; McMillan, Andrew; Ogden, Rachel; Webster, Louise; Shakeshaft, Nicholas G; Schofield, Kerry L; Pingault, Jean-Baptiste; Stringaris, Argyris; von Stumm, Sophie; Plomin, Robert",Behav Genet,,110

315690,The COVID-19 pandemic crisis and the personalization of the government in Italy,2021,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the population of affected areas in multiple dimensions. Adolescents have been especially affected with school closure and home confinement. The impact of the pandemic on sleep habits and quality of sleep and quality of life among adolescents have not been adequately characterized. We hypothesized that the COVID-19 pandemic induced an evening shift of the daily rhythm among adolescents and adversely affected sleep quality and quality of life of high school students. METHODS: Students were questioned about their usual bed and wake-up times and answered the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index Questionnaire (PSQI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the Morning-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire (WHOQOL) before and during the pandemic. RESULTS: Ninety-four students (64% females, aged 15+1 years) participated in both phases of the study. Students delayed bed and wake-up times in 1.5[0.5-2.0] and 2.0[1.5-2.5]h, respectively. Chronotype (MEQ) shifted towards eveningness during the pandemic. Sleep duration increased and quality of sleep (PSQI) improved only among those students with shorter sleep duration before the pandemic. During the pandemic, the physical and psychological domains of WHOQOL worsened but the environmental domain improved as compared to the study before the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: High school students delayed bed and wake-up times and shifted chronotype towards eveningness during the COVID-19 pandemic. The worsening of the physical and psychological WHOQOL domains and improvement of the environmental domain highlights the conflicting experiences that high school students are facing during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Genta, Felipe Dias; Rodrigues Neto, Guilherme Brito; Velletri Sunfeld, João Pedro; Porto, João Fabio; Xavier, Andressa Dallago; Moreno, Claudia R C; Lorenzi-Filho, Geraldo; Genta, Pedro Rodrigues",J. clin. sleep med,,110

Snowballing searches and expert' consultations also took place. Two independent reviewers were used for the screenings and data extractions. Of 1027 references, 58 were included, 15 of which were empirical articles. The thematic analysis showed that: (1) People with disabilities living in residential or long-term care facilities were more likely to have greater infection rates; (2) Intersecting mediators of greater infection risks were multiple (e.g., lack of accessible information); (3) People with disabilities often face greater health problems when infected; and (4) Unethical disadvantages in the rationing of lifesaving and critical care can be experienced by people with disabilities. Conclusions: Beyond any health-related vulnerabilities (e.g., comorbidity rates), multiple yet modifiable environmental factors can provide disproportionate health risks and consequences of a COVID-19 infection for people with disabilities.

In particular, the early death cases occurred primarily in older people with a frailty status, possibly due to a weaker immune system fostering faster progression of the viral infection. Frailty is an age-related multidimensional clinical condition defined as a non-specific state of vulnerability, identifying older people at increased risk of falls, institutionalization, hospitalization, disability, dementia, and death. Among frailty phenotypes, social frailty has been least studied. It considers the role of socioeconomic context as a vulnerability status later in life. COVID-19 does not affect all populations equally, and social inequalities contribute to drive the spread of infections. It was known that the perception of social isolation, e.g., loneliness, affects mental and physical health, but the implicated molecular mechanisms, also related to the immune system, and its associated cognitive and health-related sequelae, are poorly understood. The increasing psychological distress derived by prolonged exposure to stress due to the lockdown scenario, and the reduced sources of support, contributed to making heavy demands on personal resources, i.e., self-efficacy and interpersonal variables. So, perceived loneliness may be a factor associated with psychological distress and an outcome in itself. In the COVID-19 pandemic era, a correct assessment of social frailty may be essential in terms of the prevention of late-life neuropsychiatric disorders.","Lozupone, Madia; La Montagna, Maddalena; Di Gioia, Ilaria; Sardone, Rodolfo; Resta, Emanuela; Daniele, Antonio; Giannelli, Gianluigi; Bellomo, Antonello; Panza, Francesco",Front Psychiatry,,110

Cardiovascular sequelae of COVID-19 include heart failure, cardiomyopathy, acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmias, and venous thromboembolism. This article aims to collect scientific evidence by exploiting PubMed, Scopus, and Pedro databases to highlight the cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 and to define the physiotherapy treatment recommended for these patients. Exercise training (ET), an important part of cardiac rehabilitation, is a powerful tool in physiotherapy, capable of inducing significant changes in the cardiovascular system and functional in the recovery of endothelial dysfunction and for the containment of thromboembolic complications. In conclusion, due to the wide variety of possible exercise programs that can be obtained by combining intensity, duration, and speed in various ways, and by adjusting the program based on continuous patient monitoring, exercise training is well suited to the treatment of post-COVID patients with an impaired cardiovascular system of various degrees.","Calabrese, Mariaconsiglia; Garofano, Marina; Palumbo, Roberta; Di Pietro, Paola; Izzo, Carmine; Damato, Antonio; Venturini, Eleonora; Iesu, Severino; Virtuoso, Nicola; Strianese, Andrea; Ciccarelli, Michele; Galasso, Gennaro; Vecchione, Carmine",,,110

However, the extent and nature of changes in health care utilization during the pandemic may differ by care setting. Knowledge of the impact of the pandemic on health care utilization is important to health care organizations and policy makers. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are (1) to evaluate changes in in-person health care utilization and telehealth visits during the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) to assess the difference in changes in health care utilization between the pandemic year 2020 and the prepandemic year 2019. METHODS: We retrospectively assembled a cohort consisting of members of a large integrated health care organization, who were enrolled between January 6 and November 2, 2019 (prepandemic year), and between January 5 and October 31, 2020 (pandemic year). The rates of visits were calculated weekly for four settings: inpatient, emergency department (ED), outpatient, and telehealth. Using Poisson models, we assessed the impact of the pandemic on health care utilization during the early days of the pandemic and conducted difference-in-deference (DID) analyses to measure the changes in health care utilization, adjusting for the trend of health care utilization in the prepandemic year. RESULTS: In the early days of the pandemic, we observed significant reductions in inpatient, ED, and outpatient utilization (by 30.2%, 37.0%, and 80.9%, respectively). By contrast, there was a 4-fold increase in telehealth visits between weeks 8 (February 23) and 12 (March 22) in 2020. DID analyses revealed that after adjusting for prepandemic secular trends, the reductions in inpatient, ED, and outpatient visit rates in the early days of the pandemic were 1.6, 8.9, and 367.2 visits per 100 person-years (P<.001), respectively, while the increase in telehealth visits was 272.9 visits per 100 person-years (P<.001). Further analyses suggested that the increase in telehealth visits offset the reduction in outpatient visits by week 26 (June 28, 2020). CONCLUSIONS: In-person health care utilization decreased drastically during the early period of the pandemic, but there was a corresponding increase in telehealth visits during the same period. By end-June 2020, the combined outpatient and telehealth visits had recovered to prepandemic levels.","Xu, Stanley; Glenn, Sungching; Sy, Lina; Qian, Lei; Hong, Vennis; Ryan, Denison S; Jacobsen, Steven",J Med Internet Res,,110

A recent study found that the rates of diagnoses per 100,000 children for the 12 childhood infectious diseases were significantly lower after social distancing was instituted. The largest declines were in respiratory illness including influenza (99.5%), croup (96.5%), and bronchiolitis (92.9%). The smallest decreases were in skin and soft tissue infections and urinary tract infections (35% for each). However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that the immunization rates for American children have dramatically decreased since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As social distancing is relaxed, children who are not protected by vaccines will be more vulnerable to serious diseases such as measles and whooping cough.

Because COVID-19 and influenza have similar means of transmission, NPIs targeting COVID-19 may also affect influenza transmission. In this study, the extent to which NPIs targeting COVID-19 have affected seasonal influenza transmission was explored. Indicators of seasonal influenza activity in the epidemiological year 2019-2020 were compared with those in 2017-2018 and 2018-2019. The incidence rate of seasonal influenza reduced by 64% in 2019-2020 (P < .001). These findings suggest that NPIs aimed at controlling COVID-19 significantly reduced seasonal influenza transmission in China.","Lei, Hao; Xu, Modi; Wang, Xiao; Xie, Yu; Du, Xiangjun; Chen, Tao; Yang, Lei; Wang, Dayan; Shu, Yuelong",J Infect Dis,,110

This study analyzed the factors that improved the air quality in cities in the Guanzhong region of China–in terms of meteorology and controlling emissions–following the implementation of the “Action Plan for Air Pollution Prevention and Control” in 2013. The average air quality index (AQI) values, PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, and NO2 in these cities in 2020 decreased by 45.1%, 43.8%, 82.9%, 57.3%, and 31.6%, respectively, compared to the values in 2014, while the O3 concentration increased by 16.7%. During the COVID-19 pandemic of February to May 2020, lockdown measures in cities in Guanzhong resulted in reductions of approximately 18.4%, 24.2%, and 17.9% in the AQI, PM2.5, and PM10 concentrations compared to the same period in 2019. Principal component analysis showed that the yearly reduction in AQI in cities in Guanzhong was attributed mainly to reductions in industrial emissions, followed by reductions in emissions from homes and motor vehicle exhausts. We propose the strengthening of measures to control particulate matter, O3 and greenhouse gas to see the improvement of air quality among this region in the future.","Zhao, Huiyizhe Niu Zhenchuan Feng Xue",Urban Climate,,110

BACKGROUND: Much knowledge is available concerning change in complex cognitive capacities under the effects of thermal stress. Our science can inform critical care facilities as to remediation strategies such as work-rest schedules to minimize performance error in highly cognitively demanding circumstances such as intensive care units. METHOD: The present exposition draws from the state-of-the-art understanding concerning thermal stress effects on cognition and workload in complex and demanding tasks. RESULTS: The summation and synthesis of HF/E findings provides important insights into combinatorial effects of forms of stress, typically dealt with only as discrete sources in traditional standards and regulations. The identified interaction between ascending thermal stress and cognitive task demand provides an instance of the plurality of ways HF/E can specify performance limitations in safety-critical circumstances, as witnessed in the current pandemic. CONCLUSION: Accumulated HF/E insights provide systematic ways in which to address and ameliorate the combined forces of physical and cognitive stress on medical personnel constrained to use varying forms of PPE. These principles extend beyond this specific domain to all who are required to work in differential and isolated microclimates. APPLICATION: To minimize the possibility of critical and life-threatening error in intensive care facilities which necessitate PPE use, we need principled work-rest ratio and heat stress mitigation guidance. To promote health, we need to champion healthy work practices in our health workers. HF/E insights can help achieve this important goal.","Hancock, P A",Hum Factors,,110

This retrospective, multicenter, observational study included patients aged over 15 years with VT, concomitant blood eosinophilia &#8805; 1G/L and without any other moderate-to-strong contributing factors for VT. Fifty-four patients were included. VT was the initial manifestation of eosinophil-related disease in 29 (54%) patients and included pulmonary embolism (52%), deep venous thrombosis (37%), hepatic (11%) and portal vein (9%) thromboses. The median [IQR] absolute eosinophil count at VT onset was 3.3G/L [1.6-7.4]. Underlying eosinophil-related diseases included FIP1L1-PDGFRA-associated chronic myeloid neoplasm (n = 4), Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (n = 9), lymphocytic (n = 1) and idiopathic (n = 29) variants of hypereosinophilic syndrome. After a median [IQR] follow-up of 24 [10-62] months, 7 (13%) patients had a recurrence of VT. In multivariate analysis, persistent eosinophilia was the sole variable associated with a shorter time to VT relapse (HR 7.48; CI95% [1.94-29.47]; p = 0.015).

332208,How has the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic affected global emoji usage?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Worldwide, many people have been affected by COVID-19, a novel respiratory illness, caused by a new type of coronavirus SARS-CoV2. The COVID-19 outbreak is considered a pandemic and has created a number of challenges for the general population, patients, and healthcare professionals. Lockdowns have been implemented to slow down the spread of the virus with the expectation that these restrictions will limit the number of cases, and hence the number of hospitalizations and ICU admissions. However, these restrictions, and in particular lockdowns, impact on the life of everyone living in Ireland. AIM: To record how the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent restrictive measures impacted on people's activities, work, schooling, and childcare. METHODS: The Corona Citizens' Science Project was set up as a population-wide survey. A questionnaire was designed, and the survey was first launched on the 8th of April 2020. An overview of results was released in the press days later. Data was collected in four waves: April 8, April 22, May 6, and June 17, 2020. Each wave had core questions allowing to compare each wave, and wave-specific questions, to understand current impact of changing measures. RESULTS: Over four waves, 152,259 responses were collected. The mean age of respondents was 47 with about 10% over the age of 65. Around 75% were female and 85% had a higher degree. Nearly 70% of the respondents were in employment, and around 13% were retired. Up to 20% of the respondents were essential workers, and 10% of respondents indicated they were in receipt of the COVID-19 pandemic unemployment payment. Around 10% of the people who responded were living alone. The number of people talked to the previous day was on average 2.3 in the first survey; during the lockdown, this went up over time, and in the last survey, the mean was 3.9. The percentage of respondents who did not talk to anyone the previous day decreased from 40 to 22% over the waves. In the first wave, about 6% of respondents reported having had flu-like symptoms in the last 14 days, which declined to 3.3%, 2.5%, and 2.0% in waves 2, 3, and 4 respectively. Similarly, over the four waves, the respondents who indicated that someone they lived with had flu-like symptoms declined from 17 to 12%, 9%, and 11%. Throughout the four waves, nearly one third of people reported one or more underlying conditions. CONCLUSIONS: As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of restrictive measures, in particular lockdown, were implemented in Ireland to protect populations and healthcare systems. To record some of the major impacts on society, we launched a Corona Citizens Science Project, with the aim to support decision-making. This report provides detail of its findings.","Vellinga, Akke; Mellotte, Marc; Mealy, P J; Staines, Anthony; O039,; Connor, Paul; Brychkova, Galina; d039,; Aquin, Mathieu",Ir. j. med. sci,,110

333801,The COVID-19 pandemic: higher medical education challenges and responses,2020,"BACKGROUND: In the coronavirus pandemic, two institutions play a central role in the evidence-based classification of events for politics and the population. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) coordinates the fight against the pandemic, prepares well-founded recommendations for medical professionals, the media and the population, and advises politicians. The Federal Centre for Health Education (BZgA) informs the population and institutions. GOALS: The COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring (COSMO) project monitors whether and how trust in institutions changes over the pandemic. Which population groups show trust and how this is related to attitudes, risk perception and behaviour are analysed. METHODS: Cross-sectional studies with approximately Nâ¯= 1000 respondents per survey were conducted since March 2020 to investigate risk perception, behaviour, acceptance of measures and trust in institutions. RESULTS: Trust in the RKI and BZgA was generally high but declined over the course of the pandemic. Higher trust for both institutions was associated with higher age of respondents, higher education, higher risk perception and higher acceptance of measures. Behaviours such as physical distancing and handwashing were shown more frequently. Men and the chronically ill showed lower trust. DISCUSSION: The results show that trust should be further promoted. This could be achieved, among other things, by taking into account the population's perspective (e.g. through COSMO) in the development and justification of strategies and measures. Communication strategies and recommendations for action should aim to support and relieve people with high-risk perceptions.","Eitze, Sarah; Felgendreff, Lisa; Korn, Lars; Sprengholz, Philipp; Allen, Jennifer; Jenny, Miriam A; Wieler, Lothar H; Thaiss, Heidrun; De Bock, Freia; Betsch, Cornelia",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,,110

341600,User reactions to COVID-19 screening chatbots from reputable providers,2020,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a surge in need for alternative routes of administration of drugs for end of life and palliative care, particularly in community settings. Transmucosal routes include intranasal, buccal, sublingual and rectal. They are non-invasive routes for systemic drug delivery with the possibility of self-administration, or administration by family caregivers. In addition, their ability to offer rapid onset of action with reduced first-pass metabolism make them suitable for use in palliative and end-of-life care to provide fast relief of symptoms. This is particularly important in COVID-19, as patients can deteriorate rapidly. Despite the advantages, these routes of administration face challenges including a relatively small surface area for effective drug absorption, small volume of fluid for drug dissolution and the presence of a mucus barrier, thereby limiting the number of drugs that are suitable to be delivered through the transmucosal route. In this review, the merits, challenges and limitations of each of these transmucosal routes are discussed. The goals are to provide insights into using transmucosal drug delivery to bring about the best possible symptom management for patients at the end of life, and to inspire scientists to develop new delivery systems to provide effective symptom management for this group of patients.","Lam, Jenny K W; Cheung, Chucky C K; Chow, Michael Y T; Harrop, Emily; Lapwood, Susie; Barclay, Stephen I G; Wong, Ian C K",Adv Drug Deliv Rev,,110

At the same time, the issue of the quarantine imposed changes to the normal lifestyle of these patients. The purpose of our study is to evaluate how the presence of these two factors affect the quality of live of patients living in the Italian red zone. METHODS: From outpatient pre-operative assessment we collect data about: demographic data, WOMAC score, NRS (Numeric rating scale 0-10), PCS SF12 and MCS SF12 score. Selected patients were therefore contacted by telephone call and re-assess using the same score. In addition, patients were asked if they intended to undergo the planned surgery again despite the current emergency Results: 14 patient have been recruited for the study. Male/female ration was 10/4, mean age was 70 years. Pre operative outpatient assessment mean WOMAC score was 44,86 (SD ± 8,52) , mean NRS was 8,07 (SD ± 1,33), PCS SF12 was 30,33 (SD ± 5,0) and MCS SF12 was 40,95 (SD ± 3,51). At re-evalutation the mean WOMAC score was 32,86 (SD ± 17,88) , mean NRS was 5,79 (SD ± 3,66), PCS SF12 was 39,9 (SD ± 3,70) and MCS SF12 was 50,14 (SD ± 6,86) Conclusion: The exceptionale pandemic from Covid-19 has profoundly changed our lifestyle, impacting normal daily activities but also on regular surgical activity in patients affected by osteoarthritis. Our study suggested that the lifestyle changes imposed by the situation led to an improvement of clinical score.

345350,Lessons From Learners: Adapting Medical Student Education During and Post-COVID-19,2021,"Since late 2019, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread all over the world. The disease is highly contagious, and it may lead to acute respiratory distress (ARD). Medical imaging can play an important role in classifying, detecting, and measuring the severity of the virus. This study aims to provide a novel auto-detection tool that can detect abnormal changes in conventional X-ray images for confirmed COVID-19 cases. X-ray images from patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were converted into 19 different colored layers. Each layer represented objects with similar contrast that could be defined as a specific color. The objects with similar contrasts were formed in a single layer. All the objects from all the layers were extracted as a single-color image. Based on the differentiation of colors, the prototype model was able to recognize a wide spectrum of abnormal changes in the image texture. This was true even if there was minimal variation of the contrast values of the detected uncleared abnormalities. The results indicate that the proposed novel method can detect and determine the degree of lung infection from COVID-19 with an accuracy of 91%, compared to the opinions of three experienced radiologists. The method can also efficiently determine the sites of infection and the severity of the disease by classifying the X-rays into five levels of severity. Thus, the proposed COVID-19 autodetection method can identify locations and indicate the degree of severity of the disease by comparing affected tissue with healthy tissue, and it can predict where the disease may spread.","Alqahtani, Mohammed S.; Abbas, Mohamed Alqahtani Ali Alshahrani Mohammad Alkulib Abdulhadi Alelyani Magbool Almarhaby Awad Alsabaani Abdullah",Diagnostics,,110

345505,"COVID-19, staying at home, and domestic violence",2020,"BACKGROUND: Prognostic tools are required to guide clinical decision-making in COVID-19. METHODS: We studied the relationship between the ratio of interleukin (IL)-6 to IL-10 and clinical outcome in 80 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, and created a simple 5-point linear score predictor of clinical outcome, the Dublin-Boston score. Clinical outcome was analysed as a three-level ordinal variable (""Improved"", ""Unchanged"", or ""Declined""). For both IL-6:IL-10 ratio and IL-6 alone, we associated clinical outcome with a) baseline biomarker levels, b) change in biomarker level from day 0 to day 2, c) change in biomarker from day 0 to day 4, and d) slope of biomarker change throughout the study. The associations between ordinal clinical outcome and each of the different predictors were performed with proportional odds logistic regression. Associations were run both ""unadjusted"" and adjusted for age and sex. Nested cross-validation was used to identify the model for incorporation into the Dublin-Boston score. FINDINGS: The 4-day change in IL-6:IL-10 ratio was chosen to derive the Dublin-Boston score. Each 1 point increase in the score was associated with a 5.6 times increased odds for a more severe outcome (OR 5.62, 95% CI -3.22-9.81, P = 1.2 × 10-9). Both the Dublin-Boston score and the 4-day change in IL-6:IL-10 significantly outperformed IL-6 alone in predicting clinical outcome at day 7. INTERPRETATION: The Dublin-Boston score is easily calculated and can be applied to a spectrum of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. More informed prognosis could help determine when to escalate care, institute or remove mechanical ventilation, or drive considerations for therapies.

Our goal was to investigate imaging volume trends during the pandemic at our large academic hospital compared to the affiliated imaging centers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a descriptive retrospective study of imaging volume from an academic hospital (main hospital campus) and its affiliated imaging centers from January 1 through May 21, 2020. Imaging volume assessment was separated into prestate of emergency (SOE) period (before SOE in Massachusetts on March 10, 2020), ""post-SOE"" period (time after ""nonessential"" services closure on March 24, 2020), and ""transition"" period (between pre-SOE and post-SOE). RESULTS: Imaging volume began to decrease on March 11, 2020, after hospital policy to delay nonessential studies. The average weekly imaging volume during the post-SOE period declined by 54% at the main hospital campus and 64% at the affiliated imaging centers. The rate of imaging volume recovery was slower for affiliated imaging centers (slopeâ¯=â¯6.95 for weekdays) compared to main hospital campus (slopeâ¯=â¯7.18 for weekdays). CT, radiography, and ultrasound exhibited the lowest volume loss, with weekly volume decrease of 41%, 49%, and 53%, respectively, at the main hospital campus, and 43%, 61%, and 60%, respectively, at affiliated imaging centers. Mammography had the greatest volume loss of 92% at both the main hospital campus and affiliated imaging centers. CONCLUSION: Affiliated imaging center volume decreased to a greater degree than the main hospital campus and showed a slower rate of recovery. Furthermore, the trend in imaging volume and recovery were temporally related to public health announcements and COVID-19 cases.","Lang, Min; Yeung, Tristan; Mendoza, Dexter P; Flores, Efren J; Som, Avik; Lang, Angela L; Pianykh, Oleg S; Lee, Susanna I; Saini, Sanjay; Little, Brent P; Succi, Marc D",Acad Radiol,,110
348882,Partisan Differences in Social Distancing Response to COVID-19 in the United States,2021,": This combined American Neurotology Society, American Otological Society, and American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery Foundation document aims to provide guidance during the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) on 1) ""priority"" of care for otologic and neurotologic patients in the office and operating room, and 2) optimal utilization of personal protective equipment. Given the paucity of evidence to inform otologic and neurotologic best practices during COVID-19, the recommendations herein are based on relevant peer-reviewed articles, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 guidelines, United States and international hospital policies, and expert opinion. The suggestions presented here are not meant to be definitive, and best practices will undoubtedly change with increasing knowledge and high-quality data related to COVID-19. Interpretation of this guidance document is dependent on local factors including prevalence of COVID-19 in the surgeons' local community. This is not intended to set a standard of care, and should not supersede the clinician's best judgement when managing specific clinical concerns and/or regional conditions.Access to otologic and neurotologic care during and after the COVID-19 pandemic is dependent upon adequate protection of physicians, audiologists, and ancillary support staff. Otolaryngologists and associated staff are at high risk for COVID-19 disease transmission based on close contact with mucosal surfaces of the upper aerodigestive tract during diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic procedures. While many otologic and neurotologic conditions are not imminently life threatening, they have a major impact on communication, daily functioning, and quality of life. In addition, progression of disease and delay in treatment can result in cranial nerve deficits, intracranial and life-threatening complications, and/or irreversible consequences. In this regard, many otologic and neurotologic conditions should rightfully be considered ""urgent,"" and almost all require timely attention to permit optimal outcomes. It is reasonable to proceed with otologic and neurotologic clinic visits and operative cases based on input from expert opinion of otologic care providers, clinic/hospital administration, infection prevention and control specialists, and local and state public health leaders. Significant regional variations in COVID-19 prevalence exist; therefore, physicians working with local municipalities are best suited to make determinations on the appropriateness and timing of otologic and neurotologic care.","Kozin, Elliott D; Remenschneider, Aaron K; Blevins, Nikolas H; Jan, Taha A; Quesnel, Alicia M; Chari, Divya A; Kesser, Bradley W; Weinstein, Jaqueline E; Ahsan, Syed F; Telischi, Fred F; Adunka, Oliver F; Weber, Peter; Knoll, Renata M; Coelho, Daniel H; Anne, Samantha; Franck, Kevin H; Marchioni, Daniele; Barker, Frederick G; Carter, Bob S; Lustig, Lawrence R; Bojrab, Dennis I; Bhansali, Sanjay A; Westerberg, Brian D; Lundy, Larry; Jackler, Robert K; Roland, J Thomas; Chandrasekhar, Sujana S; Antonelli, Patrick J; Carey, John P; Welling, D Bradley; Slattery, William H; Lee, Daniel J",Otol Neurotol,,110

The values of other inflammatory agents were also studied. In the late recovery stage, unlike CD56high CD16+/- NK cells and monocytes, CD56low CD16+ NK cell numbers were increased (P < 0.0001-0.05). Th1, Th2, and Th17 cell percentages were significantly lower in patients than healthy control (P < 0.0001-0.05), while their frequencies were increased following disease recovery (P < 0.0001-0.05). The numbers of Tregs, activated CD4+ T cells, and exhausted CD8+ T cells were significantly decreased during a recovery (P < 0.0001-0.05). No significant change was observed in exhausted CD4+ T cell number during a recovery (P > 0.05). B cell showed an increased percentage in patients compared to healthy subjects (P < 0.0001-0.05), whereas its number was reduced following recovery (P < 0.0001-0.05).

Indeed, vitamin D has been found to boost the innate immune system and stimulate the adaptive immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this review, we provide a comprehensive update of the immunological mechanisms underlying the positive effects of vitamin D in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as a thorough survey of the recent epidemiological studies and clinical trials that tested vitamin D as a potential therapeutic agent against COVID-19 infection. We believe that a better understanding of the histopathology and immunopathology of the disease as well as the mechanism of vitamin D effects on COVID-19 severity will ultimately pave the way for a more effective prevention and control of this global pandemic.","Shah Alam, Mohammad; Czajkowsky, Daniel M; Aminul Islam, Md; Ataur Rahman, Md",Int Immunopharmacol,,110

350549,Estimating the Effect of Social Distancing Interventions on COVID-19 in the United States,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Although bans or restrictions on alcohol advertising are recommended as one of the three most effective and cost-effective policies to curb alcohol consumption, the best evidence to support this is indirect. The aim of this study was to examine whether the complete ban on alcohol advertising in Norway in 1975 had any effect on total alcohol sales. METHODS: Annual time series of recorded alcohol sales (1960-2006) were analysed. Autoregressive integrated moving average interrupted time series techniques were used to model the effect of the advertising ban, adjusting for alcohol prices and wages. RESULTS: The autoregressive integrated moving average analyses showed a negative and statistically significant effect of the ban on total recorded alcohol sales, suggesting an immediate and lasting reduction of 7.4% (P = 0.002). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The complete ban on alcohol advertising in 1975 in Norway reduced recorded alcohol sales. This suggests that the ban had a protective effect by reducing total alcohol consumption. The conclusion remains tentative because of possible effects of unrecorded alcohol consumption and marketing on social media and satellite TV channels.","Rossow, Ingeborg",Drug alcohol rev,,110
350550,Estimating the Effect of Social Distancing Interventions on COVID-19 in the United States,2021,"HSPA5 (BiP, GRP78) has been reported as a potential host-cell receptor for SARS-Cov-2, but its expression profiles on different tissues including tumors, its susceptibility to SARS-Cov-2 virus and severity of its adverse effects on malignant patients are unclear. In the current study, HSPA5 has been found to be expressed ubiquitously in normal tissues and significantly increased in 14 of 31 types of cancer tissues. In lung cancer, mRNA levels of HSPA5 were 253-fold increase than that of ACE2. Meanwhile, in both malignant tumors and matched normal samples across almost all cancer types, mRNA levels of HSPA5 were much higher than those of ACE2. Higher expression of HSPA5 significantly decreased patient overall survival (OS) in 7 types of cancers. Moreover, systematic analyses found that 7.15% of 5,068 COVID-19 cases have malignant cancer coincidental situations, and the rate of severe events of COVID-19 patients with cancers present a higher trend than that for all COVID-19 patients, showing a significant difference (33.33% vs 16.09%, p<0.01). Collectively, these data imply that the tissues with high HSPA5 expression, not low ACE2 expression, are susceptible to be invaded by SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, this study not only indicates the clinical significance of HSPA5 in COVID-19 disease and cancers, but also provides potential clues for further medical treatments and managements of COVID-19 patients.","Fu, Jiewen; Wei, Chunli; He, Jiayue; Zhang, Lianmei; Zhou, Ju; Balaji, Kyathegowdanadoddi Srinivasa; Shen, Shiyi; Peng, Jiangzhou; Sharma, Amrish; Fu, Junjiang",Int J Biol Sci,,110

A global response to prepare health systems worldwide is imperative. Although containment measures in China have reduced new cases by more than 90%, this reduction is not the case elsewhere, and Italy has been particularly affected. There is now grave concern regarding the Italian national health system's capacity to effectively respond to the needs of patients who are infected and require intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The percentage of patients in intensive care reported daily in Italy between March 1 and March 11, 2020, has consistently been between 9% and 11% of patients who are actively infected. The number of patients infected since Feb 21 in Italy closely follows an exponential trend. If this trend continues for 1 more week, there will be 30â000 infected patients. Intensive care units will then be at maximum capacity; up to 4000 hospital beds will be needed by mid-April, 2020. Our analysis might help political leaders and health authorities to allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks. If the Italian outbreak follows a similar trend as in Hubei province, China, the number of newly infected patients could start to decrease within 3-4 days, departing from the exponential trend. However, this cannot currently be predicted because of differences between social distancing measures and the capacity to quickly build dedicated facilities in China.","Remuzzi, Andrea; Remuzzi, Giuseppe",Lancet,,110

However, few curricula exist for training residents on how to care for patients via telemedicine, especially in pediatrics. We aimed to create and evaluate an interactive, competency-based pilot curriculum, to meet the urgent need to train residents in telemedicine. The curriculum was developed in 2020 and includes a didactic, cased-based discussions, and direct observation exercise. A model for precepting residents, adhering to new ACGME guidelines, was also created to further engage residents in telemedicine in the outpatient general pediatrics settings. To evaluate the curriculum, we assessed feasibility of a direct observation to provide feedback and we conducted pre and post surveys to assess for changes in residents' self-reported skills in performing telemedicine visits following implementation of the curriculum. 16 residents participated in the curriculum and 15 completed both the pre and post surveys (93%). Residents' self-reported efficacy in performing key components of telemedicine visits, including completion of telemedicine visit (p = 0.023), initiation of visits (p = 0.01), and documentation (p = 0.001) all improved significantly following implementation. Residents' perception of patient satisfaction with telemedicine and personal perception of ease of use of the telemedicine system increased, though neither were statistically significant. Uptake of the direct observation exercise was nearly universal, with all but one resident having a direct observation completed during their ambulatory month. This novel, interactive telemedicine pilot curriculum for residents addresses ACGME competencies and provides residents with a toolkit for engaging in telemedicine.","Costich, Marguerite; Robbins-Milne, Laura; Bracho-Sanchez, Edith; Lane, Mariellen; Friedman, Suzanne",Med Educ Online,,110

It has 79.5% sequence identity with SARS-CoV-1 and the same strategy for host cell invasion through the ACE-2 surface protein. Since the development of novel drugs is a long-lasting process, researchers look for effective substances among drugs already approved or developed for other purposes. The 3D structure of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease was compared with the 3D structures of seven proteases, which are drug targets, and docking analysis to the SARS-CoV-2 protease structure of thirty four approved and on-trial protease inhibitors was performed. Increased 3D structural similarity between the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, the HCV protease and &#945;-thrombin was found. According to docking analysis the most promising results were found for HCV protease, DPP-4, &#945;-thrombin and coagulation Factor Xa known inhibitors, with several of them exhibiting estimated free binding energy lower than -8.00 kcal/mol and better prediction results than reference compounds. Since some of the compounds are well-tolerated drugs, the promising in silico results may warrant further evaluation for viral anticipation. DPP-4 inhibitors with anti-viral action may be more useful for infected patients with diabetes, while anti-coagulant treatment is proposed in severe SARS-CoV-2 induced pneumonia.","Eleftheriou, Phaedra; Amanatidou, Dionysia; Petrou, Anthi; Geronikaki, Athina",Molecules (Basel),,110

The present study proposes a model to explain the preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors among people with mental illness in Taiwan. METHODS: A cross-sectional design was carried out and 414 patients with mental illness (230 males [55.6%]; mean age = 46.32 [SD = 10.86]) agreed to participate in the study. All the participants completed the Preventive COVID-19 Infection Behaviors Scale, Self-Stigma Scale-Short, Believing COVID-19 Information Scale, Fear of COVID-19 Scale, and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21. Regression models and structural equation modeling (SEM) were applied to examine the factors associated with preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors. RESULTS: Both regression models and SEM showed that trust in COVID-19 information sources (standardized coefficient [ß] = 0.211 in regression; ß = 0.194 in SEM) and fear of COVID-19 (ß = -0.128 in regression; ß = -0.223 in SEM) significantly explained preventive behaviors among individuals with mental illness. The SEM further showed that fear of COVID-19 was significantly explained by trust in COVID-19 information sources (ß = 0.220) and self-stigma (ß = 0.454). CONCLUSION: Based on the results, healthcare providers should help individuals with mental illness reduce self-stigma and fear of COVID-19 which would consequently improve their preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors. Moreover, improving trust in COVID-19 information sources for individuals with mental illness may be another method to improve their preventive behaviors.","Chang, Kun-Chia; Strong, Carol; Pakpour, Amir H; Griffiths, Mark D; Lin, Chung-Ying",J Formos Med Assoc,,110

360575,A Mobile App to Facilitate Socially Distanced Hospital Communication During COVID-19: Implementation Experience,2021,"AIM: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has meant a global change in the healthcare model, enhancing telematic assistance, specially at the Health Primary Care (PC). There are few studies that relate the attendance of children at the PC to the pandemic of COVID-19. The aim of our study is to describe the impact of the two Spanish states of alarm on the care of children at de PC level. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective observational study. The PC visits corresponding to pediatric patients (<14 years) from a health area in northern Spain during the first and second states of alarm were analyzed, and compared with their equivalent periods in 2019. RESULTS: During the first state of alarm, home lockdown and school closure were established, and a large decrease in pediatric visits to the health centres was observed (758 vs. 1381 in 2019) at the expense of health check-ups and infectious diseases. This decrease was not observed in the second state of alarm (1375 vs. 1233 in 2019). In both states of alarm, the percentage of telephone assistance increased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of alarm states has meant a decrease on the demand of medical care, especially during the first state of alarm, may be owing to the fear of the families of going to the health center and the decrease in the transmissibility of viruses due to home lockdown. The increase of the telematic assistance has been on account of the need of reorganization of health care, wich has proven to be effective.","Laso-Alonso, A E; Mata-Zubillaga, D; González-García, L G; Rodríguez-Manchón, S; Corral-Hospital, S; García-Aparicio, C","SEMERGEN, Soc.

Conventionally, a complex-valued transmission matrix is obtained experimentally to link the input and output light fields of a multimode fiber for image retrieval, which complicates the experimental setup and increases the computational complexity. Here, we report a simple and high-speed method for image retrieval based on our discovery of a pseudo-linearity between the input and output light intensity distributions of multimode fibers. We studied the impact of several key parameters to image retrieval, including image pixel count, fiber core diameter and numerical aperture. We further demonstrated that a wide variety of input binary images could be faithfully retrieved from measured output speckle patterns using this method, promising to be useful for highly miniaturized endoscopy in biomedicine and spatial-mode-division multiplexing in telecommunications.","Zhao, Tianrui; Ourselin, Sebastien; Vercauteren, Tom; Xia, Wenfeng",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.00224v1.pdf,110

The aim of our study was to compare lab technician-with patient-collected oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal samples for detection of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) using rapid real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Methods: Fifty adult patients with flu-like symptoms and radiologic findings compatible with atypical pneumonia who were admitted to the infectious diseases ward of Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex, Tehran, Iran, with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 from February 28 to April 27 of 2020 were randomly selected and entered in our study. Two sets of naso-and oropharyngeal swabs were collected, one set by a lab technician and the other by the patients, and the COVID-19 rRT-PCR test was performed. Results: Of 50 selected cases, in seven patients all collected naso-and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive, and in 22 patients all samples tested negative for COVID-19 in rRT-PCR. Discrepancies between rRT-PCR results of lab technician-and patient-collected swabs were observed in 12 nasopharyngeal and 13 oropharyngeal specimens.

These may vary from fatigue and myalgia to persistent, and even worsening breathlessness, due to pulmonary fibrosis. Management of post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis is currently limited to symptomatic management and largely an unexplored aspect. Objectives: To draw attention to the imminent threat of post-COVID-19 interstitial lung disease (PC-ILD) in COVID survivors through a case series. Methods: A retrospective analysis of data was done in patients admitted with severe COVID in December 2020 at our tertiary care hospital, and who had a prolonged stay with symptoms and signs suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis. HRCT was done to make a diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis or ILD. Three such patients were identified. Results: All the three cases were laboratory proven SARS CoV-2 positive cases and had developed pulmonary fibrosis, with traction bronchiectasis, termed here as PC-ILD (Post Covid-Interstitial Lung Disease). Two of them survived and had improved oxygen saturation on room air at three-month follow-up, while one patient had developed arrhythmia and died. Conclusion: PC- ILD is one of the emerging complications of COVID-19 pneumonia. A proactive follow-up programme should be undertaken to identify and manage this looming epidemic. © 2021 Journal of Association of Physicians of India. All rights reserved.","Singh, A. K.; Kumar, O.

365511,The relationship between subjective happiness and social media usage during the COVID-19 pandemic: The moderating role of resilience,2020,"OBJECTIVES: We comparatively evaluated two HIV and syphilis blood sampling kits (dried blood spot (DBS) and mini tube (MT)) as part of an online STI postal sampling service that included tests for chlamydia and gonorrhoea. We aimed to see how the blood collection systems compared regarding sample return rates and result rates. Additionally, we aimed to observe differences in false-positive results and describe a request-to-result ratio (RRR)-the required number of kit requests needed to obtain one successful result. METHODS: We reviewed data from an online postal STI kit requesting service for a client transitioning from MT to DBS blood collection systems. We described service user baseline characteristics and compared kit requests, kit and blood sample return rates, and the successful resulting rates for HIV and syphilis for MT and DBS. Pearson's &#967;2 and Fisher's exact test were used to determine statistical differences, and statistical formulae were applied to produce CIs for differences in proportions. RESULTS: 5670 STI postal kit requests from a Midlands region were reviewed from 6 September 2016-2 January 2019 (1515 MT and 4155 DBS). Baseline characteristics between the two groups were comparable (68.0% female, 74.0% white British and 87.5% heterosexual, median age 26 years). Successful processing rates for DBS were 94.6% and 54.4% for MT (p<0.001) with a percentage difference of 40.2% (95% CI 36.9% to 43.4%). The RRR for MT was 2.9 cf. 1.6 for DBS. False-positive results for MT samples were 5.2% (HIV) and 0.4% (syphilis), and those for DBS were 0.4% (HIV) and 0.0% (syphilis). CONCLUSIONS: This comparative analysis demonstrated the superior successful processing rates for postal DBS collection systems compared with MT. Reasons for this included insufficient volumes, high false-positive rates and degradation of blood quality in MT samples. A postal sampling service using DBS to screen for HIV, syphilis and other blood-borne viruses could be a viable alternative.","Page, Matthew; Atabani, Sowsan; Arumainayagam, Joseph; Wilson, Steven; Hartland, Daniel; Taylor, Stephen",Sex Transm Infect,,110

Anesthesia management was performed under tertiary medical protection measures. A dedicated anesthesia equipment was separately sterilized. Narcotic drugs were used for one patient only, and disposable medical supplies were used for anesthetic supplies. Contact transmission should be avoided when a neonate required resuscitation, and early isolation and nucleic acid testing were provided for the neonates. The rate of suspected cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was 11% , and the rate of clinically diagnosed cases was 17% before surgery. The rate of clinically diagnosed cases of 2019-nCoV was 22%, the rate of confirmed cases was 8%, and the total positive rate of diagnosis was 31% after surgery. The rate of neuraxial anesthesia was 86%, the rate of general anesthesia was 14%, the time of spinal puncture was (15±7) min, the time of tracheal intubation under general anesthesia was (2.1±1.3) min, the operation time was (95±36) min, and blood loss was (276±166) ml. The Apgar score of newborns was 8.8 ± 0.5. There was 1 neonate whose mother was diagnosed as having 2019 novel coronavirous disease after operation, an oropharyngeal swab specimen was obtained at 36 h of birth, and the swab was tested positive for 2019-nCoV by nucleic acid testing. As of February 10, 2020, an anesthesiologist involved in the operation was diagnosed to have infection by 2019-nCoV. In conclusion, diagnosis of 2019 novel coronavirous disease during pregnancy is more difficult, it is necessary to perform anesthesia management for cesarean section under tertiary medical protection. Although the difficulty in anesthesia operation is increased under tertiary medical protection, anesthesiologists can carry out standardized anesthesia management and guarantee the safety of maternal and infants and anesthesiologists themselves as long as they are rigorously trained and adhere to protective protocols.","ZHOU, Zhiqiang; SUN, Xingxing; Shiyong, LI; WAN, Li; LUO, Ailin; HAN, Dongji",Chinese Journal of Anesthesiology,,110
367343,The Role of Medical Student Government in Responding to COVID-19,2020,"Mountain biking as a recreational sport is currently thriving. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, even more people started compensating for a lack of activity through individual outdoor sports, such as cycling. However, when executed beyond paved forest roads, mountain biking is a sport with subjective and objective risks, in which crashes often can not be entirely avoided and athletes may get injured. In this late-breaking work, we showcase a concept for a crash risk indication application for sports smartwatches. First, we review a wide range of related work, which formed the basis for our crash risk indication metric. We discuss options for the sensor-based detection of internal and external risk factors and propose a way to aggregate them, which will allow dynamic and potentially automatic fine-tuning by observing or obtaining feedback from the athlete. In addition, we present a concept for a smartwatch application that will provide constant feedback and an unobtrusive signal to the athlete when an unusually high risk is detected. Finally, we give an outlook on the necessary steps to implement our approach as a smartwatch app. © 2021 ACM.","Langer, S.; Dietz, D.; Butz, A.","2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems: Making Waves, Combining Strengths, CHI EA 2021",,110
367857,Medical Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Learning From A Distance,2020,"BACKGROUND: Surgical site infection (SSI) and wound breakdown after emergency laparotomy are common. They incur significant patient morbidity and health care costs. Negative-pressure dressings (NPDs) applied over closed incisions may minimize wound complications. However, its utility in the emergency setting is unknown. Here, we examined whether prophylactic NPD reduces wound complications after emergency laparotomies. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of consecutive emergency laparotomies undertaken at a university hospital from January 2018 to October 2019. Outcomes included the rate of SSI, wound breakdown, hospital-outreach service utilization, wound-related readmissions, and length of stay. Propensity score matched analysis was used to assess bias. RESULTS: A total of 227 emergency laparotomies were reviewed, 70 received NPD and 157 had conventional dressings (controls). SSI was identified in 33 (21.0%) patients from the control group and six (8.6%) from the NPD group (odds ratio 0.35, 95% confidence interval: 0.15-0.85, P = 0.022). Wound breakdown was observed in 21 (13.4%) patients from the control group and three (4.3%) from the NPD group (odds ratio 0.29, 95% confidence interval: 0.09-0.91, P = 0.040). The prophylactic benefit of NPD was most evident in clean-contaminated, contaminated, and dirty wounds. The NPD group had comparatively shorter postoperative stay, less outreach service utilization, and lower rates of wound-related readmissions. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that increasing age, body weight >75 kg, and wound contamination are independent predictors of wound complications, whereas NPD prevented SSI and wound breakdown. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic NPD significantly reduced wound complications after emergency laparotomy. This was associated with a substantial health resource saving. This study provides a strong rationale for randomized trials in this area.","Liu, David S; Cheng, Chao; Islam, Rumana; Tacey, Mark; Sidhu, Ankur; Lam, David; Strugnell, Neil",J Surg Res,,110

Systematic appraisal of senior surgeons' consensus can be used to generate interim recommendations until data from clinical observations become available. Hence, we aimed to collect and quantitatively appraise nationwide UK consultants' opinions on clinical decision making for patients requiring cardiac surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We E-mailed a Web-based questionnaire to all consultant cardiac surgeons through the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery in Great Britain and Ireland mailing list on the April 17, 2020, and we predetermined to close the survey on the April 21, 2020. This survey was primarily designed to gather information on UK surgeons' opinions using 12 items. Strong consensus was predefined as an opinion shared by at least 60% of responding consultants. RESULTS: A total of 86 consultant surgeons undertook the survey. All UK cardiac units were represented by at least 1 consultant. Strong consensus was achieved for the following key questions: (1) before any hospital admission for cardiac surgery, nasopharyngeal swab, polymerase chain reaction, and computed tomography of the chest should be performed; (2) the use of full personal protective equipment should to be adopted in every case by the theater team regardless of the patient's COVID-19 status; (3) the risk of COVID-19 exposure for patients undergoing heart surgery should be considered moderate to high and likely to increase mortality if it occurs; and (4) cardiac procedures should be decided based on a rapidly convened multidisciplinary team discussion for every patient. The majority believed that both aortic and mitral surgery should be considered in selected cases. The role of coronary artery bypass graft surgery during the pandemic was controversial. CONCLUSIONS: In this unprecedented pandemic period, this survey provides information for generating interim recommendations until data from clinical observations become available.","Benedetto, Umberto; Goodwin, Andrew; Kendall, Simon; Uppal, Rakesh; Akowuah, Enoch",J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,,110

The characterisation and description of chestnut populations and cultivars are crucial to develop effective conservation strategies of one of the most important Italian and European fruit and wood species. Chestnut cultivars grown in the same pedoclimatic conditions and on the same clonal rootstock were characterised with sensory, spectrophotometric, and chromatographic analysis to determine the phytochemical composition and nutraceutical properties. A multivariate approach, including principal component analysis and conditional inference tree models, was also performed. The ease of peeling, seed colour, and intensity of sweetness were the sensory descriptors that allowed us to differentiate C. sativa cultivars. Antioxidant capacity ranged from 9.30 ± 0.39 mmol Fe+2 kg-1 DW ('Bouche de Bètizac') to 19.96 ± 1.89 mmol Fe+2 kg-1 DW ('Garrone Rosso'). Monoterpenes represented the main component, reaching 88% for hybrids, followed by polyphenols (10-25% for hybrids and chestnuts, respectively). A multivariate approach showed that phenolic acids and tannins were the bioactive classes with the highest discriminating power among different genotypes, and that genotype is a significant variable (p < 0.05). In addition, most of the analysed chestnut cultivars showed a content of bioactive compounds similar to or higher than the main hazelnut, walnut, and almond varieties. Chestnut agrobiodiversity could be intended as strictly associated to the genotype effect and underlines the large variability within the genus Castanea, and therefore, the importance of in farm and ex situ conservation of local germplasm is part of a global strategy aimed at increasing the levels of agrobiodiversity.","Beccaro, Gabriele L; Donno, Dario; Lione, Guglielmo Gianni; De Biaggi, Marta; Gamba, Giovanni; Rapalino, Sabrina; Riondato, Isidoro; Gonthier, Paolo; Mellano, Maria Gabriella",,,110

The need to provide high-level care for an enormous number of patients with COVID-19 infection during this pandemic has impacted resourcing for and restricted the routine care of all non-COVID-19 conditions. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the people living with rare disorders, who represent a marginalized group of the population even in a normal world, have not received enough attention that they deserve. Due to the pandemic situation, they have experienced (and experiencing) an extreme inadequacy of regular clinical services, counseling, and therapies they need, which have made their life more vulnerable and feel more marginalized. Besides, the clinicians, researchers, and scientists working on rare genetic diseases face extra challenges due to the pandemic. Many ongoing research projects and clinical trials for rare and genetic diseases were stalled to avoid patients' and research staff's transmission to COVID-19. Still, with all the odds, telehealth and virtual consultations for rare disease patients have shown hope. The clinical, organizational, and economic challenges faced by institutions, patients, their families, and the caregivers during the pandemic indicate the importance of ensuring continuity of care in managing rare diseases, including adequate diagnostics and priority management strategies for emergencies. In this review, we endeavored to shed light on the issues the rare disease community faces during the pandemic and the adaptations that could help the rare disease community to better sustain in the coming days.","Chowdhury, Sanjana Fatema; Sium, Syed Muktadir Al; Anwar, Saeed",Front Public Health,,110

Four stages of COVID-19 have been identified: the first stage is characterised by upper respiratory tract infection; the second by the onset of dyspnoea and pneumonia; the third by a worsening clinical scenario dominated by a cytokine storm and the consequent hyperinflammatory state; and the fourth by death or recovery. Currently, no treatment can act specifically against the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on the pathological features and different clinical phases of COVID-19, particularly in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, the classes of drugs used are antiviral agents, inflammation inhibitors/antirheumatic drugs, low molecular weight heparins, plasma, and hyperimmune immunoglobulins. During this emergency period of the COVID-19 outbreak, clinical researchers are using and testing a variety of possible treatments. Based on these premises, this review aims to discuss the most updated pharmacological treatments to effectively act against the SARS-CoV-2 infection and support researchers and clinicians in relation to any current and future developments in curing COVID-19 patients.","Stasi, Cristina; Fallani, Silvia; Voller, Fabio; Silvestri, Caterina",Eur J Pharmacol,,110

In the past decades, the rise of genetic-based screening methods and high-throughput sequencing approaches allowed the uncovering of unique and elusive aspects of RNA virus replication and pathogenesis at an unprecedented scale. However, viruses often hijack critical host functions or trigger pathological dysfunctions, perturbing cellular proteostasis, macromolecular complex organization or stoichiometry, and post-translational modifications. Such effects require the monitoring of proteins and proteoforms both on a global scale and at the structural level. Mass spectrometry (MS) has recently emerged as an important component of the RNA virus biology toolbox, with its potential to shed light on critical aspects of virus-host perturbations and streamline the identification of antiviral targets. Moreover, multiple novel MS tools are available to study the structure of large protein complexes, providing detailed information on the exact stoichiometry of cellular and viral protein complexes and critical mechanistic insights into their functions. Here, we review top-down and bottom-up mass spectrometry-based approaches in RNA virus biology with a special focus on the most recent developments in characterizing host responses, and their translational implications to identify novel tractable antiviral targets.","Simanjuntak, Yogy; Schamoni-Kast, Kira; Grün, Alice; Uetrecht, Charlotte; Scaturro, Pietro",Viruses,,110

We assessed the impact of COVID-19 related societal restrictions and lockdown on trauma admissions to single Level 1 Trauma Center in Westmead, Australia. We hypothesized that the number of trauma admissions would decrease and number of admissions due to self-harm and assault (specifically domestic violence) would increase. METHODS: Data was collected from the prospectively maintained Westmead Hospital Trauma Registry. The primary outcome compared the average number of trauma admissions during March and April during years 2016 to 2020. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze means. Pairwise differences among group means were evaluated with Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference test. Secondary outcomes compared were in-hospital interventions and patient outcomes. RESULTS: There was a 23-34% decrease (p value 0.018) in the mean monthly average trauma admissions during March/April 2020 compared with previous years 2016-2019. Additionally, there was a 40-52% decrease (p value 0.025) and 13-29% decrease (p value 0.020) in admissions due to road traffic collisions and falls respectively. CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant decrease in the overall number of trauma related admissions during the COVID-19 related period of societal restrictions and lockdown. This was due to a decrease in minor traumas, falls and road traffic collisions. There was no difference in the number of admissions secondary to major traumas, self-harm or assault.

Materials and Methods: A sequential systematic literature search was conducted from December 2019 to 30 April 2020 through PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Google Scholar, Embase, and Web of Science databases. The search yielded the following results: ""COVID-19"" (n = 12,137), ""Novel corona virus"" (n = 63), ""COVID-19 and dentistry"" (n = 46), ""COVID-19 and oral health"" (n = 41), ""Novel Corona virus and Dentistry"" (n = 0), ""dental health and Novel Coronavirus"" (n = 26), and ""dental practice and Novel Coronavirus"" (n = 6). Results: After a careful review and eliminating articles based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, the final review included 13 articles. Management of infection control is discussed extensively in the literature and remains the main theme of many Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) articles on dentistry. Telephone triage using a questionnaire, hand hygiene, personal protective equipment (PPE) for clinical and nonclinical staff, a preprocedural mouth rinse, and aerosol management have been discussed and implemented in few countries. Three studies recommended that elective treatments for patients with a temperature of >100.4 F or 38 °C should be postponed or performed in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) or negative-pressure room. Limiting the number of patients in the waiting area, the removal of shared objects, proper ventilation, and physical distancing were highly recommended. Psychological distress among dental professionals in relation to existing medical conditions and self-efficacy has been discussed. Conclusions: Although the COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on the dental profession worldwide, our review highlights many practice management approaches to adopt the new norm. More research highlighting evidence-based safety practices and multisectoral collaboration is required to help dental professionals make informed decisions and make the profession safe, both for the patient and dental professionals.","Mahdi, Syed Sarosh; Ahmed, Zohaib; Allana, Raheel; Peretti, Alessandro; Amenta, Francesco; Nadeem Bijle, Mohammed; Seow, Liang Lin; Daood, Umer",Medicina (Kaunas),,110

Though there are several methods available for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 such as RT-PCR and ELSIA, nevertheless, these methods are time-consuming and may not apply at the point of care. In this study, we have developed a specific, sensitive, quantitative and fast detection method for SARS-CoV-2 by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. The total extracellular protease proteolytic activity from the virus has been used as the biomarker. The specific peptide sequences from the library of 115 dipeptides were identified via changes in the fluorescence signal. The fluorogenic dipeptide substrates have the fluorophore and a quencher at the N- and the C- terminals, respectively. When the protease hydrolyzes the peptide bond between the two specific amino acids, it leads to a significant increase in the fluorescence signals. The specific fluorogenic peptide (H-d) produces a high fluorescence signal. A calibration plot was obtained from the changes in the fluorescence intensity against the different concentrations of the viral protease. The lowest limit of detection of this method was 9.7 ± 3 pfu/mL. The cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-2-specific peptide was tested against the MERS-CoV which does not affect the fluorescence signal. A significant change in the fluorescence signal with patient samples indicates that this FRET-based assay might be applied for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 patients.

Oxygen transfer in a low-flux hollow fiber dialyser with a polysulfone membrane was studied by passing first water and then blood through the dialyser in countercurrent to high-purity oxygen. Oxygen transfer rates of about 15% of the nominal 250 ml (STP)/min of a typical adult oxygen consumption rate were achieved for blood flow rates of 500 ml/min. Using two such dialysis devices in parallel could provide up to 30% of the nominal oxygen consumption.

388170,Applying an equity lens to urban policy measures for COVID-19 in four cities,2020,"PURPOSE: Behaviour change techniques are fundamental to the development of any behaviour change intervention, but surprisingly little is known about their properties. Key questions include when, why, how, in which contexts, for which behaviours, in what combinations, compared with what, and for whom behaviour change techniques are typically effective. The aims of the present paper are to: (1) articulate the scope of the challenge in understanding the properties of behaviour change techniques, (2) propose means by which to tackle this problem, and (3) call scientists to action. METHODS: Iterative consensus (O'Connor et al., 2020, Br. J. Psychol., e12468) was used to elicit and distil the judgements of experts on how best to tackle the problem of understanding the nature and operation of behaviour change techniques. RESULTS: We propose a worldwide network of 'Centres for Understanding Behaviour Change' (CUBiC) simultaneously undertaking research to establish what are the single and combined properties of behaviour change techniques across multiple behaviours and populations. We additionally provide a first attempt to systematize an approach that CUBiC could use to understand behaviour change techniques and to begin to harness the efforts of researchers worldwide. CONCLUSION: Better understanding of behaviour change techniques is vital for improving behaviour change interventions to tackle global problems such as obesity and recovery from COVID-19. The CUBiC proposal is just one of many possible solutions to the problems that the world faces and is a call to action for scientists to work collaboratively to gain deeper understanding of the underpinnings of behaviour change interventions.","Armitage, Christopher J; Conner, Mark; Prestwich, Andrew; de Bruin, Marijn; Johnston, Marie; Sniehotta, Falko; Epton, Tracy",Br. j. health psychol,,110

388488,Learning During and From a Crisis: The Student-Led Development of a COVID-19 Curriculum,2020,"OBJECTIVES: There is limited data regarding the demographics and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. This information is especially important as pneumonia is the single leading cause of death in children worldwide. This Systematic Review aims to elucidate a better understanding of the global impact of COVID-19 on the pediatric population. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines to gain insight into pediatric COVID-19 epidemiology. Specifically, Pubmed and Google Scholar databases were searched to identify any relevant article with a focus on Pediatric Covid 19, Pediatric Covid-19, Pediatric SARS-COV-2, and Pediatric Coronavirus 19. References within the included articles were reviewed. All articles that met criteria where analyzed for demographics, clinical, laboratory, radiographic, treatment and outcomes data. RESULTS: Ten studies including two case series and 8 retrospective chart reviews, altogether describing a total of 2914 pediatric patients with COVID-19 were included in this systematic review. Of the patients whose data was available, 56% were male, the age range was 1â¯day to 17â¯years, 79% were reported to have no comorbidities, and of the 21% with comorbidities, the most common were asthma, immunosupression, and cardiovascular disease. Of pediatric patients that were tested and positive for an infection with SARS-CoV-2, patients were asymptomatic, 14.9% of the time. Patients presented with cough (48%), fever (47%) and sore throat/pharyngitis (28.6%), more commonly than with upper respiratory symptoms/rhinorrhea/sneezing/nasal congestion (13.7%), vomiting/nausea (7.8%) and diarrhea (10.1%). Median lab values including those for WBC, lymphocyte count and CRP, were within the reference ranges with the exception of procalcitonin levels, which were slightly elevated in children with COVID-19 (median procalcitonin levels ranged from 0.07 to 0.5â¯ng/mL. Computed tomography (CT) results suggest that unilateral CT imaging findings are present 36% of cases while 64% of pediatric patients with COVID-19 had bilateral findings. Of the studies with age specific hospitalization data available, 27.0% of patients hospitalized were infants under 1â¯year of age. Various treatment regimens including interferon, antivirals, and hydroxychloroquine therapies have been trialed on the pediatric population but there are currently no studies showing efficacy of one regimen over the other. The mortality rate of children that were hospitalized with COVID-19 was 0.18%. CONCLUSION: In contrast to adults, most infected children appear to have a milder course and have better outcomes overall. Additional care may be needed for children with comorbidities and younger children. This review also suggests that unilateral CT chest imaging findings were seen in 36.4% pediatric COVID-19 patients. This is particularly concerning as the work-up of pediatric patients with cough may warrant a bronchoscopy to evaluate for airway foreign bodies. Extra precautions need to be taken with personal protective equipment for these cases, as aerosolizing procedures may be a method of viral transmission.

390386,Worried of Not COVID-19 but Fear of Hunger and Starvation: Challenges of the Poor Nigerians,2021,"This study investigates changes in willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 and the effect of the extended restrictions in metropolitan Victoria on this change. Longitudinal and repeated cross-sectional data were collected from online surveys distributed in April, between July and August, and December 2020. Australian adults who were ≥18 years old were recruited through email lists, social media networks, and paid Facebook advertisement. Willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 was self-reported. The results showed that participants were more willing to vaccinate if the vaccine was safe at survey 1 (longitudinal: adjusted OR (aOR) = 1.88, 95%CI = 1.38, 2.56;cross-sectional: aOR = 3.73, 95%CI = 2.55, 5.45) and survey 2 (longitudinal: aOR = 1.54, 95%CI = 1.19, 2.00;cross-sectional: aOR = 2.48, 1.67, 3.67), compared to survey 3. The change in willingness to vaccinate if the vaccine was safe and effective was not significant for those in Metropolitan Victoria;but was for those living in other Australian locations at survey 1 (OR = 2.13, 95%CI = 1.64, 2.76) and survey 2 (OR = 1.62, 95%CI = 1.30, 2.01), compared to survey 3. Willingness to vaccinate even if a vaccine had not been proven safe decreased at survey 3 (OR = 2.02, 95%CI = 1.14, 3.57) for those living in Metropolitan Victoria. In conclusion willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 decreased over time among Australians, except for those living in metropolitan Victoria, where an additional strict and prolonged lockdown was implemented around the time of survey 2. Either the experience of the lockdown, or the presence of the COVID-19 virus itself had a positive influence on participants’ willingness to vaccinate, even if such a vaccine was not yet proven to be safe and effective.","To, Quyen G.; Stanton, Robert Khalesi Saman Williams Susan L.; Alley, Stephanie J.; Thwaite, Tanya L.; Fenning, Andrew S.; Vandelanotte, Corneel",Vaccines,,110

Abnormal liver chemistry tests of varying severities occur in a majority of patients. However, there is a dearth of accompanying liver histologic studies in these patients. METHODS: The current report details the clinical courses of 2 patients having severe COVID-19 hepatitis. Liver biopsies were analyzed under light microscopy, portions of liver tissue were hybridized with a target probe to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 S gene, and small sections from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded liver tissue were processed for electron microscopy. RESULTS: The liver histology of both cases showed a mixed inflammatory infiltrate with prominent bile duct damage, endotheliitis, and many apoptotic bodies. In situ hybridization and electron microscopy suggest the intrahepatic presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, the findings of which may indicate the possibility of direct cell injury. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the abundant apoptosis and severe cholangiocyte injury, these histopathologic changes suggest a direct cytopathic injury. Furthermore, some of the histopathologic changes may resemble acute cellular rejection occurring after liver transplantation. These 2 cases demonstrate that severe COVID-19 hepatitis can occur even in the absence of significant involvement of other organs.","Fiel, M Isabel; El Jamal, Siraj M; Paniz-Mondolfi, Alberto; Gordon, Ronald E; Reidy, Jason; Bandovic, Jela; Advani, Rashmi; Kilaru, Saikiran; Pourmand, Kamron; Ward, Stephen; Thung, Swan N; Schiano, Thomas",Cell Mol.

This study highlights the biological engineering courses at the University of the Republic (Universidad de la Republica) in Uruguay pertaining to the adaptations to virtual learning environments during the COVID-19 pandemic and analyzing its impact through the courses taught in the virtual setting. Design/methodology/approach Global education has seen a significant paradigm shift over the last few years, changing from a specialized approach to a broader transdisciplinary approach. Especially in life sciences, different fields of specializations have started to share a common space in the area of applied research and development. Based on this transdisciplinary approach, the Biological Engineering program was designed at the University of the Republic (Universidad de la Republica), Uruguay. Findings The new challenges posed by the virtual modality on the pedagogical areas like course design, teaching methodologies and evaluations and logistical aspects like laboratory-setting have sparked a considerable change in different aspects of the courses. However, despite the changes to virtual modality in this year, the student-performance showed an overall improvement compared to the last year. Originality/value With the changing direction of pedagogy and research in biological engineering across the world, it is quintessential to adapt university courses to the same, promoting an environment where the scientific and engineering disciplines merge and the learning methodologies lead to a dynamic and adaptive ubiquitous learning environment.","Simoes, C.; Chatterjee, P.; Lemes, L.

Here, we evaluated infection control measures in a prospective longitudinal single-center study at the Vienna General Hospital, the biggest tertiary care center in Austria, with a structurally planned low SARS-CoV-2 exposure. SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were assessed by Abbott ARCHITECT chemiluminescent assay (CLIA) in 599 health care workers (HCWs) at the start of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in early April and two months later. Neutralization assay confirmed CLIA-positive samples. A structured questionnaire was completed at both visits assessing demographic parameters, family situation, travel history, occupational coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exposure, and personal protective equipment handling. At the first visit, 6 of 599 participants (1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. The seroprevalence increased to 1.5% (8/553) at the second visit and did not differ depending on the working environment. Unprotected SARS-CoV-2 exposure (p = 0.003), positively tested family members (p = 0.04), and travel history (p = 0.09) were more frequently reported by positively tested HCWs. Odds for COVID-19 related symptoms were highest for congestion or runny nose (p = 0.002) and altered taste or smell (p < 0.001). In conclusion, prevention strategies proved feasible in reducing the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from patients and among HCWs in a low incidence hospital, not exceeding the one described in the general population.","Schubert, Lorenz; Strassl, Robert; Burgmann, Heinz; Dvorak, Gabriella; Karer, Matthias; Kundi, Michael; Kussmann, Manuel; Lagler, Heimo; Lötsch, Felix; Milacek, Christopher; Obermueller, Markus; Oesterreicher, Zoe; Steininger, Christoph; Stiasny, Karin; Thalhammer, Florian; Traby, Ludwig; Vass, Zoltan; Vossen, Matthias Gerhard; Weseslindtner, Lukas; Winkler, Stefan; Tobudic, Selma",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,110

A real-time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is the main method and has been regarded as the gold standard for diagnosing the COVID-19. Strict requirements and the limited supply of RT-PCR kits for the laboratory environment leads to delay in the accurate diagnosis of patients in addition to the test takes 4-6 hours to obtain the results. To tackle this problem, radiological images such as chest X-rays and CT scan could be the answer to test the COVID-19 infection rapidly and more efficiently. In this paper, an efficient proposed Convolution Neural Network (CNN) architecture model for COVID-19 detection based on chest X-ray images is presented. The proposed model is developed to provide accurate detection for binary classification (Normal vs. COVID-19), three class classification (Normal vs. COVID-19 vs. Pneumonia), and four class classification (Normal vs. COVID-19 vs. Pneumonia vs. Tuberculosis (TB)). Our proposed model produced an overall testing accuracy of 99.7%, 95.02%, and 94.53% for binary, three, and four class classifications, respectively.

Nevertheless, their rapid development did not allow for testing among specific population subgroups such as pregnant and breastfeeding women, or elaborating specific guidelines for healthcare personnel working in high infection risk specialties, such as otolaryngology (ORL). This clinical consensus statement (CCS) aims to offer guidance for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination to this high-risk population based on the best evidence available. METHODS: A multidisciplinary international panel of 33 specialists judged statements through a two-round modified Delphi method survey. Statements were designed to encompass the following topics: risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection and use of protective equipment in ORL; SARS-Cov-2 infection and vaccines and respective risks for the mother/child dyad; and counseling for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in pregnant, breastfeeding, or fertile healthcare workers (PBFHW). All ORL PBFHW were considered as the target audience. RESULTS: Of the 13 statements, 7 reached consensus or strong consensus, 2 reached no consensus, and 2 reached near-consensus. According to the statements with strong consensus otorhinolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or with childbearing potential should have the opportunity to receive SARS-Cov-2 vaccination. Moreover, personal protective equipment (PPE) should still be used even after the vaccination. CONCLUSION: Until prospective evaluations on these topics are available, ORL-HNS must be considered a high infection risk specialty. While the use of PPE remains pivotal, ORL PBFHW should be allowed access to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination provided they receive up-to-date information.","Saibene, Alberto Maria; Allevi, Fabiana; Ayad, Tareck; Baudoin, Tomislav; Bernal-Sprekelsen, Manuel; Briganti, Giovanni; Carrie, Sean; Cayé-Thomasen, Per; Dahman Saidi, Sara; Dauby, Nicolas; Fenton, John; Golusinski, Wojciech; Klimek, Ludger; Leclerc, Andrée-Anne; Longtin, Yves; Mannelli, Giuditta; Mayo-Yáñez, Miguel; Meço, Cem; Metwaly, Osama; Mouawad, François; Niemczyk, Kazimierz; Pedersen, Ulrik; Piersiala, Krzysztof; Plzak, Jan; Remacle, Marc; Rommel, Nathalie; Saleh, Hesham; Szpecht, Dawid; Tedla, Miroslav; Tincati, Camilla; Tucciarone, Manuel; Zelenik, Karol; Lechien, Jerome R",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,110

394955,COVID-19 pandemic and medical education: A medical student's perspective,2020,"BACKGROUND: The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on healthcare has led to rapid changes in otolaryngology service provisions. As such, new standard operating procedures for the management of suspected tonsillitis or quinsy were implemented in our centre. METHODS: A retrospective audit was performed of acute referrals to ENT of patients with suspected tonsillitis, peritonsillar cellulitis or quinsy, during the 10 weeks before (group 1) and 10 weeks after (group 2) implementation of the new standard operating procedures. RESULTS: Group 2 received fewer referrals. Fewer nasendoscopies were performed and corticosteroid use was reduced. The frequency of quinsy drainage performed under local anaesthetic increased, although the difference was not statistically significant. Hospital admission rates decreased from 56.1 to 20.4 per cent, and mean length of stay increased from 1.13 to 1.5 days. Face-to-face follow up decreased from 15.0 to 8.2 per cent, whilst virtual follow up increased from 4.7 to 16.3 per cent. There were no significant differences in re-presentation or re-admission rates. CONCLUSION: Management of suspected tonsillitis or quinsy using the new standard operating procedures appears to be safe and effective. This management should now be applied to an out-patient setting in otherwise systemically well patients.","Cereceda-Monteoliva, N; Devabalan, Y; Lorenz, H; Magill, J C; Unadkat, S; Rennie, C",J Laryngol Otol,,110

In observing a significant anniversary of this journal, which sits at the junction of education and healthcare systems, it is appropriate to reflect on how the relationship is evolving. Health professions educators must listen to the voices of regulators, employers, students and patients when adapting to new service delivery models that emerge in response to pressures for change. The recent COVID-19 pandemic is one example of disruptive change, but other factors, such as population pressures and climate change, can also drive innovations that result in lasting change. Emerging technology may act as either a servant of change or a disruptor.

Clinical and epidemiological studies have shown that vitamin D deficiency can be linked to an increased risk of viral infection, including COVID-19. Therefore, in this review, we looked at various possible roles of vitamin D in reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection and severity. We describe in this article that individuals at high risk of vitamin D deficiency should consider taking vitamin D supplements to keep optimal concentrations. Moreover, we discuss different possible mechanisms by which vitamin D can efficiently reduce the risk of infections through modulation of innate and adaptive immunity against various types of infections. It is advisable to perform further studies addressing the observed influence of vitamin D levels to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection and mortality.","Hetta, H F; Muhammad, K; El-Masry, E A; Taha, A E; Ahmed, E A; Phares, C; Kader, H A; Waheed, Y; Zahran, A M; Yahia, R; Meshaal, A Kh; El-Saber Batiha, G",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,110

About 20% of COVID-19 patients exhibit moderate to severe symptoms. Severe COVID-19 manifests as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with elevated plasma proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 1ß (IL-1ß), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor &#945; (TNF-&#945;), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10/IP10), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1&#945;), and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), with low levels of interferon type I (IFN-I) in the early stage and elevated levels of IFN-I during the advanced stage of COVID-19. Most of the severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients have had preexisting comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory diseases. These conditions are known to perturb the levels of cytokines, chemokines, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an essential receptor involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells. ACE2 downregulation during SARS-CoV-2 infection activates the angiotensin II/angiotensin receptor (AT1R)-mediated hypercytokinemia and hyperinflammatory syndrome. However, several SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including open reading frame 3b (ORF3b), ORF6, ORF7, ORF8, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, can inhibit IFN type I and II (IFN-I and -II) production. Thus, hyperinflammation, in combination with the lack of IFN responses against SARS-CoV-2 early on during infection, makes the patients succumb rapidly to COVID-19. Therefore, therapeutic approaches involving anti-cytokine/anti-cytokine-signaling and IFN therapy would favor the disease prognosis in COVID-19.

402667,COVID-19 pandemic-testing times for post graduate medical education,2021,"Mental health issues among college students is a leading public health concern, which seems to have been exacerbating during the COVID-19 pandemic. While previous estimates related to psychological burden among college students are available, quantitative synthesis of available data still needs to be performed. Therefore, this meta-analysis endeavors to present collective evidence discussing the psychological impact of COVID-19 among college students. Bibliographical library databases, including Embase, Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, and PsycINFO, were systematically searched for relevant studies. Titles, abstracts, and full articles were screened, and two reviewers extracted data. Heterogeneity was assessed by I2 statistic. The random-effects model was utilized to obtain the pooled estimates of psychological indicators among college students. Location, gender, level of severity, and quality scores were used as moderator variables for subgroup analyses. Funnel plot and Egger linear regression test was used to assess publication bias. Twenty-seven studies constituting 90,879 college students met the inclusion criteria. The results indicated 39.4% anxiety (95% CI: 28.6, 51.3; I2 = 99.8%; p-value < 0.0001) and 31.2% depression (95% CI: 19.7, 45.6; I2= 99.8%, p < 0.0001) among college students. The pooled prevalence of stress (26.0%), post-traumatic stress disorder (29.8%), and impaired sleep quality (50.5%) were also reported. College students bear a disproportionate burden of mental health problems worldwide, with females having higher anxiety and depression levels than males. This study''s findings underscore the need to develop appropriate public health interventions to address college students' emotional and psychosocial needs. The policies should be reflective of demographic and socioeconomic differentials.","Batra, Kavita; Sharma, Manoj; Batra, Ravi; Singh, Tejinder Pal; Schvaneveldt, Nena",,,110
403919,A urgência da Saúde Coletiva na formação em Educação Física: lições com o COVID-19/ The urgency of Public Health in Physical Education training: lessons from COVID-19,2020,"IMPORTANCE: During pandemics Agent Based Models (ABMs) can model complex, fine-grained behavioural interactions occurring in social networks, that contribute to disease transmission by novel viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVE: We present a new agent-based model (ABM) called the Discrete-Event, Simulated Social Agent based Network Transmission model (DESSABNeT) and demonstrate its ability to model the spread of COVID-19 in large cities like Sydney, Melbourne and Gold Coast. Our aim was to validate the model with its disease dynamics and underlying social network. DESIGN: DESSABNeT relies on disease transmission within simulated social networks. It employs an epidemiological SEIRD+M (Susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered, died and managed) structure. One hundred simulations were run for each city, with simulated social restrictions closely modelling real restrictions imposed in each location. MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S): The mean predicted daily incidence of COVID-19 cases were compared to real case incidence data for each city. Reff and health service utilisation outputs were compared to the literature, or for the Gold Coast with daily incidence of hospitalisation. RESULTS: DESSABNeT modelled multiple physical distancing restrictions and predicted epidemiological outcomes of Sydney, Melbourne and the Gold Coast, validating this model for future simulation work. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: DESSABNeT is a valid platform to model the spread of COVID-19 in large cities in Australia and potentially internationally. The platform is suitable to model different combinations of social restrictions, or to model contact tracing, predict, and plan for, the impact on hospital and ICU admissions, and deaths; and also the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and optimal social restrictions during vaccination.","Stapelberg, Nicolas J C; Smoll, Nicolas R; Randall, Marcus; Palipana, Dinesh; Bui, Bryan; Macartney, Kristine; Khandaker, Gulam; Wattiaux, Andre",PLoS One,,110

404837,Homeless Shelter Flows in Calgary and the Potential Impact of COVID-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Growing evidence has been published as to the impact of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) on cerebrovascular events over the last few months, with considerable attention paid to ischemic strokes. Conversely, little is known about the clinical course of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) and simultaneous SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHOD: The Italian Society of Hospital Neurosciences (SNO) promoted a multicentre, retrospective, observational study (SNO-COVID-19), involving 20 Neurological Departments in Northern Italy. Clinical data on patients with acute cerebrovascular diseases, admitted from March 1st to April 30th, 2020, were collected. A comparison was made of the demographical and clinical features of both SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients with ICH. RESULTS: 949 patients were enrolled (average age 73.4 years; 52.7% males); 135 patients had haemorrhagic stroke and 127 (13.4%) had a primary ICH. Only 16 patients with ICH (12.6%) had laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, both symptomatic and asymptomatic. SARS-CoV-2 related pneumonia or respiratory distress (OR 5.4), lobar location (OR 5.0) and previous antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment (OR 2.9) were the only factors significantly associated with increased mortality in ICH. SARS-CoV-2 infection, regardless of respiratory involvement, led to a non-significantly increased risk of in-hospital death (37.5% vs 23.4%, p = 0.2). DISCUSSION: ICH patients with COVID-19 did not experience an increase in mortality as striking as ischemic stroke. The inflammatory response and respiratory complications could justify the slight increase of death in ICH. Bleeding sites and previous antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment were the only other predictors of a worse outcome.","Sangalli, Davide; Martinelli-Boneschi, Filippo; Versino, Maurizio; Colombo, Irene; Ciccone, Alfonso; Beretta, Simone; Marcheselli, Simona; Altavilla, Riccardo; Roncoroni, Mauro; Beretta, Sandro; Lorusso, Lorenzo; Cavallini, Anna; Prelle, Alessandro; Guidetti, Donata; La Gioia, Sara; Santalucia, Paola; Zanferrari, Carla; Grampa, Giampiero; D039,; Adda, Elisabetta; Peverelli, Lorenzo; Colombo, Antonio; Salmaggi, Andrea",J Neurol Sci,,110
405971,COVID-19: Cuidados de Enfermagem em Unidade de Terapia Intensiva/ COVID-19: Nursing Care in an Intensive Care Unit,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19, as a newly-emerged viral infection has now spread all over the world after originating in Wuhan, China. Pneumonia is the hallmark of the disease, with dyspnea in half of the patients and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in up to one -third of the cases. Pulmonary edema, neutrophilic infiltration, and inflammatory cytokine release are the pathologic signs of this disease. The anti-inflammatory effect of the photobiomodulation (PBM) has been confirmed in many previous studies. Therefore, this review study was conducted to evaluate the direct effect of PBM on the acute lung inflammation or ARDS and also accelerating the regeneration of the damaged tissues. The indirect effects of PBM on modulation of the immune system, increasing the blood flow and oxygenation in other tissues were also considered. METHODOLOGY: The databases of PubMed, Cochrane library, and Google Scholar were searched to find the relevant studies. Keywords included the PBM and related terms, lung inflammation, and COVID-19 -related signs. Studies were categorized with respect to the target tissue, laser parameters, and their results. RESULTS: Seventeen related papers were included in this review. All of them were in animal models. They showed that the PBM could significantly decrease the pulmonary edema, neutrophil influx, and generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1ß), interleukin 6 (IL-6), intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM), reactive oxygen species (ROS), isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2)). CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed that the PBM could be helpful in reducing the lung inflammation and promoting the regeneration of the damaged tissue. PBM can increase the oxygenation indirectly in order to rehabilitate the affected organs. Thus, the infra-red lasers or light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are recommended in this regard.","Nejatifard, Marzieh; Asefi, Sohrab; Jamali, Raika; Hamblin, Michael R; Fekrazad, Reza",Cytokine,,110

411486,Life experience and resources for overcoming the difficulties of social isolation in the first period of the COVID-19 pandemic among students,2021,"The incidence and mortality of COVID-19, according to the World Health Organization reports, shows a noticeable difference between North America, Western Europe, and South Asia on one hand and most African countries on the other hand, especially the malaria-endemic countries. Although this observation could be attributed to limited testing capacity, mitigation tools adopted and cultural habits, many theories have been postulated to explain this difference in prevalence and mortality. Because death tends to occur more in elders, both the role of demography, and how the age structure of a population may contribute to the difference in mortality rate between countries were discussed. The variable distribution of the ACEI/D and the ACE2 (C1173T substitution) polymorphisms has been postulated to explain this variable prevalence. Up-to-date data regarding the role of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ) in COVID-19 have been summarized. The article also sheds lights on how the similarity of malaria and COVID-19 symptoms can lead to misdiagnosis of one disease for the other or overlooking the possibility of co-infection. As the COVID-19 pandemic threatens the delivery of malaria services, such as the distribution of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), indoor residual spraying, as well as malaria chemoprevention there is an urgent need for rapid and effective responses to avoid malaria outbreaks.","Hussein, Mogahed Ismail Hassan; Albashir, Ahmed Abdalazim Dafallah; Elawad, Omer Ali Mohamed Ahmed; Homeida, Anmar",Malar J,,110

412541,"Social distancing, use of face masks and hand washing among participants in the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging: the ELSI-COVID-19 initiative",2020,"Cotton fabrics with durable and reusable daylight-induced antibacterial/antiviral functions were developed by using a novel fabrication process, which employs strong electrostatic interaction between cationic cotton fibers and anionic photosensitizers. The cationic cotton contains polycationic short chains produced by a self-propagation of 2-diehtylaminoehtyl chloride (DEAE-Cl) on the surface of cotton fibers. Then, the fabric (i.e., polyDEAE@cotton) can be readily functionalized with anionic photosensitizers like rose Bengal and sodium 2-anthraquinone sulfate to produce biocidal reactive oxygen species (ROS) under light exposure and consequently provide the photo-induced biocidal functions. The biocidal properties of the photo-induced fabrics (PIFs) were demonstrated by ROS production measurements, bactericidal performance against bacteria (e.g., E coli and L. innocua), and antiviral results against T7 bacteriophage. The PIFs achieved 99.9999% (6 log) reductions against bacteria and the bacteriophage within 60 min of daylight exposure. Moreover, the PIFs showcase excellent washability and photostability, making them ideal materials for reusable face masks and protective suits with improved biological protections compared with traditional PPE. This work demonstrated that the cationized cotton could serve as a platform for different functionalization applications, and the resulting fiber materials could inspire the development of reusable and sustainable PPE with significant bioprotective properties to fight the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the spread of other contagious diseases.","Tang, Peixin; Zhang, Zheng; El-Moghazy, Ahmed Y; Wisuthiphaet, Nicharee; Nitin, Nitin; Sun, Gang",ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,,110

A total of 27 oral communications were distributed in 8 sessions with topics ranging from molecular and cellular functions of VPS13 genes and proteins, their involvement in Neuroacanthocytosis Syndromes and finally clinical aspects and patients care. In addition, 5 posters were presented. Altogether, scientists and neurologists discussed recent advances and set the bases for next steps, action points, and future studies in close collaboration with the patients associations, which are always actively involved in the whole process.","Masana, Merc; Rodrguez, Manuel J; Alberch, Jordi",Tremor Other Hyperkinet Mov (N Y),,110
416386,Regulatory behavior in the COVID-19 pandemic: How to get students to comply with it?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Tumor grade and RET mutation status, especially presence of high-risk exon 15 and 16 RET mutations, have been reported to be prognostic in sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). The aim of our study was to evaluate the performance of two recently proposed grading systems and to assess the association between grade and genotype in a cohort of sporadic MTC. DESIGN: We identified 44 sporadic MTC. All available tumor slides were examined, and cases were assigned a grade based on either mitotic count and tumor necrosis or mitotic count, tumor necrosis, and Ki-67 proliferative index, as described in two recent studies. Additional clinicopathologic features and outcome information were obtained from the pathology reports and electronic medical records. Presence of RET and RAS mutations were determined either by direct sequencing or massively parallel sequencing. RESULTS: Both grading systems were prognostic for progression-free survival and disease-specific survival on univariate analysis. There was no correlation between grade and mutation status. Specifically, neither RET nor high-risk RET mutations were enriched in high-grade tumors, as assessed by either grading scheme. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that grade is not correlated with RET/RAS mutation status, indicating that grade and genotype may give independent prognostic information.","Najdawi, Fedaa; Ahmadi, Sara; Capelletti, Marzia; Dong, Fei; Chau, Nicole G; Barletta, Justine A",Histopathology,,110
417350,"When the rally-around-the-flag effect disappears, or: when the COVID-19 pandemic becomes ""normalized""",2021,"BACKGROUND: Schools are socially dense environments, and school-based outbreaks often predate and fuel community-wide transmission of seasonal and pandemic influenza. While preemptive school closures can effectively reduce influenza transmission, they are disruptive and currently recommended only for pandemics. We assessed the feasibility of implementing other social distancing practices in K-12 schools as a first step in seeking an alternative to preemptive school closures. METHODS: We conducted 36 focus groups with education and public health officials across the United States. We identified and characterized themes and compared feasibility of practices by primary versus secondary school and region of the United States. RESULTS: Participants discussed 29 school practices (25 within-school practices implemented as part of the school day and 4 reduced-schedule practices that impact school hours). Participants reported that elementary schools commonly implement several within-school practices as part of routine operations such as homeroom stay, restriction of hall movement, and staggering of recess times. Because of routine implementation and limited use of individualized schedules within elementary schools, within-school practices were generally felt to be more feasible for elementary schools than secondary schools. Of reduced-schedule practices, shortening the school week and the school day was considered the most feasible; however, reduced-schedule practices were generally perceived to be less feasible than within-school practices for all grade levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that schools have many options to increase social distance other than closing. Future research should evaluate which of these seemingly feasible practices are effective in reducing influenza transmission in schools and surrounding communities.","Uscher-Pines, Lori; Schwartz, Heather L; Ahmed, Faruque; Zheteyeva, Yenlik; Tamargo Leschitz, Jennifer; Pillemer, Francesca; Faherty, Laura; Uzicanin, Amra",J Public Health Manag Pract,,110
417467,Factors influencing adoption of online teaching by school teachers: A study during COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Cigarette smoking among postpartum women remains a significant public health problem despite known health risks to women and their newborns. It is estimated that over 50% of women quit smoking during pregnancy but 90% relapse by one year. Safe and effective postpartum relapse prevention strategies are urgently needed. In an attempt to address this deficit, we will investigate the efficacy of bupropion vs. placebo as a smoking relapse prevention aid in postpartum women. The objective of this paper is to detail an approach to investigate bupropion's efficacy for preventing postpartum smoking relapse among women who quit smoking during pregnancy. Specifically, we designed a two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial testing the efficacy of bupropion vs. placebo as a relapse prevention tool. Mothers of healthy infants who quit smoking while pregnant will be stratified based on current or past history of major depressive disorder or persistent depressive disorder and randomized to receive either active (bupropion XL 300 mg/day) or placebo medication for 12 weeks. To respond to safety concerns associated with participant and staff exposure to COVID-19, we revised our original protocol and present procedures which allow our trial to be conducted entirely remotely. Primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed at weeks 12, 24, 36 and 52 post-randomization. The primary outcome is 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 24 weeks. Results of this work have the potential to positively impact women and their children by promoting lifelong cessation, eliminating secondhand smoke exposure, and modelling of abstinence to children.","Allen, Sharon; Thomas, Janet; Harrison, Katherine; Emery, Rebecca L; Petersen, Ashley; Winickoff, Jonathan P; Japuntich, Sandra",Contemp Clin Trials,,110

417897,The role of workplace accommodations in explaining the disability employment gap in the UK,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic might increase suicide behaviors. However, results are still limited and inconclusive, especially in adolescents. METHODS: To provide a preliminary evidence of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide attempts (SA), we compared data from the Catalonia Suicide Risk Code (CRSC), during the first 12 months of Spain COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020 to March 2021) with data of the previous 12 months (March 2019 to March 2020). The CRSC is a well-established population-based registry of suicide attempts (SA) which allows monitoring of the dynamic changes that COVID-19 may produce in a Spanish region. RESULTS: SA among adolescents increased 25% during the COVID-year, whatever, SA among adults decreased 16,5% in the same period. The increase of SA in girls was especially prominent in the starting school period in the COVID-year (September 2020-March 2021), where the increase reached 195%. LIMITATIONS: This study did not evaluate other individual risk factors of SA in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, so is unable to make concrete causal inferences. CONCLUSIONS: These finding suggest that SA increased in adolescent girls during the last period of the COVID-19 pandemic, underscoring the need to implement effective preventive measures by public health systems and stakeholders into response during this public health crisis.","Gracia, Rebeca; Pamias, Montse; Mortier, Philippe; Alonso, Jordi; Pérez, Víctor; Palao, Diego",J Affect Disord,,110
419572,"Confirmatory Factor Analysis, Internal Consistency, Gender Differential Item Functioning and Discriminant Validity of the Fear of COVID-5 Scale Amidst Emerging Adult University Students in Mexico",2021,"OBJECTIVE: Video-based depictions of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) can be useful for educational purposes, but many of the readily available resources may worsen already stigmatized views of the procedure. Educators' common reliance on such material highlights the paucity of equipoised depictions of modern ECT well suited for the training of health professionals. The authors developed and tested a new educational module enhanced by videotaped depictions of a simulated patient undergoing the consent, treatment, recovery, and follow-up phases of ECT. METHODS: The didactic intervention interspersed 7 short video clips (totaling 14 min) into a 55-min lecture on treatment-resistant depression. The session, part of an intensive course of preclinical psychiatry, was delivered online through synchronous videoconferencing with Zoom. The primary outcome measure was change in the Questionnaire on Attitudes and Knowledge of ECT (QuAKE). RESULTS: Fifty-three out of 63 (87%) eligible second-year medical students completed assessments at baseline and after exposure to the didactic intervention. QuAKE scores improved between baseline and endpoint: the Attitudes composite increased from 49.4 ± 6.1 to 59.1 ± 5.7 (paired t 10.65, p < 0.001, Cohen's d 0.69), and the Knowledge composite from 13.3 ± 1.2 to 13.9 ± 0.8 (paired t 3.97, p < 0.001, Cohen's d 0.23). CONCLUSIONS: These video-based educational materials proved easy to implement in the virtual classroom, were amenable to adaptation by end-use instructors, were well received by learners, and led to measurable changes in students' knowledge of and attitudes toward ECT.","Kitay, Brandon; Martin, Andrés; Chilton, Julie; Amsalem, Doron; Duvivier, Robbert; Goldenberg, Matthew",Acad. psychiatry,,110

The immune response elicited from this virus is poorly understood. An alarming number of cases have arisen where COVID-19 patients develop complications on top of the symptoms already associated with SARS, such as thrombosis, injuries of vascular system, kidney, and liver, as well as Kawasaki disease. In this review, we have used a bioinformatics approach to elucidate the immune response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection in primary human lung epithelial and transformed human lung alveolar. Additionally, we have examined the potential mechanism behind several complications that have been associated with COVID-19 and determined that a specific cytokine storm is leading to excessive neutrophil recruitment. These neutrophils are directly leading to thrombosis, organ damage, and complement activation via neutrophil extracellular trap release.","Maxwell, Anthony J; Ding, Jiahui; You, Yuan; Dong, Zhong; Chehade, Hussein; Alvero, Ayesha; Mor, Yechiel; Draghici, Sorin; Mor, Gil",J. leukoc. biol,,110

422576,COVID-19 pandemic: Beyond medical education in Brazil,2020,"Since excessive use of synthetic dyes has negative effects on human health, their determination in foodstuff is necessary. A sensitive sensor was developed based on copper BTC metal-organic framework (Cu-BTC MOF) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride as an ionic liquid (IL) in an attempt to modify the carbon paste electrode and to improve the active surface area and electric conductivity so that electron transfer is faster for electro analysis. For the first time, high sensitivity, excellent conductivity, and appropriate selectivity of the electrochemical sensor have been evaluated as a new study for simultaneous determination of tartrazine, patent blue V, acid violet 7 and ponceau 4R. Excellent sensing performance of the proposed electrode was confirmed for patent blue V as an outstanding sensor, according to the low limit of detection of 0.07 µM, with a wide linear concentration range of 0.08 to 900 µM and reasonable recovery. In order to characterize the electrochemical behavior of electrode, cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy are used. Various techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-Ray analysis (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) are employed to verify the structure of copper BTC metal-organic framework. The results revealed close packing of hierarchically porous nanoparticles and crystal structure of Cu-BTC MOF, with the edge of each particle around 20-37 nm. The analytical performance of the suggested electrochemical sensor is acceptable in foodstuffs such as jellies, condiments, soft drinks, and candies.","Darabi, Rozhin; Shabani-Nooshabadi, Mehdi; Karimi-Maleh, Hassan; Gholami, Ali",Food Chem,,110
422716,COVID-19 Pandemic: Medical Education Is Clinging on a Knife's Edge!,2020,"Government response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic promises to entrench austerity politics deeper into the organization of academic life, and audit regimes are the likely means of achieving this. Redoubled efforts to understand the operation of audit as a strategic technology of control are therefore clearly a priority. A distinctly anthropological literature has emerged over recent years to analyse and understand audit culture in academia, but what seems to be missing are analyses capable of bringing the disparate techniques experienced in academic audit together into coherent technologies, and identifying how these technologies thereby constitute a distinct audit regime within the broader audit culture. While the anthropological literature implicitly calls for further historical and conceptual exploration of the rationality to these techniques, what is required is the translation of our understanding of audit rationality into a presentation of the concrete techniques of control as they are experienced, so that more effective counter-conducts and resistances can be conceived. This article indicates how an excursion into the Soviet Gulag, and the political technology of the ?camp? that is its principal apparatus, can reveal not merely how the techniques of audit operate, but also indicate how those techniques might be engaged tactically in the academic setting. This kind of analogic analysis can allow us to understand audit in ways more promising for resistance to its idiomatic power, replacing demoralized and helpless resignation with inspirational exempla. Politically, the article argues that ?techniques of the self? are not only necessary to engage audit techniques through particular kinds of counter-conduct, but how these counter-conducts are contributory to the organized and concerted kind of resistance that we so desperately desire. The practice of tukhta is singled out and introduced as an illustrative means for combining survival strategies with the development of critical rationality in praxis.","Welsh, John",Anthropological Theory,,110

Reports from healthcare institutions in different countries show a variety of crisis exit strategies. METHODS: The following is a review and update of the situation and crisis management in Zürich and Switzerland with a special focus on the impact on the cardiac surgery program and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)-therapy in COVID-19. RESULTS: Regional and national measures had avoided the collapse of the health system in Switzerland. There was a reduction of over 50% of the surgical and transcatheter caseload during the first wave of the pandemic. Twenty-three ECMO devices, 150 oxygenators, and more than 300 different cannulas were at our disposal. Between March and May 2020, nine COVID-19 patients were treated by us with ECMO-therapy. Three patients were transported by us from distant institutions. Median age at ECMO implantation was 59 years. Two patients died on support. CONCLUSIONS: Measures to prevent a collapse of the healthcare system were effective.

A highly elevated levels of cytokines in COVID-19 patients requiring ICU admission, has suggested that a “cytokine storm” was associated with disease severity. Methods: We summarize published key findings about imatinib, aiming to rationalize its use as a potential pharmacologic treatment for COVID-19. Results: Data from cellular, animal models and clinical trials, showed a beneficial role of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the regulation of inflammation, the maintenance of endothelial barrier integrity, as well as the expression of antiviral properties. This data is especially derived from imatinib, the most studied Abl family kinase inhibitor, that is currently in clinical use for multiple medical conditions. Discussion: Based on this encouraging data, we hypothesize that imatinib might be beneficial for the treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, in the aim of preventing disease progression into the severe phenotype of hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome. This concept can be considered for evaluation in a randomized controlled study.","ASSAAD, Hany Samir; ASSAAD-KHALIL, Samir",Alex. J. Med.,,110

423814,Online Synchronous Clinical Communication Training During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The global numbers of confirmed cases and deceased critically ill patients with COVID-19 are increasing. However, the clinical course, and the 60-day mortality and its predictors in critically ill patients have not been fully elucidated. The aim of this study is to identify the clinical course, and 60-day mortality and its predictors in critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Critically ill adult patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) from 3 hospitals in Wuhan, China, were included. Data on demographic information, preexisting comorbidities, laboratory findings at ICU admission, treatments, clinical outcomes, and results of SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests and of serum SARS-CoV-2 IgM were collected including the duration between symptom onset and negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS: Of 1748 patients with COVID-19, 239 (13.7%) critically ill patients were included. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in 164 (68.6%) patients, coagulopathy in 150 (62.7%) patients, acute cardiac injury in 103 (43.1%) patients, and acute kidney injury (AKI) in 119 (49.8%) patients, which occurred 15.5 days, 17 days, 18.5 days, and 19 days after the symptom onset, respectively. The median duration of the negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was 30 (range 6-81) days in 49 critically ill survivors that were identified. A total of 147 (61.5%) patients deceased by 60 days after ICU admission. The median duration between ICU admission and decease was 12 (range 3-36). Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis revealed that age older than 65 years, thrombocytopenia at ICU admission, ARDS, and AKI independently predicted the 60-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Severe complications are common and the 60-day mortality of critically ill patients with COVID-19 is considerably high. The duration of the negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and its association with the severity of critically ill patients with COVID-19 should be seriously considered and further studied.","Xu, Jiqian; Yang, Xiaobo; Yang, Luyu; Zou, Xiaojing; Wang, Yaxin; Wu, Yongran; Zhou, Ting; Yuan, Yin; Qi, Hong; Fu, Shouzhi; Liu, Hong; Xia, Jia039; an,; Xu, Zhengqin; Yu, Yuan; Li, Ruiting; Ouyang, Yaqi; Wang, Rui; Ren, Lehao; Hu, Yingying; Xu, Dan; Zhao, Xin; Yuan, Shiying; Zhang, Dingyu; Shang, You",Crit Care,,110

426923,What If I Told You the COVID-19 Pandemic Is Not Entirely Bad?,2020,"One challenge in point-of-care (POC) diagnostics is the lack of room-temperature methods for RNA detection based on enzymatic amplification and visualization steps. Here we perform reverse transcription lesion-induced DNA amplification (RT-LIDA), an isothermal amplification method that only requires T4 DNA ligase. RT-LIDA involves the RNA-templated ligation of DNA primers to form complementary DNA (cDNA) followed by toehold-mediated strand displacement of the cDNA and its exponential amplification via our isothermal ligase chain reaction LIDA. Each step is tuned to proceed at 28 °C, which falls within the range of global room temperatures. Using RT-LIDA, we can detect as little as â¼100 amol target RNA and can distinguish RNA target from total cellular RNA. Finally, we demonstrate that the resulting DNA amplicons can be detected colorimetrically, also at room temperature, by rapid, target-triggered disassembly of DNA-modified gold nanoparticles. This integrated amplification/detection platform requires no heating or visualization instrumentation, which is an important step towards realizing instrument-free POC testing.","Alladin-Mustan, B Safeenaz; Liu, Yuning; Li, Yimeng; de Almeida, Daria R Q; Yuzik, Jesse; Mendes, Camilla F; Gibbs, Julianne M",Anal Chim Acta,,110
426945,Considerations Relating to Social Distancing Measures in Response to COVID-19 - Second Update,2020,"BACKGROUND: To investigate the CT changes of different clinical types of COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: This retrospective study included 50 patients with COVID-19 from 16 January 2020 to 25 February 2020. We analyzed the clinical characteristics, CT characteristics and the pneumonia involvement of the patients between the moderate group and the severe and critical group, and the dynamic changes of severity with the CT follow-up time. RESULTS: There were differences in the CT severity score of the right lung in the initial CT, and total CT severity score in the initial and follow-up CT between the moderate group and the severe and critical group (all p < 0.05). There was a quadratic relationship between total CT severity score and CT follow-up time in the severe and critical group (r2 = 0.137, p = 0.008), the total CT severity score peaked at the second follow-up CT. There was no correlation between total CT severity score and CT follow-up time in the moderate group (p > 0.05). There were no differences in the occurrence rate of CT characteristics in the initial CT between the two groups (all p > 0.05). There were differences in the occurrence rate of ground-glass opacity and crazy-paving pattern in the second follow-up CT, and pleural thickening or adhesion in the third follow-up CT between the two groups (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The CT changes of COVID-19 pneumonia with different severity were different, and the extent of pneumonia involvement by CT can help to assess the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia rather than the initial CT characteristics.","Liu, Nian; He, Guanghong; Yang, Xiongxiong; Chen, Jianxin; Wu, Jie; Ma, Min; Lu, Wenying; Li, Qiang; Cheng, Tao; Huang, Xiaohua",BMC Med Imaging,,110

431424,Students’ opinions about studying from home during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia,2021,"BACKGROUND: On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization's Emergency Committee declared the rapid, worldwide spread of COVID-19 a global health emergency. Since then, tireless efforts have been made to mitigate the spread of the disease and its impact, and these efforts have mostly relied on nonpharmaceutical interventions. By December 2020, the safety and efficacy of the first COVID-19 vaccines were demonstrated. The large social media platform Twitter has been used by medical researchers for the analysis of important public health topics, such as the public's perception on antibiotic use and misuse and human papillomavirus vaccination. The analysis of Twitter-generated data can be further facilitated by using Twitter's built-in, anonymous polling tool to gain insight into public health issues and obtain rapid feedback on an international scale. During the fast-paced course of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Twitter polling system has provided a viable method for gaining rapid, large-scale, international public health insights on highly relevant and timely SARS-CoV-2-related topics. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to understand the public's perception on the safety and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines in real time by using Twitter polls. METHODS: We developed 2 Twitter polls to explore the public's views on available COVID-19 vaccines. The surveys were pinned to the Digital Health and Patient Safety Platform Twitter timeline for 1 week in mid-February 2021, and Twitter users and influencers were asked to participate in and retweet the polls to reach the largest possible audience. RESULTS: The adequacy of COVID-19 vaccine safety (ie, the safety of currently available vaccines; poll 1) was agreed upon by 1579 out of 3439 (45.9%) Twitter users. In contrast, almost as many Twitter users (1434/3439, 41.7%) were unsure about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. Only 5.2% (179/3439) of Twitter users rated the available COVID-19 vaccines as generally unsafe. Poll 2, which addressed the question of whether users would undergo vaccination, was answered affirmatively by 82.8% (2862/3457) of Twitter users, and only 8% (277/3457) categorically rejected vaccination at the time of polling. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the perceived high level of uncertainty about the safety of the available COVID-19 vaccines, we observed an elevated willingness to undergo vaccination among our study sample. Since people's perceptions and views are strongly influenced by social media, the snapshots provided by these media platforms represent a static image of a moving target. Thus, the results of this study need to be followed up by long-term surveys to maintain their validity. This is especially relevant due to the circumstances of the fast-paced pandemic and the need to not miss sudden rises in the incidence of vaccine hesitancy, which may have detrimental effects on the pandemic's course.","Eibensteiner, Fabian; Ritschl, Valentin; Nawaz, Faisal A; Fazel, Sajjad S; Tsagkaris, Christos; Kulnik, Stefan Tino; Crutzen, Rik; Klager, Elisabeth; Völkl-Kernstock, Sabine; Schaden, Eva; Kletecka-Pulker, Maria; Willschke, Harald; Atanasov, Atanas G",J Med Internet Res,,110

Questions/Purposes: We sought to compare the peri-operative outcomes of patients undergoing spine surgery during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to a matched cohort prior to the pandemic. Methods: We identified a consecutive sample of 127 adult patients undergoing spine surgery between March 9, 2020, and April 10, 2020, corresponding with the state of emergency declared in New York and the latest possible time for 1-month surgical follow-up. The study group was matched one-to-one based on age, gender, and body mass index with eligible control patients who underwent similar spine procedures prior to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Surgeries performed for infectious or oncologic indications were excluded. Intra- and post-operative complication rates, re-operations, hospital length of stay, re-admissions, post-operative visit format, development of post-operative fever and/or respiratory symptoms, and SAR-CoV2 testing. Results: A total of 254 patients (127 SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, 127 matched controls) were included. One hundred fifty-eight were male (62%), and 96 were female (38%). The mean age in the pandemic group was 59.8 ± 13.4 years; that of the matched controls was 60.3 ± 12.3. All patients underwent general anesthesia and did not require re-intubation. There were no significant differences in 1-month post-operative complication rates (16.5% pandemic vs. 12.6% control). There was one death in the pandemic group. No patients tested positive for the virus.

This initiative was developed to ensure patients without access to an electronic portal were screened for distress and related symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, these patients could complete screening in clinic. However, many visits transitioned to telehealth. We implemented a standardized telephone outreach process targeting patients without active electronic portal accounts to improve remote symptom monitoring. Outreach resulted in 172 completed screens, identifying 110 needs for 63 individuals. Twenty-eight patients completed patient portal enrollment. Outreach calls captured a higher percentage of Black patients (34%) and a higher percentage of 61-80 year olds (69%) compared to portal users. Telephone outreach during the pandemic captured data that otherwise would have been missed in elderly and minority patients without electronic patient portal access. Patient engagement is vital to the distress screening process.","Davis, Kristina; Wilbur, Kayla; Metzger, Susan; Garcia, Sofia F; Cahue, September; Webster, Kimberly; Lylerohr, Madison; Himelhoch, Heather L; Bilimoria, Karl; Cella, David",J Psychosoc Oncol,,110

Uma análise da desinformação frente à pandemia da Covid-19 no Brasil,2020,"Background: The outbreak of a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) poses a great challenge to global public health. New and effective intervention strategies are urgently needed to combat the disease. Methods: We conducted an open-label, non-randomized, clinical trial involving moderate COVID-19 patients according to study protocol. Patients were assigned in a 1:2 ratio to receive either aerosol inhalation treatment with IFN-&#954; and TFF2, every 48 h for three consecutive dosages, in addition to standard treatment (experimental group), or standard treatment alone (control group). The end point was the time to discharge from the hospital. This study is registered with chictr.org.cn, ChiCTR2000030262. Findings: A total of thirty-three eligible COVID-19 patients were enrolled from February 1, 2020 to April 6, 2020, eleven were assigned to the IFN-&#954; plus TFF2 group, and twenty-two to the control group. Safety and efficacy were evaluated for both groups. No treatment-associated severe adverse effects (SAE) were observed in the group treated with aerosol inhalation of IFN-&#954; plus TFF2, and no significant differences in the safety evaluations were observed between experimental and control groups. CT imaging was performed in all patients with the median improvement time of 5.0 days (IQR 3.0-9.0) in the experimental group versus 8.5 days (IQR 3.0-17.0) in the control group (p<0.05). In addition, the experimental group had a significant shorten median time in cough relief (4.5 days [IQR 2.0-7.0]) than the control group did (10.0 days [IQR 6.0-21.0])(p<0.005), in viral RNA reversion of 6.0 days (IQR 2.0-13.0) in the experimental group vs 9.5 days (IQR 3.0-23.0) in the control group (p < 0.05), and in the median hospitalization stays of 12.0 days (IQR 7.0-20.0) in the experimental group vs 15.0 days (IQR 10.0-25.0) in the control group (p<0.001), respectively. Interpretation: Aerosol inhalation of IFN-&#954; plus TFF2 is a safe treatment and is likely to significantly facilitate clinical improvement, including cough relief, CT imaging improvement, and viral RNA reversion, thereby achieves an early release from hospitalization. These data support to explore a scale-up trial with IFN-&#954; plus TFF2.

A case study during the lockdown caused by Covid-19,2021,"To tackle the harmful consequences of the widespread COVID-19 pandemic, a broad-spectrum anti-viral drug remdesivir (RDV) has gained the utmost attention recently due to its promising application in treating COVID-19 patients. However, a fast and sensitive analytical methodology is important to monitor RDV drug profile in human plasma for pharmacokinetics (PK) and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). In this study, we demonstrate an improved vortex-assisted salt-induced liquid-liquid microextraction (VA-SI-LLME) technique coupled with UHPLC-PDA and UHPLC-MS/MS for rapid determination of RDV in human plasma. This technique involves simple one-step protein precipitation with hydrochloric acid and subsequent extraction with acetonitrile for analysis. Under the optimal VA-SI-LLME conditions (500 µL of acetonitrile with 2.5 g ammonium sulfate under 2 min vortex extraction), method validation results indicated an excellent correlation coefficient of 0.9969 for UHPLC-PDA (monitored at 254 nm) and 0.9990 for UHPLC-MS/MS (monitored at electrospray ionization with + ion mode transitions of m/z 603.1âm/z 402.20 and m/z 603.1â m/z 199.90). The detection and quantification limits were 1.5 and 5 ng/mL for UHPLC/PDA, and 0.3 and 1 ng/mL for UHPLC-MS/MS, respectively. The developed method showed excellent extraction recoveries between 90.79 to 116.74 % and 85.68 to 101.34 % with intraday and interday precision &#8804; 9.59 for both methods. These results proved that the developed method is a simple, fast, and sensitive analytical method that can be applied as a standard analytical tool for PK and TDM studies of RDV in clinical trials during the current worldwide outbreak.","Pasupuleti, Raghavendra Rao; Tsai, Pei-Chien; Ponnusamy, Vinoth Kumar; Pugazhendhi, Arivalagan",Process biochem,,110

METHODS: A web search was performed using the terms ""bioethics; COVID-19; ethics; severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2; emergent care; pandemic; and public health emergencies."" RESULTS: Protection from COVID-19 has resulted in the cancellation of necessary medical interventions, lengthened suffering, and potential non-COVID-19 deaths. Prolonged lockdown reduced well-being, triggering or aggravating mental illnesses and violence, and escalated medical risks. Collateral damage includes restrictions on visitations to hospitals, alienation from the deceased relative, or lack of warm caring of patients. Finally, in a public health crisis, public health interest overrides individual rights if it results in severe harm to the community.

441221,Impact of COVID 19 pandemic on the academics and psychology of final year medical students,2021,"This brief paper summarizes and appraises two prominent psychological accounts of the role fear plays in human life: (1) terror management theory and (2) attachment theory, highlighting research demonstrating that attachment security moderates the experience of fear. Moreover, the suggestion is made that fear of loss of loved ones, and fear of loss of love, is the primary source of fear and anxiety in human life. This paper also highlights the importance and value of showing ‘reflective functioning’ regarding our anxieties or ‘mentalizing’ fear so that we are better prepared for inevitable pandemics in the future. Public health infrastructures must be nourished and reinforced, just as heroic economic and technological changes are needed, so that we may more effectively cope with the fears, destruction and death arising on a regular basis on account of the radical adverse events (hotter and bigger wild fires, longer and more damaging storms) brought on by climate changes, directly linked to foolish and greedy human choices and behaviors.","Steele, Howard",Clin.

So, we aimed to detect the percentage, type, and risk factors of persistent symptoms after improvement from acute COVID-19 infection and to detect the percentage of COVID-19 re-infection and degree of severity of the second infection. One hundred seventy-two (59 male, 113 female) patients who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were followed up via mobile phone every 2 months for 8 to 10 months. After recovery, 105 patients (61%) (30 male, 75 female) reported one or more COVID-19 persistent symptoms. Fatigue, dyspnea, and depression were the most common persistent symptoms representing 37.3%, 22%, 22%, respectively. We found that age was independently related to the persistence of symptoms. During the follow-up, six females (3.5%) had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 re-infection. Their mean age was 35.7 ± 11 years. The mean interval from the complete recovery of the first infection to the onset of the second one was 53 ± 22.2 days and ranged from 30 to 90 days. The second infection was milder in severity than the first infection in 83.33% of cases. There was a high percentage of patients who complained of persistent symptoms after recovery from COVID-19. Fatigue and headache were the most common persistent symptoms. Age was considered a risk factor for persistent symptoms.

Medical students, as frontline healthcare workers, are more susceptible to be infected by the virus. The aim of this study was to assess COVID-19 related knowledge, self-reported preventive behaviors and risk perception among Iranian medical students within the first week after the onset of the outbreak in Iran. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from 26th to 28th of February, 2020. Participants were Iranian medical students (5th-7th year) whose knowledge, preventive behaviors and risk perceptions of COVID-19 were assessed using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of 26 questions including 15 items about COVID-19 related knowledge, 9 items regarding preventive measures and 2 items about COVID-19 risk perception. The validity and reliability of the questionnaire were shown to be satisfactory. RESULTS: A total of 240 medical students completed the questionnaire. The mean age of participants was 23.67 years. The average of correct answers of knowledge was 86.96%; and 79.60% had high level of related knowledge. The average rate of practicing preventive behaviors was 94.47%; and 94.2% had high level of performance in preventive behaviors. The cumulative score of risk perception was 4.08 out of 8 which was in moderate range. Risk perception was significantly different between stagers and interns and between those being trained in emergency room (ER) and non-ER wards. There was a significant negative correlation between preventive behaviors and risk perception.

OBJECTIVE: We examine the use of a nature and art-related activity retreat designed for researchers. The purpose was to evaluate if and how researchers perceived different workshop experiences set in nature as meaningful and important with regards to their self-care. METHODS: A mixed group of six researchers from Sweden, Finland, and the United States met for a three-day retreat consisting of self-selected nature and art-related activities. From data constituted from participant reflections, a focus group interview, a three months follow-up questionnaire, and an analysis of the workshops undertaken, three major themes were identified: ""Sharing and connection"", ""Embodiment"" and ""Nature"". RESULTS: Analysis of the workshop-style exercises did not show significant variance in reported meaningfulness and usefulness related to the activity itself. However, there was a strong correlation between perceived value and shared experience where the sharing of the natural space was felt to put humanity into perspective. CONCLUSION: Organizing and systematizing health preventive retreats for researchers in academia may be an important part of the sustainabile academic community in which the researcher needs to be better taken care of in a more embodied way. Although this study was conducted prior to COVID-19, such retreats and potentially also online versions, could be useful for managing the pandemic and afterwards, in our new ""normal"".","Bojner Horwitz, Eva; Spännäri, Jenni; Langley, Julia; Jacobs, Bette; Osika, Walter",Work,,110
444028,Dancing with death. A historical perspective on coping with Covid-19,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To assess population-based prevalence, risk factors, hospitalization, and infection fatality rates (IFR) associated with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted two household surveys among the non-institutionalized adult population from May 30 to June 17, 2020, in Lajeado, an 84,000-inhabitant industrial city in southern Brazil. Primary outcome was prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Secondary outcomes were COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths occurring up to June 20, 2020. We summarized prevalence rates across surveys with meta-analysis. We assessed age-range IFR and hospitalization rate and regressed these rates over age strata using nonlinear (exponential) coefficients of determination (R2). RESULTS: Summarized overall prevalence was 3.40% (95% CI, 2.74-4.18), 34% lower in older adults &#8805;60 years. Prevalence was 14.3 and 5.4 times higher among household contacts and meat-precessing plant (MPP) workers, respectively. IFR ranged from 0.08% (0.06-0.11) to 4.63% (2.93-7.84) in individuals 20-39 years and &#8805;60 years, respectively. R2 for hospitalization rate and IFR over age were 0.98 and 0.93 (both p-values <0.0001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first population-based study in Brazil to estimate COVID-19 prevalence, hospitalization, and fatality rates per age stratum. Rates were largely age-dependent. Household contacts and MPP workers are at higher risk of infection.

The aim of this registry-based observational study was to explore characteristics and clinical outcomes of recipients of kidney transplants included in the French nationwide Registry of Solid Organ Transplant Recipients with Covid-19. Covid-19 was diagnosed in symptomatic patients who had a positive PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 or having typical lung lesions on imaging. Clinical and laboratory characteristics, management of immunosuppression, treatment for Covid-19, and clinical outcomes (hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or death) were recorded. Risk factors for severe disease or death were determined. Of the 279 patients, 243 were admitted to hospital and 36 were managed at home. The median age of hospitalized patients was 61.6 years; most had comorbidities (hypertension, 90.1%; overweight, 63.8%; diabetes, 41.3%; cardiovascular disease, 36.2%). Fever, cough, dyspnea, and diarrhea were the most common symptoms on admission. Laboratory findings revealed mild inflammation frequently accompanied by lymphopenia. Immunosuppressive drugs were generally withdrawn (calcineurin inhibitors: 28.7%; antimetabolites: 70.8%). Treatment was mainly based on hydroxychloroquine (24.7%), antiviral drugs (7.8%), and tocilizumab (5.3%). Severe Covid-19 occurred in 106 patients (46%). Forty-three hospitalized patients died (30-day mortality 22.8%). Multivariable analysis identified overweight, fever, and dyspnea as independent risk factors for severe disease, whereas age over 60 years, cardiovascular disease, and dyspnea were independently associated with mortality. Thus, Covid-19 in recipients of kidney transplants portends a high mortality rate. Proper management of immunosuppression and tailored treatment of this population remain challenging.","Caillard, Sophie; Anglicheau, Dany; Matignon, Marie; Durrbach, Antoine; Greze, Clarisse; Frimat, Luc; Thaunat, Olivier; Legris, Tristan; Moal, Valerie; Westeel, Pierre Francois; Kamar, Nassim; Gatault, Philippe; Snanoudj, Renaud; Sicard, Antoine; Bertrand, Dominique; Colosio, Charlotte; Couzi, Lionel; Chemouny, Jonathan M; Masset, Christophe; Blancho, Gilles; Bamoulid, Jamal; Duveau, Agnes; Bouvier, Nicolas; Chavarot, Nathalie; Grimbert, Philippe; Moulin, Bruno; Le Meur, Yannick; Hazzan, Marc",Kidney int,,110

Objective: In this cohort study, we aimed to report the disease characteristics and variables associated with COVID-19 outcome among Turkish patients with IRDs. Methods: Between April and June, 2020, 167 adult IRD patients with COVID-19 were registered from 31 centers in 14 cities in Turkey. Disease outcome was classified in 4 categories; (i) outpatient management, (ii) hospitalization without oxygen requirement, (iii) hospitalization with oxygen requirement, and (iv) intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine variables associated with a worse outcome. Results: 165 patients (mean age: 50 ± 15.6 years, 58.2% female) were included. Twenty-four patients (14.5%) recovered under outpatient management, 141 (85.5%) were hospitalized, 49 (30%) required inpatient oxygen support, 22 (13%) were treated in the ICU (17 received invasive mechanic ventilation) and 16 (10%) died. Glucocorticoid use (OR: 4.53, 95%CI 1.65-12.76), chronic kidney disease (OR: 12.8, 95%CI 2.25-103.5), pulmonary disease (OR: 2.66, 95%CI 1.08-6.61) and obesity (OR: 3.7, 95%CI 1.01-13.87) were associated with a worse outcome. Biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) do not seem to affect COVID-19 outcome while conventional synthetic DMARDs may have a protective effect (OR: 0.36, 95%CI 0.17-0.75). Estimates for the associations between IRD diagnoses and outcome were inconclusive. Conclusions: Among IRD patients with COVID-19, comorbidities and glucocorticoid use were associated with a worse outcome, while biologic DMARDs do not seem to be associated with a worse outcome.","Esatoglu, Sinem Nihal; Tascilar, Koray; Babaoglu, Hakan; Bes, Cemal; Yurttas, Berna; Akar, Servet; Pehlivan, Ozlem; Akleylek, Cansu; Tecer, Duygu; Seyahi, Emire; Yuce-Inel, Tuba; Alpay-Kanitez, Nilufer; Bodakci, Erdal; Tekgoz, Emre; Colak, Seda; Bolek, Ertugrul Cagri; Koca, Suleyman Serdar; Kalyoncu, Umut; Icacan, Ozan Cemal; Ugurlu, Serdal; Oz, Hande Ece; Hamuryudan, Vedat; Hatemi, Gulen",Front Immunol,,110

Computed tomography (CT) has been widely used in the diagnosis of this novel pneumonia. This study aims to understand the role of CT for the diagnosis and the main imaging manifestations of patients with COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a rapid review and meta-analysis on studies about the use of chest CT for the diagnosis of COVID-19. We comprehensively searched databases and preprint servers on chest CT for patients with COVID-19 between 1 January 2020 and 31 March 2020. The primary outcome was the sensitivity of chest CT imaging. We also conducted subgroup analyses and evaluated the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results: A total of 103 studies with 5,673 patients were included. Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results as reference, a meta-analysis based on 64 studies estimated the sensitivity of chest CT imaging in COVID-19 was 99% (95% CI, 0.97-1.00). If case reports were excluded, the sensitivity in case series was 96% (95% CI, 0.93-0.99). The sensitivity of CT scan in confirmed patients under 18 years old was only 66% (95% CI, 0.15-1.00). The most common imaging manifestation was ground-glass opacities (GGO) which was found in 75% (95% CI, 0.68-0.82) of the patients. The pooled probability of bilateral involvement was 84% (95% CI, 0.81-0.88). The most commonly involved lobes were the right lower lobe (84%, 95% CI, 0.78-0.90) and left lower lobe (81%, 95% CI, 0.74-0.87). The quality of evidence was low across all outcomes. Conclusions: In conclusion, this meta-analysis indicated that chest CT scan had a high sensitivity in diagnosis of patients with COVID-19. Therefore, CT can potentially be used to assist in the diagnosis of COVID-19.","Lv, Meng; Wang, Mengshu; Yang, Nan; Luo, Xufei; Li, Wei; Chen, Xin; Liu, Yunlan; Ren, Mengjuan; Zhang, Xianzhuo; Wang, Ling; Ma, Yanfang; Lei, Junqiang; Fukuoka, Toshio; Ahn, Hyeong Sik; Lee, Myeong Soo; Luo, Zhengxiu; Chen, Yaolong; Liu, Enmei; Tian, Jinhui; Wang, Xiaohui",Ann.

Due to the significant dispersion of PCDP in the dental environment, the use of equipment such as ultrasonic tips have been inadvisable during the pandemic. Several clinical procedures, however, benefit from the use of such equipment. Thus, using a microbial dispersion model of PCDP, the aim of this study was to compare the dispersion caused by the dental drill (DD) an ultrasonic tip (UT) alone and the UT coupled with a Spray control (SC) device. The DD, UT (with or without the SC) were activated for one minute having had the water from the reservoir replaced with a suspension of Lactobacillus casei Shirota (1.5 x 108 CFU/mL). Petri dishes containing MRS agar were positioned at 50cm, 100cm and 150cm from the headrest of the dental chair at different angles (0 degree and 90 degrees). At 50 cm, the mean CFU (standard deviation) of L. casei Shirota was 13554.60 (4071.03) for the DD, 286.67 (73.99) for the US (97.89% reduction), and 4.5 (0.58) CFU for the UT-SC (p < 0.0001), establishing a further 98.43% reduction between UT and UT with SC. The UT with SC model proved effective in reducing dispersion from the UT, endorsing its use as an additional strategy to reduce PCDP in the dental environment in times of pandemic.","Montalli, Victor Angelo Martins; Garcez, Aguinaldo Silva; de Oliveira, Laís Viana Canuto; Sperandio, Marcelo; Napimoga, Marcelo Henrique; Motta, Rogério Heládio Lopes",PLoS One,,110

This paper's focus is on the spatial aspect of its spread, with the aims being to point to spatial conditioning underpinning development of the pandemic, and to identify and assess possible socio-economic features exerting an impact on that. Particular attention has been paid to the percentage of positive tests for the presence of the coronavirus, as well as mortality due to the disease it causes. The statistics used relate to 102 countries, with the research for each extending from the time first cases of COVID-19 were reported through to 18 November 2020. The focus of investigation has been the stochastic co-occurrence of both a morbidity index and a mortality index, with intentionally selected socio-economic variables. Results have then been summarized through the classification of countries in relation to the two indices. Highest values relate to Latin America. A significant co-occurrence of morbidity and mortality with GDP per capita has been identified, as values for the indices are found to be lower in wealthier countries. The basic conclusion is that the dependency of the pandemic on environmental and socio-economic conditioning became more complex and ambiguous, while also being displaced gradually as concrete political decisions came to be taken.","Banski, Jerzy; Mazur, Marcin; Kaminska, Wioletta",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,110
450238,Adaptations and well-being: Gulf of Alaska fishing families in a changing landscape,2020,"PURPOSE: To investigate foveal morphologic parameters related to visual acuity and the stages classified in this study reflect the severity of the macular pseudohole (MPH). METHODS: Seventy-eight eyes of 78 consecutive patients diagnosed with MPH were studied. Quantitative optical coherence tomography (OCT) parameters including central foveal thickness, parafoveal thickness, parafoveal inner and outer retinal thickness (PIRT and PORT), pseudohole depth, pseudohole diameter, and inner nuclear layer (INL) angulation were measured and the morphologic features of the inner retina (disorganization of retinal inner layers (DRIL)) and the photoreceptor layer (external limiting membrane (ELM), ellipsoid zone (EZ), interdigitation zone (IZ), and cotton ball sign) were determined. Associations between OCT parameters and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were analyzed. Based on the location of the inner margin of INL, all patients were divided into three stages and the mean comparison between the three stages was analyzed. RESULTS: PIRT (r = 0.6489; p < 0.0001) and pseudohole depth (r = 0.5266; p < 0.0001) had a statistically significant correlation with BCVA. Statistically significant visual acuity differences were found in eyes with DRIL (p < 0.001) and IZ disruption (p = 0.018), but not in ELM disruption (p = 0.916), EZ disruption (p = 0.581), and cotton ball sign (p = 0.075). According to the univariate and multivariate regression analyses, PIRT was associated with BCVA in both univariate (p < 0.001) and multivariate (p = 0.002) regression analyses. Defect diameters of both ELM (p = 0.025) and IZ (p = 0.006) were associated with BCVA in univariate regression analysis, but not in multivariate regression analysis. INL angulation and the ratio of the IZ disruption was significantly different in the three groups. Stage 3 (95.8%) had significantly higher disrupted IZ ratio than stage 1 (40%) and stage 2 (65.5%). The BCVA of stages 1, 2, and 3 were identified as 0.06 ± 0.07 (20/23 Snellen equivalent), 0.23 ± 0.17 (20/34 Snellen equivalent), and 0.48 ± 0.23 (20/60 Snellen equivalent), respectively, and the differences in BCVA between the three groups were significant (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The parameters related to visual acuity were PIRT, pseudohole depth, DRIL, and IZ. The stage classification proposed in this study included morphologic changes of the inner retina and photoreceptor layer and is likely to be clinically useful for showing the severity of the MPH.","Ku, Hee Chan; Cho, Eun Hyung; Han, Jeong Mo; Lee, Eun Koo; Park, Young-Hoon",Graefes arch. clin. exp. ophthalmol,,110

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Time data of requests for patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lung disease were analyzed between February 27th and May 27th 2020. A multinomial logistic regression model was used to evaluate differences in the number of requests between 3 time intervals (I1: 6am - 2pm, I2: 2pm - 10pm, I3: 10pm - 6am). A cosinor model was applied to investigate the demand per hour. Requests per day were compared to the number of regional COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: 551 COVID-19 related chest imagings (32.8% outpatients, 67.2% in-patients) of 243 patients were conducted (33.3% female, 66.7% male, mean age 60 ± 17 years). Most exams for outpatients were required during I2 (I1 vs. I2: odds ratio (OR) = 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62-0.86, p = 0.01; I2 vs. I3: OR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.04-1.48, p = 0.03) with an acrophase at 7:29 pm. Requests for in-patients decreased from I1 to I3 (I1 vs. I2: OR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.09-1.41, p = 0.01; I2 vs. I3: OR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.05-1.28, p = 0.01) with an acrophase at 12:51 pm. The number of requests per day for outpatients developed similarly to regional cases while demand for in-patients increased later and persisted longer. CONCLUSIONS: The demand for COVID-19 related chest imaging displayed distinct distribution patterns depending on the sector of patient care and point of time during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. These patterns should be considered in the allocation of resources in future pandemic challenges with similar disease characteristics.","Koehler, Daniel; Ozga, Ann-Kathrin; Molwitz, Isabel; May, Philipp; Görich, Hanna Maria; Keller, Sarah; Adam, Gerhard; Yamamura, Jin",PLoS One,,110

METHODS: Fifteen Covid-19 and 93 non-Covid-19 patients were included in RNA testing. All epidemiological and clinical data were collected and analyzed, and then comparative results were carried out. RESULTS: Covid-19 patients were older (46.40 ± 18.21 years vs 34.43 ± 18.80 years) and had a higher body weight (70.27 ± 10.67 kg vs 60.54 ± 12.33 kg, P < 0.05). The main symptoms that were similar between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients, and Covid-19 patients showed a lower incidence of sputum production (6.67% vs 45.16%, P < 0.01) and a lower white-cell count (4.83 × 109/L vs 7.43 × 109/L) and lymphocyte count (0.90 × 109/L vs 1.57 × 109/L, P < 0.01). Although there were no differences, C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 were elevated in Covid-19 patients. The sensitivity and negative predictive value of CT images were 0.87 and 0.97, respectively. Covid-19 patients showed a higher contact history of Wuhan residents (80% vs 30.11%) and higher familial clustering (53.33% vs 8.60%, P < 0.001). Covid-19 patients showed a higher major adverse events (ARDS, 13.33%; death, 6.67%; P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that Covid-19patients had a significant history of exposure and familial clustering and a higher rate of severe status; biochemical indicators showed lymphocyte depletion.","Li, Yanzi; Li, Hongxia; Han, Jianfeng; Yang, Lin",BMC Infect Dis,,110

451618,Analysis of teaching experience in Physical Education classes during COVID-19 confinement in Mexico,2021,"Optimizing economic and public policy is critical to address socioeconomic issues and trade-offs, e.g., improving equality, productivity, or wellness, and poses a complex mechanism design problem. A policy designer needs to consider multiple objectives, policy levers, and behavioral responses from strategic actors who optimize for their individual objectives. Moreover, real-world policies should be explainable and robust to simulation-to-reality gaps, e.g., due to calibration issues. Existing approaches are often limited to a narrow set of policy levers or objectives that are hard to measure, do not yield explicit optimal policies, or do not consider strategic behavior, for example. Hence, it remains challenging to optimize policy in real-world scenarios. Here we show that the AI Economist framework enables effective, flexible, and interpretable policy design using two-level reinforcement learning (RL) and data-driven simulations. We validate our framework on optimizing the stringency of US state policies and Federal subsidies during a pandemic, e.g., COVID-19, using a simulation fitted to real data. We find that log-linear policies trained using RL significantly improve social welfare, based on both public health and economic outcomes, compared to past outcomes. Their behavior can be explained, e.g., well-performing policies respond strongly to changes in recovery and vaccination rates. They are also robust to calibration errors, e.g., infection rates that are over or underestimated. As of yet, real-world policymaking has not seen adoption of machine learning methods at large, including RL and AI-driven simulations. Our results show the potential of AI to guide policy design and improve social welfare amidst the complexity of the real world.","Trott, Alexander; Srinivasa, Sunil; Wal, Douwe van der; Haneuse, Sebastien; Zheng, Stephan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.02904v1.pdf,110

By reviewing a large body of related literature and conducting a fine grained analysis based on sex-disaggregated data of 61 countries spanning 5 continents, we discover several confounding factors that could possibly explain the supposed male vulnerability to COVID-19. We thus highlight the challenge of making causal claims based on available data, given the lack of statistical significance and potential existence of biases. Informed by our findings on potential variables acting as confounders, we contribute a broad overview on the issues bias, explainability and fairness entail in data-driven analyses. Thus, we outline a set of discriminatory policy consequences that could, based on such results, lead to unintended discrimination. To raise awareness on the dimensionality of such foreseen impacts, we have compiled an encyclopedia-like reference guide, the Bias Catalog for Pandemics (BCP), to provide definitions and emphasize realistic examples of bias in general, and within the COVID-19 pandemic context. These are categorized within a division of bias families and a 2-level priority scale, together with preventive steps. In addition, we facilitate the Bias Priority Recommendations on how to best use and apply this catalog, and provide guidelines in order to address real world research questions. The objective is to anticipate and avoid disparate impact and discrimination, by considering causality, explainability, bias and techniques to mitigate the latter. With these, we hope to 1) contribute to designing and conducting fair and equitable data-driven studies and research; and 2) interpret and draw meaningful and actionable conclusions from these.","D'iaz-Rodr'iguez, Natalia; Binkyt.e-Sadauskien.e, Ruta; Bakkali, Wafae; Bookseller, Sannidhi; Tubaro, Paola; Bacevicius, Andrius; Chatila, Raja",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14492v1.pdf,110

Markers of monocyte activation and expression of adherence and chemokine receptors indicative of altered migratory capacity were also higher at 1-3 months post-infection in individuals who had mild SARS-CoV-2, but these were no longer elevated by 6-9 months post-infection. Perhaps most surprisingly, polyclonal activation of T cells was higher in individuals who had recently experienced a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to individuals with other recent respiratory infections.

We sought to characterize and compare grandparent- and parent-headed households with respect to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), child temperament, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and caregiver aggravation and coping. METHODS: Using a combined data set of children ages 3 to 17 from the 2016, 2017, and 2018 National Survey of Children's Health, we applied survey regression procedures, adjusted for sociodemographic confounders, to compare grandparent- and parent-headed households on composite and single-item outcome measures of ACEs; ADHD; preschool inattention and restlessness; child temperament; and caregiver aggravation, coping, support, and interactions with children. RESULTS: Among 80 646 households (2407 grandparent-headed, 78 239 parent-headed), children in grandparent-headed households experienced more ACEs (ß = 1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07 to 1.38). Preschool-aged and school-aged children in grandparent-headed households were more likely to have ADHD (adjusted odds ratio = 4.29, 95% CI: 2.22 to 8.28; adjusted odds ratio = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.34 to 2.20). School-aged children in these households had poorer temperament (ßadj = .25, 95% CI: -0.63 to 1.14), and their caregivers experienced greater aggravation (ßadj = .29, 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.49). However, these differences were not detected after excluding children with ADHD from the sample. No differences were noted between grandparent- and parent-headed households for caregiver coping, emotional support, or interactions with children. CONCLUSIONS: Despite caring for children with greater developmental problems and poorer temperaments, grandparent caregivers seem to cope with parenting about as well as parents.","Rapoport, Eli; Muthiah, Nallammai; Keim, Sarah A; Adesman, Andrew",Pediatrics,,110

458281,Data-driven modeling reveals a universal dynamic underlying the COVID-19 pandemic under social distancing,2020-04-21,"Pulmonary melioidosis is a bacterial disease with high morbidity and a mortality rate that can be as high as 40% in resource-poor regions of South Asia. This disease burden is linked to the pathogen's intrinsic antibiotic-resistance and protected intracellular localization in alveolar macrophages. Current treatment regimens require several antibiotics with multi-month oral and intravenous administrations that are difficult to implement in the developing world. Herein, we report that a macrophage-targeted polyciprofloxacin prodrug acts as a surprisingly effective pre-exposure prophylactic in highly lethal murine models of aerosolized human pulmonary melioidosis. A single dose of the polymeric prodrug maintained high lung drug levels and targeted an intracellular depot of ciprofloxacin to the alveolar macrophage compartment that was sustained over a period of 7â¯days above minimal inhibitory concentrations. This intracellular pharmacokinetic profile provided complete pre-exposure protection in a BSL-3 model with a drug-resistant, aerosolized clinical isolate of Burkholderia pseudomallei from Thailand. This total protection was achieved despite the bacteria's intrinsic resistance to ciprofloxacin and where an equivalent dose of pulmonary-administered ciprofloxacin was ineffective. For the first time, we demonstrate that targeting the intracellular macrophage compartment with extended antibiotic dosing can achieve pre-exposure prophylaxis in a model of pulmonary melioidosis. This fully synthetic and modular therapeutic platform could be an important therapeutic approach with new or re-purposed antibiotics for melioidosis prevention and treatment, especially as portable inhalation devices in high-risk, resource-poor settings.","Chavas, Thomas E J; Su, Fang-Yi; Srinivasan, Selvi; Roy, Debashish; Lee, Brian; Lovelace-Macon, Lara; Rerolle, Guilhem F; Limqueco, Elaine; Skerrett, Shawn J; Ratner, Daniel M; West, Timothy Eoin; Stayton, Patrick S",J Control Release,,110

Methods: The search was conducted using the Cochrane, PUBMED, EMBASE, and LILACS databases, as well as grey literature, using Opengrey. A search was also conducted using references from primary and secondary studies that were found. No language or time period restrictions were applied. All papers that objective was to check efficacy and safety of the use of cloth face masks as protection against viral transmission were included, as well as laboratory studies assessing barriers against particles. We excluded studies approaching the use of face masks by healthcare providers. Two independent reviewers selected the studies, and discrepancies were decided by a third reviewer. Results: No randomized clinical trials involving cloth face masks for the general population were found. Seven studies assessing different types of cloth to prevent the penetration of droplets at a laboratory level and a review study were included. Conclusion: Using cloth face masks provides a barrier against droplets when compared with not using any face masks. The face mask is an additional preventive mesuare and must be used along with respiratory etiquette hand hygiene social distancing and isolation of cases.","Taminato, Monica; Mizusaki-Imoto, Aline; Saconato, Humberto; Franco, Eduardo Signorini Bicas; Puga, Maria Eduarda; Duarte, Márcio Luís; Peccin, Maria Stella",Acta Paul.

This study assesses the general mental health and immediate psychological impacts in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Method: In this cross-sectional study, 88 patients from two tertiary hospitals in Tehran agreed to complete the surveys. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and 12 item General Health questionnaire (GHQ-12) were used to evaluate mental health and impact of disease. Epidemiological and sociodemographic information entailing underlying diseases was assess by a researcher-made questionnaire. Results: We found that the psychological impact of the current pandemic is mild to moderate. During the initial phase of the pandemic, the intellectual engagements, inducing post event stress is not yet entirely developed. However, patients had a moderate to high probability of psychiatric morbidity with 63.6% and 28.4%, respectively. Conclusion: The effect of such viral pandemic on mental health is inevitable. As we conducted the study in the dire times of the outbreak, patients showed a high probability of psychiatric morbidity. On the other hand, since the study was done in the initial phase of the epidemic, we detected mild effects of the epidemic on PTSD in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, several psychosocial protective programs should be implicated to address the mental complications.

466181,COVID-19 pandemic: Students' perspectives on dental geriatric care and education,2020,"We construct a novel database containing hundreds of thousands geotagged messages related to the COVID-19 pandemic sent on Twitter. We create a daily index of social distancing-at the state level-to capture social distancing beliefs by analyzing the number of tweets containing keywords such as ""stay home"", ""stay safe"", ""wear mask"", ""wash hands"" and ""social distancing"". We find that an increase in the Twitter index of social distancing on day t-1 is associated with a decrease in mobility on day t. We also find that state orders, an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, precipitation and temperature contribute to reducing human mobility. Republican states are also less likely to enforce social distancing. Beliefs shared on social networks could both reveal the behavior of individuals and influence the behavior of others. Our findings suggest that policy makers can use geotagged Twitter data-in conjunction with mobility data-to better understand individual voluntary social distancing actions.","Porcher, Simon; Renault, Thomas",PLoS One,,110

Although remdesivir has recently been approved by the FDA to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, no oral antiviral is available for outpatient treatment. AT-527, an orally administered double prodrug of a guanosine nucleotide analog, was previously shown to be highly efficacious and well tolerated in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected subjects. Here, we report the potent in vitro activity of AT-511, the free base of AT-527, against several coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. In normal human airway epithelial cells, the concentration of AT-511 required to inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 by 90% (EC90) was 0.47 µM, very similar to its EC90 against human coronavirus (HCoV)-229E, HCoV-OC43, and SARS-CoV in Huh-7 cells. Little to no cytotoxicity was observed for AT-511 at concentrations up to 100 µM. Substantial levels of the active triphosphate metabolite AT-9010 were formed in normal human bronchial and nasal epithelial cells incubated with 10 µM AT-511 (698 ± 15 and 236 ± 14 µM, respectively), with a half-life of at least 38 h. Results from steady-state pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution studies of nonhuman primates administered oral doses of AT-527, as well as pharmacokinetic data from subjects given daily oral doses of AT-527, predict that twice daily oral doses of 550 mg AT-527 will produce AT-9010 trough concentrations in human lung that exceed the EC90 observed for the prodrug against SARS-CoV-2 replication. This suggests that AT-527 may be an effective treatment option for COVID-19.","Good, Steven S; Westover, Jonna; Jung, Kie Hoon; Zhou, Xiao-Jian; Moussa, Adel; La Colla, Paolo; Collu, Gabriella; Canard, Bruno; Sommadossi, Jean-Pierre",,,110

468978,The Impact of Transitions Related to COVID-19 on Pharmacy Student Well-being,2021,"Since the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, numerous forecasting models have been proposed to project the trajectory of coronavirus infection cases. We propose a new discrete-time Markov chain transition matrix model that directly incorporates stochastic behavior and for which parameter estimation is straightforward from available data. Using such data from China's Hubei province (for which Wuhan is the provincial capital city), the model is shown to be flexible, robust, and accurate. As a result, it has been adopted by the first Shanghai assistance medical team in Wuhan's Jinyintan Hospital, which was the first designated hospital to take COVID-19 patients in the world. The forecast has been used for preparing medical staff, intensive care unit (ICU) beds, ventilators, and other critical care medical resources and for supporting real-time medical management decisions. Empirical data from China's first two months (January/February) of fighting COVID-19 was collected and used to enhance the model by embedding NPI efficiency into the model. We applied the model to forecast Italy, South Korea, and Iran on March 9. Later we made forecasts for Spain, Germany, France, US on March 24. Again, the model has performed very well, proven to be flexible, robust, and accurate for most of these countries/regions outside China.","Chen, Jian; Fu, Michael C.; Zhang, Wenhong; Zheng, Junhua",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.01201v1.pdf,110

Kidney transplant (KT) recipients are one of the vulnerable populations for infection. COVID-19 infection in KT recipients might be a complicated and awkward situation, but there has been a lack of reports concerning this group. Herein, we demonstrated two distinct cases with different clinical progress. The first case was a 36-year-old man who underwent KT 3 years ago. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 expressing relevant symptoms. Following administration of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine with reduced immunosuppressant, he recovered from COVID-19. However, the unexpected fluctuations in tacrolimus trough levels needed to be managed because of drug-to-drug interaction. The second case was developed in a 56-year-old man without any symptoms. He received a second KT from an ABO-incompatible donor 8 years ago. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 by screening due to exposure history. During the hospitalization period, the chest infiltrative lesion showed a wax and wane, but he successfully recovered by administration of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin. These apparently different cases suggest that assertive screening and management could improve the clinical course. In addition, antiviral agents should be used cautiously, especially in patients on calcineurin inhibitors.","Kim, Yaerim; Kwon, Ohyun; Paek, Jin H; Park, Woo Y; Jin, Kyubok; Hyun, Miri; Lee, Ji Y; Kim, Hyun A; Han, Seungyeup",Am J Transplant,,110

This Editorial highlights a study by Aliu and colleagues in the current issue of the Journal of Neurochemistry, in which the investigators constructed a biodegradable poly-l-lysine backbone with multiple copies of this sulfated HNK-1 trisaccharide. This decoy, poly(phenyl disodium 3-O-sulfo-ß-d-glucopyranuronate)-(1â3)-ß-d-galactopyranoside, known as PPSGG, removed anti-MAG IgM autoantibodies from the blood, while not activating the immune system. These findings provide a path for the selective removal of a pathogenic set of antibodies that target the myelin sheath resulting in neuropathy. These findings are applicable to a parallel strategy for the generation of polysaccharides similar to those present in the receptor-binding domain of CoViD-19, which might inhibit viral adhesion to its receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) protein, thereby impairing cellular uptake of the virus itself. The deployment of complex polysaccharides that mimic actual COVID19 polysaccharides on the spike protein may also provide a feasible structural basis for a vaccine. Carbohydrate mimics, if conjugated to a carrier or backbone, might provoke an immune response to the spike protein. A vaccine that targets critical carbohydrates on COVID19, and then neutralizes the virus would recapitulate a successful strategy employed in other microbial vaccines, like the pneumococcal vaccines and the meningococcal vaccines. These vaccines direct an immune response to complex carbohydrates and successfully prevent life-threatening disease. This paper provides lessons from a rare neurologic disease that may teach us strategies applicable to a global pandemic.","Steinman, Lawrence",J. neurochem,,110

The aim of this study was to analyze risk factors for COVID-19 prevalence and deaths in all 6 geopolitical regions and 37 States in Nigeria. Methods: we analyzed the data retrieved from various sources, including Nigeria CDC, Nigeria National Bureau of Statistics, Unicef-Nigeria multiple indicator cluster survey and the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington. We examined 4 clinical risk factors (prevalence of TB, HIV, smoking and BCG vaccination coverage) and 5 sociodemographic factors (age &#8805;65, population density, literacy rate, unemployment and GDP per capita). Multivariate modeling was conducted using generalized linear model. Results: our analysis showed that the incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases differed widely across the 37 States, from 0.09 per 100,000 in Kogi to 83.7 in Lagos. However, more than 70% of confirmed cases were concentrated in just 7 States: Lagos, Abuja, Oyo, Kano, Edo, Rivers and Delta. Case mortality rate (CMR) also varied considerably, with Lagos, Abuja and Edo having CMR above 9 per million population. On bivariate analysis, higher CMR correlated positively with GDP (r=0.53) and to a lesser extent with TB (r=0.36) and population density (r=0.38). On multivariate analysis, which is more definitive, States with higher HIV prevalence and BCG coverage had lower CMR, while high GDP States had a greater CMR. Conclusion: this study indicates that COVID-19 has disproportionately affected certain States in Nigeria. Population susceptibility factors include higher economic development but not literacy or unemployment. Death rates were mildly lower in States with higher HIV prevalence and BCG vaccination coverage.","Hassan, Zubaida; Hashim, Muhammad Jawad; Khan, Gulfaraz",Pan Afr Med J,,110

COVID-19 served as the catalyst to accelerate telehealth efforts. IMPLEMENTATION: COVID-19 resulted in the need for patient care with ""social distancing."" In addition, due to the pandemic, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and other insurers began expanded reimbursement for telehealth. More than 2000 providers received virtual health training in less than 2 weeks. In March 2020, we provided 2376 virtual visits, and in April 5293, which was more than 75 times the number provided in February; 73% of all visits in April were virtual (up from 0.5% in October 2019). As COVID-19 cases receded in May, June, and July, patient demand for virtual visits decreased, but 28% of visits in July were still virtual. LESSONS LEARNED: Several key lessons are important for future efforts regarding clinical implementation: (1) prepare for innovation, (2) cultivate an innovation mindset, (3) standardize (but not too much), (4) technological innovation is necessary but not sufficient, and (5) communicate widely and often.","Knierim, Kyle; Palmer, Christina; Kramer, Erik Seth; Rodriguez, Rachel S; VanWyk, Jill; Shmerling, Alison; Smith, Peter; Holmstrom, Heather; Bacak, Brian S; Brown Levey, Shandra M; Staton, Elizabeth W; Holtrop, Jodi Summers",J Am Board Fam Med,,110

Panic buying is one of the erratic phenomenon that has been observed in many countries of the world during this COVID-19 pandemic. The selling of online sex dolls, lingerie, and sex toys was increased during the COVID-19 lockdown in several countries like Australia, UK, Denmark, Colombia, New Zealand, Italy, Spain, France, India, North America, and Ireland. The increase in sex toy market turnover has several implications such as customization of recreational facilities, limitations in alternative sources of pleasure, need to have sex and unfortunately, and unavailability of a partner. We speculate that people may buy sex toys in response to perceived scarcity, perceived short supply, the anticipation of price hike, or to get control over the environment. However, there could be other factors such as an extra time to explore sexuality, and being apart from the partners. There is a need to study the sexual behavior and sex toy use among people in the post-pandemic era and their repercussions on the intimate relationship.","Arafat, S. M.

Its role in augmenting thrombotic microangiopathy mediated organ damage has also been implicated in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to examine associations between complement parameters and progression to severe COVID-19 illness, as well as correlations with other systems. Blood samples of COVID-19 patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) were analyzed for a wide panel of complement and inflammatory biomarkers. The primary outcome was COVID-19 severity at index ED visit, while the secondary outcome was peak disease severity over the course of illness. Fifty-two COVID-19 patients were enrolled. C3a (p = 0.018), C3a/C3 ratio (p = 0.002), and sC5b-9/C3 ratio (p = 0.021) were significantly elevated in with severe disease at ED presentation. Over the course of illness, C3a (p = 0.028) and C3a/C3 ratio (p = 0.003) were highest in the moderate severity group. In multivariate regression controlled for confounders, complement hyperactivation failed to predict progression to severe disease. C3a, C3a/C3 ratio, and sC5b-9/C3 ratio were correlated positively with numerous inflammatory biomarkers, fibrinogen, and VWF:Ag, and negatively with plasminogen and ADAMTS13 activity. We found evidence of complement hyperactivation in COVID-19, associated with hyperinflammation and thrombotic microangiopathy. Complement inhibition should be further investigated for potential benefit in patients displaying a hyperinflammatory and microangiopathic phenotype.","Henry, Brandon Michael; Szergyuk, Ivan; de Oliveira, Maria Helena Santos; Lippi, Giuseppe; Benoit, Justin L; Vikse, Jens; Benoit, Stefanie W",J Med Virol,,110
479728,Moral Decision-Making and Support for Safety Procedures Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Amidst the coronavirus pandemic, universities across the country abruptly closed campuses and transitioned to remote learning. The effects of these unprecedented closures are unknown. The current study examined reported alcohol consumption during the week prior to and after campus closure at a public university in Northeast Ohio. Analysis of data from 1,958 students, who endorsed using alcohol in the past 30 days, demonstrates that alcohol consumption (amount and frequency) increased as time progressed. Those with more symptoms of depression and anxiety reported greater increases in alcohol consumption (assessed via retrospective timeline follow-back) compared to students with fewer symptoms. Furthermore, students with greater perceived social support reported less alcohol consumption. Together, these findings highlight the need for universities to offer services and programs to students that will minimize risk factors and maximize protective factors in order to reduce or prevent alcohol abuse during the coronavirus pandemic.","Lechner, William V; Laurene, Kimberly R; Patel, Sweta; Anderson, Megan; Grega, Chelsea; Kenne, Deric R",Addict Behav,,110

In this review, the authors reveal practical aspects that are important during the COVID-19 pandemic with regards to the safe delivery of cardiac anesthesia. Timing for operations of the cardio-vascular system may be well programmed in most cases. Hence, the level of priorities must be defined for any single patient. The postponement of surgery may be convenient for most cases, if it is made in the best interest of the patient. The preanesthetic evaluation should be attentive of the respiratory history of the patient. Cardiac anesthesia always implies some respiratory monitoring; hence the existing clinical situation of the patient's respiratory system should be clear. In case of emergency surgery, the patient should be treated as if they potentially have or are at risk for the virus. In the case of a COVID-19 confirmed or suspected patient, attention must be made to preserve operating room and team integrity. The machineries are to be draped with plastic to simplify the disinfection after the operation. Perioperative management of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients must strictly follow the most relevant international guidelines.

483174,Estimates of COVID-19 cases across four Canadian Provinces,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) may alter the immune status and thus increase the susceptibility to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with MS or neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD). However, evidence supporting this notion is currently lacking. In this study, we conducted a survey on the risk of COVID-19 in patients with MS and NMOSD. METHODS: The survey was conducted through the Chinese Medical Network for Neuroinflammation. Patients in 10 MS centers from 8 cities including Wuhan were included. Information about MS and NMOSD disease duration and the usage of DMDs were collected. Data of suspected cases of COVID-19 were obtained from hospital visits, questionnaires, and patient self-reporting. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was confirmed through clinical evaluation by a panel of experts in conjunction with chest CT and viral RNA detection. RESULTS: Eight hundred eighty-two of 1,804 (48.89%) patients with MS and 2,129 of 3,060 (69.58%) patients with NMOSD were receiving DMDs. There were no alterations in the patients' DMD regimen during January 15, 2020, to March 15, 2020, the 3-month period. None of the patients with MS treated with DMDs had COVID-19. However, 2 patients with relapsing NMOSD were diagnosed with COVID-19-related pneumonia. After treatment, both patients recovered from pneumonia and neither patient experienced new attacks due to predisposing SARS-CoV-2 infection in the following 2 months. CONCLUSIONS: No increased risk of COVID-19 infection was observed in patients with MS or NMOSD, irrespective of whether these patients received DMDs. A battery of stringent preventive measures adopted by neurologists to reduce COVID-19 infection in these patients may have contributed to low risk of COVID-19 infection.","Fan, Moli; Qiu, Wei; Bu, Bitao; Xu, Yan; Yang, Huan; Huang, Dehui; Lau, Alexander Y; Guo, Jun; Zhang, Mei-Ni; Zhang, Xinghu; Yang, Chun-Sheng; Chen, Jingshan; Zheng, Pei; Liu, Qiang; Zhang, Chao; Shi, Fu-Dong",,,110

483389,The realities of a new era featuring truly international lectures during the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic: international collaboration and advances in medical education,2021,"BACKGROUND: Why human tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) cases differ from year to year, in some years more 100%, has not been clarified, yet. The cause of the increasing or decreasing trends is also controversial. Austria is the only country in Europe where a 40-year TBE time series and an official vaccine coverage time series are available to investigate these open questions. METHODS: A series of generalized linear models (GLMs) has been developed to identify demographic and environmental factors associated with the trend and the oscillations of the TBE time series. Both the observed and the predicted TBE time series were subjected to spectral analysis. The resulting power spectra indicate which predictors are responsible for the trend, the high-frequency and the low-frequency oscillations, and with which explained variance they contribute to the TBE oscillations. RESULTS: The increasing trend can be associated with the demography of the increasing human population. The responsible GLM explains 12% of the variance of the TBE time series. The low-frequency oscillations (10 years) are associated with the decadal changes of the large-scale climate in Central Europe. These are well described by the so-called Scandinavian index. This 10-year oscillation cycle is reinforced by the socio-economic predictor net migration. Considering the net migration and the Scandinavian index increases the explained variance of the GLM to 44%. The high-frequency oscillations (2-3 years) are associated with fluctuations of the natural TBE transmission cycle between small mammals and ticks, which are driven by beech fructification. Considering also fructification 2 years prior explains 64% of the variance of the TBE time series. Additionally, annual sunshine duration as predictor for the human outdoor activity increases the explained variance to 70%. CONCLUSIONS: The GLMs presented here provide the basis for annual TBE forecasts, which were mainly determined by beech fructification. A total of 3 of the 5 years with full fructification, resulting in high TBE case numbers 2 years later, occurred after 2010. The effects of climate change are therefore not visible through a direct correlation of the TBE cases with rising temperatures, but indirectly via the increased frequency of mast seeding.","Rubel, Franz; Walter, Melanie; Vogelgesang, Janna R; Brugger, Katharina",BMC Infect Dis,,110

486023,Conspiracy Theories and Their Societal Effects During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Online education has become a major reaction to the COVID-19 epidemic, which requires preschool teachers to quickly adapt to online education and accept educational technology. In this emergency background, research on the preschool teachers' technology acceptance provides clues to improve preschool teachers' intention to use educational technology. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is widely used to examine the process of individuals' technology acceptance in the previous literature. Therefore, this study seeks to examine preschool teachers' technology acceptance with the adapted TAM and their determinant factors. The proposed model was empirically validated by using survey data from 1,568 preschool teachers during the COVID-19. Results indicate that preschool teachers' behavioral intention was moderate to high level. Perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are direct significant predictors of preschool teachers' behavioral intention. Perceived usefulness is affected by perceived ease of use and job relevance. Computer self-efficacy and perceptions of external control are the positive factors toward perceived ease of use. Our findings present powerful evidence for the applicability of the adapted TAM in a sample of Chinese preschool teachers under emergency circumstances. These results highlighted some potential avenues for interventions aimed at improving preschool teachers' acceptance toward educational technology.","Hong, X.; Zhang, M.; Liu, Q.",Frontiers in Psychology,,110

489619,"First-Wave COVID-19 Pandemic in Greece: The Role of Demographic, Social, and Geographical Factors in Life Satisfaction during Lockdown",2021,"Background and objectives: the emergency department (ED) is frequently identified by patients as a possible solution for all healthcare problems, leading to a high rate of misuse of the ED, possibly causing overcrowding. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic started in China; it then spread throughout Italy, with the first cases confirmed in Lombardy, Italy, in February 2020. This has totally changed the type of patients referred to EDs. The aim of this study was to analyze the reduction of ED admissions at a Second level urban teaching (Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: in this retrospective observational cross-sectional study, we reviewed and compared clinical records of all the patients consecutively admitted to our ED over a 40-day period (21 February -31 March) in the last three years (2018-2019-2020). Mean age, sex, triage urgency level, day/night admission, main presentation symptom, and final diagnosis, according to different medical specialties, hospitalization, and discharge rate, were analyzed. Results: we analyzed 16,281 patient clinical records. The overall reduction in ED admissions in 2020 was 37.6% compared to 2019. In 2020, we observed an increase in triage urgency levels for ED admissions (the main presentation symptom was a fever). We noticed a significant drop in admissions for cardio-thoracic, gastroenterological, urological, otolaryngologic/ophthalmologic, and traumatological diseases. Acute neurological conditions registered only a slight, but significant, reduction. Oncology admissions were stable. Admissions for infectious diseases were 30% in 2020, compared to 5% and 6% in 2018 and 2019, respectively. In 2020, the hospitalization rate increased to 42.9% compared to 27.7%, and 26.4% in previous years. Conclusions: the drastic reduction of ED admissions during the pandemic may be associated with fear of the virus, suggesting that patients with serious illnesses did not go to the emergency room. Moreover, there was possible misuse of the ED in the previous year. In particular, worrisome data emerged regarding a drop in cardiology and neurology admissions. Those patients postponed medical attention, possibly with fatal consequences, just for fear of exposure to COVID-19, leading to unnecessary morbidity and mortality.","Ojetti, Veronica; Covino, Marcello; Brigida, Mattia; Petruzziello, Carmine; Saviano, Angela; Migneco, Alessio; Candelli, Marcello; Franceschi, Francesco",Medicina (Kaunas),,110

Having poor knowledge and attitude of the disease among health care providers could bring in impeded effect in the supportive treatment and, it increases the spread of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to assess the knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19, and associated factors among health care providers in Northwest Ethiopia in 2020. METHODS: Institution based cross-sectional study was conducted from the mid of March to the end of April 2020 among 408 participants who were selected by a simple random sampling technique. Pretested and structured self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. The data were entered using EPI-info v. 7, and were exported to SPSS version 20 for further analysis. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with Knowledge and Attitude towards COVID-19. Variables having p-value < 0.05 were taken as variables which were significantly associated with the dependent variable. RESULT: A total of 408(97.1%) participants have participated in the study. Most of the participants (67.3%) were males. One-third (35.5%) of the participants were nurses. About 62% of the health care providers were Bachelor degree holders. The prevalence of Knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 found to be 73.8% (95%CI: 69.9, 77.9) and 65.7% (95%CI: 61.5, 70.1) respectively.

497619,The hospital pharmacy in the creation of clean circuits in the face of COVID-19,2021,"PRCIS: Telepresence robots present the versatility to effectively provide remote educational sessions for patients affected by glaucoma to improve disease knowledge. Given COVID-19's effect on clinical practice, telepresence robots can maintain social distancing when educating patients. PURPOSE: Telepresence robots (TR) are devices that allow remote users to have a mobile presence anywhere. We compared the effect of an education session given by an in-person educator versus a TR on glaucoma knowledge and identified factors that impact patient education. METHODS: Eighty-five glaucoma patients were split into control, human, and TR groups. We measured glaucoma knowledge scores (KS) using the National Eye Institute's Eye-Q Test. Human and TR groups had the education session with a human or TR followed by the questionnaire. The control group was administered the questionnaire without an education session. Treatment regimen recall (RR) greater than 90% was considered a success. We used linear regression and binary logistic regression to determine variables that affect KS and RR, respectively. RESULTS: Mean age was 58.3±2.8 years. 49% were female. Mean KS were 5.8±0.7 in the control group (n=31), 7.9±0.5 in the TR group (n=26), and 8.4±0.5 in the human group (n=28). Control participants had a lower mean KS than the human or TR groups (P<0.001). Having the education session (2.5, P<0.001), education greater than high school (0.8, P=0.016), and diabetes (-0.7, P=0.037) affected KS. Having diabetes (OR=0.14, P=0.014) negatively affected RR. Having the education session may affect RR (OR=5.47, P=0.07), warranting additional studies. CONCLUSIONS: Education sessions with a human and TR improved patients' glaucoma KS. TRs may serve as an alternative to in-person education sessions and allow educators to safely and effectively educate patients remotely to adhere to COVID-19 social distancing guidelines.","Ooms, Ashley; Shaikh, Ibraheem; Patel, Nishant; Kardashian-Sieger, Thomas; Srinivasan, Nivetha; Zhou, Benjamin; Wilson, Logan; Szirth, Bernard; Khouri, Albert S",J. glaucoma,,110
497907,5PSQ-134 Analysis of factors related to the clinical course of COVID-19 infection in patients with hypertension,2021,"The massive shock of the COVID-19 pandemic is already showing its negative effects on economies around the world, unprecedented in recent history. COVID-19 infections and containment measures have caused a general slowdown in research and new knowledge production. Because of the link between R amd D spending and economic growth, it is to be expected then that a slowdown in research activities will slow in turn the global recovery from the pandemic. Many recent studies also claim an uneven impact on scientific production across gender. In this paper, we investigate the phenomenon across countries, analysing preprint depositions in bioRxiv. Differently from other works, that compare the number of preprint depositions before and after the pandemic outbreak, we analyse the depositions trends across geographical areas, and contrast after-pandemic depositions with expected ones. Differently from common belief and initial evidence, in few countries female scientists increased their scientific output while males plunged. © 2021 18th International Conference on Scientometrics and Informetrics, ISSI 2021.

Multifocal contact lenses (MFCLs) and orthokeratology (OK) reduce peripheral retinal hyperopic defocus, which animal studies have shown to positively impact eye growth. MFCLs are expected to slow myopic progression by 20â-â50% and OK by 30â-â60%, making them valuable therapeutic tools. In view of the guidelines for myopia management published by the International Myopia Institute in 2019, the aim of this retrospective data analysis of a tertiary care center was to review past experience with OK and MFCLs for myopia control and gain information to update current practice. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The contact lens (CL) database of the Eye Clinic of the University Hospital of Basel was searched with the label ""myopia progression"" between January 2012â-â2020. Patients were included if they gave informed consent, were younger than 19 years old at baseline, and had no ocular comorbidities that could potentially compromise vision. Primary outcomes were progression of spherical equivalent refraction for MFCL patients and progression of axial length (AL) for the OK group, comparing with historical data from OK trials. Secondary outcomes were the presence of risk factors for myopia, age, refractive error at baseline, follow-up duration, and adverse effects during therapy. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients could be included, with a mean age of 12.80 ± 3.32 years (y) at baseline. The majority of patients were older than 12 years and already myopic (- 3.89 ± 2.30 diopters) when control treatment was started. Overall, follow-up ranged from 0.08 to 6.33 years (2.03 ± 1.66 y). In the patients treated with MFCLs, myopia control improved significantly when patients changed from spectacles to MFCLs. In the OK group, 14% dropped out during the first year and 2 patients had multiple AL measurements during therapy, which showed a slower growth of AL when compared to other OK trials and controls with spectacles. There were two cases of non-severe keratitis. Environmental risk factors had not been documented and only 48% of clinical records had a documented family risk assessment. CONCLUSION: Patients showed a slower myopia progression under MFCLs or OK, which supports their role as a treatment option in myopia management. In this regard, AL measurement is an important additional parameter to be included in the assessment of myopia progression in clinical practice. Identification of children at risk of developing high/pathologic myopia (family history, environmental risk factors) needs to improve so that the first stages of myopic shift can be recognized and targeted. Changes in lifestyle should be actively encouraged, especially when the impact of decreases in outdoor time secondary to COVID-19 is yet to become clear.","Reis, Ana Paula Ribeiro; Palmowski-Wolfe, Anja; Beuschel, Ralf",Klin Monbl Augenheilkd,,110

500650,Anti-Covid vaccines: a look from the Collective Health,2020,"Interferons (IFN) are crucial for the innate immune response. Slightly more than two decades ago, a new type of IFN was discovered: the lambda IFN (type III IFN). Like other IFN, the type III IFN display antiviral activity against a wide variety of infections, they induce expression of antiviral, interferon-stimulated genes (MX1, OAS, IFITM1), and they have immuno-modulatory activities that shape adaptive immune responses. Unlike other IFN, the type III IFN signal through distinct receptors is limited to a few cell types, primarily mucosal epithelial cells. As a consequence of their greater and more durable production in nasal and respiratory tissues, they can determine the outcome of respiratory infections. This review is focused on the role of IFN-&#955; in the pathogenesis of respiratory viral infections, with influenza as a prime example. The influenza virus is a major public health problem, causing up to half a million lethal infections annually. Moreover, the virus has been the cause of four pandemics over the last century. Although IFN-&#955; are increasingly being tested in antiviral therapy, they can have a negative influence on epithelial tissue recovery and increase the risk of secondary bacterial infections. Therefore, IFN-&#955; expression deserves increased scrutiny as a key factor in the host immune response to infection.","Lozhkov, Alexey A; Klotchenko, Sergey A; Ramsay, Edward S; Moshkoff, Herman D; Moshkoff, Dmitry A; Vasin, Andrey V; Salvato, Maria S",,,110

In this regard, adolescents appear to be a highly vulnerable group, which is more affected than adults and children in many aspects. This study focuses on a specific and extremely maladaptive way of coping with mental stress and problems - deliberate self-harm. It offers an epidemiological study of the prevalence of self-harm among Slovak youths, its forms and related variables, carried out on a sample of 2,280 adolescents aged 11 - 19 using the SHI questionnaire. The results reveal that within the overall prevalence of 45.2%, the most vulnerable group are girls from non-traditional families who began to self-harm at an early age. The most frequent forms of self-harm among adolescents were torturing with self-defeating thoughts, followed by both direct and indirect forms of physical self-harm. An analysis of the willingness to disclose self-harming behaviour shows that the need to raise awareness of this behaviour should be mostly oriented towards adolescents.","Demuthova, S.; Demuth, A.",Brain-Broad Research in Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience,,110

Accumulating preclinical and clinical evidence indicates that the anticancer activity of CDK4/CDK6 inhibitors results not only from their ability to block the cell cycle in malignant cells but also from a range of immunostimulatory effects.

504749,A critique of the Indian government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Renal involvement in COVID-19 is less well characterized in settings with vigilant public health surveillance, including mass screening and early hospitalization. We assessed kidney complications among COVID-19 patients in Hong Kong, including the association with risk factors, length of hospitalization, critical presentation, and mortality. METHODS: Linked electronic records of all patients with confirmed COVID-19 from 5 major designated hospitals were extracted. Duplicated records due to interhospital transferal were removed. Primary outcome was the incidence of in-hospital acute kidney injury (AKI). Secondary outcomes were AKI-associated mortality, incident renal replacement therapy (RRT), intensive care admission, prolonged hospitalization and disease course (defined as >90th percentile of hospitalization duration [35 days] and duration from symptom onset to discharge [43 days], respectively), and change of estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Patients were further stratified into being symptomatic or asymptomatic. RESULTS: Patients were characterized by young age (median: 38.4, IQR: 28.4-55.8 years) and short time (median: 5, IQR: 2-9 days) from symptom onset to admission. Among the 591 patients, 22 (3.72%) developed AKI and 4 (0.68%) required RRT. The median time from symptom onset to in-hospital AKI was 15 days. AKI increased the odds of prolonged hospitalization and disease course by 2.0- and 3.5-folds, respectively. Estimated GFR 24 weeks post-discharge reduced by 7.51 and 1.06 mL/min/1.73 m2 versus baseline (upon admission) in the AKI and non-AKI groups, respectively. The incidence of AKI was comparable between asymptomatic (4.8%, n = 3/62) and symptomatic (3.7%, n = 19/519) patients. CONCLUSION: The overall rate of AKI among COVID-19 patients in Hong Kong is low, which could be attributable to a vigilant screening program and early hospitalization. Among patients who developed in-hospital AKI, the duration of hospitalization is prolonged and kidney function impairment can persist for up to 6 months post-discharge. Mass surveillance for COVID-19 is warranted in identifying asymptomatic subjects for earlier AKI management.","Chan, Kam Wa; Hung, Ivan Fan-Ngai; Tsang, Owen Tak-Yin; Wu, Tak Chiu; Tso, Eugene Yuk-Keung; Lung, Kwok Cheung; Lam, Chung Man; Chan, Gary Chi-Wang; Wong, Sunny Sze-Ho; Yu, Kam Yan; Chan, Johnny Wai-Man; Tang, Sydney Chi-Wai",Am J Nephrol,,110

We present the case of severe EVALI requiring venous-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vv-ECMO) and venting blowhole incisions.Case: A 32 year-old-male presented with four days of progressive dyspnea, productive cough and fatigue. He endorsed an active history of vaping cannabinoids and tobacco. On presentation, he was febrile, tachycardic and hypoxic requiring high amounts of supplemental oxygen. Lung exam was significant for diffuse rhonchi, wheezing and diminished breath sounds. Serology was remarkable for mild leukocytosis, procalcitonin 0.22 ng/mL and elevated inflammatory markers. Infectious work-up was negative. Chest radiography demonstrated bilateral multifocal patchy airspace disease. Empiric treatment with azithromycin and ceftriaxone was initiated. Intravenous dexamethasone and five days of remdesivir was started due to high suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection, despite negative results. On day 4, the patient rapidly deteriorated, requiring mechanical ventilation. Computed tomography angiography demonstrated pneumomediastinum and bilateral ground glass opacities concerning for EVALI. He subsequently developed bilateral apical pneumothoraces requiring chest tube placement, and refractory subcutaneous emphysema prompting venting blowhole incisions. On day 20, vv-ECMO was initiated due to worsening respiratory status. During this time, he underwent tracheostomy placement. He was decannulated on day 34 of hospitalization and weaned to trach mask, currently awaiting rehabilitation placement.Discussion: EVALI is an emerging pulmonary syndrome with clinical presentation ranging from cough and dyspnea to spontaneous pneumothorax and acute respiratory failure. Patients typically require a high level of care. One study observes a 67% admission rate to intensive care, of that group 8% requiring mechanical ventilation. Numerous investigations have established an association between vitamin E acetate (VEA), an additive in vaping solvents containing tetrahydrocannabinol, and inflammatory alveolar damage. Lipid-laden macrophages have been reported in 89% of patients with suspected EVALI following bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Other studies suggest BAL macrophage increase in a VEA dose-dependent manner. Thoracic imaging typically reveals consolidations with basilar predominance and diffuse ground glass opacities. EVALI remains a diagnosis of exclusion. Given the similarity in presentation between EVALI and infectious/autoimmune pulmonary processes, patients receive empiric antimicrobial therapy, high dose steroids, and supplemental oxygen with improvement. Literature on EVALI and ECMO treatment is limited, with a need for further studies on management to prevent severe consequences. This is a case in which the patient required additional therapies, including both ECMO and venting blowhole incisions.","Klibanoff-Dombrowski, K.; Simeone, S.; Chigurupati, N.; Nguyen, S.; Parikh, R.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,110

METHODS: In this randomized, crossover manikin study, we recruited 37 medical personnel with > 2 years of dedicated anesthesia experience from five hospitals. After the three successful intubations within 60 s using each laryngoscope without a box, the participants performed tracheal intubation thrice with each laryngoscope with at least 2-h intervals in a determined order. The primary outcome was the intubation time. The secondary outcomes were success rate, Cormack-Lehane grade, and subjective difficulty scale score. RESULTS: Thirty-seven personnel (11 women and 26 men) with 12 [5-19] (median [interquartile range]) years of anesthesia and intensive care experience were enrolled. There was no significant difference in the intubation time: 30 [26-32] s for Macintosh, 29 [26-32] s for i-view, and 29 [25-31] s for C-MAC (P = 0.247). The success rate was 95-100%, without a significant difference (P = 0.135). The i-view and C-MAC exhibited superior Cormack-Lehane grades and lower subjective difficulty scale scores than the Macintosh; however, there were no differences between the i-view and C-MAC. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid and highly successful tracheal intubation was possible with both Macintosh, i-view, and C-MAC on a normal airway manikin in an aerosol box. Improved Cormack-Lehane grade and the ease of performing the procedure may support the use of video laryngoscopes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, UMIN000040269 .

METHODS: This was a cohort study evaluating the first month of intelligent lockdown in the Netherlands (12 March to 8 April 2020) compared with one baseline month (13 February to 11 March 2020). We identified 870 migraine patients treated at the Leiden Headache Center with headache e-diaries during the period of interest. Adherence to the e-diary had to be &#8805;80%, yielding 592 enrolled patients. RESULTS: Intelligent lockdown led to a decrease in monthly migraine days (-0.48; 95% CI: -0.78 to -0.18, p = 0.002) and acute medication days (-0.48; 95% CI: -0.76 to -0.20, p < 0.001), and an increase in general well-being (0.11; 95% CI: 0.06 to 0.17, p < 0.001). No differences in non-migrainous headache days and pain coping were observed. Consistent results were found in a subset that was followed for 4 months. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings imply that intelligent lockdown measures can improve migraine disability despite of the potential negative effects of COVID-19 and lockdown. We hypothesise that this effect is a combined result of working from home, scaling down demanding social lives, and freedom to choose how to organise one's time.","Verhagen, Iris E; van Casteren, Daphne S; de Vries Lentsch, Simone; Terwindt, Gisela M",Cephalalgia,,110
510325,Is COVID-19 Immune to Misinformation? A Brief Overview,2021,"OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 pandemic caused several alarming challenges for clinical trials. On-site source data verification (SDV) in the multicenter clinical trial became difficult due to travel ban and social distancing. For multicenter clinical trials, centralized data monitoring is an efficient and cost-effective method of data monitoring. Centralized data monitoring reduces the risk of COVID-19 infections and provides additional capabilities compared to on-site monitoring. The key steps for on-site monitoring include identifying key risk factors and thresholds for the risk factors, developing a monitoring plan, following up the risk factors, and providing a management plan to mitigate the risk. METHODS: For analysis purposes, we simulated data similar to our clinical trial data. We classified the data monitoring process into two groups, such as the Supervised analysis process, to follow each patient remotely by creating a dashboard and an Unsupervised analysis process to identify data discrepancy, data error, or data fraud. We conducted several risk-based statistical analysis techniques to avoid on-site source data verification to reduce time and cost, followed up with each patient remotely to maintain social distancing, and created a centralized data monitoring dashboard to ensure patient safety and maintain the data quality. CONCLUSION: Data monitoring in clinical trials is a mandatory process. A risk-based centralized data review process is cost-effective and helpful to ignore on-site data monitoring at the time of the pandemic. We summarized how different statistical methods could be implemented and explained in SAS to identify various data error or fabrication issues in multicenter clinical trials.","Afroz, Most Alina; Schwarber, Grant; Bhuiyan, Mohammad Alfrad Nobel",Contemp Clin Trials,,110

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched using a combination of related MeSH terms and keywords. STUDY SELECTION: Cohort studies and case controls investigating common anesthetic and critical care aerosol-generating procedures and transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 to healthcare workers were included for quantitative analysis. DATA EXTRACTION: Qualitative and quantitative data on the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus to healthcare workers via aerosol-generating procedures in anesthesia and critical care were collected independently. The Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies - of Interventions tool was used to assess the risk of bias of included studies. DATA SYNTHESIS: Seventeen studies out of 2,676 yielded records were included for meta-analyses. Endotracheal intubation (odds ratio, 6.69, 95% CI, 3.81-11.72; p < 0.001), noninvasive ventilation (odds ratio, 3.65; 95% CI, 1.86-7.19; p < 0.001), and administration of nebulized medications (odds ratio, 10.03; 95% CI, 1.98-50.69; p = 0.005) were found to increase the odds of healthcare workers contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The use of N95 masks (odds ratio, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.03-0.39; p < 0.001), gowns (odds ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.48-0.73; p < 0.001), and gloves (odds ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.29-0.53; p < 0.001) were found to be significantly protective of healthcare workers from contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. CONCLUSIONS: Specific aerosol-generating procedures are high risk for the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 from patients to healthcare workers.

METHODS: An online cross-sectional self-report survey was distributed via disability service providers and support groups. Care givers of children aged 2-17 years with a NDD were invited to respond to questions on child symptom severity and well-being, parent well-being and service access and satisfaction. RESULTS: Overall, 302 care givers (94.7% female) completed the survey. Average child age was 9.7 years and 66.9% were male. Worsening of any child NDD or comorbid mental health symptom was reported by 64.5% of respondents and 76.9% reported child health and well-being was impacted by COVID-19. Children were viewing more television and digital media (81.6%), exercising less (68.0%), experiencing reduced sleep quality (43.6%) and had a poorer diet (32.4%). Almost one fifth (18.8%) of families reported an increase in the dosage of medication administered to their child. Parents reported COVID-19 had impacted their own well-being (76.1%). Over half of respondents were not satisfied with services received during COVID-19 (54.8%) and just 30% reported that telehealth works well for their child. CONCLUSION: Targeted interventions are required to address worsening child neurodevelopmental disability, mental health symptoms and poor diet, sleep and exercise patterns. Improved access to telehealth services is indicated, as is further research on barriers and enablers of effective telehealth services.","Masi, Anne; Mendoza Diaz, Antonio; Tully, Lucy; Azim, Syeda Ishra; Woolfenden, Susan; Efron, Daryl; Eapen, Valsamma",J. paediatr. child health,,110

518586,From the CEO,2021,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular events have been reported in the setting of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). It has been hypothesized that systemic inflammation may aggravate arrhythmias or trigger new-onset conduction abnormalities. However, the specific type and distribution of electrocardiographic disturbances in COVID-19 as well as their influence on mortality remain to be fully characterized. METHODS: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) were obtained from 186 COVID-19-positive patients at a large tertiary care hospital in Northern Nevada. The following arrhythmias were identified by cardiologists: sinus bradycardia, sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation (A-Fib), atrial flutter, multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT), premature atrial contraction (PAC), premature ventricular contraction (PVC), atrioventricular block (AVB), and right bundle branch block (RBBB). The mean PR interval, QRS duration, and corrected QT interval were documented. Fisher's exact test was used to compare the ECG features of patients who died during the hospitalization with those who survived. The influence of ECG features on mortality was assessed with multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A-Fib, atrial flutter, and ST-segment depression were predictive of mortality. In addition, the mean ventricular rate was higher among patients who died as compared to those who survived. The use of therapeutic anticoagulation was associated with reduced odds of death; however, this association did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: The underlying pathogenesis of COVID-19-associated arrhythmias remains to be established, but we postulate that systemic inflammation and/or hypoxia may induce potentially lethal conduction abnormalities in affected individuals. Longitudinal studies are warranted to evaluate the risk factors, pathogenesis, and management of COVID-19-associated cardiac arrhythmias.","Antwi-Amoabeng, Daniel; Beutler, Bryce D; Singh, Sahajpreet; Taha, Moutaz; Ghuman, Jasmine; Hanfy, Ahmed; Manasewitsch, Nicholas T; Ulanja, Mark B; Ghuman, Joban; Awad, Munadel; Gullapalli, Nageshwara; Gbadebo, T David",Ann Noninvasive Electrocardiol,,110

518981,Termination of the Individual Contract of Work Due to Unforeseen Circumstances or Force Majeure Mat Makes It Impossible to Work in times of Pandemic Covid-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The current COVID-19 disease pandemic has delayed nonurgent orthopaedic procedures to adequately care for those affected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, resulting in a backlog in orthopaedic surgical care. As the capacity for orthopaedic surgeries expands or contracts, allocation of limited resources in a manner that adequately reflects medical necessity and urgency is paramount. An orthopaedic surgery-specific prioritization schema with proven reliability is lacking. The primary aim of this study was to assess the reliability of a newly developed prioritization list used for the phased reinstatement of orthopaedic surgical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic and afterward. The secondary aim was to report its implementation. METHODS: A consensus-based, orthopaedic surgery-specific, tiered prioritization list reflecting various levels of urgency was created by a committee of orthopaedic surgeons covering all subspecialties and representing academic, multispecialty, and private community practices. Reliability was tested for 63 randomized cases representing all orthopaedic subspecialties. Four raters evaluated the cases independently at two separate time points, at least one week apart. Fleiss kappa was used to assess intrarater and interrater agreement. Implementation were assessed by surveying both surgeons and the surgery scheduling administrative personnel at each surgical facility within a large health system for any adoption issues. RESULTS: Case distributions within tiers 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 35%, 14%, 27%, and 24%, respectively. Interrater agreement ranged from 0.63 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57 to 0.69) to 0.72 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.78) for the ratings. Intrarater reliability ranged from 0.62 to 1.0. The highest levels of agreement were in tiers 1, 4, and the subspecialties oncology and foot/ankle. The time from development to full scale adoption and implementation by all orthopaedic surgeons was rapid. DISCUSSION: This tiered prioritization list for orthopaedic procedures is both adoptable and reliable during the phased reinstatement of procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic and afterward. Further refinements may enhance utility.

Students shared perspectives on Twitter about their engagement, and research data was collected from their tweets posted between March and May 2020. A total of 124,810 tweets were analysed using MAXQDA quantitative and qualitative tools. The findings indicate that students' engagement with learning and assessment was affected by the challenges of the sudden shift in learning mode and alterations in assessment methods. Open communication between students and faculty are essential for ensuring shared understanding and acceptance. Additionally, departmental support and mediating between students and faculty members is necessary and should be a priority in cases where communication is lacking. Results are discussed in relation to current literature, research implications, and future directions.","Almossa, Samar Yakoob",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),,110

591047,Effectively engaging physicians in system change,2020-10-28,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses new challenges for caregivers of adults with chronic or disabling conditions. This study uses nationally representative data to examine the prevalence of pandemic care challenges and supports and their associations with caregiver mental health and interpersonal well-being. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants include 311 caregivers aged 50–80 in the United States who were providing care for an adult with a chronic or disabling condition from the June 2020 National Poll on Healthy Aging. Five care challenges (e.g., confusion on public health guidelines) and 2 supports (e.g., physician offered information on care during COVID-19) are treated as predictors of caregiver mental health (care-related stress, self-reported mental health, and depressive symptoms) and interpersonal well-being (interpersonal conflicts, lack of companionship, and isolation). RESULTS: Each care challenge/support was endorsed by 13%–23% of caregivers. In adjusted models, difficulty getting needed medical care was associated with greater caregiver stress, depressive symptoms, and lower interpersonal well-being. All care challenges universally predicted greater caregiver stress. Caregiving supports were not independently associated with caregiver’ mental health and interpersonal well-being. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Care challenges were associated with caregivers’ mental health and interpersonal well-being during the early months of the pandemic. Some of these challenges may be attributed to changing public health guidelines and practices as the pandemic unfolded, whereas others are relevant to all care contexts (e.g., less support from family). Tools and supports for caregivers must consider both changing policies and care needs.","Leggett, Amanda N; Carmichael, Alicia; Leonard, Natalie; Jackson, Jeannette; Kirch, Matthias; Solway, Erica; Kullgren, Jeffrey T; Singer, Dianne; Malani, Preeti N; Gonzalez, Richard",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34632106/; https://doi.org/10.1093/geroni/igab031,110
591243,How I Do It: A Strategy for Undergraduate Medical Education in Urology During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-09-14,"INTRODUCTION: Obesity worsens clinical outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The aim of this study was to measure the association between history of bariatric surgery and the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: Data source included PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and pre-print servers between January and November 1, 2020. Literature was screened and selected to extract the relevant data. The two outcomes of this meta-analysis were the difference in mortality and hospitalization rates in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with and without history of bariatric surgery. Random-effect models were used to estimate the pooled effects. RESULTS: The systematic review yielded 3 retrospective studies on 9022 patients. The risk of mortality without previous bariatric surgery was 133 per 1000 cases and its risk with previous bariatric surgery was 33 per 1000 (summary OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.19–0.26). No heterogeneity was observed between the included studies (I(2) = 0%, P = 0.98 for heterogeneity). In the pooled analysis, the hospitalization rate in patients without previous bariatric surgery was 412 per 1000 cases and its rate in patients with previous bariatric surgery was 164 per 1000 (summary OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.12–0.65). No heterogeneity was observed between the included studies (I(2) = 0%, P = 0.71 for heterogeneity). There was a substantial risk of bias across the studies for confounding and selection bias. CONCLUSION: Findings of this meta-analysis of observational studies suggest that prior bariatric surgery is associated with a lower rate of mortality and hospital admission in patients with obesity who become infected with SARS-CoV-2. Confirmation of these findings will require larger studies with better quality data.","Aminian, Ali; Tu, Chao",Obes Surg,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-020-05213-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33420671/,110

Still, the danger of a second wave of infections is omnipresent and it is clear, that every policy of the lockdown has to be carefully evaluated and possibly replaced by a different, less restrictive policy, before it can be lifted. Tracing of contacts and consequential tracing and breaking of infection-chains is a promising and comparably straightforward strategy to help containing the disease, although its precise impact on the epidemic is unknown. In order to quantify the benefits of tracing and similar policies we developed an agent-based model that not only validly depicts the spread of the disease, but allows for exploratory analysis of containment policies. We will describe our model and perform case studies in which we use the model to quantify impact of contact tracing in different characteristics and draw valuable conclusions about contact tracing policies in general.","Bicher, M.

591532,Emerging from COVID-19: Lessons for Action on Climate Change and Health in Cities,2021-03-01,"Abstract We have previously shown that cells infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) bind rabbit, mouse, and rat IgG by the Fc portion of the IgG molecule. This Fc-binding activity appeared to be mediated by the MHV S protein. S protein could also be precipitated from MHV-infected cells by a monoclonal antibody directed against the murine Fc γ receptor (FcγR). To prove definitively that the S protein mediates Fc-binding activity, we have expressed the MHV S protein utilizing recombinant vaccinia viruses. The anti-FcγR monoclonal antibody, 2.4G2, precipitated recombinant S protein in cells of murine, human, and rabbit origin. Since the anti-Fc receptor monoclonal antibody does not react with human and rabbit Fc receptors these results demonstrate that the epitope recognized by this antibody is carried on the MHV S protein and is not murine in origin. Examination of various MHV isolates and escape mutants failed to identify the precise sequences in S responsible for the molecular mimicry of the murine FcγR. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that a previously identified region of similarity between the S protein and the FcγR mediates this activity. The Fc binding activity of S was expressed on the cell surface, since MHV-JHM-infected cells, but not uninfected cells, formed rosettes with anti-sheep red blood cell (SRBC) antibody-coated SRBC. The anti-FcγR monoclonal antibody neutralized MHV-JHM and inhibited syncytium formation induced by the MHV S protein.","Oleszak, Emilia L.; Perlman, Stanley; Leibowitz, Julian L.",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229290066X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229290066X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1309271/,110
591647,The potentially conflicted evaluations of others based on their intelligence(),2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND: On 31 March 2013, the first human infections with the novel influenza A/H7N9 virus were reported in Eastern China. The outbreak expanded rapidly in geographic scope and size, with a total of 132 laboratory-confirmed cases reported by 3 June 2013, in 10 Chinese provinces and Taiwan. The incidence of A/H7N9 cases has stalled in recent weeks, presumably as a consequence of live bird market closures in the most heavily affected areas. Here we compare the transmission potential of influenza A/H7N9 with that of other emerging pathogens and evaluate the impact of intervention measures in an effort to guide pandemic preparedness. METHODS: We used a Bayesian approach combined with a SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed) transmission model fitted to daily case data to assess the reproduction number (R) of A/H7N9 by province and to evaluate the impact of live bird market closures in April and May 2013. Simulation studies helped quantify the performance of our approach in the context of an emerging pathogen, where human-to-human transmission is limited and most cases arise from spillover events. We also used alternative approaches to estimate R based on individual-level information on prior exposure and compared the transmission potential of influenza A/H7N9 with that of other recent zoonoses. RESULTS: Estimates of R for the A/H7N9 outbreak were below the epidemic threshold required for sustained human-to-human transmission and remained near 0.1 throughout the study period, with broad 95% credible intervals by the Bayesian method (0.01 to 0.49). The Bayesian estimation approach was dominated by the prior distribution, however, due to relatively little information contained in the case data. We observe a statistically significant deceleration in growth rate after 6 April 2013, which is consistent with a reduction in A/H7N9 transmission associated with the preemptive closure of live bird markets. Although confidence intervals are broad, the estimated transmission potential of A/H7N9 appears lower than that of recent zoonotic threats, including avian influenza A/H5N1, swine influenza H3N2sw and Nipah virus. CONCLUSION: Although uncertainty remains high in R estimates for H7N9 due to limited epidemiological information, all available evidence points to a low transmission potential. Continued monitoring of the transmission potential of A/H7N9 is critical in the coming months as intervention measures may be relaxed and seasonal factors could promote disease transmission in colder months.","Chowell, Gerardo; Simonsen, Lone; Towers, Sherry; Miller, Mark A; Viboud, Cécile",BMC Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24083506/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1741-7015-11-214,110

Although numerous studies have investigated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on universities in the Middle East, none have reflected on the process through which medical education programs for health professions underwent this transition. This study aimed to elucidate the rapid transition to distance-learning of an undergraduate medical program at the College of Medicine, Mohammad Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences (Dubai, United Arab Emirates), owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. An action research approach constituted the foundation of this collaborative effort that involved investigations, reflections, and improvements of practice, through ongoing cycles of planning, acting, observing, and reflecting. Efforts of transitioning to distance-learning were grouped into four interrelated aspects: supporting faculty members in delivering the program content, managing curriculum changes, engaging with the students to facilitate distance-learning experiences, and conducting web-based assessments. Challenges included the high perceived uncertainty, need for making ad hoc decisions, lack of experiential learning and testing of clinical skills, and blurring of work-life boundaries. Our preliminary findings show the successful generation of a strong existing digital base, future prospects for innovation, and a cohesive team that was key to agility, rapid decision-making, and program implementation.","Du Plessis, Stefan S; Otaki, Farah; Zaher, Shroque; Zary, Nabil; Inuwa, Ibrahim; Lakhtakia, Ritu",JMIR Med Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34227994/; https://doi.org/10.2196/27010,110

Yet, the main epidemic parameters of this virus are not well understood. In the absence of broad testing or serological surveillance, it is hard to evaluate or predict the impact of different strategies to exit implemented lock-down measures. An age-structured epidemiological model was developed, which distinguishes between the younger versus older population (e.g. < 65 and >= 65). Because the illness severity is markedly different for these two populations, such a separation is necessary then estimating the model based on death and hospitalization incidence data. The model was applied to data of the Belgian epidemic and used to predict how the epidemic would react to a relaxing of social distancing measures.","Deforche, K.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.23.20077115v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.23.20077115,110

METHODS: A community telephone survey was conducted with 230 Chinese adolescents. Random-digit dialing of the local residential telephone directory was used to select respondents, who were asked to provide information on their practice of SARS preventive health behaviors and associated factors as specified by the Health Belief Model. These factors included perceived threat of SARS, perceived benefits and barriers in practicing SARS preventive health behaviors, cues to action, knowledge of SARS, and self-efficacy. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to determine salient correlates of habitual and volitional health behaviors against SARS. RESULTS: About 54.8% of respondents reported practicing all three recommended habitual health behaviors. Another 47.8% indicated consistent practice of volitional health behavior of facemask-wearing to prevent SARS. Results of hierarchical regression analyses showed that habitual health behaviors against SARS were related to perceived health threat and environmental cues. For facemask-wearing, salient correlates were environmental cues, rates of SARS habitual health behaviors, younger age, and perceived health threat.

Therefore, it has been essential to study the quality of life, especially in vulnerable populations, including children and adolescents. In this work, the psychological well-being, distribution of tasks and routines, as well as the physical activity done by children and adolescents from two samples: community and high abilities, have been analyzed. The methodology used was Mixed Method Research, through a survey conducted online through social networks. The informants were the parents of the children and adolescents, 209 in the community sample and 116 in the high ability sample. The instrument used was a questionnaire implemented through Google Forms, with open and closed questions, including the Kidscreen-27 scale to measure well-being. The assessment of the adequacy of the physical activity levels was analyzed through ALCESTE. The results showed the absence of differences between students from community samples and those with high capacities in well-being and physical activity. Parents residing in Spain observed less play time in the high ability sample, and more time spent on homework, whether or not they have a diagnosis of high ability. It is concluded that these results question the misconceptions held about high ability students in terms of poorer personal adjustment and better interest in physical activities.","Valadez, María de los Dolores; Rodríguez-Naveiras, Elena; Castellanos-Simons, Doris; López-Aymes, Gabriela; Aguirre, Triana; Flores, Juan Francisco; Borges, África",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.606167; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33408671/,110

So, food safety must be a priority for these establishments, especially during the COVID‐19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of training intervention on the health and food safety knowledge, attitude, and self‐reported practice (KAP) of restaurant food handlers during the COVID‐19 pandemic. This quasi‐experimental study was conducted on 159 restaurant food handlers in Tehran, Iran. The training intervention was developed based on the latest global guidelines. The KAP of the subjects was measured before and after the training. Fisher's exact test, paired t test, and repeated measures ANOVA were used for statistical analysis. Data analysis was done using the IBM_SPSS software. The total knowledge scores of participants were low (17.6%), moderate (35.2%), and good (47.2%) before training, which were changed to 5% (low), 23.9% (moderate), and 71.1% (good) after training. The total pretraining attitude scores were 0.6, 77.4, 18.2, and 3.8% that were changed to 0% (strongly negative), 49.1% (negative), 33.3% (positive), and 17.6% (strongly positive), respectively. Also, the self‐reported practice scores of the participants before training were 1.3, 56, and 42.7 that were changed to 0% (weak), 26.4% (acceptable), and 73.6% (desirable) after the intervention, respectively. Paired t test results showed a statistically significant increase in all scores. The interaction of training with age and education was statistically significant in increasing the knowledge and attitude scores of the participants by the repeated measures ANOVA. Improving the KAP of food handlers by health and food safety training can improve the status of restaurants and minimize the outbreak of pandemic diseases, including COVID‐19, which is an effective step in community health.

Here, we present the development and validation of a high‐throughput multiplex bead‐based serological assay. METHODS: More than 100 representations of SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins were included for initial evaluation, including antigens produced in bacterial and mammalian hosts as well as synthetic peptides. The five best‐performing antigens, three representing the spike glycoprotein and two representing the nucleocapsid protein, were further evaluated for detection of IgG antibodies in samples from 331 COVID‐19 patients and convalescents, and in 2090 negative controls sampled before 2020. RESULTS: Three antigens were finally selected, represented by a soluble trimeric form and the S1‐domain of the spike glycoprotein as well as by the C‐terminal domain of the nucleocapsid. The sensitivity for these three antigens individually was found to be 99.7%, 99.1% and 99.7%, and the specificity was found to be 98.1%, 98.7% and 95.7%. The best assay performance was although achieved when utilising two antigens in combination, enabling a sensitivity of up to 99.7% combined with a specificity of 100%. Requiring any two of the three antigens resulted in a sensitivity of 99.7% and a specificity of 99.4%. CONCLUSION: These observations demonstrate that a serological test based on a combination of several SARS‐CoV‐2 antigens enables a highly specific and sensitive multiplex serological COVID‐19 assay.","Hober, Sophia; Hellström, Cecilia; Olofsson, Jennie; Andersson, Eni; Bergström, Sofia; Jernbom Falk, August; Bayati, Shaghayegh; Mravinacova, Sara; Sjöberg, Ronald; Yousef, Jamil; Skoglund, Lovisa; Kanje, Sara; Berling, Anna; Svensson, Anne‐Sophie; Jensen, Gabriella; Enstedt, Henric; Afshari, Delaram; Xu, Lan Lan; Zwahlen, Martin; von Feilitzen, Kalle; Hanke, Leo; Murrell, Ben; McInerney, Gerald; Karlsson Hedestam, Gunilla B; Lendel, Christofer; Roth, Robert G; Skoog, Ingmar; Svenungsson, Elisabet; Olsson, Tomas; Fogdell‐Hahn, Anna; Lindroth, Ylva; Lundgren, Maria; Maleki, Kimia T; Lagerqvist, Nina; Klingström, Jonas; Da Silva Rodrigues, Rui; Muschiol, Sandra; Bogdanovic, Gordana; Arroyo Mühr, Laila Sara; Eklund, Carina; Lagheden, Camilla; Dillner, Joakim; Sivertsson, Åsa; Havervall, Sebastian; Thålin, Charlotte; Tegel, Hanna; Pin, Elisa; Månberg, Anna; Hedhammar, My; Nilsson, Peter",Clin Transl Immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34295471/; https://doi.org/10.1002/cti2.1312,110

Objective: To examine how COVID-19 and its societal related restrictions have impacted the provision of healthcare support for pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: A thematic analysis using an inductive approach was undertaken of data from open-ended responses using data from the national COVID in Context of Pregnancy, Infancy and Parenting (CoCoPIP) Study online survey (N = 507 families). Results: The overarching theme identified was the way in which the changes to healthcare provision increased parents' anxiety levels, and feelings of not being supported. Five sub-themes, associated with the first wave of the pandemic, were identified: (1) rushed and/or fewer antenatal appointments, (2) lack of sympathy from healthcare workers, (3) lack of face-to-face appointments, (4) requirement to attend appointments without a partner, and (5) requirement to use PPE. A sentiment analysis, that used quantitative techniques, revealed participant responses to be predominantly negative (50.1%), with a smaller proportion of positive (21.8%) and neutral (28.1%) responses found. Conclusion: This study provides evidence indicating that the changes to healthcare services for pregnant women during the pandemic increased feelings of anxiety and have left women feeling inadequately supported.

METHODS: We conducted a phase 3 multi-centre open-label, randomized 1:1:1:1:1, adaptive, controlled trial (DisCoVeRy), add-on trial to Solidarity (NCT04315948, EudraCT2020-000936-23). The primary outcome was the clinical status at day 15, measured by the WHO 7-point ordinal scale. Secondary outcomes included SARS-CoV-2 quantification in respiratory specimens, pharmacokinetic and safety analyses. We report the results for the lopinavir/ritonavir-containing arms and for the hydroxychloroquine arm, which were stopped prematurely. RESULTS: The intention-to-treat population included 583 participants (lopinavir/ritonavir, n=145; lopinavir/ritonavir-IFN-β-1a, n=145; hydroxychloroquine, n=145; control, n=148), among whom 418 (71.7%) were male, the median age was 63 years (IQR, 54-71) and 211 (36.2%) had a severe disease. The day-15 clinical status was not improved with investigational treatments: lopinavir/ritonavir versus control, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.83, (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55-1.26, P=0.39); lopinavir/ritonavir-IFN-β-1a versus control, aOR 0.69 (95%CI 0.45-1.04, P=0.08); hydroxychloroquine versus control, aOR 0.93 (95%CI 0.62-1.41, P=0.75). No significant effect of investigational treatment was observed on SARS-CoV-2 clearance. Trough plasma concentrations of lopinavir and ritonavir were higher than those expected, while those of hydroxychloroquine were those expected with the dosing regimen.

601438,Characteristics of Adaptation in Undergraduate University Students Suddenly Exposed to Fully Online Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-09-13,"As global public health is under threat by the 2019-nCoV and a potential new wave of large-scale epidemic outbreak and spread is looming, an imminent question to ask is what the optimal strategy of epidemic prevention and control (P&C) measures would be, especially in terms of the timing of enforcing aggressive policy response so as to maximize health efficacy and to contain pandemic spread. Based on the current global pandemic statistic data, here we developed a logistic probability function configured SEIR model to analyse the COVID-19 outbreak and estimate its transmission pattern under different “anticipate- or delay-to-activate” policy response scenarios in containing the pandemic. We found that the potential positive effects of stringent pandemic P&C measures would be almost canceled out in case of significantly delayed action, whereas a partially procrastinatory wait-and-see control policy may still be able to contribute to containing the degree of epidemic spread although its effectiveness may be significantly compromised compared to a scenario of early intervention coupled with stringent P&C measures. A laissez-faire policy adopted by the government and health authority to tackling the uncertainly of COVID19-type pandemic development during the early stage of the outbreak turns out to be a high risk strategy from optimal control perspective, as significant damages would be produced as a consequence.","Li, Jun; Ye, Lingjian; Zhou, Yimin; Zhang, Joy Y.; Chen, Zhuo",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.613980; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34414148/,110

601680,COVID-19 social distancing and sexual activity in a sample of the British Public,2020-05-14,"Abortion and neonatal mortality are events that can occur in breeding bitches and queens. It has been reported that up to 55% and 33% of these cases remain without a known cause, respectively, in canine and feline pregnancies. Unusual abortigenic and potentially zoonotic agents, including Coxiella burnetii and Leptospira spp., may be involved in these cases. C. burnetii is able to cause reproductive disorders in cattle, sheep and goats, and cases of abortion have been observed in dogs and cats. Moreover, several outbreaks of C. burnetii infection in humans have been caused by delivering bitches and queens, and some of these animals experienced abortion. Leptospira interrogans sensu lato is able to cause abortion or stillbirth in several animal species and its abortigenic role has occasionally been described in bitches and queens. The aim of this study was to search for C. burnetii and Leptospira spp. DNA in a retrospective series of 103 cases of canine and feline abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality submitted for the identification of possible infectious agents. One hundred and fifty-one specimens were tested using PCR assays and found negative for C. burnetii and Leptospira DNA. However, in 49 samples (47.6%) other infectious causes of abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality were identified. These results showed that C. burnetii and Leptospira spp. are probably not common abortigenic agents or causes of neonatal deaths in dogs. However, given the potential abortigentic and zoonotic role of these agents, surveillance of canine and feline abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality could be advisable for a systematic investigation of these events.","Stefanetti, Valentina; Compagnone, Agnese; Sordini, Chiara; Passamonti, Fabrizio; Rampacci, Elisa; Moscati, Livia; Marenzoni, Maria Luisa",Top Companion Anim Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30502862/; https://doi.org/10.1053/j.tcam.2018.08.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S193897361830059X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S193897361830059X,110
602150,Social Media and Medical Education in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Scoping Review,2021-04-12,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2)-induced infection, the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is characterized by unprecedented clinical pathologies. One of the most important pathologies, is hypercoagulation and microclots in the lungs of patients. Here we study the effect of isolated SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit as potential inflammagen sui generis. Using scanning electron and fluorescence microscopy as well as mass spectrometry, we investigate the potential of this inflammagen to interact with platelets and fibrin(ogen) directly to cause blood hypercoagulation. Using platelet-poor plasma (PPP), we show that spike protein may interfere with blood flow. Mass spectrometry also showed that when spike protein S1 is added to healthy PPP, it results in structural changes to β and γ fibrin(ogen), complement 3, and prothrombin. These proteins were substantially resistant to trypsinization, in the presence of spike protein S1. Here we suggest that, in part, the presence of spike protein in circulation may contribute to the hypercoagulation in COVID-19 positive patients and may cause substantial impairment of fibrinolysis. Such lytic impairment may result in the persistent large microclots we have noted here and previously in plasma samples of COVID-19 patients. This observation may have important clinical relevance in the treatment of hypercoagulability in COVID-19 patients.","Grobbelaar, Lize M.; Venter, Chantelle; Vlok, Mare; Ngoepe, Malebogo; Laubscher, Gert Jacobus; Lourens, Petrus Johannes; Steenkamp, Janami; Kell, Douglas B.; Pretorius, Etheresia",Biosci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1042/bsr20210611; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34328172/,110

However, little research has been conducted on bat coronaviruses in South Korea. In this study, bat samples (332 oral swabs, 245 fecal samples, 38 urine samples, and 57 bat carcasses) were collected at 33 natural bat habitat sites in South Korea. RT-PCR and sequencing were performed for specific coronavirus genes to identify the bat coronaviruses in different bat samples. Coronaviruses were detected in 2.7% (18/672) of the samples: 13 oral swabs from one species of the family Rhinolophidae, and four fecal samples and one carcass (intestine) from three species of the family Vespertiliodae. To determine the genetic relationships of the 18 sequences obtained in this study and previously known coronaviruses, the nucleotide sequences of a 392-nt region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene were analyzed phylogenetically. Thirteen sequences belonging to SARS-like betacoronaviruses showed the highest nucleotide identity (97.1–99.7%) with Bat-CoV-JTMC15 reported in China. The other five sequences were most similar to MERS-like betacoronaviruses. Four nucleotide sequences displayed the highest identity (94.1–95.1%) with Bat-CoV-HKU5 from Hong Kong. The one sequence from a carcass showed the highest nucleotide identity (99%) with Bat-CoV-SC2013 from China. These results suggest that careful surveillance of coronaviruses from bats should be continued, because animal and human infections may result from the genetic variants present in bat coronavirus reservoirs.","Lee, Saemi; Jo, Seong-Deok; Son, Kidong; An, Injung; Jeong, Jipseol; Wang, Seung-Jun; Kim, Yongkwan; Jheong, Weonhwa; Oem, Jae-Ku",Microb Ecol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00248-017-1033-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28725945/,110

Tennis is played by 6.2% of the population within the Oceania region, and is a valuable sport for maintaining social, mental, and physical health. Current literature indicates the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the mental health of Australian residents. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in training and match play due to the outbreak, and its effects on emotional well-being of Australian senior tennis players. Additionally, explore any differences between middle aged (41–60 years) and senior (61 years and over) Australian tennis players. An online survey was used to assess training and match play habits, as well as ascertain the emotional well-being of tennis players. The survey was active from 24th April 2020 until 6th June 2020. Participants were adult (41+ years) tennis players from Australia. Wilcoxon signed rank tests were performed to check for differences in training hours and tennis matches played. Mann–Whitney U tests were used to assess the difference in Brief Emotional Experience Scale (BEES) scores, employment status as well as the training hours and tennis matches played between the two age groups. A Kendall's Tau B correlation test was performed to assess the associations of training, match play and demographic characteristics with BEES scores. Kruskal–Wallis tests assessed differences in BEES scores between participants of differing match play formats, tennis experience and cessation of tennis training time periods. There were 245 respondents who met our inclusion criteria. Tennis training hours along with the tennis matches played significantly decreased during COVID-19 compared to pre-COVID-19, 85.09 and 88.48%, respectively. No significant (p > 0.05) differences were observed between age groups for any of the training modality hours, nor was there any significant difference in number of tennis matches played. The participants average BEES score was 0.99 ± 1.27, indicating that respondents had a positive emotional well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. The emotional well-being of the senior group was significantly (P = 0.002) higher than the middle aged group.

609157,Food Insecurity and Health: Practices and Policies to Address Food Insecurity among Children,2020-07-09,"BACKGROUND: Because of the need to limit side-effects, nanoparticles are increasingly being studied as drug-carrying and targeting tools. We have previously reported on a scheme to produce protein-based self-assembling nanoparticles that can act as antigen display platforms. Here we attempted to use the same system for cancer-targeting, making use of a C-terminal bombesin peptide that has high affinity for a receptor known to be overexpressed in certain tumors, as well as an N-terminal polyhistidine tag that can be used for radiolabeling with technetium tricarbonyl. RESULTS: In order to increase circulation time, we experimented with PEGylated and unPEGylated varities typo particle. We also tested the effect of incorporating different numbers of bombesins per nanoparticle. Biophysical characterization determined that all configurations assemble into regular particles with relatively monodisperse size distributions, having peaks of about 33 – 36 nm. The carbonyl method used for labeling produced approximately 80% labeled nanoparticles. In vitro, the nanoparticles showed high binding, both specific and non-specific, to PC-3 prostate cancer cells. In vivo, high uptake was observed for all nanoparticle types in the spleens of CD-1 nu/nu mice, decreasing significantly over the course of 24 hours. High uptake was also observed in the liver, while only low uptake was seen in both the pancreas and a tumor xenograft. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the nanoparticles are non-specifically taken up by the reticuloendothelial system. Low uptake in the pancreas and tumor indicate that there is little or no specific targeting. PEGylation or increasing the amount of bombesins per nanoparticle did not significantly improve targeting. In particular, the uptake in the spleen, which is a primary organ of the immune system, highlights the potential of the nanoparticles as vaccine carriers. Also, the decrease in liver and spleen radioactivity with time implies that the nanoparticles are broken down and cleared. This is an important finding, as it shows that the nanoparticles can be safely used as a vaccine platform without the risk of prolonged side effects. Furthermore, it demonstrates that technetium carbonyl radiolabeling of our protein-based nanoparticles can be used to evaluate their pharmacokinetic properties in vivo.","Yang, Yongkun; Neef, Tobias; Mittelholzer, Christian; Garcia Garayoa, Elisa; Bläuenstein, Peter; Schibli, Roger; Aebi, Ueli; Burkhard, Peter",J Nanobiotechnology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24219600/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1477-3155-11-36,110

This Perspective explores some advantages and disadvantages of “low-dosage” challenge studies, in the setting of testing second-generation vaccines against COVID-19. Compared to a conventional vaccine challenge, a low-dosage vaccine challenge would be likelier to start, and start earlier. A low-dosage challenge would also be less likely to rule out a vaccine candidate which would have been potentially effective in target usage. A key ethical advantage of a low-dosage challenge over conventional challenge is that both it and its dose escalation process are safer for each participant. Low-dosage studies usually require larger numbers of participants than conventional challenges, but this and other potential disadvantages are less serious than they may initially appear.

A Comment on Vavricka and Others v. the Czech Republic,2021,"Phenolic acids represent about one-third of the dietary phenols and are widespread in vegetable and fruits. Several plants belonging to both vegetables and medical herbs have been studied for their hydroxycinnamic acid content. Among them, Echinacea purpurea is preferentially used for caffeic acid-derivatives extraction. The wine industry is a source of by-products that are rich in phenolic compounds. This work demonstrates that unripe grape juice (verjuice) presents a simple high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) profile for hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs), with a great separation of the caffeic-derived acids and a low content of other phenolic compounds when compared to E. purpurea and other grape by-products. Here it is shown how this allows the recovery of pure hydroxycinnamic acids by a simple and fast method, fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). In addition, verjuice can be easily obtained by pressing grape berries and filtering, thus avoiding any extraction step as required for other vegetable sources. Overall, the proposed protocol could strongly reduce the engagement of solvent in industrial phenolic extraction.","Vendramin, Veronica; Viel, Alessia; Vincenzi, Simone",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26041148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33669973/,110

IL-6 inhibitors agents have been used as treatment options for COVID-19, yet their benefit as therapeutic agents remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the available evidence on the potential therapeutic effect of IL-6 inhibitor agents for the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: Two authors initially screened and reviewed the relevant studies from available databases. The data extracted will be tabulated and analyzed for the outcomes. The primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes included discharge from the hospital, length of stay, and requirement for mechanical ventilation. The quality of each study was assessed using OCEBM ratings. RESULTS: We reviewed 18 studies with a total of 3303 subjects. Tocilizumab was the most commonly used in the studies (15 studies). Meta-analysis of included studies revealed significant reduction in mortality with tocilizumab and sarilumab (RR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.49–0.76). Other outcomes including hospital discharge (RR = 1.04, 95% CI 0.86–1.24), length of stay (mean difference –1.96 days, 95% CI –4.24 to 0.33) or requirement for mechanical ventilation (RR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.32–1.45) revealed no differences of IL-6 inhibitor agents compared to controls.

Past work with pandemic outbreaks suggests that media attention can increase anxiety and compensatory behaviors. Social isolation can lead to increase in online communication and parents who use social media may be affected by other people's emotions online through what is known as digital emotion contagion (DEC). The current study aimed to examine the role of DEC in the relationship between stress, concern about COVID-19, parental burnout and emotion regulation (ER). Methods: In April 2020, an online survey was advertised in Social Media Parenting Groups and published on FIU Psychology online research system SONA. Data were analyzed using correlational analysis, linear and multiple linear regression, and moderation analysis. Results: Concern about COVID-19 predicted stress, depression, and parental burnout. Susceptibility to DEC significantly increased the impact of stress on parental burnout. Having relatives infected with COVID-19 increased the effect of DEC on parental burnout. A higher level of ER buffered the relationship between emotion contagion and concern about COVID-19. Conclusion: These findings suggest that susceptibility to digital emotion contagion may have a negative effect on parents. Digital emotion contagion may increase parental burnout and is tied to stress.","Prikhidko, Alena; Long, Haiying; Wheaton, Michael G.",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33392126/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.567250,110

Although public health measures adopted in the country have improved the care, diagnosis and management of patients with tuberculosis, there are still failures in the control of the disease in the country, especially of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and among the prison population or people living with HIV. The COVID-19 pandemic has added a great burden to the Peruvian public health system, negatively impacting tuberculosis-focused health programs due to the diversion of resources to control the pandemic. Consequently, combat measures, epidemiological surveillance of tuberculosis cases were affected, and data point to an increase in the number of cases, especially of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, and to the underdiagnosis of the disease. To deal with this problem and avoid a future catastrophe for the country's health system, multidisciplinary measures involving the population, health professionals and government bodies are needed. It is essential that education, diagnosis, contact screening and treatment programs are prioritised and given greater financial support. Furthermore, it is necessary to raise awareness in the population about the need for isolation and maintenance of treatment, especially among the most vulnerable populations.","Khan, Fatima Muhammad Asad; Kazmi, Zohra; Hasan, Mohammad Mehedi; Dos Santos Costa, Ana Carla; Ahmad, Shoaib; Essar, Mohammad Yasir",The International journal of health planning and management,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34318523/; https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.3291,110

Adverse cardiac effects associated with respiratory infections, more specifically Streptococcus pneumoniae and influenza infections, are the consequence of inflammatory processes and thrombotic events. For both influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations, large multicenter randomized clinical trials are needed to evaluate their efficacy in preventing cardiovascular events, especially in HF patients. No study to date has evaluated the protective effect of the COVID-19 vaccine in patients with HF. Different guidelines recommend annual influenza vaccination for patients with established cardiovascular disease and also recommend pneumococcal vaccination in patients with HF. The Heart Failure group of the French Society of Cardiology recently strongly recommended vaccination against COVID-19 in HF patients. Nevertheless, the implementation of vaccination recommendations against respiratory infections in HF patients remains suboptimal. This suggests that a national health policy is needed to improve vaccination coverage, involving not only the general practitioner, but also other health providers, such as cardiologists, nurses, and pharmacists. This review first summarizes the pathophysiology of the interrelationships between inflammation, infection, and HF. Then, we describe the current clinical knowledge concerning the protective effect of vaccines against respiratory diseases (influenza, pneumococcal infection, and COVID-19) in patients with HF and finally we propose how vaccination coverage could be improved in these patients.","Girerd, Nicolas; Chapet, Nicolas; Roubille, Camille; Roncalli, Jérôme; Salvat, Muriel; Mouquet, Frédéric; Lamblin, Nicolas; Gueffet, Jean-Pierre; Damy, Thibaud; Galinier, Michel; Tartiere, Jean-Michel; Janssen, Cécile; Berthelot, Emmanuelle; Aguilhon, Sylvain; Escamilla, Roger; Roubille, François",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34640328/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10194311,110

622727,Rebuilding active public participation after the COVID‐19 era: The South African case,2021-07-18,"BACKGROUND: Infectious individuals in an emergency department (ED) bring substantial risks of cross infection. Data about the complex social and spatial structure of interpersonal contacts in the ED will aid construction of biologically plausible transmission risk models that can guide cross infection control. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We sought to determine the number and duration of contacts among patients and staff in a large, busy ED. This prospective study was conducted between 1 July 2009 and 30 June 2010. Two 12-hour shifts per week were randomly selected for study. The study was conducted in the ED of an urban hospital. There were 81 shifts in the planned random sample of 104 (78%) with usable contact data, during which there were 9183 patient encounters. Of these, 6062 (66%) were approached to participate, of which 4732 (78%) agreed. Over the course of the year, 88 staff members participated (84%). A radiofrequency identification (RFID) system was installed and the ED divided into 89 distinct zones structured so copresence of two individuals in any zone implied a very high probability of contact <1 meter apart in space. During study observation periods, patients and staff were given RFID tags to wear. Contact events were recorded. These were further broken down with respect to the nature of the contacts, i.e., patient with patient, patient with staff, and staff with staff. 293,171 contact events were recorded, with a median of 22 contact events and 9 contacts with distinct individuals per participant per shift. Staff-staff interactions were more numerous and longer than patient-patient or patient-staff interactions. CONCLUSIONS: We used RFID to quantify contacts between patients and staff in a busy ED. These results are useful for studies of the spread of infections. By understanding contact patterns most important in potential transmission, more effective prevention strategies may be implemented.","Lowery-North, Douglas W.; Hertzberg, Vicki Stover; Elon, Lisa; Cotsonis, George; Hilton, Sarah A.; Vaughns, Christopher F.; Hill, Eric; Shrestha, Alok; Jo, Alexandria; Adams, Nathan",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0070854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23990915/,110
625073,The role of risk communication in public health interventions. An analysis of risk communication for a community quarantine in Germany to curb the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,2021-08-13,"Background: Countries achieving control of COVID-19 after an initial outbreak will continue to face the risk of SARS-CoV-2 resurgence. This study explores surveillance strategies for COVID-19 containment based on polymerase chain reaction tests. Methods: Using a dynamic SEIR-type model to simulate the initial dynamics of a COVID-19 introduction, we investigate COVID-19 surveillance strategies among healthcare workers, hospital patients, and community members. We estimate surveillance sensitivity as the probability of COVID-19 detection using a hypergeometric sampling process. We identify test allocation strategies that maximise the probability of COVID-19 detection across different testing capacities. We use Beijing, China as a case study. Findings: Surveillance subgroups are more sensitive in detecting COVID-19 transmission when they are defined by more COVID-19 specific symptoms. In this study, fever clinics have the highest surveillance sensitivity, followed by respiratory departments. With a daily testing rate of 0.07/1000 residents, via exclusively testing at fever clinic and respiratory departments, there would have been 598 [95% eCI: 35, 2154] and 1373 [95% eCI: 47, 5230] cases in the population by the time of first case detection, respectively. Outbreak detection can occur earlier by including non-syndromic subgroups, such as younger adults in the community, as more testing capacity becomes available. Interpretation: A multi-layer approach that considers both the surveillance sensitivity and administrative constraints can help identify the optimal allocation of testing resources and thus inform COVID-19 surveillance strategies.

626461,Impact of Covid-19 on the urology service in United States: perspectives and strategies to face a Pandemic,2020-07-27,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 and its associated restrictions around in-person gatherings have created unprecedented challenges for religious congregations and those who lead them. While several surveys have attempted to describe how pastors and congregations responded to COVID-19, these provide a relatively thin picture of how COVID-19 is impacting religious life. There is scant qualitative data describing the lived reality of religious leaders and communities during the pandemic. PURPOSE AND METHODS: This paper provides a more detailed look at how pastors and congregations experienced and responded to COVID-19 and its associated restrictions in the early period of the pandemic. To do so, we draw from 26 in-depth interviews with church-appointed United Methodist pastors conducted between June and August 2020. Pastors were asked to describe how their ministry changed as a result of COVID-19 and interviews were analyzed using applied thematic analysis approaches to identify the most common emergent themes. RESULTS: Pastors reported that COVID-19 fundamentally unsettled routine ways of doing ministry. This disruption generated both challenges and opportunities for clergy and their congregations. In the findings, we describe how clergy responded in key areas of ministry–worship and pastoral care–and analyze how the pandemic is (re)shaping the way that clergy understood their role as pastors and envisioned the future of the Church. We argue for the value of examining the pandemic as an “unsettled” cultural period (Swidler 1986) in which religious leaders found creative ways to (re)do ministry in the context of social distancing. Rather than starting from scratch, we found that pastors drew from and modified existing symbolic and practical tools to fit pandemic-related constraints on religious life. Notably, however, we found that “redoing” ministry was easier and more effective in some areas (worship) than others (pastoral care). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The impact of COVID-19 on pastors and congregations is complex and not fully captured by survey research. This study provides a baseline for investigating similarities and differences in the responses of pastors within and across denominations and traditions. It also provides a baseline for assessing whether changes in ministry implemented during the early stages of the pandemic remain in place in the post-COVID world.","Johnston, Erin F.; Eagle, David E.; Headley, Jennifer; Holleman, Anna",Rev Relig Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13644-021-00465-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34393279/,110

Most of these studies compared self-reported substances use before the pandemic and during the pandemic's early stages. This study aims to identify the changes in substance use between the early and later waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey recruited 750 participants (ages 18–65) in two waves: (1) 427 during and following the first lockdown (April-mid-May, 2020); and (2) 323 following the second lockdown (from October to mid-November, 2020). RESULTS: Participants who experienced two lockdowns reported more frequent consumption of all alcoholic beverages and cannabis in the last 30 days than those who experienced one lockdown. After controlling for demographic variables, significant differences were found between participants who experienced one lockdown and those who experienced two lockdowns in the consumption of alcoholic beverages (F(1, 742) = 6.90, p = .01, η(2) = .01).

632674,Coping with COVID-19: medical students as strong and responsible stewards of their education,2021-01-25,"Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK government imposed public health policies in England to reduce social contacts in hopes of curbing virus transmission. We measured contact patterns weekly from March 2020 to March 2021 to estimate the impact of these policies, covering three national lockdowns interspersed by periods of lower restrictions. Methods: Data were collected using online surveys of representative samples of the UK population by age and gender. We calculated the mean daily contacts reported using a (clustered) bootstrap and fitted a censored negative binomial model to estimate age-stratified contact matrices and estimate proportional changes to the basic reproduction number under controlled conditions using the change in contacts as a scaling factor. Results: The survey recorded 101,350 observations from 19,914 participants who reported 466,710 contacts over 53 weeks. Contact patterns changed over time and by participants' age, personal risk factors, and perception of risk. The mean of reported contacts among adults have reduced compared to previous surveys with adults aged 18 to 59 reporting a mean of 2.39 (95% CI 2.20 - 2.60) contacts to 4.93 (95% CI 4.65 - 5.19) contacts, and the mean contacts for school-age children was 3.07 (95% CI 2.89 - 3.27) to 15.11 (95% CI 13.87 - 16.41). The use of face coverings outside the home has remained high since the government mandated use in some settings in July 2020. Conclusions: The CoMix survey provides a unique longitudinal data set for a full year since the first lockdown for use in statistical analyses and mathematical modelling of COVID-19 and other diseases. Recorded contacts reduced dramatically compared to pre-pandemic levels, with changes correlated to government interventions throughout the pandemic. Despite easing of restrictions in the summer of 2020, mean reported contacts only returned to about half of that observed pre-pandemic.","Gimma, A.; Munday, J. D.; Wong, K.

In the U.S., preparations for challenge trials with the novel coronavirus are complete, and in the U.K., challenge trials have recently begun. However, ethical concerns have been raised about the potential for invalid consent or exploitation. These concerns largely reflect worries that challenge trial volunteers may be unusually risk-seeking or too economically vulnerable to refuse the payments these trials provide, rather than being motivated primarily by altruistic goals. We conducted the first large-scale survey of intended human challenge trial volunteers and found that SARS-CoV-2 challenge trial volunteers exhibit high levels of altruistic motivations without any special indication of poor risk perception or economic vulnerability. Findings indicate that challenge trials with the novel coronavirus can attract volunteers with background conditions, attitudes, and motivations that should allay key ethical concerns.","Rose, S.

Therefore, a new incidence function, in which the difference in contact time activity between infected and non-infected individuals is taken into account, is formulated. Equilibrium and stability analyses of the model have been carried out. The model has been extended to include the effect of herd immunity and the analysis showed that the higher the percent reduction [Formula: see text] in the contact-activity time of infected individuals is, the lower the critical vaccination coverage level [Formula: see text] required to eliminate the infection is, and therefore, the lower the infection’s minimum elimination effort is. Another extension of the basic model to include a control strategy based on treating infected individuals at rate α with a maximum capacity treatment [Formula: see text] has been considered. The equilibrium analysis showed the existence of multiple subcritical and supercritical endemic equilibria, while the stability analysis showed that the model exhibits a Hopf bifurcation. Simulations showed that the higher the maximum treatment capacity [Formula: see text] is, the lower the value of the critical reduction in infected individuals’ time activity [Formula: see text] , at which a Hopf bifurcation is generated, is.

Three patient groups are considered: (1) cancer patients; (2) hematopoietic or solid organ transplantation recipients; and (3) patients with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions requiring therapies that alter the host immune response. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical presentations, associated neuroimaging, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) abnormalities differ between immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. Infections can trigger the emergence of neurotropic antibodies or inflammatory conditions due to treatment with cancer immunotherapies. Unbiased metagenomic assays to identify obscure pathogens help clinicians navigate the increasing range of conditions affecting the growing population of patients with altered immunity.

Criteria and fundamentals for the organization of work,2020-10-19,"Symptoms of takotsubo syndrome (TTS) include acute and transient regional systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle, as well as a variety of wall-motion abnormalities. The clinical features of TTS, including initial symptoms, cardiac biomarkers, and electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, are similar to those of acute coronary syndrome, with the exception that TTS patients typically have no obstructive coronary artery disease. TTS primarily affects elderly women, and emotional or physical stress is a common cause of the disease. Exaggerated sympathetic stimulation associated with dysfunction of the limbic system has also been reported to be related to TTS occurrence. Cancer also induces emotional and physical stress. Therefore, optimization of TTS care should involve cardiac, neurological, psychiatric, and oncological approaches. The first step in optimizing TTS care is to diagnose it by cardiac means. Multimodality imaging, including ECG, echocardiogram, angiography, ventriculography, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, is indispensable for diagnosis, therapy management, and the evaluation of prognosis in the acute and chronic phases of TTS. The current cardiac approach during the acute phase is primarily supportive, with the goal of preventing life-threatening complications. As central nervous system diseases frequently trigger TTS, a neurological approach is also required. Appropriate psychiatric medication may reduce the risk of TTS recurrence, as not only psychiatric disorders themselves but also psychiatric medications can be the trigger for TTS. Several conditions are associated with TTS, including the novel coronavirus disease 2019. We present current knowledge of TTS in this review and describe how to optimize TTS care through a multidisciplinary approach.","Kinno, Ryuta; Ono, Kenjiro",J Multidiscip Healthc,https://doi.org/10.2147/jmdh.s283667; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34531661/,110

637428,Virtual Health Assessment Class Using an Inflatable Manikin.,2020-11-05,"[Image: see text] As corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly growing public health crisis across the world, our knowledge of meaningful diagnostic tests and treatment for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) is still evolving. This novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 can be diagnosed using RT-PCR, but inadequate access to reagents, equipment, and a nonspecific target has slowed disease detection and management. Precision medicine, individualized patient care, requires suitable diagnostics approaches to tackle the challenging aspects of viral outbreaks where many tests are needed in a rapid and deployable approach. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based technologies such as proteomics, glycomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics have been applied in disease outbreaks for identification of infectious disease agents such as virus and bacteria and the molecular phenomena associated with pathogenesis. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) is widely used in clinical diagnostics in the United States and Europe for bacterial pathogen identification. Paper spray ionization mass spectrometry (PSI-MS), a rapid ambient MS technique, has recently open a new opportunity for future clinical investigation to diagnose pathogens. Ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC–HRMS)-based metabolomics and lipidomics have been employed in large-scale biomedical research to discriminate infectious pathogens and uncover biomarkers associated with pathogenesis. PCR-MS has emerged as a new technology with the capability to directly identify known pathogens from the clinical specimens and the potential to identify genetic evidence of undiscovered pathogens. Moreover, miniaturized MS offers possible applications with relatively fast, highly sensitive, and potentially portable ways to analyze for viral compounds. However, beneficial aspects of these rapidly growing MS technologies in pandemics like COVID-19 outbreaks has been limited. Hence, this perspective gives a brief of the existing knowledge, current challenges, and opportunities for MS-based techniques as a promising avenue in studying emerging pathogen outbreaks such as COVID-19.","Mahmud, Iqbal; Garrett, Timothy J.",J Am Soc Mass Spectrom,https://doi.org/10.1021/jasms.0c00238; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32880453/,110

To determine this, we used the existing polio environment surveillance network in Pakistan to investigate presence of SARs-CoV-2 using three commercially available kits and E-Gene detection published assay for surety and confirmatory of positivity. A Two-phase separation method is used for sample clarification and concentration. Before proceeding directly for RNA extraction, an additional high-speed centrifugation (14000Xg for 30 min) step was introduced to increase viral RNA yield resulting decrease in Cq value. A total of 78 wastewater samples collected from 38 districts across Pakistan, 74 wastewater samples from existing polio environment surveillance sites, 3 from drains of COVID-19 infected areas and 1 from COVID 19 quarantine center drainage, were tested for presence of SARs-CoV-2. 21 wastewater samples (27%) from 13 districts turned to be positive on RT-qPCR. SARs-COV-2 RNA positive samples from areas with COVID patients and COVID 19 patient quarantine center drainage strengthen the findings and use of wastewater surveillance in future. Furthermore, sequence data of partial ORF 1a generated from COVID 19 patient quarantine center drainage sample also reinforce our findings that SARs-CoV-2 can be detected in wastewater. This study finding indicates that SARs-CoV-2 detection through wastewater surveillance has an epidemiologic potential that can be used as early warning system to monitor viral tracking and circulation in cities with lower COVID-19 disease burden or heavily populated areas where door-to-door tracing may not be possible. However, attention needed on virus concentration and detection assay to increase the sensitivity. Development of highly sensitive assay will be an indicator for virus monitoring and to provide early warning signs.","Sharif, S.; Ikram, A.; Khurshid, A.; Salman, M.; Mehmood, N.; Arshad, Y.; Ahmad, J.; Angez, M.; Alam, M.

Our objective was to assess the presence of chemokines, cytokines and biomarkers (CCBMs) in saliva from these children that were associated with lymphocyte and mononuclear cell functions. METHODS: Saliva was collected from 11 children diagnosed with SS prior to age 18 years and 16 normal healthy children. A total of 105 CCBMs were detected in multiplex microparticle-based immunoassays. ANOVA and t test (0.05 level) were used to detect differences. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to assess whether elevated CCBMs were in annotations associated with immune system diseases and select leukocyte activities and functions. Machine learning methods were used to evaluate the predictive power of these CCBMs for SS and were measured by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under curve (AUC). RESULTS: Of the 105 CCBMs detected, 43 (40.9%) differed in children with SS from those in healthy study controls (P < 0.05) and could differentiate the two groups (P < 0.05). Elevated CCBMs in IPA annotations were associated with autoimmune diseases and with leukocyte chemotaxis, migration, proliferation, and regulation of T cell activation. The best AUC value in ROC analysis was 0.93, indicating that there are small numbers of CCBMs that may be useful for diagnosis of SS. CONCLUSION: While 35 of these 43 CCBMs have been previously reported in SS, 8 CCBMs had not. Additional studies focusing on these CCBMs may provide further insight into disease pathogenesis and may contribute to diagnosis of SS in children.","Gomez Hernandez, M Paula; Starman, Emily E; Davis, Andrew B; Withanage, Miyuraj Harishchandra Hikkaduwa; Zeng, Erliang; Lieberman, Scott M; Brogden, Kim A; Lanzel, Emily A",Rheumatology (Oxford),https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/keab098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33512494/,110

In March 2020, the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) started implementing public health measures across Kinshasa, including strict lockdown measures in the Gombe health zone. METHODS: Using monthly time series data from the DRC Health Management Information System (January 2018 to December 2020) and interrupted time series with mixed effects segmented Poisson regression models, we evaluated the impact of the pandemic on the use of essential health services (outpatient visits, maternal health, vaccinations, visits for common infectious diseases and non-communicable diseases) during the first wave of the pandemic in Kinshasa. Analyses were stratified by age, sex, health facility and lockdown policy (ie, Gombe vs other health zones). RESULTS: Health service use dropped rapidly following the start of the pandemic and ranged from 16% for visits for hypertension to 39% for visits for diabetes. However, reductions were highly concentrated in Gombe (81% decline in outpatient visits) relative to other health zones. When the lockdown was lifted, total visits and visits for infectious diseases and non-communicable diseases increased approximately twofold. Hospitals were more affected than health centres. Overall, the use of maternal health services and vaccinations was not significantly affected. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in important reductions in health service utilisation in Kinshasa, particularly Gombe. Lifting of lockdown led to a rebound in the level of health service use but it remained lower than prepandemic levels.","Hategeka, Celestin; Carter, Simone E; Chenge, Faustin Mukalenge; Katanga, Eric Nyambu; Lurton, Grégoire; Mayaka, Serge Ma-Nitu; Mwamba, Dieudonné Kazadi; van Kleef, Esther; Vanlerberghe, Veerle; Grépin, Karen Ann",BMJ Glob Health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2021-005955; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34315776/,110

Diagnostic tests for covid-19 fall into two main categories: molecular tests that detect viral RNA, and serological tests that detect anti-SARS-CoV-2immunoglobulins. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a molecular test, has become the gold standard for diagnosis of covid-19; however, this test has many limitations that include potential false negative results, changes in diagnostic accuracy over the disease course, and precarious availability of test materials. Serological tests have generated substantial interest as an alternative or complement to RT-PCR and other Nucleic acid tests in the diagnosis of acute infection, as some might be cheaper and easier to implement at the point of care. A clear advantage of these tests over RT-PCR is that they can identify individuals previously infected by SARS-CoV-2, even if they never underwent testing while acutely ill. Many serological tests for covid-19 have become available in a short period, including some marketed for use as rapid, point-of-care tests.

Five of six CDV infected giant pandas died. The surviving giant panda was previously vaccinated against CDV. Genomic sequencing of CDV isolated from one of the infected pandas (giant panda/SX/2014) suggests it belongs to the Asia-1 cluster. The hemagglutinin protein of the isolated virus and virus sequenced from lung samples originating from deceased giant pandas all possessed the substitutions V26M, T213A, K281R, S300N, P340Q, and Y549H. The presence of the Y549H substitution is notable as it is found at the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) receptor-binding site and has been implicated in the emergence of highly pathogenic CDV and host switching. These findings demonstrate that giant pandas are susceptible to CDV and suggest that surveillance and vaccination among all captive giant pandas are warranted to support conservation efforts for this endangered species.","Feng, Na; Yu, Yicong; Wang, Tiecheng; Wilker, Peter; Wang, Jianzhong; Li, Yuanguo; Sun, Zhe; Gao, Yuwei; Xia, Xianzhu",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27310722/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep27518,110

In India, the countrywide lockdown has been imposed since 24th march 2020, and has got multiple extensions with different guidelines for each phase. Among various models of epidemiology, we use the SIR(D) model to analyze the extent to which this multi-phased lockdown has been active in ‘flattening the curve’ and lower the threat. Analyzing the effect of lockdown on the infection may provide a better insight into the evolution of epidemic while implementing the quarantine procedures as well as improving the healthcare facilities. For accurate modelling, incorporating various parameters along with sophisticated computational facilities are required. Parallel to SIRD modelling, we tend to compare it with the Ising model and derive a quantum circuit that incorporates the rate of infection and rate of recovery, etc as its parameters. The probabilistic plots obtained from the circuit qualitatively resemble the shape of the curve for the spread of Coronavirus. We also demonstrate how the curve flattens when the lockdown is imposed.

The impact of stay-at-home restrictions on physical activity routines in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-02-03,"OBJECTIVE: During December 2020, a massive vaccination program was introduced in our country. The Pfizer-BioNTech, BNT162b2 vaccine was first offered exclusively to high-risk population, such as medical personnel (including pregnant women). In this study we compare short term outcomes in vaccinated vs. non-vaccinated pregnant women. METHODS: In this prospective observational cohort study, vaccinated and non-vaccinated pregnant women were recruited using an online Google forms questionnaire targeting medical groups on Facebook and WhatsApp. A second questionnaire was sent one month after the first one for interim analysis. Our primary outcome was composite complications in vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups, considered any of the following: vaginal bleeding, pregnancy loss, hypertension, gestational diabetes, and preterm birth. Secondary outcomes included: vaccine side effects, diagnosis of COVID-19 since the last questionnaire, prevalence of vaccinated participants, and reasons for refusal to be vaccinated. RESULTS: Overall, 432 women answered the first questionnaire, of which 326 responses were received to the second questionnaire. Vaccination rate increased from 25.5% to 62% within a month. Maternal age, gestational age at enrollment, nulliparity and number of children were similar in both groups. The rate of composite pregnancy complications was similar between vaccinated and non-vaccinated group (15.8% vs 20.1%, p = 0.37), respectively. The risk for COVID-19 infection was significantly lower in the vaccinated group (1.5% vs 6.5%, p = 0.024, Odds Ratio: 4.5, 95% confidence interval 1.19–17.6).

646386,Telecommuting during the coronavirus pandemic: Future time orientation as a mediator between proactive coping and perceived work productivity in two cultural samples,2020-11-07,"Enteric viruses are a diverse group of human pathogens which are primarily transmitted by the faecal–oral route and are a major cause of non-bacterial diarrhoeal disease in both developed and developing countries. Because they are shed in high numbers by infected individuals and can persist for a long time in the environment, they pose a serious threat to human health globally. Enteric viruses end up in the environment mainly through discharge or leakage of raw or inadequately treated sewage into water sources such as springs, rivers, dams, or marine estuaries. Human exposure then follows when contaminated water is used for drinking, cooking, or recreation and, importantly, when filter-feeding bivalve shellfish are consumed. The human health hazard posed by enteric viruses is particularly serious in Africa where rapid urbanisation in a relatively short period of time has led to the expansion of informal settlements with poor sanitation and failing or non-existent wastewater treatment infrastructure, and where rural communities with limited or no access to municipal water are dependent on nearby open water sources for their subsistence. The role of sewage-contaminated water and bivalve shellfish as vehicles for transmission of enteric viruses is well documented but, to our knowledge, has not been comprehensively reviewed in the African context.

646467,Empirical assessment of government policies and flattening of the COVID19 curve,2020-08-27,"COVID-19 epidemics have varied dramatically in nature across the United States, where some counties have clear peaks in infections, and others have had a multitude of unpredictable and non-distinct peaks. Our lack of understanding of how the pandemic has evolved leads to increasing errors in our ability to predict the spread of the disease. This work seeks to explain this diversity in epidemic progressions by considering an extension to the compartmental SEIRD model. The model we propose uses a neural network to predict the infection rate as a function of both time and the disease’s prevalence. We provide a methodology for fitting this model to available county-level data describing aggregate cases and deaths. Our method uses Expectation-Maximization to overcome the challenge of partial observability, due to the fact that the system’s state is only partially reflected in available data. We fit a single model to data from multiple counties in the United States exhibiting different behavior. By simulating the model, we show that it can exhibit both single peak and multi-peak behavior, reproducing behavior observed in counties both in and out of the training set. We then compare the error of simulations from our model with a standard SEIRD model, and show that ours substantially reduces errors. We also use simulated data to compare our methodology for handling partial observability with a standard approach, showing that ours is significantly better at estimating the values of unobserved quantities.","Menda, Kunal; Laird, Lucas; Kochenderfer, Mykel J.; Caceres, Rajmonda S.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34504171/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-97260-0,110

646836,A Self-Determination Theory Approach to Work Motivation of Autistic Adults: A Qualitative Exploratory Study,2021-07-14,"INTRODUCTION: Poland was initially less affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, however, severe restrictions, and health care restructuration have impacted all areas of medicine, including urology. Therefore, we aimed, via an online survey, to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Polish urologists and urology residents. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between May 15 and June 6, 2020, 229 (28.63% response rate) urologists and urology residents responded to a 28-question online survey. The questionnaire analyzed basic demographic and professional characteristics, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physicians' everyday work, mental status as well as private life. We further compared the differences between the selected subgroups. RESULTS: Nearly all (96.5%) responders claimed that the pandemic had a moderate to high impact on their everyday clinical practice with the majority of the residents (62.0%) believing that the COVID-19 pandemic will harm their training. Most responders (86.9%) reported over 25% declines in outpatient clinic consultations and 55.9% claimed that their income dropped over 25%. Only 38.9% wanted telemedicine to permanently replace some of the consultations after the pandemic, with residents being significantly more positive about this modality (51.4% vs. 33.1%; p = 0.01). Interestingly, 79.9% noticed the negative psychological effect of the pandemic on their colleagues, and 57.6% felt increased anxiety, sadness, or stress. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the complaints and needs of Polish urologists and urology residents after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a significantly negative impact on their work, mental health, and private life.","Rajwa, Pawel; Przydacz, Mikołaj; Zapała, Piotr; Wieckiewicz, Gniewko; Ryszawy, Jakub; Chorągwicki, Dominik; Drobot, Rafał B.; Radziszewski, Piotr; Paradysz, Andrzej; Chłosta, Piotr L.",Cent European J Urol,https://doi.org/10.5173/ceju.2020.0252; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33133649/,110

The gut microbiome has a profound impact on gastrointestinal tract development, maintenance of mucosal surface integrity, and contributes to the nutritional status of the host and thus plays a pivotal role in health and disease. New technologies have enabled the detailed characterization of normal microbial symbionts and dysbiosis–disease associations. This review summarizes the stepwise establishment of the intestinal microbiota, influential environmental factors, and how this may be perturbed in preterm very-low-birth-weight infants. The contribution of the microbiota to provision of energy and nutrients for intestinal development and the nutritional status of the host are reviewed. In addition, the crucial role of the gut microbiota in maintaining mucosal integrity is explored along with how its breakdown can lead to sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Finally, the role of enteral feeding type (human milk, formula, and nutrient fortification) in mediating these processes is discussed, and guidance is provided for nutritional strategies to promote health in these fragile infants.

However, the financial and social impacts of these restrictions can negatively affect parents’ and children’s mental health. In an existing cohort of mothers recruited for their experience of adversity, this study examined: 1) families’ experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic and public health restrictions in terms of clinical exposure, financial hardship family stress, and family resilience (termed ‘COVID-19 impacts’); and 2) associations between COVID-19 impacts and maternal and child mental health. METHODS: Participants were mothers recruited during pregnancy (2013–14) across two Australian states (Victoria and Tasmania) for the ‘right@home’ trial. A COVID-19 survey was conducted from May-December 2020, when children were 5.9–7.2 years old. Mothers reported COVID-19 impacts, their own mental health (Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales short-form) and their child’s mental health (CoRonavIruS Health and Impact Survey subscale). Associations between COVID-19 impacts and mental health were examined using regression models controlling for pre-COVID-19 characteristics. RESULTS: 319/406 (79%) mothers completed the COVID-19 survey. Only one reported having had COVID-19. Rates of self-quarantine (20%), job or income loss (27%) and family stress (e.g., difficulty managing children’s at-home learning (40%)) were high. Many mothers also reported family resilience (e.g., family found good ways of coping (49%)). COVID-19 impacts associated with poorer mental health (standardised coefficients) included self-quarantine (mother: β = 0.46, child: β = 0.46), financial hardship (mother: β = 0.27, child: β = 0.37) and family stress (mother: β = 0.49, child: β = 0.74). Family resilience was associated with better mental health (mother: β = -0.40, child: β = -0.46). CONCLUSIONS: The financial and social impacts of Australia’s public health restrictions have substantially affected families experiencing adversity, and their mental health. These impacts are likely to exacerbate inequities arising from adversity. To recover from COVID-19, policy investment should include income support and universal access to family health services.","Bryson, Hannah; Mensah, Fiona; Price, Anna; Gold, Lisa; Mudiyanselage, Shalika Bohingamu; Kenny, Bridget; Dakin, Penelope; Bruce, Tracey; Noble, Kristy; Kemp, Lynn; Goldfeld, Sharon",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257357; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34516564/,110
647878,‘Covido-dontics’ to Confront the ‘Covidi-fied’ Dental Education,2020,"Background. Health disparities have emerged with the COVID-19 epidemic because the risk of exposure to infection and the prevalence of risk factors for severe outcomes given infection vary within and between populations. However, estimated epidemic quantities such as rates of severe illness and death, the case fatality rate (CFR), and infection fatality rate (IFR), are often expressed in terms of aggregated population-level estimates due to the lack of epidemiological data at the refined subpopulation level. For public health policy makers to better address the pandemic, stratified estimates are necessary to investigate the potential outcomes of policy scenarios targeting specific subpopulations. Methods. We develop a framework for using available data on the prevalence of COVID-19 risk factors (age, comorbidities, BMI, smoking status) in subpopulations, and epidemic dynamics at the population level and stratified by age, to estimate subpopulation-stratified probabilities of severe illness and the CFR (as deaths over observed infections) and IFR (as deaths over estimated total infections) across risk profiles representing all combinations of risk factors including age, comorbidities, obesity class, and smoking status. A dynamic epidemic model is integrated with a relative risk model to produce time-varying subpopulation-stratified estimates. The integrated model is used to analyze dynamic outcomes and parameters by population and subpopulation, and to simulate alternate policy scenarios that protect specific at-risk subpopulations or modify the population-wide transmission rate. The model is calibrated to data from the Los Angeles County population during the period March 1 - October 15 2020. Findings. We estimate a rate of 0.23 (95% CI: 0.13,0.33) of infections observed before April 15, which increased over the epidemic course to 0.41 (0.11,0.69). Overall population-average IFR(t) estimates for LAC peaked at 0.77% (0.38%,1.15%) on May 15 and decreased to 0.55% (0.24%,0.90%) by October 15. The population-average IFR(t) stratified by age group varied extensively across subprofiles representing each combination of the additional risk factors considered (comorbidities, BMI, smoking). We found median IFRs ranging from 0.009%-0.04% in the youngest age group (0-19), from 0.1%-1.8% for those aged 20-44, 0.36%-4.3% for those aged 45-64, and 1.02%-5.42% for those aged 65+. In the group aged 65+ for which the rate of unobserved infections is likely much lower, we find median CFRs in the range 4.4%-23.45%. The initial societal lockdown period avoided overwhelming healthcare capacity and greatly reduced the observed death count. In comparative scenario analysis, alternative policies in which the population-wide transmission rate is reduced to a moderate and sustainable level of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) would not have been sufficient to avoid overwhelming healthcare capacity, and additionally would have exceeded the observed death count. Combining the moderate NPI policy with stringent protection of the at-risk subpopulation of individuals 65+ would have resulted in a death count similar to observed levels, but hospital counts would have approached capacity limits. Interpretation. The risk of severe illness and death of COVID-19 varies tremendously across subpopulations and over time, suggesting that it is inappropriate to summarize epidemiological parameters for the entire population and epidemic time period. This includes variation not only across age groups, but also within age categories combined with other risk factors analyzed in this study (comorbidities, obesity status, smoking). In the policy analysis accounting for differences in IFR across risk groups in comparing the control of infections and protection of higher risk groups, we find that the strict initial lockdown period in LAC was effective because it both reduced overall transmission and protected individuals at greater risk, resulting in preventing both healthcare overload and deaths. While similar numbers of deaths as observed in LAC could have been achieved with a more moderate NPI policy combined with greater protection of individuals 65+, this would have come at the expense of overwhelming the healthcare system. In anticipation of a continued rise in cases in LAC this winter, policy makers need to consider the trade offs of various policy options on the numbers of the overall population that may become infected, severely ill, and that die when considering policies targeted at subpopulations at greatest risk of transmitting infection and at greatest risk for developing severe outcomes.","Horn, A.

648223,A Decision Analytic Approach for Social Distancing Policies During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-06-26,"SARS-CoV-2 has become a pandemic causing a serious global health concern. The absence of effective drugs for treatment of the disease has caused its rapid spread on a global scale. Similarly to the SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 is also involved in a complex interplay with the host cells. This infection is characterized by a diffused alveolar damage consistent with the Acute Respiratory Disease Syndrome (ARDS). To explore the complex mechanisms of the disease at the system level, we used a network medicine tools approach. The protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between the SARS-CoV and the associated human cell proteins are crucial for the viral pathogenesis. Since the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 is accomplished by binding of the spike glycoprotein binding domain (RBD) to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), a molecule that can bind to the spike RDB-hACE2 interface could block the virus entry. Here, we performed a virtual screening of 55 compounds to identify potential molecules that can bind to the spike glycoprotein and spike-ACE2 complex interface. It was found that the compound ethyl 1-{3-[(2,4-dichlorobenzyl) carbamoyl]-1-ethyl-6-fluoro-4-oxo-1,4-dihydro-7-quinolinyl}-4-piperidine carboxylate (the S54 ligand) and ethyl 1-{3-[(2,4-dichlorobenzyl) carbamoyl]-1-ethyl-6-fluoro-4-oxo-1,4-dihydro-7-quinolinyl}-4 piperazine carboxylate (the S55 ligand) forms hydrophobic interactions with Tyr41A, Tyr505B and Tyr553B, Leu29A, Phe495B, respectively of the spike glycoprotein, the hotspot residues in the spike glycoprotein RBD-hACE2 binding interface. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations using the MM-GBSA method showed that the S54 ligand is a stronger binder than a known SARS-CoV spike inhibitor SSAA09E3 (N-(9,10-dioxo-9, 10-dihydroanthracen-2-yl) benzamide).

Le but de ces recommandations établies par le Comité de Nutrition à Domicile de la Société Francophone de Nutrition Clinique et Métabolisme est, d’une part, de préciser la prise en charge minimale de ces patients, tant en termes de suivi que de matériels, mais surtout de s’adapter aux tensions actuelles relatives aux personnes et aux matériels, afin de poursuivre une prise en charge de qualité et de ne pas compromettre l’état de santé des patients en nutrition artificielle à domicile pendant la crise. Abstract Home artificial nutrition, whether enteral or parenteral, is provided to chronic and fragile patients. The current COVID-19 epidemics may compromise their care at several levels: difficulties to access to hospitals mainly focused on treating COVID-19 patients, possible lack of nurses at home, strong reduction of visits by homecare providers, tended flow or lack of hand sanitizers, surgical masks and pumps.

650217,Differential Patterns of Social Media Use Associated with Loneliness and Health Outcomes in Selected Socioeconomic Groups,2021-05-14,"Controlling the regional re-emergence of SARS-CoV-2 after its initial spread in ever-changing personal contact networks and disease landscapes is a challenging task. In a landscape context, contact opportunities within and between populations are changing rapidly as lockdown measures are relaxed and a number of social activities re-activated. Using an individual-based metapopulation model, we explored the efficacy of different control strategies across an urban-rural gradient in Wales, UK. Our model shows that isolation of symptomatic cases, or regional lockdowns in response to local outbreaks, have limited efficacy unless the overall transmission rate is kept persistently low. Additional isolation of non-symptomatic infected individuals, who may be detected by effective test and trace strategies, is pivotal to reduce the overall epidemic size over a wider range of transmission scenarios. We define an urban-rural gradient in epidemic size as a correlation between regional epidemic size and connectivity within the region, with more highly connected urban populations experiencing relatively larger outbreaks. For interventions focused on regional lockdowns, the strength of such gradients in epidemic size increased with higher travel frequencies, indicating a reduced efficacy of the control measure in the urban regions under these conditions. When both non-symptomatic and symptomatic individuals are isolated or regional lockdown strategies are enforced, we further found the strongest urban-rural epidemic gradients at high transmission rates. This effect was reversed for strategies targeted at symptomatics only. Our results emphasise the importance of test-and-tracing strategies and maintaining low transmission rates for efficiently controlling COVID19 spread, both at landscape scale and in urban areas.","Wells, K.; Lurgi, M.; Collins, B.; Lucini, B.; Kao, R.

650675,Introducing a comprehensive high-stake online exam to final-year dental students during the COVID-19 pandemic and evaluation of its effectiveness,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND: It was shown that immunocompromised patients have significantly reduced immunologic responses to COVID-19 vaccines. The immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccine/infection in patients with solid tumors is reduced. We evaluated the immunologic response to COVID-19 and/or the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine among cancer patients on active treatments and reviewed previous literature to identify subgroups that may require third vaccination. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 antibodies were measured in a cohort of 202 cancer patients on active treatment with chemotherapy (96), immunologic (52), biologic (46), and hormonal (12) treatments for early (n=66, 32.7%) or metastatic disease (n=136, 67.3%). Of those, 172 had received two vaccine doses, and 30 had COVID-19 infection (20/30 also received one dose of vaccine). Specific anti–S receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibodies were further measured in patients with equivocal anti S1/S2 results. RESULTS: Among cancer patients, the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response rate was 89.1% (180/202) after COVID-19 vaccination or infection and 87.2% (150/172) in patients after vaccination without a history of COVID-19, compared with 100% positive serologic tests in a control group of 30 healthcare workers (p<0.001). Chemotherapy treatment was independently associated with significantly reduced humoral response to infection or vaccination, with an 81.3% response rate, compared with 96.2% in patients on other treatments (p=0.001). In vaccinated patients on chemotherapy, the positive response rate was 77.5%. In a multiple regression model, a neutralizing antibody titer (>60 AU/ml) was more likely with immunotherapy (odds ratio 2.44) and less likely with chemotherapy (odds ratio 0.39). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, both COVID-19 vaccine and natural infection are highly immunogenic among cancer patients. However, our study identifies those under chemotherapy as significantly less responsive, and with lower antibody levels. These findings justify close virological and serological surveillance along with consideration of these patients for booster (3rd dose) vaccine prioritization, as new highly spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge.","Grinshpun, Albert; Rottenberg, Yakir; Ben-Dov, Iddo Z.; Djian, Esther; Wolf, Dana G.; Kadouri, Luna",ESMO Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34634634/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2059702921002453; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2021.100283; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2059702921002453?v=s5,110

651654,Unprecedented environmental and energy impacts and challenges of COVID-19 pandemic,2020-11-07,"Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) is a major contributor to seasonal outbreaks of acute respiratory illness (ARI). The origins of locally circulating HCoV-OC43 strains and characteristics of their genetic diversity are unknown for most settings despite significance to effective HCoV control strategies. Between December 2015 and June 2016, we undertook ARI surveillance in coastal Kenya in nine outpatients and one inpatient health facility (HF). Ninety-two patient samples tested HCoV-OC43 positive and forty (43.5%) were successfully sequenced in spike (S) gene region (2,864 long, ∼70%). Phylogenetic analysis confirmed co-circulation of two distinct HCoV-OC43 clades that closely clustered with genotype G (n = 34, 85%) and genotype H (n = 6, 15%) reference strains. Local viruses within the same clade displayed low genetic diversity yielding identical sequences in multiple HF. Furthermore, the newly sequenced Kenyan viruses showed close phylogenetic relationship to other contemporaneous sampled strains (2015–16) including those originating from distant places (e.g. USA and China). Using a genetic similarity threshold of 99.1 per cent at nucleotide level, the HCoV-OC43 strains sampled globally between 1967 and 2019 fell into nine sequence clusters. Notably, some of these clusters appeared to have become extinct, or occurred only sporadically in a few geographical areas while others persisted globally for multiple years. In conclusion, we found that HCoV-OC43 strains spread rapidly both locally and across the globe with limited genetic evolution in the spike gene. Full-genome sequences that are spatio-temporally representative are required to advance understanding of the transmission pathways of this important human respiratory pathogen.","Abidha, Carol A; Nyiro, Joyce; Kamau, Everlyn; Abdullahi, Osman; Nokes, David James; Agoti, Charles N",Virus Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32523779/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/veaa031,110

LSECs are characterized with numerous fenestrae and lack basement membrane as well as a diaphragm. These unique morphological characteristics of LSECs makes them the most permeable endothelial cells of the mammalian vasculature and aid in regulating flow of macromolecules and small lipid-based structures between sinusoidal blood and parenchymal cells. LSECs have a very high endocytic capacity aided by scavenger receptors (SR), such as SR-A, SR-B (SR-B1 and CD-36), SR-E (Lox-1 and mannose receptors), and SR-H (Stabilins). Other high-affinity receptors for mediating endocytosis include the FcγRIIb, which assist in the antibody-mediated removal of immune complexes. Complemented with intense lysosomal activity, LSECs play a vital role in the uptake and degradation of many blood borne waste macromolecules and small (<280 nm) colloids. Currently, seven Toll-like receptors have been investigated in LSECs, which are involved in the recognition and clearance of pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMPs) as well as damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP). Along with other SRs, LSECs play an essential role in maintaining lipid homeostasis with the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1), in juxtaposition with hepatocytes. LSECs co-express two surface lectins called L-Specific Intercellular adhesion molecule-3 Grabbing Non-integrin Receptor (L-SIGN) and liver sinusoidal endothelial cell lectin (LSECtin). LSECs also express several adhesion molecules which are involved in the recruitment of leukocytes at the site of inflammation. Here, we review these cell surface receptors as well as other components expressed by LSECs and their functions in the maintenance of liver homeostasis. We further discuss receptor expression and activity and dysregulation associated with the initiation and progression of many liver diseases, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, liver fibrosis, and cirrhosis, alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases and pseudocapillarization with aging.","Pandey, Ekta; Nour, Aiah S.; Harris, Edward N.",Front Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32848838/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2020.00873,110

654205,Exploring the association between compliance with measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and big five traits with Bayesian generalized linear model,2021-02-23,"Rabies remains a major public health concern in many developing countries. The precise neuropathogenesis of rabies is unknown, though it is hypothesized to be due to neuronal death or dysfunction. Mice that received intranasal inoculation of an attenuated rabies virus (RABV) strain HEP-Flury exhibited subtle clinical signs, and eventually recovered, which is different from the fatal encephalitis caused by the virulent RABV strain CVS-11. To understand the neuropathogenesis of rabies and the mechanisms of viral clearance, we applied RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to compare the brain transcriptomes of normal mice vs. HEP-Flury or CVS-11 intranasally inoculated mice. Our results revealed that both RABV strains altered positively and negatively the expression levels of many host genes, including genes associated with innate and adaptive immunity, inflammation and cell death. It is found that HEP-Flury infection can activate the innate immunity earlier through the RIG-I/MDA-5 signaling, and the innate immunity pre-activated by HEP-Flury or Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection can effectively prevent the CVS-11 to invade central nervous system (CNS), but fails to clear the CVS-11 after its entry into the CNS. In addition, following CVS-11 infection, genes implicated in cell adhesion, blood vessel morphogenesis and coagulation were mainly up-regulated, while the genes involved in synaptic transmission and ion transport were significantly down-regulated. On the other hand, several genes involved in the MHC class II-mediated antigen presentation pathway were activated to a greater extent after the HEP-Flury infection as compared with the CVS-11 infection suggesting that the collaboration of CD4(+) T cells and MHC class II-mediated antigen presentation is critical for the clearance of attenuated RABV from the CNS. The differentially regulated genes reported here are likely to include potential therapeutic targets for expanding the post-exposure treatment window for RABV infection.","Zhang, Daiting; He, Feilong; Bi, Shuilian; Guo, Huixia; Zhang, Baoshi; Wu, Fan; Liang, Jiaqi; Yang, Youtian; Tian, Qin; Ju, Chunmei; Fan, Huiying; Chen, Jinding; Guo, Xiaofeng; Luo, Yongwen",Front Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00751; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27242764/,110

Methods Human intestinal biopsy tissues were obtained from COVID-19 patients (n=19) and uninfected controls (n=10) for microscopic examination, CyTOF analyses and RNA sequencing. Additionally, disease severity and mortality were examined in patients with and without GI symptoms in two large, independent cohorts of hospitalized patients in the United States (n=634) and Europe (n=287) using multivariate logistic regressions. Results COVID-19 cases and controls in the biopsy cohort were comparable for age, gender, rates of hospitalization and relevant comorbid conditions. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in small intestinal epithelial cells by immunofluorescence staining or electron microscopy, in 14 of 16 patients studied. High dimensional analyses of GI tissues revealed low levels of inflammation, including downregulation of key inflammatory genes including IFNG, CXCL8, CXCL2 and IL1B and reduced frequencies of proinflammatory dendritic cells compared with controls. Consistent with these findings, we found a significant reduction in disease severity and mortality in patients presenting with GI symptoms that was independent of gender, age, and comorbid illnesses and despite similar nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral loads. Furthermore, there was reduced levels of key inflammatory proteins in circulation in patients with GI symptoms. Conclusion These data highlight the absence of a proinflammatory response in the GI tract despite detection of SARS-CoV-2. In parallel, reduced mortality in COVID-19 patients presenting with GI symptoms was observed. A potential role of the GI tract in attenuating SARS-CoV-2 associated inflammation needs to be further examined.","Livanos, Alexandra E.; Jha, Divya; Cossarini, Francesca; Gonzalez-Reiche, Ana S.; Tokuyama, Minami; Aydillo, Teresa; Parigi, Tommaso L.; Ladinsky, Mark S.; Ramos, Irene; Dunleavy, Katie; Lee, Brian; Dixon, Rebekah; Chen, Steven T.; Martinez-Delgado, Gustavo; Nagula, Satish; Bruce, Emily A.; Ko, Huaibin M.; Glicksberg, Benjamin S.; Nadkarni, Girish; Pujadas, Elisabet; Reidy, Jason; Naymagon, Steven; Grinspan, Ari; Ahmad, Jawad; Tankelevich, Michael; Bram, Yaron; Gordon, Ronald; Sharma, Keshav; Houldsworth, Jane; Britton, Graham J.; Chen-Liaw, Alice; Spindler, Matthew P.; Plitt, Tamar; Wang, Pei; Cerutti, Andrea; Faith, Jeremiah J.; Colombel, Jean-Frederic; Kenigsberg, Ephraim; Argmann, Carmen; Merad, Miriam; Gnjatic, Sacha; Harpaz, Noam; Danese, Silvio; Cordon-Cardo, Carlos; Rahman, Adeeb; Schwartz, Robert E.; Kumta, Nikhil A.; Aghemo, Alessio; Bjorkman, Pamela J.; Petralia, Francesca; van Bakel, Harm; Garcia-Sastre, Adolfo; Mehandru, Saurabh",Gastroenterology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0016508521004613; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33676971/; https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2021.02.056; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016508521004613?v=s5,110

Our aim was to conduct a meta-analysis on the sensitivity and specificity of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA detection through RT-qPCR based on salivary specimens compared to conventional nasopharyngeal swabs. METHODS: We reported our meta-analysis according to the PRISMA statement. We searched Pubmed, Embase, and pre-print archive medRxiv.og for eligible studies published up to June 1(st), 2020. Raw data included true/false positive and negative tests, and the total number of tests. Sensitivity and specificity data were calculated for every study, and then pooled in a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) measure. Reporting bias was assessed by means of funnel plots and regression analysis. RESULTS: The systematic review eventually retrieved 14 studies including a total of 15 estimates, the were included in quantitative synthesis. We found a pooled specificity of 97.7% (95%CI 93.8-99.2) and a pooled sensitivity of 83.4% (95%CI 73.1–90.4), with an overall agreement assessed by means of Cohen’s kappa equals to 0.750, 95%CI 0.62-0.88 (i.e. moderate agreement), with high heterogeneity and risk of reporting bias. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, diagnostic tests based on salivary specimens are somewhat reliable, but relatively few studies have been carried out. Moreover, such studies are characterized by low numbers and low sample power. Therefore, the of salivary samples is currently questionable for clinical purposes and cannot substitute other more conventional RT-qPCR based on nasopharyngeal swabs.

However, if contact tracing and testing efficacy dropped below 60% (e.g. due to false negatives or reduced tracing capability), the number of infections kept growing exponentially, irrespective of any testing capacity. Under these conditions, the population’s geographical distribution and travel behaviour could inform sampling policies to aid a successful containment.","Fiore, Vincenzo G.; DeFelice, Nicholas; Glicksberg, Benjamin S.; Perl, Ofer; Shuster, Anastasia; Kulkarni, Kaustubh; O’Brien, Madeline; Pisauro, M.

This resulted in restructuring and shift of resources at many hospitals. The aim of our work was to detect the effects of the pandemic on the german Oto-Rhino-Laryngology (ORL) university hospitals in terms of research, student teaching and further specialist training. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The chairmen of the 39 ORL university hospitals in Germany were asked about the effects of the pandemic on research, student teaching and ORL specialist training (residency) in the period from March to April 2020 using a structured online survey. RESULTS: All 39 chairmen took part in the survey. Of these, 74.4% (29/39) stated that their research activities had deteriorated as a result of the pandemic. In 61.5% (24/39) pandemic-related research issues were addressed. All hospitals reported a restriction for in-house teaching and 97.5% (38/39) introduced new digital teaching methods. During the observation period, 74.4% of the chairmen did not see ORL specialist training (residency)at risk. CONCLUSION: Our results provide an insight into the heterogeneous effects of the pandemic. The fast processing of pandemic-related research topics and the introduction of innovative digital concepts for student teaching impressively demonstrates the great innovative potential and the ability of the ORL university hospitals to react quickly in order to maintain their tasks in research, student teaching and ORL specialist training in the best possible way even during the pandemic.","Stöver, T.; Dazert, S.; Plontke, S.

To ascertain possible reasons for the different rates of COVID-19 infections between Africa and other continents, we summarized the up-to-date scientific literature to identify possible arguments in this regard. Available literature suggests that demographic, epidemiological, sociological, genetic and immunological factors contribute in the COVID-19 severity and the susceptibly to SARS-CoV-2.

Despite the enormous efforts of scientists and clinicians around the world, there is still no drug or vaccine available worldwide for the treatment and prevention of the infection. A rapid strategy for the identification of new treatments is based on repurposing existing clinically approved drugs that show antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, after developing a quantitative structure activity relationship analysis based on molecular topology, several macrolide antibiotics are identified as promising SARS-CoV-2 spike protein inhibitors. To confirm the in silico results, the best candidates were tested against two human coronaviruses (i.e., 229E-GFP and SARS-CoV-2) in cell culture. Time-of-addition experiments and a surrogate model of viral cell entry were used to identify the steps in the virus life cycle inhibited by the compounds. Infection experiments demonstrated that azithromycin, clarithromycin, and lexithromycin reduce the intracellular accumulation of viral RNA and virus spread as well as prevent virus-induced cell death, by inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells. Even though the three macrolide antibiotics display a narrow antiviral activity window against SARS-CoV-2, it may be of interest to further investigate their effect on the viral spike protein and their potential in combination therapies for the coronavirus disease 19 early stage of infection.","Galvez, Jorge; Zanni, Riccardo; Galvez-Llompart, Maria; Benlloch, Jose Maria",J Chem Inf Model,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33734704/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c01394,110

Understanding these phenomena is vital, particularly in advanced economies faced with declining growth rates. Two novel indicators - the autocorrelation (AR1) and the variance – are found particularly useful in providing insight into inter-decadal GDP variability over this period. These indicators are first applied to the Maddison-Project historical dataset, which includes almost a century of data for some 80 countries and almost two centuries of data for 9 countries. They are additionally applied to ~50 years of recent annual data for around 130 countries from the World Bank dataset as well as ~60 years of recent quarterly data for around 20 countries from the OECD dataset. Analysis reveals inter-decadal variability in growth cycles (the recession cycle), highlighting periods of large slow growth cycles and periods of small fast growth cycles. The most commonly occurring pattern is characterised by an increase in CSD from the 1900s to 1940s, a decline in CSD between the 1930s and the 1970s, then a further increase in CSD from the 1960s to 2010. This pattern is significant in ~70% of the advanced economies. CSD indicators may then provide invaluable insights into specific aspects of inter-decadal GDP variability, such as on the nature of the business cycle, secular stagnation and the implicit “restoring forces” of the economy.","Rye, Craig D.; Jackson, Tim",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-66996-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32591556/,110

661757,The COVID-19 Trial Finder,2020-11-20,"Live-attenuated vaccines (LAVs) have achieved remarkable successes in controlling virus spread, as well as for other applications such as cancer immunotherapy. However, with rapid increases in international travel, globalization, geographic spread of viral vectors, and widespread use of vaccines, there is an increasing need to consider how pre-exposure to viruses which share similar antigenic regions can impact vaccine efficacy. Pre-existing antibodies, derived from either from maternal–fetal transmission, or by previous infection or vaccination, have been demonstrated to interfere with vaccine immunogenicity of measles, adenovirus, and influenza LAVs. Immune interference of LAVs can be caused by the formation of virus–antibody complexes that neutralize virus infection in antigen-presenting cells, or by the cross-linking of the B-cell receptor with the inhibitory receptor, FcγRIIB. On the other hand, pre-existing antibodies can augment flaviviral LAV efficacy such as that of dengue and yellow fever virus, especially when pre-existing antibodies are present at sub-neutralizing levels. The increased vaccine immunogenicity can be facilitated by antibody-dependent enhancement of virus infection, enhancing virus uptake in antigen-presenting cells, and robust induction of innate immune responses that promote vaccine immunogenicity. This review examines the literature on this topic and examines the circumstances where pre-existing antibodies can inhibit or enhance LAV efficacy. A better knowledge of the underlying mechanisms involved could allow us to better manage immunization in seropositive individuals and even identify possibilities that could allow us to exploit pre-existing antibodies to boost vaccine-induced responses for improved vaccine efficacy.","Mok, Darren Z.

This study aims to identify significant factors behind the unequal distribution of identified cases and deaths in different countries. Our study’s objective is comparative analysis and identification of relations between the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, population characteristics, and government response. METHODS: The top 18 countries worst hit by COVID-19 cases were identified. The data metrics, such as the number of cases, deaths, fatality rates, tests, average life expectancy, and population, were collected and consolidated. RESULTS: Countries with significant percentage of the older population are vulnerable to a high number of deaths due to COVID-19. Developed countries have higher per capita testing, whereas testing is less intensive in developing/underdeveloped countries. There is a consensus among health experts that COVID-19 has higher fatality rates for people above 60, however, with further age, this increases exponentially. Countries with higher life expectancy are also high-income countries, and the best course of action would be to provide specialized support to self-isolate for people of ages 75 and above. CONCLUSION: The behaviour of disease occurring at a large scale and interaction with different populations is studied to understand and differentiate the factors and measures that successfully inhibited the pandemic. The study benchmarks different countries based on their performance and efforts against the pandemic and provides some useful insights on the efficiency of their governance and potential to improve & ramp up their programs.

Due to public health restrictions, many pediatric pain clinics halted in-person appointments, delaying and disrupting access to care. There is no existing research on the impacts of COVID-19 on pediatric chronic pain care in Canada or the challenges experienced by health care professionals and pain clinics. Aims: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on Canadian pediatric chronic pain care by documenting how health care professionals provided care during the first six months of the pandemic. Methods: Two Canadian online cross-sectional surveys were conducted: one among Canadian pediatric pain clinic directors (Study 1) and another among multidisciplinary pediatric pain health care professionals (Study 2). Results: Responses from 13/13 Canadian pediatric pain clinics/rehabilitation programs indicated that all clinics provided virtual care during the pandemic. No significant changes were reported on the frequency of appointment requests. Most clinics reported no perceived change in patient pain levels (n = 9/13, 69%) or occurrence of pain flares (n = 10/13, 77%). Results from 151 individual health care professionals indicated that the majority (90%) of non–emergency department respondents were providing virtual care. The main challenges of virtual care included technological barriers, financial concerns, infrastructure and logistics, privacy, and clinical challenges.

663606,Not the Same Old Song and Dance: Viewing Racial Socialization Through a Family Systems Lens to Resist Racial Trauma,2021-09-24,"Abstract The Covid-19 pandemic has created unprecedented disruption in health care delivery around the world. In an effort to prevent hospital-acquired Covid-19 infections, most hospitals have severely curtailed elective surgery, performing only surgeries if the patient’s survival or permanent function would be compromised by a delay in surgery. As hospitals emerge from the pandemic, it will be necessary to progressively increase surgical activity at a time when hospitals continue to care for Covid-19 patients. In an attempt to mitigate the risk of nosocomial infection, we have created a patient care pathway designed to minimize risk of exposure of patients coming in to the hospital for scheduled procedures. The “Covid-minimal surgery pathway” is a predetermined patient flow, that dictates the locations, personnel and materials that come in contact with our cancer surgery population, designed to minimize risk for virus transmission. We outline the approach that allowed a large academic medical center to create a Covid-minimal cancer surgery pathway within 7 days of initiating discussions. Although the pathway represents a combination of recommended practices, there is not data to support its efficacy. We share the pathway concept and our experience so that others wishing to similarly align staff and resources towards the protection of patients, may have an easier time navigating the process.","Boffa, Daniel J.; Judson, Benjamin L.; Billingsley, Kevin G.; Galeta, Domenico; Fontanez, Paul; Odermatt, Craig; Lindner, Kristy; Mitchell, Marci R.; Henderson, Cara M.; Carafeno, Tracy; Pinto, Josephine; Wagner, Jane; Ancuta, Michael; Beley, Peggy; Turner, Anne L.; Banack, Trevor; Laurans, Maxwell S.; Johnson, Dirk C.; Yoo, Peter; Morton, John M.; Zurich, Holly; Davis, Kim; Ahuja, Nita",Ann Thorac Surg,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S000349752030713X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32417195/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000349752030713X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2020.05.003,110

The principal causes of AMS have yet to be determined. We aimed to identify the common causes of AMS in patients with COVID-19 presenting to the emergency department with AMS on arrival. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study of patients presenting with AMS to three New York hospitals, from March 1 to April 16, 2020. Underlying causes of AMS on arrival to the emergency department (ED) were categorized as (1) neurological causes (stroke, seizure, encephalitis); (2) metabolic encephalopathy; (3) indeterminant. Multivariable analysis was used to assess independent predictors. RESULTS: Overall, 166 patients presented to the ED with AMS. Metabolic encephalopathy was diagnosed as the cause in 154 (92.8%), with 118 (71.1%) categorized as multifactorial ME and 36 (21.7%) with single-cause ME. Hypoxia 103 (62.0%) and renal failure 75 (45.2%) were the most common underlying mechanisms. Neurological causes of AMS occurred in a total 20 patients (12%) and as the sole factor in 5 (3.0%); 10 (6.0%) cases were seizure related and 10 (6.0%) were cerebrovascular events. Of the 7 patients with indeterminant causes, only 1 was suspicious for encephalitis (0.6%). Age, pre-existing dementia and cerebrovascular disease, and impaired renal function were independent predictors of AMS. CONCLUSION: In patients with COVID-19, AMS on presentation to the ED is most frequently caused by metabolic encephalopathy (delirium). Seizures and cerebrovascular events contribute to a lesser degree; encephalitis appears rare.

Different from the classical appearance in infancy, neonatal presentation involves respiratory and feeding difficulties, along with characteristic pursed appearance of the mouth, myotonia, skeletal dysplasia and severe fatal hyperthermia. The clinical spectrum of this syndrome is so wide that it easily baffles with more common differentials. In this case report, a neonate born to third-degree consanguineous marriage with previous two abortions presented with respiratory difficulty, severe hyperthermia and feeding difficulty, which were daunting challenges to manage due to being refractory to standard line of management. Severe myotonia and gross dysmorphism were challenging dots to connect. Targeted exome sequencing was a ray of hope, which revealed homozygous mutation in the leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor gene on chromosome 5p13, confirming the genetic diagnosis for a fairly common spectrum of symptoms.

The study aimed to identify factors associated with anxiety, depression and insomnia among health workers involved in COVID-19 response in Nepal. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional web-based survey conducted between April 26 and May 12, 2020. A total of 475 health workers participated in the study. Anxiety and depression were measured using a 14-item Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS: 0–21) and insomnia was measured by using a 7-item Insomnia Severity Index (ISI: 0–28). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was done to determine the risk factors of mental health outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, 41.9% of health workers had symptoms of anxiety, 37.5% had depression symptoms and 33.9% had symptoms of insomnia. Stigma faced by health workers was significantly associated with higher odds of experiencing symptoms of anxiety (AOR: 2.47; 95% CI: 1.62–3.76), depression (AOR: 2.05; 95% CI: 1.34–3.11) and insomnia (AOR: 2.37; 95% CI: 1.46–3.84). History of medication for mental health problems was significantly associated with a higher likelihood of experiencing symptoms of anxiety (AOR: 3.40; 95% CI:1.31–8.81), depression (AOR: 3.83; 95% CI: 1.45–10.14) and insomnia (AOR: 3.82; 95% CI: 1.52–9.62) while inadequate precautionary measures in the workplace was significantly associated with higher odds of exhibiting symptoms of anxiety (AOR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.12–3.19) and depression (AOR: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.16–3.37). Nurses (AOR: 2.33; 95% CI: 1.21–4.47) were significantly more likely to experience anxiety symptoms than other health workers. CONCLUSION: The study findings revealed a considerate proportion of anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms among health workers during the early phase of the pandemic in Nepal. Health workers facing stigma, those with history of medication for mental health problems, and those reporting inadequate precautionary measures in their workplace were more at risk of developing mental health outcomes. A focus on improving mental wellbeing of health workers should be immediately initiated with attention to reduction of stigma, ensuring an adequate support system such as personal protective equipments, and family support for those with history of mental health problems.","Khanal, Pratik; Devkota, Navin; Dahal, Minakshi; Paudel, Kiran; Joshi, Devavrat",Global Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00621-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32977818/,110

Numerous researchers and pharmaceutical companies are working on developing vaccines and treatments; however, a clear solution has yet to be found. The current study proposes the use of artificial intelligence methods to comprehend biomedical knowledge and infer the characteristics of COVID-19. A biomedical knowledge base was established via FastText, a word embedding technique, using PubMed literature from the past decade. Subsequently, a new knowledge base was created using recently published COVID-19 articles. Using this newly constructed knowledge base from the word embedding model, a list of anti-infective drugs and proteins of either human or coronavirus origin were inferred to be related, because they are located close to COVID-19 on the knowledge base. This study attempted to form a method to quickly infer related information about COVID-19 using the existing knowledge base, before sufficient knowledge about COVID-19 is accumulated. With COVID-19 not completely overcome, machine learning-based research in the PubMed literature will provide a broad guideline for researchers and pharmaceutical companies working on treatments for COVID-19.","Yang, Heyoung; Sohn, Eunsoo",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33804131/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18063005,110

RNA extraction is a key pre-analytical step in RT-qPCR, often achieved using commercial kits. However, the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic is causing disruptions to the global supply chains used by many diagnostic laboratories to procure the commercial kits required for RNA extraction. Shortage in these essential reagents is even more acute in developing countries with no means to produce kits locally. We sought to find an alternative procedure to replace commercial kits using common reagents found in molecular biology laboratories. Here we report a method for RNA extraction that takes about 40 min to complete ten samples, and is not more laborious than current commercial RNA extraction kits. We demonstrate that this method can be used to process nasopharyngeal swab samples and yields RT-qPCR results comparable to those obtained with commercial kits. Most importantly, this procedure can be easily implemented in any molecular diagnostic laboratory. Frequent testing is crucial for individual patient management as well as for public health decision making in this pandemic. Implementation of this method could maintain crucial testing going despite commercial kit shortages.","Wozniak, Aniela; Cerda, Ariel; Ibarra-Henríquez, Catalina; Sebastian, Valentina; Armijo, Grace; Lamig, Liliana; Miranda, Carolina; Lagos, Marcela; Solari, Sandra; Guzmán, Ana María; Quiroga, Teresa; Hitschfeld, Susan; Riveras, Eleodoro; Ferrés, Marcela; Gutiérrez, Rodrigo A.; García, Patricia",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-73616-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33024174/,110

Recent studies have also shown that the prevalence of depression and anxiety increased during the COVID-19 outbreak. We aimed to evaluate the anxiety and depression levels during the pandemic and identify the effect of pandemic-related stress on blood pressure (BP) control in primary hypertensive patients. METHOD: A total of 142 patients with primary hypertension (HT) who continued to use the same antihypertensive drugs before and during the pandemic were included in the study. Twenty-four -hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire were applied to patients. We retrospectively reviewed 24-h ABPM records of the same patients for the year before the pandemic. RESULTS: Daytime, nighttime and 24 -hour-systolic blood pressure (SBP) levels as well as daytime, nighttime, and 24- hour-diastolic blood pressure (DBP) levels , were significantly elevated during the COVID-19 outbreak compared to the pre-pandemic period (p<0.001). Higher HADS-A scores (HADS-A ≥7) were significantly associated with much greater increase in BP compared to the patients with lower HADS-A scores. CONCLUSION: Psychological stress due to the COVID-19 outbreak led to worsening of the regulation of BP in controlled hypertensive patients whose antihypertensive treatments did not change.","Celik, Mehmet; Yilmaz, Yusuf; Karagoz, Ali; Kahyaoglu, Muzaffer; Cakmak, Ender Ozgun; Kup, Ayhan; Celik, Fatma Betül; Karaduman, Ahmet; Kulahcioglu, Seyhmus; Izci, Servet; Gecmen, Cetin; Caliskan, Mustafa",Medeni Med J,https://doi.org/10.5222/mmj.2021.08364; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34239759/,110

Many tests have been developed, yet with variable speeds to first results, and are of unknown quality, particularly when considering the prediction of neutralizing capacity. The LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay was designed to measure antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 native S1/S2 proteins in a standardized automated chemiluminescence assay. The clinical and analytical performances of the test were validated in an observational study using residual samples (>1,500) with a positive or negative COVID-19 diagnosis. The LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay proved to be highly selective and specific and offered semiquantitative measures of serum or plasma levels of anti-S1/S2 IgG with neutralizing activity. The assay’s diagnostic sensitivities were 91.3% and 95.7% at >5 or ≥15 days from diagnosis, respectively, and 100% when assessed against a neutralizing assay. The assay’s specificity ranged between 97% and 98.5%. The average imprecision of the assay was a <5% coefficient of variation. Assay performance at 2 different cutoffs was evaluated to optimize predictive values. The automated LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay brings efficient, sensitive, specific, and precise serological testing to the laboratory, with the capacity to test large amounts of samples per day; first results are available within 35 min, with a throughput of 170 tests/hour. The semiquantitative results provided by the test also associate with the presence of neutralizing antibodies and may provide a useful tool for the large-scale screening of convalescent-phase plasma for safe therapeutic use.","Bonelli, Fabrizio; Sarasini, Antonella; Zierold, Claudia; Calleri, Mariella; Bonetti, Alice; Vismara, Chiara; Blocki, Frank A.; Pallavicini, Luca; Chinali, Alberto; Campisi, Daniela; Percivalle, Elena; DiNapoli, Anna Pia; Perno, Carlo Federico; Baldanti, Fausto",J Clin Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32580948/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01224-20,110

To expand the supply, we validated a rapidly applicable low-cost decontamination protocol in compliance with US-regulatory guidelines to enable the safe reuse of personalized, disposable N95-respirators. Methods: Four common models of N95-respirators were disinfected for 60 minutes at {degrees}C either at 0% or 50% relative humidity (RH). Effective inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and E. coli was evaluated in inoculated masks. The N95 filter integrity was examined with scanning electron microscopy. The protective function of disinfected N95 respirators was tested against US NIOSH standards for particle filtration efficiency, breathing resistance and respirator fit. Results: A single heat treatment inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (undetectable, detection limit: 100 TCID50/ml) and E. coli (0 colonies at 50%RH) in all four respirator models. Even N95-respirators that underwent ten dry heat, or up to five 50%RH-controlled decontamination cycles maintained their integrity and met US-governmental criteria for approval regarding fit (10x dry heat: 194.48 {+/-} 15.5; 99%CI: 185.5 to 203.5; 5x at 50%RH: 198.2 {+/-} 6.3; 99%CI: 189.4 to 207; n=23 each, pass value [≥] 100,), breathing resistance (10x dry heat: 68.0 {+/-} 8.4 Pa, 99%CI: 61.8 to 74.1, n=16; 5x at 50%RH: 78.5 {+/-} 19.7 Pa, 99%CI: 21 to 135.9, n=4, pass value [≤] 343.23Pa), and filtration levels (10x dry heat: 97.6 {+/-} 1.1%, 99%CI: 96.8 to 98.4; n=16; 5x at 50%RH: 97.18 {+/-} 0.49, 99%CI: 95.7 to 98.6, n=4, pass value [≥] 95 %).

CKD patients are at high risk of being exposed to COVID-19 and suffer complications and poor outcome. In Sweden, mitigation strategies did not include lockdown. During March–April of 2020, wide-spread infection occurred in Stockholm. METHODS: Management and outcomes in forty hemodialysis (HD) patients and 4 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, with symptomatic COVID-19 in greater Stockholm during March and April of 2020 are reported. RESULTS: Twenty-four HD patients (60%) required medical care and hospitalization, whereas 16 patients (40%) were treated at home. Nine patients died (mortality rate of 22.5%), of whom 8 were men. The median age in non-survivors (78 years) was significantly higher than in survivors (p = 0.003). The median time in dialysis (11.5 years) was also significantly longer in non-survivors (p = 0.01). C-reactive protein (CRP) at diagnosis in 7 of non-survivors (median 213 mg/L, range 86–329 mg/L) was significantly higher than the CRP in 25 survivors (median 87 mg/L, range 1–328 mg/L) (p = 0.0003). Maximum CRP also indicated poorer outcome among hospitalized patients (p = 0.0004). The gender imbalance was striking with only men dying apart from 1 elderly woman. Only 4 PD patients were hospitalized with symptomatic COVID-19. One patient died, 2 were discharged, and 1 was treated at the intensive care unit and survived. CONCLUSION: HD patients >70 years were reported with longer dialysis vintage, higher CRP, and males were at an increased risk of dying from COVID-19, whereas those <70 years seemed to have a milder disease. Mitigation strategies to reduce rates of infection in high-risk populations remain essential. Follow-up focusing on long-term prognosis for extrapulmonary manifestations is likely to be important also in dialysis patients.","Smolander, Jessica; Bruchfeld, Annette",Kidney Blood Press Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33774645/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000514268,110

In this prospective, single-center study, we enrolled hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and highly suspicious patients with compatible chest computed tomography features. Cardiac injury was defined as a rise of serum high sensitivity cardiac Troponin-I level above 99th percentile (men: > 26 ng/mL, women: > 11 ng/mL). A total of 386 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were included. Cardiac injury was present among 115 (29.8%) of the study population. The development of cardiac injury was significantly associated with a higher in-hospital mortality rate compared to those with normal troponin levels (40.9% vs 11.1%, p value < 0.001). It was shown that patients with cardiac injury had a significantly lower survival rate after a median follow-up of 18 days from symptom onset (p log-rank < 0.001). It was further demonstrated in the multivariable analysis that cardiac injury could possibly increase the risk of short-term mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (HR = 1.811, p-value = 0.023). Additionally, preexisting cardiovascular disease, malignancy, blood oxygen saturation < 90%, leukocytosis, and lymphopenia at presentation were independently associated with a greater risk of developing cardiac injury. Development of cardiac injury in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was significantly associated with higher rates of in-hospital mortality and poor in-hospital outcomes. Additionally, it was shown that development of cardiac injury was associated with a lower short-term survival rate compared to patients without myocardial damage and could independently increase the risk of short-term mortality by nearly two-fold.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate literature on current applications, therapeutic areas, and outcomes of telehealth interventions in rural communities in the United States. METHODS: A narrative review of studies published on PubMed from January 2017 to December 2020 was conducted. Key search terms included telehealth, telemedicine, rural, and outcomes. RESULTS: Among 15 included studies, 9 studies analyzed telehealth interventions in patients, 3 in health care professionals, and 3 in both patients and health care professionals. The included studies reported positive outcomes and experiences of telehealth use in rural populations including acceptability and increased satisfaction; they also noted that technology is convenient and efficient. Other notable benefits included decreased direct and indirect costs to the patient (travel cost and time) and health care service provider (staffing), lower onsite health care resource utilization, improved physician recruitment and retention, improved access to care, and increased education and training of patients and health care professionals. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth models were associated with positive outcomes for patients and health care professionals, suggesting these models are feasible and can be effective. Future telehealth interventions and studies examining these programs are warranted, especially in rural communities, and future research should evaluate the impact of increased telehealth use as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Butzner, Michael; Cuffee, Yendelela",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34435965/; https://doi.org/10.2196/29575,110

673620,Beyond a shared experience: Queer and trans youth navigating COVID-19,2021-03-11,"Background: On March 29th, 2021, Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommended against using the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in younger adults pending further review of the risk for Vaccine-Induced Prothrombotic Immune Thrombocytopenia (VIPIT). As a result, the province of British Columbia halted its front-line workers vaccination program which used the AstraZeneca vaccine. The province is expected to receive an additional 246,700 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine through US and COVAX until April 11th, enough to provide the first dose of vaccine to all unvaccinated front-line workers. It is unclear whether the alternative, mRNA vaccines can be immediately made available to front-line workers. We evaluated the harms and benefits of delaying vaccination of front-line workers in BC. Methods: We reviewed the latest available evidence and used compartmental modelling to *1)* compare the expected number of deaths due to COVID-19 and VIPIT under the scenarios of immediately continuing vaccination of front-line workers with the AstraZeneca vaccine or delaying it in favour of mRNA vaccines, and *2)* compare the individual mortality risk of immediately receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine with waiting to receive an mRNA vaccine later for different age groups. Results: We estimate that if British Columbia continues the front-line worker vaccination program with the AstraZeneca vaccine, we expect to see approximately 27,000 fewer cases of COVID-19, 500 fewer hospitalizations, 80 fewer COVID-related deaths, and 1,400 fewer cases of Long COVID from April 1st to October 1st, 2021, for an expected number of VIPIT-related deaths of 0.674 [95% CI 0.414-0.997]. In the same period and in areas of high transmission, the projected excess risk of mortality due to COVID-19 and VIPIT was significantly higher in the delayed vaccination with the mRNA vaccine scenario (3.23 to 4.44 times higher risk) than that of immediate vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine for those between 30 and 69 years of age. For those under 30, immediate vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine posed a higher risk than delayed vaccination with an mRNA vaccine. Conclusions: The benefits of immediately continuing immunization of front-line workers with the AstraZeneca vaccine far outweigh the risk both at a societal level and at an individual risk level for those over 40, and those over 30 in high-risk areas.","Adibi, A.; Mozafarihashjin, M.; Sadatsafavi, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.11.21255138v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.11.21255138,110

UGS are increasingly seen as a potential solution for sustainable urban planning and development. Informal green spaces (IGS), even though they may make up a large share of UGS, are often overlooked in this regard. This study examines residents’ awareness of the ecosystem services provided by IGS and their need for redevelopment. The data were collected through structured interviews in the immediate vicinity of selected IGS in the Polish city of Łódź. Łódź is typical of post-industrial European cities struggling with environmental (heatwaves, cloudbursts), social (aging, depopulation) and spatial (a neglected and dense city center) issues. Our results show that residents saw IGS as places able to provide a range of services, mostly of the regulating type, and even minor design interventions can improve the attractiveness of IGS. Taking this into account, we conclude that IGS are important vegetated areas in the city, which can be complementary to formal greenery.","Włodarczyk-Marciniak, Renata; Sikorska, Daria; Krauze, Kinga",Sustain Cities Soc,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210670720302237; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32395422/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670720302237?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2020.102236,110

In this study, the PM(2.5) concentration data obtained from 340 PM(2.5) ground stations in south-central China were used to analyze the variation patterns of PM(2.5) in south-central China at different time periods, and six PM(2.5) interpolation models were developed in the region. The spatial and temporal PM(2.5) variation patterns in central and southern China were analyzed from the perspectives of time series variations and spatial distribution characteristics, and six types of interpolation models were established in central and southern China. (1) Through correlation analysis, and exploratory regression and geographical detector methods, the correlation analysis of PM(2.5)-related variables showed that the GNSS-derived PWV and ZTD were negatively correlated with PM(2.5), and that their significances and contributions to the spatial analysis were good. (2) Three types of suitable variable combinations were selected for modeling through a collinearity diagnosis, and six types of models (geographically weighted regression (GWR), geographically weighted regression kriging (GWRK), geographically weighted regression—empirical bayesian kriging (GWR-EBK), multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR), multiscale geographically weighted regression kriging (MGWRK), and multiscale geographically weighted regression—empirical bayesian kriging (MGWR-EBK)) were constructed. The overall R(2) of the GWR-EBK model construction was the best (annual: 0.962, winter: 0.966, spring: 0.926, summer: 0.873, and autumn: 0.908), and the interpolation accuracy of the GWR-EBK model constructed by inputting ZTD was the best overall, with an average RMSE of 3.22 μg/m(3) recorded, while the GWR-EBK model constructed by inputting PWV had the highest interpolation accuracy in winter, with an RMSE of 4.5 μg/m(3) recorded; these values were 2.17% and 4.26% higher than the RMSE values of the other two types of models (ZTD and temperature) in winter, respectively. (3) The introduction of the empirical Bayesian kriging method to interpolate the residuals of the models (GWR and MGWR) and to then correct the original interpolation results of the models was the most effective, and the accuracy improvement percentage was better than that of the ordinary kriging method. The average improvement ratios of the GWRK and GWR-EBK models compared with that of the GWR model were 5.04% and 14.74%, respectively, and the average improvement ratios of the MGWRK and MGWR-EBK models compared with that of the MGWR model were 2.79% and 12.66%, respectively. (4) Elevation intervals and provinces were classified, and the influence of the elevation and the spatial distribution of the plane on the accuracy of the PM(2.5) regional model was discussed. The experiments showed that the accuracy of the constructed regional model decreased as the elevation increased. The accuracies of the models in representing Henan, Hubei and Hunan provinces were lower than those of the models in representing Guangdong and Guangxi provinces.","Wei, Pengzhi; Xie, Shaofeng; Huang, Liangke; Liu, Lilong",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18157931; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34360223/,110

This shortage has been further worsened by screening of asymptomatic populations such as returning employees, students, and so on, as part of plans to reopen the economy. To optimize the utilization of testing reagents and human resources, pool testing of populations with low prevalence has emerged as a promising strategy. Although pooling is an effective solution to reduce the number of reagents used for testing, the process of pooling samples together and tracking them throughout the entire workflow is challenging. To be effective, samples must be tracked into each pool, pool-tested and reported individually. In this article, we address these challenges using robotics and informatics.","Balasubramani, Balaji; Newsom, Kimberly J.; Martinez, Katherine A.; Starostik, Petr; Clare-Salzler, Michael; Chamala, Srikar",Acad Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34189259/; https://doi.org/10.1177/23742895211020485,110

Clinicians around the world looked to cities that first experienced major surges to inform their preparations to prevent and manage the impact the pandemic would bring to their patients and health care systems. Although this information provided insight into how COVID-19 could affect the Canadian palliative care system, it remained unclear what to expect. Toronto, the largest city in Canada, experienced its first known case of COVID-19 in January 2020; with the first peak in cases occurring in April and its second wave beginning this September. Despite warnings of increased clinical loads, as well as widespread shortages of staff, personal protection equipment, medications, and inpatient beds, the calls to action by international colleagues to support the palliative care needs of patients with COVID-19 were not realized in Toronto. This article explores the effects of the pandemic on Toronto's palliative care planning and reports of clinical load and capacity, beds, staffing and redeployment, and medication and PPE shortages. The Toronto palliative care experience illustrates the international need for strategies to ensure the integration of palliative care into COVID-19 management, and to optimize the use of palliative care systems during the pandemic.","Wentlandt, Kirsten; Cook, Rose; Morgan, Matt; Nowell, Allyson; Kaya, Ebru; Zimmermann, Camilla",J Pain Symptom Manage,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33549737/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0885392421001585; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885392421001585?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2021.01.137,110

The general public construed the pandemic threat as being ‘far away’ and associated it with foreign practices and behaviours. Social media discourse was initially replete with indifference about the perceived risk. Conflicting views about the possibility of the pandemic spreading to Africa and the complexity of explaining its causes delayed the desired understanding of the reality of the global public health concern. The popular public response to the COVID-19 control discourse is therefore characterised by ambivalence about embracing the pandemic control protocols. Drawing on content and discourse analysis of musical and poetic compositions on COVID-19 by artists in East Africa and shared among WhatsApp users in Kenya, this article describes local perspectives on COVID-19 risk and their health promotion implications. It explores local construction of the meaning of the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences for effective health promotion. The article considers the spontaneous musical and poetic performances by experienced and amateur artists as local attempts to enhance compliance with the global COVID-19 control protocols and popular participation in local health promotion. The basic premise is that artists’ creation and sharing of digital COVID-19 lyrics denote their attempt to go beyond the medical logic of health promotion by including broad aspects of a cultural logic of care. This approach would establish an integrated and sustainable health promotion framework to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and its impact on local societal wellbeing.","Mulemi, Benson A.",Glob Health Promot,https://doi.org/10.1177/1757975920973671; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33331235/,110

This report presents the discordant results of two widely used RT-PCR kits in Indonesia due to different CT-value cut-offs and highlights its potential consequence in SARS-CoV-2 containment. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swab samples with SARS-CoV-2 negative with a RT-PCR kit (manufacture pre-set CT-value cut-off was 35 amplification cycles) were retested with another RT-PCR kit with a higher pre-set CT-value of 40 amplification cycles. All procedures were performed according to the manufacturer protocols. RESULTS: In total, 30 samples with SARS-CoV-2 negative for the first kit were retested. We found that 25 out of 33 samples (75.5%) were positive using the second RT-PCR kit that had a higher manufacture pre-set CT-value cut-off. In addition, among 500 RT-PCR tests using the first RT-PCR kit, 103 of them (20.6%) were categorized as inconclusive results based on the second manufacturer’ guideline. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our data suggest the possibility of discordant results of SARS-CoV-2 detection due to different pre-set cut-offs by the companies. As consequence, this could leave a fraction of individuals who were misclassified that could act as source of virus transmission within community.","Pranata, A.; Zulkifli, B.; Santosa, S.F.; Oktiviyari, A.; Zulfitri, Z.; Hayati, Z.; Mudatsir, M.; Ichsan, I.; Harapan, H.",Vacunas,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vacun.2021.05.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34305496/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1576988721000364; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1576988721000364,110

Infection of SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy is associated with complications such as preterm labor and premature rupture of membranes, and a proportion of neonates born to infected mothers are also positive for the virus. During pregnancy, the placental barrier protects the fetus from pathogens and ensures healthy development. To predict if the placenta is permissive to SARS-CoV-2, we utilized publicly available single-cell RNA-seq data to identify if the placental cells express the necessary factors required for infection. SARS-CoV-2 binding receptor ACE2 and the S protein priming protease TMPRSS2 are co-expressed by a subset of syncytiotrophoblasts (STB) in the first trimester and extravillous trophoblasts (EVT) in the second trimester human placenta. In addition, the non-canonical receptor BSG/CD147 and other proteases (CTSL, CTSB, and FURIN) are detected in most of the placental cells. Other coronavirus family receptors (ANPEP and DPP4) were also expressed in the first and second trimester placental cells. Additionally, the term placenta of multiple species including humans expressed ACE2, DPP4, and ANPEP along with the viral S protein proteases. The ACE2- and TMPRSS2-positive (ACE2 + TMPRSS2 +) placental subsets expressed mRNA for proteins involved in viral budding and replication. These cells also had the mRNA for proteins that physically interact with SARS-CoV-2 in host cells. Further, we discovered unique signatures of genes in ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + STBs and EVTs. The ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + STBs are highly differentiated cells and express genes involving mitochondrial metabolism and glucose transport. The second trimester ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + EVTs are enriched for markers of endovascular trophoblasts. Both these subtypes abundantly expressed genes in the Toll-like receptor pathway. The second trimester EVTs are also enriched for components of the JAK-STAT pathway that drives inflammation. We carried out a systematic review and identified that in 12% of pregnant women with COVID-19, the placenta was infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the virus was detected in STBs. To conclude, herein we have uncovered the cellular targets for SARS-CoV-2 entry and have shown that these cells can potentially drive viremia in the developing human placenta. Our results provide a basic framework toward understanding the paraphernalia involved in SARS-CoV-2 infections in pregnancy.","Ashary, Nancy; Bhide, Anshul; Chakraborty, Priyanka; Colaco, Stacy; Mishra, Anuradha; Chhabria, Karisma; Jolly, Mohit Kumar; Modi, Deepak",Front Cell Dev Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32974340/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2020.00783,110

METHODS: Postmenopausal osteoporosis patients with a high risk of fracture—154 in total—were recruited; their therapies were switched to ROMO or DENO from BP/naïve or vitamin D (ND) (ND-ROMO: 43, BP-ROMO: 38, ND-DENO: 38, and BP-DENO: 35). Longitudinal changes in bone metabolic markers and BMD were evaluated. RESULTS: ROMO groups showed significant increases in BMD of the lumbar spine at 6 and 12 months and femoral neck at 12 months compared to the DENO groups. Although BP-ROMO showed significant increase in the lumbar spine BMD compared to BP-DENO, there were no significant differences in femoral neck and total hip BMDs between BP-ROMO and BP-DENO. Among the ROMO groups, % changes of BMD from baseline to 12 months were associated with bone metabolic markers at baseline and changes in TRACP-5b from baseline to 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: ROMO continuously increased BMD for 12 months and performed better than DENO. On the other hand, effects of ROMO switched from BP on BMD of femoral neck and total hip were almost same with DENO. Bone metabolic markers at baseline and changes in TRACP-5b from baseline to 3 months may predict the efficacy of ROMO after 12 months of administration.","Shimizu, Tomohiro; Arita, Kosuke; Murota, Eihiro; Hiratsuka, Shigeto; Fujita, Ryo; Ishizu, Hotaka; Asano, Tsuyoshi; Takahashi, Daisuke; Takahata, Masahiko; Iwasaki, Norimasa",J Bone Miner Metab,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33847831/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00774-021-01226-1,110

Contemporary usage of the term ‘SCAD’ is typically synonymous with NA-SCAD. COVID-19 could induce a vascular inflammation localized in the coronary adventitia and periadventitial fat and contribute to the development of an A-SCAD of a vulnerable plaque in a susceptible patient. CASE SUMMARY: In this report we describe a case of a COVID-19 patient with past cardiac history of CAD who was admitted for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Coronary angiography demonstrated the culprit lesion in the proximal LAD that presented with a very complex and unusual morphology, indicative of an A-SCAD. The diagnosis of A-SCAD was supported by the presence of a mild stenosis in the same coronary segment in the last angiogram performed 3 years previously. He was successfully treated by PCI, had a favourable course of the COVID-19 with no symptoms of pneumonia, and was discharged from the hospital after two negative tests for SARS-CoV-2. DISCUSSION: A higher index of suspicion of A-SCAD is needed in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 presenting with ACS. The proposed approach with ‘thrombolysis first’ for treating STEMI patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection could be unsafe in the case of underlying A-SCAD.","Albiero, Remo; Seresini, Giuseppe",Eur Heart J Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33089040/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjcr/ytaa133,110

The purpose of this research is to develop an epidemi- ological model that allow to estimate the number of unknown/asymptomatic cases in a given area. The SEIAMPR system, a novel simulation based model for COVID-19 is designed and implemented in Python. The intuition of the model is simple: about 80% of COVID-19 infected people evolve as asymptomatic or with a mild clinical course, many of them remain unknown to the authorities, some of them including those in critical conditions are eventually detected and classified as positive cases. The simulator reproduces this process using an adaptive method integrated with official data. The simulator has been used for modelling the outbreak in 21 regions in Italy. The positive effects of lockdown policies are demonstrated: unknown ac- tive cases 12 days after the lockdown (March the 21th) ranged from 284101 to 374038, e.g. many more than all the official cases in Italy, reducing to 10213/20949 the reopening day. The number of unknown active cases at the beginning of June in the Lombardia region ranged from 6813 to 13390 de- manding particular attention.

684911,Compounded Cerium Nitrate—Silver Sulfadiazine Cream is Safe and Effective for the Treatment of Burn Wounds: A Burn Center’s Four-Year Experience,2021-09-20,"BACKGROUND: Chronic anorexia nervosa is a tragic disease with no known effective pharmacological or behavioral treatment. We report the case of a 29 year-old woman who struggled with severe and enduring anorexia nervosa for 15 years, and experienced a complete recovery following a novel treatment of adopting a ketogenic diet followed by ketamine infusions. Her remission has persisted for over 6 months. CASE PRESENTATION: At age 14.5, the patient embarked on an effort to “eat healthy.” She quickly lost control of the dieting, developed associated compulsions and obsessions about food, body dissatisfaction, emotional lability, and lost nearly 13.6 kilograms (30 pounds). She was hospitalized for 6 weeks, and while she regained some weight, she did not attain full weight restoration. For 15 years, she continued to eat in a restrictive manner, exercise compulsively, and have intermittent periods of alcohol dependence. Nevertheless, she always hoped to get well, and at age 29, she began a novel treatment for anorexia nervosa. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a ketogenic diet used specifically for the treatment of anorexia nervosa, followed by a short series of titrated IV ketamine infusions leading to complete remission of severe and enduring anorexia nervosa, with weight restoration, and sustained cessation of cognitive and behavioral symptoms, for 6 months. Although these treatments were used sequentially the relationship between these modalities, and possible synergy, is unclear, and deserves further study. Complete and sustained remission of chronic anorexia nervosa is quite rare, and the novel use of a ketogenic diet and IV ketamine treatment in this potentially lethal condition suggests avenues for further research, and hope for patients and their families.","Scolnick, Barbara; Zupec-Kania, Beth; Calabrese, Lori; Aoki, Chiye; Hildebrandt, Thomas",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32848935/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00763,110
684997,Resilience and demographic characteristics predicting distress during the COVID-19 crisis,2020-09-25,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth became a vital resource to contain the virus’s spread and ensure continuity of care of patients with a chronic condition, notably arterial hypertension and heart disease. This paper reports the experience based on a telehealth platform used at scale to manage chronic disease patients in the Italian community. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Patients’ health status was remotely monitored through ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), resting or ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG), spirometry, sleep oximetry, and cardiorespiratory polysomnography performed in community pharmacies or general practitioners’ offices. Patients also monitored their blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), blood oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), body temperature, body weight, waist circumference, blood glucose, and lipids at home through a dedicated smartphone app. All data conveyed to the web-based telehealth platform were used to manage critical patients by doctors promptly. Data were analyzed and compared across three consecutive periods of 2 months each: i) before the national lockdown, ii) during the lockdown (from March 9 to May 17, 2020), and iii) after the end of the containment measures. Overall, 13,613 patients visited community pharmacies or doctors’ offices. The number of overall tests dropped during and rose after the lockdown. The overall proportion of abnormal tests was larger during the outbreak. A significant increase in the prevalence of abnormal ECGs due to myocardial ischemia, contrasted by a significantly improved BP control, was observed. The number of home users and readings exchanged increased during the pandemic. In 226 patients, a significant increase in the proportion of SpO(2) readings and a significant reduction in the entries for all other parameters, except BP, was observed. The proportion of abnormal SpO(2) and BP values was significantly lower during the lockdown. Following the lockdown, the proportion of abnormal body weight or waist circumference values increased. CONCLUSIONS: Our study results support the usefulness of a telehealth solution to detect deterioration of the health status during the COVID-19 pandemic.

There is increasing recognition in the literature of the impact of caregiving in palliative care settings, including compassion fatigue and compassion satisfaction. However, to date this literature has not been systematically reviewed. The purpose of this scoping review was to map the literature on compassion fatigue and compassion satisfaction among palliative care health providers caring for adult patients. METHODS: Scoping review method guided by Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines was conducted using four electronic databases to identify the relevant studies published with no time limit. Following the title and abstract review, two reviewers independently screened full-text articles, and extracted study data. A narrative approach to synthesizing the literature was used. RESULTS: Twenty studies were included in the review. Five themes emerged from synthesis: conceptualisation of compassion fatigue and compassion satisfaction; measurement of compassion fatigue and compassion satisfaction; consequences of compassion fatigue or compassion satisfaction and providing care for patients with life-threatening conditions; predictors or associated factors of compassion fatigue and compassion satisfaction among palliative care health providers; and strategies or interventions to support palliative care health providers and reduce compassion fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Limited studies examined the effectiveness of specific interventions to improve compassion satisfaction and reduce compassion fatigue among palliative care health providers. Further investigation of the impacts of compassion fatigue and compassion satisfaction on palliative care health providers and their work is also needed.","Baqeas, Manal Hassan; Davis, Jenny; Copnell, Beverley",BMC Palliat Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34162388/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12904-021-00784-5,110

Perspective from a UK burns centre,2020-08-29,"Viral infections cause a variety of acute and chronic human diseases, sometimes resulting in small local outbreaks, or in some cases spreading across the globe and leading to global pandemics. Understanding and exploiting virus–host interactions is instrumental for identifying host factors involved in viral replication, developing effective antiviral agents, and mitigating the severity of virus-borne infectious diseases. The diversity of CRISPR systems and CRISPR-based tools enables the specific modulation of innate immune responses and has contributed impressively to the fields of virology and immunology in a very short time. In this review, we describe the most recent advances in the use of CRISPR systems for basic and translational studies of virus–host interactions.","Brezgin, Sergey; Kostyusheva, Anastasiya; Bayurova, Ekaterina; Volchkova, Elena; Gegechkori, Vladimir; Gordeychuk, Ilya; Glebe, Dieter; Kostyushev, Dmitry; Chulanov, Vladimir",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13071373; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34372578/,110

Methods This is a retrospective analysis of 405 individuals infected with SARS-CoV2 in Kuwait. Outcomes such as symptoms severity and mortality were considered. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to report the odds ratios (OR) for ICU admission and dying from COVID-19. Results The cohort included 290 Arabs and 115 South Asians. South Asians recorded significantly higher COVID-19 death rates compared to Arabs (33% vs. 7.6%, P value<0.001). When compared to Arabs, South Asians also had higher odds of being admitted to the ICU (OR = 6.28, 95% CI: 3.34-11.80, p < 0.001). South Asian patients showed 7.62 (95% CI: 3.62-16.02, p < 0.001) times the odds of dying from COVID-19. Conclusion COVID-19 patients with South Asians ethnicity are more likely to have worse prognosis and outcome when compared to patients with Arab ethnicity. This suggest a possible role for ethnicity in COVID-19 outcome disparities and this role is likely to be multifactorial.","Ali, H.; Alshukry, A.; Marafie, S.

Whilst recent years have seen enormous success in the reduction of cardiovascular risk using conventional pharmaceuticals, there is increasing interest amongst patients and practitioners in the use of nutraceuticals to combat dyslipidaemias and inflammation in cardiovascular disease. Nutraceutical is a portmanteau term: ‘ceutical’ indicate pharmaceutical-grade preparations, and ‘nutra’ indicates that the products contain nutrients from food. Until relatively recently, little high-quality evidence relating to the safety and efficacy of nutraceuticals has been available to prescribers and policymakers. However, as a result of recent randomised-controlled trials, cohort studies and meta-analyses, this situation is changing, and nutraceuticals are now recommended in several mainstream guidelines relating to dyslipidaemias and atherosclerosis. This article will summarise recent clinical-practice guidance relating to the use of nutraceuticals in this context and the evidence which underlies them. Particular attention is given to position papers and recommendations from the International Lipid Expert Panel (ILEP), which has produced several practical and helpful recommendations in this field.","Penson, Peter E.; Banach, Maciej",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13092957; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34578834/,110

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a comprehensive literature search from several databases. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed in abstracting data and assessing validity. Quality assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale (NOS). D-dimer levels were pooled and compared between severe/non-severe and surviving/non-surviving patient groups. Weighted mean difference (WMD), risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies reported on D-dimer levels in 5750 non-severe and 2063 severe patients and 16 studies reported on D-dimer levels in 2783 surviving and 697 non-surviving cases. D-dimer levels were significantly higher in patients with severe clinical status (WMD: 0.45 mg/L, 95% CI: 0.34–0.56; p < 0.0001). Non-surviving patients had significantly higher D-dimer levels compared to surviving patients (WMD: 5.32 mg/L, 95% CI: 3.90–6.73; p < 0.0001). D-dimer levels above the upper limit of normal (ULN) was associated with higher risk of severity (RR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.25–2.00; p < 0.0001) and mortality (RR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.40–2.37; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Increased levels of D-dimer levels measured on admission are significantly correlated with the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia and may predict mortality in hospitalized patients.","Gungor, Baris; Atici, Adem; Baycan, Omer Faruk; Alici, Gokhan; Ozturk, Fatih; Tugrul, Sevil; Asoglu, Ramazan; Cevik, Erdem; Sahin, Irfan; Barman, Hasan Ali",Am J Emerg Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735675720308123; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675720308123?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.09.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069541/,110
689755,581 The Effects of the COVID Pandemic on Burn Clinic,2021-04-01,"[Image: see text] This Perspective focuses on thiol-mediated uptake, that is, the entry of substrates into cells enabled by oligochalcogenides or mimics, often disulfides, and inhibited by thiol-reactive agents. A short chronology from the initial observations in 1990 until today is followed by a summary of cell-penetrating poly(disulfide)s (CPDs) and cyclic oligochalcogenides (COCs) as privileged scaffolds in thiol-mediated uptake and inhibitors of thiol-mediated uptake as potential antivirals. In the spirit of a Perspective, the main part brings together topics that possibly could help to explain how thiol-mediated uptake really works. Extreme sulfur chemistry mostly related to COCs and their mimics, cyclic disulfides, thiosulfinates/-onates, diselenolanes, benzopolysulfanes, but also arsenics and Michael acceptors, is viewed in the context of acidity, ring tension, exchange cascades, adaptive networks, exchange affinity columns, molecular walkers, ring-opening polymerizations, and templated polymerizations. Micellar pores (or lipid ion channels) are considered, from cell-penetrating peptides and natural antibiotics to voltage sensors, and a concise gallery of membrane proteins, as possible targets of thiol-mediated uptake, is provided, including CLIC1, a thiol-reactive chloride channel; TMEM16F, a Ca-activated scramblase; EGFR, the epithelial growth factor receptor; and protein-disulfide isomerase, known from HIV entry or the transferrin receptor, a top hit in proteomics and recently identified in the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2.","Laurent, Quentin; Martinent, Rémi; Lim, Bumhee; Pham, Anh-Tuan; Kato, Takehiro; López-Andarias, Javier; Sakai, Naomi; Matile, Stefan",JACS Au,https://doi.org/10.1021/jacsau.1c00128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34467328/,110
