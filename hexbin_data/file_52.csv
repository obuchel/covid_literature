67,Identification of new participants in the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) oocyte maturation and ovulation processes using cDNA microarrays,2006-07-27,"BACKGROUND: The hormonal control of oocyte maturation and ovulation as well as the molecular mechanisms of nuclear maturation have been thoroughly studied in fish. In contrast, the other molecular events occurring in the ovary during post-vitellogenesis have received far less attention. METHODS: Nylon microarrays displaying 9152 rainbow trout cDNAs were hybridized using RNA samples originating from ovarian tissue collected during late vitellogenesis, post-vitellogenesis and oocyte maturation. Differentially expressed genes were identified using a statistical analysis. A supervised clustering analysis was performed using only differentially expressed genes in order to identify gene clusters exhibiting similar expression profiles. In addition, specific genes were selected and their preovulatory ovarian expression was analyzed using real-time PCR. RESULTS: From the statistical analysis, 310 differentially expressed genes were identified. Among those genes, 90 were up-regulated at the time of oocyte maturation while 220 exhibited an opposite pattern. After clustering analysis, 90 clones belonging to 3 gene clusters exhibiting the most remarkable expression patterns were kept for further analysis. Using real-time PCR analysis, we observed a strong up-regulation of ion and water transport genes such as aquaporin 4 (aqp4) and pendrin (slc26). In addition, a dramatic up-regulation of vasotocin (avt) gene was observed. Furthermore, angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ace2), coagulation factor V (cf5), adam 22, and the chemokine cxcl14 genes exhibited a sharp up-regulation at the time of oocyte maturation. Finally, ovarian aromatase (cyp19a1) exhibited a dramatic down-regulation over the post-vitellogenic period while a down-regulation of Cytidine monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (cmah) was observed at the time of oocyte maturation. CONCLUSION: We showed the over or under expression of more that 300 genes, most of them being previously unstudied or unknown in the fish preovulatory ovary. Our data confirmed the down-regulation of estrogen synthesis genes during the preovulatory period. In addition, the strong up-regulation of aqp4 and slc26 genes prior to ovulation suggests their participation in the oocyte hydration process occurring at that time. Furthermore, among the most up-regulated clones, several genes such as cxcl14, ace2, adam22, cf5 have pro-inflammatory, vasodilatory, proteolytics and coagulatory functions. The identity and expression patterns of those genes support the theory comparing ovulation to an inflammatory-like reaction.","Bobe, Julien; Montfort, Jerôme; Nguyen, Thaovi; Fostier, Alexis",Reprod Biol Endocrinol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1570352/,52
132,Simian virus 40 vectors for pulmonary gene therapy,2007-10-29,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains the leading cause of death in critically ill patients. One of the primary organs affected by sepsis is the lung, presenting as the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Organ damage in sepsis involves an alteration in gene expression, making gene transfer a potential therapeutic modality. This work examines the feasibility of applying simian virus 40 (SV40) vectors for pulmonary gene therapy. METHODS: Sepsis-induced ARDS was established by cecal ligation double puncture (2CLP). SV40 vectors carrying the luciferase reporter gene (SV/luc) were administered intratracheally immediately after sepsis induction. Sham operated (SO) as well as 2CLP rats given intratracheal PBS or adenovirus expressing luciferase served as controls. Luc transduction was evaluated by in vivo light detection, immunoassay and luciferase mRNA detection by RT-PCR in tissue harvested from septic rats. Vector abundance and distribution into alveolar cells was evaluated using immunostaining for the SV40 VP1 capsid protein as well as by double staining for VP1 and for the surfactant protein C (proSP-C). Immunostaining for T-lymphocytes was used to evaluate the cellular immune response induced by the vector. RESULTS: Luc expression measured by in vivo light detection correlated with immunoassay from lung tissue harvested from the same rats. Moreover, our results showed vector presence in type II alveolar cells. The vector did not induce significant cellular immune response. CONCLUSION: In the present study we have demonstrated efficient uptake and expression of an SV40 vector in the lungs of animals with sepsis-induced ARDS. These vectors appear to be capable of in vivo transduction of alveolar type II cells and may thus become a future therapeutic tool.","Eid, Luminita; Bromberg, Zohar; EL-Latif, Mahmoud Abd; Zeira, Evelyn; Oppenheim, Ariella; Weiss, Yoram G",Respir Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2238754/,52
256,"Remission of Invasive, Cancer Stem-Like Glioblastoma Xenografts Using Lentiviral Vector-Mediated Suicide Gene Therapy",2009-07-20,"BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma is the most frequent and most malignant primary brain tumor with a poor prognosis. The translation of therapeutic strategies for glioblastoma from the experimental phase into the clinic has been limited by insufficient animal models, which lack important features of human tumors. Lentiviral gene therapy is an attractive therapeutic option for human glioblastoma, which we validated in a clinically relevant animal model. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used a rodent xenograft model that recapitulates the invasive and angiogenic features of human glioblastoma to analyze the transduction pattern and therapeutic efficacy of lentiviral pseudotyped vectors. Both, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus glycoprotein (LCMV-GP) and vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) pseudotyped lentiviral vectors very efficiently transduced human glioblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, pseudotyped gammaretroviral vectors, similar to those evaluated for clinical therapy of glioblastoma, showed inefficient gene transfer in vitro and in vivo. Both pseudotyped lentiviral vectors transduced cancer stem-like cells characterized by their CD133-, nestin- and SOX2-expression, the ability to form spheroids in neural stem cell medium and to express astrocytic and neuronal differentiation markers under serum conditions. In a therapeutic approach using the suicide gene herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-1-tk) fused to eGFP, both lentiviral vectors mediated a complete remission of solid tumors as seen on MRI resulting in a highly significant survival benefit (p<0.001) compared to control groups. In all recurrent tumors, surviving eGFP-positive tumor cells were found, advocating prodrug application for several cycles to even enhance and prolong the therapeutic effect. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In conclusion, lentiviral pseudotyped vectors are promising candidates for gene therapy of glioma in patients. The inefficient gene delivery by gammaretroviral vectors is in line with the results obtained in clinical therapy for GBM and thus confirms the high reproducibility of the invasive glioma animal model for translational research.","Huszthy, Peter C.; Giroglou, Tsanan; Tsinkalovsky, Oleg; Euskirchen, Philipp; Skaftnesmo, Kai Ove; Bjerkvig, Rolf; von Laer, Dorothee; Miletic, Hrvoje",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2707627/,52
271,Molecular and physiologic basis of quinoline drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum malaria,2009-05-05,"30 years before the discovery of the pfcrt gene, altered cellular drug accumulation in drug-resistant malarial parasites had been well documented. Heme released from catabolized hemoglobin was thought to be a key target for quinoline drugs, and additional modifications to quinoline drug structure in order to improve activity against chloroquine-resistant malaria were performed in a few laboratories. However, parasite cell culture methods were still in their infancy, assays for drug susceptibility were not well standardized, and the power of malarial genetics was decades away. The last 10 years have witnessed explosive progress in elucidation of the biochemistry of chloroquine resistance. This review briefly summarizes that progress, and discusses where additional work is needed.","Roepe, Paul D",Future Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2724744/,52
560,The complement system,2010-09-14,"The complement system consists of a tightly regulated network of proteins that play an important role in host defense and inflammation. Complement activation results in opsonization of pathogens and their removal by phagocytes, as well as cell lysis. Inappropriate complement activation and complement deficiencies are the underlying cause of the pathophysiology of many diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and asthma. This review represents an overview of the complement system in an effort to understand the beneficial as well as harmful roles it plays during inflammatory responses.","Sarma, J.

788,High Fidelity Processing and Activation of the Human α-Defensin HNP1 Precursor by Neutrophil Elastase and Proteinase 3,2012-03-20,"The azurophilic granules of human neutrophils contain four α-defensins called human neutrophil peptides (HNPs 1–4). HNPs are tridisulfide-linked antimicrobial peptides involved in the intracellular killing of organisms phagocytosed by neutrophils. The peptides are produced as inactive precursors (proHNPs) which are processed to active microbicides by as yet unidentified convertases. ProHNP1 was expressed in E. coli and the affinity-purified propeptide isolated as two species, one containing mature HNP1 sequence with native disulfide linkages (“folded proHNP1”) and the other containing non-native disulfide linked proHNP1 conformers (misfolded proHNP1). Native HNP1, liberated by CNBr treatment of folded proHNP1, was microbicidal against Staphylococcus aureus, but the peptide derived from misfolded proHNP1 was inactive. We hypothesized that neutrophil elastase (NE), proteinase 3 (PR3) or cathepsin G (CG), serine proteases that co-localize with HNPs in azurophil granules, are proHNP1 activating convertases. Folded proHNP1 was converted to mature HNP1 by both NE and PR3, but CG generated an HNP1 variant with an N-terminal dipeptide extension. NE and PR3 cleaved folded proHNP1 to produce a peptide indistinguishable from native HNP1 purified from neutrophils, and the microbicidal activities of in vitro derived and natural HNP1 peptides were equivalent. In contrast, misfolded proHNP1 conformers were degraded extensively under the same conditions. Thus, NE and PR3 possess proHNP1 convertase activity that requires the presence of the native HNP1 disulfide motif for high fidelity activation of the precursor in vitro.","Tongaonkar, Prasad; Golji, Amir E.; Tran, Patti; Ouellette, André J.; Selsted, Michael E.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3308943/,52
903,IFN-γ Signaling to Astrocytes Protects from Autoimmune Mediated Neurological Disability,2012-07-27,"Demyelination and axonal degeneration are determinants of progressive neurological disability in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Cells resident within the central nervous system (CNS) are active participants in development, progression and subsequent control of autoimmune disease; however, their individual contributions are not well understood. Astrocytes, the most abundant CNS cell type, are highly sensitive to environmental cues and are implicated in both detrimental and protective outcomes during autoimmune demyelination. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced in transgenic mice expressing signaling defective dominant-negative interferon gamma (IFN-γ) receptors on astrocytes to determine the influence of inflammation on astrocyte activity. Inhibition of IFN-γ signaling to astrocytes did not influence disease incidence, onset, initial progression of symptoms, blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity or the composition of the acute CNS inflammatory response. Nevertheless, increased demyelination at peak acute disease in the absence of IFN-γ signaling to astrocytes correlated with sustained clinical symptoms. Following peak disease, diminished clinical remission, increased mortality and sustained astrocyte activation within the gray matter demonstrate a critical role of IFN-γ signaling to astrocytes in neuroprotection. Diminished disease remission was associated with escalating demyelination, axonal degeneration and sustained inflammation. The CNS infiltrating leukocyte composition was not altered; however, decreased IL-10 and IL-27 correlated with sustained disease. These data indicate that astrocytes play a critical role in limiting CNS autoimmune disease dependent upon a neuroprotective signaling pathway mediated by engagement of IFN-γ receptors.","Hindinger, Claudia; Bergmann, Cornelia C.; Hinton, David R.; Phares, Timothy W.; Parra, Gabriel I.; Hussain, Shabbir; Savarin, Carine; Atkinson, Roscoe D.; Stohlman, Stephen A.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3407093/,52
937,Predictive and Reactive Distribution of Vaccines and Antivirals during Cross-Regional Pandemic Outbreaks,2011-06-05,"As recently pointed out by the Institute of Medicine, the existing pandemic mitigation models lack the dynamic decision support capability. We develop a large-scale simulation-driven optimization model for generating dynamic predictive distribution of vaccines and antivirals over a network of regional pandemic outbreaks. The model incorporates measures of morbidity, mortality, and social distancing, translated into the cost of lost productivity and medical expenses. The performance of the strategy is compared to that of the reactive myopic policy, using a sample outbreak in Fla, USA, with an affected population of over four millions. The comparison is implemented at different levels of vaccine and antiviral availability and administration capacity. Sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the impact of variability of some critical factors on policy performance. The model is intended to support public health policy making for effective distribution of limited mitigation resources.","Uribe-Sánchez, Andrés; Savachkin, Alex",Influenza Res Treat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3447295/,52
1030,Natural killer cells act as rheostats modulating anti-viral T cells,2011-11-20,"Anti-viral T cells are thought to regulate whether hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV infections result in viral control, asymptomatic persistence, or severe disease, though the reasons for these different outcomes remain unclear. Recent genetic evidence, however, has indicated a correlation between certain natural killer (NK) cell receptors and progression of both HIV and HCV infection(1–3), implying that NK cells are playing a role in these T cell-associated diseases. While direct NK cell-mediated lysis of virus-infected cells may contribute to anti-viral defense during some virus infections, especially murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infections in mice and perhaps HIV in humans(4–5), NK cells have also been suspected as having immunoregulatory functions. For instance, NK cells may indirectly regulate T cell responses by lysing MCMV-infected antigen-presenting cells(6–7). In contrast to MCMV, lymphocytic choromeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice seems resistant to any direct anti-viral effects of NK cells(5,8). Here the roles of NK cells in regulating T cell-dependent viral persistence and immunopathology were examined in mice infected with LCMV, an established model for HIV and HCV infections in humans. We describe a three-way interaction, whereby activated NK cells cytolytically eliminate activated CD4 T cells that affect CD8 T-cell function and exhaustion. At high virus dose NK cells prevented fatal pathology while enabling T-cell exhaustion and viral persistence, but at a medium dose NK cells paradoxically facilitated lethal T cell-mediated pathology. Thus, NK cells can act as rheostats, regulating CD4 T cell-mediated support for the anti-viral CD8 T cells that control viral pathogenesis and persistence.","Waggoner, Stephen N.; Cornberg, Markus; Selin, Liisa K.; Welsh, Raymond M.",Nature,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3539796/,52
1034,Targeting Herpetic Keratitis by Gene Therapy,2012-12-26,"Ocular gene therapy is rapidly becoming a reality. By November 2012, approximately 28 clinical trials were approved to assess novel gene therapy agents. Viral infections such as herpetic keratitis caused by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) can cause serious complications that may lead to blindness. Recurrence of the disease is likely and cornea transplantation, therefore, might not be the ideal therapeutic solution. This paper will focus on the current situation of ocular gene therapy research against herpetic keratitis, including the use of viral and nonviral vectors, routes of delivery of therapeutic genes, new techniques, and key research strategies. Whereas the correction of inherited diseases was the initial goal of the field of gene therapy, here we discuss transgene expression, gene replacement, silencing, or clipping. Gene therapy of herpetic keratitis previously reported in the literature is screened emphasizing candidate gene therapy targets. Commonly adopted strategies are discussed to assess the relative advantages of the protective therapy using antiviral drugs and the common gene therapy against long-term HSV-1 ocular infections signs, inflammation and neovascularization. Successful gene therapy can provide innovative physiological and pharmaceutical solutions against herpetic keratitis.","Elbadawy, Hossein Mostafa; Gailledrat, Marine; Desseaux, Carole; Ponzin, Diego; Ferrari, Stefano",J Ophthalmol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3541562/,52
1046,HIV-1 Fusion Is Blocked through Binding of GB Virus C E2D Peptides to the HIV-1 gp41 Disulfide Loop,2013-01-22,"A strategy for antiviral drug discovery is the elucidation and imitation of viral interference mechanisms. HIV-1 patients benefit from a coinfection with GB Virus C (GBV-C), since HIV-positive individuals with long-term GBV-C viraemia show better survival rates than HIV-1 patients without persisting GBV-C. A direct influence of GBV-C on HIV-1 replication has been shown in coinfection experiments. GBV-C is a human non-pathogenic member of the flaviviridae family that can replicate in T and B cells. Therefore, GBV-C shares partly the same ecological niche with HIV-1. In earlier work we have demonstrated that recombinant glycoprotein E2 of GBV-C and peptides derived from the E2 N-terminus interfere with HIV entry. In this study we investigated the underlying mechanism. Performing a virus-cell fusion assay and temperature-arrested HIV-infection kinetics, we provide evidence that the HIV-inhibitory E2 peptides interfere with late HIV-1 entry steps after the engagement of gp120 with CD4 receptor and coreceptor. Binding and competition experiments revealed that the N-terminal E2 peptides bind to the disulfide loop region of HIV-1 transmembrane protein gp41. In conjunction with computational analyses, we identified sequence similarities between the N-termini of GBV-C E2 and the HIV-1 glycoprotein gp120. This similarity appears to enable the GBV-C E2 N-terminus to interact with the HIV-1 gp41 disulfide loop, a crucial domain involved in the gp120-gp41 interface. Furthermore, the results of the present study provide initial proof of concept that peptides targeted to the gp41 disulfide loop are able to inhibit HIV fusion and should inspire the development of this new class of HIV-1 entry inhibitors.","Eissmann, Kristin; Mueller, Sebastian; Sticht, Heinrich; Jung, Susan; Zou, Peng; Jiang, Shibo; Gross, Andrea; Eichler, Jutta; Fleckenstein, Bernhard; Reil, Heide",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3551756/,52
1198,Dendritic Cell Immunoreceptor Is a New Target for Anti-AIDS Drug Development: Identification of DCIR/HIV-1 Inhibitors,2013-07-09,"The HIV-1 pandemic continues to expand while no effective vaccine or cure is yet available. Existing therapies have managed to limit mortality and control viral proliferation, but are associated with side effects, do not cure the disease and are subject to development of resistance. Finding new therapeutic targets and drugs is therefore crucial. We have previously shown that the dendritic cell immunoreceptor (DCIR), a C-type lectin receptor expressed on dendritic cells (DCs), acts as an attachment factor for HIV-1 to DCs and contributes to HIV-1 transmission to CD4(+) T lymphocytes (CD4TL). Directly involved in HIV-1 infection, DCIR is expressed in apoptotic or infected CD4TL and promotes trans-infection to bystander cells. Here we report the 3D modelling of the extracellular domain of DCIR. Based on this structure, two surface accessible pockets containing the carbohydrate recognition domain and the EPS binding motif, respectively, were targeted for screening of chemicals that will disrupt normal interaction with HIV-1 particle. Preliminary screening using Raji-CD4-DCIR cells allowed identification of two inhibitors that decreased HIV-1 attachment and propagation. The impact of these inhibitors on infection of DCs and CD4TL was evaluated as well. The results of this study thus identify novel molecules capable of blocking HIV-1 transmission by DCs and CD4TL.","Lambert, Alexandra A.; Azzi, Arezki; Lin, Sheng-Xiang; Allaire, Geneviève; St-Gelais, Karianne P.; Tremblay, Michel J.; Gilbert, Caroline",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3706466/,52
1206,Human mobility and the worldwide impact of intentional localized highly pathogenic virus release,2013-07-17,"The threat of bioterrorism and the possibility of accidental release have spawned a growth of interest in modeling the course of the release of a highly pathogenic agent. Studies focused on strategies to contain local outbreaks after their detection show that timely interventions with vaccination and contact tracing are able to halt transmission. However, such studies do not consider the effects of human mobility patterns. Using a large-scale structured metapopulation model to simulate the global spread of smallpox after an intentional release event, we show that index cases and potential outbreaks can occur in different continents even before the detection of the pathogen release. These results have two major implications: i) intentional release of a highly pathogenic agent within a country will have global effects; ii) the release event may trigger outbreaks in countries lacking the health infrastructure necessary for effective containment. The presented study provides data with potential uses in defining contingency plans at the National and International level.","Gonçalves, Bruno; Balcan, Duygu; Vespignani, Alessandro",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3713588/,52
1259,Role of S-Palmitoylation on IFITM5 for the Interaction with FKBP11 in Osteoblast Cells,2013-09-18,"Recently, one of the interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) family proteins, IFITM3, has become an important target for the activity against influenza A (H1N1) virus infection. In this protein, a post-translational modification by fatty acids covalently attached to cysteine, termed S-palmitoylation, plays a crucial role for the antiviral activity. IFITM3 possesses three cysteine residues for the S-palmitoylation in the first transmembrane (TM1) domain and in the cytoplasmic (CP) loop. Because these cysteines are well conserved in the mammalian IFITM family proteins, the S-palmitoylation on these cysteines is significant for their functions. IFITM5 is another IFITM family protein and interacts with the FK506-binding protein 11 (FKBP11) to form a higher-order complex in osteoblast cells, which induces the expression of immunologically relevant genes. In this study, we investigated the role played by S-palmitoylation of IFITM5 in its interaction with FKBP11 in the cells, because this interaction is a key process for the gene expression. Our investigations using an established reporter, 17-octadecynoic acid (17-ODYA), and an inhibitor for the S-palmitoylation, 2-bromopalmitic acid (2BP), revealed that IFITM5 was S-palmitoylated in addition to IFITM3. Specifically, we found that cysteine residues in the TM1 domain and in the CP loop were S-palmitoylated in IFITM5. Then, we revealed by immunoprecipitation and western blot analyses that the interaction of IFITM5 with FKBP11 was inhibited in the presence of 2BP. The mutant lacking the S-palmitoylation site in the TM1 domain lost the interaction with FKBP11. These results indicate that the S-palmitoylation on IFITM5 promotes the interaction with FKBP11. Finally, we investigated bone nodule formation in osteoblast cells in the presence of 2BP, because IFITM5 was originally identified as a bone formation factor. The experiment resulted in a morphological aberration of the bone nodule. This also indicated that the S-palmitoylation contributes to bone formation.","Tsukamoto, Takashi; Li, Xianglan; Morita, Hiromi; Minowa, Takashi; Aizawa, Tomoyasu; Hanagata, Nobutaka; Demura, Makoto",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3776769/,52

Several studies have confirmed that SOCS3 is increased in asthmatic patients, and SOCS3 expression is correlated with disease severity. The objective of this study was to evaluate if delivering of SOCS3 short interfering RNA (siRNA) intranasally in lungs could be a good therapeutic approach in an asthma chronic mouse model. Our results showed that intranasal treatment with SOCS3-siRNA led to an improvement in the eosinophil count and the normalization of hyperresponsiveness to methacholine. Concomitantly, this treatment resulted in an improvement in mucus secretion, a reduction in lung collagen, which are prominent features of airway remodeling. The mechanism implies JAK/STAT and RhoA/Rho-kinase signaling pathway, because we found a decreasing in STAT3 phosphorylation status and down regulation of RhoA/Rho-kinase protein expression. These results might lead to a new therapy for the treatment of chronic asthma.","Mazzeo, Carla; Gámez, Cristina; Rodriguez Marco, Ainara; de Zulueta, Ana; Sanz, Veronica; Bilbao, Izaskun; Ruiz-Cabello, Jesús; Zubeldia, Jose M.; del Pozo, Victoria",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3956882/,52
1471,Building Cell Selectivity into CPP-Mediated Strategies,2010-05-14,"There is a pressing need for more effective and selective therapies for cancer and other diseases. Consequently, much effort is being devoted to the development of alternative experimental approaches based on selective systems, which are designed to be specifically directed against target cells. In addition, a large number of highly potent therapeutic molecules are being discovered. However, they do not reach clinical trials because of their low delivery, poor specificity or their incapacity to bypass the plasma membrane. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are an open door for cell-impermeable compounds to reach intracellular targets. Putting all these together, research is sailing in the direction of the design of systems with the capacity to transport new drugs into a target cell. Some CPPs show cell type specificity while others require modifications or form part of more sophisticated drug delivery systems. In this review article we summarize several strategies for directed drug delivery involving CPPs that have been reported in the literature.","Martín, Irene; Teixidó, Meritxell; Giralt, Ernest",Pharmaceuticals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4033992/,52
1527,Advances in Diagnosis of Respiratory Diseases of Small Ruminants,2014-06-15,"Irrespective of aetiology, infectious respiratory diseases of sheep and goats contribute to 5.6 percent of the total diseases of small ruminants.

1568,Early-Life Hepatitis E Infection in Pigs: The Importance of Maternally-Derived Antibodies,2014-08-21,"Passive immunity (PI), acquired through colostrum intake, is essential for piglet protection against pathogens. Maternally-derived antibodies (MDAs) can decrease the transmission of pathogens between individuals by reducing shedding from infected animals and/or susceptibility of naïve animals. Only a limited number of studies, however, have been carried out to quantify the level of protection conferred by PI in terms of transmission. In the present study, an original modeling framework was designed to estimate parameters governing the transmission of infectious agents in the presence and absence of PI. This epidemiological model accounts for the distribution of PI duration and two different forces of infection depending on the serological status of animals after colostrum intake. A Bayesian approach (Metropolis-Hastings algorithm) was used for parameter estimation. The impact of PI on hepatitis E virus transmission in piglets was investigated using longitudinal serological data from six pig farms. A strong impact of PI was highlighted, the efficiency of transmission being on average 13 times lower in piglets with maternally-derived antibodies than in fully susceptible animals (range: 5–21). Median infection-free survival ages, based on herd-specific estimates, ranged between 8.7 and 13.8 weeks in all but one herd. Indeed, this herd exhibited a different profile with a relatively low prevalence of infected pigs (50% at slaughter age) despite the similar proportions of passively immune individuals after colostrum intake. These results suggest that the age at HEV infection is not strictly dependent upon the proportion of piglets with PI but is also linked to farm-specific husbandry (mingling of piglets after weaning) and hygiene practices. The original methodology developed here, using population-based longitudinal serological data, was able to demonstrate the relative impact of MDAs on the transmission of infectious agents.","Andraud, Mathieu; Casas, Maribel; Pavio, Nicole; Rose, Nicolas",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4140806/,52
1573,ERKs and mitochondria-related pathways are essential for glycyrrhizic acid-mediated neuroprotection against glutamate-induced toxicity in differentiated PC12 cells,2014-07-25,"The present study focuses on the neuroprotective effect of glycyrrhizic acid (GA, a major compound separated from Glycyrrhiza Radix, which is a crude Chinese traditional drug) against glutamate-induced cytotoxicity in differentiated PC12 (DPC12) cells. The results showed that GA treatment improved cell viability and ameliorated abnormal glutamate-induced alterations in mitochondria in DPC12 cells. GA reversed glutamate-suppressed B-cell lymphoma 2 levels, inhibited glutamate-enhanced expressions of Bax and cleaved caspase 3, and reduced cytochrome C (Cyto C) release. Exposure to glutamate strongly inhibited phosphorylation of AKT (protein kinase B) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs); however, GA pretreatment enhanced activation of ERKs but not AKT. The presence of PD98059 (a mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase [MEK] inhibitor) but not LY294002 (a phosphoinositide 3-kinase [PI3K] inhibitor) diminished the potency of GA for improving viability of glutamate-exposed DPC12 cells. These results indicated that ERKs and mitochondria-related pathways are essential for the neuroprotective effect of GA against glutamate-induced toxicity in DPC12 cells. The present study provides experimental evidence supporting GA as a potential therapeutic agent for use in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.","Wang, D.; Guo, T.Q.; Wang, Z.Y.; Lu, J.H.; Liu, D.P.; Meng, Q.F.; Xie, J.; Zhang, X.L.; Liu, Y.; Teng, L.S.",Braz J Med Biol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4143205/,52
1823,"Dieckol, a Component of Ecklonia cava, Suppresses the Production of MDC/CCL22 via Down-Regulating STAT1 Pathway in Interferon-γ Stimulated HaCaT Human Keratinocytes",2015-05-01,"Macrophage-derived chemokine, C-C motif chemokine 22 (MDC/CCL22), is one of the inflammatory chemokines that controls the movement of monocytes, monocyte-derived dendritic cells, and natural killer cells. Serum and skin MDC/CCL22 levels are elevated in atopic dermatitis, which suggests that the chemokines produced from keratinocytes are responsible for attracting inflammatory lymphocytes to the skin. A major signaling pathway in the interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-stimulated inflammation response involves the signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1). In the present study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of dieckol and its possible action mechanisms in the category of skin inflammation including atopic dermatitis. Dieckol inhibited MDC/CCL22 production induced by IFN-γ (10 ng/mL) in a dose dependent manner. Dieckol (5 and 10 μM) suppressed the phosphorylation and the nuclear translocation of STAT1. These results suggest that dieckol exhibits anti-inflammatory effect via the down-regulation of STAT1 activation.","Kang, Na-Jin; Koo, Dong-Hwan; Kang, Gyeoung-Jin; Han, Sang-Chul; Lee, Bang-Won; Koh, Young-Sang; Hyun, Jin-Won; Lee, Nam-Ho; Ko, Mi-Hee; Kang, Hee-Kyoung; Yoo, Eun-Sook",Biomol Ther (Seoul),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4428716/,52
1826,Environmental Conditions Affect Exhalation of H3N2 Seasonal and Variant Influenza Viruses and Respiratory Droplet Transmission in Ferrets,2015-05-13,"The seasonality of influenza virus infections in temperate climates and the role of environmental conditions like temperature and humidity in the transmission of influenza virus through the air are not well understood. Using ferrets housed at four different environmental conditions, we evaluated the respiratory droplet transmission of two influenza viruses (a seasonal H3N2 virus and an H3N2 variant virus, the etiologic virus of a swine to human summertime infection) and concurrently characterized the aerosol shedding profiles of infected animals. Comparisons were made among the different temperature and humidity conditions and between the two viruses to determine if the H3N2 variant virus exhibited enhanced capabilities that may have contributed to the infections occurring in the summer. We report here that although increased levels of H3N2 variant virus were found in ferret nasal wash and exhaled aerosol samples compared to the seasonal H3N2 virus, enhanced respiratory droplet transmission was not observed under any of the environmental settings. However, overall environmental conditions were shown to modulate the frequency of influenza virus transmission through the air. Transmission occurred most frequently at 23°C/30%RH, while the levels of infectious virus in aerosols exhaled by infected ferrets agree with these results. Improving our understanding of how environmental conditions affect influenza virus infectivity and transmission may reveal ways to better protect the public against influenza virus infections.","Gustin, Kortney M.; Belser, Jessica A.; Veguilla, Vic; Zeng, Hui; Katz, Jacqueline M.; Tumpey, Terrence M.; Maines, Taronna R.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4430532/,52
1899,Identification of Glial Activation Markers by Comparison of Transcriptome Changes between Astrocytes and Microglia following Innate Immune Stimulation,2015-07-27,"The activation of astrocytes and microglia is often associated with diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Understanding how activation alters the transcriptome of these cells may offer valuable insight regarding how activation of these cells mediate neurological damage. Furthermore, identifying common and unique pathways of gene expression during activation may provide new insight into the distinct roles these cells have in the CNS during infection and inflammation. Since recent studies indicate that TLR7 recognizes not only viral RNA but also microRNAs that are released by damaged neurons and elevated during neurological diseases, we first examined the response of glial cells to TLR7 stimulation using microarray analysis. Microglia were found to generate a much stronger response to TLR7 activation than astrocytes, both in the number of genes induced as well as fold induction. Although the primary pathways induced by both cell types were directly linked to immune responses, microglia also induced pathways associated with cellular proliferation, while astrocytes did not. Targeted analysis of a subset of the upregulated genes identified unique mRNA, including Ifi202b which was only upregulated by microglia and was found to be induced during both retroviral and bunyavirus infections in the CNS. In addition, other genes including Birc3 and Gpr84 as well as two expressed sequences AW112010 and BC023105 were found to be induced in both microglia and astrocytes and were upregulated in the CNS following virus infection. Thus, expression of these genes may a useful measurement of glial activation during insult or injury to the CNS.","Madeddu, Silvia; Woods, Tyson A.; Mukherjee, Piyali; Sturdevant, Dan; Butchi, Niranjan B.; Peterson, Karin E.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4516330/,52
1910,Preclinical safety and tolerability of a repeatedly administered human leishmaniasis DNA vaccine,2015-04-30,"The leishmaniases are a complex of vector-borne diseases caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania. LEISHDNAVAX is a multi-antigen, T-cell epitope-enriched DNA vaccine candidate against human leishmaniasis. The vaccine candidate has been proven immunogenic and showed prophylactic efficacy in preclinical studies. Here, we describe the safety testing of LEISHDNAVAX in naive mice and rats, complemented by the demonstration of tolerability in Leishmania-infected mice. Biodistribution and persistence were examined following single and repeated intradermal (i.d.) administration to rats. DNA vectors were distributed systemically but did not accumulate upon repeated injections. Although vector DNA was cleared from most other tissues within 60 days after the last injection, it persisted in skin at the site of injection and in draining lymph nodes. Evaluation of single-dose and repeated-dose toxicity of the vaccine candidate after i.d. administration to naive, non-infected mice did not reveal any safety concerns. LEISHDNAVAX was also well tolerated in Leishmania-infected mice. Taken together, our results substantiate a favorable safety profile of LEISHDNAVAX in both naive and infected animals and thus, support the initiation of clinical trials for both preventive and therapeutic applications of the vaccine.","Riede, O; Seifert, K; Oswald, D; Endmann, A; Hock, C; Winkler, A; Salguero, F J; Schroff, M; Croft, S L; Juhls, C",Gene Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4530203/,52

In China, plants have been used in traditional medicine for thousands of years. Recent development of molecular biology, genomics and functional genomics as well as high-throughput analytical chemical technologies has greatly promoted the research on medicinal plants. In this article, we review recent advances in the elucidation of biosynthesis of specialized metabolites in medicinal plants, including phenylpropanoids, terpenoids and alkaloids. These natural products may share a common upstream pathway to form a limited numbers of common precursors, but are characteristic in distinct modifications leading to highly variable structures. Although this review is focused on traditional Chinese medicine, other plants with a great medicinal interest or potential are also discussed. Understanding of their biosynthesis processes is critical for producing these highly value molecules at large scale and low cost in microbes and will benefit to not only human health but also plant resource conservation.","Yang, Lei; Yang, Changqing; Li, Chenyi; Zhao, Qing; Liu, Ling; Fang, Xin; Chen, Xiao-Ya",Sci Bull (Beijing),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4722072/,52
2108,Natural Pig Plasma Immunoglobulins Have Anti-Bacterial Effects: Potential for Use as Feed Supplement for Treatment of Intestinal Infections in Pigs,2016-01-29,"There is an increasing demand for non-antibiotics solutions to control infectious disease in intensive pig production. Here, one such alternative, namely pig antibodies purified from slaughterhouse blood was investigated in order to elucidate its potential usability to control post-weaning diarrhoea (PWD), which is one of the top indications for antibiotics usage in the pig production. A very cost-efficient and rapid one-step expanded bed adsorption (EBA) chromatography procedure was used to purify pig immunoglobulin G from slaughterhouse pig plasma (more than 100 litres), resulting in >85% pure pig IgG (ppIgG). The ppIgG thus comprised natural pig immunoglobulins and was subsequently shown to contain activity towards four pig-relevant bacterial strains (three different types of Escherichia coli and one type of Salmonella enterica) but not towards a fish pathogen (Yersinia ruckeri), and was demonstrated to inhibit the binding of the four pig relevant bacteria to a pig intestinal cell line (IPEC-J2). Finally it was demonstrated in an in vivo weaning piglet model for intestinal colonization with an E. coli F4+ challenge strain that ppIgG given in the feed significantly reduced shedding of the challenge strain, reduced the proportion of the bacterial family Enterobacteriaceae, increased the proportion of families Enterococcoceae and Streptococcaceae and generally increased ileal microbiota diversity. Conclusively, our data support the idea that natural IgG directly purified from pig plasma and given as a feed supplement can be used in modern swine production as an efficient and cost-effective means for reducing both occurrence of PWD and antibiotics usage and with a potential for the prevention and treatment of other intestinal infectious diseases even if the causative agent might not be known.","Hedegaard, Chris J.; Strube, Mikael L.; Hansen, Marie B.; Lindved, Bodil K.; Lihme, Allan; Boye, Mette; Heegaard, Peter M.

2117,Discovery of an antibody for pan-ebolavirus therapy,2016-02-10,"During the latest outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa, monoclonal antibody therapy (e.g., ZMapp) was utilized to treat patients. However, due to the antigenic differences among the five ebolavirus species, the current therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are only effective against viruses of the species Zaire ebolavirus. Although this particular species has indeed caused the majority of human infections in Central and, recently, West Africa, other ebolavirus species (e.g., Sudan ebolavirus and Bundibugyo ebolavirus) have also repeatedly caused outbreaks in Central Africa and thus should not be neglected in the development of countermeasures against ebolaviruses. Here we report the generation of an ebolavirus glycoprotein-specific monoclonal antibody that effectively inhibits cellular entry of representative isolates of all known ebolavirus species in vitro and show its protective efficacy in mouse models of ebolavirus infections. This novel neutralizing monoclonal antibody targets a highly conserved internal fusion loop in the glycoprotein molecule and prevents membrane fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membranes. The discovery of this highly cross-neutralizing antibody provides a promising option for broad-acting ebolavirus antibody therapy and will accelerate the design of improved vaccines that can selectively elicit cross-neutralizing antibodies against multiple species of ebolaviruses.","Furuyama, Wakako; Marzi, Andrea; Nanbo, Asuka; Haddock, Elaine; Maruyama, Junki; Miyamoto, Hiroko; Igarashi, Manabu; Yoshida, Reiko; Noyori, Osamu; Feldmann, Heinz; Takada, Ayato",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4748290/,52
2288,Small Glutamine-Rich Tetratricopeptide Repeat-Containing Protein Alpha (SGTA) Ablation Limits Offspring Viability and Growth in Mice,2016-06-30,"Small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein α (SGTA) has been implicated as a co-chaperone and regulator of androgen and growth hormone receptor (AR, GHR) signalling. We investigated the functional consequences of partial and full Sgta ablation in vivo using Cre-lox Sgta-null mice. Sgta(+/−) breeders generated viable Sgta(−/−) offspring, but at less than Mendelian expectancy. Sgta(−/−) breeders were subfertile with small litters and higher neonatal death (P < 0.02). Body size was significantly and proportionately smaller in male and female Sgta(−/−) (vs WT, Sgta(+/−) P < 0.001) from d19. Serum IGF-1 levels were genotype- and sex-dependent. Food intake, muscle and bone mass and adiposity were unchanged in Sgta(−/−). Vital and sex organs had normal relative weight, morphology and histology, although certain androgen-sensitive measures such as penis and preputial size, and testis descent, were greater in Sgta(−/−). Expression of AR and its targets remained largely unchanged, although AR localisation was genotype- and tissue-dependent. Generally expression of other TPR-containing proteins was unchanged. In conclusion, this thorough investigation of SGTA-null mutation reports a mild phenotype of reduced body size. The model’s full potential likely will be realised by genetic crosses with other models to interrogate the role of SGTA in the many diseases in which it has been implicated.","Philp, Lisa K.; Day, Tanya K.; Butler, Miriam S.; Laven-Law, Geraldine; Jindal, Shalini; Hickey, Theresa E.; Scher, Howard I.; Butler, Lisa M.; Tilley, Wayne D.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4928056/,52
2299,Interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary hypertension associated with suspected ehrlichiosis in a dog,2016-07-07,"BACKGROUND: In dogs with canine monocytic ehrlichiosis (CME), respiratory signs are uncommon and clinical and radiographic signs of interstitial pneumonia are poorly described. However, in human monocytic ehrlichiosis, respiratory signs are common and signs of interstitial pneumonia are well known. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is classified based on the underlying disease and its treatment is aimed at reducing the clinical signs and, if possible, addressing the primary disease process. PH is often irreversible, but can be reversible if it is secondary to a treatable underlying etiology. CME is currently not generally recognized as one of the possible diseases leading to interstitial pneumonia and secondary PH in dogs. Only one case of PH associated with CME has been reported worldwide. CASE PRESENTATION: A seven-year-old, male intact, mixed breed dog was presented with 2 weeks history of lethargy and dyspnea. The dog previously lived in the Cape Verdean islands. Physical examination showed signs of right-sided congestive heart failure and poor peripheral perfusion. Thoracic radiography showed moderate right-sided cardiomegaly with dilation of the main pulmonary artery and a mild diffuse interstitial lung pattern with peribronchial cuffing. Echocardiography showed severe pulmonary hypertension with an estimated pressure gradient of 136 mm Hg. On arterial blood gas analysis, severe hypoxemia was found and complete blood count revealed moderate regenerative anemia and severe thrombocytopenia. A severe gamma hyperglobulinemia was also documented. Serology for Ehrlichia canis was highly positive. Treatment with oxygen supplementation, a typed packed red blood cell transfusion and medical therapy with doxycycline, pimobendan and sildenafil was initiated and the dog improved clinically. Approximately 2 weeks later, there was complete resolution of all clinical signs and marked improvement of the PH. CONCLUSION: This report illustrates that CME might be associated with significant pulmonary disease and should be considered as a possible differential diagnosis in dogs presenting with dyspnea and secondary pulmonary hypertension, especially in dogs that have been in endemic areas. This is important because CME is a treatable disease and its secondary lung and cardiac manifestations may be completely reversible.","Toom, Marjolein Lisette den; Dobak, Tetyda Paulina; Broens, Els Marion; Valtolina, Chiara",Acta Vet Scand,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4937533/,52
2338,Local Innate Responses to TLR Ligands in the Chicken Trachea,2016-07-22,"The chicken upper respiratory tract is the portal of entry for respiratory pathogens, such as avian influenza virus (AIV). The presence of microorganisms is sensed by pathogen recognition receptors (such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs)) of the innate immune defenses. Innate responses are essential for subsequent induction of potent adaptive immune responses, but little information is available about innate antiviral responses of the chicken trachea. We hypothesized that TLR ligands induce innate antiviral responses in the chicken trachea. Tracheal organ cultures (TOC) were used to investigate localized innate responses to TLR ligands. Expression of candidate genes, which play a role in antiviral responses, was quantified. To confirm the antiviral responses of stimulated TOC, chicken macrophages were treated with supernatants from stimulated TOC, prior to infection with AIV. The results demonstrated that TLR ligands induced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, type I interferons and interferon stimulated genes in the chicken trachea. In conclusion, TLR ligands induce functional antiviral responses in the chicken trachea, which may act against some pathogens, such as AIV.","Barjesteh, Neda; Alkie, Tamiru Negash; Hodgins, Douglas C.; Nagy, Éva; Sharif, Shayan",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4974541/,52
2409,Viral Inhibition of the IFN-Induced JAK/STAT Signalling Pathway: Development of Live Attenuated Vaccines by Mutation of Viral-Encoded IFN-Antagonists,2016-06-29,"The interferon (IFN) induced anti-viral response is amongst the earliest and most potent of the innate responses to fight viral infection. The induction of the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activation of transcription (JAK/STAT) signalling pathway by IFNs leads to the upregulation of hundreds of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) for which, many have the ability to rapidly kill viruses within infected cells. During the long course of evolution, viruses have evolved an extraordinary range of strategies to counteract the host immune responses in particular by targeting the JAK/STAT signalling pathway. Understanding how the IFN system is inhibited has provided critical insights into viral virulence and pathogenesis. Moreover, identification of factors encoded by viruses that modulate the JAK/STAT pathway has opened up opportunities to create new anti-viral drugs and rationally attenuated new generation vaccines, particularly for RNA viruses, by reverse genetics.","Fleming, Stephen B.",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5041017/,52
2472,Ehrlichia secretes Etf-1 to induce autophagy and capture nutrients for its growth through RAB5 and class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase,2016-08-19,"Ehrlichia chaffeensis is an obligatory intracellular bacterium that causes a potentially fatal emerging zoonosis, human monocytic ehrlichiosis. E. chaffeensis has a limited capacity for biosynthesis and metabolism and thus depends mostly on host-synthesized nutrients for growth. Although the host cell cytoplasm is rich with these nutrients, as E. chaffeensis is confined within the early endosome-like membrane-bound compartment, only host nutrients that enter the compartment can be used by this bacterium. How this occurs is unknown. We found that ehrlichial replication depended on autophagy induction involving class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K) activity, BECN1 (Beclin 1), and ATG5 (autophagy-related 5). Ehrlichia acquired host cell preincorporated amino acids in a class III PtdIns3K-dependent manner and ehrlichial growth was enhanced by treatment with rapamycin, an autophagy inducer. Moreover, ATG5 and RAB5A/B/C were routed to ehrlichial inclusions. RAB5A/B/C siRNA knockdown, or overexpression of a RAB5-specific GTPase-activating protein or dominant-negative RAB5A inhibited ehrlichial infection, indicating the critical role of GTP-bound RAB5 during infection. Both native and ectopically expressed ehrlichial type IV secretion effector protein, Etf-1, bound RAB5 and the autophagy-initiating class III PtdIns3K complex, PIK3C3/VPS34, and BECN1, and homed to ehrlichial inclusions. Ectopically expressed Etf-1 activated class III PtdIns3K as in E. chaffeensis infection and induced autophagosome formation, cleared an aggregation-prone mutant huntingtin protein in a class III PtdIns3K-dependent manner, and enhanced ehrlichial proliferation. These data support the notion that E. chaffeensis secretes Etf-1 to induce autophagy to repurpose the host cytoplasm and capture nutrients for its growth through RAB5 and class III PtdIns3K, while avoiding autolysosomal killing.","Lin, Mingqun; Liu, Hongyan; Xiong, Qingming; Niu, Hua; Cheng, Zhihui; Yamamoto, Akitsugu; Rikihisa, Yasuko",Autophagy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5103349/,52
2545,Sec16A is critical for both conventional and unconventional secretion of CFTR,2017-01-09,"CFTR is a transmembrane protein that reaches the cell surface via the conventional Golgi mediated secretion pathway. Interestingly, ER-to-Golgi blockade or ER stress induces alternative GRASP-mediated, Golgi-bypassing unconventional trafficking of wild-type CFTR and the disease-causing ΔF508-CFTR, which has folding and trafficking defects. Here, we show that Sec16A, the key regulator of conventional ER-to-Golgi transport, plays a critical role in the ER exit of protein cargos during unconventional secretion. In an initial gene silencing screen, Sec16A knockdown abolished the unconventional secretion of wild-type and ΔF508-CFTR induced by ER-to-Golgi blockade, whereas the knockdown of other COPII-related components did not. Notably, during unconventional secretion, Sec16A was redistributed to cell periphery and associated with GRASP55 in mammalian cells. Molecular and morphological analyses revealed that IRE1α-mediated signaling is an upstream regulator of Sec16A during ER-to-Golgi blockade or ER stress associated unconventional secretion. These findings highlight a novel function of Sec16A as an essential mediator of ER stress-associated unconventional secretion.","Piao, He; Kim, Jiyoon; Noh, Shin Hye; Kweon, Hee-Seok; Kim, Joo Young; Lee, Min Goo",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5220342/,52
2633,The nasopharyngeal microbiota of beef cattle before and after transport to a feedlot,2017-03-22,"BACKGROUND: The nasopharyngeal (NP) microbiota plays an important role in bovine health, comprising a rich and diverse microbial community. The nasopharynx is also the niche for potentially pathogenic agents which are associated with bovine respiratory disease (BRD), a serious and costly illness in feedlot cattle. We used 14 beef heifers from a closed and disease-free herd to assess the dynamics of the NP microbiota of cattle that are transported to a feedlot. Cattle were sampled prior to transport to the feedlot (day 0) and at days 2, 7, and 14. RESULTS: The structure of the NP microbiota changed significantly over the course of the study, with the largest shift occurring between day 0 (prior to transport) and day 2 (P < 0.001). Phylogenetic diversity and richness increased following feedlot placement (day 2; P < 0.05). The genera Pasteurella, Bacillus, and Proteus were enriched at day 0, Streptococcus and Acinetobacter at day 2, Bifidobacterium at day 7, and Mycoplasma at day 14. The functional potential of the NP microbiota was assessed using PICRUSt, revealing that replication and repair, as well as translation pathways, were more relatively abundant in day 14 samples. These differences were driven mostly by Mycoplasma. Although eight cattle were culture-positive for the BRD-associated bacterium Pasteurella multocida at one or more sampling times, none were culture-positive for Mannheimia haemolytica or Histophilus somni. CONCLUSIONS: This study investigated the effect that feedlot placement has on the NP microbiota of beef cattle over a 14-d period. Within two days of transport to the feedlot, the NP microbiota changed significantly, increasing in both phylogenetic diversity and richness. These results demonstrate that there is an abrupt shift in the NP microbiota of cattle after transportation to a feedlot. This may have importance for understanding why cattle are most susceptible to BRD after feedlot placement.

However, the fundamental roles MAGE-G1 played in neurogenesis have not yet been completely understood. Finding the partners MAGE-G1 interacting with will surely contribute to the function study of MAGE-G1. In this study, using Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino acids in Cell culture-immunoprecipitation quantitative proteomics, we screened the interacting proteins of MAGE-G1 during retinoic acid -induced neuronal differentiation of P19 cells and firstly found that FSCN1 and VIME were potential novel MAGE-G1-interacting proteins. Then, the interaction between overexpressed MAGE-G1 and FSCN1 or VIME was validated by GST-pull down assay in bacteria and by co-immunoprecipitation assay in COS7 cells. Endogenous co-immunoprecipitation assay further confirmed that MAGE-G1 interacted with FSCN1 or VIME in P19 cells after a 6-day retinoic acid-induced neuronal differentiation. Those results provide a functional linkage between MAGE-G1 and FSCN1 or VIME and may facilitate a better understanding of the fundamental aspects of MAGE-G1 during neurogenesis.","Liu, Yong; Chen, Yujian; Lin, Shide; Yang, Shuguang; Liu, Shaojun",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5379670/,52

Specially, establishing whether invasive species operate within the constraint of conservative ecological niches, or if niche shifts occur at all commonly as part of the invasion process, is indispensable to identifying and anticipating potential areas of invasion. Ecological niche modeling (ENM) has been used to address such questions, but improvements and debate in study design, model evaluation, and methods are still needed to mature this field. We reanalyze data for Gray Squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis), native to North America, but invasive in Europe. Our main finding was that, when the analysis extent is established carefully based on analogous sets of environmental conditions, all evidence of niche shifts disappears, suggesting that previous reports of niche shifts for this species are artifacts of methods and interpretation, rather than biological reality. Niche conservatism should be tested only within appropriate, similar, environmental spaces that are accessible to both species or populations being compared, thus avoiding model extrapolation related to model transfers. Testing for environmental similarity between native and invaded areas is critical to identifying niche shifts during species invasion robustly, but also in applications of ENM to understanding temporal dimensions of niche dynamics.","Qiao, Huijie; Escobar, Luis E.; Peterson, A.

2724,Antigen-Sparing and Enhanced Efficacy of Multivalent Vaccines Adjuvanted with Immunopotentiators in Chickens,2017-05-26,"We previously described that immunopotentiators, CVCVA5, increased the efficacy of H5 and H9 subtype avian influenza vaccines in chickens, ducks, and geese. In this study, we further investigated the effects of the CVCVA5 for improving the efficacy of other univalent or multivalent inactivated vaccines. The immune response administrated with half-dose of monovalent vaccine plus CVCVA5 were higher than those of one dose of monovalent vaccine without immunopotentiators as measured by levels of antibodies from serum, tears and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, and cytokines of IFNγ and IL-4 from serum. Vaccines included the univalent vaccine of Newcastle Disease virus (ND), Egg Drop Syndrome virus (EDS), Infectious Bronchitis virus (IB), and Infectious Bursal Disease virus (IBD). The CVCVA5 also improved the immune response of both ND and IBD vaccines with less dosage. The sterile protective immunity was monitored with one- or a half-dose of adjuvanted ND vaccine or one dose of adjuvanted IBD vaccine, respectively. The improved immune efficacy was observed in a half-dose of adjuvanted bivalent vaccines compared to one dose of vaccines without CVCVA5 as measured by the antibody levels, including bivalent vaccine of ND-H9, ND-IB, and ND-IBD. The CVCVA5 also boosted the immune efficacy of the tetravalent vaccine (ND-IB-EDS-H9). A half-dose of adjuvanted commercial vaccine or 75% antigen-sparing adjuvanted vaccine elicited similar antibody levels to those of one dose non-adjuvanted commercial vaccines. The CVCVA5 improved the effect of a booster vaccination as measured by the antibody levels against H5 or H9 virus antigens, in which chickens primed with the adjuvanted ND-IB vaccines given a booster with H5–H9 bivalent vaccines without CVCVA5 using 5-day intervals. The inflammatory response may contribute to these additional effects by increasing the levels of IFNγ and IL-4 after the injection of the adjuvanted ND-IB vaccines. Results indicated that the CVCVA5 improved the serum and mucosal antibody levels, cytokine levels of the chickens given the univalent vaccine, and also improved serum antibody titers in bivalent and tetravalent vaccines. This has a potential as an improve vaccine.","Wu, Peipei; Lu, Jihu; Feng, Lei; Wu, Hongzhuan; Zhang, Xuehua; Mei, Mei; Hou, Jibo; Liu, Xiufan; Tang, Yinghua",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5445108/,52
2746,An anti vimentin antibody promotes tube formation,2017-06-15,"In recent years, there has been an increasing appreciation of the importance of secreted and extracellular proteins that traditionally have been considered as intracellular components. Vimentin is a highly abundant intermediate filament protein, and its intracellular functions have been investigated in a large number of studies. Recently, however, vimentin has been shown to take part in significant processes outside the cell. Our understanding of the functions of extracellular vimentin is, however, limited. In this study we demonstrate that a vimentin specific antibody, obtained by phage antibody technology, promotes tube formation of endothelial cells in a 2D matrigel assay. By binding vimentin, the antibody increases the tube formation by 21% after 5 hours of incubation. Addition of the antibody directly to cultured endothelial cells does not influence endothelial cell migration or proliferation. The enhanced tube formation can be seen for up to 10 hours where after the effect decreases. It is shown that the antibody-binding site is located on the coil 2 domain of vimentin. To our knowledge this is the first study that demonstrates an enhanced tube formation by binding vimentin in a 2D matrigel assay under normoxic conditions.","Jørgensen, Mathias Lindh; Møller, Carina Kjeldahl; Rasmussen, Lasse; Boisen, Louise; Pedersen, Henrik; Kristensen, Peter",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5472577/,52
2829,Galangin suppresses human laryngeal carcinoma via modulation of caspase-3 and AKT signaling pathways,2017-06-29,"Laryngeal cancers are mostly squamous cell carcinomas. Although targeting radio-resistant cancer cells is important for improving the treatmental efficiency, the signaling pathway- and therapeutic strategy-related to laryngeal carcinoma still require further study. Galangin is an active pharmacological ingredient, isolated from propolis and Alpinia officinarum Hance, and has been reported to have anticancer and anti-oxidative properties through regulation of cell cycle, resulting in angiogenesis, apoptosis, invasion and migration without triggering any toxicity in normal cells. PI3K/AKT and p38 are important signaling pathways to modulate cancer cell apoptosis and proliferation through caspase-3, NF-κB and mTOR signal pathways. Autophagy is also enhanced by activating LC3s and Beclin 1. In the present study, galangin was found to suppress laryngeal cancer cell proliferation. Also, flow cytometry, immunohistochemical and western blot analysis indicated that cell apoptosis was induced for galangin administration, promoting caspase-3 expression through regulating PI3K/AKT/NF-κB. Furthermore, galangin inhibited laryngeal cancer cell proliferation, related to p38 inactivation by galangin treatment. Additionally, mTOR activation regulated by PI3K/AKT was reduced by galangin, suppressing cancer cell transcription and proliferation. Our data also indicated that the tumor volume and weight in nude mice were reduced for galangin use in vivo accompanied by Ki-67 decrease and TUNEL increase in tumor tissues. Together, our data indicated that galangin has a potential role in suppressing human laryngeal cancer via inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, activating apoptosis and autophagy, which were regulated by p38 and AKT/NF-κB/mTOR pathways, providing a therapeutic strategy for human laryngeal cancer treatment.","Wang, Hai-Xu; Tang, Chen",Oncol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5562077/,52
2843,A novel quantitative PCR mediated by high-fidelity DNA polymerase,2017-09-04,"The biggest challenge for accurate diagnosis of viral infectious disease is the high genetic variability of involved viruses, which affects amplification efficiency and results in low sensitivity and narrow spectrum. Here, we developed a new simple qPCR mediated by high-fidelity (HF) DNA polymerase. The new method utilizes an HFman probe and one primer. Fluorescent signal was generated from the 3′–5′ hydrolysis of HFman probe by HF DNA polymerase before elongation initiation. Mismatches between probe/primer and template have less influence on the amplification efficiency of the new method. The new qPCR exhibited higher sensitivity and better adaptability to sequence variable templates than the conventional TaqMan probe based-qPCR in quantification of HIV-1 viral load. Further comparison with COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Test (v2.0) showed a good correlation coefficient (R(2) = 0.79) between both methods in quantification of HIV-1 viral load among 21 clinical samples. The characteristics of tolerance to variable templates and one probe-one primer system imply that the probe/primer design for the new method will be easier and more flexible than the conventional method for highly heterogeneous viruses. Therefore, the HF DNA polymerase-mediated qPCR method is a simple, sensitive and promising approach for the development of diagnostics for viral infectious diseases.","Zhang, Mengling; Liu, Kyle; Hu, Yihong; Lin, Yi; Li, Yang; Zhong, Ping; Jin, Xia; Zhu, Xiaoli; Zhang, Chiyu",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5583327/,52
2983,Infections on the move: how transient phases of host movement influence disease spread,2017-12-20,"Animal movement impacts the spread of human and wildlife diseases, and there is significant interest in understanding the role of migrations, biological invasions and other wildlife movements in spatial infection dynamics. However, the influence of processes acting on infections during transient phases of host movement is poorly understood. We propose a conceptual framework that explicitly considers infection dynamics during transient phases of host movement to better predict infection spread through spatial host networks. Accounting for host transient movement captures key processes that occur while hosts move between locations, which together determine the rate at which hosts spread infections through networks. We review theoretical and empirical studies of host movement and infection spread, highlighting the multiple factors that impact the infection status of hosts. We then outline characteristics of hosts, parasites and the environment that influence these dynamics. Recent technological advances provide disease ecologists unprecedented ability to track the fine-scale movement of organisms. These, in conjunction with experimental testing of the factors driving infection dynamics during host movement, can inform models of infection spread based on constituent biological processes.","Daversa, D.

3063,Development of improved therapeutic mesothelin-based vaccines for pancreatic cancer,2018-02-23,"Pancreatic cancer is the 5(th) leading cause of cancer deaths, and there are no effective treatments. We developed a poxvirus platform vaccine with improved immunogenicity and inserted the mesothelin gene to create an anti-mesothelin cancer vaccine. Mesothelin expression is mostly restricted to tumors in adult mammals and thus may be a good target for cancer treatment. We show here that the modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) virus expressing mesothelin and the enhanced MVA virus missing the immunosuppressive A35 gene and expressing mesothelin were both safe in mice and were able to induce IFN-gamma secreting T cells in response to mesothelin expressing tumor cells. In addition, the MVA virus has oncolytic properties in vitro as it can replicate in and kill Panc02 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line tumor cells, even though it is unable to replicate in most mammalian cells. Deletion of the A35 gene in MVA improved T cell responses as expected. However, we were unable to demonstrate inhibition of Panc02 tumor growth in immunocompetent mice with pre-vaccination of mice, boosts, or even intratumoral injections of the recombinant viruses. Vaccine efficacy may be limited by shedding of mesothelin from tumor cells thus creating a protective screen from the immune system.","White, Michael; Freistaedter, Andrew; Jones, Gwendolyn J.

3077,Interferon-β deficiency at asthma exacerbation promotes MLKL mediated necroptosis,2018-03-09,"Defective production of antiviral interferon (IFN)-β is thought to contribute to rhinovirus-induced asthma exacerbations. These exacerbations are associated with elevated lung levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), indicating occurrence of cell necrosis. We thus hypothesized that reduced lung IFN-β could contribute to necrotic cell death in a model of asthma exacerbations. Wild-type and IFN-β(−/−) mice were given saline or house dust mite (HDM) intranasally for 3 weeks to induce inflammation. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was then given for additional 3 days to induce exacerbation. HDM induced an eosinophilic inflammation, which was not associated with increased expression of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP or elevated bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) LDH levels in wild-type. However, exacerbation evoked by HDM + dsRNA challenges increased BALF levels of LDH, apoptotic markers and the necroptotic markers receptor-interacting protein (RIP)-3 and phosphorylation of mixed linage kinase domain-like protein (pMLKL), compared to HDM + saline. Absence of IFN-β at exacerbation further increased BALF LDH and protein expression of pMLKL compared to wild-type. We demonstrate that cell death markers are increased at viral stimulus-induced exacerbation in mouse lungs, and that absence of IFN-β augments markers of necroptotic cell death at exacerbation. Our data thus suggest a novel role of deficient IFN-β production at viral-induced exacerbation.","Cerps, Samuel C.; Menzel, Mandy; Mahmutovic Persson, Irma; Bjermer, Leif; Akbarshahi, Hamid; Uller, Lena",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5844912/,52
3109,Testing therapeutics in cell-based assays: Factors that influence the apparent potency of drugs,2018-03-22,"Identifying effective antivirals for treating Ebola virus disease (EVD) and minimizing transmission of such disease is critical. A variety of cell-based assays have been developed for evaluating compounds for activity against Ebola virus. However, very few reports discuss the variable assay conditions that can affect the results obtained from these drug screens. Here, we describe variable conditions tested during the development of our cell-based drug screen assays designed to identify compounds with anti-Ebola virus activity using established cell lines and human primary cells. The effect of multiple assay readouts and variable assay conditions, including virus input, time of infection, and the cell passage number, were compared, and the impact on the effective concentration for 50% and/ or 90% inhibition (EC(50), EC(90)) was evaluated using the FDA-approved compound, toremifene citrate. In these studies, we show that altering cell-based assay conditions can have an impact on apparent drug potency as measured by the EC(50).

3128,A Critical Domain of Ebolavirus Envelope Glycoprotein Determines Glycoform and Infectivity,2018-04-03,"Ebolaviruses comprises 5 species that exert varying degrees of mortality/infectivity in humans with Reston ebolaviruses (REBOV) showing the lowest and Zaire ebolaviruses (ZEBOV) showing the highest. However, the molecular basis of this differential mortality/infectivity remains unclear. Here, we report that the structural features of ebolavirus envelope glycoproteins (GPs) and one of their counter receptors, macrophage galactose-type calcium-type lectin (MGL/CD301), play crucial roles in determining viral infectivity. The low infectivity of REBOV mediated by the interaction between GPs and MGL/CD301 dramatically increased when the N-terminal 18 amino acids (33rd through 50th) of GPs were replaced with that of ZEBOV. Furthermore, structural analysis of glycans of GPs revealed that N-glycans were more extended in REBOV than in ZEBOV. N-glycan extension was reversed by the replacement of aforementioned N-terminal 18 amino acid residues. Therefore, these data strongly suggest that extended N-glycans on GPs reduce MGL/CD301-mediated viral infectivity by hindering the interaction between GPs and MGL/CD301 preferentially binds O-glycans.","Fujihira, Haruhiko; Usami, Katsuaki; Matsuno, Keita; Takeuchi, Hideyuki; Denda-Nagai, Kaori; Furukawa, Jun-ichi; Shinohara, Yasuro; Takada, Ayato; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Irimura, Tatsuro",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5882653/,52

ADP-ribosylation is a posttranslational modification catalyzed primarily by ARTD (aka PARP) enzymes in cells. ARTDs transfer either single or multiple ADP-ribose units to substrates, resulting in mono- or poly-ADP-ribosylation. TARG1/C6orf130 is a macrodomain protein that hydrolyzes mono-ADP-ribosylation and interacts with poly-ADP-ribose chains. Interactome analyses revealed that TARG1 binds strongly to ribosomes and proteins associated with rRNA processing and ribosomal assembly factors. TARG1 localized to transcriptionally active nucleoli, which occurred independently of ADP-ribose binding. TARG1 shuttled continuously between nucleoli and nucleoplasm. In response to DNA damage, which activates ARTD1/2 (PARP1/2) and promotes synthesis of poly-ADP-ribose chains, TARG1 re-localized to the nucleoplasm. This was dependent on the ability of TARG1 to bind to poly-ADP-ribose. These findings are consistent with the observed ability of TARG1 to competitively interact with RNA and PAR chains. We propose a nucleolar role of TARG1 in ribosome assembly or quality control that is stalled when TARG1 is re-located to sites of DNA damage.","Bütepage, Mareike; Preisinger, Christian; von Kriegsheim, Alexander; Scheufen, Anja; Lausberg, Eva; Li, Jinyu; Kappes, Ferdinand; Feederle, Regina; Ernst, Sabrina; Eckei, Laura; Krieg, Sarah; Müller-Newen, Gerhard; Rossetti, Giulia; Feijs, Karla L.

3194,Computer-aided design of amino acid-based therapeutics: a review,2018-05-14,"During the last two decades, the pharmaceutical industry has progressed from detecting small molecules to designing biologic-based therapeutics. Amino acid-based drugs are a group of biologic-based therapeutics that can effectively combat the diseases caused by drug resistance or molecular deficiency. Computational techniques play a key role to design and develop the amino acid-based therapeutics such as proteins, peptides and peptidomimetics. In this study, it was attempted to discuss the various elements for computational design of amino acid-based therapeutics. Protein design seeks to identify the properties of amino acid sequences that fold to predetermined structures with desirable structural and functional characteristics. Peptide drugs occupy a middle space between proteins and small molecules and it is hoped that they can target “undruggable” intracellular protein–protein interactions. Peptidomimetics, the compounds that mimic the biologic characteristics of peptides, present refined pharmacokinetic properties compared to the original peptides. Here, the elaborated techniques that are developed to characterize the amino acid sequences consistent with a specific structure and allow protein design are discussed. Moreover, the key principles and recent advances in currently introduced computational techniques for rational peptide design are spotlighted. The most advanced computational techniques developed to design novel peptidomimetics are also summarized.","Farhadi, Tayebeh; Hashemian, Seyed MohammadReza",Drug Des Devel Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5958949/,52
3211,Use of Hemagglutinin Stem Probes Demonstrate Prevalence of Broadly Reactive Group 1 Influenza Antibodies in Human Sera,2018-06-05,"A better understanding of the seroprevalence and specificity of influenza HA stem-directed broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) in the human population could significantly inform influenza vaccine design efforts. Here, we utilized probes comprising headless, HA stabilized stem (SS) to determine the prevalence, binding and neutralization breadth of antibodies directed to HA stem-epitope in a cross-sectional analysis of the general population. Five group-1 HA SS probes, representing five subtypes, were chosen for this analyses. Eighty-four percent of samples analyzed had specific reactivity to at least one probe, with approximately 60% of the samples reactive to H1 probes, and up to 45% reactive to each of the non-circulating subtypes. Thirty percent of analyzed sera had cross-reactivity to at least four of five probes and this reactivity could be blocked by competing with F10 bNAb. Binding cross-reactivity in sera samples significantly correlated with frequency of H1(+)H5(+) cross-reactive B cells. Interestingly, only 33% of the cross-reactive sera neutralized both H1N1 and H5N1 pseudoviruses. Cross-reactive and neutralizing antibodies were more prevalent in individuals >50 years of age. Our data demonstrate the need to use multiple HA-stem probes to assess for broadly reactive antibodies. Further, a universal vaccine could be designed to boost pre-existing B-cells expressing stem-directed bNAbs.","Yassine, Hadi M.; McTamney, Patrick M.; Boyington, Jeffery C.; Ruckwardt, Tracy J.; Crank, Michelle C.; Smatti, Maria K.; Ledgerwood, Julie E.; Graham, Barney S.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5988737/,52

We investigated AstVs circulation in bats in Mozambique and Mayotte, a small island in the Comoros Archipelago located between east Africa and Madagascar. Biological material was collected from 338 bats and tested for the presence of the AstV RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase gene with a pan-AstV semi-nested polymerase chain reaction assay. None of the 79 samples obtained from Mayotte bats (Pteropus seychellensis comorensis and Chaerephon pusillus) tested positive; however, 20.1% of bats sampled in Mozambique shed AstVs at the time of sampling and significant interspecific variation in the proportion of positive bats was detected. Many AstVs sequences obtained from a given bat species clustered in different phylogenetic lineages, while others seem to reflect some level of host-virus association, but also with AstVs previously reported from Malagasy bats. Our findings support active circulation of a large diversity of AstVs in bats in the western Indian Ocean islands, including the southeastern African coast, and highlight the need for more detailed assessment of its risk of zoonotic transmission to human populations.

Dysfunctional microglial responses are thought to worsen CNS diseases; nevertheless, their impact during neuroinflammatory processes remains largely obscure. Here, using a combination of single‐cell RNA sequencing and multicolour flow cytometry, we comprehensively profile microglia in the brain of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‐injected mice. By excluding the contribution of other immune CNS‐resident and peripheral cells, we show that microglia isolated from LPS‐injected mice display a global downregulation of their homeostatic signature together with an upregulation of inflammatory genes. Notably, we identify distinct microglial activated profiles under inflammatory conditions, which greatly differ from neurodegenerative disease‐associated profiles. These results provide insights into microglial heterogeneity and establish a resource for the identification of specific phenotypes in CNS disorders, such as neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases.","Sousa, Carole; Golebiewska, Anna; Poovathingal, Suresh K; Kaoma, Tony; Pires‐Afonso, Yolanda; Martina, Silvia; Coowar, Djalil; Azuaje, Francisco; Skupin, Alexander; Balling, Rudi; Biber, Knut; Niclou, Simone P; Michelucci, Alessandro",EMBO Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6216255/,52

3521,18α-Glycyrrhetinic Acid Induces Apoptosis of HL-60 Human Leukemia Cells through Caspases- and Mitochondria-Dependent Signaling Pathways,2016-07-01,"In this study we investigate the molecular mechanisms of caspases and mitochondria in the extrinsic and intrinsic signal apoptosis pathways in human leukemia HL-60 cells after in vitro exposure to 18α-glycyrrhetinic acid (18α-GA). Cells were exposed to 18α-GA at various concentrations for various time periods and were harvested for flow cytometry total viable cell and apoptotic cell death measurements. Cells treated with 18α-GA significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC(50) value of 100 μM at 48 h. The cell growth inhibition resulted in induction of apoptosis and decreased the mitochondria membrane potential (ΔΨ(m)) and increased caspase-8, -9 and -3 activities. Furthermore, cytochrome c and AIF were released from mitochondria, as shown by western blotting and confirmed by confocal laser microscopy. Western blotting showed that 18α-GA increased the levels of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax and Bid and decreased the anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl, furthermore, results also showed that 18α-GA increased Fas and Fas-L which are associated with surface death receptor in HL-60 cells. Based on those observations, the present study supports the hypothesis that 18α-GA-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells involves the activation of the both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways.","Huang, Yi-Chang; Kuo, Chao-Lin; Lu, Kung-Wen; Lin, Jen-Jyh; Yang, Jiun-Long; Wu, Rick Sai-Chuen; Wu, Ping-Ping; Chung, Jing-Gung",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6273602/,52

In the Tc goat system, a human artificial chromosome (HAC) comprising the entire human immunoglobulin (Ig) gene repertoire in the germline configuration was introduced into the genetic makeup of the domestic goat. We achieved this by transferring the HAC into goat fetal fibroblast cells followed by somatic cell nuclear transfer for Tc goat production. Gene and protein expression analyses in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and the sera, respectively, of Tc caprine demonstrated the successful expression of human Ig genes and antibodies. Furthermore, immunization of Tc caprine with inactivated influenza A (H7N9) viruses followed by H7N9 Hemagglutinin 1 (HA1) boosting elicited human antibodies with high neutralizing activities against H7N9 viruses in vitro.

3640,Inhibiting APOBEC3 Activity with Single-Stranded DNA Containing 2′-Deoxyzebularine Analogues,2018-11-12,"[Image: see text] APOBEC3 enzymes form part of the innate immune system by deaminating cytosine to uracil in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and thereby preventing the spread of pathogenic genetic information. However, APOBEC mutagenesis is also exploited by viruses and cancer cells to increase rates of evolution, escape adaptive immune responses, and resist drugs. This raises the possibility of APOBEC3 inhibition as a strategy for augmenting existing antiviral and anticancer therapies. Here we show that, upon incorporation into short ssDNAs, the cytidine nucleoside analogue 2′-deoxyzebularine (dZ) becomes capable of inhibiting the catalytic activity of selected APOBEC variants derived from APOBEC3A, APOBEC3B, and APOBEC3G, supporting a mechanism in which ssDNA delivers dZ to the active site. Multiple experimental approaches, including isothermal titration calorimetry, fluorescence polarization, protein thermal shift, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy assays, demonstrate nanomolar dissociation constants and low micromolar inhibition constants. These dZ-containing ssDNAs constitute the first substrate-like APOBEC3 inhibitors and, together, comprise a platform for developing nucleic acid-based inhibitors with cellular activity.","Kvach, Maksim V.; Barzak, Fareeda M.; Harjes, Stefan; Schares, Henry A.

3677,A colorimetric strategy based on dynamic chemistry for direct detection of Trypanosomatid species,2019-03-06,"Leishmaniasis and Chagas disease are endemic in many countries, and re-emerging in the developed countries. A rapid and accurate diagnosis is important for early treatment for reducing the duration of infection as well as for preventing further potential health complications. In this work, we have developed a novel colorimetric molecular assay that integrates nucleic acid analysis by dynamic chemistry (ChemNAT) with reverse dot-blot hybridization in an array format for a rapid and easy discrimination of Leishmania major and Trypanosoma cruzi. The assay consists of a singleplex PCR step that amplifies a highly homologous DNA sequence which encodes for the RNA component of the large ribosome subunit. The amplicons of the two different parasites differ between them by single nucleotide variations, known as “Single Nucleotide Fingerprint” (SNF) markers. The SNF markers can be easily identified by naked eye using a novel micro Spin-Tube device ""Spin-Tube"", as each of them creates a specific spot pattern. Moreover, the direct use of ribosomal RNA without requiring the PCR pre-amplification step is also feasible, further increasing the simplicity of the assay. The molecular assay delivers sensitivity capable of identifying up to 8.7 copies per µL with single mismatch specificity. The Spin-Tube thus represents an innovative solution providing benefits in terms of time, cost, and simplicity, all of which are crucial for the diagnosis of infectious disease in developing countries.","Tabraue-Chávez, Mavys; Luque-González, María Angélica; Marín-Romero, Antonio; Sánchez-Martín, Rosario María; Escobedo-Araque, Pablo; Pernagallo, Salvatore; Díaz-Mochón, Juan José",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6403333/,52
3733,The protonation state of an evolutionarily conserved histidine modulates domainswapping stability of FoxP1,2019-04-01,"Forkhead box P (FoxP) proteins are members of the versatile Fox transcription factors, which control the timing and expression of multiple genes for eukaryotic cell homeostasis. Compared to other Fox proteins, they can form domain-swapped dimers through their DNA-binding –forkhead– domains, enabling spatial reorganization of distant chromosome elements by tethering two DNA molecules together. Yet, domain swapping stability and DNA binding affinity varies between different FoxP proteins. Experimental evidence suggests that the protonation state of a histidine residue conserved in all Fox proteins is responsible for pH-dependent modulation of these interactions. Here, we explore the consequences of the protonation state of another histidine (H59), only conserved within FoxM/O/P subfamilies, on folding and dimerization of the forkhead domain of human FoxP1. Dimer dissociation kinetics and equilibrium unfolding experiments demonstrate that protonation of H59 leads to destabilization of the domain-swapped dimer due to an increase in free energy difference between the monomeric and transition states. This pH–dependence is abolished when H59 is mutated to alanine. Furthermore, anisotropy measurements and molecular dynamics evidence that H59 has a direct impact in the local stability of helix H3. Altogether, our results highlight the relevance of H59 in domain swapping and folding stability of FoxP1.","Medina, Exequiel; Villalobos, Pablo; Coñuecar, Ricardo; Ramírez-Sarmiento, César A.; Babul, Jorge",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6443806/,52

The Neotropical region harbors a considerable diversity of avian species that may play a role as both host and short-distance vectors of unknown viruses. Viral metagenomics of cloacal swabs from 50 Neotropical birds collected in French Guiana revealed the presence of four complete astrovirus genomes.

Their genomic organization shares some characteristics with Avastrovirus but also with Mamastrovirus. The pan-astrovirus RT-PCR analysis of the cloacal samples of 406 wild Neotropical birds showed a community-level prevalence of 4.9% (5.1% in passerines, the highest described so far in this order of birds). By screening birds of a remote region, we expanded the known host range of astroviruses to the avian families Cardinalidae, Conopophagidae, Furnariidae, Thamnophilidae, Turdidae and Tyrannidae.

However, few studies have used Internet search query or social media data to monitor spatial and temporal trends of avian influenza in China. This study investigated the potential of using search query and social media data in detecting and monitoring avian influenza A (H7N9) cases in humans in China. We collected weekly data on laboratory-confirmed H7N9 cases in humans, as well as H7N9-related Baidu Search Index (BSI) and Weibo Posting Index (WPI) data in China from 2013 to 2017, to explore the spatial and temporal trends of H7N9 cases and H7N9-related Internet search queries. Our findings showed a positive relationship of H7N9 cases with BSI and WPI search queries spatially and temporally. The outbreak threshold time and peak time of H7N9-related BSI and WPI searches preceded H7N9 cases in most years. Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models with BSI (β = 0.008, p < 0.001) and WPI (β = 0.002, p = 0.036) were used to predict the number of H7N9 cases. Regression tree model analysis showed that the average H7N9 cases increased by over 2.4-fold (26.8/11) when BSI for H7N9 was > = 11524. Both BSI and WPI data could be used as indicators to develop an early warning system for H7N9 outbreaks in the future.","Chen, Ying; Zhang, Yuzhou; Xu, Zhiwei; Wang, Xuanzhuo; Lu, Jiahai; Hu, Wenbiao",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6639335/,52

More recently, experimental approaches have emerged—and continue to emerge—for discerning the functional role of Ab structure, especially the Fc portion of antibody, in combating viral infections in vivo. A wide range of in vitro measures of antibody activity, from neutralization to antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)—each of these terms representing only an operational notion defined by the particulars of a given assay—are poised for assignment of both relevance and reliability in forecasting outcomes of infection. Of the several emergent technical opportunities for clarity, attention here is drawn to three realms: the increasing array of known modifications that can be engineered into Abs to affect their in vivo activities; the improvement of murine models involving knockouts and knock-ins of host genes including Fc receptors; and the development of additional virological design tools to differentiate Abs that act primarily by inhibiting viral entry from antibodies that mainly target viral antigens (Ags) on cell surfaces.

Mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV)- and cytokine-induced memory natural killer (NK) cells circulate in the blood and are referred to as conventional memory NK cells. In contrast, virus- and hapten-induced memory NK cells, hapten-induced memory ILC1s, and cytokine-induced memory-like ILC2s exhibit long-term residency in the liver or lung, and are referred to as tissue-resident memory ILCs. Considering their similar migration patterns and memory potential, tissue-resident memory ILCs could be regarded as innate counterparts of resident memory T (T(RM)) cells. Both tissue-resident memory ILCs and T(RM) cells share common characteristics in terms of dynamics, phenotype, and molecular regulation. The emergence of ILC memory expands the basic biology of ILCs and prompts us to re-examine their functions in disease progression. This review discusses the evidence supporting tissue-resident memory NK cells and other memory ILC subsets, compares them with T(RM) cells, and highlights key unsolved questions in this emerging field.","Wang, Xianwei; Tian, Zhigang; Peng, Hui",Protein Cell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6954904/,52
4442,"PfSWIB, a potential chromatin regulator for var gene regulation and parasite development in Plasmodium falciparum",2020-02-04,"BACKGROUND: Various transcription factors are involved in the process of mutually exclusive expression and clonal variation of the Plasmodium multigene (var) family. Recent studies revealed that a P. falciparum SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin (PfSWIB) might trigger stage-specific programmed cell death (PCD), and was not only crucial for the survival and development of parasite, but also had profound effects on the parasite by interacting with other unknown proteins. However, it remains unclear whether PfSIWB is involved in transcriptional regulation of this virulence gene and its functional properties. METHODS: A conditional knockdown system “PfSWIB-FKBP-LID” was introduced to the parasite clone 3D7, and an integrated parasite line “PfSWIB-HA-FKBP-LID” was obtained by drug cycling and clone screening. Growth curve analysis (GCA) was performed to investigate the growth and development of different parasite lines during 96 h in vitro culturing, by assessing parasitemia. Finally, we performed qPCR assays to detect var gene expression profiling in various comparison groups, as well as the mutually exclusive expression pattern of the var genes within a single 48 h life-cycle of P. falciparum in different parasite lines. In addition, RNA-seq was applied to analyze the var gene expression in different lines. RESULTS: GCA revealed that conditional knockdown of PfSWIB could interfere with the growth and development of P. falciparum. The parasitemia of PfSWIB∆ showed a significant decline at 96 h during in vitro culture compared with the PfSWIB and 3D7 lines (P < 0.0001). qPCR and RNA-seq analysis confirmed that depletion of PfSWIB not only silences upsA, upsC and partial upsB var genes, as well as removes the silencing of partial upsB var genes at the ring stage in PfSWIB∆ line, but also leads to aberrant expression of upsA and partial upsB/upsC var genes at the mature stage of P. falciparum, during a single 48-h life-cycle. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that PfSWIB was involved in the process of clonal variation in var gene expression, and crucial for the survival and development of Plasmodium parasite. These findings could provide better understanding of the mechanism and function of PfSWIB contributing to the pathogenesis in malaria parasites.

4475,Integrative QTL analysis of gene expression and chromatin accessibility identifies multi-tissue patterns of genetic regulation,2020-01-21,"Temperate phages are considered as natural vectors for gene transmission among bacteria due to the ability to integrate their genomes into a host chromosome, therefore, affect the fitness and phenotype of host bacteria. Many virulence genes of pathogenic bacteria were identified in temperate phage genomes, supporting the concept that temperate phages play important roles in increasing the bacterial pathogenicity through delivery of the virulence genes. However, little is known about the roles of temperate phages in attenuation of bacterial virulence. Here, we report a novel Bordetella bronchiseptica temperate phage, vB_BbrS_PHB09 (PHB09), which has a 42,129-bp dsDNA genome with a G+C content of 62.8%. Phylogenetic analysis based on large terminase subunit indicated that phage PHB09 represented a new member of the family Siphoviridae. The genome of PHB09 contains genes encoding lysogen-associated proteins, including integrase and cI protein. The integration site of PHB09 is specifically located within a pilin gene of B. bronchiseptica. Importantly, we found that the integration of phage PHB09 significantly decreased the virulence of parental strain B. bronchiseptica Bb01 in mice, most likely through disruption the expression of pilin gene. Moreover, a single shot of the prophage bearing B. bronchiseptica strain completely protected mice against lethal challenge with wild-type virulent B. bronchiseptica, indicating the vaccine potential of lysogenized strain. Our findings not only indicate the complicated roles of temperate phages in bacterial virulence other than simple delivery of virulent genes but also provide a potential strategy for developing bacterial vaccines.","Chen, Yibao; Yang, Lan; Yang, Dan; Song, Jiaoyang; Wang, Can; Sun, Erchao; Gu, Changqin; Chen, Huanchun; Tong, Yigang; Tao, Pan; Wu, Bin",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7010805/,52
4569,"The behavioral, cellular and immune mediators of HIV-1 acquisition: New insights from population genetics",2020-02-24,"BACKGROUND: An extreme and persistent dysbiosis occurs among critically ill patients, regardless of the heterogeneity of disease. Dysbiosis in critically ill patients may make them prone to hospital-acquired infections, sepsis, multi-organ failure (MOF), energy homeostasis disturbance, muscle wasting, and cachexia. Modulation of gut microbiota through synbiotics can be considered as a potential treatment for muscle wasting and macronutrient homeostasis disturbances. METHODS: This is a prospective, single-center, double-blind, parallel randomized controlled trial with the aim to evaluate the effects of synbiotic supplementation on energy and macronutrient homeostasis and muscle wasting in critically ill patients. A total of 40 hemodynamically stable, adult, critically ill patients who receive enteral nutrition via a nasogasteric tube (NGT) in the 24–48 h after admission to critical care will be included in this study. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive Lactocare (ZistTakhmir) capsules 500 mg every 12 h or a placebo capsule, which contains only the sterile maize starch and is similar to synbiotic capsules for 14 days. The synbiotic and placebo capsules will be given through the nasogastric tube, separately from gavage, after feeding. DISCUSSION: Gut microbiota modulation through synbiotics is proposed to improve clinical prognosis and reduce infectious complications, ventilator dependency, and length of ICU stay by improving energy and macronutrient homeostasis and reducing muscle protein catabolism.

4577,Natural selection supports escape from concerted evolution of a recently duplicated CEACAM1 paralog in the ruminant CEA gene family,2020-02-25,"BACKGROUND: Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) is a highly invasive bacterium that infects the human intestinal mucosa and causes ~ 11.9–20.6 million infections and ~ 130,000–223,000 deaths annually worldwide. Oral typhoid vaccine Ty21a confers a moderate level of long-lived protection (5–7 years) in the field. New and improved vaccines against enteric pathogens are needed but their development is hindered by a lack of the immunological correlates of protection especially at the site of infection. Tissue resident memory T (T(RM)) cells provide immediate adaptive effector immune responsiveness at the infection site. However, the mechanism(s) by which S. Typhi induces T(RM) in the intestinal mucosa are unknown. Here, we focus on the induction of S. Typhi-specific CD4+T(RM) subsets by Ty21a in the human terminal ileum lamina propria and epithelial compartments. METHODS: Terminal ileum biopsies were obtained from consenting volunteers undergoing routine colonoscopy who were either immunized orally with 4 doses of Ty21a or not. Isolated lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) and intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) CD4+T(RM) immune responses were determined using either S. Typhi-infected or non-infected autologous EBV-B cell lines as stimulator cells. T-CMI was assessed by the production of 4 cytokines [interferon (IFN)γ, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-17A and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α] in 36 volunteers (18 vaccinees and 18 controls volunteers). RESULTS: Although the frequencies of LPMC CD103+ CD4+T(RM) were significant decreased, both CD103+ and CD103− CD4+T(RM) subsets spontaneously produced significantly higher levels of cytokines (IFNγ and IL-17A) following Ty21a-immunization. Importantly, we observed significant increases in S. Typhi-specific LPMC CD103+ CD4+T(RM) (IFNγ and IL-17A) and CD103− CD4+T(RM) (IL-2 and IL-17A) responses following Ty21a-immunization. Further, differences in S. Typhi-specific responses between these two CD4+T(RM) subsets were observed following multifunctional analysis. In addition, we determined the effect of Ty21a-immunization on IEL and observed significant changes in the frequencies of IEL CD103+ (decrease) and CD103− CD4+T(RM) (increase) following immunization. Finally, we observed that IEL CD103− CD4+T(RM), but not CD103+ CD4+T(RM), produced increased cytokines (IFNγ, TNFα and IL-17A) to S. Typhi-specific stimulation following Ty21a-immunization. CONCLUSIONS: Oral Ty21a-immunization elicits distinct compartment specific immune responses in CD4+T(RM) (CD103+ and CD103−) subsets.

In this study, we characterised the HIV-1 molecular epidemiology by analysing 1442 HIV-1 pol sequences collected 1999–2014 from four geopolitical zones in Nigeria using state-of-the-art maximum-likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. The main circulating forms were the circulating recombinant form (CRF) 02_AG (44% of the analysed sequences), CRF43_02G (16%), and subtype G (8%). Twenty-three percent of the sequences represented unique recombinant forms (URFs), whereof 37 (11%) could be grouped into seven potentially novel CRFs. Bayesian phylodynamic analysis suggested that five major Nigerian HIV-1 sub-epidemics were introduced in the 1960s and 1970s, close to the Nigerian Civil War. The analysis also indicated that the number of effective infections decreased in Nigeria after the introduction of free antiretroviral treatment in 2006. Finally, Bayesian phylogeographic analysis suggested gravity-like dynamics in which virus lineages first emerge and expand within large urban centers such as Abuja and Lagos, before migrating towards smaller rural areas. This study provides novel insight into the Nigerian HIV-1 epidemic and may have implications for future HIV-1 prevention strategies in Nigeria and other severely affected countries.","Nazziwa, Jamirah; Faria, Nuno Rodrigues; Chaplin, Beth; Rawizza, Holly; Kanki, Phyllis; Dakum, Patrick; Abimiku, Alash’le; Charurat, Man; Ndembi, Nicaise; Esbjörnsson, Joakim",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7044301/,52

This review aimed to provide an overview of the ecological and epidemiological profiles of mosquito-borne viral infections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). METHODS: A search of literature was conducted using Google Scholar, PubMed and the WHO website using the following keywords: “Democratic Republic of the Congo”, “Zaire”, “Belgian Congo” and either of the following: “mosquito-borne virus”, “arbovirus”, “yellow fever”, “dengue”, “chikungunya”, “West Nile”, “Rift Valley fever”, “O’nyong’nyong”, “Zika”, “epidemiology”, “ecology”, “morbidity”, “mortality”. Published articles in English or French covering a period between 1912 and October 2018 were reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 37 articles were included in the review. The findings indicate that the burden of mosquito-borne viral infections in DRC is increasing over time and space. The north-western, north-eastern, western and central regions have the highest burden of mosquito-borne viral infections compared to south and eastern highland regions. Yellow fever, chikungunya, dengue, Zika, Rift Valley fever, West Nile and O’nyong’nyong have been reported in the country. These mosquito-borne viruses were found circulating in human, wildlife and domestic animals. Yellow fever and chikungunya outbreaks have been frequently reported. Aedes aegypti and Ae. simpsoni were documented as the main vectors of most of the mosquito-borne viral infections. Heavy rains, human movements, forest encroachment and deforestation were identified as drivers of mosquito-borne viruses occurrence in DRC. CONCLUSIONS: Mosquito-borne viral infections are becoming common and a serious public health problem in DRC. In the current context of climate change, there is urgent need to improve understanding on ecological and epidemiology of the diseases and strengthen surveillance systems for prompt response to epidemics in DRC.","Mbanzulu, Kennedy M.; Mboera, Leonard E.

5052,T cell approach to demyelinating diseases,1985,"T-2 mycotoxin, a trichothecene, is the principal toxic component ofFusarium sp. Agricultural products and food are frequently contaminated with this toxin. Various animal models have been used to determine its metabolic fate, rate of excretion, and distribution. A modulation effect on cell-mediated immunity and alterations in gastrointestinal propulsion have been demonstrated. The toxin has been shown to produce some similar pathologic alterations in various animal species studied. The consistent alteration appears to mainly affect mitotic cells of the gastrointestinal tract and the lymphoid system. A host of bioassay systems are now being used as alternative methods to the use of animals for testing of the mycotoxin. These tests may accurately assess and define the role of the subject-toxin interactions following consumption of T-2 mycotoxin contaminated food sources. T-2 mycotoxin, as observed above within vivo andin vitro models, promotes a chemically-induced change in structure and function of affected gastrointestinal cells from a transient and reversible aberration in a single enzymatic reaction to cell death. Regardless of the end point measured, the toxic response brought about in cells appears to involve the interactions of virtually all subcellular processes—membrane transport and permeability, chemical metabolism, DNA function, and energy production/expenditure—as cells attempt to maintain their functional integrity while disposing of the toxicant. The variation in the quality of the toxic response with dose suggests that more cellular processes are perturbed as the chemical dose is increased.","Williams, Phletus P.",Arch Environ Contam Toxicol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087545/,52
5064,Tropical sprue,1990,"CEA cell adhesion molecule-1 (CEACAM1) is a cell–cell adhesion molecule that, paradoxically, is expressed in an apical location in normal breast epithelium. Strong lumenal membrane staining is observed in 100% of normal glands (11/11), low in atypical hyperplasia (2/6), high in cribiform ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (8/8), but low in other types of DCIS (2/15). Although most invasive ductal carcinomas express CEACAM1 (21/26), the staining pattern tends to be weak and cytoplasmic in tumours with minimal lumena formation (grades 2–3), while there is membrane staining in well-differentiated tumours (grade 1). The 'normal' breast epithelial line MCF10F forms acini with lumena in Matrigel with apical membrane expression of CEACAM1. MCF7 cells that do not express CEACAM1 and fail to form lumena in Matrigel, revert to a lumen forming phenotype when transfected with the CEACAM1-4S but not the -4L isoform. CEACAM1 directly associates with and down-regulates the expression of β1-integrin. Immuno-electron microscopy reveals numerous vesicles coated with CEACAM1 within the lumena, and as predicted by this finding, CEACAM1 is found in the lipid fraction of breast milk. Thus, CEACAM1 is a critical molecule in mammary morphogenesis and may play a role in the absorption of the lipid vesicles of milk in the infant intestinal tract.","Kirshner, Julia; Hardy, John; Wilczynski, Sharon; Shively, John E.",J Mol Histol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087591/,52

5557,The MicroRNA (miRNA): Overview of the RNA Genes that Modulate Gene Function,2007-11-13,"Three-dimensional objects can be represented using Cartesian, spherical or cylindrical coordinate systems, among many others. Currently all protein 3D structures in the PDB are in Cartesian coordinates. We wanted to explore the possibility that protein 3D structures, especially the globular type (spheroproteins), when represented in spherical coordinates might find useful novel applications. A Fortran program was written to transform protein 3D structure files in Cartesian coordinates (x,y,z) to spherical coordinates (ρ, ϕ, θ), with the centroid of the protein molecule as origin. We present here two applications, namely, (1) separation of the protein outer layer (OL) from the inner core (IC); and (2) identifying protrusions and invaginations on the protein surface. In the first application, ϕ and θ were partitioned into suitable intervals and the point with maximum ρ in each such ‘ϕ-θ bin’ was determined. A suitable cutoff value for ρ is adopted, and for each ϕ-θ bin, all points with ρ values less than the cutoff are considered part of the IC, and those with ρ values equal to or greater than the cutoff are considered part of the OL. We show that this separation procedure is successful as it gives rise to an OL that is significantly more enriched in hydrophilic amino acid residues, and an IC that is significantly more enriched in hydrophobic amino acid residues, as expected. In the second application, the point with maximum ρ in each ϕ-θ bin are sequestered and their frequency distribution constructed (i.e., maximum ρ’s sorted from lowest to highest, collected into 1.50Å-intervals, and the frequency in each interval plotted). We show in such plots that invaginations on the protein surface give rise to subpeaks or shoulders on the lagging side of the main peak, while protrusions give rise to similar subpeaks or shoulders, but on the leading side of the main peak. We used the dataset of Laskowski et al. (1996) to demonstrate both applications.","Reyes, Vicente M.",Interdiscip Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091412/,52

Additionally, the influence of baseline patient and transplant characteristics on hematopoietic recovery was evaluated. From January 1994 to March 1996, 47 consecutive adult patients received VUD-BMT. GVHD prophylaxis was cyclosporin A/short course methotrexate/prednisolone, and in four patients additional ATG. Post-transplantation, cohorts of patients received rhG-CSF (5 μg/kg/day) (n = 22) or no rhG-CSF (n = 25) in a non-randomized manner. The patient groups with and without rhG-CSF were rather comparable with respect to baseline patient and transplant characteristics. Median time to neutrophil counts (ANC) >500/μl was 14 days with rhG-CSF vs 16 days without rhG-CSF (P = 0.048), to ANC >1000/μl was 15 vs 18 days (P = 0.084). Neutrophil recovery was accelerated in patients receiving more than the median MNC dose of 2.54 × 10(8)/kg with a median time to ANC >1000/μl of 13 days vs 19 days (P = 0.017). RhG-CSF did not influence platelet recovery and incidence of infectious complications. Incidence of acute GVHD II–IV was 50% with rhG-CSF and 28% without rhG-CSF (P = 0.144), but death before acute GVHD II–IV occurred in 9% of patients with and 20% of patients without rhG-CSF. The median follow-up time was 38 and 36 months in patients with and without rhG-CSF, respectively. Survival at 2 years post-transplant was 39% (95% confidence interval (18%, 60%)) in patients with rhG-CSF and 24% (95% confidence interval (7%, 41%)) in patients without rhG-CSF. Administration of rhG-CSF after VUD-BMT may lead to more rapid neutrophil recovery, but did not influence the incidence of infectious complications. Patients receiving rhG-CSF showed a slightly higher incidence of acute GVHD II–IV. Higher numbers of MNC in the marrow graft accelerated hematopoietic engraftment.","Berger, C; Bertz, H; Schmoor, C; Behringer, D; Potthoff, K; Mertelsmann, R; Finke, J",Bone Marrow Transplant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091765/,52

5687,Global Infections—Avian Influenza and Other Significant Emerging Pathogens: An Overview,2007-08-06,"Asthma in children has many special features which deserve consideration. This disease is probably underdiagnosed and is often undertreated. Vague, persistent respiratory symptoms, especially chronic cough, may often be due to asthma. Chronic bronchitis is extremely rare in the pediatric patient and is a manifestation of reactive airway disease or cystic fibrosis. The absolute severity, the extent of the disease, responses to treatment, and long-term course should be evaluated by repeated pulmonary function tests. Fortunately, asthma responds well to pharmacologic and supportive therapy, and it is important to approach its management as that of a chronic rather than episodic illness. Therapy should include comprehensive, closely supervised drug therapy, health education, and a program of selfmanagement. Asthma usually starts before youngsters enter school, and the majority get better as they get older. Nevertheless, many children with moderate or severe asthma will continue to be troubled by intermittent or chronic airway obstruction into adulthood, and they require long-term, anticipatory treatment programs. Comprehensive care will optimize the quality of life for the affected children and their families, and it will minimize the discomfort and restrictions to which some of them have been subjected unnecessarily. Asthma in childhood, especially when not well controlled, may constitute a risk factor for the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adulthood; however, this is as yet only suspected and not proved.(47)","Cropp, Gerd J.A.",Chest,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094267/,52

6484,"Activin, neutrophils, and inflammation: just coincidence?",2013-02-06,"The effects of pulmonary surfactant on granulocytes were studied by flow cytofluorometry. Cells from hemolyzed blood were first activated by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) which mobilizes complement receptor 1 (CR1) from the intracellular pool to the cell surface. The reduced CR1 expression observed after quartz incubation was abolished by a porcine surfactant preparation containing phospholipids and the hydrophobic surfactant proteins. Phospholipids alone had no preservative capacity. However, addition of the surfactant proteins to the phospholipids did not restore the CR1 values to that of intact surfactant, probably due to changed protein structure during the purification procedure. Heating of surfactant at 37°C up to 72 h reduced the preservative effect of surfactant on CR1 expression. Congruent results of CR1 expression were achieved when 1–10% lysophosphatidylcholine was added to the surfactant preparations. Our results imply that lysophosphatidylcholine formed during storage of surfactant at elevated temperatures influences CR1 expression on granuloyctes.","Zetterberg, G.; Curstedt, T.; Lundahl, J.; Eklund, A.",Inflammation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101607/,52
6835,Generation of outbred Ace2 knockout mice by RNA transfection of TALENs displaying colitis reminiscent pathophysiology and inflammation,2014-12-02,"PURPOSE: The definition of risk factors associated with acute renal failure (ARF) following orthotropic liver transplantation (OLT) is still controversial. Cryoprecipitate, which can supply fibrinogen and other coagulation factors, is widely used in OLT. However, the effects of intraoperative cryoprecipitate transfusion on ARF following OLT remain unclear. METHODS: In a series of 389 adult patients who received grafts from deceased donors and underwent their first OLT, the clinical correlation between intraoperative cryoprecipitate transfusion and ARF following OLT was retrospectively studied after adjusting for potential confounders. The distribution of ARF and the causes of death within the first year after OLT were also compared separately in patients with and without cryoprecipitate transfusion. RESULTS: The incidence of ARF in patients with cryoprecipitate transfusion was significantly higher than in patients without cryoprecipitate transfusion (15.9 vs. 7.8 %, p = 0.012). A nonlinear relationship between intraoperative cryoprecipitate transfusion and ARF following OLT was observed. The risk of ARF increased with the cryoprecipitate transfusion level up to the turning point (16 U) (adjusted OR 1.1, 95 % CI 1.1–1.2; p < 0.001). When the cryoprecipitate level exceeded 16 U, the level of cryoprecipitate transfusion was not associated with the risk of ARF (OR 0.95, 95 % CI 0.85–1.1; p = 0.319). Deaths within the first year after the operation occurred more frequently in cases with cryoprecipitate transfusion (22.9 vs. 14.2 %, p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that intraoperative cryoprecipitate transfusion is associated with ARF following OLT. Cryoprecipitate transfusion during OLT should be performed carefully until more convincing evidence has been found.","Liu, Shuang; Wang, Xiaoliang; Lu, Yuanshan; Li, Tao; Gong, Zijun; Sheng, Tao; Hu, Bin; Peng, Zhihai; Sun, Xing",Hepatol Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102214/,52

However, rodent models are limited by several important physiological and metabolic differences from humans, and many rodent models do not dependably replicate the clinical manifestations of human diseases. Due to the high degree of similarity in anatomy, physiology, immunology and brain growth, the domestic pig (Sus scrofa) is considered a clinically relevant model to study factors influencing human gastrointestinal, immune, and brain development. Gnotobiotic piglet models have been developed and shown to recapitulate key aspects of GN rodent models. Human microbiota-associated (HMA) piglets have been established using inocula from infants, children, and adults. The gut microbiota of recipient HMA piglets was more similar to that of the human donor than that of conventionally reared piglets harboring a pig microbiota. Moreover, Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides, two predominant bacterial groups of infant gut, were successfully established in the HMA piglets. Thus, the HMA pig model has the potential to be a valuable model for investigating how the gut microbiota composition changes in response to environmental factors, such as age, diet, vaccination, antibiotic use and infection. The HMA also represents a robust model for screening the efficacy of pre- and probiotic interventions. Lastly, HMA piglets can be an ideal model with which to elucidate microbe–host interactions in human health and disease due to the similarities to humans in anatomy, physiology, developmental maturity at birth, and the pathophysiology of many human diseases.","Wang, Mei; Donovan, Sharon M.",ILAR J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108572/,52

The sensitivities of the two cell types for isolation of viruses in the major groups infecting man are compared. The use of both BS-C-1 and RK-13 cells yielded approximately 25% more rubella virus isolates than were recovered in a single cell system. Procedures such as the establishment of cell cultures from tissues suspected of harboring viruses, cocultivation of cells from biopsy or autopsy specimens with other cell types, and the use of organ cultures, have in certain situations resulted in greater sensitivity for recovery of viruses. Micro cell culture tests have been devised for virus identification and antibody assays; these are far more economical than conventional tests in terms of reagents, space requirements, and personnel time.

7604,Development of high-growth influenza H7N9 prepandemic candidate vaccine viruses in suspension MDCK cells,2020-04-02,"There is increasing interest in the development of new, ‘universal’ influenza vaccines (UIVs) that––unlike current vaccines––are effective against a broad range of seasonal influenza strains, as well as against novel pandemic viruses. While the existing literature discusses the potential epidemiological benefits of UIVs, it is also important to anticipate their potential unintended population consequences. Using mathematical modelling, we illustrate two such types of adverse consequences. First, by reducing the amount of infection-induced immunity in a population without fully replacing it, a seasonal UIV programme may permit larger pandemics than in the absence of vaccination. Second, the more successful a future UIV programme is in reducing transmission of seasonal influenza, the more vulnerable the population could become to the emergence of a vaccine escape variant. These risks could be mitigated by optimal deployment of any future UIV vaccine: namely, the use of a combined vaccine formulation (incorporating conventional as well as multiple universal antigenic targets) and achieving sufficient population coverage to compensate for any reductions in infection-induced immunity. In the absence of large-scale trials of UIVs, disease-dynamic models can provide helpful, early insights into their potential impact. In future, data from continuing vaccine development will be invaluable in developing robustly predictive modelling approaches.","Arinaminpathy, N.; Riley, S.; Barclay, W.

7639,Endocrinology and paracrinology: Cell surface peptidases in human endometrium,1996-06-11,A dot blot hybridization assay is described for the detection and differentiation of porcine rotavirus serotypes. Recombinant complementary DNA (cDNA) representing gene 9 (the gene encoding the neutralization antigens in VP7 glycoprotein) from OSU (porcine rotavirus serotype 1) and Gottfried (porcine rotavirus serotype 2) strains were used to determine the optimal hybridization conditions which allow specific detection of group A porcine rotaviruses. Probes were prepared by excision of the inserts from the recombinant plasmids and radiolabeling of cDNA with (32)P by the random primer extension method. Probes were hybridized at various stringencies with viral RNA from different rotavirus serotypes bound to nylon membranes. Hybridization at low stringency (26% base pair mismatch for stable hybrid formation) had high sensitivity but low specificity. Hybridization at high stringency (16% base pair mismatch for stable hybrid formation) produced high specificity but decreased the sensitivity observed at low stringency. Probes were specific for rotavirus at both stringencies and did not hybridize with nucleic acids from other porcine viruses. Subgenomic gene 9 fragments were then tested to provide more specific probes. A 322 bp fragment from OSU gene 9 between nucleotides 382 and 704 and a 266 bp fragment from Gottfried gene 9 between nucleotides 230 and 496 were found to be specific as hybridization probes. These studies demonstrated the feasibility of the dot blot hybridization assay using subgenomic fragments of gene 9 to detect and differentiate serotypes of porcine rotavirus. Additional studies are warranted to further evaluate the sensitivity and the capability of these probes to detect porcine field isolates of the same serotype.,"Johnson, Michael E.; Paul, Prem S.; Gorziglia, Mario; Rosenbusch, Ricardo",Vet Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117278/,52

For instance, glucocorticoids are considered the most effective anti-inflammatory therapies for chronic inflammatory and immune diseases, such as asthma. But they are relatively ineffective in asthmatic smokers, and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or cystic fibrosis (CF). As such, the pharmaceutical industry is exploring new therapeutic approaches to address all major respiratory diseases. The previous chapters demonstrated the widespread influence of purinergic signaling on all pulmonary functions and defense mechanisms. In Chap. 8, we described animal studies which highlighted the critical role of aberrant purinergic activities in the development and maintenance of chronic airway diseases.

Although constitutive, the innate immune system is activated by the presence of microbes or their products, providing a rationale for a potential biodefense strategy. Both prophylactic and postexposure strategies involving innate immune stimulation have been shown to be plausible to prevent or ameliorate infections in animal models. Innate immune-activating compounds based on conserved microbial components recognized by toll-like molecules and other receptors could be synthesized and delivered like drugs by using an entirely different strategy from conventional vaccination. However, important theoretic and practical questions emerge about developing and deploying innate immune protective strategies for biodefense. This rostrum discusses prospects and problems in the overall approach itself. Important topics include microbe-specific issues about innate immune system effectiveness against highly virulent pathogens and general questions, such as whether innate immune responses will be safe and effective if used in a diverse human population of different age groups and with different genetic makeups.","Hackett, Charles J",J Allergy Clin Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7125525/,52

These demyelinating diseases appear to arise from complex interactions of genetic, immunological, infective, and biochemical mechanisms. While circumstances of MS etiology remain hypothetical, one persistent theme involves recognition by the immune system of myelin-specific antigens derived from myelin basic protein (MBP), the most abundant extrinsic myelin membrane protein, and/or another equally susceptible myelin protein or lipid component. Knowledge of the biochemical and physical—chemical properties of myelin proteins and lipids, particularly their composition, organization, structure, and accessibility with respect to the compacted myelin multilayers, thus becomes central to the understanding of how and why these antigens become selected during the development of MS. This review focuses on current understanding of the molecular basis underlying demyelinating disease as it may relate to the impact of the various protein and lipid components on myelin morphology; the precise molecular architecture of this membrane as dictated by protein—lipid and lipid—lipid interactions; and the relationship, if any, between the protein/lipid components and the destruction of myelin in pathological situations.","Deber, Charles M.; Reynolds, Steven J.",Clin Biochem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130177/,52

RNA-1 directs the synthesis of 88-kDa (p88), 57-kDa (p57), 37-kDa (p37), and 27-kDa (p27) polypeptides and RNA-2 a 35-kDa (p35) polypeptide in vitro. The coding order of the RNA-1 products was determined to be 5′-p27-p57-p37-3′. Antibodies to synthetic peptides representing the carboxyl terminal portions of p27 and p57 immunoprecipitated their respective polypeptides in addition to p88, suggesting that p88 is a fusion protein. A frameshift heptanucleotide sequence element has been identified in RCNMV RNA-1. In addition, a stable stem-loop secondary structure adjacent to the heptanucleotide sequence is predicted. Together, these sequence elements suggest that a ribosomal frameshifting event occurs which allows translational readthrough of the p27 open reading frame into the p57 open reading frame, generating the observed p88 product. An RNA-1 expression construct fusing the p57 and the CP open reading frame was engineered to investigate the ribosomal frameshifting event. CP antibodies immunoprecipitated a fusion protein of the predicted size containing the carboxyl portion of CP. Site-directed mutagenesis of the frameshift element indicates that in vitro, p88 can also be expressed alternatively by suppression of an amber termination codon. Based on these data, we propose that the putative RCNMV RNA polymerase is an 88-kDa polypeptide expressed by a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism similar to those utilized by retroviruses.","Xiong, Z.; Kim, K.H.; Kendall, T.L.; Lommel, S.A.",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131720/,52

The illness may be life-threatening, particularly in the very young and very old. Control of gastroenteritis associated with microbial infection is therefore an important aspect of preventive medicine. Laboratory investigations are necessary to establish the source of an outbreak, to determine whether chemotherapy is necessary as it is in, for example, Giardia lamblia infection and to identify long-term changes in the pattern of infections related to altered dietary habits and other social factors. In this survey we draw attention to the many infective agents which have to be considered in the investigation of cases and outbreaks of gastroenteritis. The examination of faecal samples in the microbiology laboratory is becoming increasingly complex requiring as it does the use of additional new techniques for previously unrecognised bacterial, viral and protozoal causes of gastroenteritis including, in the last two decades, Campylobacter, Clostridium difficile, rotavirus, Norwalk virus and Cryptosporidium. These investigations are however expensive and in the face of increasing pressure to economise, it is of paramount importance that the best use should be made of the resources available. To this end we make recommendations about the information that should accompany faecal and other samples submitted to the laboratory from outbreaks of gastroenteritis.","Turner, G.C.; Anderson, R.

Translational regulation is predominantly exerted during the initiation phase that is considered to be the rate-limiting step. Two types of translational regulation can be distinguished: global, in which the initiation rate of (nearly) all cellular messenger RNA (mRNA) is controlled and selective, in which the translation rate of specific mRNAs varies in response to the biological stimuli. In most cases of global regulation, control is exerted via the phosphorylation state of certain initiation factors, whereas only a few examples of selective regulation have been characterized well enough to define the underlying molecular events. Interestingly, cis-acting regulatory sequences, affecting translation initiation, have been found not only in the 5’UTRs of selectively regulated mRNAs, but also in the 3’UTRs. Thus, in addition to the protein encoding open reading frames, both the 5’ and 3’UTRs of mRNAs must be considered for their effect on translation.","Pantopoulos, Kostas; Johansson, Hans E.; Hentze, Matthias W.",Prog Nucleic Acid Res Mol Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133200/,52

The hallmark of its pathology is the demyelinated plaque with reactive glial scar formation. However, a detailed analysis of the patterns of demyelination, oligodendroglia cell pathology and the reaction of other tissue components suggests that the pathogenesis of myelin destruction in this disease may be heterogeneous. In this review we present a new classification scheme of lesional activity on the basis of the molecular composition of myelin degradation products in macrophages. When these criteria are used, different patterns of demyelination can be distinguished, including demyelination with relative preservation of oligodendrocytes, myelin destruction with concomitant and complete destruction of oligodendrocytes or primary destruction or disturbance of myelinating cells with secondary demyelination. Furthermore, in some cases a primary selective demyelination may be followed by secondary oligodendrocyte loss in the established lesions. Finally, some extraordinarily severe conditions may result in destructive lesions with loss of myelin, oligodendrocytes, axons and astro‐cytes. This heterogeneity of plaque pathology is discussed in the context of recent experimental models of inflammatory demyelination, which show that different immunological pathways may lead to the formation of demyelinated plaques that reveal the diverse structural aspects described above. Our data indicate, that the demyelinated plaques of multiple sclerosis may reflect a common pathological end point of a variety of different immunological mechanisms of myelin destruction in this disease.","Lucchinetti, Claudia F.; Brück, Wolfgang; Rodriguez, Moses; Lassmann, Hans",Brain Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161824/,52

Reactions of either magnesium dialkyls or the β‐diketiminate complex [HC{(Me)CN(Dipp)}(2)MgnBu] with four or two equivalents of Me(2)NHBH(3), respectively, produce compounds containing the [H(3)BNMe(2)BH(2)Me(2)N](−) ion, which coordinates to the magnesium centers through Mg—N and Mg⋅⋅⋅HB interactions in both the solution and solid states. Thermolysis of these compounds at 60 °C produces the cyclic product [(H(2)BNMe(2))(2)] and, it is proposed, magnesium hydrido species by an unprecedented δ‐hydride elimination process. Calcium‐based species, although less reactive than their magnesium‐based counterparts, are found to engage in similar dehydrocoupling reactivity and to produce a similar distribution of products under thermally promoted catalytic conditions. A mechanism for these observations is presented that involves initial production and insertion of H(2)B=NMe(2) into polarized M—N bonds as the major B—N bond‐forming step. The efficacy of this insertion and subsequent β‐ or δ‐hydride elimination steps is proposed to be dependent upon the charge density and polarizing capability of the participating Group 2 center, providing a rationale for the observed differences in reactivity between magnesium and calcium.","Liptrot, David J.; Hill, Michael S.; Mahon, Mary F.; MacDougall, Dugald J.",Chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162034/,52

In both models, clinical disease is characterized by paralysis, while pathological changes consist of inflammatory demyelination. In both models there is a genetic influence on susceptibility/resistance to the development of disease. This has been thoroughly studied in TMEV infection, and it has been found to depend on both major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and non‐MHC genes. At least four genes have been so far identified. Because of this genetic influence, some strains of mice are more susceptible to both clinical and pathological changes than others, and susceptibility appears to best correlate with the ability of a certain murine strain to develop a delayed‐type hypersensitivity (DTH) response to viral antigens. We have also observed that even among mice which are equally susceptible clinically, striking differences may be seen under pathological examination. These consist of different gradients of severity of inflammation, particularly in regards to the macrophage component. There is an inverse relationship between the number of macrophages, and their length of stay in the CNS, and the ability of mice to remyelinate their lesions. The most severe lesions are in SJL/J mice, and remyelination in this strain is extremely poor. The least severe lesions in terms of macrophage invasion are in strains such as NZW and RIIIS/J, and these are able to remyelinate lesions very successfully. Murine chronic relapsing EAE (CR‐EAE) shows pathological changes in many ways similar to those in TMEV‐infected SJL/J mice, although less severe in terms of degrees of macrophage infiltration and tissue destruction. Mice with CR‐EAE have a correspondingly limited ability to remyelinate their lesions. In both models the pathology appears to be mediated through a DTH response. However, while in EAE the DTH response is clearly against neuroantigens, the response in TMEV infection is against the virus itself. The end result in both models would be that of myelin destruction through a lymphotoxincytokine‐mediated mechanism. The importance of the DTH response in both models is well illustrated by the effects of tolerance induction in EAE and TMEV infection to neuroantigens and virus, respectively. These are important models of human MS, since the current hypothesis is that a viral infection early in life, on the appropriate genetic background, may trigger a secondary misdirected immune response which could be directed either against myelin antigens and/or possible persistent virus(es). © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.","Dal Canto, Mauro C.; Melvold, Roger W.; Kim, Byung S.; Miller, Stephen D.",Microsc Res Tech,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166956/,52
10454,Inflammation: Patterns and new concepts,1999-10-26,"While significant advances that have been made in determining the role of viruses involved in various epizootics occurring in penned shrimp aquaculture, viral diseases will continue to plague the industry. A major obstacle to the study of these diseases is the lack of convenient and quantitative methodologies, such as in vitro cell culture systems to grow and study (characterize) the virus. A beginning has been made with the recent development of protocols for the consistent preparation of primary shrimp lymphoid cells, which were employed for the quanta1 assay of some of the shrimp viral pathogens. The primary cell lines have also been used to analyze the synthesis of viral proteins at the cellular level and to study viral pathogenesis. With the further successful development of additional primary cell lines from other shrimp tissues and the establishment of continuous diploid and transformed shrimp cell lines, this problem is being solved. The value of cell culture systems is becoming increasingly clear. They present several obvious advantages because (1) they are more cost effective, sensitive, and convenient than whole animals, particularly for rapid monitoring of infectivity, (2) they yield quantitatively reproducible results, and (3) viral growth kinetics, biochemical and genetic characteristics, and so on can be studied more easily. Their biggest potential use is in future molecular biology and genetic studies of shrimp viruses.","Loh, Philip C.; Tapay, Lourdes M.; Lu, Yuanan; Nadala, E.C.B.",Adv Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173261/,52

10597,Defining trained immunity and its role in health and disease,2020-03-04,"INTRODUCTION: Influenza in hospitalized intensive care unit (ICU) patients with respiratory failure is associated with 25% mortality, despite timely oseltamivir treatment. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alternative neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) regimens compared to standard of care in patients hospitalized for H1N1, H3N2, or B influenza. METHODS: The Cochrane collaboration searching methods were followed in Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Web of Science databases (2009–2019). Eligibility criteria were RCTs comparing different regimens of NAIs in hospitalized patients (at least 1 year old) for clinically diagnosed influenza (H1N1, H3N2, or B). Pre-defined endpoints were time to clinical resolution (TTCR), overall mortality, hospital discharge, viral clearance, drug-related adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events. RESULTS: Seven trials (1579 patients) were included. Two trials compared two regimens of oral oseltamivir therapy, and one trial compared two regimens of intravenous zanamivir therapy vs oral oseltamivir therapy. Four trials focused on intravenous peramivir therapy: two trials compared two different regimens and two trials compared two different regimens vs oral oseltamivir therapy. Overall, the different regimens were well tolerated, with no significant differences in AEs; nonetheless non-significant differences were reported among different regimens regarding TTCR, mortality, and viral clearance. CONCLUSION: Higher compared to standard doses of NAIs or systemic peramivir therapy compared to oral oseltamivir therapy did not demonstrate benefit.

10749,Ingestion of sugar beet fiber enhances irradiation-induced aberrant crypt foci in the rat colon under an apoptosis-suppressed condition,1999-06-01,"Rho GTPase-activating proteins (RhoGAPs) have been reported to be of great importance in the initiation and development of many different cancers. However, their biological roles and regulatory mechanisms in lung cancer development and progression are poorly defined. Real-time PCR or western blotting analysis was used to detect Rho GTPase-activating protein 24 (ARHGAP24), WWP2, p27, p-STAT6 and STAT6 expression levels as well as the activity of RhoA and Rac1 in lung cancer. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle were measured by CCK-8 and flow cytometry analysis. Tumor growth of lung cancer cells was measured using a nude mouse xenograft experiment model in vivo. The correlation between WWP2 and p27 was measured by co-immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination analysis. We found that ARHGAP24 expression was lower in lung cancer tissues collected from the The Cancer Genome Atlas and independent hospital database. Overexpression of ARHGAP24 significantly suppressed cell proliferation and the activity of RhoA and Rac1, induced cell apoptosis and arrested cell cycle at the G(0)–G(1) phase. ARHGAP24 overexpression also inhibited tumor growth in nude mice, whereas knockdown of ARHGAP24 significantly promoted cell proliferation and WWP2 expression and inhibited cell cycle arrest at G(1) phase through activating STAT6 signaling. ARHGAP24 overexpression inhibited WWP2 overexpression-induced cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and the decreased p27 expression. Moreover, WWP2 was found interacted with p27, and WWP2 overexpression promoted the ubiquitination of p27. In conclusion, our findings suggest that ARHGAP24 inhibits cell proliferation and cell cycle progression and induces cell apoptosis of lung cancer via a STAT6-WWP2-p27 axis.","Wang, Lei; Shen, Saie; Xiao, Haibo; Ding, Fangbao; Wang, Mingsong; Li, Guoqing; Hu, Fengqing",Carcinogenesis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7197742/,52

Here, we developed a rapid, specific and sensitive visual detection of sea using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) combined with nanogold probe (AuNP) or styryl dye (STR). LAMP-AuNP and LAMP-STR can detect as low as 9.7 fg (3.2 sea copies) and 7.2 sea copies, respectively, which were lower than PCR (97 fg or 32 sea copies). The excellent performance of these new assays was demonstrated in food samples using crude DNA lysates. While the culture method detected 10(4) CFU/g in ground pork and 10 CFU/mL in milk in 5–7 days, LAMP-AuNP could detect down to 10 CFU/g for both samples in 27 minutes. Analyzing 80 pork and milk samples revealed that the LAMP-AuNP showed 100% sensitivity, 97–100% specificity and 97.5–100% accuracy, which were superior to the culture method, and comparable to PCR but without requirement of a thermal cycler. Furthermore, our LAMP-AuNP detect sea at a range below the food safety control (<100 CFU/g). The LAMP-STR quantitated sea in 10–1,000 CFU (7.2–720 copies). Our crude DNA lysis combined with LAMP-AuNP/STR present effective point-of-care detection and facilitate appropriate control strategies.","Srimongkol, Grittaya; Ditmangklo, Boonsong; Choopara, Ilada; Thaniyavarn, Jiraporn; Dean, Deborah; Kokpol, Sirirat; Vilaivan, Tirayut; Somboonna, Naraporn",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7211006/,52

Many pathogens manipulate the ubiquitin system to evade these defenses. Here we characterize a likely effector protein bearing a deubiquitylase (DUB) domain from the obligate intracellular bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi, the causative agent of scrub typhus. The Ulp1-like DUB prefers ubiquitin substrates over ubiquitin-like proteins and efficiently cleaves polyubiquitin chains of three or more ubiquitins. The co-crystal structure of the DUB (OtDUB) domain with ubiquitin revealed three bound ubiquitins: one engages the S1 site, the second binds an S2 site contributing to chain specificity and the third binds a unique ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD). The UBD modulates OtDUB activity, undergoes a pronounced structural transition upon binding ubiquitin, and binds monoubiquitin with an unprecedented ~5 nM dissociation constant. The characterization and high-resolution structure determination of this enzyme should aid in its development as a drug target to counter Orientia infections.","Berk, Jason M.; Lim, Christopher; Ronau, Judith A.; Chaudhuri, Apala; Chen, Hongli; Beckmann, John F.; Loria, J.

11007,Recombination Between High-Risk Human Papillomaviruses and Non-Human Primate Papillomaviruses: Evidence of Ancient Host Switching Among Alphapapillomaviruses,2020-05-08,"Haemonchus contortus has evolved highly integrated and sophisticated mechanisms to promote coexistence with hosts. The excretory-secretory (ES) products generated by this parasite contribute to the regulation of the host immune response to facilitate immune evasion and induce chronicity, but the proteins responsible for this process and the exact cellular mechanisms have yet to be defined. In this study, we identified 114 H. contortus ES proteins (HcESPs) interacting with host T cells and 15 T cell binding receptors via co-immunoprecipitation and shotgun liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Based on bioinformatics analysis, we demonstrated that HcESPs could inhibit T cell viability, induce cell apoptosis, suppress T cell proliferation and cause cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, the stimulation of HcESPs exerted critical control effects on T cell cytokine production profiles, predominantly promoting the secretion of interleukin (IL)-10, IL-17A and transforming growth factor-β1 and inhibiting IL-2, IL-4 and interferon-γ production. Collectively, these findings may provide insights into the interaction between ES proteins and key host effector cells, enhancing our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying parasite immune evasion and providing new clues for novel vaccine development.","Lu, Mingmin; Tian, Xiaowei; Yang, Zhang; Wang, Wenjuan; Tian, Ai-Ling; Li, Charles; Yan, Ruofeng; Xu, Lixin; Song, Xiaokai; Li, Xiangrui",Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222441/,52

Important questions about neurological sequelae and quality of life after LT have emerged. In this review, we discuss the neurocognitive changes associated with LT and we conclude with recommendations in this regard for patients, caregivers, and physicians. RECENT FINDINGS: Compared with other solid organ recipients, LT patients tend to have a higher incidence (up to 30%) of neurological complications post-LT. Even in absence of previous episodes of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), some patients display new onset of neurological symptoms post-LT, raising the concern about the role of other factors that may have a direct impact on cognitive function. SUMMARY: Different mechanisms have been postulated to explain these postoperative neurological symptoms. They include sequelae of HE, persistent impairment of cognitive function due to cirrhosis, or postoperative decompensation of an unknown or undiagnosed neurodegenerative disorder.","Albhaisi, Somaya A.

Optimal techniques to minimize complications remain controversial. Here, we report a retrospective review of the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) Participant User Files (PUF) database, comparing outcomes between revision RBS and LBS. METHODS: The 2015 and 2016 MBSAQIP PUF database was retrospectively reviewed. Revision cases were identified using the Revision/Conversion Flag. Selected cases were further stratified by surgical approach. Subgroup analysis of sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass cases was performed. Case–controlled matching (1:1) was performed of the RBS and LBS cohorts, including gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy cohorts separately. Cases and controls were match by demographics, ASA classification, and preoperative comorbidities. RESULTS: 26,404 revision cases were identified (93.3% LBS, 6.7% RBS). 85.6% were female and 67% white. Mean age and BMI were 48 years and 40.9 kg/m(2). 1144 matched RBS and LBS cases were identified. RBS was associated with longer operative duration (p < 0.0001), LOS (p = 0.0002) and a higher rate of ICU admissions (1.3% vs 0.5%, p = 0.05). Aggregate bleeding and leak rates were higher in the RBS cohort. In both gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy cohorts, the robotic-assisted surgery remain associated with longer operative duration (p < 0.0001). In gastric bypass, rates of aggregate leak and bleeding were higher with robotic surgery, while transfusion was higher with laparoscopy. For sleeve gastrectomy cases, reoperation, readmission, intervention, sepsis, organ space SSI, and transfusion were higher with robotic surgery. CONCLUSION: In this matched cohort analysis of revision bariatric surgery, both approaches were overall safe. RBS was associated with longer operative duration and higher rates of some complications. Complications were higher in the robotic sleeve cohort. Robotic is likely less cost-effective with no clear patient safety benefit, particularly for sleeve gastrectomy cases.","Acevedo, Edwin; Mazzei, Michael; Zhao, Huaqing; Lu, Xiaoning; Edwards, Michael A.",Surg Endosc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223848/,52

11653,A guide to cancer immunotherapy: from T cell basic science to clinical practice,2020-05-20,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Neurostimulants may improve or accelerate cognitive and functional recovery after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), ischemic stroke (IS), or subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), but few studies have described their safety and effectiveness in the intensive care unit (ICU). The objective of this study was to describe amantadine and modafinil administration practices during acute stroke care starting in the ICU and to evaluate safety and effectiveness. METHODS: Consecutive adult ICU patients treated with amantadine and/or modafinil following acute non-traumatic IS, ICH, or SAH were evaluated. Neurostimulant administration data were extracted from the electronic medication administration record, including medication (amantadine, modafinil, or both), starting dose, time from stroke to initiation, and whether the neurostimulant was continued at hospital discharge. Patients were considered responders if they met two of three criteria within 9 days of neurostimulant initiation: increase in Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score ≥ 3 points from pre-treatment baseline, improved wakefulness or participation documented in caregiver notes, or clinical improvement documented in physical or occupational therapy notes. Potential confounders of the effectiveness assessment and adverse drug effects were also recorded. RESULTS: A total of 87 patients were evaluable during the 3.7-year study period, including 41 (47%) with ICH, 29 (33%) with IS, and 17 (20%) with SAH. The initial neurostimulant administered was amantadine in 71 (82%) patients, modafinil in 13 (15%), or both in 3 (3%) patients. Neurostimulants were initiated a median of 7 (4.25, 12.75) days post-stroke (range 1–27 days) for somnolence (77%), not following commands (32%), lack of eye opening (28%), or low GCS (17%). The most common starting dose was 100 mg twice daily for both amantadine (86%) and modafinil (54%). Of the 79 patients included in the effectiveness evaluation, 42 (53%) were considered responders, including 34/62 (55%) receiving amantadine monotherapy and 8/24 (33%) receiving both amantadine and modafinil at the time they met the definition of a responder. No patient receiving modafinil monotherapy was considered a responder. The median time from initiation to response was 3 (2, 5) days. Responders were more frequently discharged home or to acute rehabilitation compared to non-responders (90% vs 62%, p = 0.006). Among survivors, 63/72 (88%) were prescribed a neurostimulant at hospital discharge. The most common potential adverse drug effect was sleep disruption (16%). CONCLUSIONS: Neurostimulant administration during acute stroke care may improve wakefulness. Future controlled studies with a neurostimulant administration protocol, prospective evaluation, and discretely defined response and safety criteria are needed to confirm these encouraging findings.

The external bidimensional factor of familiarity with digital tools, which is not usually explained by the TAM, was included, and evaluated. Following a four-stage scale development technique, a seven-dimensional 25-item survey was developed, which includes two external correlated variables: familiarity with high-tech digital tools and familiarity with traditional digital tools, two mediator variables—computer anxiety, and perceived barriers, and three response variables, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and intention to use. The initial version of the survey was administered on 250 undergraduate students. Next, for another sample of 206 students, latent dimensions of the survey were tested using exploratory factor analysis. The structure of the survey was validated in two other subsequent stages with one sample of 262 responses of undergraduates and one of 310 responses of master's students from two different universities. All students who agreed to participate in research attended blended learning. The validity, reliability and invariance of the instrument were established by psychometric analyses. Collected data indicated that the survey has an adequate multifactorial structure that is reliable and invariant across degree levels. The scale is recommended for use in higher education studies targeting the promotion of blended learning and reduction of negative attitudes of learners toward digital instruments, supporting university professors to select their own efficient way to teach.","Lazar, Iuliana Mihaela; Panisoara, Georgeta; Panisoara, Ion Ovidiu",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7351189/,52

Salivary secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) is a basic pillar of local immunity in the first line of defense. Altered salivary sialoglycoprotein carbohydrates are important in the pathologies in the oral cavity including inflammation, infection and neoplasia. Therefore, we assessed whether changes in the salivary and serum IgA glycosylation correlated with development and severity of oral mucositis. Methods: Using capillary electrophoresis, comparative analysis of serum and salivary IgA total N-glycans was conducted in 8 patients with autologous peripheral stem-cell transplantation (APSCT) at four different stages of transplantation (day −3/−7, 0, +7, +14) and in 10 healthy controls. Results: Fourteen out of the 31 structures identified in serum and 6 out of 38 in saliva showed significant changes upon transplantation compared with the control group. Only serum core fucosylated, sialylated bisecting biantennary glycan (FA2BG2S2) showed significant differences between any two stages of transplantation (day −3/−7 and day +14; p = 0.0279).

A recent article challenges this notion by arguing that when both the president and his or her justice minister share the same party—i.e., they are copartisans—that state is less likely to protect human rights, as justice ministers may value their loyalty to the president over their duty to enforce court decisions. In this article, I estimate government respect for human rights accounting for both copartisan justice ministers and an independent judiciary. In the end, I find copartisan justice ministers to be negatively associated with high government respect for human rights, even after controlling for judicial independence. Many constitutions already seek to ensure an independent judiciary, but if copartisan justice ministers increase the likelihood that governments repress, then perhaps constitutional engineers should also consider options that would reduce the likelihood that both the president and his or her justice minister share the same party.","Holzer, Joshua",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7467281/,52
13416,Applications of Genome-Wide Screening and Systems Biology Approaches in Drug Repositioning,2020-09-21,"IMPORTANCE: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are frequently used to deliver intravenous antimicrobial therapy. However, inappropriate PICC use may lead to patient harm. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether infectious disease physician approval prior to PICC placement for intravenous antimicrobials is associated with more appropriate device use and fewer complications. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study of 21 653 PICCs placed for a primary indication of intravenous antimicrobial therapy between January 1, 2015, and July 26, 2019, was conducted in 42 hospitals participating in a quality collaborative across Michigan among hospitalized medical patients. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Appropriateness of PICCs was defined according to the Michigan Appropriateness Guide for Intravenous Catheters as a composite measure of (1) single-lumen catheter use, (2) avoiding use of PICCs for 5 days or less, and (3) avoiding use of PICCs for patients with chronic kidney disease (defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate <45 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). Complications related to PICCs included catheter occlusion, deep vein thrombosis, and central line–associated bloodstream infection. The association between infectious disease physician approval, device appropriateness, and catheter complications was assessed using multivariable models, adjusted for patient comorbidities and hospital clustering. Results were expressed as odds ratios with 95% CIs. RESULTS: A total of 21 653 PICCs were placed for intravenous antimicrobials (11 960 PICCs were placed in men [55.2%]; median age, 64.5 years [interquartile range, 53.4-75.4 years]); 10 238 PICCs (47.3%) were approved by an infectious disease physician prior to placement. Compared with PICCs with no documented approval, PICCs with approval by an infectious disease physician were more likely to be appropriately used (72.7% [7446 of 10 238] appropriate with approval vs 45.4% [5180 of 11 415] appropriate without approval; odds ratio, 3.53; 95% CI, 3.29-3.79; P < .001). Furthermore, approval was associated with lower odds of a PICC-related complication (6.5% [665 of 10 238] with approval vs 11.3% [1292 of 11 415] without approval; odds ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.50-0.61). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study suggests that, when PICCs were placed for intravenous antimicrobial therapy, infectious disease physician approval of PICC insertion was associated with more appropriate device use and fewer complications. Policies aimed at ensuring infectious disease physician approval prior to PICC placement for antimicrobials may improve patient safety.","Vaughn, Valerie M.; O’Malley, Megan; Flanders, Scott A.; Gandhi, Tejal N.; Petty, Lindsay A.; Malani, Anurag N.; Weinmann, Allison; Horowitz, Jennifer K.; Chopra, Vineet",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7578772/,52

13530,Induction of Chicken Host Defense Peptides within Disease-Resistant and -Susceptible Lines,2020-10-14,"Decoration proteins are viral accessory gene products that adorn the surfaces of some phages and viral capsids, particularly tailed dsDNA phages. These proteins often play a “cementing” role, reinforcing capsids against accumulating internal pressure due to genome packaging, or environmental insults such as extremes of temperature or pH. Many decoration proteins serve alternative functions, including target cell recognition, participation in viral assembly, capsid size determination, or modulation of host gene expression. Examples that currently have structures characterized to high-resolution fall into five main folding motifs: β-tulip, β-tadpole, OB-fold, Ig-like, and a rare knotted α-helical fold. Most of these folding motifs have structure homologs in virus and target cell proteins, suggesting horizontal gene transfer was important in their evolution. Oligomerization states of decoration proteins range from monomers to trimers, with the latter most typical. Decoration proteins bind to a variety of loci on capsids that include icosahedral 2-, 3-, and 5-fold symmetry axes, as well as pseudo-symmetry sites. These binding sites often correspond to “weak points” on the capsid lattice. Because of their unique abilities to bind virus surfaces noncovalently, decoration proteins are increasingly exploited for technology, with uses including phage display, viral functionalization, vaccination, and improved nanoparticle design for imaging and drug delivery. These applications will undoubtedly benefit from further advances in our understanding of these versatile augmenters of viral functions.","Dedeo, Corynne L.; Teschke, Carolyn M.; Alexandrescu, Andrei T.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7602432/,52

To model the brain tumor microenvironment in a reproducible and scalable system, we developed a rapid three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting method to construct clinically relevant biomimetic tissue models. In recurrent glioblastoma, macrophages/microglia prominently contribute to the tumor mass. To parse the function of macrophages in 3D, we compared the growth of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) alone or with astrocytes and neural precursor cells in a hyaluronic acid-rich hydrogel, with or without macrophage. Bioprinted constructs integrating macrophage recapitulate patient-derived transcriptional profiles predictive of patient survival, maintenance of stemness, invasion, and drug resistance. Whole-genome CRISPR screening with bioprinted complex systems identified unique molecular dependencies in GSCs, relative to sphere culture. Multicellular bioprinted models serve as a scalable and physiologic platform to interrogate drug sensitivity, cellular crosstalk, invasion, context-specific functional dependencies, as well as immunologic interactions in a species-matched neural environment.","Tang, Min; Xie, Qi; Gimple, Ryan C.; Zhong, Zheng; Tam, Trevor; Tian, Jing; Kidwell, Reilly L.; Wu, Qiulian; Prager, Briana C.; Qiu, Zhixin; Yu, Aaron; Zhu, Zhe; Mesci, Pinar; Jing, Hui; Schimelman, Jacob; Wang, Pengrui; Lee, Derrick; Lorenzini, Michael H.; Dixit, Deobrat; Zhao, Linjie; Bhargava, Shruti; Miller, Tyler E.; Wan, Xueyi; Tang, Jing; Sun, Bingjie; Cravatt, Benjamin F.; Muotri, Alysson R.; Chen, Shaochen; Rich, Jeremy N.",Cell Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608409/,52
14052,Antibiotic Resistance Profiles and Molecular Mechanisms of Campylobacter From Chicken and Pig in China,2020-10-27,"The complete genome sequence of a novel circovirus (elk circovirus (ElkCV) Banff/2019) was determined via high throughput sequencing of liver tissue from a euthanized Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus canadensis nelsoni) from Alberta, Canada. The genome is circular and 1,787 nucleotides long, with two major ORFs encoding predicted proteins. Comparative genomic analysis to 4,164 publicly available complete and near complete circovirus genomes showed that ElkCV shares approximately 65% pairwise genome-wide nucleotide identity with the most closely related circovirus species, porcine circoviruses (PCV) 1 and 2 and bat-associated circovirus (BatACV) 11. ElkCV features a stem-loop within the origin of replication region characteristic of circoviruses. However, it differs from those found in PCV1, PCV2 and BatACV11 since it has a longer stem and contains hexamer repeats that overlap the stem in opposing orientations. Interestingly, stem-loop structures of similar length featuring repeats in a similar position and orientation are also seen in some avian circoviruses. Based on the demarcation threshold established by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) for members of Circoviridae (80% pairwise genome-wide nucleotide identity), ElkCV represents a novel species and is the first complete circovirus genome reported from a cervid host.","Fisher, Mathew; Harrison, Thomas M.

14154,"Development, Application, and Quality Control of Serology Assays Used for Diagnostic Monitoring of Laboratory Nonhuman Primates",2008-01-01,"ABSTRACT: Canine distemper virus (CDV) infection causes mass mortality in diverse carnivore species. For effective virus surveillance, rapid and sensitive assays are needed to detect CDV in field samples. In this study, after BABL/c mice were immunized with recombinant CDV-fusion (F) protein, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against recombinant CDV-F protein (designated 1A5, 1A6, and 7D5) were produced using traditional hybridoma cell technology. Next, capture antibody (1A6, 800 ng/well) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated detection antibody (HRP-7D5, 1:100, 500 ng/well) were used in a double monoclonal antibody–based sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for CDV detection after optimization of both mAb amounts per well using a checkerboard titration test. Based on sandwich ELISA test results for 120 known CDV-negative samples, the cutoff value for a positive result was set to an OD(450 nm) value ≥ 0.196. As compared with test results obtained from commercial immune colloidal gold test strips, the low limits of detection for the two assays were revealed to be 100 TCID(50) per 100 μL. In addition, the sandwich ELISA agreed 100% and 96.4% with commercial immune colloidal gold test strips when testing serum and stool samples. The sandwich ELISA assay provided statistically similar CDV detection. Thus, the sandwich ELISA developed here to detect CDV in fecal and serum samples provided good sensitivity, high specificity, and good reproducibility and should serve as an ideal method for large-scale surveillance of CDV infections in carnivores. KEY POINTS: • Three CDV mAbs that recognized different epitopes and bound to virion were generated. • The sandwich ELISA based mAbs to detect CDV in fecal and serum samples was developed. • The sandwich ELISA is an ideal method for detecting CDV infections in the field.","Zhang, Yuan; Xu, Gang; Zhang, Lu; Zhao, Jiakai; Ji, Pinpin; Li, Yaning; Liu, Baoyuan; Zhang, Jingfei; Zhao, Qin; Sun, Yani; Zhou, En-Min",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7671975/,52
14224,A Prominent Cell Manipulation Technique in BioMEMS: Dielectrophoresis,2020-11-03,"This article challenges the notion of the randomness of mutations in eukaryotic cells by unveiling stress-induced human non-random genome editing mechanisms. To account for the existence of such mechanisms, I have developed molecular concepts of the cell environment and cell environmental stressors and, making use of a large quantity of published data, hypothesised the origin of some crucial biological leaps along the evolutionary path of life on Earth under the pressure of natural selection, in particular, (1) virus–cell mating as a primordial form of sexual recombination and symbiosis; (2) Lamarckian CRISPR-Cas systems; (3) eukaryotic gene development; (4) antiviral activity of retrotransposon-guided mutagenic enzymes; and finally, (5) the exaptation of antiviral mutagenic mechanisms to stress-induced genome editing mechanisms directed at “hyper-transcribed” endogenous genes. Genes transcribed at their maximum rate (hyper-transcribed), yet still unable to meet new chronic environmental demands generated by “pollution”, are inadequate and generate more and more intronic retrotransposon transcripts. In this scenario, RNA-guided mutagenic enzymes (e.g., Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like enzymes, APOBECs), which have been shown to bind to retrotransposon RNA-repetitive sequences, would be surgically targeted by intronic retrotransposons on opened chromatin regions of the same “hyper-transcribed” genes. RNA-guided mutagenic enzymes may therefore “Lamarkianly” generate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and gene copy number variations (CNV), as well as transposon transposition and chromosomal translocations in the restricted areas of hyper-functional and inadequate genes, leaving intact the rest of the genome. CNV and SNP of hyper-transcribed genes may allow cells to surgically explore a new fitness scenario, which increases their adaptability to stressful environmental conditions. Like the mechanisms of immunoglobulin somatic hypermutation, non-random genome editing mechanisms may generate several cell mutants, and those codifying for the most environmentally adequate proteins would have a survival advantage and would therefore be Darwinianly selected. Non-random genome editing mechanisms represent tools of evolvability leading to organismal adaptation including transgenerational non-Mendelian gene transmission or to death of environmentally inadequate genomes. They are a link between environmental changes and biological novelty and plasticity, finally providing a molecular basis to reconcile gene-centred and “ecological” views of evolution.","Zamai, Loris",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7693803/,52
14255,Newly Developed System for the Robust Detection of Listeria monocytogenes Based on a Bioelectric Cell Biosensor,2020-11-17,"Maintenance of genome stability is a crucial priority for any organism. To meet this priority, robust signalling networks exist to facilitate error-free DNA replication and repair. These signalling cascades are subject to various regulatory post-translational modifications that range from simple additions of chemical moieties to the conjugation of ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs). Interferon Stimulated Gene 15 (ISG15) is one such UBL. While classically thought of as a component of antiviral immunity, ISG15 has recently emerged as a regulator of genome stability, with key roles in the DNA damage response (DDR) to modulate p53 signalling and error-free DNA replication. Additional proteomic analyses and cancer-focused studies hint at wider-reaching, uncharacterised functions for ISG15 in genome stability. We review these recent discoveries and highlight future perspectives to increase our understanding of this multifaceted UBL in health and disease.","Sandy, Zac; da Costa, Isabelle Cristine; Schmidt, Christine K.",Biomolecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7698331/,52

The changes in ventilation over time and optimal ventilatory management remains unknown. Newer, non-invasive technologies provide insight into these patterns. METHODS: This single-center prospective cohort study enrolled infants ≤32 0/7 weeks. We obtained epochs of transcutaneous carbon dioxide (TcCO(2)) measurements twice each week to describe the pattern of hypercarbia throughout their hospitalization. RESULTS: Patterns of hypercarbia varied based on birth gestational age and post-menstrual age (PMA) (p = 0.03), regardless of respiratory support. Infants receiving the most respiratory support had values 16–21 mmHg higher than those on room air (p < 0.001). Infants born at the youngest gestational ages had the greatest total change but the rate of change was slower (p = 0.049) compared to infants born at later gestational ages. All infants had TcCO(2) values stabilize by 31–33 weeks PMA, when values were not significantly different compared to discharge. No rebound was observed when infants weaned off invasive support. CONCLUSIONS: Hypercarbia improves as infants approached 31–33 weeks PMA. Hypercarbia was the highest in the most immature infants and improved with age and growth despite weaning respiratory support. IMPACT: This study describes the evolution of hypercarbia as very preterm infants grow and develop. The pattern of ventilation is significantly different depending on the gestational age at birth and post-menstrual age. Average transcutaneous carbon dioxide (TCO(2)) decreased over time as infants became more mature despite weaning respiratory support. This improvement was most significant in infants born at the lowest gestational ages.","Sullivan, Katherine P.; White, Heather O.; Grover, Lindsay E.; Negron, Jordi J.; Lee, Austin F.; Rhein, Lawrence M.",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7814526/,52

Previous studies have shown that NIV effectiveness depends on patient adherence and tolerance. The aim of this study was to determine the adherence and efficacy of VAPS-NIV compared to spontaneous-time (S/T) mode in pediatric patients with neuromuscular disease (NMD). METHODS: This was a prospective observational study. Children with NMD who utilized NIV at home for ≥ 3 months were recruited from the Long-term ventilation clinic at The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada, from July 1, 2015, to July 1, 2019. Baseline characteristics, date of initiation of NIV, and pulmonary function tests were recorded. Polysomnogram (PSG) data and adherence were recorded and analyzed comparing VAPS and S/T modes. RESULTS: Twenty children with NMD (17 male, 85%) were enrolled. The mean (SD) age at initiation of NIV was 11.6 ± 4.6 years. The median (IQR) duration of ventilation was 1.36 (0.80–2.98) years. The mean average daily usage and the median daily usage for VAPS mode and S/T mode were 8.4 ± 1.6 versus 7.2 ± 2.5 h (p = 0.012) and 8.6 ± 1.4 versus 7.8 ± 2.1 h (p = 0.022), respectively. There was no difference in sleep architecture, gas exchange, or parent proxy report of NIV tolerance between S/T and VAPS modes. CONCLUSION: VAPS was associated with an improvement in adherence to therapy in children with NMD compared to S/T mode.

14955,Modulation of Antigen Display on PapMV Nanoparticles Influences Its Immunogenicity,2021-01-08,"Several epidemiological studies and clinical trials have reported the beneficial effects of green tea, coffee, wine, and curry on human health, with its anti-obesity, anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, and neuroprotective properties. These effects, which have been supported using cell-based and animal studies, are mainly attributed to epigallocatechin gallate found in green tea, chlorogenic acid in coffee, resveratrol in wine, and curcumin in curry. Polyphenols are proposed to function via various mechanisms, the most important of which is related to reactive oxygen species (ROS). These polyphenols exert conflicting dual actions as anti- and pro-oxidants. Their anti-oxidative actions help scavenge ROS and downregulate nuclear factor-κB to produce favorable anti-inflammatory effects. Meanwhile, pro-oxidant actions appear to promote ROS generation leading to the activation of 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase, which modulates different enzymes and factors with health beneficial roles. Currently, it remains unclear how these polyphenols exert either pro- or anti-oxidant effects. Similarly, several human studies showed no beneficial effects of these foods, and, by extension polyphenols, on obesity. These inconsistencies may be attributed to different confounding study factors. Thus, this review provides a state-of-the-art update on these foods and their principal polyphenol components, with an assumption that it prevents obesity.","Ohishi, Tomokazu; Fukutomi, Ryuuta; Shoji, Yutaka; Goto, Shingo; Isemura, Mamoru",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7830344/,52

As so, new solutions to provide more efficient and affordable support to this group of patients are needed. Such solutions should never discard the user and instead should focus on promoting more healthy lifestyles and provide tools for patients’ active participation in the treatment and management of their diseases. In this concern, the Personal Health Empowerment (PHE) project presented in this paper aims to empower patients to monitor and improve their health, using personal data and technology assisted coaching. The work described in this paper focuses on defining an approach for user modelling on patients with chronic obstructive respiratory diseases using a hybrid modelling approach to identify different groups of users. A classification model with 90.4% prediction accuracy was generated combining agglomerative hierarchical clustering and decision tree classification techniques. Furthermore, this model identified 5 clusters which describe characteristics of 5 different types of users according to 7 generated rules. With the modelling approach defined in this study, a personalized coaching solution will be built considering patients with different necessities and capabilities and adapting the support provided, enabling the recognition of early signs of exacerbations and objective self-monitoring and treatment of the disease. The novel factor of this approach resides in the possibility to integrate personalized coaching technologies adapted to each kind of user within a smartphone-based application resulting in a reliable and affordable alternative for patients to manage their disease.","Martinho, Diogo; Freitas, Alberto; Sá-Sousa, Ana; Vieira, Ana; Meira, Jorge; Martins, Constantino; Marreiros, Goreti",J Med Syst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7847234/,52
15202,Diverse viral proteases activate the NLRP1 inflammasome,2021-01-07,"BACKGROUND: Endothelial dysfunction and injury is a major pathophysiologic feature of sepsis. Sepsis is also the most frequent cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients. Though most studies of AKI in sepsis have focused on tubular epithelial injury, the role of endothelial dysfunction and injury is less well studied. The goal of this study was first to investigate whether endothelial dysfunction and injury biomarkers were associated with severe AKI in sepsis patients. The second goal was to determine the best performing biomarker for severe AKI and whether this biomarker was associated with severe AKI across different etiologies of sepsis and clinical outcomes. METHODS: We studied adults with severe sepsis and acute respiratory failure (ARF) enrolled in the prospective observational Validating Acute Lung Injury markers for Diagnosis (VALID) study. Plasma endothelial dysfunction and injury biomarkers, including angiopoietin-2, soluble vascular endothelial cadherin (sVE-cadherin), endocan and syndecan-1, were measured at study enrollment. Primary analysis focused on the association between endothelial biomarker levels with severe AKI (defined as Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes [KDIGO] AKI stage 2 or 3), other organ dysfunctions (defined by Brussels organ failure scores), and comparison of pulmonary versus non-pulmonary sepsis. RESULTS: Among 228 sepsis patients enrolled, 141 developed severe AKI. Plasma levels of angiopoietin-2, endocan, sVE-cadherin, and syndecan-1 were significantly higher in sepsis patients with severe AKI compared to those without severe AKI. Among four endothelial biomarkers, only angiopoietin-2 was independently associated with severe AKI (odds ratio 6.07 per log increase, 95% CI 2.34–15.78, p < 0.001). Plasma angiopoietin-2 levels by quartile were significantly higher in sepsis patients with hepatic, coagulation, and circulatory failure. Plasma angiopoietin-2 levels were also significantly higher in patients with non-pulmonary sepsis compared to subjects with pulmonary sepsis. CONCLUSION: Among four biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and injury, angiopoietin-2 had the most robust independent association with development of severe AKI in patients with severe sepsis and ARF. Plasma angiopoietin-2 levels were also associated with other organ dysfunctions, non-pulmonary sepsis, and death. These findings highlight the importance of early endothelial dysfunction and injury in the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced AKI.","Yu, Wen-Kuang; McNeil, J.

Given the ubiquity of mobile phones, their use for health-care coupled with a biometric identification method, present a unique opportunity to address this challenge. Our research proposes an Android-based solution of an ear biometric tool for reliable identification. Unlike many popular biometric approaches (e.g., fingerprints, irises, facial recognition), ears are noninvasive and easily accessible on individuals across a lifespan. Our ear biometric tool uses a combination of hardware and software to identify a person using an image of their ear. The hardware supports an image capturing process that reduces undesired variability. The software uses a pattern recognition algorithm to transform an image of the ear into a unique identifier. We created three cross-sectional datasets of ear images, each increasing in complexity, with the final dataset representing our target use-case population of Zambian infants (N=224, aged 6days-6months). Using these datasets, we conducted a series of validation experiments, which informed iterative improvements to the system. Results of the improved system, which yielded high recognition rates across the three datasets, demonstrate the feasibility of an Android ear biometric tool as a solution to the persisting patient identification challenge.","Etter, Lauren; Simukanga, Alinani; Qin, Wenda; Pieciak, Rachel; Mwananyanda, Lawrence; Betke, Margrit; Phiri, Jackson; Carbo, Caroline; Hamapa, Arnold; Gill, Chris",Gates Open Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7887869/,52

DNA barcoding is commonly used to identify animal species. However, as a result of the historical hybridization of American bison and domestic cattle, additional genetic testing is required for species confirmation. The objective of this study was to perform a market survey of bison meat products and verify the species using DNA barcoding combined with polymerase chain reaction-satellite fragment length polymorphism (PCR-SFLP). Bison products (n = 45) were purchased from a variety of retailers. Samples that were positive for domestic cattle with DNA barcoding were further analyzed with PCR-SFLP. DNA barcoding identified bison in 41 products, red deer (Cervus elaphus) in one product, and domestic cattle in three products. PCR-SFLP confirmed the identification of domestic cattle in two samples, while the third sample was identified as bison with ancestral cattle DNA. Overall, mislabeling was detected in 3 of the 45 samples (6.7%). This study revealed that additional DNA testing of species that have undergone historical hybridization provides improved identification results compared to DNA barcoding alone.","Scales, Zerika M.; Narbay, Elif; Hellberg, Rosalee S.",Foods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7915063/,52

We will develop optimal ML models for each subpopulation stratified by sex and disease stages using sub scores from screening neurological tests. Data from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were used to build the ML models, for three groups: individuals with significant memory concern, early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and late MCI. Data were further separated into 6 groups by disease stage (3 levels) and sex (2 categories). The outcome was defined as the A[Formula: see text] status confirmed by the PET imaging, and the features include demographic data, newly identified risk factors, screening tests, and the domain scores from screening tests. Monte Carlo simulation studies were used together with k-fold cross-validation technique to compute model performance metric. We also develop a new feature selection method based on the stochastic ordering to avoiding searching all possible combinations of features. Accuracy of the identified optimal model for SMC male was over 90% by using domain scores, and accuracy for LMCI female was above 86%.

Importantly, combinations of drugs containing fentanyl, and propofol in isolation did not significantly depress MCC. Although no change in cilia length or percent ciliation was expected, we tried to correlate ex-vivo tracheal cilia ciliary beat frequency and cilia-generated flow velocities with MCC and found no correlation. Our results indicate that anesthetics containing ketamine (ketamine/xylazine and ketamine/dexmedetomidine) significantly depress MCC, while combinations containing fentanyl (fentanyl/isoflurane, fentanyl/midazolam/dexmedetomidine) and propofol do not. Our method for assessing MCC is reproducible and has utility for studying the effects of other drug combinations.","Feldman, Kyle S.; Kim, Eunwon; Czachowski, Michael J.; Wu, Yijen; Lo, Cecilia W.; Zahid, Maliha",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7921682/,52
15858,Myristoleic Acid Promotes Anagen Signaling by Autophagy through Activating Wnt/β-Catenin and ERK Pathways in Dermal Papilla Cells,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND: Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common systemic infection that is caused by an enterovirus, normally Coxsackie A16. Generally, it affects children or immunocompromised adults. Only a few reports have described pseudomembranous conjunctivitis associated with HFMD. We aim to describe the clinical outcomes and ocular findings of a 37-year-old female with HFMD and concurrent severe pseudomembranous conjunctivitis, who was 28 weeks pregnant. CASE PRESENTATION: A female patient who was 28-weeks pregnant was referred for an ophthalmological review due to pain and injection in both eyes. The patient was hospitalized under obstetrics and gynecology and evaluated for Behcet’s disease with oral and perineal ulcers. In an ophthalmic examination, both eyes were observed to have a conjunctival injection. Behcet’s disease-associated conjunctivitis was diagnosed. Topical steroids and antibiotics were administered every 6 h. Two days after her presentation, a maculopapular eruption occurred on her palms. Enterovirus type 71 was detected in a serum virus antibody test, and the patient was diagnosed with HFMD. After 7 days, severe pseudomembranous conjunctivitis and corneal epithelial defects occurred in both eyes. Topical steroids were administered every 3 h, and the pseudomembrane was removed every 2 to 3 days. The pseudomembrane did not occur after 3 weeks, but corneal erosion persisted. After 3 months, the corneal erosion had completely resolved. CONCLUSIONS: HFMD-associated conjunctivitis is a rare complication in adults, however it can appear as a severe pseudomembranous conjunctivitis. In this case, the removal of the pseudomembrane and topical steroids helped improve the symptoms.","Kim, Yoo Jin; Kim, Tae Gi",BMC Ophthalmol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7922717/,52
15911,Meta-Analysis of Gene Popularity: Less Than Half of Gene Citations Stem from Gene Regulatory Networks,2021-02-23,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of hospitalizations due to pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Substantial morbidity and socioeconomic burden are associated with RSV infection worldwide. Populations with higher susceptibility to developing severe RSV include premature infants, children with chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLDP) or congenital heart disease (CHD), elderly individuals aged > 65 years, and immunocompromised individuals. In the pediatric population, RSV can lead to long-term sequelae such as wheezing and asthma, which are associated with increased health care costs and reduced quality of life. Treatment for RSV is mainly supportive, and general preventive measures such as good hygiene and isolation are highly recommended. Although vaccine development for RSV has been a global priority, attempts to date have failed to yield a safe and effective product for clinical use. Currently, palivizumab is the only immunoprophylaxis (IP) available to prevent severe RSV in specific high-risk pediatric populations. Well-controlled, randomized clinical trials have established the efficacy of palivizumab in reducing RSV hospitalization (RSVH) in high-risk infants including moderate- to late-preterm infants. However, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), in its 2014 policy, stopped recommending RSV IP use for ≥ 29 weeks’ gestational age infants. Revisions to the AAP policy for RSV IP have largely narrowed the proportion of pediatric patients eligible to receive RSV IP and have been associated with an increase in RSVH and morbidity. On the other hand, after reviewing the recent evidence on RSV burden, the National Perinatal Association, in its 2018 clinical practice guidelines, recommended RSV IP use for a wider pediatric population. As the AAP recommendations drive insurance reimbursements for RSV IP, they should be revised to help further mitigate RSV disease burden.","Chatterjee, Archana; Mavunda, Kunjana; Krilov, Leonard R.",Infect Dis Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7928170/,52
15947,"Establishment, optimisation and quantitation of a bioluminescent murine infection model of visceral leishmaniasis for systematic vaccine screening",2020-03-13,"The phenylalanine–tyrosine–dopa–dopamine pathway provides dopamine to the brain. In this process, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the rate-limiting enzyme that hydroxylates tyrosine and generates levodopa (l-dopa) with tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)) as a coenzyme. Here, we show that oral berberine (BBR) might supply H(•) through dihydroberberine (reduced BBR produced by bacterial nitroreductase) and promote the production of BH(4) from dihydrobiopterin; the increased BH(4) enhances TH activity, which accelerates the production of l-dopa by the gut bacteria. Oral BBR acts in a way similar to vitamins. The l-dopa produced by the intestinal bacteria enters the brain through the circulation and is transformed to dopamine. To verify the gut–brain dialog activated by BBR’s effect, Enterococcus faecalis or Enterococcus faecium was transplanted into Parkinson’s disease (PD) mice. The bacteria significantly increased brain dopamine and ameliorated PD manifestation in mice; additionally, combination of BBR with bacteria showed better therapeutic effect than that with bacteria alone. Moreover, 2,4,6-trimethyl-pyranylium tetrafluoroborate (TMP-TFB)-derivatized matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) imaging of dopamine identified elevated striatal dopamine levels in mouse brains with oral Enterococcus, and BBR strengthened the imaging intensity of brain dopamine. These results demonstrated that BBR was an agonist of TH in Enterococcus and could lead to the production of l-dopa in the gut. Furthermore, a study of 28 patients with hyperlipidemia confirmed that oral BBR increased blood/fecal l-dopa by the intestinal bacteria. Hence, BBR might improve the brain function by upregulating the biosynthesis of l-dopa in the gut microbiota through a vitamin-like effect.","Wang, Yan; Tong, Qian; Ma, Shu-Rong; Zhao, Zhen-Xiong; Pan, Li-Bin; Cong, Lin; Han, Pei; Peng, Ran; Yu, Hang; Lin, Yuan; Gao, Tian-Le; Shou, Jia-Wen; Li, Xiao-Yang; Zhang, Xian-Feng; Zhang, Zheng-Wei; Fu, Jie; Wen, Bao-Ying; Yu, Jin-Bo; Cao, Xuetao; Jiang, Jian-Dong",Signal Transduct Target Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7902645/,52

However, it is unclear how presenteeism is affected by working styles in line with current corporate initiatives, such as reduced working hours, varied employment status, and flexible work arrangements. The purpose of this article was to investigate the association between work style and presenteeism. METHODS: This cross‐sectional study extracted data from employee profiles, employee attendance records, and a questionnaire in a large service sector company. Multiple linear regression was conducted to estimate the contributions of work style variables to the Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ) index score. RESULTS: In total, 21 500 participants were eligible for analysis. The WLQ index was lower for those working < 35 h/week (adjusted regression coefficient [ARC]:−0.35%; 95% CI: −0.48 to − 0.21) and higher for those working 40‐44 h/week or ≥ 45 h/week, compared with those working 35‐39 h/week. The position of team manager was positively associated with the WLQ index, whereas senior manager (ARC: −1.44%; 95% CI: −1.71 to − 1.17) and part‐time staff (ARC: −1.75%; 95% CI: −1.98 to − 1.52) positions were negatively associated with the WLQ index, compared with non‐managers. Those who worked remotely had significantly lower WLQ index scores (ARC: −0.61%; 95% CI: −0.95 to − 0.27). CONCLUSIONS: Reduced working hours and flexible work arrangements were associated with lower work limitations, which imply presenteeism, although additional research is necessary to verify these results.","Ishimaru, Tomohiro; Fujino, Yoshihisa",J Occup Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7938898/,52
16229,Revealing the high variability on nonconserved core and mobile elements of Austropuccinia psidii and other rust mitochondrial genomes,2021-03-11,"Wastewater based epidemiology (WBE) is increasingly used to provide decision makers with actionable data about community health. WBE efforts to date have primarily focused on sewer-transported wastewater in high-income countries, but at least 1.8 billion people in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) use onsite sanitation systems such as pit latrines and septic tanks. Like wastewater, fecal sludges from such systems offer similar advantages in community pathogen monitoring and other epidemiological applications. To evaluate the distribution of enteric pathogens inside pit latrines–which could inform sampling methods for WBE in LMIC settings unserved by sewers–we collected fecal sludges from the surface, mid-point, and maximum-depth of 33 pit latrines in urban and peri-urban Malawi and analyzed the 99 samples for 20 common enteric pathogens via multiplex quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Using logistic regression adjusted for household population, latrine sharing, the presence of a concrete floor or slab, water source, and anal cleansing materials, we found no significant difference in the odds of detecting the 20 pathogens from the mid-point (adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 1.1; 95% confidence interval = 0.73, 1.6) and surface samples (aOR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.54, 1.2) compared with those samples taken from the maximum depth. Our results suggest that, for the purposes of routine pathogen monitoring, pit latrine sampling depth does not strongly influence the odds of detecting enteric pathogens by molecular methods. A single sample from the pit latrines’ surface, or a composite of surface samples, may be preferred as the most recent material contributed to the pit and may be easiest to collect.","Capone, Drew; Chigwechokha, Petros; de los Reyes, Francis L.; Holm, Rochelle H.; Risk, Benjamin B.; Tilley, Elizabeth; Brown, Joe",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7954291/,52

The etiology of odontogenic tumors is not exactly determined and pathologists deal with challenges in diagnosis of odontogenic tumors because they are rare and obtained experiences are difficult to evaluate. In this study, we describe immunohistochemical and molecular markers in diagnosis of odontogenic tumors besides advanced diagnostic technique. Immunohistochemical features of odontogenic tumors beside the clinical features and radiological finding can help us to determine the correct diagnosis. Although these markers are neither specific nor sensitive enough, but analysis of gene expression provides definitive confirmation of diagnosis. In addition, “-omics” technology detected specific molecular alternation associated with etiology such as genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. The post transcriptional events such as DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling by histone modification affect the changes in epigenome. Furthermore, non-coding RNAs like micro-RNAs, long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and small non-coding RNA (snoRNA) play regulatory role and impact odontogenesis. Molecular marker propose their potential role in etiopathogenesis of odontogenic tumors and suitable candidate in diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches in addition to patient management. For future evaluations, organoid represents in vitro tumor model-study for tumor behavior, metastasis and invasion, drug screening, immunotherapy, clinical trial, hallmarks association with prognosis and evolution of personalized anti-cancer therapy. Moreover, organoid biobank help us to check genetic profile.

In 50–60% of pediatric patients, ITP is preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection 1–4 weeks before its onset. In this study, the relationship between the development of ITP and viral infections in children was assessed. We analyzed data of 6487 patients aged < 18 years with incident ITP from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Open Access Big Data Platform (2015 to 2018) and the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. The monthly positive detection rate (PDR) of seven respiratory and four acute diarrhea viruses was calculated. The virus PDR seasonal trend data was analyzed through ARIMA modeling. The ITP diagnostic data and prevalence of viral infection 1 and 2 months prior were analyzed using the Granger test. The overall male to female (M/F) ratio was 1.2, whereas it was 1.4 in the youngest age group (< 1 year). The overall ITP incidence rate was 18.1 per 100,000 person-years.

16777,Plasma membrane integrity: implications for health and disease,2021-04-13,"BACKGROUND: Severe bronchiolitis requiring mechanical ventilation was associated with an absence of surfactant activity and phosphatidylglycerol, causing airway obstruction in acute bronchiolitis. Exogen surfactant in mechanically ventilated infants decreased duration of stay in the intensive care unit and had favorable effects on oxygenation and carbon dioxide removal. This study aimed to evaluate the budget impact of surfactant therapy for bronchiolitis in critically ill infants in Colombia. METHODS: Budget impact analysis was performed to estimate the economic impact of surfactant therapy (ST) for the treatment of infants with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis, requiring mechanical ventilation. The analysis considered a 4-year time horizon and Colombian National Health System perspective. The model estimated drug costs associated with current scenario using humidified oxygen or adrenaline nebulization, and new scenario adding exogen surfactant. The size of the target population was calculated using epidemiological national data. Univariate one-way sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses were performed. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis the 4-year costs associated to ST and no-ST were estimated to be US$ 55,188,132 and US$ 55,972,082 respectively, indicating savings for Colombian National Health equal to US$ 783,950 if ST is adopted for the routine management of patients with bronchiolitis requiring mechanical ventilation. In the one-way sensitivity analysis, only increases in the cost of the surfactant drug and cost or length of stay in the pediatric intensive unit reduce the potential savings of ST. CONCLUSION: ST was cost-saving in emergency settings for treating infants with severe bronchiolitis requiring mechanical ventilation. This shift in treatment approach proved to be economically favorable in the Colombian context.","Buendía, Jefferson Antonio; Patiño, Diana Guerrero",BMC Health Serv Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8042831/,52

Thus, several different trimming strategies have been developed for identifying and removing these sites prior to phylogenetic inference. However, a recent study reported that doing so can worsen inference, underscoring the need for alternative alignment trimming strategies. Here, we introduce ClipKIT, an alignment trimming software that, rather than identifying and removing putatively phylogenetically uninformative sites, instead aims to identify and retain parsimony-informative sites, which are known to be phylogenetically informative. To test the efficacy of ClipKIT, we examined the accuracy and support of phylogenies inferred from 14 different alignment trimming strategies, including those implemented in ClipKIT, across nearly 140,000 alignments from a broad sampling of evolutionary histories. Phylogenies inferred from ClipKIT-trimmed alignments are accurate, robust, and time saving. Furthermore, ClipKIT consistently outperformed other trimming methods across diverse datasets, suggesting that strategies based on identifying and retaining parsimony-informative sites provide a robust framework for alignment trimming.","Steenwyk, Jacob L.; Buida, Thomas J.; Li, Yuanning; Shen, Xing-Xing; Rokas, Antonis",PLoS Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7735675/,52

We explored switching drug regimens to protease inhibitor (PI) based treatment and reducing nevirapine and zidovudine use in a differentiated community service delivery model in rural Zimbabwe. METHODS: From 2016 through 2018, we followed 306 children and adolescents on ART in Hurungwe, Zimbabwe at Chidamoyo Christian Hospital, which provides compact ART regimens at 8 dispersed rural community outreach sites. Viral load testing was performed (2016) by Roche and at follow-up (2018) by a point of care viral load assay. Virologic failure was defined as viral load ≥1,000 copies/ml. A logistic regression model which included demographics, treatment regimens and caregiver’s characteristics was used to assess risks for virologic failure and loss to follow-up (LTFU). RESULTS: At baseline in 2016, 296 of 306 children and adolescents (97%) were on first-line ART, and only 10 were receiving a PI-based regimen. The median age was 12 years (IQR 8–15) and 55% were female. Two hundred and nine (68%) had viral load suppression (<1,000 copies/ml) and 97(32%) were unsuppressed (viral load ≥1000). At follow-up in 2018, 42/306 (14%) were either transferred 23 (7%) or LTFU 17 (6%) and 2 had died. In 2018, of the 264 retained in care, 107/264 (41%), had been switched to second-line, ritonavir-boosted PI with abacavir as a new nucleotide analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI). Overall viral load suppression increased from 68% in 2016 to 81% in 2018 (P<0.001).

A short period of oxygen shortage after birth is quite normal for most babies and does not threaten their health. However, if babies have to suffer from a long period of oxygen shortage, then this condition is an indication of pathological fetal intolerance, which probably causes their death. The identification of the pathological fetal intolerance from the physical oxygen shortage is one of the important clinical problems in obstetrics for a long time. The clinical syndromes typically manifest five symptoms that indicate that the baby may suffer from fetal intolerance. At present, liquid biopsy combined with high-throughput sequencing or mass spectrum techniques provides a quick approach to detect real-time alteration in the peripheral blood at multiple levels with the rapid development of molecule sequencing technologies. Gene methylation is functionally correlated with gene expression; thus, the combination of gene methylation and expression information would help in screening out the key regulators for the pathogenesis of fetal intolerance. We combined gene methylation and expression features together and screened out the optimal features, including gene expression or methylation signatures, for fetal intolerance prediction for the first time. In addition, we applied various computational methods to construct a comprehensive computational pipeline to identify the potential biomarkers for fetal intolerance dependent on the liquid biopsy samples. We set up qualitative and quantitative computational models for the prediction for fetal intolerance during pregnancy. Moreover, we provided a new prospective for the detailed pathological mechanism of fetal intolerance. This work can provide a solid foundation for further experimental research and contribute to the application of liquid biopsy in antenatal care.","Zhang, Yu-Hang; Li, Zhandong; Zeng, Tao; Chen, Lei; Li, Hao; Gamarra, Margarita; Mansour, Romany F.; Escorcia-Gutierrez, José; Huang, Tao; Cai, Yu-Dong",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8062050/,52

Physical activity (PA) may soothe the inconveniences related to chronic diseases, has positive effects on the quality of life and biological rhythms, and can prevent the decline in motor functions and the consequent falls, which are associated with early death and disability in older adults. METHODS: We randomized 120 over-65 males and females into groups of similar size and timing and will give each either moderate physical activity or cultural and recreational activities. Being younger than 65 years, inability to participate in physical activity for any medical reason, and involvement in a massive program of physical exercise are the exclusion criteria. The primary outcome measures are: quality of life, walking speed, and postural sway. Participants are tested at baseline, post-treatment, and 6-month (24 weeks) and 12-month (48 weeks) follow-ups. DISCUSSION: This study aims at improving the quality of life, wellness, and cognitive functioning in the elderly through a low-cost affordable program of moderate physical activity.

Increased hypertension treatment coverage (the proportion of individuals initiated on treatment) and adherence (proportion of patients taking medicines as recommended) promise population health gains. However, governments and other payers will not invest in a large-scale hypertension control program unless it is both affordable and effective. OBJECTIVE: To investigate if a national hypertension control intervention implemented across the private and public sector facilities in India could save overall costs of CVD prevention and treatment. METHODS: We developed a discrete-time microsimulation model to assess the cost-effectiveness of population-level hypertension control intervention in India for combinations of treatment coverage and adherence targets. Input clinical parameters specific to India were obtained from large-scale surveys such as the Global Burden of Disease as well as local clinical trials. Input hypertensive medication cost parameters were based on government contracts. The model projected antihypertensive treatment costs, avoided CVD care costs, changes in disability-adjusted life year (DALYs) and incremental cost per DALY averted (represented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio or ICER) over 20 years. RESULTS: Over 20 years, at 70% coverage and adherence, the hypertension control intervention would avert 1.68% DALYs and be cost-saving overall. Increasing adherence (while keeping coverage constant) resulted in greater improvement in cost savings compared to increasing coverage (while keeping adherence constant). Results were most sensitive to the cost of antihypertensive medication, but the intervention remained highly cost-effective under all one-way sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: A national hypertension control intervention in India would most likely be budget neutral or cost-saving if the intervention can achieve and maintain high levels of both treatment coverage and adherence.","Das, Hemanshu; Moran, Andrew E.; Pathni, Anupam K.; Sharma, Bhawna; Kunwar, Abhishek; Deo, Sarang",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8121007/,52

The integrated application of Se(30) + Si(30) significantly increased plant growth (i.e., plant height 28.24%, number of tillers m(−2) 76.81%, fresh weight plant(−1) 80.66%, and dry weight plant(−1) 79.65%), Fv/Fm (44.78%), performance index (PI; 60.45%), membrane stability index (MSI; 36.39%), relative water content (RWC; 29.39%), total soluble sugars (TSS; 53.38%), proline (33.74%), enzymatic antioxidants (i.e., CAT activity by 14.45%, GR activity by 67.5%, SOD activity by 35.37% and APX activity by 39.25%) and non-enzymatic antioxidants (i.e., GSH content by 117.5%, AsA content by 52.32%), yield and its components (i.e., number of spikelets spike(−1) 29.55%, 1000-grain weight 48.73% and grain yield ha(−1) 26.44%). The anatomical traits of stem and leaves were improved in wheat plants treated with Se(30) + Si(30). These changes resulting from the exogenous applications of Se, Si or their combinations, in turn, make these elements prospective in helping wheat plants to acclimate successfully to saline soil.","Taha, Ragab S.; Seleiman, Mahmoud F.; Shami, Ashwag; Alhammad, Bushra Ahmed; Mahdi, Ayman H.

18594,Traditional medicines and their common uses in central region of Syria: Hama and Homs – an ethnomedicinal survey,2021-06-24,"Current procedures for inferring population history generally assume complete neutrality—that is, they neglect both direct selection and the effects of selection on linked sites. We here examine how the presence of direct purifying selection and background selection may bias demographic inference by evaluating two commonly-used methods (MSMC and fastsimcoal2), specifically studying how the underlying shape of the distribution of fitness effects and the fraction of directly selected sites interact with demographic parameter estimation. The results show that, even after masking functional genomic regions, background selection may cause the mis-inference of population growth under models of both constant population size and decline. This effect is amplified as the strength of purifying selection and the density of directly selected sites increases, as indicated by the distortion of the site frequency spectrum and levels of nucleotide diversity at linked neutral sites. We also show how simulated changes in background selection effects caused by population size changes can be predicted analytically. We propose a potential method for correcting for the mis-inference of population growth caused by selection. By treating the distribution of fitness effect as a nuisance parameter and averaging across all potential realizations, we demonstrate that even directly selected sites can be used to infer demographic histories with reasonable accuracy.","Johri, Parul; Riall, Kellen; Becher, Hannes; Excoffier, Laurent; Charlesworth, Brian; Jensen, Jeffrey D.",Mol Biol Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8233493/,52

METHODS: All children admitted to our level-1 trauma center from February 2012 to December 2018 following chest trauma were included in this retrospective study. RESULTS: A total of 75 patients with a median age of 11 [6–13] years, with thoracic injuries were included. Most patients also had extra-thoracic injuries (n = 71, 95%) and 59 (79%) had TBI. A total of 52 patients (69%) were admitted to intensive care and 31 (41%) were mechanically ventilated. In patients requiring mechanical ventilation, there was no difference in tidal volume or positive end-expiratory pressure in patients with moderate-to-severe TBI when compared with those with no-or-mild TBI. Only one patient developed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. A total of 6 patients (8%) died and all had moderate-to-severe TBI. CONCLUSION: In this small retrospective series, most patients requiring mechanical ventilation following chest trauma had associated moderate-to-severe TBI. Mechanical ventilation to manage TBI does not seem to be associated with more acute respiratory distress syndrome occurrence.","Baud, Caroline; Crulli, Benjamin; Evain, Jean-Noël; Isola, Clément; Wroblewski, Isabelle; Bouzat, Pierre; Mortamet, Guillaume",Pediatr Surg Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8260569/,52

19402,Interdigitated Electrode Biosensor Based on Plasma-Deposited TiO(2) Nanoparticles for Detecting DNA,2021-06-29,"Autophagy, apoptosis, and the unfolded protein response (UPR) are fundamental biological processes essential for manifold cellular functions in health and disease. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and lethal pulmonary disorder associated with aging that has limited therapies, reflecting our incomplete understanding. We conducted an observational study linking molecular markers of cell stress response pathways (UPR: BiP, XBP1; apoptosis: cleaved caspase-3; autophagy: LC3β) in lung tissues from IPF patients and correlated the expression of these protein markers to each subject’s lung function measures. We hypothesized that changes in lung tissue expression of apoptosis, autophagy, and UPR markers correlate with lung function deficits in IPF. The cell stress markers BiP, XBP1, LC3β puncta, and cleaved caspase-3 were found to be elevated in IPF lungs compared to non-IPF lungs, and, further, BiP and cleaved caspase-3 co-localized in IPF lungs. Considering lung function independently, we observed that increased XBP1, BiP, and cleaved caspase-3 were each associated with reduced lung function (FEV1, FVC, TLC, RV). However, increased lung tissue expression of LC3β puncta was significantly associated with increased diffusion capacity (DLCO), an indicator of alveolar–capillary membrane function. Similarly, the co-localization of UPR (XBP1, BiP) and autophagy (LC3β puncta) markers was positively correlated with increased lung function (FEV1, FVC, TLC, DLCO). However, the presence of LC3β puncta can indicate either autophagy flux inhibition or activation. While the nature of our observational cross-sectional study design does not allow conclusions regarding causal links between increased expression of these cell stress markers, lung fibrosis, and lung function decline, it does provide some insights that are hypothesis-generating and suggests that within the milieu of active UPR, changes in autophagy flux may play an important role in determining lung function. Further research is necessary to investigate the mechanisms linking UPR and autophagy in IPF and how an imbalance in these cell stress pathways can lead to progressive fibrosis and loss of lung function. We conclude by presenting five testable hypotheses that build on the research presented here. Such an understanding could eventually lead to the development of much-needed therapies for IPF.","Sharma, Pawan; Alizadeh, Javad; Juarez, Maya; Samali, Afshin; Halayko, Andrew J.; Kenyon, Nicholas J.; Ghavami, Saeid; Zeki, Amir A.",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8307368/,52
19724,Effectiveness of experimental and commercial pertussis vaccines in the elimination of Bordetella pertussis isolates with different genetic profiles in murine model,2021-08-02,"BACKGROUND: To examine two different operation timing for treating patients with a total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) who need emergency surgery and to summarize the effects of the two operation strategies. METHODS: A retrospective review of 54 patients with TAPVC who underwent operations within 72 h of presentation between December 2010 and July 2019 at a single institution was conducted. All patients exhibited respiratory or hemodynamic instability that required mechanical ventilation and inotropic support. Forty-four patients received emergency operations between 24 to 72 h due to stabilization of the patient’s condition. Stable hemodynamics were achieved, and a stable internal milieu was maintained before the operation. These patients comprised the Stable group (SG). Rather than being subjected to efforts to obtain stable hemodynamics and maintain a stable internal milieu, ten patients received emergency operations immediately within 24 h of diagnosis or an emergency operation is performed immediately due to uncorrectable acidosis or progressive cardiovascular collapse. These patients comprised the Unstable group (UG). The hospital course, operative data, and outpatient records were reviewed. RESULTS: In SG group, there were 23 exhibited the supracardiac type, 15 exhibited the cardiac type, 4 exhibited the cardiac type, and 2 exhibited the mixed cardiac type,3 patients were premature, the rest was term infant, PDA was the most common comorbidities (28 patients), the next is severe tricuspid valve regurgitation (21 patients). In UG group, there were 3 exhibited the supracardiac type, 4 exhibited the cardiac type, 3 exhibited the cardiac type, and no patient exhibited the mixed cardiac type, only 1 patient was premature, the rest were term infant. PDA (6 patients) and severe tricuspid valve regurgitation (5 patients) were the top two comorbidities. The median weight, median age at surgery, mean cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) duration and mean aortic cross-clamp (ACC) duration were not significantly different between the two groups. The median postoperation durations of ventilator support were 8.1 ± 4.6 (2–13) days in the SG group and 4.9 ± 2.1 (2–18) days in the UG group, resulting in a significant difference (p = 0.008), the Post-op days in ICU and Days of hospitalization were 8.64 ± 4.04 days and 19.9 ± 4.27 days in the SG group and 5.6 ± 2.01 days and 14.7 ± 1.75 days in the UG group (P = 0.026 and 0.002). There were 12 hospital mortalities (27.3%) in the SG group and 2 hospital mortalities (20%) in the UG group, resulting in no significant difference in mortality (p = 0.636). Postoperative complications, such as low cardiac output and arrhythmia, were not significantly different between the two groups. The survival rates in the UG and SG groups at 5 years were 87.5 and 89.9%, respectively. There was no difference in survival between the two groups at the latest follow-up (SG group 89.9% versus UG group 87.5%, p = 0.8115). CONCLUSION: An emergency operation should be performed immediately without any delay, it can reduce duration of mechanical ventilation and Days of hospitalization without reducing mortality.","Xi, Linyun; Wu, Chun; Pan, Zhengxia; Xiang, Ming",J Cardiothorac Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8328139/,52

However, much less is known about the cases in which the mental disorders act as the only manifestation. METHOD: Total ten patients of RESLES were obtained in this retrospective study from Shenzhen Kangning Hospital. T1-fluid attenuated inversion recovery (T1-FLAIR), T2-weighted images, T2-FLAIR, diffusion-weighted images and apparent diffusion coefficient map were performed on all the patients. Clinical manifestations, laboratory examination results, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, treatments and outcomes were analyzed. RESULT: All patients showed different mental disorders as the only manifestation. There were two cases of alcohol abuse, one of Asperger’s syndrome with malnutrition, one of infection and one of invasive pituitary adenoma. The other cases were diagnosis as major depressive disorder, dissociative and conversion disorders, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, unspecified psychosis and bipolar disorder, respectively. Three patients were completely recovered while the clinical symptoms of rest seven patients partially recovered at the follow-up three months later. Oval-shaped lesion centered on the splenial of corpus callosum (SCC) was observed in all patients using MRI. The lesions of SCC of all patients were completely resolved within five weeks. CONCLUSIONS: We found that RESLES might only showed mental symptoms. On the one hand, for the patients with acute mental disorders, clinicians should be alert to the possibility of RESLES caused by physical disease. On the other hand, we suggest that mental disorder might be a precipitating factor of RESLES.","Xu, Ziyun; Zhou, Zhaoguang; Jang, Wentao; Tian, Jianhong; Hou, Gangqiang",BMC Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8442370/,52
21318,Reversal of brain aging by targeting telomerase: A nutraceutical approach,2021-09-10,"BACKGROUND: The large treatment gap for mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) necessitates task-sharing approaches in scaling up care for mental disorders. Previous work have shown that primary health care workers (PHCW) can be trained to recognize and respond to common mental disorders but there are lingering questions around sustainable implementation and scale-up in real world settings. METHOD: This project is a hybrid implementation-effectiveness study guided by the Replicating Effective Programmes Framework. It will be conducted in four overlapping phases in maternal care clinics (MCC) in 11 local government areas in and around Ibadan metropolis, Nigeria. In Phase I, engagement meetings with relevant stake holders will be held. In phase II, the organizational and clinical profiles of MCC to deliver chronic depression care will be assessed, using interviews and a standardized assessment tool administered to staff and managers of the clinics. To ascertain the current level of care, 167 consecutive women presenting for antenatal care for the first time and who screened positive for depression will be recruited and followed up till 12 months post-partum. In phase III, we will design and implement a cascade training programme for PHCW, to equip them to identify and treat perinatal depression. In phase IV, a second cohort of 334 antenatal women will be recruited and followed up as in Phase I, to ascertain post-training level of care. The primary implementation outcome is change in the identification and treatment of perinatal depression by the PHCW while the primary effectiveness outcome is recovery from depression among the women at 6 months post-partum. A range of mixed-method approaches will be used to explore secondary implementation outcomes, including fidelity and acceptability. Secondary effectiveness outcomes are measures of disability and of infant outcomes. DISCUSSION: This study represents an attempt to systematically assess and document an implementation strategy that could inform the scaling up of evidence based interventions for perinatal depression using the WHO mhGAP-IG in LMIC.

A total of 3198 unrelated Russian subjects including 1572 T2D patients and 1626 healthy subjects were enrolled. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the GSS and GGT7 genes were genotyped using the MassArray-4 system. We found that the GSS and GGT7 gene polymorphisms alone and in combinations are associated with T2D risk regardless of sex, age, and body mass index, as well as correlated with plasma glutathione, hydrogen peroxide, and fasting blood glucose levels. Polymorphisms of GSS (rs13041792) and GGT7 (rs6119534 and rs11546155) genes were associated with the tissue-specific expression of genes involved in unfolded protein response and the regulation of proteostasis. Transcriptome-wide association analysis has shown that the pancreatic expression of some of these genes such as EDEM2, MYH7B, MAP1LC3A, and CPNE1 is linked to the genetic risk of T2D. A comprehensive analysis of the data allowed proposing a new hypothesis for the etiology of type 2 diabetes that endogenous glutathione deficiency might be a key condition responsible for the impaired folding of proinsulin which triggered an unfolded protein response, ultimately leading to beta-cell apoptosis and disease development.","Azarova, Iuliia; Klyosova, Elena; Polonikov, Alexey",Life (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8466482/,52

The efficacy of most clinical chemotherapies is often limited by poor pharmacokinetics and the development of drug resistance by tumors. In a continuing effort to explore small molecules as alternative therapies, we herein evaluated the therapeutic potential of HH-N25, a novel nitrogen-substituted anthra[1,2-c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-6,11-dione derivative. METHODS: We evaluated the in vivo pharmacokinetic properties and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of HH-N25 in rats. We also characterized the compound for in vitro and in vivo anticancer activities and its inhibitory effects against DNA topoisomerases and hormonal signaling in breast cancer. Furthermore, we used molecular docking to analyse the ligand–receptor interactions between the compound and the targets. RESULTS: The maximum serum concentration (C(max)), half-life (t(1/2) beta), mean residence time (MRT), oral clearance (CL/f), and apparent volume of distribution (VD/f) of HH-N25 were 1446.67 ± 312.05 ng/mL, 4.51 ± 0.27 h, 2.56 ± 0.16 h, 8.32 ± 1.45 mL/kg/h, and 1.26 ± 0.15 mL/kg, respectively, after single-dose iv administration at 3 mg/kg body weight. HH-N25 had potent anticancer activity against a panel of human breast cancer cell lines with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) ranging 0.045±0.01~4.21±0.05 µM. The drug also demonstrated marked in vivo anticancer activity at a tolerated dose and prolonged the survival duration of mice without unacceptable toxicities based on body weight changes in human tumor xenograft models. In addition, HH-N25 exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of topoisomerase I and ligand-mediated activities of progesterone and androgen receptors. CONCLUSION: HH-N25 represents a new molecular entity that selective suppressed TOP1 and hormonal signaling, and shows potent antitumor activities in human breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. HH-N25 thus represents a promising anticancer agent that warrants further preclinical and clinical exploration.","Lawal, Bashir; Kuo, Yu-Cheng; Sumitra, Maryam Rachmawati; Wu, Alexander T H; Huang, Hsu-Shan",J Inflamm Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8473721/,52

Localization of sarcoidosis to the CNS is termed neurosarcoidosis, a complex and rare neuroinflammatory form of sarcoidosis. When the spinal cord is involved, lesions are often intradural. Here, we present a rare case of progressive myelopathy secondary to multifocal spinal extradural neurosarcoidosis with spinal cord compression and without pulmonary involvement. CASE PRESENTATION: A 29-year-old African American female presented to the emergency department with numbness and paresthesia of 2-month duration in her left lower extremity and 2-week duration in her right lower extremity. The patient reported difficulty ambulating, paresthesia below the umbilicus, and back pain radiating to bilateral lower extremities. She endorsed 9-month history of cough, subjective fevers, night sweats, and unintentional 15 kg weight loss. Examination revealed 4/5 strength in the left lower extremity. MRI of the brain and spinal cord revealed enhancing extradural lesions, with spinal cord compression at T8 measuring 1.3 × 1.9 cm. Lumbar puncture demonstrated oligoclonal bands and increased CSF neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and protein. T8 laminectomy with resection of the epidural lesion was performed. Histology showed granulomas, consistent with neurosarcoidosis. At follow-up, repeat spinal MRI revealed disease progression with intramedullary involvement. Long-term immunosuppressive treatment was eventually initiated with satisfactory response. DISCUSSION: This is a rare case of myelopathy secondary to spinal extradural neurosarcoidosis. Spinal neurosarcoidosis is predominantly an intradural process. Our review of the literature identified only seven cases of extradural neurosarcoidosis presenting with compressive myelopathy. Additional insight into management and rehabilitation following pathological diagnosis is of clinical significance.","Shields, Ryan; Sagan, Olivia; Roebke, Logan; Vander Maten, Josh; Shah, Shailen; Chang, George; Ibrahim, Dalia; Naz, Sumayya",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8477626/,52

For children with high pain severity, intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment (IIPT) is a well-established treatment. However, across specialized centers, it is not sufficient for all patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a psychosocial aftercare (PAC) program for pediatric patients with severe chronic pain followed up for 6 months after discharge from IIPT. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter randomized clinical trial with 4 assessment points (pre-IIPT, immediately post-IIPT, 3 months, and 6 months) was conducted at 3 pediatric specialized tertiary care pain centers in Germany between September 11, 2018, and March 31, 2020. Included patients were aged 8 to 17 with a severe chronic pain condition who had been admitted for IIPT. Data were analyzed from June 8 to September 4, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Patients and their families were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 study groups at inpatient IIPT admission. Both groups received standardized 3- to 4-week IIPT. After IIPT discharge, the intervention group received PAC and the control group received usual care. PAC involved ongoing contact with a social worker for as long as the family requested the support, up to a maximum of 6 months. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was pain at 6 months, measured using the Chronic Pain Grading (CPG), an instrument based on an algorithm indicating severity of the chronic pain disorder. Secondary outcomes included other pain-related and emotional parameters. RESULTS: A total of 419 patients were randomized (mean [SD] age, 14.3 [2.1] years; 303 [72.3%] girls; 116 [27.7%] boys), with 218 assigned to usual care and 201 assigned to PAC. At baseline in both groups, the median (IQR) CPG was 3 (2-4). Superiority of PAC compared with usual care was demonstrated at 6 months (median [IQR] CPG: usual care, 2 [2-3]; PAC, 1 [1-2]; r = 0.30; 95% CI, 0.17-0.41). Additionally, PAC significantly improved emotional parameters (eg, significant time × group interaction: b = −8.84; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This randomized clinical trial found that PAC improved pain-related and emotional parameters during the intervention 6 months after discharge from IIPT. Future research is needed to investigate the intervention’s long-term effects.

22282,Methods To Identify Aptamers against Cell Surface Biomarkers,2011-09-19,"BACKGROUND: Hendra virus (HeV) has caused lethal disease outbreaks in humans and horses in Australia. Flying foxes are the wildlife reservoir from which the virus was first isolated in 1996. Following a heat stress mortality event in Australian flying foxes in 2013, a novel HeV variant was discovered. This study describes the subsequent surveillance of Australian flying foxes for this novel virus over a nine year period using qRT-PCR testing of tissues from flying foxes submitted primarily for Australian bat lyssavirus diagnosis. Genome sequencing and characterisation of the novel HeV variant was also undertaken. METHODS: Spleen and kidney samples harvested from flying fox carcasses were initially screened with two real-time qRT-PCR assays specific for the prototype HeV. Two additional qRT-PCR assays were developed specific for the HeV variant first detected in samples from a flying fox in 2013. Next-generation sequencing and virus isolation was attempted from selected samples to further characterise the new virus. RESULTS: Since 2013, 98 flying foxes were tested and 11 were positive for the new HeV variant. No samples were positive for the original HeV. Ten of the positive samples were from grey-headed flying foxes (GHFF, Pteropus poliocephalus), however this species was over-represented in the opportunistic sampling (83% of bats tested were GHFF). The positive GHFF samples were collected from Victoria and South Australia and one positive Little red flying fox (LRFF, Pteropus scapulatus) was collected from Western Australia. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of henipavirus antigen, associated with an inflammatory lesion in cardiac blood vessels of one GHFF. Positive samples were sequenced and the complete genome was obtained from three samples. When compared to published HeV genomes, there was 84% sequence identity at the nucleotide level. Based on phylogenetic analyses, the newly detected HeV belongs to the HeV species but occupies a distinct lineage. We have therefore designated this virus HeV genotype 2 (HeV-g2). Attempts to isolate virus from PCR positive samples have not been successful. CONCLUSIONS: A novel HeV genotype (HeV-g2) has been identified in two flying fox species submitted from three states in Australia, indicating that the level of genetic diversity for HeV is broader than first recognised. Given its high genetic relatedness to HeV, HeV-g2 is a zoonotic pathogen.

22545,News from the Internet,2005,"BACKGROUND: Device-associated healthcare-associated infection (DA-HAI) is an important issue related to safety of patients. It is important to reduce unnecessary device utilization in order to decrease DA-HAI rates. Therefore, we investigate to the time trend of device utilization (DU) ratios and DA-HAI rates to analyzed collected data for 10 years through the Korean National Healthcare-associated Infections Surveillance System (KONIS) which is voluntarily participating in hospitals. METHODS: We investigate the time trend of DU ratios and DA-HAI rates from 2006 through 2015 in KONIS participating intensive care units (ICUs). DA-HAI rates were calculated as the numbers of infections per 1,000 device-days and DU were calculated as a ratio of device-days to patient-days. The pooled incidences of DAIs and DU ratios were calculated for each year of participation. RESULTS: Data were collected on 5,325,176 catheter-days and 6,358,829 patient-days in the 190 participating ICUs between July 2006 and June 2016. From 2006 to 2015, year-wise ventilator utilization ratio (V-UR) per 1000 patients-days increased significantly from 0.40 to 0.454 (F = 6.27, P < 0.0001), year-wise urinary catheter utilization ratio (UC-UR) show gradually increased trend from 0.83 to 0.84 but non-significantly (F = 1.66, P = 0.0951), and year-wise c-line utilization ratio (CL-UR) was gradually decreased non-significantly from 0.55 to 0.52 (F = 1.62, P = 0.1059). In subgroup analysis, Medical ICU (F = 2.79, P = 0.0034) or hospital with more than 900 beds (F = 3.07, P = 0.0015) related to increased significantly V-UR. Rate of ventilator associated pneumonia significantly decreased from 3.48 in 2006 to 1.00 in 2015 (per 1000 ventilator-days, F = 27.62, P < 0.0001). Also, rates of catheter associated UTI and c-line associated blood stream infection significantly decreased from 1.85 to 0.88 (per 1000 catheter-days, F = 10.14, P < 0.0001) and from 3.40 to 2.20 (per 1000 catheter-days, F = 14.17, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: In Korea, all of the DA-HAIs have shown a significant reduction in the last 10 years, however V-UR has year-wise significantly increased trend for past 10-years, also UC-UR and CL-UR have not decreased trend significantly. We need effort to make reduction of device utilization ratios. DISCLOSURES: E. J. Kim, Korean Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System (KONIS): Investigator, Research support; Y. HOURS.

22621,Ecology of Infectious Disease: Forging an Alliance,2006-08-15,"Bats are the natural reservoir of Coronaviruses (CoVs). Human CoVs cause mild respiratory diseases worldwide, but, in the last decade, two Beta-CoVs [Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome] caused thousands of deaths and cases worldwide. Phylogenetic analysis suggested the evolutionary origin of mammalian CoVs is derived from bats. In this study, we characterized three Alpha-CoVs and two Beta-CoVs demonstrating the circulation of bat strains in Italy. Isolates were sequenced using a next-generation sequencing approach and genomes reconstructed using the online tool Galaxy Aries. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using MEGA7 and MrBayes. Similarity plots were generated using SSE v1.2. The structure of the receptor binding domain (RBD) in the S protein was predicted by sequence-homology method using the protein data bank. Bioinformatics analysis permitted the identification of 2 Beta-CoV complete genomes of 30 kb and three Alpha-CoV of 28 kb (named BatCoV-ITA1-5). BatCoV-ITA1 and 2 formed a monophyletic group with MERS-CoV sequences. The comparison of the concatenated domains within ORF1ab confirmed their classification into the MERS-CoV species. The 3D structure of RBD of Italian strains showed two amino acid deletions located in a region corresponding to the external subdomain of MERS-RBD. BatCoV-Ita3 and BatCoV-Ita4/5 were classified into two novel Alpha-CoV species by comparison of concatenated domains within ORF1ab. Due to the high divergence with the Alpha human spike protein strains, it was impossible to establish the protein structure and the potential affinity to human receptor. The Italian strains showed the typical organization of Alpha and Beta-CoVs. We reported two Beta-CoVs closely related to MERS-CoVs from bats belonging to common Italian species (Pipistrellus kuhlii and Hypsugo savii). The analysis of the RBD in the spike protein indicates significant differences from human RBD known to date. The three Alpha-CoV strains were classified into two novel species, confirming the high heterogeneity of CoV strains in bats. Although the studies conducted cannot confirm a risk for humans, surveillance studies are needed to investigate the genetic diversity of CoVs in bats. Because this exceeds what is known for other hosts, it is compatible with bats being the major reservoir of mammalian CoVs.","De Sabato, L; Vaccari, G; Lelli, D; Lavazza, A; Castrucci, M R; Moreno, A",Virus Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6735706/,52

Developing new drugs from scratch is a lengthy process, thus impractical to face the immediate global challenge. Drug repurposing is an emerging strategy where existing medicines, having already been tested safe in humans, are redeployed to combat difficult-to-treat diseases. While using such repurposed drugs individually may ultimately not yield a significant clinical benefit, carefully combined cocktails could be very effective, as was for HIV in the 1990s; the urgent question now being which combination.","Senanayake, Suranga L",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117595/,52
23859,Interpretation and Relevance of Advanced Technique Results,2018-11-10,MicroRNAs (miRNAs) encoded by viral genome or host have been found participating in host-microbe interactions. Differential expression profiles of miRNAs were shown linking to specific disease pathologies which indicated its potency as diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers of infectious disease. This was emphasized by the discovery of circulating miRNAs which were found to be remarkably stable in mammalian biofluids. Standardized methods of miRNA quantification including RNA isolation should be established before they will be ready for use in clinical practice.,"Cui, Lunbiao; Markou, Athina; Stratton, Charles W.; Lianidou, Evi",Advanced Techniques in Diagnostic Microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119978/,52

The chapter shows how their poor state of Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) can be the outcome of a combination of forms of institutional discrimination that are interconnected and should be investigated in respect of: (a) the worth of their ‘identity’ (migrant, female, the work they do); (b) the distinct aspects of discourse on sexuality and normativity which specifically relate to their presence in the destination countries; and (c) ideational and material realities constraining their own agency in finding adequate care. The chapter shows how variations in the potential for access may be explained by the types and degree of their structural vulnerability regarding labour rights, their relationship with employers and migrants’ associations, and their personal SRH awareness–together with what emerges from cooperation between those government officials and civil society organizations who work with migrant domestic workers. Attentiveness to the particular combination of forms of institutional discrimination in a given cultural and institutional context, especially the ways in which the Sexual and Reproductive Health of Filipina domestic workers are linked to the ways in which labour migration are organized, should be helpful for effective SRH advocacy.","Truong, Thanh-Dam; Quesada-Bondad, Amara","Migration, Gender and Social Justice",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120451/,52

Fundamentally the simulator loosely simulates SIR (Susceptible Infected Removed) and SEIR (Susceptible Exposed Infected Removed). The Geo-spatial model with global interaction and our approach of global stochastic cellular automata are also discussed. The global stochastic cellular automata takes into account the demography, culture of a region. The simulator can be used to study the dynamics of disease epidemics over large geographic regions.

Aretaeus of Cappadocia, a well-known Greek physician (second century A.D.), is credited with providing the first detailed description of an asthma attack [13], and to Celsus it was a disease with wheezing and noisy, violent breathing. In the history of Rome, we find many members of the Julio-Claudian family affected with probable atopic respiratory disorders: Caesar Augustus suffered from bronchoconstriction, seasonal rhinitis as well as a highly pruritic skin disease. Claudius suffered from rhinoconjunctivitis and Britannicus was allergic to horse dander [529].

Over the past two decades, biotechnological interventions, especially Bt proteins, have been successfully implemented across the world and have had major impacts on reducing chemical pesticide applications. As insects continue to adapt to insecticides, both chemical and protein-based, new methods, molecules, and modes of action are necessary to provide sustainable solutions. RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as a significant tool to knock down or alter gene expression profiles in a species-specific manner. In the past decade, there has been intense research on RNAi applications in crop protection. This chapter looks at the current state of knowledge in the field and outlines the methodology, delivery methods, and precautions required in designing targets. Assessing the targeting of specific gene expression is also an important part of a successful RNAi strategy. The current literature on the use of RNAi in major orders of insect pests is reviewed, along with a perspective on the regulatory aspects of the approach. Risk assessment of RNAi would focus on molecular characterization, food/feed risk assessment, and environmental risk assessment. As more RNAi-based products come through regulatory systems, either via direct application or plant expression based, the impact of this approach on crop protection will become clearer.","Alamalakala, Leela; Parimi, Srinivas; Patel, Navid; Char, Bharat",Trends in Insect Molecular Biology and Biotechnology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121382/,52

25085,Nanoformulations: A Valuable Tool in the Therapy of Viral Diseases Attacking Humans and Animals,2019-11-23,"Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and three-dimensional (3D) image processing have gained importance in the last few years to obtain atomic structures of drug targets. Obtaining atomic-resolution 3D structure better than ~2.5 Å is a standard approach in pharma companies to design and optimize therapeutic compounds against drug targets like proteins. Protein crystallography is the main technique in solving the structures of drug targets at atomic resolution. However, this technique requires protein crystals which in turn is a major bottleneck. It was not possible to obtain the structure of proteins better than 2.5 Å resolution by any other methods apart from protein crystallography until 2015. Recent advances in single-particle cryo-EM and 3D image processing have led to a resolution revolution in the field of structural biology that has led to high-resolution protein structures, thus breaking the cryo-EM resolution barriers to facilitate drug discovery. There are 24 structures solved by single-particle cryo-EM with resolution 2.5 Å or better in the EMDataBank (EMDB) till date. Among these, five cryo-EM 3D reconstructions of proteins in the EMDB have their associated coordinates deposited in Protein Data Bank (PDB), with bound inhibitor/ ligand. Thus, for the first time, single-particle cryo-EM was included in the structure-based drug design (SBDD) pipeline for solving protein structures independently or where crystallography has failed to crystallize the protein. Further, this technique can be complementary and supplementary to protein crystallography field in solving 3D structures. Thus, single-particle cryo-EM can become a standard approach in pharmaceutical industry in the design, validation, and optimization of therapeutic compounds targeting therapeutically important protein molecules during preclinical drug discovery research. The present chapter will describe briefly the history and the principles of single-particle cryo-EM and 3D image processing to obtain atomic-resolution structure of proteins and their complex with their drug targets/ligands.","Natesh, Ramanathan",Structural Bioinformatics: Applications in Preclinical Drug Discovery Process,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121590/,52

25537,Tissue Culture Models,2009-03-25,"An immunologic component to schizophrenia and depression has been increasingly recognized, which has led to extensive research into the associations with infections and autoimmune diseases. Large-scale nationwide epidemiological studies have displayed an increased prevalence of both autoimmune diseases and infections among persons with schizophrenia and depression. Autoimmune diseases, and especially the number of infections requiring hospitalization, increase the risk of schizophrenia and depression in a dose–response relationship. Infections are a common exposure and a broad spectrum of infections are associated with schizophrenia and depression. Particularly the autoimmune diseases with a potential presence of brain-reactive antibodies were associated with psychiatric disorders. However, the associations seem to be bidirectional, since the risk of autoimmune diseases and infections is also increased after diagnosis with schizophrenia and depression. The risk of autoimmune diseases was particularly increased in individuals with prior hospital contacts for infections. It has been suggested that inflammation and autoimmunity could be involved in the etiology and pathogenesis of some patients with symptoms of schizophrenia and depression. The psychiatric symptoms can be directly triggered by immune components, such as brain-reactive antibodies and cytokines, or infections reaching the central nervous system (CNS), or be secondary to systemic inflammation indirectly affecting the brain. However, the associations could also be caused by shared genetic factors, other environmental factors, or common etiological components. Nonetheless, autoimmune diseases and infections should be considered by clinicians in the treatment of individuals with psychiatric symptoms, since treatment would probably improve the psychiatric symptoms, quality of life, and the survival of the individuals.","Benrós, Michael Eriksen; Mortensen, Preben B.",Immunology and Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122152/,52

In end-stage renal disease, kidney transplantation provides benefits compared with dialysis in terms of improved patient survival better quality of life, and lower ongoing costs after the first year. Living donor kidney transplantation has an advantage with improved allograft survival, and performed earlier and electively compared with deceased donor transplantation. However sensitized patients are increasing in number on transplant waiting lists, and their prospect of getting a transplant is less than nonsensitized patients due to immunological incompatibility with the donor. Strategy for sensitized patients are listing for a compatible deceased donor transplant or, if they have a living donor, either selecting a kidney exchange program or undergoing a desensitization procedure. Desensitization procedures may be undertaken to increase access to either living or deceased donor transplants, and in some situations may also be employed to facilitate participation in a kidney exchange, in less immunological barrier to be overcome. The question of whether individuals are better off with a desensitization treatment followed by HLA-incompatible living donor transplantation or waiting on the deceased donor kidney transplant list for a compatible transplant has recently been addressed by two large multicenter studies, with conflicting results. A multicenter study from the United States published in the New England Journal of Medicine [365;318 326.2011] concluded that there was a strong survival benefit for sensitized patients undergoing desensitization followed by HLA-incompatible living donor kidney transplant compared with those remaining on the waiting list. Of interest, a second study, published in the Lancet, [389;727 734.2017] found no significant survival advantage for desensitized patients compared with similar patients remaining on the waiting list in the United Kingdom. Controversies still remain regarding how desensitization can be achieved and which techniques are effective and safe.

Connections between the domains of resilience and risk assessment include vulnerability. Infrastructure, social, economic, and ecological systems (and combined social-ecological systems) are vulnerable to exogenous global change, and other disturbances, both natural and anthropologically derived. Resilience analysis fundamentally seeks to provide the groundwork for a ‘soft landing’, or an efficient and robust restoration following disturbance as well as the ability to reduce harms while helping the targeted system rebound to full functionality as quickly and efficiently where possible. Such applications are consistent with The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) definition of resilience, which more broadly denotes the field as “the ability to plan and prepare for, absorb, recover from, and adapt to adverse events” (Larkin S, Fox-Lent C, Eisenberg DA, Trump BD, Wallace S, Chadderton C, Linkov I (2015) Benchmarking agency and organizational practices in resilience decision making.

Ribosomes, initiation factors, elongation factors, amino acids, tRNAs, and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are the major components of the protein synthetic apparatus. Protein synthesis proceeds in three steps—initiation, elongation, and termination, followed by posttranslational modifications. The rate-limiting factors for the regulation of total protein synthesis can be any of the components of the protein synthetic machinery. The availability of mRNA and the amounts and activities of ribosomes, initiation factors, and elongation factors are the major regulators of protein synthesis.

These tests are often performed by non-laboratory trained staff. At the present time there are no external quality assessment (EQA) providers in the UK offering proficiency testing schemes for HIV point of care testing. The aim of this study is to develop such an EQA scheme. Firstly, a selection of the most widely used POCTs was selected and their performance assessed using existing HIV-positive serology EQA specimens. All assays produced the correct results however intensity of results observed for the same specimen differed greatly between POCT devices. In addition the effect of various sub-groups of HIV-1 serum samples on the HIV POCT assays was investigated and no difference between the results on the POCTs was observed. Ultimately four serum specimens, two HIV-1 and one HIV-2 positive, one HIV negative, were chosen and sent to NHS laboratories and sexual health clinics for testing as part of a pilot EQA scheme for HIV POCT. Results were excellent with 97% of participants reporting correct results (n= 20). The study highlighted a lack of awareness of EQA particularly in non-laboratory settings, although recommendations (ISO 22870:2006) are in place for the users of such devices. In conclusion, the need for EQA for providers of point of care testing is an integral part of ensuring reliability of results and quality of care for the patient.","Abdul-Khaliq, Catherine",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149475/,52

Viruses use all known mechanisms of variation; mutation, several forms of recombination, and segment reassortment in the case of viruses with a segmented genome. These processes are intimately connected with the replicative machineries of viruses, as well as with fundamental physical-chemical properties of nucleotides when acting as template or substrate residues. Recombination has been viewed as a means to rescue viable genomes from unfit parents or to produce large modifications for the exploration of phenotypic novelty. All types of genetic variation can act conjointly as blind processes to provide the raw materials for adaptation to the changing environments in which viruses must replicate. A distinction is made between mechanistically unavoidable and evolutionarily relevant mutation and recombination.","Domingo, Esteban",Virus as Populations,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153327/,52

The discovery of short, membrane interacting, amphipathic or hydrophobic sequences (known as membranotropic peptides) in both enveloped and non‐enveloped viruses suggests that these small peptides are strongly involved in breaching the host membrane and in the delivery of the viral genome into the host cell. Thus, in spite of noticeable differences in entry, this short stretches of membranotropic peptides are probably associated with similar entry‐related events. This review will uncover the intrinsic features of viral membranotropic peptides involved in viral entry of both naked viruses and the ones encircled with a biological membrane with the objective to better elucidate their different functional properties and possible applications in the biomedical field.","Falanga, Annarita; Galdiero, Massimiliano; Morelli, Giancarlo; Galdiero, Stefania",Pept Sci (Hoboken),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167733/,52

There is a paucity of in‐depth qualitative research into the general public's understanding of, and reactions to, such potential health crises. Four focus groups were conducted in April 2006 and a further eight focus groups in July 2006, to examine people's knowledge, beliefs and behaviours in relation to avian influenza, with the primary aim being to inform the development of future communication strategies. It was clear from the focus groups that avian influenza is not a disease the participants perceive they are likely to acquire; it was not simply that Australia was far from mind when thinking of avian influenza, but that they also saw Australia as a haven protected from avian influenza. We found that, in general, participants see avian influenza as yet another example of media sensationalism—not as a disease that poses any real risk to Australia—and are clearly unprepared for a potential outbreak. Governments and health authorities should conduct further research to understand consumer perceptions of avian (or other pandemic) influenza, and attitudes towards the recommended protective behaviours, in order to pro‐actively develop communication strategies to rapidly inform the public and encourage appropriate behavioural responses in the event that the potential risk is realised.

We investigated antitumour immune responses in sentinel nodes from patients with bladder cancer, by assaying tumour‐specific proliferation and TCR Vβ repertoires. During tumour surgery, sentinel lymph nodes were identified by peri‐tumoural injection of blue dye. Fresh specimens of tumour, sentinel and nonsentinel lymph nodes were obtained, and single‐cell suspensions were prepared. Cells were assayed for reactivity against autologous tumour extract in [(3)H]‐thymidine incorporation assays and characterized by flow cytometry. Parallel analyses of the expression of Vβ gene families were performed with padlock probes, linear oligonucleotides which upon target recognition can be converted to circular molecules by a ligase. Probes were reacted with cDNA prepared from magnetically separated CD4(+) cells, and the TCR repertoire was determined by hybridizing the products to oligonucleotide microarrays. Dose‐dependent proliferation in response to tumour extract could be detected in sentinel lymph nodes. Common clonal expansions were detected among tumour‐infiltrating lymphocytes and in sentinel lymph nodes. Nonsentinel lymph nodes displayed a divergent TCR Vβ repertoire. These results indicate an ongoing immune response against tumour antigens in sentinel nodes, draining urinary bladder cancer. Identification of sentinel lymph nodes makes it possible to obtain tumour‐reactive lymphocytes for use in adoptive immunotherapy.","Karlsson, M.; Marits, P.; Banèr, J.; Sherif, A.; Thörn, M.; Landegren, U.; Winqvist, O.",Scand J Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169505/,52

This study aims to retrospectively determine the clinical and radiographic outcomes after use of the Ilizarov technique for knee joint arthrodesis as a treatment for end-stage knee TB. METHODS: Twenty-six patients with end-stage knee TB treated by external fixation with the Ilizarov fixator between 2012 and 2017 were examined. Anti-TB drugs were administered preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively. Clinical and radiologic examinations were performed for comprehensive evaluations, and these include C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), flexion and valgus angle of the knee, leg-length discrepancy, and Lysholm score. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were followed up for an average of 5.8 years (2.2–7 years). All patients achieved bone fusion within a mean of 6.4 months (4–16 months). The ESR and CRP concentrations were observed to return to normal within 5.1 ± 1.1 months postoperatively. There was no recurrence of TB. At last follow-up, the mean leg-length discrepancy was 2.7 ± 1.4 cm, and the mean alignment was 8.7 ± 2.6° flexion and 5.3 ± 1.0° valgus. No patient had a significant rotational deformity. The average Lysholm score was seen to improve significantly from 36.8 ± 18.4 preoperatively to 79.5 ± 5.9 at final follow-up (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: This study has demonstrated that the Ilizarov technique for knee joint arthrodesis as a treatment of end-stage knee TB achieved promising outcomes with minimal complications.","Sun, Jiachen; Li, Qiang; Gao, Feng; Xiang, Zhou; Huang, Qi; Li, Lang",BMC Musculoskelet Disord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7447600/,52

Since the 1990s, the education sector has been called upon to create more ‘entrepreneurs’ to find solutions to global problems leading to entrepreneurship education. The educator is a key participant in the process of entrepreneurship education, but too little is known or understood about their experiences. Employing an interpretative phenomenological approach with ten UK-based higher education entrepreneurship education educators, this article sheds light on their experiences. The article concludes by proposing a conceptual model of the essence of entrepreneurship education educators’ experiences which identifies shared values, multiple identities and innovative practices. It finds something personal and inherently ‘good’ about entrepreneurship education, beyond the knowledge of entrepreneurship, which attracts certain educators. These educators are found to be entrepreneurial with a need for change, distinctiveness and action which at times can lead to marginalisation from the traditional educational establishment. They are found to be highly efficacious entrepreneurial employees (Lackéus et al., Bacigalupo (ed) The entrepreneurial employee in the public and private sector—what, why, how.

42775,Editorial overview: Vaccines 2020,2020-12-03,"The COVID-19 pandemic is damaging economies across the world, including financial markets and institutions in all possible dimensions. For banks in particular, the pandemic generates multifaceted crises, mostly through increases in default rates. This is likely to be worse in developing economies with poor financial market architecture. This paper utilizes Bangladesh as a case study of an emerging economy and examines the possible impacts of the pandemic on the country’s banking sector. Bangladesh’s banking sector already has a high level of non-performing loans (NPLs) and the pandemic is likely to worsen the situation. Using a state-designed stress testing model, the paper estimates the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on three particular dimensions—firm value, capital adequacy, and interest income—under different NPL shock scenarios. Findings suggest that all banks are likely to see a fall in risk-weighted asset values, capital adequacy ratios, and interest income at the individual bank and sectoral levels. However, estimates show that larger banks are relatively more vulnerable. The decline in all three dimensions will increase disproportionately if NPL shocks become larger. Findings further show that a 10% NPL shock could force capital adequacy of all banks to go below the minimum BASEL-III requirement, while a shock of 13% or more could turn it to zero or negative at the sectoral level. Findings call for immediate and innovative policy measures to prevent a large-scale and contagious banking crisis in Bangladesh. The paper offers lessons for other developing and emerging economies similar to Bangladesh.

Technologies of training young professionals developed in the WorldSkills championship movement have been effectively applied in universities in the last years. This applies to improve the content of educational programs and curricula . WorldSkills movement allows future engineers to improve their professional skills in working professions related to the future profession of engineer. The training base and training ground for students are being improved, direct contacts with different companies and representatives from the government are being formed during competitions. Experts claim that approximately every country in the world will encounter a lack of personnel in key sectors of the economy by 2025. We observe a rapid shift to the digital economy and see how new competencies are emerging and existing ones are developing. In 2020 the situation with coronavirus confirms the relevance of a rapid shift to the digital economy and improvement of existing competencies. Therefore, WorldSkills movement plays an important role in these processes. The consequences of existing trends in the development of the global economy are job cuts, the appearance of new people, and retraining staff to the digital economy and destruction of the usual mechanisms «guarantees of the future» (career guidance, long-term employment, and decent pension). These statements were cleared up with the support of Young professionals [1]. On the other hand, there is a declining interest in engineering professions all over the world. Nowadays only a small percentage of young people choose technical specialties and engineering education. Therefore, one of the most important problems is the awakening of young people's interest in engineering specialties from school days and while studying in colleges [2] . All over the world technological and engineering universities try to persuade young learners and students to study technical studies and engineering professions as a possible future career. That is why it is important to make new informal and other methods of developing an interest in engineering professions [3, 4]. International Young professionals WorldSkills movement has a crucial role in the process of training and teaching youngsters to adapt to new realias. And also provide engineering universities with effective methods and technologies for attracting talented young people to engineering professions and training of future engineers.","Alla, A.

Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2 concentrations in solids normalized by concentrations of PMMoV RNA in solids can be used to compare incidence of laboratory confirmed new COVID-19 cases across POTWs. Using data collected at seven POTWs along the United States West Coast, Midwest, and East Coast serving ∼3% of the U.S. population (9 million people), we show that a 1 log change in N gene/PMMoV is associated with a 0.24 (range 0.19 to 0.29) log(10) change in incidence of laboratory confirmed COVID-19. Scaling of N1 and N2 by PMMoV is consistent, conceptually, with a mass balance model relating SARS-CoV-2 RNA to the number of infected individuals shedding virus in their stool.

A retrospective study was conducted on 600 patients who presented with symptoms suspicious for COVID-19 infection between March and the end of June 2020. The current study followed the RSNA recommendations in CT reporting and correlated with the RT-PCR. CT was reviewed and the severity score was correlated with the patient’s management. RESULTS: Four hundred sixty-six patients were included with a mean age of 46 + 14.8 years and 63.3 % were males. Three hundred forty patients were confirmed positive by RT-PCR. CT sensitivity was 92.6% while the RT-PCR was the reference. The CT specificity showed a gradual increase with the CT probability reaching 97.6% with high probability CT features. Ground-glass opacities (GGO) was the commonest findings 85.9% with a high incidence of bilateral, peripheral, and multilobar involvement (88%, 92.8%, and 92.8% respectively). Consolidation was found in 81.5% of the ICU patients and was the dominant feature in 66.7% of the ICU cases. CT severity score was significantly higher in ICU patients with a score of ≥ 14. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 infection showed typical CT features which can be used as a rapid and sensitive investigation. Two CT phenotypes identified with the predominant consolidation phenotype as well as severity score can be used to determine infection severity and ICU need.","Osman, Ahmed M.; Abdrabou, Ahmed M.; Hashim, Reham M.; Khosa, Faisal; Yasin, Aya",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8150151/,52
53833,"Novel Phenolic Compounds as Potential Dual EGFR and COX-2 Inhibitors: Design, Semisynthesis, in vitro Biological Evaluation and in silico Insights",2021-05-31,"Background: The aim of the presented series of studies was to test the factor structure and assess the psychometric properties of the Resilience Scale 25 in the Polish population. It was developed and tested during the course of four independent studies analysing various aspects of the validation of the RS 25 questionnaire’s Polish version. Method: Study 1 concerned the procedure for developing the Polish language version. Study 2 (N = 2716) consisted of reliability tests and a confirmatory factor analysis. In Studies 3 (N = 733) and 4 (N = 431), the validity was assessed by examining the relationship between resilience and the assessment of ego-resiliency, the risk of depression, styles of coping with stress, perceived stress, and satisfaction with life. Results: The presented research results obtained using the measure indicate that it can be considered to be a reliable and valid research tool. A five-factor solution showed a good fit to the data: χ(2)/df = 12.85; RMSEA = 0.066 (low = 0.064; high = 0.068; 90% CI); GFI = 0.90; AGFI = 0.90. An assessment of the internal consistency was carried out on the basis of Cronbach’s alpha. The values achieved were satisfactory and indicate acceptable internal reliability of the questionnaire (0.89) and of the five dimensions: (1) purpose (0.65); (2) equanimity (0.65); (3) self-reliance (0.75); (4) perseverance (0.72); and (5) existential aloneness (0.66). In accordance with the predictions and earlier studies, resilience was correlated positively with ego-resiliency, a task-oriented style of coping with stress, and life satisfaction and negatively with perceived stress, the risk of depression, and an emotion-oriented coping style. Conclusion: The Polish version of the RS 25 allows the assessment of the intensity of resilience as a general indicator and its five constituting dimensions. Such a measurement seems to be important from the perspective of assessing the role of an individual’s resources in clinical psychology, health psychology, and psychotherapy.","Konaszewski, Karol; Skalski, Sebastian; Surzykiewicz, Janusz",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8161488/,52

Low‐wage workers were hit particularly hard, including restaurant workers. The production and distribution of food being essential and agri‐food supply chains being resilient, other workers in the agri‐food sector were less impacted by public health measures and the pandemic. Employment in grocery stores remained steady and employment of agricultural workers, including temporary foreign workers, proved more robust than expected. Dealing with contaminated workers proved challenging in meat processing plants. Temporary plant shutdowns and slowdowns created livestock queuing problems and temporary increases in meat prices. The federal and provincial governments implemented several programs to mitigate the pandemic's adverse effects on labor markets. The pandemic will have permanent effect on labor markets, but with unemployment rates falling rapidly across Canada, recruiting and retention remain the main labor issues in agriculture.","Larue, Bruno",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8206915/,52
54999,Development of Therapeutic Antibodies and Modulating the Characteristics of Therapeutic Antibodies to Maximize the Therapeutic Efficacy,2021-06-28,"Salient regions provide important cues for scene understanding to the human vision system. However, whether the detected salient regions are helpful in image blur estimation is unknown. In this study, a salient region guided blind image sharpness assessment (BISA) framework is proposed, and the effect of the detected salient regions on the BISA performance is investigated. Specifically, three salient region detection (SRD) methods and ten BISA models are jointly explored, during which the output saliency maps from SRD methods are re-organized as the input of BISA models. Consequently, the change in BISA metric values can be quantified and then directly related to the difference in BISA model inputs. Finally, experiments are conducted on three Gaussian blurring image databases, and the BISA prediction performance is evaluated. The comparison results indicate that salient region input can help achieve a close and sometimes superior performance to a BISA model over the whole image input. When using the center region input as the baseline, the detected salient regions from the saliency optimization from robust background detection (SORBD) method lead to consistently better score prediction, regardless of the BISA model. Based on the proposed hybrid framework, this study reveals that saliency detection benefits image blur estimation, while how to properly incorporate SRD methods and BISA models to improve the score prediction will be explored in our future work.","Liu, Siqi; Yu, Shaode; Zhao, Yanming; Tao, Zhulin; Yu, Hang; Jin, Libiao",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8229120/,52
55559,"Hollow structures as drug carriers: Recognition, response, and release",2021-07-08,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) initiated shocks to the Canadian agri‐food industry moving the sector away from its prepandemic equilibrium. Disequilibrium can mean, postshock, that sectors follow different paths of adjustment. The public and politicians appear to desire that economic activity returns to prepandemic norms—but this is far from assured. In the case of the Canadian agri‐food industry, the postshock path of adjustment appears to be returning to the preshock equilibrium, or near to it. This provides a familiar and stable anchor for those whose lives are otherwise considerably disrupted by the pandemic. The multilateral international trade system has long been in need of reform—reforms that would benefit Canada's agri‐food exporting sector. The pandemic has raised trade issues that require urgent action and some countries see this as an opportunity for reform. Canada has been at the forefront of this activity through the fostering, hosting, and chairing of the Ottawa Group of 13 World Trade Organization members that have been charged with bringing forward proposals for reform that will break the log jam in multilateral negotiations.

56134,Evolution of the Computational Pharmaceutics Approaches in the Modeling and Prediction of Drug Payload in Lipid and Polymeric Nanocarriers,2021-07-05,"BACKGROUND: Despite growing evidence to support the use of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) for managing carious lesions, and the increased interest in SDF worldwide, uptake in the UK remains limited. This study explored parents’ and children’s views and acceptability of SDF for the management of carious lesions in children. METHODS: Eleven semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with 11 parent–child dyads recruited from patients attending Dundee Dental Hospital and School. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, coded and thematically analysed. RESULTS: Previous dental experience varied across all child participants. Of the 11 children, five had undergone general anaesthesia (GA) for multiple primary tooth extractions. Two had received SDF treatment. Child participants expressed concerns about being picked on by their peers, if they had discoloured anterior teeth. Younger children appeared less concerned about the discolouration and child’s gender did not appear to influence parents’ decision-making, nor the child’s preferences regarding the use of SDF. Parents considered SDF to be particularly useful for anxious or uncooperative children but raised concerns about potential bullying at schools due to the unacceptable dental aesthetics when SDF is applied to anterior teeth. They believed they may be judged by others as neglecting their child’s oral health due to the black staining. Both parents and children were more accepting of the SDF when applied to less-visible posterior teeth. Parents accepted the use of SDF if such treatment avoided extractions under GA. CONCLUSION: Despite the unfavourable aesthetics of SDF (black staining), parents appreciated SDF treatment, especially for uncooperative or younger children. However, both parents and children shared concerns about bullying at schools as a consequence of the black staining. Raising awareness about SDF was identified as one approach to encourage the uptake of SDF.

The treatment of these disorders is limited to ameliorating the symptoms and improving the quality of life of patients. In this study, serum samples from RA, AS, and PsA patients were analyzed with metabolomic tools employing the 1H NMR method in combination with univariate and multivariate analyses. The results obtained in this study showed that the changes in metabolites were the highest for AS > RA > PsA. The study demonstrated that the time until remission or until low disease activity is achieved is shortest (approximately three months) for AS, longer for RA and longest for PsA. The statistically common metabolite that was found to be negatively correlated with the healing processes of these disorders is ethanol, which may indicate the involvement of the gut microflora and/or the breakdown of malondialdehyde as a cell membrane lipid peroxide product.","Bogunia-Kubik, Katarzyna; Wojtowicz, Wojciech; Swierkot, Jerzy; Mielko, Karolina Anna; Qasem, Badr; Wielińska, Joanna; Sokolik, Renata; Pruss, Łukasz; Młynarz, Piotr",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8307996/,52

COVID-19 pandemic may undermine the vulnerable well-being of parents in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs). Objective: Our study aimed to explore whether parental stress, depression, and participation in care in an Italian NICU changed significantly over three periods: pre-pandemic (T(0)), low (T(1)), and high COVID-19 incidence (T(2)). Methods: Enrolled parents were assessed with the Parental Stressor Scale in the NICU (PSS:NICU), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and Index of Parental Participation (IPP). Stress was the study primary outcome. A sample of 108 parents, 34 for each time period, was estimated to be adequate to detect a difference in PSS:NICU stress occurrence level score (SOL) of 1.25 points between time periods. To estimate score differences among the three study periods a non-parametric analysis was performed. Correlation among scores was assessed with Spearman rank coefficient. Results: Overall, 152 parents were included in the study (62 in T(0), 56 in T(1), and 34 in T(2)). No significant differences in the median PSS:NICU, EPDS, and IPP scores were observed over the three periods, except for a slight increase in the PSS:NICU parental role sub-score in T(2) (T(0) 3.3 [2.3–4.1] vs. T(2) 3.9 [3.1–4.3]; p = 0.038). In particular, the question regarding the separation from the infant resulted the most stressful aspect during T(2) (T(0) 4.0 [4.0–5.0] vs. T(2) 5.0 [4.0–5.0], p = 0.008). The correlation between participation and stress scores (r = 0.19–022), and between participation and depression scores (r = 0.27) were weak, while among depression and stress, a moderate positive correlation was found (r = 0.45–0.48). Conclusions: This study suggests that parental stress and depression may be contained during the COVID-19 pandemic, while participation may be ensured.","Bua, Jenny; Mariani, Ilaria; Girardelli, Martina; Tomadin, Murphy; Tripani, Antonella; Travan, Laura; Lazzerini, Marzia",Front Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8515023/,52

The aim of this study was to evaluate early experiences of hybrid pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) and to identify the learning curve of robotic surgery. METHODS Sixteen patients underwent hybrid PD from August 2015 to February 2016. The outcomes were compared with those of an open PD group by the same operator during the same period. The resection time and anastomosis time were analyzed. RESULTS Six patients in the hybrid PD group developed complications. The postoperative hospital stay in the hybrid surgery group was significantly shorter than the open PD group (10.9 ± 3.2 vs 16.9 ± 8.8 days). The total operative time of hybrid surgery was significantly longer than that of open surgery (414.7 ± 47.0 vs 266.0 ± 51.1 minutes). In hybrid surgery, the actual operation time reduced with experience, particularly anastomosis time. CONCLUSION Hybrid PD is feasible and safe. The learning curve of hybrid surgery, particularly robotic anastomosis, is relatively short.","Kim, Hongbeom; Kim, Jae Ri; Han, Youngmin; Kwon, Wooil; Kim, Sun-Whe; Jang, Jin-Young",The international journal of medical robotics + computer assisted surgery : MRCAS,https://doi.org/10.1002/rcs.1814; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28276146/,52

The course utilized online asynchronous coursework to deliver content that was completed on a self-guided timeline by students. With most of the veterinary medical curriculum delivered in a traditional classroom format, it is important to assess learning in this unique course format. There is also limited information on educational experiences in online shelter medicine coursework. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate student learning in the asynchronous online portion of the SSOI elective course using paired pre- and post-test scores from a multiple-choice type assessment. The study investigated how students' pre-test and post-test scores compared and whether time to completion of material influenced student assessment performance. Paired assessments from 400 students were analyzed, and a statistically significant increase was found in post-test scores compared to pre-test following completion of the online coursework (p < .001). There was no significant difference in the mean change in score from pre-test to post-test for students who completed the online course material in 30 days or less compared to those who completed it in greater than 30 days.

While studies in homozygous Sox9 knockout mouse models confirmed that SOX9 is critical for testis development, mice heterozygous for the Sox9-null allele were reported to develop normal testes. This led to the belief that the SOX9 dosage requirement for testis differentiation is different between humans, which often require both alleles, and mice, in which one allele is sufficient. However, in prior studies, gonadal phenotypes in heterozygous Sox9 XY mice were assessed only by either gross morphology, histological staining or analyzed on a mixed genetic background. In this study, we conditionally inactivated Sox9 in somatic cells of developing gonads using the Nr5a1-Cre mouse line on a pure C57BL/6 genetic background. Section and whole-mount immunofluorescence for testicular and ovarian markers showed that XY Sox9 heterozygous gonads developed as ovotestes. Quantitative droplet digital PCR confirmed a 50% reduction of Sox9 mRNA as well as partial sex reversal shown by an upregulation of ovarian genes. Our data show that haploinsufficiency of Sox9 can perturb testis development in mice, suggesting that mice may provide a more accurate model of human disorders/differences of sex development (DSD) than previously thought.","Bagheri-Fam, Stefan; Combes, Alexander N; Ling, Cheuk K; Wilhelm, Dagmar",Human molecular genetics,https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddaa259; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305798/,52

METHODS Over a 44-month period, 61 adult patients with 1 or 2 painful bone metastases with a score of 4 or more on a scale of 0 to 10 (≥4/10) worst pain in a 24-hour period who had failed or refused conventional treatment were treated with percutaneous image-guided cryoablation. Patient pain and quality of life was measured using the Brief Pain Inventory prior to treatment, 1 and 4 days after the procedure, weekly for 4 weeks, and every 2 weeks thereafter for a total of 6 months. Patient analgesic use was also recorded at these same follow-up intervals. Complications were monitored. Analysis of the primary endpoint was undertaken via paired comparison procedures. RESULTS A total of 69 treated tumors ranged in size from 1 to 11 cm. Prior to cryoablation, the mean score for worst pain in a 24-hour period was 7.1/10 with a range of 4/10 to 10/10. At 1, 4, 8, and 24 weeks after treatment, the mean score for worst pain in a 24-hour period decreased to 5.1/10 (P < .0001), 4.0/10 (P < .0001), 3.6/10 (P < .0001), and 1.4/10 (P < .0001), respectively.

However, can it be used for the expression of an allogenetic fragment? To answer this question, a BVDV chimeric virus expressing the spike (S) antigen fragment of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was constructed. Antigen S499-602 was inserted into pig-derived BVDV-2 infectious cDNA clone pASH28 in tandem by overlapping PCR, located between the seventh and eighth amino acids at the N-terminus of the capsid (C) protein of BVDV. Indirect immunofluorescence assay confirmed that the chimeric virus vASH-dS312 containing double S499-602 sequences was successfully assembled, which could react with the monoclonal antibody (MAb) against BVDV E2 and PEDV S proteins. Further western blot analysis confirmed that the exogenous S499-602 double protein could be stably expressed. Next, the chimeric virus vASH-dS312 was administered to BALB/C mice either orally or by intramuscular injection. The immunized mice were healthy and showed no signs of toxicity. IgG against BVDV and PEDV antibodies could be detected in the mice administered vASH-dS312 by intramuscular injection, which had neutralization activity against BVDV and PEDV. Thus, this study reported a new insertion site in the BVDV infectious cDNA clone that could successfully express an allogenetic antigen.","Tao, Jie; Li, Benqiang; YingShi,; Chen, Jinghua; Zhu, Guoqiang; Shen, Xiaohui; Liu, Huili",Journal of virological methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2020.113842; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32135175/,52

Cystic fibrosis (CF) has been identified as a possible risk factor of poor outcome. RECENT FINDINGS Data collected by multiple National CF registries around the world have indicated that persons with CF (PwCF) are not more likely to be affected by SARS-CoV-2 than the general population. The course of SARS-CoV-2 is usually mild in PwCF who are relatively young. Severe outcomes have been described in patients with low lung function and in those with immune suppression (i.e. solid organ transplantation). Indirect impact of the pandemic on the CF community has also been observed, including difficulties in the organization of CF care, leading to a dramatic increase in telehealth for PwCF. The pandemic has further affected clinical research by complicating ongoing clinical trials. Vaccination appears important to all PwCF, with special priority on developing adequate vaccination scheme for transplant recipients.

63174,On the Offensive: the Role of Outer Membrane Vesicles in the Successful Dissemination of New Delhi Metallo-β-lactamase (NDM-1).,2021-09-28,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Although the etiology of MS is unknown, genetic and environmental factors play a role. Infectious pathogens are the likely environmental factors involved in the development of MS. Pathogens associated with the development or exacerbation of MS include bacteria, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae, the Staphylococcus aureus-produced enterotoxins that function as superantigens, viruses of the herpes virus (Epstein-Barr virus and human herpesvirus 6) and human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) families and the protozoa Acanthamoeba castellanii. Evidence, from studies with humans and animal models, supporting the association of these various pathogens with the development and/or exacerbation of MS will be discussed along with the potential mechanisms including molecular mimicry, epitope spreading and bystander activation. In contrast, infection with certain parasites such as helminthes (Schistosoma mansoni, Fasciola hepatica, Hymenolepis nana, Trichuris trichiura, Ascaris lumbricoides, Strongyloides stercolaris, Enterobius vermicularis) appears to protect against the development or exacerbation of MS. Evidence supporting the ability of parasitic infections to protect against disease will be discussed along with a brief summary of a recent Phase I clinical trial testing the ability of Trichuris suis ova treatment to improve the clinical course of MS. A complex interaction between the CNS (including the blood-brain barrier), multiple infections with various infectious agents (occurring in the periphery or within the CNS), and the immune response to those various infections may have to be deciphered before the etiology of MS can be fully understood.","Libbey, Jane E; Cusick, Matthew F; Fujinami, Robert S",International reviews of immunology,https://doi.org/10.3109/08830185.2013.823422; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24266364/,52
64077,Elective use of cannula cricothyroidotomy.,2011,"The management of a foodborne outbreak depends on the rapid and accurate identification of the responsible food source. Conventional methods based on isolation of the pathogen from the food matrix and target-specific real-time polymerase chain reactions (qPCRs) are used in routine. In recent years, the use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of bacterial isolates has proven its value to collect relevant information for strain characterization as well as tracing the origin of the contamination by linking the food isolate with the patient's isolate with high resolution. However, the isolation of a bacterial pathogen from food matrices is often time-consuming and not always successful. Therefore, we aimed to improve outbreak investigation by developing a method that can be implemented in reference laboratories to characterize the pathogen in the food vehicle without its prior isolation and link it back to human cases. We tested and validated a shotgun metagenomics approach by spiking food pathogens in specific food matrices using the Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) as a case study. Different DNA extraction kits and enrichment procedures were investigated to obtain the most practical workflow. We demonstrated the feasibility of shotgun metagenomics to obtain the same information as in ISO/TS 13136:2012 and WGS of the isolate in parallel by inferring the genome of the contaminant and characterizing it in a shorter timeframe. This was achieved in food samples containing different E. coli strains, including a combination of different STEC strains. For the first time, we also managed to link individual strains from a food product to isolates from human cases, demonstrating the power of shotgun metagenomics for rapid outbreak investigation and source tracking.","Buytaers, Florence E; Saltykova, Assia; Denayer, Sarah; Verhaegen, Bavo; Vanneste, Kevin; Roosens, Nancy H C; Piérard, Denis; Marchal, Kathleen; De Keersmaecker, Sigrid C J",Microorganisms,https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms8081191; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764329/,52

However, some anastomosis-related surgical complications have been reported. We evaluated the safety and feasibility of modified Delta-SA, called intracorporeal triangular anastomotic technique (INTACT), in this study. METHODS From January 2010 to May 2018, we identified patients who underwent TLDG B-I with INTACT (n = 289) and Delta-SA (n = 221). Using one-to-one propensity score matching, surgical outcomes and gastrointestinal function were compared between the two groups. RESULTS After one-to-one propensity score matching, 177 pairs of INTACT and Delta-SA patients were selected. Patient background was closely balanced between the two groups. Operative time (186 [159, 213] min vs. 237 [213, 264] min; P < 0.001), estimated blood loss (0 [0, 10] g vs. 20 [0, 50] g; P < 0.001), and postoperative hospital stay (7 [7, 9] days vs. 10 [9, 13] days; P < 0.001) were significantly lower in the INTACT group than in Delta-SA group. There were no patients with postoperative leakage in the INTACT group and three patients in the Delta group (0.0% vs. 1.7%; P = 0.041). Endoscopic food residue grade ≥ 3 based on the Residue, Gastritis, Bile classification system at 1 year after surgery was observed in 14 patients in the INTACT group and 30 patients in the Delta group (9.6% vs. 17.0%; P = 0.052). CONCLUSION INTACT in TLDG B-I is safe and feasible for gastric cancer. Given its acceptable surgical outcomes, this alternative reconstruction method can be an option with TLDG B-I.","Yanagimoto, Yoshitomo; Omori, Takeshi; Fujiwara, Yoshiyuki; Demura, Koichi; Jeong-Ho, Moon; Shinno, Naoki; Yamamoto, Kazuyoshi; Sugimura, Keijiro; Miyata, Hiroshi; Ushigome, Hajime; Takahashi, Yusuke; Nishimura, Junichi; Yasui, Masayoshi; Asukai, Kei; Yamada, Daisaku; Wada, Hiroshi; Takahashi, Hidenori; Ohue, Masayuki; Yano, Masahiko; Sakon, Masato",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-019-07025-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31385072/,52

64429,"1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 acts directly on the T lymphocyte vitamin D receptor to inhibit experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.",2011,"INTRODUCTION This paper reports on the findings of the Nursing and Midwifery Exchange Program, initiated to promote rural and remote nursing and midwifery, and to facilitate clinical skills development and clinical collaboration between health services in Queensland, Australia. The project was undertaken over an 18-month period in one state of Australia, offering structured, temporary exchange of personnel between metropolitan and rural health services. BACKGROUND Globally, there is an increasing awareness of nursing shortages, and with it, the need to ensure that nurses and midwives are prepared for specialist roles and practice. This is particularly important in rural and remote areas, where there are pre-existing barriers to access to services, and difficulties in attracting suitably qualified, permanent staff. METHODS A mixed methods approach to the evaluation was undertaken with two cohorts. One cohort was the nurses and midwives who participated in the exchange (n = 24) and the other cohort were managers of the participating health services (n = 10). The nurses and midwives who participated in the exchange were asked to complete a questionnaire that included questions related to embeddedness and job satisfaction. The managers participated in a Delphi series of interviews. RESULTS Those who participated in exchange reporting a higher score on the reported degree of understanding of rural client, which was accompanied with a moderate-to-large effect size estimate (d = 0.61). Nurses/midwives in the exchange group reported higher scores on their perceptions of aspects of their home community that would be lost if they had to leave, which was accompanied with a large effect size (d = 0.83). Overall, NMEP was reported by the participants to be a positive way to improve professional development opportunities for nurses and midwives. The findings also show the program supported practical collaboration and raised the profile of nursing and midwifery in rural areas. CONCLUSION Exchange programs support clinical and professional development, raising the awareness of different contexts of practice and related skills requirements, and thereby supporting a greater understanding of different nursing roles. In the light of increasingly complex care required by patients with chronic conditions being managed in community-based services, programs such as NMEP provide the opportunity to build collaborative networks between referring and referral centres as well as contribute to the ongoing skills development.","Byrne, Amy-Louise; Harvey, Clare; Chamberlain, Diane; Baldwin, Adele; Heritage, Brody; Wood, Elspeth",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609775/,52

While several different mass spectrometry based approaches have been proven to be useful in qualitative and quantitative analysis of sphingolipids, we find that electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) in the multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) mode using a triple quadrupole instrument, coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), is the most suitable approach for the analysis. In this chapter, we describe the method in a step-by-step manner towards the targeted analysis of sphingolipids in fungi. With optimized HPLC separation and instrument settings, this MRM approach affords detection of many sphingolipid species simultaneously with good sensitivity.","Singh, Ashutosh; Del Poeta, Maurizio",Methods in molecular biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-1410-5_16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33954951/,52

The use of an electronic faucet increases the hygiene, encourages hand washing, avoids touching the faucet for opening and closing, and it saves water, since the faucet is automatically closed. The microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology has the capability to convert environmental waste into energy. The implementation of low cost ceramic MFCs into electronic interfaces integrated in toilets, would offer a compact powering system as well as an environmentally friendly small-scale treatment plant. In this work, the use of low cost ceramic MFCs to power an L20-E electronic faucet is presented for the first time. A single MFC was capable of powering an electronic faucet with an open/close cycle of 8.5 min, with 200 ml of urine. With a footprint of 360 cm3, the MFC could easily be integrated in a toilet. The possibility to power e-toilet components with MFCs offers a sustainable energy generation system. Other electronic components including an automatic flush, could potentially be powered by MFCs and contribute to the maintenance efficiency and hygiene of the public toilets, leading to a new generation of self-sustained energy recovering e-toilets.","Merino Jimenez, Irene; Brinson, Patrick; Greenman, John; Ieropoulos, Ioannis",Journal of power sources,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34539048/,52

We prospectively evaluated serial 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-d-glucose positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and measurements of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and liberated domain I of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR(I)) for early assessment of treatment response in mCC patients. METHODS Thirty-three mCC patients scheduled for first-line chemotherapy with capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CAPOX) and bevacizumab participated; 27 were evaluated by PET/CT before treatment, after one and four treatment series. Morphological and metabolic response was independently assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer PET criteria. Plasma TIMP-1, plasma uPAR(I), and serum CEA were determined. RESULTS Metabolic response after one treatment course predicted the ability of CAPOX and bevacizumab to induce morphological response after four treatment series with a sensitivity of 80%, specificity of 69%, and odds ratio of 13.9 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9; 182). Early metabolically stable or progressive disease was associated with shorter progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.2 [CI 1.3; 7.8]). Biomarker levels at early evaluation were associated with shorter OS (TIMP-1 per unit increase on a log-2-transformed ng/mL scale: HR = 2.6 [CI 1.4; 4.9]; uPAR(I) per 25 fmol/mL increase: HR = 1.5 [CI 1.1; 2.1]). CONCLUSION This monocentric study demonstrated predictive value of early metabolic PET response and prognostic value of TIMP-1 and uPAR(I) levels in mCC treated with CAPOX and bevacizumab. Results support investigation of PET/CT, TIMP-1, and uPAR(I) guided early treatment adaptation in mCC.","Engelmann, Bodil E; Loft, Annika; Kjær, Andreas; Nielsen, Hans J; Gerds, Thomas A; Benzon, Eric V; Brünner, Nils; Christensen, Ib J; Hansson, Susanne H; Holländer, Niels H; Kristensen, Michael H; Löfgren, Johan; Markova, Elena; Sloth, Carsten; Højgaard, Liselotte",The oncologist,https://doi.org/10.1634/theoncologist.2013-0229; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24451199/,52

PATIENTS AND METHODS Five hundred consecutive patients underwent LRP during a 28-month period with a minimum follow-up of 12 months. Median age (with range) = 61.0 (33-76) years; prostate-specific antigen level = 7.0 (1-37); biopsy Gleason sum = 7 (4-10). Clinical stage was T1 in 41.0%, T2 in 54.2%, and T3 in 4.8%. Nerve preservation (NP) was performed bilaterally in 57.9%, unilaterally in 15.3%, and on neither side in 26.8%. RESULTS Median operative time was 157 (91-331) minutes, with no conversions or intraoperative blood transfusions; 0.4% of patients received a transfusion postoperatively, and 4.2% had complications. There were no rectal injuries. The overall positive margin rate was 13.0% and correlated with pathologic parameters. At a minimum of 1 year follow-up (mean=13.5 (12-36) mos), overall survival was 100%, and biochemical disease-free survival was 98.8%. The pad-free rate was 97.4%. Potency (International Index of Erectile Function-5 score ≥17) at a mean follow-up of 13.5 months in previously potent men in their 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th decades after bilateral NP was 100.0%, 91.8%, 82.9%, and 60.0% and after unilateral NP was 100%, 66.7%, 50.1%, and 0.0%. Overall potency after bilateral neurovascular bundle NVB preservation was 86.9%. CONCLUSION LRP is capable of matching or exceeding the best results for open radical prostatectomy and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy when performed by an experienced surgeon in a high-volume setting. These results suggest that the method used to perform radical prostatectomy is a less important determinant of success than surgical experience.","Eden, Christopher G; Arora, Avanish; Hutton, Anthony",Journal of endourology,https://doi.org/10.1089/end.2010.0451; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21510804/,52

Geriatric populations affected by dementia require greater access to healthcare services, particularly in rural areas. As such, the aim of this systematic review is to examine the impact of telemedicine on health outcomes in elderly individuals with dementia living in rural areas. METHODS A systematic review was completed using Ovid Medline, Web of Science and ACM Digital Libraries. The keywords for the selection of articles were: (telemedicine OR Telehealth) AND (Rural) AND (Age* OR Eld*) AND (Dementia) and (Telemedicine) AND (Rural Health OR Rural Population OR Hospitals, Rural OR Rural Health Services) AND (Aged OR Aging) AND (Dementia OR Multi-Infarct Dementia OR Vascular Dementia OR Frontotemporal Dementia). Among the 94 articles identified, 79 (84.0 %) were screened, 58 (61.7 %) were assessed and 12 (12.8 %) were included. RESULTS The studies had diverse populations. Two were conducted in Australia, five in Canada, one in Korea, and four in the United States of America. The studies used a variety of cognitive tests and reported mixed results regarding the differences in patient performance when assessed in-person as compared to telemedicine consultation. Overall, both patients and physicians reported satisfaction with telemedicine; however, there were mixed results regarding the reliability of cognitive tests and the infrastructure required. Convenience, satisfaction, comfort and recommending telemedicine were reported to be high in the telemedicine group and physicians reported they would use telemedicine again. CONCLUSION The testing conditions and the accessibility of telemedicine yield inconclusive results as to whether telemedicine can improve the management of dementia in geriatric individuals.","Sekhon, Harmehr; Sekhon, Kerman; Launay, Cyrille; Afililo, Marc; Innocente, Nathan; Vahia, Ipsit; Rej, Soham; Beauchet, Olivier",Maturitas,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.maturitas.2020.09.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33308615/,52

METHODS We retrospectively enrolled 620 consecutive patients from January 2011 to December 2011 (75.6 ± 12.3 years, 355 males, 76.5% in Rutherford class 5-6), referred for critical limb ischemia and submitted to prolonged high-pressure angioplasty of femoropopliteal lesions. The definition of prolonged high-pressure angioplasty includes dilation to at least 18 atm for at least 120 s. Procedural data, and clinical and instrumental follow-up were analyzed to assess stent implantation rate and mid-term outcomes. RESULTS The preferred approach was ipsilateral femoral antegrade in 433/620 patients (69.7%) and contralateral cross-over in 164/620 (26.4%) and popliteal retrograde + femoral antegrade in 23/620 (3.7%). Techniques included subintimal angioplasty in 427/620 patients (68.8%) and endoluminal angioplasty in 193/620 patients (31.2%). The prolonged high pressure balloon angioplasty procedure was successful in 86.2% (minor intra-procedural complications rate 15.7 %), stent implantation was performed in 74 patients (11.9%), with a significant improvement of ankle-brachial index (0.29 ± 0.6 vs. 0.88 ± 0.3, P < 00.1) and Rutherford class (5.3 ± 0.8 vs. 0.7 ± 1.9, P < 0.01), a primary patency rate of 86.7%, restenosis of 18.6 % on Doppler ultrasound and a target lesion revascularization of 14.8% at a mean follow-up of 18.1 ± 6.4 months (range 1-24 months).

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the medical record, angiograms, and intravascular ultrasound images of 22 aorto-ostial percutaneous coronary interventions performed at our institution between March and September 2015. The Flash Ostial system was used in 13 cases (59%). RESULTS Mean age was 67 ± 8 years and all patients were men. The target vessel was the right coronary artery (59%), left main (27%), or a saphenous vein graft (14%); 59% of the lesions had moderate/severe calcification. The mean number of predilation balloons was 1.8 ± 1.6, mean Flash ostial balloon diameter was 3.3 ± 0.5 mm and mean inflation pressure was 13.1 ± 4.0 atmospheres. Intravascular ultrasonography (available for 19 patients) revealed mean ostial minimum lumen cross-sectional area (MLA) of 9.2 ± 3.0 mm2 and reference MLA of 8.5 ± 2.7 mm2 . The percent difference between ostial and reference MLA was higher in cases in which the Flash Ostial system was used versus those where it was not (9.6 ± 5.5% vs. 4.0 ± 2.8%, P = 0.03). All stent struts were well apposed. Technical success was 100%. One patient developed a left groin pseudoaneurysm treated with thrombin injection and one patient had a periprocedural myocardial infarction. Median contrast, fluoroscopy time, and procedure time were 235 mL, 33 min, and 118 min, respectively.

Fear of hypoglycaemia is a hurdle to effective correction of hyperglycaemia because it promotes under-dosing of insulin. Strategies to minimise hypoglycaemia include education and training for improved hypoglycaemia awareness and the development of technologies to allow their early detection and thus minimise their occurrence. Patients with impaired hypoglycaemia awareness would benefit the most from these technologies. The purpose of this systematic review is to review currently available or in-development technologies that support detection of hypoglycaemia or hypoglycaemia risk, and identify gaps in the research. Nanomaterial use in sensors is a promising strategy to increase the accuracy of continuous glucose monitoring devices for low glucose values. Hypoglycaemia is associated with changes on vital signs, so electrocardiogram and encephalogram could also be used to detect hypoglycaemia. Accuracy improvements through multivariable measures can make already marketed galvanic skin response devices a good noninvasive alternative. Breath volatile organic compounds can be detected by dogs and devices and alert patients at hypoglycaemia onset, while near-infrared spectroscopy can also be used as a hypoglycaemia alarms. Finally, one of the main directions of research are deep learning algorithms to analyse continuous glucose monitoring data and provide earlier and more accurate prediction of hypoglycaemia. Current developments for early identification of hypoglycaemia risk combine improvements of available 'needle-type' enzymatic glucose sensors and noninvasive alternatives. Patient usability will be essential to demonstrate to allow their implementation for daily use in diabetes management.","Diouri, Omar; Cigler, Monika; Vettoretti, Martina; Mader, Julia K; Choudhary, Pratik; Renard, Eric",Diabetes/metabolism research and reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/dmrr.3449; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763974/,52

AIM To describe the institutional experience using a knotless unidirectional barbed suture (V-Loc 180/Covidien, Mansfield, MA) to create a hand-sewn gastrojejunostomy (GJ) and jejunojejunostomy (JJ) during bariatric surgery. METHODS Evaluation of a case series of 87 morbidly obese patients who underwent laparoscopic gastric bypass with a hand-sewn gastrojejunostomy (GJA) and jejunojejunostomy (JJA) between 01/2015 and 06/2017. The patients were divided into two groups: in group I, GJA und JJA sutures were performed using the knotless unidirectional barbed suture; in group II, GJA and JJA were sutured with resorbable multifilament thread (Vicryl® 3/0 Ethicon, Livingstone, UK). The recorded data on gender, age, BMI, ASA score, operative time, postoperative morbidity, length of hospital stay, and reoperation, were analyzed and compared. RESULTS All procedures were completed laparoscopically with no mortality. The mean operative time was 123.23 (±30.631) in group I and 127.57 (±42.772) in group II (p<0.05). The postoperative complications did not differ significantly between the two groups. Early complications were observed for two patients (0.9%) in the barbed suture group and for one patient (0.42%) in the multifilament suture group (p<0.05). In group I two patients (0.9%) required reoperation: on the basis of jejunojejunal stenosis in one patient, and local abscess near the gastrojejunostomy, without a leakage, in the other. In group II one patient (0.42%) required reoperation due to stenosis of the GJA. The duration of hospital admission was similar for both groups: 3.36 (±0.743) days in group I vs. 3.38 (±1.058) days in group II (p<0.05). CONCLUSION The novel anastomotic technique is a safe and effective method and can be applied to gastrojejunal anastomosis and jejunojejunal anastomosis in laparoscopic gastric bypass.","Bures, Claudia; Seika, Philippa; Denecke, Christian; Pratschke, Johann; Zorron, Ricardo",Arquivos brasileiros de cirurgia digestiva : ABCD = Brazilian archives of digestive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1590/0102-672020190001e1452; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644672/,52

Non-human primates, canines, and porcine are considered more adequate models for biomedical research and drug development purposes, mainly due to their physiological, genetic, and anatomical similarities to humans. The swine model has gained particular interest in translational neuroscience, enabling safety and allotransplantation testing. Herein the generation of porcine iPSCs is described along with its further differentiation into neural progenitor cells (NPCs). The generated cells expressed NPC markers Nestin and GFAP, confirmed by RT-qPCR, and were positive for Nestin, b-Tubulin III, and Vimentin by immunofluorescence. These results show the evidence for the generation of NPC-like cells after in vitro induction with chemical inhibitors from a large animal model, an interesting and adequate model for regenerative and translational medicine research.","Machado, Lucas Simões; Recchia, Kaiana; Pieri, Naira Caroline Godoy; Botigelli, Ramon Cesar; de Castro, Raquel Vasconcelos Guimarães; Brunhara Cruz, Jéssica; Pessôa, Laís Vicari de Figueiredo; Bressan, Fabiana Fernandes",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/62209; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180882/,52
69660,Sterile inflammation in thoracic transplantation.,2020-08-17,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic with the stay-at-home orders and lockdown has dramatically forced athletes to stop team training and competitions, causing deep changes in habits and lifestyle. Aim of this study was to evaluate in a retrospective single center study the cardiovascular (CV) health and fitness of elite football player after COVID-19 lockdown in Italy and to compare such findings with the 2019 off-season period, in order to identify potential differences in the CV features and outcomes. METHODS All 29 professional Football players of the first male team were enrolled before resuming training and competition after COVID-19 lockdown and underwent several exams including physical examination, resting and stress electrocardiography (ECG), echocardiography, spirometry and blood tests. RESULTS Median age was 27 years (23; 31), with no athlete being COVID-19 positive at the time of the evaluation. In comparison with the usual off-season 2-month detraining, significant differences were found for left ventricular (LV) mass (189g [172; 212] vs. 181g [167; 206], p=0.024) and LV mass index for body surface area (94g/m2 [85; 104] vs 88g/m2 [79.5; 101.5], p=0.017), while LV mass/fat free mass remained unchanged (2.8 g/Kg [2.6; 2.9] vs 2.9 g/Kg [2.6; 3.2], p=0.222). Respiratory function and metabolic profile were improved, while no significant changes were found in ECG findings, at rest and during exercise. CONCLUSIONS Prolonged abstinence from training and competitions induced by lockdown elicited significant changes in comparison with off-season in parameters ascribable to detraining, as the changes in LV mass, in respiratory function and in metabolic profile.","Cavarretta, Elena; D'Angeli, Ilaria; Giammarinaro, Maura; Gervasi, Salvatore; Fanchini, Maurizio; Causarano, Andrea; Costa, Vincenzo; Manara, Massimo; Terribili, Noemi; Sciarra, Luigi; CalÒ, Leonardo; Fossati, Chiara; Peruzzi, Mariangela; Versaci, Francesco; Carnevale, Roberto; Biondi-Zoccai, Giuseppe; Frati, Giacomo",Panminerva medica,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0031-0808.21.04340-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33565761/,52

In this study of more than one million non-COVID-19 visits to thirteen EDs in a large St. Louis, Missouri, health system, we observed an overall 35 percent decline in ED visits. The decrease in medical and surgical visits ranged from 40 percent to 52 percent across acuity levels, with no statistically significant differences between higher- and lower-acuity visits after correction for multiple comparisons. Mental health visits saw a smaller decrease (-32 percent), and there was no decrease for visits due to substance use. Medicare patients had the smallest decrease in visits (-31 percent) of the insurance groups; privately insured (-46 percent) and Medicaid (-44 percent) patients saw larger drops. There were no observable differences in ED visit decreases by race.

69934,Population proteomics: investigation of protein diversity in human populations.,2008,"ABSTRACT The American Cancer Society (ACS) released updated cervical cancer screening guidelines in 2020 that endorse a shift in practice to primary human papillomavirus (HPV) screening in people with a cervix, beginning at ages of 25-65 years. When access to US Food and Drug Administration-approved primary HPV testing is not available, the ACS offers cotesting or cytology as acceptable alternative strategies but suggests that these testing modalities may be excluded from future iterations of the guidelines. The ASCCP recognizes the benefits and risks of primary HPV cervical cancer screening while acknowledging the barriers to widespread adoption, including implementation issues, the impact of limited HPV vaccination in the United States, and inclusion of populations who may not be well represented on primary HPV screening trials, such as underrepresented minorities. The ASCCP endorses the 2018 US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement and supports the ACS cervical cancer screening guidelines. Most importantly, the ASCCP endorses any cervical cancer screening for secondary prevention of cervical cancer and recommends interventions that improve screening for those who are underscreened or unscreened.","Marcus, Jenna Z; Cason, Patty; Downs, Levi S; Einstein, Mark H; Flowers, Lisa",Journal of lower genital tract disease,https://doi.org/10.1097/lgt.0000000000000614; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34138787/,52
70539,Hormonal Signaling Actions on Kv7.1 (KCNQ1) Channels.,2020-07-15,"BACKGROUND Mobile ecological momentary assessment (mEMA) permits real-time capture of self-reported participant behaviors and perceptual experiences. Reporting of mEMA protocols and compliance has been identified as problematic within systematic reviews of children, youth, and specific clinical populations of adults. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to describe the use of mEMA for self-reported behaviors and psychological constructs, mEMA protocol and compliance reporting, and associations between key components of mEMA protocols and compliance in studies of nonclinical and clinical samples of adults. METHODS In total, 9 electronic databases were searched (2006-2016) for observational studies reporting compliance to mEMA for health-related data from adults (>18 years) in nonclinical and clinical settings. Screening and data extraction were undertaken by independent reviewers, with discrepancies resolved by consensus. Narrative synthesis described participants, mEMA target, protocol, and compliance. Random effects meta-analysis explored factors associated with cohort compliance (monitoring duration, daily prompt frequency or schedule, device type, training, incentives, and burden score). Random effects analysis of variance (P≤.05) assessed differences between nonclinical and clinical data sets. RESULTS Of the 168 eligible studies, 97/105 (57.7%) reported compliance in unique data sets (nonclinical=64/105 [61%], clinical=41/105 [39%]). The most common self-reported mEMA target was affect (primary target: 31/105, 29.5% data sets; secondary target: 50/105, 47.6% data sets). The median duration of the mEMA protocol was 7 days (nonclinical=7, clinical=12). Most protocols used a single time-based (random or interval) prompt type (69/105, 65.7%); median prompt frequency was 5 per day. The median number of items per prompt was similar for nonclinical (8) and clinical data sets (10). More than half of the data sets reported mEMA training (84/105, 80%) and provision of participant incentives (66/105, 62.9%). Less than half of the data sets reported number of prompts delivered (22/105, 21%), answered (43/105, 41%), criterion for valid mEMA data (37/105, 35.2%), or response latency (38/105, 36.2%). Meta-analysis (nonclinical=41, clinical=27) estimated an overall compliance of 81.9% (95% CI 79.1-84.4), with no significant difference between nonclinical and clinical data sets or estimates before or after data exclusions. Compliance was associated with prompts per day and items per prompt for nonclinical data sets. Although widespread heterogeneity existed across analysis (I2>90%), no compelling relationship was identified between key features of mEMA protocols representing burden and mEMA compliance. CONCLUSIONS In this 10-year sample of studies using the mEMA of self-reported health-related behaviors and psychological constructs in adult nonclinical and clinical populations, mEMA was applied across contexts and health conditions and to collect a range of health-related data. There was inconsistent reporting of compliance and key features within protocols, which limited the ability to confidently identify components of mEMA schedules likely to have a specific impact on compliance.","Williams, Marie T; Lewthwaite, Hayley; Fraysse, François; Gajewska, Alexandra; Ignatavicius, Jordan; Ferrar, Katia",Journal of medical Internet research,https://doi.org/10.2196/17023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33656451/,52

In the current study, we aimed to decipher the impact of membrane-associated gB on adhesion and migration of cells via modulating the expression of cytokines. METHODS A combination of polymerase chain reaction array, cell adhesion assay, and wound-healing migration assay was conducted to study the influence of the gB-induced cytokines on cell adhesion and migration. RESULTS Membrane-associated gB was demonstrated to significantly upregulate the expression of IL-1β and TNF-α. Elevated levels of these cytokines were observed in conditioned medium (CM) collected from gB-expressing cells (gB-CM) compared to CM collected from untransfected cells or cells transfected with empty vector. KSHV gB-induced IL-1β and TNF-α play a role in the ability of gB-CM to mediate cell adhesion while inhibiting migration. CONCLUSION Our results provide novel evidence that demonstrates full-length gB expressed on cell membrane to mediate adhesion and inhibit migration of cells not only by autocrine mechanism mediated by RGD-based interactions [Hussein et al.: BMC Cancer 2016; 16: 148], but also by paracrine mechanism mediated by gB-induced IL-1β and TNF-α.","Hussein, Hosni A M; Abdel-Raouf, Usama M; Akula, Shaw M",Intervirology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000487596; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29597230/,52
70594,Gene Expression Changes in Irradiated Baboons: A Summary and Interpretation of a Decade of Findings.,2021-03-31,"Microtubules display dynamic turnover during cell migration, leading to cell contractility and focal adhesion maturation regulated by Rho guanosine triphosphatase activity. This interplay between microtubules and actomyosin is mediated by guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)-H1 released after microtubule depolymerization or microtubule disconnection from focal adhesions. However, how GEF-H1 activates Rho upon microtubule disassembly remains elusive. Here, we found that BNIP-2, a BCH domain-containing protein that binds both RhoA and GEF-H1 and traffics with kinesin-1 on microtubules, is important for GEF-H1-driven RhoA activation upon microtubule disassembly. Depletion of BNIP-2 in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells decreases RhoA activity and promotes cell migration. Upon nocodazole-induced microtubule disassembly, the interaction between BNIP-2 and GEF-H1 increases, while knockdown of BNIP-2 reduces RhoA activation and cell rounding via uncoupling RhoA-GEF-H1 interaction. Together, these findings revealed that BNIP-2 couples microtubules and focal adhesions via scaffolding GEF-H1 and RhoA, fine-tuning RhoA activity and cell migration.","Pan, Meng; Chew, Ti Weng; Wong, Darren Chen Pei; Xiao, Jingwei; Ong, Hui Ting; Chin, Jasmine Fei Li; Low, Boon Chuan",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aaz1534; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32789168/,52

However, subgroup analysis of ACTT-1 Study Group showed an apparent reduction in mortality for patients who required non‑high-flow oxygen. Presentation of SOLIDARITY study results were associated by a meta-analysis combining mortality results by subsets rom randomized clinical trials. The aim is a methodological assessment of reliability and clinical applicability about findings by subgroups on the effect of remdesivir on mortality in patients with COVID-19. METHOD A validated tool was used to evaluate the findings of subgroup analyses in randomized clinical trials, including meta-analysis atached to SOLIDARITY study. It is structured in preliminary questions to reject subset analyses without relevant minimum conditions, and a specific checklist. The latter considers certain criteria: statistical association, which encompassed p of interaction, prespecification of subgroups, sample size, number of factors analyzed, and overall study result; biological plausibility of observed differences; and consistency between results of similar studies. A score was assigned to each criterion and the tool related global summation to a recommendation on the applicability of subset results in clinical decision making. RESULTS Preliminary questions had positive answers, so checklist was applied. Statistical association obtained ""null"" assessment (-3 points), including a ""doubtful"" p of interaction (p = 0.0650) among subgroups and mortality reached no statistical significance for global population. These findings reduced the reliability of subset analysis. Biological plausibility was considered ""probable"" (+3 points) because antiviral could have a greater effect before the inflammatory process and clinical worsening. Consistency between results of similar studies was evaluated as ""possible"" (+2 points) analysis for compatibility of ACTT-1 and SOLIDARITY study results. The recommendation about application of subset analysis results according to the risk of patients was ""null"". CONCLUSIONS This structured interpretation of subgroup analysis suggested too much uncertainty in hypothesis about remdesivir could reduce mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 who required non-high- flow oxygen. It was probably a random finding. Therefore, a randomized clinical trial about effect of remdesivir in mortality in patients with COVID‑19 and non-high-flow oxygen is essential.","Alegre-Del Rey, Emilio Jesús; Gil-Sierra, Manuel David; Alarcón de la Lastra-Romero, Catalina; Sánchez-Hidalgo, Marina",Farmacia hospitalaria : organo oficial de expresion cientifica de la Sociedad Espanola de Farmacia Hospitalaria,https://doi.org/10.7399/fh.11591; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33443475/,52

Methods From March to April 2020, all of the COPD patients treated in our department in the last 7 years were interviewed by telephone. The basic patient data and each questionnaire item were collected, and influencing factors were analyzed by the Chi-square test, U test, and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Results A total of 191 patients with COPD were queried, and 84 (44.0%) valid questionnaires were obtained. Among them, individuals with group B symptoms were most represented (45.2%); 53.6% had Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnea levels of 2 or above. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease assessment test (CAT) had an average of 9 [3, 13], and 52.4% of patients used two-drug combination therapy. Medication adherence was both good in ordinary times and over the past 2 months of the pandemic, and 88.8% of patients had no acute exacerbation during the pandemic. The CAT scores of male patients <70 years old, and patients with general outpatient follow-up and regular gargling were reduced (P<0.05). Drug combination and doctor's supervision were favorable factors affecting medication adherence during the 2 months of the pandemic, while possible depression was an unfavorable factor (P<0.05). Conclusions During the pandemic, medication adherence in patients with COPD was similar to that in regular times, and was significantly related to drug combination, doctor's supervision, and accompanying mood disorders. An effective way to improve patient adherence and disease control could be strengthening follow-up education and diagnosing and treating depression and other complications.","Zhang, Hai-Qin; Lin, Jia-Yuan; Guo, Yi; Pang, Shuai; Jiang, Ren; Cheng, Qi-Jian",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-6016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33241028/,52

It has been demonstrated that cationic microbubbles can be loaded with negatively charged plasmid DNA and thus improve gene transfection efficiency. In this study, we developed dual-targeting cationic microbubbles conjugated with iRGD peptides(Cyclo(Cys-Arg-Gly-Asp-Lys-Gly-Pro-Asp-Cys)) and CCR2 (chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2) antibodies (MBiRGD/CCR2) for ultrasound molecular imaging and targeted tumor gene therapy. The ultrasound molecular imaging experiments showed that there were significantly enhanced ultrasound molecular imaging signals in the tumor that received MBiRGD/CCR2, compared with those that received MBiRGD, MBCCR2, or MBcontrol. As a therapy plasmid, pGPU6/GFP/Neo-shAKT2, carrying an expression cassette for the human AKT2 RNA interference sequence, was used. Our results demonstrated that MBiRGD/CCR2 had a significantly higher gene transfection efficiency than MBiRGD, MBCCR2, or MBcontrol under ultrasound irradiation, resulting in much lower AKT2 protein expression and stronger tumor growth inhibition effects in vivo and in vitro.

We aim to identify the spectrum of medical causes of mortality in our ED, the demographic pattern and duration of stay before death. Method This is a retrospective study that looked at medical mortality in the ED from January 2004 to December 2009. We obtained data on the demographics and causes of death from the medical records and case notes of the deceased. Results A total of 16587 patients were admitted during the period under review, of these 1262 (7.61%) died in the ED. The male to female ratio was 1.58:1.0 [772 males (61.2%), and 489 females (38.8%)]. Mortality was highest among the 20-45 years age range, followed by 46-65 years, >65 years and < 20 years in decreasing frequency [589(46.7%), 421(33.4%), 186 (14.8%) and 66(5.2%) respectively]. The three most common causes of death were stroke 315(25%), HIV related illnesses 126(10.0%), and heart failure 123(9.7%). Most deaths occurred less than 24hours of admission, 550(43.6%), followed by one day (36.0%) and two days (10.8%) post admissions respectively. Conclusion The commonest cause of death in the ED was stroke. The burden of death was highest in the younger age group, with most occurring less than 24 hours of admission.","Olusegun-Joseph, A D; Akande, O; Otrofanowei, E; Nwoye, E O; Olopade, O B; Ajuluchukwu, J N",African health sciences,https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v21i1.23; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394295/,52

The underlying mechanism(s) remain unclear. The aim of this study was to identify genes potentially involved in the development of PSP. Microarray analysis was performed to identify specific gene expression patterns. Expression levels of genes identified to be significantly up- or down-regulated in association with PSP were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. Immunohistochemistry was performed to identify lung cell types highly expressing these genes. Microarray analysis revealed that expression levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-3 alpha (HIF-3alpha) and caspase-8 were significantly up-regulated in tissue from patients with PSP, whereas interferon-gamma, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8 were down-regulated (all P < .05). These genes are related to hypoxia, apoptosis, and inflammation. HIF-3alpha and caspase-8 protein levels were increased in samples from patients with PSP. HIF-3alpha and caspase-8 were localized in mesothelial cells, alveolar type II pneumocytes, and bronchoalveolar epithelial cells in samples from patients with PSP.

We describe a 15-month-old male patient with severe pruritus diagnosed with PFIC type 2 enrolled in an open-label phase 2 study who received 4 weeks of treatment with odevixibat, an ileal bile acid transporter inhibitor under development for cholestatic liver disease treatment. The patient experienced reductions in serum bile acids and improvement in itching and sleep scores, and odevixibat was well tolerated. After the odevixibat study, symptoms returned and the patient underwent partial external biliary diversion (PEBD). Odevixibat treatment and PEBD produced similar normalisation of serum bile acid levels and improvements in pruritus and sleep disruptions. Thus, odevixibat appeared to be as effective as invasive PEBD in treating serum bile acids and cholestatic pruritus in this patient.","Slavetinsky, Christoph; Sturm, Ekkehard",BMJ case reports,https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2019-234185; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32601135/,52

Three patients complained of retractile penis (when standing) and/or prepubic recession. Physical examination confirmed the shaft of the penis was buried with only the glans visible. All three patients reported lower levels of self-confidence, self-esteem, and sexual confidence prior to their procedure. The three patients received surgical treatment with the insertion of a subcutaneous soft silicone penile implant and two of the three also received removal of the suprapubic fat pad. Over one year post operatively, the penile shaft and glans was visible and appeared natural. All patients reported an increase in self-confidence and self-esteem. The insertion of a subcutaneous soft silicone penile implant may prove to be a viable solution to reverse retractile penis and to increase patient quality of life when compared to more invasive current surgical treatments.","Elist, James J; Baniqued, Matthew; Hosseini, Alireza; Wilson, Steven K",International journal of impotence research,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41443-019-0174-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31383992/,52

Most of the countries of the world are in a lockdown of varying severity to break the chain of transmission. Many non-essential healthcare practices have been shut down to impose social distancing against a population whose slogan has been freedom of movement. Several healthcare providers have also been caught off guard. Many are not well-versed in the use of transmission-based safeguards, and the dental community, is no different. In this article, we identify the challenges faced by the oral and dental care providers, whose procedures generate a significant amount of aerosol, which can be a significant source of disease transmission within the community. It further describes the dynamics of aerosol spread and various strategies to minimise aerosol generation.

Studies on the epidemiology and management of IIAs are limited to case reports and retrospective single-center studies, and report a large variability in epidemiological features, management, and outcomes due to the limited sample size. We conducted a systematic review of all published papers on IIAs in the English literature using MEDLINE and SCOPUS database from January 1950 to June 2017. A total of 288 publications describing 1191 patients with IIA (1398 aneurysms) were included and reviewed for epidemiological features, disease features, treatment and outcome. All patients were merged into a single cohort and summary data are presented. The majority of reported IIAs are distally located, relatively small (<5 mm), involve the anterior circulation, are associated with a relatively high rate of rupture, and demonstrate a propensity to multiplicity of aneurysms. Sensitive diagnosis of IIAs requires digital subtraction angiography and not CT angiography or MR angiography. Treatment of ruptured, symptomatic, or enlarging IIAs has evolved over the last 50 years. Endovascular therapy is associated with a high success rate and low morbidity compared with microsurgical and medical management. A treatment algorithm for the management of patients with IIA in various contexts is proposed and the need for prospective multicenter studies is emphasized.","Alawieh, Ali; Chaudry, M Imran; Turner, Raymond D; Turk, Aquilla S; Spiotta, Alejandro M",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2017-013603; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29463620/,52

Therefore, we aimed to analyze the same clinical issues through an improved research method and to find out the differences from the retracted papers. We systematically reviewed pre-existing literature, and compared the results with those of the retracted papers to gain a novel insight. MATERIALS AND METHODS We extracted common risk factors identified in two retracted papers, and conducted relevant publication search until June 26, 2020 in PubMed. Then, we analyzed the risk factors for COVID-19 mortality and compared them to those of the retracted papers. RESULTS Our systematic review demonstrated that most demographic and clinical risk factors for COVID-19 mortality were similar to those of the retracted papers. However, while the retracted paper indicated that both (hydroxy)chloroquine monotherapy and combination therapy with macrolide were associated with higher risk of mortality, our study showed that only combination therapy of hydroxychloroquine and macrolide was associated with higher risk of mortality (odds ratio 2.33; 95% confidence interval 1.63-3.34). In addition, our study demonstrated that use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) was associated with reduced risk of mortality (0.77; 0.65-0.91). CONCLUSIONS When analyzing the same clinical issues with the two retracted papers through a systematic review of randomized controlled trials and relevant cohort studies, we found out that (hydroxy)chloroquine monotherapy was not associated with higher risk of mortality, and that the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs was associated with reduced risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients.","Lee, K H; Kim, J S; Hong, S H; Seong, D; Choi, Y R; Ahn, Y T; Kim, K S; Kim, S E; Lee, S; Sim, W; Kim, D; Jun, B; Yang, J W; Yon, D K; Lee, S W; Kim, M S; Dragioti, E; Li, H; Jacob, L; Koyanagi, A; Abou Ghayda, R; Shin, J I; Smith, L",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202012_24216; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33378062/,52
76324,Viral Inactivation Impacts Microbiome Estimates in a Tissue-Specific Manner.,2021-10-05,"BACKGROUND Tumor cells in chronic lymphocytic leukemia accumulate in the periphery through the proliferation of a minority of cells in lymph nodes. The proliferative and survival signals in these proliferation centers include interactions with T lymphocytes expressing CD40 ligand. We have demonstrated that the low toxicity combination of bezafibrate and medroxyprogesterone acetate induces mitochondrial superoxide-mediated apoptosis of non-CD40-liganded cells but not of cells exposed to CD40 ligand. Here, we assessed the ability of dasatinib and lycorine to restore bezafibrate- and medroxyprogesterone acetate- induced apoptosis in cells exposed to CD40 ligand. In parallel experiments we compared the ability of dasatinib to induce apoptosis of cells co-treated with fludarabine. DESIGN AND METHODS Primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were exposed to drug combinations for 72 hours on control and CD40 ligand-expressing fibroblast monolayers. Cells were harvested and analyzed for apoptosis and levels of mitochondrial superoxide using flow cytometry. In some experiments cells were removed from CD40 ligand at 48 hours, retreated and analyzed after a further 24 hours. The effect of CD40 ligand and drug treatments on mitochondrial superoxide levels were assessed. RESULTS As previously described, dasatinib rendered cells sensitive to fludarabine but only when CD40 ligand was removed for the last 24 hours of culture. In contrast, lycorine restored the bezafibrate- and medroxyprogesterone acetate-induced apoptosis associated with mitochondrial superoxide even during continuous exposure to CD40 ligand. Furthermore, combined bezafibrate, medroxyprogesterone acetate and lycorine had little effect against normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, whereas dasatinib with fludarabine induced high levels of apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS Our data indicate the potential of bezafibrate, medroxyprogesterone acetate and lycorine as novel therapy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and have important implications for the reported potential of c-abl kinase inhibitors in this disease.","Hayden, Rachel E; Pratt, Guy; Drayson, Mark T; Bunce, Chris M",Haematologica,https://doi.org/10.3324/haematol.2010.027821; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20634492/,52

Emergency measures are being implemented to reduce the magnitude of the public health crisis, prevent healthcare facilities from becoming overwhelmed and reduce the death toll of the disease. Containment strategies to mitigate viral transmission and emergency measures to increase the capacity of each country to provide intensive care are at the forefront of the public health management of the epidemic, even though the detrimental social and psychological effects of quarantine are evident on a global scale. Optimal management of critically ill patients with COVID-19 is also unclear, and the initial suggestion for early intubation as in typical ARDS may have caused significant harm. The management of mild cases of confirmed infection is another point of controversy, as drugs which may be repurposed for COVID-19 treatment have significant, potentially irreversible toxic effects and their use in mild cases of a viral illness which is typically self-limited may be harmful.","Zareifopoulos, Nicholas; Lagadinou, Maria; Karela, Anastasia; Platanaki, Christina; Karantzogiannis, Gerasimos; Velissaris, Dimitrios",Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,https://doi.org/10.4081/monaldi.2020.1342; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32368884/,52

77763,Deciphering human γδ T cell response in cancer: Lessons from tumor-infiltrating γδ T cells.,2020-07-20,"Human cytomegalovirus modulates macroautophagy in two opposite directions. First, HCMV stimulates autophagy during the early stages of infection, as evident by an increase in the number of autophagosomes and a rise in the autophagic flux. This stimulation occurs independently of de novo viral protein synthesis since UV-inactivated HCMV recapitulates the stimulatory effect on macroautophagy. At later time points of infection, HCMV blocks autophagy (M. Chaumorcel, S. Souquere, G. Pierron, P. Codogno, and A. Esclatine, Autophagy 4:1-8, 2008) by a mechanism that requires de novo viral protein expression. Exploration of the mechanisms used by HCMV to block autophagy unveiled a robust increase of the cellular form of Bcl-2 expression. Although this protein has an anti-autophagy effect via its interaction with Beclin 1, it is not responsible for the inhibition induced by HCMV, probably because of its phosphorylation by c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Here we showed that the HCMV TRS1 protein blocks autophagosome biogenesis and that a TRS1 deletion mutant is defective in autophagy inhibition. TRS1 has previously been shown to neutralize the PKR antiviral effector molecule. Although phosphorylation of eIF2α by PKR has been described as a stimulatory signal to induce autophagy, the PKR-binding domain of TRS1 is dispensable to its inhibitory effect. Our results show that TRS1 interacts with Beclin 1 to inhibit autophagy. We mapped the interaction with Beclin 1 to the N-terminal region of TRS1, and we demonstrated that the Beclin 1-binding domain of TRS1 is essential to inhibit autophagy.","Chaumorcel, Magali; Lussignol, Marion; Mouna, Lina; Cavignac, Yolaine; Fahie, Kamau; Cotte-Laffitte, Jacqueline; Geballe, Adam; Brune, Wolfram; Beau, Isabelle; Codogno, Patrice; Esclatine, Audrey",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.05746-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22205736/,52

RECENT FINDINGS Previous reviews have indicated these programs are beneficial overall. Positive impacts were documented in school-based programs conducted by trained teachers and paraprofessionals with stronger effects achieved by more qualified professionals. The review found supporting evidence for positive impacts of post-disaster psychosocial programs. However, the strength of evidence is limited due to heterogeneity in interventions and evaluations. The stepped care model was found to be useful in differentiating between programs and level of available evidence. Hobfoll's five essential elements of mass trauma intervention provide an additional means of guiding program content and assessments, particularly for universal programs. Identified gaps in evidence included groups likely to be at most risk: preschool children, ethnically diverse groups, those with disability, and social disadvantage. There were promising indications of program benefits for groups with repeated exposure to natural disasters.","L, Gibbs; K, Marinkovic; J, Nursey; A, Tong L; E, Tekin; M, Ulubasoglu; N, Callard; S, Cowlishaw; E, Cobham V",Current psychiatry reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-021-01293-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34652557/,52

Rapid identification of the physiological races of Pgt are very importance for the prevention of wheat stem rust. In this paper we developed a molecular method to identify the most prevalent race of Pgt, as a supplement for traditionally used host-specific methods. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) was employed as a means of analyzing DNA polymorphisms in six common physiological races of Pgt in China and Ug99. In total, 64 pairs of primers were used for AFLP screening of race-specific molecular markers. One primer pair-namely, E7/M7 (5'-GACTGCGTACCAATTCG G-3'/5'-GATGAGTCCTGAGTAACGG-3')-yielded a unique band for the race 34MKG that was purified and cloned into the pGEM-T vector for sequencing. We then designed a new primer pairs (sequence-characterized amplified region marker) to amplify the 171-bp fragment and confirmed that the marker was highly specific for 34MKG. These results provide a new tool for monitoring different races of Pgt for improved control of wheat stem rust in China.","Chen, Si; Yang, Xue; Huang, Wen-Gong; Liu, Yan; Yu, Ying; Wu, Guang-Wen; Zhang, Shu-Quan; Li, Tian-Ya; Cao, Yuan-Yin",Molecular biology reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-020-05513-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418113/,52

OBJECTIVES The aim of this study is to explore risk factors of mortality and ICU admission in COVID-19 patients using combined CT and clinicolaboratory data. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed COVID-19 (N= 63) from University Hospitals in Tehran, Iran were studied. All patients underwent CT examination and a total CT score and the number of involved lung lobes were calculated and compared against collected laboratory and clinical information. Univariable and multivariate proportional hazards analysis were used to determine the relationship between the CT, laboratory and clinical data and ICU admission and in-hospital death. RESULTS By univariable analysis, in-hospital mortality was higher in patients with lower O2 saturation on admission (<88%), higher CT scores and higher number of lung lobes (> 4) involved with a diffuse parenchymal pattern. By multivariable analysis, in-hospital mortality was higher in patients with O2 saturation below 88% on admission and a higher number of lung lobes involved with diffuse parenchymal pattern. The risk of ICU admission was higher with comorbidities (hypertension and ischemic heart disease), SaO2 below 88% and pericardial effusion. CONCLUSIONS We can identify factors affecting in-hospital death and ICU admission in COVID-19. This can help to determine which patients are likely to require ICU admission and to help inform strategic health care planning in critical conditions such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sabri, Ali; Davarpanah, Amir H; Mahdavi, Arash; Abrishami, Alireza; Khazaei, Mehdi; Heydari, Saman; Asgari, Reyhane; Nekooghadam, Seyyed Mojtaba; Dobranowski, Julian; Taheri, Morteza Sanei",Polish archives of internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.20452/pamw.15422; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32500700/,52

DNA is built from charged electrons and atoms and has an inductor-like structure. This structure could be divided into linear, toroid and round inductors. Inductors interact with external electromagnetic waves, move and produce some extra waves within the cells. The shapes of these waves are similar to shapes of hexagonal and pentagonal bases of their DNA source. These waves produce some holes in liquids within the nucleus. To fill these holes, some extra hexagonal and pentagonal bases are produced. These bases could join to each other and form virus-like structures such as Coronavirus. To produce these viruses within a cell, it is necessary that the wavelength of external waves be shorter than the size of the cell. Thus 5G millimeter waves could be good candidates for applying in constructing virus-like structures such as Coronaviruses (COVID-19) within cells.","Fioranelli, M; Sepehri, A; Roccia, M G; Jafferany, M; Olisova, O Y; Lomonosov, K M; Lotti, T",Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,https://doi.org/10.23812/20-269-e-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32668870/,52

AIM To assess the effect on antibiotic prescribing in primary care of telehealth (TH) consultations compared to face-to-face (F2F). DESIGN & SETTING Systematic review and meta-analysis of adult or paediatric patients with a history of a community acquired acute infection (respiratory, urinary, or skin and soft tissue). We included studies that compared synchronous TH consultations (phone or video based) to F2F consultations in primary care. METHOD We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL (inception-2021), clinical trial registries and citing-cited references of included studies. Two review authors independently screened the studies and extracted the data. RESULTS We identified 13 studies. The one small randomised controlled trial found a non-significant 25% relative increase in antibiotic prescribing in the TH group. The remaining 10 were observational studies but did not control well for confounding, and therefore at high risk of bias. When pooled by specific infections, there was no consistent pattern. The six studies of sinusitis - including one before-after study - showed significantly less prescribing for acute rhinosinusitis in TH consultations, whereas the two studies of acute otitis media showed a significant increase. Pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, and urinary tract infections showed not-significant higher prescribing in the TH group. Bronchitis showed no change. CONCLUSIONS The impact of telehealth on prescribing appears to vary between conditions with more increases than reductions. However, there is insufficient evidence to draw strong conclusions, and higher quality research is urgently needed.","Bakhit, Mina; Baillie, Emma; Krzyzaniak, Natalia; van Driel, Mieke; Clark, Justin; Glasziou, Paul; Del Mar, Christopher",BJGP open,https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgpo.2021.0106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34497096/,52

The requirement for placement of the guiding catheter into the common carotid artery with assistance of an angiographic catheter, fluoroscopy time, contrast agent dose, and adverse events were recorded. RESULTS The fluoroscopy time was significantly longer and the contrast agent dose was significantly higher in patients with Type III than Type I and II arches. Significantly more patients with Type III than Type I and II arches required placement of the guiding catheter with assistance of an angiographic catheter (46.2% vs. 15.0%, respectively). The procedural success rate was significantly lower in patients with Type III than Type I and II arches (96.2% vs. 100.0%, respectively). The incidence of death, myocardial infarction, and all types of stroke was significantly higher in patients with Type III than Type I and II arches (7.7% vs. 1.7%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS The aortic arch type is an important influential factor in CAS.

The aims of this study were to evaluate the effectiveness and technical feasibility of lap PSD. STUDY DESIGN Between January 2011 and March 2016, we reviewed 13 patients who underwent laparoscopic approach among 22 patients who underwent PSD. PSD for the infra-ampullary lesions was defined as infra-ampullary duodenal resection including the first portion of the jejunum. After resection, all patients underwent reconstruction via side-to-side duodenojejunostomy. RESULTS The total mean operation time was 273 min (range 160-346 min), and estimated mean blood loss was 80 ml (range scanty-200 ml). One patient was converted to open laparotomy because of mesocolonic tumor involvement. The median postoperative hospital stay was 10.5 days (range 4-36 days). There were no postoperative mortalities. Postoperative complications included 2 instances of delayed gastric emptying (DGE), 1 duodenojejunostomy stricture, and 2 intestinal obstructions. No patient was treated with adjuvant therapy. One patient experienced hepatic metastasis 28 months after surgery during a mean follow-up period of 48.6 months. CONCLUSION Lap PSD might be an oncologically effective strategy for duodenal GIST, and the laparoscopic approach is a technically feasible and appealing surgical modality in terms of safety and perioperative results. However, DGE and anastomosis strictures are concerns for postoperative complications, which need to be further investigated.","Choi, Sung Hoon; Park, Jiae; Kang, Chang Moo; Lee, Woo Jung",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-018-4707-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29947989/,52

The North American Solitaire Stent Retriever Acute Stroke (NASA) registry aimed to assess the real world performance of the Solitaire FR device in contrast with the results from the SWIFT (Solitaire with the Intention for Thrombectomy) and TREVO 2 (Trevo versus Merci retrievers for thrombectomy revascularization of large vessel occlusions in acute ischemic stroke) trials. METHODS The investigator initiated NASA registry recruited North American sites to submit retrospective angiographic and clinical outcome data on consecutive acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients treated with the Solitaire FR between March 2012 and February 2013. The primary outcome was a Thrombolysis in Myocardial Ischemia (TIMI) score of ≥2 or a Treatment in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score of ≥2a. Secondary outcomes were 90 day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, mortality, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. RESULTS 354 patients underwent treatment for AIS using the Solitaire FR device in 24 centers. Mean time from onset to groin puncture was 363.4±239 min, mean fluoroscopy time was 32.9±25.7 min, and mean procedure time was 100.9±57.8 min. Recanalization outcome: TIMI ≥2 rate of 83.3% (315/354) and TICI ≥2a rate of 87.5% (310/354) compared with the operator reported TIMI ≥2 rate of 83% in SWIFT and TICI ≥2a rate of 85% in TREVO 2. Clinical outcome: 42% (132/315) of NASA patients demonstrated a 90 day mRS ≤2 compared with 37% (SWIFT) and 40% (TREVO 2). 90 day mortality was 30.2% (95/315) versus 17.2% (SWIFT) and 29% (TREVO 2). CONCLUSIONS The NASA registry demonstrated that the Solitaire FR device performance in clinical practice is comparable with the SWIFT and TREVO 2 trial results.","Zaidat, Osama O; Castonguay, Alicia C; Gupta, Rishi; Sun, Chung-Huan J; Martin, Coleman; Holloway, William E; Mueller-Kronast, Nils; English, Joey D; Linfante, Italo; Dabus, Guilherme; Malisch, Tim W; Marden, Franklin A; Bozorgchami, Hormozd; Xavier, Andrew; Rai, Ansaar T; Froehler, Michael T; Badruddin, Aamir; Nguyen, Thanh N; Taqi, M Asif; Abraham, Michael G; Janardhan, Vallabh; Shaltoni, Hashem; Novakovic, Roberta; Yoo, Albert J; Abou-Chebl, Alex; Chen, Peng R; Britz, Gavin W; Kaushal, Ritesh; Nanda, Ashish; Issa, Mohammad A; Nogueira, Raul G",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2013-010895.rep; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30037956/,52

This study investigated the association between single and multiple respiratory virus infections and risk of admission to a general ward, intensive care unit or death in patients aged 0-105 years (mean ± s.d. = 24·4 ± 24·1 years), from North West England, that were tested for respiratory virus infections between January 2007 and June 2012. The majority of infections were in children aged ⩽5 years. Dual or multiple infections occurred in 10·4% (1214/11 715) of patients, whereas single infection occurred in 89·6% (10 501/11 715). Rhinovirus was the most common co-infecting virus (occurring in 69·5%; 844/1214 of co-infections). In a multivariate logistic regression model, multiple infections were associated with an increased risk of admission to a general ward [odds ratio (OR) 1·43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1·2-1·7, P < 0·0001]. On the other hand, patients with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human parainfluenza virus types 1-3 (hPIV1-3), as a single infection, had a higher risk of being admitted to a general ward (OR 1·49, 95% CI 1·28-1·73, P < 0·0001 and OR 1·34, 95% CI 1·003-1·8, P = 0·05, respectively); admitted to an intensive-care unit or dying (OR 1·5, 95% CI 1·20-2·0, P = 0·001 and OR 1·60, 95% CI 1·02-2·40, P = 0·04, respectively).

METHODS We conducted a scoping literature review to search for English language articles published through July 15, 2019 to identify studies that reported the testing and/or evaluation of interventions to improve adherence to oral anti-neoplastic agents. RESULTS A total of 56 articles were selected for review. Of the studies evaluated, 14 were randomized trials. All interventions except two targeted adult patients. Thirty-three studies enrolled fewer than 100 patients. The majority of interventions were education and counseling-based and centered on provision of information about the drug and strategies to manage side effects. Only 8 studies used an mHealth tool and/or text messages to target non-adherence. Among studies with a comparison sample, fewer than half (44.7%) reported statistically significant improvements in adherence or persistence associated with the intervention; however, some pharmacist-directed programs, particularly those that integrated monitoring or routine follow-up with a provider, did demonstrate efficacy. CONCLUSION Although the development of adherence-promoting interventions for oral anti-neoplastic therapies has increased recently, few have been rigorously tested. The nascent literature suggests those that are pharmacist-directed and utilize regular monitoring show promise though additional prospective studies are needed. Study methodology, population selection, and potential challenges that may be encountered in the implementation and dissemination phases should be considered when developing new interventions to address non-adherence to oral anti-neoplastic treatment.","Rosenberg, Shoshana M; Petrie, Keith J; Stanton, Annette L; Ngo, Lan; Finnerty, Emma; Partridge, Ann H",Journal of the National Cancer Institute,https://doi.org/10.1093/jnci/djz244; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31899790/,52

One such approach for evaluating body water composition in various circumstances is bio-electrical impedance analysis (BIA). This study aims to appraise the usefulness of the Body Composition Monitor (BCM, Fresenius Medical Care, Germany) in assessing body fluid composition and intercompartmental shifts before and after open major abdominal surgery. This prospective, clinician blinded observational study enrolled all the patients scheduled consecutively for elective major open abdominal surgery during a 1-year period starting from January 1st, 2016. BIA parameters-total body water (TBW), extracellular water (ECW), intracellular water (ICW), absolute fluid overload (AFO), and relative fluid overload (RFO) were measured before and after surgery. The results were compared with fluid balance and outcome parameters such as organ dysfunction, ICU-and hospital length of stay (-LOS). The study population included 71 patients aged 60.2 ± 12 of whom 60.6% men and with a BMI of 26.3 ± 5.1 kg/m2. Postoperative acute kidney injury, respiratory dysfunction, and infections occurred in 14.0%, 19.7% and 28.1% of cases, respectively. The median LOS in ICU was 20 h and the hospital-LOS was 10 days. Positive intraoperative fluid balance (2.4 ± 1.0 L) resulted in a significant increase of TBW (1.4 ± 2.4 L) and of ECW (1.4 ± 1.2 L). Intraoperative fluid balance significantly correlated with TBW change (r = 0.23, p = 0.04) and with AFO change (r = 0.31, p < 0.01). A significant correlation was found between pre- and postoperative AFO and RFO on one hand, and ICU-LOS on the other.

Male Wistar rats (90-days-old) were treated once a day with conventional or organic white grape juice by gavage for 14 days (7 μL/g). On the 15th day the rats received carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) in a single dose of 3.0 mL/kg. Cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum were dissected to measure the activity of creatine kinase (CK) and pyruvate kinase (PK). No changes in feeding behavior were observed after the treatment with the grapes juices. However, there was an increase in grooming behavior in the open field test provoked by both juices. CCl4 inhibited CK activity in cerebral cortex and hippocampus of the rats and CCl4 also reduced PK activity in all brain structures studied. Furthermore, both white grape juices prevented the decrease in the activity of CK and PK. Therefore, we can suggest that organic and conventional white grape juices could restore the activity of enzymes with a central role in brain energy metabolism.","Gabardo, Tatiane; Peripolli, Clarice M; de Andrade, Rodrigo Binkowski; Gemelli, Tanise; Lima, Juliana D O; Oliveira, Alice S; da Silva Medeiros, Niara; Wannmacher, Clovis; Dani, Caroline; Funchal, Cláudia",Toxicology reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2015.03.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28962400/,52

This study aimed to estimate the ICS dose-response relationship for oral corticosteroid sparing effects in oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma, and to determine the proportion of oral corticosteroid sparing effect due to their systemic effects, based on the comparative dose-response relationship of ICS versus oral corticosteroids on adrenal suppression. METHODS Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials reporting oral corticosteroid sparing effects of high dose ICS in oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma. Reports of oral corticosteroid to ICS dose-equivalence in terms of adrenal suppression were additionally retrieved. The primary outcome was the proportion of the oral corticosteroid sparing effect of ICS that could be attributed to systemic absorption, per 1000 µg increase of ICS, expressed as a ratio. This ratio estimates the oral corticosteroid sparing effect of ICS due to systemic effects. RESULTS Eleven studies including 1283 participants reporting oral corticosteroid sparing effects of ICS were identified. The prednisone dose decrease per 1000 µg increase in ICS varied from 2.1 mg to 4.9 mg, depending on the type of ICS. The ratio of the prednisone sparing effect due to the systemic effects per 1000 µg of fluticasone propionate was 1.02 (95% CI 0.68-2.08) and for budesonide was 0.93 (95% CI 0.63-1.89). CONCLUSION In patients with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma, the limited available evidence suggests that the majority of the oral corticosteroid sparing effect of high dose ICS is likely to be due to systemic effects.","Maijers, Ingrid; Kearns, Nethmi; Harper, James; Weatherall, Mark; Beasley, Richard",The European respiratory journal,https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.01147-2019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31558659/,52

Infection at the surgical site where mesh is present poses a formidable clinical problem. METHODS The current surgical literature was reviewed to formulate accepted approaches to the management of hernia repairs with infected mesh. RESULTS Prevention of mesh infection is best achieved by judicious use of systemic antibiotics. Topical antibiotics often are used without convincing evidence to support their value. Laparoscopic repairs have lower infection rates than open repairs. Evidence is lacking to support lower rates of infection with mesh of specific composition or with antibacterial agents that coat the mesh. The diagnosis of mesh infection is principally a clinical one. Repairs of infected mesh usually necessitate antibiotics and removal of the foreign material. Clinical judgment is required for attempts at salvaging portions of the mesh. Component separation or biological materials may be used in those circumstances for hernia repair in which large defects are created by removal of the infected synthetic material. CONCLUSIONS Prevention of mesh infections remains the best strategy. Clinical judgment is essential in determining the degree of mesh removal. Continued clinical studies are necessary to improve the outcomes of established mesh infection in hernia repairs.,"Collage, Richard D; Rosengart, Matthew R",Surgical infections,https://doi.org/10.1089/sur.2010.029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20583867/,52

However, China still faces the risk of COVID-19 spreading due to not only to sporadic new cases and imported cases but also asymptomatic carriers. According to daily reports from the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China from March 31, 2020 to April 7, 2020, the number of new asymptomatic cases reported daily greatly exceeded that of new imported cases. As of 24:00 on April 7, there were a total of 1,095 asymptomatic cases with COVID-19 under medical observation on the Chinese mainland, including 358 imported cases. A growing number of studies have indicated that asymptomatic carriers are infectious to an extent and can potentially transmit COVID-19. At present, China's measures for managing asymptomatic carriers are 14 days of centralized quarantine and observation; in principle, people with two consecutive negative nucleic acid tests (at an interval of at least 24 hours) can be released from quarantine. However, asymptomatic carriers will not be included in confirmed cases unless they develop clinical manifestations while in quarantine. As ""silent spreaders"", asymptomatic carriers warrant attention as part of disease prevention and control.

84188,Therapeutic targeting in the silent era: advances in non-viral siRNA delivery.,2010,"BACKGROUND Salvage surgery after transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) has shown mixed results. Transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) might be advantageous in this population. The aim of this study was to assess the short-term oncologic and operative outcomes of salvage surgery after TEM, comparing TaTME to conventional salavge TME (sTME). METHODS Consecutive patients treated with salvage surgery after TEM were identified. Patients who underwent TaTME were compared to those who had conventional sTME. The primary outcome was the ability to perform an appropriate oncologic procedure defined by a composite outcome (negative distal margins, negative radial margins and complete or near complete mesorectum specimen). RESULTS During the study period, 41 patients had salvage surgery after TEM. Of those, 11 patients had TaTME while 30 patients had sTME. All patients in the TaTME group met the composite outcome of appropriate oncologic procedure compared to 76.7% for the conventional sTME group (p = 0.19). TaTME was associated with significantly higher rates of sphincter preservation (100 vs. 50%, p = 0.01), higher rates of laparoscopic surgery (100 vs. 23.3%, p < 0.001) and lower rates of conversion to open surgery (9.1 vs. 57%, p < 0.001). No difference was found in postoperative morbidity (36.3 vs. 36.7%, p = 0.77). CONCLUSIONS The present study demonstrates that for patients requiring salvage surgery after TEM, TaTME is associated with significantly higher rates of sphincter-sparing surgery when compared to conventional transabdominal TME while producing adequate short-term oncologic outcomes. Salvage surgery after TEM might be a clear indication for TaTME rather than conventional surgery.","Letarte, F; Raval, M; Karimuddin, A; Phang, P T; Brown, C J",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-018-1784-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29725785/,52

Many countries rapidly deployed physical-distancing mandates to curb the spread of the virus; others did not. Social distancing strategies are necessary to reduce the transmission of the virus but there may be unintended consequences. We examined psychological distress in four societies with distinct public health strategies (South Korea, Hong Kong, France and the United States) to identify common and region-specific factors that may contribute to mental health outcome during the pandemic. From March to July of 2020, a survey of demographics, general health, mental health, loneliness and social networks was conducted. Overall, younger age, greater concern for COVID, and more severe loneliness predicted worse psychological outcome but the magnitudes of these effects varied across the four regions. Objective measures of social isolation did not affect mental health. There were also notable differences in psychological outcome; Hong Kong, with very strict social distancing protocols plus ongoing political unrest, suffered the most drastic deterioration of mental health. To prepare for an impending mental health crisis, concerted efforts to reduce loneliness should be integrated into a comprehensive public health strategy.","Dean, Derek J; Tso, Ivy F; Giersch, Anne; Lee, Hyeon-Seung; Baxter, Tatiana; Griffith, Taylor; Song, Lijun; Park, Sohee",Psychiatry research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113593; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33276269/,52

We optimized the annealing temperature and primer concentrations for the CCoV nanoPCR assay and assessed its sensitivity and specificity. Under optimized nanoPCR reaction conditions, the detection limits were 6.47 × 101 copies/μL for CCoV I and 6.91 × 102 copies/μL for CCoV II. No fragments were amplified using other canine viruses as templates. The sensitivity of the nanoPCR assay was 100-fold higher than that of a conventional RT-PCR assay. Among 60 clinical samples collected from Beijing, China, the assay detected 12% positive for CCoV I and 48% positive for CCoV II.

However, there are no effective drugs for most of these severe viral infections. Passive immunotherapy with convalescent plasma or hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin (H-IVIG) is a potential therapeutic option for serious viral infections. It is important to find a suitable source of convalescent plasma and of H-IVIG containing high titer neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). METHODS Sera from 96 healthy adult donors in southern China and commercially available IVIG were analyzed for the titers of NAb to several most common respiratory viruses including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), seasonal influenza A (InfA), enterovirus 71 (EV71), coxsackievirus A16 (CA16), adenovirus type 3 (Ad3) and a recent epidemic adenovirus type 55 (Ad55) by microneutralization test. RESULTS A high proportion of samples from healthy adult donors were positive for NAbs (>16) to all the viruses except Ad55. A different proportion of these samples had high NAb titers (>512) for InfA (25%), Ad3 (17.71%), RSV (9.38%), EV71 (1.04%), CA16 (3.13%), and Ad55 (4.17%). Commercially available IVIG had high NAb titers to InfA and Ad3 (>1,000) and lower NAb titers to RSV [320], EV71 [160], and CA16 [160]. Strikingly, IVIG also had a high NAb titer to Ad55 (>1,000). CONCLUSIONS Convalescent plasma could be screened from healthy blood volunteers to establish blood banks and to prepare specific H-IVIG for treating severe ARIs caused by common respiratory viruses.","Tian, Xingui; Jiang, Zaixue; Ma, Qiang; Liu, Qian; Lu, Xiaomei; Liu, Wenkuan; Liao, Xiaohong; Zhou, Rong; Su, Xiaobo; Luo, Qingming",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd.2016.03.29; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27162653/,52

PURPOSE To examine the effects of intensive BP-lowering treatment on OH in hypertensive adults. (PROSPERO: CRD42020153753). DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL from inception through 7 October 2019, without language restrictions. STUDY SELECTION Randomized trials of BP pharmacologic treatment (more intensive BP goal or active agent) that involved more than 500 adults with hypertension or elevated BP and that were 6 months or longer in duration. Trial comparisons were groups assigned to either less intensive BP goals or placebo, and the outcome was measured OH, defined as a decrease of 20 mm Hg or more in systolic BP or 10 mm Hg or more in diastolic BP after changing position from seated to standing. DATA EXTRACTION Two investigators independently abstracted articles and rated risk of bias. DATA SYNTHESIS Five trials examined BP treatment goals, and 4 examined active agents versus placebo. Trials examining BP treatment goals included 18 466 participants with 127 882 follow-up visits. Trials were open-label, with minimal heterogeneity of effects across trials. Intensive BP treatment lowered risk for OH (odds ratio, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.86 to 0.99]). Effects did not differ by prerandomization OH (P for interaction = 0.80). In sensitivity analyses that included 4 additional placebo-controlled trials, overall and subgroup findings were unchanged. LIMITATIONS Assessments of OH were done while participants were seated (not supine) and did not include the first minute after standing. Data on falls and syncope were not available. CONCLUSION Intensive BP-lowering treatment decreases risk for OH. Orthostatic hypotension, before or in the setting of more intensive BP treatment, should not be viewed as a reason to avoid or de-escalate treatment for hypertension.

Because of this, there has been an increased interest in knotless flexor tendon repair using barbed suture. Since knots are not required, it may be possible to increase the strength of the tendon repair by using a large-diameter barbed suture. The purpose of this study was to biomechanically compare a traditional four-strand tendon repair using 3-0 braided polyester with a similar knotless four-strand tendon repair using 0 unidirectional barbed suture. METHODS Twenty-two matched cadaveric flexor digitorum profundus tendons were lacerated and assigned to repair by a four-strand modified Kirchmayr-Kessler technique using 3-0 braided polyester (n = 11) or knotless four-strand modified Kirchmayr-Kessler repair using 0 unidirectional barbed suture (n = 11). Repaired tendons were linearly distracted to failure at 20 mm/min after 1 N preload. Maximum load and load at 2-mm gap formation were recorded. Maximum load and load at 2-mm gap formation were compared with the Student's t test, and p values ≤ 0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS The mean maximum load of the barbed, knotless suture repair was higher than that of the traditional repair (52 vs. 42 N). There was no difference between the two groups in the mean load required to produce a 2-mm gap. CONCLUSIONS The four-strand knotless tendon repairs using a large-diameter unidirectional barbed suture were stronger than the traditional four-strand repairs using 3-0 braided polyester, and had similar 2-mm gap resistance.","Lin, Toni E; Lakhiani, Chrisovalantis; Lee, Michael R; Saint-Cyr, Michel; Sammer, Douglas M",Hand,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11552-012-9491-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24426940/,52
87073,NKp46 expression discriminates porcine NK cells with different functional properties.,2012,"Protein therapeutics represent a significant and growing component of the modern pharmacopeia, but their potential to treat human disease is limited because most proteins fail to traffic across biological membranes. Recently, we discovered a class of cell-permeant miniature proteins (CPMPs) containing a precisely defined, penta-arginine (penta-Arg) motif that traffics readily to the cytosol and nucleus of mammalian cells with efficiencies that rival those of hydrocarbon-stapled peptides active in animals and man. Like many cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), CPMPs enter the endocytic pathway; the difference is that CPMPs containing a penta-Arg motif are released efficiently from endosomes, while other CPPs are not. Here, we seek to understand how CPMPs traffic from endosomes into the cytosol and what factors contribute to the efficiency of endosomal release. First, using two complementary cell-based assays, we exclude endosomal rupture as the primary means of endosomal escape. Next, using an RNA interference screen, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, and confocal imaging, we identify VPS39-a gene encoding a subunit of the homotypic fusion and protein-sorting (HOPS) complex-as a critical determinant in the trafficking of CPMPs and hydrocarbon-stapled peptides to the cytosol. Although CPMPs neither inhibit nor activate HOPS function, HOPS activity is essential to efficiently deliver CPMPs to the cytosol. CPMPs localize within the lumen of Rab7+ and Lamp1+ endosomes and their transport requires HOPS activity. Overall, our results identify Lamp1+ late endosomes and lysosomes as portals for passing proteins into the cytosol and suggest that this environment is prerequisite for endosomal escape.","Steinauer, Angela; LaRochelle, Jonathan R; Knox, Susan L; Wissner, Rebecca F; Berry, Samuel; Schepartz, Alanna",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1812044116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30610181/,52
87979,Enhancing the antioxidant activity of technical lignins by combining solvent fractionation and ionic liquid treatment.,2019,"Introduction of synthetic mesh was a landmark breakthrough in the management of hernia repair and has significantly reduced recurrence rates. But in addition to the benefits, some more problems have come in picture major being 'mesh infection'. Prolene mesh has shown promise when used in abdominal and inguinal hernia repair, especially when used in planned surgeries. This material, derived from monofilament polypropelene, is found to be biologically inert in almost every person. Being a foreign material, a slightest breach in asepsis can lead to favourable environment for bacterial proliferation and form a 'biofilm'. This phenomenon especially after laparoscopic surgeries gives rise to chronic discharging sinus at the port site, abscess formation around mesh and even sepsis. It appears that laparoscopic hernia repair is a promising method but having chances of mesh infection owing to difficult approach and lack of uniformity in sterilization of laparoscopic instruments. Slightest breach in sterility or protocols might lead to such a large ventral wall sinus, increasing morbidity and cost of treatment. Treatment of infected mesh is possible by local debridement, irrigation, mesh removal and systemic antibiotics culminating in increased morbidity over duration of disease, but still it would be worth emphasizing-'Prevention is better than cure'.","Narkhede, Rajvilas; Shah, N M; Dalal, P R; Mangukia, Chirantan; Dholaria, Shreyas",The Indian journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12262-015-1304-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26702240/,52

Methods In this prospective study, 21 healthy male horses underwent celiotomy. Skin closure was either performed via a continuous percutaneous pattern (CO group; 5 warmbloods/5 ponies) or an intradermal pattern (ID group; 5 warmbloods/6 ponies). Follow-up examination of the incisional site included daily monitoring for edema, dehiscence, and drainage. Transcutaneous ultrasound was performed at Days 3, 6, and 10 as well as on Week 8 and 12 to evaluate size of edema and presence or absence of sinus formation, and hernia formation. Prevalence of incisional infection on base of positive microbiological analysis at any time up to Day 10 was evaluated and compared between ID and CO group. Furthermore, edema size was analysed by a linear mixed-effect model for group and time dependency. Results Observed incisional complications included edema (9/10 in CO, 10/11 in ID), suture sinus formation (2/10 in CO, 1/11 in ID), surgical site infection (2/10 in CO, 0/11 in ID), and incisional hernia (1/10 in CO, 0/11 in ID). The overall prevalence of incisional infection was 9.5% without significant differences between both groups (20% in CO, 0% in ID; p = 0.214). Edema size was not dependent on time or group (p = 0.545 and p = 0.627, respectively). Discussion CO and ID suture pattern are appropriate for skin closure following ventral median celiotomy in horses. None of the animals in the continuous ID group developed surgical site infections, even without the use of antibiotics.","Scharner, Doreen; Gittel, Claudia; Winter, Karsten; Blaue, Dominique; Schedlbauer, Carola; Vervuert, Ingrid; Brehm, Walter",PeerJ,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.5772; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30430040/,52

OBJECTIVES In this study, we report on postoperative complications associated with LCA and PCA in a single tertiary center experience. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We conducted a retrospective review of electronic medical records for patients undergoing LCA or PCA between 2001 and 2008 at our institution. INTERVENTIONS All patients underwent LCA or PCA. MEASUREMENTS Demographics, radiographic variables, and complication rates were compared between the two groups. Complications were classified according to the modified Clavien system. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Of a total of 195 patients included in this study, 72 underwent LCA and 123 underwent PCA. There were no differences in demographics between the groups. We observed complications in 10 LCA procedures (13.9%) and 26 PCA procedures (21.1%) (p=0.253). The distribution of the complications differed significantly between the groups with mild complications (grades 1 and 2) more common in the PCA group (20.3% vs 5.6%, respectively; p=0.001), whereas severe events (grades 3 and 4) were more frequent in the LCA group (8.3% vs 0.8%, respectively; p=0.011). On multivariate analysis, age and body mass index were inversely associated with complications, whereas female gender, multiple tumors, and preexisting comorbidities showed a trend toward increased risk. CONCLUSIONS LCA and PCA, although minimally invasive, are not void of complications. Most of the complications encountered are mild; however, severe (grade 3 or 4) events may occur in up to 3.6% of patients. PCA may be associated with a higher rate of complications, although most of these are mild and transient. However, on multivariate analysis, the chosen ablative approach (laparoscopic or percutaneous) is not associated with the risk of complications.","Tsivian, Matvey; Chen, Valerie H; Kim, Charles Y; Zilberman, Dorit E; Mouraviev, Vladimir; Nelson, Rendon C; Albala, David M; Polascik, Thomas J",European urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2010.03.035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20363550/,52

The selected model corresponds to the point in the confidence region of the parameters that minimizes the penalty, making it the least complex model that still has acceptable fit according to the test that defines the confidence region. As the globaltest is particularly powerful in the presence of many weak predictors, it connects well to ridge regression, and we thus focus on ridge penalties in this paper. The confidence region method is quick to calculate, intuitive, and gives decent predictive potential. As a tuning parameter selection method it may even outperform classical methods such as cross-validation in terms of mean squared error of prediction, especially when the signal is weak. We illustrate the method for linear models in simulation study and for Cox models in real gene expression data of breast cancer samples.","Xu, Ningning; Solari, Aldo; Goeman, Jelle",Biometrical journal.

88667,A robust ferroptosis-related gene signature predicts overall survival in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.,2021-08-09,"The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the available evidence regarding the acute effects of interrupting/breaking up prolonged sedentary behavior (SB) on vascular health among individuals at elevated risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Searches of MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were conducted on April 7, 2020. Included studies: (1) examined the effect of breaking up prolonged SB in adults with or at elevated risk for T2D and (2) assessed a vascular health outcome, such as blood pressure (BP), flow-mediated dilation (FMD), pulse-wave velocity, or endothelin-1. A total of 20 articles (17 unique studies) were included. Only three studies reported adequate statistical power for the specified vascular outcome. The available evidence suggests that light and moderate intensity activity breaks are effective in acutely lowering BP when compared to prolonged sitting. The small number of studies that included FMD or other vascular outcomes prohibits conclusions regarding the impact of SB breaks on these outcomes. Few studies evaluating the impact of breaking up SB among adults at risk for T2D have included and been adequately powered to examine vascular outcomes, but our preliminary finding, that certain SB breaks improve BP, provides proof-of-concept for this line of inquiry. Future studies should examine both the acute and chronic vascular effects of breaking up SB among individuals most vulnerable to the effects of SB (e.g. older adults, those with T2D), as these individuals are both highly sedentary and at greatest risk of poor health outcomes.

However, development of treatment failure and drug resistance raises concern over lifelong treatments to chronic diseases such as HIV/AIDS. Objectives This study determined proportion of treatment failure (TF) and identified factors associated with TF among people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Bahir Dar, Northwest Ethiopia. Methods Facility based cross sectional study was carried out from November, 2017 to April, 2018. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected using structured questioner. Blood sample was collected and analyzed for viral load, complete blood count (CBC), liver and kidney function test and CD4 count. A patient is declared as treatment failure when viral load value is higher than 1000 RNA copies/ml in two consecutive viral load analyses within three months interval. Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 23. To identify factors associated with TF, logistic regressions model was employed. Results A total of 430 people who had six months and above antiretroviral treatment (ART) follow up were enrolled in the study. Of these, 57.9% were females & the mean age was 38 years. The mean month of ART follow up was 83 months. In the first viral load analysis, 106 (24.7%) of the cohort were virologically failed. These failed people were followed for 3 months with intensive adherence support; then second viral load analysis showed a viralogical failure among 65 people of the second cohort. Thus, the overall viralogical failure or TF was 15.1%. The re-suppression rates were 41(38.7%). Male gender, people with history of drug discontinuation, poor adherence, irregular time of drug intake, multiple sexual practice showed significant association with TF. Moreover, base line and current CD4 counts of <200 cells/ml also demonstrated significant association with TF. Conclusion Significant proportion of treatment failure was reported in the present study. Moreover, behavioral factors such as drug discontinuation, poor adherence, multiple sexual partner were associated with treatment failure. Hence, to avoid TF, regular patient counseling and monitoring should be in place. To identify the predictors for treatment failure, further follow-up study is desirable.","Genet, Andualem; Mekonnen, Zewdie; Yizengaw, Endalew; Mekonnen, Daniel",African health sciences,https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v21i1.34; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394306/,52

This perspecitve may be especially important to study among adolescents, who are less likely to experience severe symptoms but contribute to the spread of the virus. Objective To examine psychological factors associated with adolescents' behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants This self-reported survey conducted from March 20 to 22, 2020, recruited a population-based sample of adolescents via social media to complete an anonymous survey. Participants were eligible if they had internet access, lived in the United States, and were aged 13 to 18 years. Main Outcomes and Measures Outcomes included COVID-19 news monitoring, social distancing, disinfecting, and hoarding behaviors during the 7 days after the United States declared a national emergency. The psychological factors were attitudes about COVID-19 severity, social responsibility values, social trust, and self-interest. The a priori hypotheses were that greater attitudes about the severity of COVID-19, greater social responsibility, and greater social trust would be associated with greater news monitoring, social distancing, and disinfecting, whereas greater self-interest would be associated with more hoarding. Results The sample included 770 adolescents collected via convenience sampling (mean [SD] age, 16.3 [1.1] years; 575 girls [74.7%]). Many teens reported not engaging in pure social distancing (528 [68.6%]), but they were monitoring the news (688 [89.4%]) and disinfecting daily (676 [87.8%]). Some teens reported hoarding (152 [19.7%]). Attitudes about the greater severity of COVID-19 were associated with more social distancing (β = 0.18; 95% CI = 0.10 to 0.25), disinfecting (β = 0.16; 95% CI = 0.08 to 0.23), and news monitoring (β = 0.26; 95% CI = 0.18 to 0.33) but also more hoarding (β = 0.08; 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.16). Greater social responsibility was associated with more disinfecting (β = 0.24; 95% CI = 0.17 to 0.32) and news monitoring (β = 0.14; 95% CI = 0.07 to 0.22) and less hoarding (β = -0.07; 95% CI = -0.14 to -0.01). Greater self-interest values were associated with less social distancing (β = -0.08; 95% CI = -0.15 to -0.01) and more hoarding (β = 0.08; 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.15). Greater social trust was associated with less hoarding (β = -0.09; 95% CI, -0.16 to -0.02). Conclusions and Relevance The results of this survey study suggest that emphasizing the severity of COVID-19 and the social implications of pandemic-related behaviors may be important for teens, particularly for those who are not following preventive health behaviors or who are engaging in hoarding.","Oosterhoff, Benjamin; Palmer, Cara A",JAMA pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2020.1876; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32597925/,52

Wolfgang Wodarg and Micheal Yeadon petitioned to withhold emergency use authorization of the BNT162b2 messenger ribonucleic acid vaccine for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manufactured by BioNTech and Pfizer, raising concern for female infertility risks but acknowledging the lack of evidence. The European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration ultimately issued emergency use authorizations, but misinformation claiming that COVID-19 vaccines cause female infertility began circulating on social media, potentially influencing public perception and medical decision making among pregnant patients or those seeking to become pregnant. OBJECTIVES To determine the potential influence misinformation may have had on public interest in infertility related topics, as analyzed through internet search statistics in the US. METHODS The Google Trends tool was used to analyze results for the search terms ""infertility,"" ""infertility AND vaccine,"" and ""infertility AND COVID vaccine"" in the US from February 4, 2020 to February 3, 2021. We applied autoregressive integrated moving average models to forecast expected values, comparing them with actual observed values. RESULTS At peak interest (100), the forecasted relative search volumes interest for the search terms ""infertility,"" ""infertility AND vaccine,"" and ""infertility AND COVID vaccine"" were 45.47 (95% CI, 33.27-57.66; p<0.001), 0.88 (95% CI, 2.87-4.63; p<0.001), and 0.29 (95% CI, -2.25-2.82; p<0.001). The actual relative search volumes at peak searching represented 119.9, 11,251, and 34,900% increases, respectively, when compared with forecasted values. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 vaccine misinformation corresponded with increased internet searches for topics related to infertility in the US. Dispelling misinformation and informing patients about the risks and benefits of COVID-19 vaccination may prevent unnecessary vaccine hesitancy or refusal, contributing to successful vaccination efforts.","Sajjadi, Nicholas B; Nowlin, William; Nowlin, Ross; Wenger, David; Beal, John Martin; Vassar, Matt; Hartwell, Micah",Journal of osteopathic medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/jom-2021-0059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33838086/,52

Rapid transmission of COVID-19 has caused wide-spread panic. Many established medications have been used to treat the disease symptoms; however, no specific drugs or vaccines have been developed. Organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) may serve as suitable infection models for ex vivo mimicking of the viral life cycle and drug screening. Human iPSC-3D organoids, self-organised tissues with multiple cell environments, have a similar structure and function as real human organs; hence, these organoids allow greater viral infection efficiency, mimic the natural host-virus interactions, and are suitable for long-term experimentation. Here, we suggest the use of a functional human iPSC-organoid that could act as a reliable and feasible ex vivo infection model for investigation of the virus. This approach will provide much needed insight into the underlying molecular dynamics of COVID-19 for the development of novel treatment and prevention strategies.","Zhou, Hang; Liu, Li-Ping; Fang, Mei; Li, Yu-Mei; Zheng, Yun-Wen",Histology and histopathology,https://doi.org/10.14670/hh-18-223; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32339250/,52

Parenteral unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, and fondaparinux are available for VTE prophylaxis. Vitamin K antagonists, the only available oral anticoagulants, are widely used in the United States for thromboprophylaxis in joint replacement surgery in spite of being associated with several disadvantages, limiting their effectiveness in the postoperative setting. The oral direct thrombin inhibitor ximelagatran, briefly approved outside the United States for thromboprophylaxis in orthopedic patients, was discontinued due to severe hepatotoxicity concerns. Recently, the oral factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban have entered late phase development for VTE thromboprophylaxis and treatment and the oral direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran has received marketing approval from the European Medicines Agency. METHODS Review of clinical studies of the oral anticoagulants in VTE prevention in orthopedic surgery and comparison with large observational registries. RESULTS : Results from Phase II/III studies suggest that new oral anticoagulants may provide an efficacious alternative in VTE prevention in orthopedic surgery. Furthermore, these new oral agents have, so far, shown a good overall safety profile, with no evidence of increased hepatotoxicity. However, comparison with large observational registries reveals differences between real-life patient populations, which make extrapolation of clinical trial data to actual clinical practice difficult. Differences in endpoint definitions also prevent indirect comparison of agents. Specific compliance and postmarketing safety issues (especially liver enzyme monitoring requirements) need to be clarified before these agents are widely accepted into routine clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS Although new oral anticoagulants appear promising, clinical trial results should be viewed with caution until they can be replicated in routine care settings across a broad spectrum of surgical patients.","Merli, Geno; Spyropoulos, Alex C; Caprini, Joseph A",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0b013e3181ae6dbe; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19638915/,52

Aims: We investigated the potential impacts of epidemics on suicide-related outcomes. Method: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, PsyArXiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv from inception to May 13-16, 2020. Inclusion criteria: primary studies, reviews, and meta-analyses; reporting the impact of epidemics; with a primary outcome of suicide, suicidal behavior, suicidal ideation, and/or self-harm. Exclusion criteria: not concerned with suicide-related outcomes; not suitable for data extraction. PROSPERO registration: #CRD42020187013. Results: Eight primary papers were included, examining the effects of five epidemics on suicide-related outcomes. There was evidence of increased suicide rates among older adults during SARS and in the year following the epidemic (possibly motivated by social disconnectedness, fears of virus infection, and concern about burdening others) and associations between SARS/Ebola exposure and increased suicide attempts. A preprint study reported associations between COVID-19 distress and past-month suicidal ideation. Limitations: Few studies have investigated the topic; these are of relatively low methodological quality. Conclusion: Findings support an association between previous epidemics and increased risk of suicide-related outcomes. Research is needed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on suicide outcomes.","Zortea, Tiago C; Brenna, Connor T A; Joyce, Mary; McClelland, Heather; Tippett, Marisa; Tran, Maxwell M; Arensman, Ella; Corcoran, Paul; Hatcher, Simon; Heise, Marnin J; Links, Paul; O'Connor, Rory C; Edgar, Nicole E; Cha, Yevin; Guaiana, Giuseppe; Williamson, Eileen; Sinyor, Mark; Platt, Stephen",Crisis,https://doi.org/10.1027/0227-5910/a000753; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33063542/,52
95981,"Inactivated virus vaccines from chemistry to prophylaxis: merits, risks and challenges.",2012,"Macrophage dysfunction is fundamentally related to altered immunity in cystic fibrosis (CF). How genetic deficits in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) lead to these defects remains unknown. Rapid advances in genomic editing such as the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system provide new tools for scientific study. We aimed to create a stable CFTR knockout (KO) in human macrophages in order to study how CFTR regulates macrophage function. Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from non-CF healthy volunteers and differentiated into monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). MDMs were transfected with a CRISPR Cas9 CFTR KO plasmid. CFTR KO efficiency was verified and macrophage halide efflux, phagocytosis, oxidative burst, apoptosis, and cytokine functional assays were performed. CFTR KO in human MDMs was efficient and stable after puromycin selection. CFTR KO was confirmed by CFTR mRNA and protein expression. CFTR function was abolished in CFTR KO MDMs. CFTR KO recapitulated known defects in human CF MDM (CFTR class I/II variants) dysfunction including (1) increased apoptosis, (2) decreased phagocytosis, (3) reduced oxidative burst, and (4) increased bacterial load. Activation of the oxidative burst via nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase assembly was diminished in CFTR KO MDMs (decreased phosphorylated p47phox). Cytokine production was unchanged or decreased in response to infection in CFTR KO MDMs. In conclusion, we developed a primary human macrophage CFTR KO system. CFTR KO mimics most pathology observed in macrophages obtained from persons with CF, which suggests that many aspects of CF macrophage dysfunction are CFTR-dependent and not just reflective of the CF inflammatory milieu.","Zhang, Shuzhong; Shrestha, Chandra L; Wisniewski, Benjamin L; Pham, Hanh; Hou, Xucheng; Li, Wenqing; Dong, Yizhou; Kopp, Benjamin T",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01871; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32973772/,52

Methods CGF was prepared from venous blood of healthy volunteers, and then CGF extracts (CGFe) were prepared. In vitro experiment: human BMSCs (hBMSCs) were divided into 4 groups. Groups A, B, and C were cultured with α-MEM medium [containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% double antibody] containing 2%, 5%, and 10%CGFe, respectively; group D was cultured with α-MEM medium (containing 10%FBS and 1% double antibody) without CGFe. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the effect of CGFe on cell adhesion. Cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) was used to detect the effect of CGFe on cell proliferation. After osteogenic induction, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was detected and Western blot was performed to detect osteopontin (OPN) expression. In vivo experiment: Eighteen New Zealand big-eared rabbits were used to prepare circular bone defect models on the left and right mandibles, and implant CGF gel (prepared from autologous venous blood)+MC material (volume ratio 1∶1, experimental group) and simple MC material (control group), respectively. At 4, 8, and 12 weeks after operation, 6 rabbits were sacrificed respectively to obtain materials, and Micro-CT scanning was performed to observe the formation of new bone and material degradation in vivo. Results In vitro experiments: Scanning electron microscopy showed that the cells of groups A, B, and C spread better on MC materials than group D, with more pseudopodia. CCK-8 method showed that different concentrations of CGFe could promote cell proliferation, and the absorbance ( A) value of cells cultured for 2, 3, 5, and 7 days was in the order of group C>group B>group A>group D, the differences were significant ( P<0.05). ALP activity test showed that its activity was proportional to the osteogenic induction time and CGFe concentration ( P<0.05). Western blot analysis of osteogenic induction culture for 14 days showed that the relative expression of OPN protein in groups A, B, and C was significantly higher than that in group D, and the higher the CGFe concentration, the higher the relative expression of OPN protein ( P<0.05). In vivo experiment: Micro-CT observation showed that the new bone formation and material degradation of the experimental group were better than those of the control group at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after operation. Quantitative detection showed that the volume of new bone volume, new bone volume fraction, trabeculae number, and trabecular thickness of the experimental group were significantly higher than those of the control group at each time point, the residual material volume, residual material volume fraction, and trabecular separation were significantly lower than those of the control group, all showing significant differences ( P<0.05). Conclusion CGF can effectively promote the adhesion, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs on MC materials, and 10%CGFe has the most significant effect. The combined application of CGF and MC material can significantly promote bone formation in vivo.","Zhang, Yue; Liu, Keda; Yan, Ming; Wang, Wei",Zhongguo xiu fu chong jian wai ke za zhi = Zhongguo xiufu chongjian waike zazhi = Chinese journal of reparative and reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.7507/1002-1892.202009070; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33719236/,52

To that end, primary prevention is far better than managing subsequent organ damage. When medication is needed to prevent or manage disease, the preferred choice should be associated with the greatest benefits and fewest adverse effects. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in postmenopausal women worldwide. Considering disease-adjusted life years, other leading causes are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, dementias, hearing loss, cancers of the breast, lung and bowel, osteoporosis, fractures and falls, depression, osteoarthritis, refractive errors of the eye and non-diabetic chronic kidney disease. This review explores the global prevalence of these diseases in women aged 50 years and older, and medications commonly used for them, and contrasts the effects of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) with others. When initiated early, there is good evidence for MHT benefit in all-cause mortality and primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and osteoporosis; fair evidence for benefit in dementias, depression and osteoarthritis; limited evidence for benefit in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hearing loss, non-diabetic chronic kidney disease and colorectal cancer; null effects on lung cancer and refractive errors; and varied effects on breast cancer and stroke. Relative benefits and adverse effects of other medications warrant consideration.","Langer, R D",Climacteric : the journal of the International Menopause Society,https://doi.org/10.1080/13697137.2021.1911991; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33977831/,52

We performed a systematic review of the literature using the MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. Random-effects meta-analysis was carried out to compare the overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) of patients with resectable HCC undergoing hepatectomy followed by adjuvant TACE vs. hepatectomy alone in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The risk of bias was assessed using the Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. Meta-regression analyses were performed to explore the effect of hepatitis B viral status, microvascular invasion, type of resection (anatomic vs. parenchymal-sparing), and tumor size on the outcomes. Ten eligible RCTs, reporting on 1216 patients in total, were identified. The combination of hepatectomy and adjuvant TACE was associated with superior OS (hazard ratio (HR): 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.52 to 0.85; p < 0.001) and RFS (HR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.56 to 0.88; p < 0.001) compared to hepatectomy alone. There were significant concerns regarding the risk of bias in most of the included studies. Overall, adjuvant TACE may be associated with an oncologic benefit in select HCC patients. However, the applicability of these findings may be limited to Eastern Asian populations, due to the geographically restricted sample. High-quality multinational RCTs, as well as predictive tools to optimize patient selection, are necessary before adjuvant TACE can be routinely implemented into standard practice.

The objective of this study is to compare classic transumbilical LESS nephrectomy with needlescopic-assisted laparoscopy (NAL) surgery. In doing so, we evaluated whether the addition of a single 2-mm subcostal port could restore triangulation while not jeopardizing recovery or cosmetic outcome in the porcine model. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ten female farm pigs were randomized to laparoscopic nephrectomy with either LESS or NAL. In LESS, a TriPort was placed through a single 2.5-cm umbilical incision. In NAL, 5- and 10-mm ports were placed in the umbilicus and a 2-mm port was placed in the midclavicular line. Preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative parameters were compared. Variables were analyzed with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and two-tailed Fisher exact test. Cosmesis was evaluated objectively using the Vancouver Scar Scale and subjectively by a blinded dermatologist. A cost analysis was performed. RESULTS Estimated blood loss was minimal in both groups (28.8 mL in LESS and 9.4 mL in NAL). Operative time was significantly shorter in NAL (103 vs 150 min; P<0.001). There was no difference in complications (2 vs 1; P=0.500), objective cosmesis (3.9 vs 3.8; P>0.2), or subjective cosmesis (2 vs 3; P=0.500). The NAL protocol had significantly lower disposable equipment costs ($363 vs $1696). CONCLUSIONS The addition of a 2-mm subcostal port and the restoration of triangulation in the NAL protocol enable shorter operative times, increased surgeon comfort, improved technical ease, and lower costs while maintaining the scarless cosmesis of the traditional LESS protocol.","Nicolay, Lesli I; Bowman, Ryan J; Heldt, Jonathan P; Jellison, Forrest C; Mehr, Neda; Tenggardjaja, Christopher; Millard, William; Koning, Jeffrey L; Baldwin, D Duane",Journal of endourology,https://doi.org/10.1089/end.2010.0623; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21631303/,52

Seven studies reporting on the association between NIRS-based cerebral oxygenated hemoglobin measurements, mortality, modified Rankin Scale, Glasgow Outcome Scale, or Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale were identified. Forty-two studies exploring associations with neurophysiological parameters were included. Notwithstanding significant gaps in the currently available literature, our analysis suggests a link between NIRS-detected cerebral hypoxia during the acute phase of traumatic brain injury and poor functional outcome. NIRS measurements appear to reflect changes in intracranial pressure, invasively monitored brain tissue oxygen tension and various cerebrovascular reactivity indices although low quality contradicting data exist.

100154,Identifying G-Quadruplex-DNA-Disrupting Small Molecules.,2021-08-04,"Dengue virus is considered to be the most important mosquito-borne virus worldwide and poses formidable economic and health care burdens on many tropical and subtropical countries. Dengue infection induces drastic rearrangement of host endoplasmic reticulum membranes into complex membranous structures housing replication complexes; the contribution(s) of host proteins and pathways to this process is poorly understood but is likely to be mediated by protein-protein interactions. We have developed an approach for obtaining high confidence protein-protein interaction data by employing affinity tags and quantitative proteomics, in the context of viral infection, followed by robust statistical analysis. Using this approach, we identified high confidence interactors of NS5, the viral polymerase, and NS3, the helicase/protease. Quantitative proteomics allowed us to exclude a large number of presumably nonspecific interactors from our data sets and imparted a high level of confidence to our resulting data sets. We identified 53 host proteins reproducibly associated with NS5 and 41 with NS3, with 13 of these candidates present in both data sets. The host factors identified have diverse functions, including retrograde Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum transport, biosynthesis of long-chain fatty-acyl-coenzyme As, and in the unfolded protein response. We selected GBF1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor responsible for ARF activation, from the NS5 data set for follow up and functional validation. We show that GBF1 plays a critical role early in dengue infection that is independent of its role in the maintenance of Golgi structure. Importantly, the approach described here can be applied to virtually any organism/system as a tool for better understanding its molecular interactions.","Carpp, Lindsay N; Rogers, Richard S; Moritz, Robert L; Aitchison, John D",Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.m114.038984; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24855065/,52

Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a new technique aiming to minimize the invasiveness of the procedure. By comparing the degree of coagulation and fibrinolysis activation after conventional multiport (CLC) and single-incision (SILC) laparoscopic cholecystectomy, we aimed to determine whether the reduced incision size induces a lower thrombophilic tendency. Thirty-two adult patients with noncomplicated symptomatic cholelithiasis were nonrandomly assigned to CLC or SILC. Prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F1 + 2), thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT), D-dimers, fibrinogen, and von Willebrand factor levels were measured at baseline, at 1st, and 24th hour, postoperatively. Twenty-six patients were finally included in the study. Fifteen patients underwent CLC (male/female: 5/10) and 11 underwent SILC (male/female: 1/10). There were no perioperative complications. An almost similar postoperative pattern and degree of activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis pathways was noted in both groups. No statistically significant differences were found between SILC and CLC for F1 + 2, TAT, D-dimers, fibrinogen, and von Willebrand factor levels, duration of surgery, length of hospital stay, and postoperative morbidity. A similar pattern and extent of coagulation and fibrinolysis activation is present in SILC and CLC, and therefore there is no difference in tendency for thrombosis. Thromboembolic prophylaxis should be considered in SILC as recommended for CLC, pharmacologic or mechanical, considering the hemorrhagic risk and the presence of additional thromboembolism risk factors. SILC appears to be a safe, feasible technique that can be recommended for its potential advantages in cosmesis and reduced incisional pain.","Zezos, Petros; Christoforidou, Anna; Kouklakis, Georgios; Tsalikidis, Christos; Dimakis, Constantinos; Laftsidis, Prodromos; Virgiliou, Andriana; Simopoulos, Constantinos; Pitiakoudis, Michail",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350613484591; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23575915/,52

An otolaryngologist diagnosed all VCP cases. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The incidence and severity of VCP after extubation. RESULTS The incidence (number) of VCP was 4.7% (32), with those of mild, moderate and severe VCP being 1.7% (12), 1.5% (10) and 1.5% (10), respectively. The ICU stay was significantly longer in patients with severe VCP than in patients without VCP [12.5 days (interquartile range 5.5 to 25.5) vs. 3 days (interquartile range 2 to 5), P = 0.0002]. In our multivariable analysis, type 2 diabetes mellitus [odds ratio (OR) 1.853, P = 0.009], intubation period (OR per 24 h 1.136, P = 0.014), ascending aortic arch surgery with brachiocephalic artery reconstruction (OR 8.708, P < 0.001) and ventricular assist device implantation (OR 3.460, P = 0.005) were independent predictors for VCP. CONCLUSION The identification of these risk factors may facilitate screening for VCP before extubation and possibly help anaesthesia personnel to be prepared to treat VCP-related airway obstruction should it occur.","Taenaka, Hiroki; Shibata, Sho Carl; Okitsu, Kenta; Iritakenishi, Takeshi; Imada, Tatsuyuki; Uchiyama, Akinori; Fujino, Yuji",European journal of anaesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/eja.0000000000000648; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28590308/,52

We will also discuss techniques to reduce the spread of an undiagnosed uterine sarcoma. METHOD A comprehensive literature search was made in Pubmed, Medline, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar for articles related to the incidence of occult uterine sarcoma after morcellation. RESULTS Fibroids are benign uterine tumors and are a common indication for gynecologic surgery. Increasingly, gynecologists are approaching these surgeries with minimally invasive techniques. Uterine sarcomas are rare malignant mesenchymal tumors that are difficult to distinguish preoperatively from uterine fibroids. CONCLUSION During a minimally invasive surgery, there is a risk of disseminating an occult sarcoma during tissue extraction. Minimally invasive gynecologists are tasked with balancing taking a minimally invasive approach, which is shown to result in better patient outcomes, with minimizing the risk of spreading an occult sarcoma.","Wong, Marron; De Wilde, Rudy Leon; Isaacson, Keith",Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00404-017-4575-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29128980/,52

Method: We searched PUBMED for articles listed using the search terms ""COVID 19 Pandemic"", COVID19 and genes,"" ""stress and COVID 19"", Stress and Social distancing: Results: Long-term social distancing may be neurologically harmful, the consequence of epigenetic insults to the gene encoding the primary receptor for SARS-CoV2, and COVID 19. The gene is Angiotensin I Converting-Enzyme 2 (ACE2). According to the multi-experiment matrix (MEM), the gene exhibiting the most statistically significant co-expression link to ACE2 is Dopa Decarboxylase (DDC). DDC is a crucial enzyme that participates in the synthesis of both dopamine and serotonin. SARS-CoV2-induced downregulation of ACE2 expression might reduce dopamine and serotonin synthesis, causing hypodopaminergia. Discussion: Indeed, added to the known reduced dopamine function during periods of stress, including social distancing the consequence being both genetic and epigenetic vulnerability to all Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) addictive behaviors. Stress seen in PTSD can generate downstream alterations in immune functions by reducing methylation levels of immune-related genes. Conclusion: Mitigation of these effects by identifying subjects at risk and promoting dopaminergic homeostasis to help regulate stress-relative hypodopaminergia, attenuate fears, and prevent subsequent unwanted drug and non-drug RDS type addictive behaviors seems prudent.","Blum, Kenneth; Cadet, Jean Lud; Baron, David; Badgaiyan, Rajendra D; Brewer, Raymond; Modestino, Edward J; Gold, Mark S",Substance use & misuse,https://doi.org/10.1080/10826084.2020.1817086; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32957797/,52

104519,Peptide-based Fusion Inhibitors for Preventing the Six-helix Bundle Formation of Class I Fusion Proteins: HIV and Beyond.,2021-09-07,"INTRODUCTION Internal herniation is a potential complication following laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). Previous studies have shown that closure of mesenteric defects after LRYGB may reduce the incidence of internal herniation. However, controversy remains as to whether mesenteric defect closure is necessary to decrease the incidence of internal hernias after LRYGB. This study aims to determine if jejeunal mesenteric defect closure reduces incidence of internal hernias and other complications in patients undergoing LRYGB. METHODS 105 patients undergoing laparoscopic antecolic RYGB were randomized into two groups: closed mesenteric defect (n = 50) or open mesenteric defect (n = 55). Complication rates were obtained from the medical record. Patients were followed up to 3 years post-operatively. Patients also completed the gastrointestinal quality of life index (GI QoL) pre-operatively and 12 months post-operatively. Outcome measures included: incidence of internal hernias, complications, readmissions, reoperations, GI QoL scores, and percent excess weight loss (%EWL). RESULTS Pre-operatively, there were no significant differences between the two groups. The closed group had a longer operative time (closed-153 min, open-138 min, p = 0.073). There was one internal hernia in the open group. There was no significant difference at 12 months for decrease in BMI (closed-15.9, open-16.3 kg/m(2), p = 0.288) or %EWL (closed-75.3%, open-69.0%, p = 0.134). There was no significant difference between the groups in incidence of internal hernias and general complications post-operatively. Both groups showed significantly improved GI QoL index scores from baseline to 12 months post-surgery, but there were no significant differences at 12 months between groups in total GI QoL (closed-108, open-112, p = 0.440). CONCLUSIONS In this study, closure or non-closure of the jejeunal mesenteric defect following LRYGB appears to result in equivalent internal hernia and complication rates. High index of suspicion should be maintained whenever internal hernia is expected after LRYGB.","Rosas, Ulysses; Ahmed, Shusmita; Leva, Natalia; Garg, Trit; Rivas, Homero; Lau, James; Russo, Michael; Morton, John M",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3970-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25480607/,52

104569,Hallmarks of the aging T cell system.,2021-02-16,"BACKGROUND Adult community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a relevant worldwide cause of morbidity and mortality, however the aetiology often remains uncertain and the therapy is empirical. We applied conventional and molecular diagnostics to identify viruses and atypical bacteria associated with CAP in Chile. METHODS We used sputum and blood cultures, IgG/IgM serology and molecular diagnostic techniques (PCR, reverse transcriptase PCR) for detection of classical and atypical bacteria (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella pneumoniae) and respiratory viruses (adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenzavirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus) in adults >18 years old presenting with CAP in Santiago from February 2005 to September 2007. Severity was qualified at admission by Fine's pneumonia severity index. RESULTS Overall detection in 356 enrolled adults were 92 (26%) cases of a single bacterial pathogen, 80 (22%) cases of a single viral pathogen, 60 (17%) cases with mixed bacterial and viral infection and 124 (35%) cases with no identified pathogen. Streptococcus pneumoniae and RSV were the most common bacterial and viral pathogens identified. Infectious agent detection by PCR provided greater sensitivity than conventional techniques. To our surprise, no relationship was observed between clinical severity and sole or coinfections. CONCLUSIONS The use of molecular diagnostics expanded the detection of viruses and atypical bacteria in adults with CAP, as unique or coinfections. Clinical severity and outcome were independent of the aetiological agents detected.","Luchsinger, Vivian; Ruiz, Mauricio; Zunino, Enna; Martínez, María Angélica; Machado, Clarisse; Piedra, Pedro A; Fasce, Rodrigo; Ulloa, María Teresa; Fink, Maria Cristina; Lara, Pamela; Gebauer, Mónica; Chávez, Fernando; Avendaño, Luis F",Thorax,https://doi.org/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2013-203551; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23783373/,52

To study electromagnetic stimulation (EMS) for the disinfection of root canal in vitro, single rooted teeth were instrumented with a 45.05 Wave One Gold reciprocating file. Specimens were sterilized and inoculated with Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29,212, which grew for 15 days to form an established biofilm. Samples were treated with 6% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), 1.5% NaOCl 1.5% NaOCl with EMS, 0.9% saline with EMS or 0.9% saline. After treatments, the colony forming units (CFU) was determined. Data was analyzed by Wilcoxon Rank Sums Test (α = 0.05). One sample per group was scored and split for confocal laser scanning microscopy imaging. There was a significant effect with the use of NaOCl with or without EMS versus 0.9% saline with or without EMS (p = 0.012 and 0.003, respectively). CFUs were lower when using 0.9% saline with EMS versus 0.9% saline alone (p = 0.002). Confocal imaging confirmed CFU findings. EMS with saline has an antibiofilm effect against E. faecalis and can potentially be applied for endodontic disinfection.","Panariello, Beatriz H D; Kindler, Justin K; Spolnik, Kenneth J; Ehrlich, Ygal; Eckert, George J; Duarte, Simone",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-87922-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33859338/,52

We investigated alcohol use during lockdown in a population of college students, usually characterized by social and heavy drinking. We also tested the predictive role of pre-lockdown drinking motives on alcohol consumption during lockdown. We collected data from 1951 French-speaking Belgian students during the lockdown period (April 1st - May 3rd, 2020) through a cross-sectional online survey. Participants self-reported their daily alcohol consumption (1) during a typical week in normal circumstances (i.e., before lockdown), and (2) since lockdown onset. We also assessed drinking motives and severity of alcohol use before lockdown. Our findings showed that 68.2% of the sample reported a lower alcohol consumption during lockdown compared to before lockdown, 17.2% conversely reporting a higher consumption. Enhancement, social and coping motives were all associated with heavy drinking before lockdown. Enhancement and social motives predicted lower alcohol consumption during lockdown among heavy drinkers. Conversely, coping motives, as well as social motives among low drinkers, predicted higher consumption during lockdown. Conformity motives, as well as enhancement motives among low and moderate drinkers, did not predict alcohol consumption before or during lockdown. Overall, several pre-lockdown drinking motives reliably predicted alcohol consumption during lockdown and could thus be used to identify at-risk populations and to tailor intervention programs on alcohol misuse during sanitary crises.","Bollen, Zoé; Pabst, Arthur; Creupelandt, Coralie; Fontesse, Sullivan; Lannoy, Séverine; Pinon, Nicolas; Maurage, Pierre",Addictive behaviors,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2020.106772; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33418433/,52

Objective: The aim was to investigate the frequency and severity of STD in COVID-19 patients and to evaluate the association with demographic characteristics, hospital admission, symptoms, comorbidities, and blood biomarkers. METHODS A multicenter cross-sectional study on SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (n=846) and controls (n=143) from 15 Spanish Hospitals. Data of STD with an in-person survey was collected prospectively. STD severity was categorized by visual analogue scale. STD onset time, recovery rate, time to recovery, hospital admission, pneumonia diagnosis, comorbidities, smoking and symptoms were analyzed. RESULTS STD were at least 2-fold more common in COVID-19-positive compared to controls. In COVID-19-positive, hospitalized patients were older, with lower frequency of STD and recovered earlier than out-patients. Stratified analysis by severity of STD showed that more than a half of COVID-19 subjects presented severe loss of smell (53.7%) or taste (52.2%), in >90% this impairment was of both senses. In the multivariate analysis, an older age (>60yo), being hospitalized and an increased level of C-reactive protein were factors associated with a better sense of smell and/or taste. COVID-19-positive patients reported improvement of smell (45.6%) and taste (46.1%) at the time of the survey, 90.6% in less than two weeks' post-infection. CONCLUSIONS STD is a common symptom in COVID-19, and mainly present in young and non-hospitalized patients.

The study aims to examine the use of drug supplements in patients with dermatological disorders, regarding their type, the reasons and predictors of their use, and the safety beliefs and communication attitude of users. MATERIALS AND METHODS A cross-sectional study of patients hospitalized in the Clinic of Dermatology and Venereology at the University Нospital in Stara Zagora, Bulgaria, was carried out from October 2018 to December 2019. Data were collected using a specially designed and validated questionnaire. Statistical analysis included the χ2-test, the Mann-Whitney U test, and logistic regression. RESULTS Overall 348 patients (204 females and 144 males) were involved in the study. The patients who reported having used dietary supplements were 67% of the study population. Various combinations ranked first among the dietary supplement types, and vitamins/minerals presented a substantial part (75.9%). The majority of the patients (61.6%) used dietary supplements for more than one reason, mainly for organ-related disorders. Most of the respondents (76.4%) considered them to be completely safe. Higher education (OR = 1.91; CI: 1.14 - 3.19), being a non-smoker (OR = 1.81; CI:1.14 - 2.88), and sporting activities (OR = 1.71; CI: 1.03 - 2.83) increased the odds of using dietary supplements. CONCLUSION The examined cohort of dermatology patients presented a dietary supplement user profile similar to the general population.

Here, we present the virological features relevant to clinical practice, and summarize the epidemiology, clinical findings, diagnosis, treatment, and preventive strategies of A(H7N9) infection. RECENT FINDINGS As of 18 February 2014, A(H7N9) virus has caused 354 infections in mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong with a case-fatality rate of 32%. Elderly men were most affected. Most patients acquired the infection from direct contact with poultry or from a contaminated environment, although person-to-person transmission has likely occurred. A(H7N9) infection has usually presented with severe pneumonia, often complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure. Mild infections have been reported in children and young adults. Nasopharyngeal aspirate and sputum samples should be collected for diagnosis, preferably using reverse transcriptase-PCR. Early treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors improved survival, but the efficacy of antivirals was hampered by resistant mutants. The closure of live poultry markets in affected areas has significantly contributed to the decline in the incidence of human cases. SUMMARY The emergence of A(H7N9) virus represents a significant health threat. High vigilance is necessary so that appropriate treatment can be instituted for the patient and preventive measures can be implemented.","To, Kelvin K-W; Chan, Jasper F-W; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcp.0000000000000047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24637225/,52

Additionally, few studies have looked at neonatal respiratory distress and its predictors in developing countries, and thus we sought to investigate this issue in neonates who were admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Black Lion Specialized Hospital, Ethiopia. METHODS An institution-based retrospective follow-up study was conducted with 571 neonates from January 2013 to March 2018. Data were collected by reviewing patients' charts using a systematic sampling technique with a pretested checklist. The data was then entered using Epi-data 4.2 and analyzed with STATA 14. Median time, Kaplan-Meier survival estimation curves, and log-rank tests were then computed. Bivariable and multivariable Gompertz parametric hazard models were fitted to detect the determinants of respiratory distress. The hazard ratio with a 95% confidence interval was subsequently calculated. Variables with reported p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS The proportion of neonates with respiratory distress among those admitted to the Black Lion Specialized Hospital neonatal intensive care unit was 42.9% (95%CI: 39.3-46.1%) The incidence rate was 8.1/100 (95%CI: 7.3, 8.9). Significant predictors of respiratory distress in neonates included being male [Adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 2.4 (95%CI: 1.1, 3.1)], born via caesarean section [AHR: 1.9 (95%CI: 1.6, 2.3)], home delivery [AHR: 2.9 (95%CI: 1.5, 5,2)], maternal diabetes mellitus (AHR: 2.3 (95%CI: 1.4, 3.6)), preterm birth [AHR: 2.9 (95%CI: 1.6, 5.1)], and having an Apgar score of less than 7 [AHR: 3.1 (95%CI: 1.8, 5.0)]. CONCLUSIONS In this study, the proportion of respiratory distress (RD) was high. Preterm birth, delivery by caesarean section, Apgar score < 7, sepsis, maternal diabetes mellitus, and home delivery were all significant predictors of this condition. Based on our findings this would likely include encouraging more hospital births, better control of diabetes in pregnancy, improved neonatal resuscitation and addressing ways to decrease the need for frequent caesarean sections.","Aynalem, Yared Asmare; Mekonen, Hussien; Akalu, Tadesse Yirga; Habtewold, Tesfa Dejenie; Endalamaw, Aklilu; Petrucka, Pammla Margaret; Shiferaw, Wondimeneh Shibabaw",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235544; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609748/,52

109640,A non-human primate model of bipedal locomotion under restrained condition allowing gait studies and single unit brain recordings.,2012,"BACKGROUND Surgical training has traditionally been one of apprenticeship, where the surgical trainee learns to perform surgery under the supervision of a trained surgeon. This is time consuming, costly, and of variable effectiveness. Training using a box model physical simulator - either a video box or a mirrored box - is an option to supplement standard training. However, the impact of this modality on trainees with no prior laparoscopic experience is unknown. OBJECTIVES To compare the benefits and harms of box model training versus no training, another box model, animal model, or cadaveric model training for surgical trainees with no prior laparoscopic experience. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded to May 2013. SELECTION CRITERIA We included all randomised clinical trials comparing box model trainers versus no training in surgical trainees with no prior laparoscopic experience. We also included trials comparing different methods of box model training. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two authors independently identified trials and collected data. We analysed the data with both the fixed-effect and the random-effects models using Review Manager for analysis. For each outcome, we calculated the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible. MAIN RESULTS Twenty-five trials contributed data to the quantitative synthesis in this review. All but one trial were at high risk of bias. Overall, 16 trials (464 participants) provided data for meta-analysis of box training (248 participants) versus no supplementary training (216 participants). All the 16 trials in this comparison used video trainers. Overall, 14 trials (382 participants) provided data for quantitative comparison of different methods of box training. There were no trials comparing box model training versus animal model or cadaveric model training. Box model training versus no training: The meta-analysis showed that the time taken for task completion was significantly shorter in the box trainer group than the control group (8 trials; 249 participants; SMD -0.48 seconds; 95% CI -0.74 to -0.22). Compared with the control group, the box trainer group also had lower error score (3 trials; 69 participants; SMD -0.69; 95% CI -1.21 to -0.17), better accuracy score (3 trials; 73 participants; SMD 0.67; 95% CI 0.18 to 1.17), and better composite performance scores (SMD 0.65; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.88). Three trials reported movement distance but could not be meta-analysed as they were not in a format for meta-analysis. There was significantly lower movement distance in the box model training compared with no training in one trial, and there were no significant differences in the movement distance between the two groups in the other two trials. None of the remaining secondary outcomes such as mortality and morbidity were reported in the trials when animal models were used for assessment of training, error in movements, and trainee satisfaction. Different methods of box training: One trial (36 participants) found significantly shorter time taken to complete the task when box training was performed using a simple cardboard box trainer compared with the standard pelvic trainer (SMD -3.79 seconds; 95% CI -4.92 to -2.65). There was no significant difference in the time taken to complete the task in the remaining three comparisons (reverse alignment versus forward alignment box training; box trainer suturing versus box trainer drills; and single incision versus multiport box model training). There were no significant differences in the error score between the two groups in any of the comparisons (box trainer suturing versus box trainer drills; single incision versus multiport box model training; Z-maze box training versus U-maze box training). The only trial that reported accuracy score found significantly higher accuracy score with Z-maze box training than U-maze box training (1 trial; 16 participants; SMD 1.55; 95% CI 0.39 to 2.71). One trial (36 participants) found significantly higher composite score with simple cardboard box trainer compared with conventional pelvic trainer (SMD 0.87; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.56). Another trial (22 participants) found significantly higher composite score with reverse alignment compared with forward alignment box training (SMD 1.82; 95% CI 0.79 to 2.84). There were no significant differences in the composite score between the intervention and control groups in any of the remaining comparisons. None of the secondary outcomes were adequately reported in the trials. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS The results of this review are threatened by both risks of systematic errors (bias) and risks of random errors (play of chance). Laparoscopic box model training appears to improve technical skills compared with no training in trainees with no previous laparoscopic experience. The impacts of this decreased time on patients and healthcare funders in terms of improved outcomes or decreased costs are unknown. There appears to be no significant differences in the improvement of technical skills between different methods of box model training. Further well-designed trials of low risk of bias and random errors are necessary. Such trials should assess the impacts of box model training on surgical skills in both the short and long term, as well as clinical outcomes when the trainee becomes competent to operate on patients.","Nagendran, Myura; Toon, Clare D; Davidson, Brian R; Gurusamy, Kurinchi Selvan",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd010479.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24442763/,52

This review assesses the extent and handling of missing outcome data in the TBI literature and provides a practical guide for future research. Relevant electronic databases were searched from January 1, 2012 to October 27, 2017 for TBI studies that used the Glasgow Outcome Scale or Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS/GOSE) as an outcome measure. Studies were screened and data extracted in line with Cochrane guidance. A total of 195 studies, 21 interventional, 174 observational, with 104,688 patients were included. Using the reported follow-up rates in a mixed model, on average 91% of patients were predicted to return to follow-up at 6 months post-injury, 84% at 1 year, and 69% at 2 years. However, 36% of studies provided insufficient information to determine the number of subjects at each time-point. Of 139 studies that did report missing outcome data, only 50% attempted to identify why data were missing, with just 4 reporting their assumption on the ""missingness mechanism."" The handling of missing data was heterogeneous, with the most common method being its exclusion from analysis. These results confirm substantial variability in the standard of reporting and handling of missing outcome data in TBI research. We conclude that practical guidance is needed to facilitate meaningful and accurate study interpretation, and therefore propose a framework for the handling of missing outcome data in future TBI research.","Richter, Sophie; Stevenson, Susan; Newman, Tom; Wilson, Lindsay; Menon, David K; Maas, Andrew I R; Nieboer, Daan; Lingsma, Hester; Steyerberg, Ewout W; Newcombe, Virginia F J",Journal of neurotrauma,https://doi.org/10.1089/neu.2018.6216; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062649/,52

So, no one is safe until everyone is safe. Worldwide researchers are looking for the vaccine to remove the need for social distancing, mask-wearing and social gathering. A vaccine is like many other outcomes if the vaccine would be available; we cannot say about the effectiveness of the vaccine. Several drugs are testing to save the people life from pandemic; azithromycin is one of them. This work is a review article with the updated findings of azithromycin in the context of COVID-19. The option of azithromycin with regards to COVID-19 is justified by its anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and anti-fibrotic effects and their pharmacokinetic properties, leading to effective concentrations in the target tissue. Azithromycin tends to be an effective candidate for SARS-CoV-2 replication inhibition that block the initial stage of the viral life cycle. Clinical trials at a preliminary scale and final stage show the significant results of azithromycin in supportive care therapy. Azithromycin was an early candidate for the medication of Covid-19 with or without hydroxychloroquine. It is exercised mostly as an outpatient antibiotic in COVID-19. In summing-up, any primary anti-viral and antibiotic treatment is not the only possibility of fighting COVID-19 pharmacologically. It will be an injustice with them who require broader spectrum antibiotic if we do not exercise azithromycin to them. So significant research priority is needed to determine whether azithromycin is useful in the treatment of COVID-19.","Wahab, Shadma; Ahmad, Md Faruque; Hussain, Arshad; Usmani, Shazia; Shoaib, Ambreen; Ahmad, Wasim",Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.2174/1389557521666210401093948; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33797374/,52

The effect of pH, temperature, oxygen flow rate and neutralization reagent on As removal was investigated. The results showed that pH was important to As removal efficiency, which achieved maximum in 0.25-2 h, but decreased from ∼100 % to ∼92.6 % with the increase of pH 5-9. pH, temperature and oxygen flow rate played key roles in As(III) oxidation. The increase of As(III) oxidized from 16.8 to 67.1% to 98.6-99.0 % occurred as increasing the pH 5-9, 25-95 °C and oxygen flow rate of 0-2.4 L min-1. NaOH or Ca(OH)2 as base was less important to As removal. The mechanism involved Fenton-like reaction between Fe(II) and O2 for produced Fe(III) (oxy)hydroxide association with As(III + V) and Mn(II), catalytic Mn(II) oxidation for the formation of Mn(III, IV) oxides, and further As(III) oxidation by Mn(III, IV) oxides. As-bearing six-line ferrihydrite was the main solid product for low As-leaching fixation. pH 8, 95 °C and oxygen flow rate of 1.6 L min-1 were optimal for As removal.","Yuan, Zidan; Zhang, Guoqing; Ma, Xu; Yu, Le; Wang, Xin; Wang, Shaofeng; Jia, Yongfeng",Journal of hazardous materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.123360; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32645540/,52

110848,Infectious Risks of Traveling Abroad.,2015,"Polymer film capacitor with high energy density has attracted great attention in past decades to accomplish the requirements of miniaturization and lightweight for electronics and energy storage system. The multi-layered nanocomposite exhibits an effective route for developing polymer film with large energy capability due to the advantage of each layer. Here, two sandwich constructions of boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs)/poly(vinylidene fluoride-chlorotrifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-CTFE)) nanocomposite film were designed to investigate the effects of architecture regulation on energy storage performance,i.e., the nanocomposite serving as inner layer with pristine films as outer layers, in which the nanocomposite film delivers a strongly polarized behavior and the pristine polymer provides a high breakdown strength. The BNNSs were liquid exfoliated from boron nitride bulk assisted with fluoro hyperbranched copolymer that was adsorbed on the surface of nanosheetsviaCH-π non-covalent interactions. The presence of fluoro segments improves the compatibility between nanosheets and P(VDF-CTFE) matrix. The maximum polarization of 7.9 μC cm-2at 300 MV m-1is achieved in the tailored sandwich film, and the discharged energy density of 9.1 J cm-3is obtained in current nanocomposite, which benefits from the barrier effect between adjacent layers induced by the redistribution of electric field and emerging charge traps at the interfaces. This sandwich BNNSs/P(VDF-CTFE) nanocomposite provides an insight prospect for structural design with respect to the advanced application of polymer film capacitor.","Zhang, Xuanhe; Ye, Huijian; Chen, Hongyun; Xu, Lixin",Nanotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6528/ab932d; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408290/,52

Following Lokumage's original usage of the term, this paper explores 'obstetric iatrogenesis' along a spectrum ranging from unintentional harm (UH) to overt disrespect, violence, and abuse (DVA), employing the acronym 'UHDVA' for this spectrum. This paper draws attention to the systemic maltreatment rooted in the technocratic model of birth, which includes UH normalized forms of mistreatment that childbearers and providers may not recognize as abusive. Equally, this paper assesses how obstetric iatrogenesis disproportionately impacts Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), contributing to worse perinatal outcomes for BIPOC childbearers. Much of the work on 'obstetric violence' that documents the most detrimental end of the UHDVA spectrum has focused on low-to-middle income countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Based on a dataset of 62 interviews and on our personal observations, this paper shows that significant UHDVA also occurs in the high-income U.S., provide concrete examples, and suggest humanistic solutions.","Liese, Kylea L; Davis-Floyd, Robbie; Stewart, Karie; Cheyney, Melissa",Anthropology & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/13648470.2021.1938510; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34196238/,52
111676,Endemic and emerging acute virus infections in Indonesia: an overview of the past decade and implications for the future.,2018,"OBJECTIVE To investigate the relationship between somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) amplitudes and neurologic outcome after cardiac arrest. METHODS We prospectively studied SSEPs, recorded 24 hours to 4 days after cardiac arrest, in patients with targeted temperature management. SSEP amplitude was defined pragmatically as the highest short-latency amplitude of 4 cortical recordings (2 per side, CP3/CP4 vs Fz) at least 4.5 ms after the spinal SSEP. Cerebral performance category (CPC) was determined upon intensive care unit discharge. CPC 1-3 was defined as good, CPC 4-5 as poor outcome. RESULTS Of 318 patients, 25 had incomplete recordings, no reproducible spinal SSEP, or high noise level. Of the remaining 293 patients, 137 (47%) had poor and 156 (53%) good outcome. The lowest amplitude in a survivor with good outcome was 0.62 μV. All 78 patients with lower amplitudes had poor outcome. None of 27 patients with CPC 4 (unresponsive wakefulness) had amplitudes above 2.5 μV. In the majority of 24 patients who died despite amplitudes above 2.5 μV, clinical course and other prognostic parameters argued against severe hypoxic encephalopathy. CONCLUSIONS The prognostic value of SSEPs extends beyond an absent/present dichotomy. Absent and very low amplitude SSEPs appear to be highly predictive of poor outcome after cardiac arrest. Prospective external validation of the lower threshold found in our study is necessary. SSEP recordings should not be used for prognostication if noise could mask potentials with critically low amplitudes. High SSEP amplitudes argue against severe hypoxic encephalopathy.","Endisch, Christian; Storm, Christian; Ploner, Christoph J; Leithner, Christoph",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000002123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26491086/,52

Outcome parameters were measured in accordance with the thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. RESULTS In all, 78% underwent endovascular and 22% conservative medical treatment. The NIHSS at admission was 20 in both the groups. Postprocedurally, 36% (95% confidence interval: 26%-48%) of the endovascular group and 9% (21%-64%) of the conservative group reached TICI 3 (P = .017). In all, 30% of the endovascular group and 9% of the conservative group were documented with TICI 2b (P = .057).

Funerals traditionally managed and assuaged grief through ritual expression, approval, and social support. Research suggests that satisfying funeral participation reduces grief, while poverty exacerbates it. We hypothesized that: (1) psycho-physical symptoms of grief, (2) abbreviation/dissatisfaction in the funeral, and (3) poverty, correlate with decreased productivity and increased medical and social services use. We collected data from 165 mourning families about their grief, funerals, and subsequent medical conditions. (1) Deeper grief after bereavement in Japan correlated with more physical problems, more down time, and more medical dependency. (2) Low satisfaction with funerals correlated with higher hospital, pharmacy, and counseling costs. (3) Low income families lost more time, while declining incomes showed increased pharmaceutical costs. This suggests that satisfying funerals and income safeguards may reduce costs of low productivity and increased public services dependency.","Becker, Carl B; Taniyama, Yozo; Kondo-Arita, Megumi; Yamada, Shinya; Yamamoto, Kayoko",Omega,https://doi.org/10.1177/0030222820947573; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32842880/,52

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed our patients undergoing robotic cardiac reoperation (redo group) from July 2013 to April 2017 at our institution and compared with our patients undergoing standard robotic surgery (nonredo group). In the reoperative cases, a thoracoscope was inserted through a 5-mm port placed away from the previous scar. Another 5-mm port was inserted under direct vision to make space for one or two robotic arms, and further precise dissection was performed robotically. RESULTS A total of 486 patients underwent robotic-assisted cardiac surgery. There were 36 patients who had one or more previous cardiac surgeries (42 surgeries). Although the mean operative and cardiopulmonary bypass time were longer in the redo group (median = 351 minutes vs. 289 minutes and 219 minutes vs. 178 minutes, P < 0.05, respectively), cardiac arrest time was similar between two groups. The redo group had a higher incidence of postoperative prolonged ventilation (16.7% vs. 6.9%, P = 0.046) and pneumonia (11.1% vs. 0.2%, P < 0.001). The 30-day mortality was 2.8% (1/36) in the redo group and similar to that in the nonredo group (1.3%, P = 0.419). CONCLUSIONS Robotic cardiac reoperation is feasible with acceptable clinical outcomes including a low mortality rate similar to standard robotic surgery in our hands. Robotic assistance may have the potential to minimize morbidity and mortality.","Kitahara, Hiroto; Wehman, Brody; Balkhy, Husam H",Innovations,https://doi.org/10.1097/imi.0000000000000567; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547897/,52
112398,DNA vaccines for targeting bacterial infections.,2010,"BACKGROUND Patients with COVID-19 and ARDS on prolonged mechanical ventilation are at risk for developing endotracheal tube (ETT) obstruction that has not been previously described in patients with ARDS due to other causes. The purpose of this report is to describe a case series of patients with COVID-19 and ARDS in which ETT occlusion resulted in significant clinical consequences and to define the pathology of the obstructing material. METHODS Incidents of ETT occlusion during mechanical ventilation of COVID-19 patients were reported by clinicians and retrospective chart review was conducted. Statistical analysis was performed comparing event rates between COVID-19 and non-COVID 19 patients on mechanical ventilation over the predefined period. Specimens were collected and submitted for pathological examination. FINDINGS Eleven COVID-19 patients experienced endotracheal tube occlusion over a period of 2 months. Average age was 69 (14.3, range 33-85) years. Mean APACHE III score was 73.6 (17.3). All patients had AKI and cytokine storm. Nine exhibited biomarkers for hypercoagulability. Average days on mechanical ventilation before intervention for ETT occlusion was 14 (5.18) days (range of 9 to 23 days). Five patients were discharged from the ICU, and 4 expired. Average documented airway resistance on admission was 14.2 (3.0) cm H2O/L/sec. Airway resistance before tube exchange was 28.1 (8.0) cm H2O /L/sec. No similar events of endotracheal tube occlusion were identified in non-COVID patients on mechanical ventilation during the same time period. Microscopically, the material consisted of mucin admixed with necrotic cell debris, variable numbers of degenerated inflammatory cells, oral contaminants and red blood cells. INTERPRETATION Patients with COVID-19 and ARDS on prolonged mechanical ventilation are at risk for developing ETT obstruction due to deposition of a thick, tenacious material within the tube that consists primarily of mucin and cellular debris. Clinicians should be aware of this dangerous but treatable complication.","Wiles, Samuel; Mireles-Cabodevila, Eduardo; Neuhofs, Scott; Mukhopadhyay, Sanjay; Reynolds, Jordan P; Hatipoğlu, Umur",Journal of intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0885066620981891; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33375893/,52

We carried out an observational study to identify ethnic group differences for lower respiratory tract infections. DESIGN A retrospective, cohort study. SETTING Scotland. PARTICIPANTS 4.65 million people on whom information was available from the 2001 census, followed from May 2001 to April 2010. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Hospitalisations and deaths (any time following first hospitalisation) from lower respiratory tract infections, adjusted risk ratios and hazard ratios by ethnicity and sex were calculated. We multiplied ratios and confidence intervals by 100, so the reference Scottish White population's risk ratio and hazard ratio was 100. RESULTS Among men, adjusted risk ratios for lower respiratory tract infection hospitalisation were lower in Other White British (80, 95% confidence interval 73-86) and Chinese (69, 95% confidence interval 56-84) populations and higher in Pakistani groups (152, 95% confidence interval 136-169). In women, results were mostly similar to those in men (e.g. Chinese 68, 95% confidence interval 56-82), although higher adjusted risk ratios were found among women of the Other South Asians group (145, 95% confidence interval 120-175). Survival (adjusted hazard ratio) following lower respiratory tract infection for Pakistani men (54, 95% confidence interval 39-74) and women (31, 95% confidence interval 18-53) was better than the reference population. CONCLUSIONS Substantial differences in the rates of lower respiratory tract infections amongst different ethnic groups in Scotland were found. Pakistani men and women had particularly high rates of lower respiratory tract infection hospitalisation. The reasons behind the high rates of lower respiratory tract infection in the Pakistani community are now required.","Simpson, Colin R; Steiner, Markus Fc; Cezard, Genevieve; Bansal, Narinder; Fischbacher, Colin; Douglas, Anne; Bhopal, Raj; Sheikh, Aziz",Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0141076815588321; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26152675/,52
114233,Immunothrombosis and thromboinflammation in host defense and disease.,2020-09-08,"Background: Concern about the health impact of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in widespread enforced reductions in people's movement (""lockdowns""). However, there are increasing concerns about the severe economic and wider societal consequences of these measures. Some countries have begun to lift some of the rules on physical distancing in a stepwise manner, with differences in what these ""exit strategies"" entail and their timeframes. The aim of this work was to inform such exit strategies by exploring the types of indoor and outdoor settings where transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to occur and result in clusters of cases. Identifying potential settings that result in transmission clusters allows these to be kept under close surveillance and/or to remain closed as part of strategies that aim to avoid a resurgence in transmission following the lifting of lockdown measures. Methods: We performed a systematic review of available literature and media reports to find settings reported in peer reviewed articles and media with these characteristics. These sources are curated and made available in an editable online database. Results: We found many examples of SARS-CoV-2 clusters linked to a wide range of mostly indoor settings. Few reports came from schools, many from households, and an increasing number were reported in hospitals and elderly care settings across Europe. Conclusions: We identified possible places that are linked to clusters of COVID-19 cases and could be closely monitored and/or remain closed in the first instance following the progressive removal of lockdown restrictions. However, in part due to the limits in surveillance capacities in many settings, the gathering of information such as cluster sizes and attack rates is limited in several ways: inherent recall bias, biased media reporting and missing data.","Leclerc, Quentin J; Fuller, Naomi M; Knight, Lisa E; Funk, Sebastian; Knight, Gwenan M",Wellcome open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15889.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32656368/,52

However, not only is there little evidence on the relevance of the term in the palliative and end-of-life care literature but also a lack of a precise and uniform definition. METHOD With a text mining approach occurrence of the term patient safety was determined in all available abstracts of 10 palliative and end-of-life care journals. Furthermore, 4 electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PSYCINFO) were searched supplemented by hand-searching of relevant literature to identify and conceptualize published definitions of patient safety in the palliative and end-of-life care context. Publications were independently assessed against inclusion criteria by 2 authors. RESULTS Our search of 14,351 abstracts yielded 41 hits for ""patient safety"" ranking 2,345 in the list of most commonly encountered tokens. We identified 11 definitions of patient safety stemming from 11 publications. Definitions differed with regard to the concept of process or outcome. They also allowed distinctive perspectives on the extent to which patient care influences patient safety. Lastly, exact wording led to discrepancies in the understanding of unsafe care and generalizability of definitions. CONCLUSION Our results indicate that patient safety has gradually gained importance in palliative and end-of-life care. However, as key elements of definientia varied considerably no consensus definition could be identified. Nevertheless, a universal definition would help to facilitate communication and exchange of information among individuals and organizations involved in palliative and end-of-life care.","Pedrosa Carrasco, Anna J; Volberg, Christian; Pedrosa, David J; Berthold, Daniel",The American journal of hospice & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1177/1049909120971825; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33267627/,52

Obese patients (body mass index (BMI) ≥35 kg/m(2)) were matched with non-obese patients (BMI <30 kg/m(2)) based on renal function, age and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE)-II score at admission. All patients in this study received a loading dose of 25 mg/kg then a maintenance dose based on renal function according to the protocol. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board. The primary outcome was the weight-based total daily maintenance dose required to achieve a vancomycin level of 20 mg/L. The secondary endpoints included the achievement of a therapeutic level at 24 hours. RESULTS Twenty-six matched pairs of patients met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 17 pairs had preserved renal function and 9 pairs required continuous venovenous hemofiltration. Mean BMI was 40.9 kg/m(2) in obese and 24.8 kg/m(2) in non-obese patients. To achieve a vancomycin concentration of 20 mg/L, the weight-based daily maintenance dose in obese patients was 25.6 mg/kg versus 43.8 mg/kg in non-obese patients (p <0.01). Therapeutic 24-hour levels were achieved in 24/26 obese versus 23/26 no-obese patients (p = 0.63). Mean 24-hour vancomycin level was 20.3 ± 3.81 mcg/ml in obese compared to 20.03 ± 3.79 mcg/ml in non-obese patients (p = 0.77). Mean daily maintenance doses required to achieve a level of 20 mcg/ml were 2961 ± 1670 mg in obese compared to 3189 ± 1600.69 mg in non-obese (p = 0.61). CONCLUSIONS The results of our study suggest that critically ill obese patients treated with CIV required a significantly lower maintenance dose per unit of body weight than non-obese patients to achieve the same target level.","Lin, Hsin; Yeh, Daniel Dante; Levine, Alexander R",Critical care,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-016-1363-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27363312/,52

OBJECTIVE To calculate the overall reduction in monthly migraine days and the proportion contextual effect (PCE) using meta-analysis. The PCE is the ratio between the reduction in Monthly Migraine Days in the placebo group and the reduction in Monthly Migraine Days in the CGRP-Ab group after 3 months of treatment. METHODS Meta-analysis of randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials of anti-CGRP antibodies in people with episodic migraine (EM) or chronic migraine (CM) in persons aged 18 or over. Non-randomized trials and trials in persons under 18 years excluded. Search of National Clinical Trials Register 2000-2019, MEDLINE to September 2019, Hand search of major headache conference abstract books 2012-2019. Two investigators used standard proforma to reach consensus. Trial quality assessed using Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool. PRISMA guidelines followed. RESULTS 21 completed trials with 13367 participants (8075 EM, 5292 CM). Compared to placebo, pooled reduction in MMD was 1.50 days in 15 EM trials (95%CI 1.16, 1.84; I2 = 69%, Phetereogeneity < .001) and 2.24 days in 7 CM trials (95%CI 1.82, 2.65, I2 = 15%, Phetereogeneity = .320). In EM trials, pooled PCE was 0.66 (95%CI 0.59,0.75; I2 = 64%, Phetereogeneity = .001). In CM trials the PCE was .68 (95%CI 0.61, 0.75; I2 = 20%, Phetereogeneity = .280). Industry funded every study, but risk of bias was low. CONCLUSIONS CGRPAbs are effective but sixty-six percent of the benefit is from contextual effects, including placebo effect.

115558,Folding and binding energy of a calmodulin-binding cell antiproliferative peptide.,2015,"PURPOSE Previous studies have shown an overall decreased risk of second cancers among prostate cancer survivors, but this has not been comprehensively examined by race/ethnicity. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 716,319 one-year survivors of prostate cancer diagnosed at ages 35-84 during 2000-2015 as reported to 17 US Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registries. METHODS We estimated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for second primary non-prostate malignancies by race/ethnicity (non-Latino white, Black, Asian/Pacific Islander [API] and Latino), by Gleason, and by time since prostate cancer diagnosis. Poisson regression models were used to test heterogeneity between groups with the expected number as the offset. RESULTS 60,707 second primary malignancies were observed. SIRs for all second cancers combined varied significantly by race/ethnicity: SIRwhite: 0.88 (95% confidence interval: 0.87-0.89), SIRLatino: 0.92 (0.89-0.95), SIRBlack: 0.97 (0.95-0.99), and SIRAPI: 1.05 (1.01-1.09) (p-heterogeneity < 0.001). SIRs for all cancers combined were higher among survivors of higher vs. lower Gleason prostate cancers irrespective of race/ethnicity. We observed significant heterogeneity by race/ethnicity in SIRs for 9 of 14 second cancer types investigated including lung, bladder, kidney, and liver. CONCLUSIONS Our results confirm that most prostate cancer survivors have lower risks of second cancers than expected, but the magnitude varied by race/ethnicity. Exceptionally, API men had small but significantly increased risk. Further research to understand drivers of the observed race/ethnicity heterogeneity is warranted.","Withrow, Diana R; Schonfeld, Sara J; Curtis, Rochelle E; Morton, Lindsay M; Cook, Michael B; Butler, Eboneé N; Berrington de González, Amy",Cancer causes & control : CCC,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10552-020-01336-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839916/,52
115576,Emerging Concepts. New Article Category in Molecular Pharmacology.,2020-08-06,"INTRODUCTION In 2016, low-and-middle income countries (LMICs) accounted for 79% of the global suicide deaths. In LMICs, vulnerable groups-women, sexual minorities and refugees, and internally displaced persons (IDPs)-are at high risk of suicidal ideation, attempts and deaths by suicide, but information for designing targeted interventions for them is fragmented and missing, making it difficult to address gaps in the existing system. This review highlights these gaps by mapping: (a) risk factors associated with suicides and suicidal behavior including challenges in implementing targeted programmes for vulnerable groups; and (b) recommendations for effective suicide prevention interventions and strategies in LMICs as documented in the literature. METHODS A descriptive mapping review of literature was conducted. Three electronic databases-PubMed, Google Scholar, and Refworld-were searched for specific keywords. The researchers mapped and reviewed 34 studies on suicide and suicide prevention across three main vulnerable groups. RESULTS This review highlighted the need for gender-specific interventions for women and sexual minorities, addressing gender-based discrimination, access to healthcare, abuse and violence, while for refugees and IDPs, critical concerns are monitoring and understanding suicidal behaviors and to address psychological and emotional responses to resettlement. CONCLUSION In LMICs, specific and unique socio-cultural and environmental factors may increase the risk of vulnerable groups to suicidal behaviors. In order to develop effective and comprehensive suicide prevention strategies, it is crucial to evaluate these differential risk factors and develop culturally appropriate and sensitive interventions and strategies.","Vijayakumar, Lakshmi; Ray, Somidha; Fernandes, Tanya Nicole; Pathare, Soumitra",Asia-Pacific psychiatry : official journal of the Pacific Rim College of Psychiatrists,https://doi.org/10.1111/appy.12472; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33817993/,52
115595,The novel target：exosoms derived from M2 macrophage.,2020-08-12,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic ventral rectopexy (LVR) is an established technique for the treatment of rectal prolapse. Several techniques and devices can be used for proximal mesh fixation on the sacral promontory during this procedure. The aim of this study was to compare the fixation strength of a recently introduced screw for mesh fixation on the promontory during LVR with two other frequently used techniques. METHODS An ex vivo experimental model using a porcine spinal column was designed to measure the strength of proximal mesh fixation. In a laparoscopic box trainer, a polypropylene mesh was anchored on the spinal column using three different fixation methods, i.e., the Protack 5-mm tacker device, Ethibond Excel 2-0 stitches, and the Karl Storz screw. Subsequently, increasing traction was applied to the mesh. This traction was applied at a standardized angle as determined by measuring the mean angle between the site of distal mesh fixation on the rectum and a line straight through the sacral promontory on 12 random dynamic MR scans of the pelvic floor after the LVR procedure. The applied force was measured at the moment that the fixation broke, using a calibrated electronic Newton meter. All fixation methods were tested ten times. RESULTS The mean angle, as measured on the MR scans, was 100°. The mean disruption force, which led to a break of the proximal mesh fixation, was 58 N for the three Protack tacks, 55 N for the two stitches, and 70 N for the new screw. The use of a screw therefore led to a significantly stronger fixation compared to the use of stitches (p ≤ 0.05). No significant difference was determined between the tacks and the screw fixation and between the tacks and the stitches fixation. CONCLUSION The new screw for proximal mesh fixation during LVR procedures offers similar fixation strength when compared to tacks. The use of one screw for proximal mesh fixation is therefore a reasonable alternative to the use of several tacks or sutures.","Formijne Jonkers, Hendrik A; van de Haar, Harm J; Draaisma, Werner A; Heggelman, Ben G F; Consten, Esther C J; Broeders, Ivo A M J",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2161-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22302535/,52

OBJECTIVE Our goal was to determine the association of air pollution exposures during adulthood, including distance to road, particulate matter<2.5 μm, between 2.5 and 10 μm, and <10 μm, (PM2.5, PM10-2.5, PM10), and timing of exposure with risk of endometriosis in the Nurses' Health Study II. METHODS Proximity to major roadways and outdoor levels of PM2.5, PM10-2.5, and PM10 were determined for all residential addresses from 1993 to 2007. Multivariable-adjusted time-varying Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the relation between these air pollution exposures and endometriosis risk. RESULTS Among 84,060 women, 2,486 incident cases of surgically confirmed endometriosis were identified over 710,230 person-years of follow-up. There was no evidence of an association between endometriosis risk and distance to road or exposure to PM2.5, PM10-2.5, or PM10 averaged over follow-up or during the previous 2- or 4-year period. CONCLUSIONS Traffic and air pollution exposures during adulthood were not associated with incident endometriosis in this cohort of women.","Mahalingaiah, Shruthi; Hart, Jaime E; Laden, Francine; Aschengrau, Ann; Missmer, Stacey A",Environmental health perspectives,https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1306627; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24225723/,52

The depth of the swab to the nasopharynx coupled with breakpoints along the shaft leads to a risk for foreign body retention. Here, we present a case of a nasopharyngeal swab that became a retained foreign body during routine swabbing to test for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Bedside flexible fiberoptic endoscopy was performed and did not reveal a foreign body in the nasopharynx or larynx. Subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated the radiopaque retained foreign body at the distal gastroesophageal junction. The patient remained asymptomatic and did not have any upper airway or gastrointestinal symptoms. This unique case demonstrates a potential risk associated with SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab testing and highlights management strategies that serve the patient while adequately protecting health care providers. A standardized approach to evaluation optimally includes bedside flexible endoscopy with appropriate personal protective equipment, prompt airway evaluation if aspiration is suspected, and noncontrasted CT imaging if the known foreign body is not identified via other modalities.","Stevens, Madelyn N; Lin, George T; Tittman, Sarah M; Motz, Kevin M","Ear, nose, & throat journal",https://doi.org/10.1177/0145561321996836; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33616412/,52
117521,FUTURE POTENTIAL OF RAPID ACCELERATION OF DIAGNOSTICS (RADx TECH) IN MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTICS.,2021-03-02,"BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE Hemorrhagic, symptomatic cavernous malformations in the brainstem are difficult to access. Conventional approaches such as the transpetrosal approach often require significant brain retraction. We present the successful purely endoscopic, endonasal, transclival resection of a symptomatic cavernoma located in the ventromedial pons. CLINICAL PRESENTATION A 17-year-old male patient presented with acute onset of headache, facial numbness, and tingling. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an enhancing lesion in the pons consistent with a cavernous malformation. Over the course of the next 3 weeks, the patient had 2 additional episodes of acutely worsening neurological deficits that left him with left-sided hemiparesis, a right sixth nerve palsy, and dysphagia. A purely endoscopic, endonasal, transclival approach was used to resect the cavernoma. Postoperatively, he had a transient worsening of his left-side motor function and restricted horizontal gaze, but at the last follow-up, his hemiparesis had improved and his magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a radiographic cure. He developed a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak despite prophylactic lumbar CSF drainage for 2 days and the use of bilateral vascularized nasoseptal flaps. The CSF leak was repaired with CSF diversion and a second surgical procedure; at the last follow-up, he had no recurrence of the leak. CONCLUSION An endoscopic, endonasal, transclival approach is a novel and effective approach to cavernous malformations presenting to the ventral surface of the pons. Recently developed techniques for closure and repair of the skull base defect have minimized but have not eliminated the risk of CSF leak in these procedures.","Sanborn, Matthew R; Kramarz, Michael J; Storm, Philip B; Adappa, Nithin D; Palmer, James N; Lee, John Y K",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1227/neu.0b013e318259e323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22572676/,52

The disease has now reached the level of a global pandemic and as a result a more rapid and simple detection method is imperative to curb the spread of the virus. We aimed to develop a visual diagnostic platform for SARS-CoV-2 based on colorimetric RT-LAMP with levels of sensitivity and specificity comparable to that of commercial qRT-PCR assays. In this work, the primers were designed to target a conserved region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (RdRp). The assay was characterized for its sensitivity and specificity, and validated with clinical specimens collected in Thailand. The developed colorimetric RT-LAMP assay could amplify the target gene and enabled visual interpretation in 60 min at 65 °C. No cross-reactivity with six other common human respiratory viruses (influenza A virus subtypes H1 and H3, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus types A and B, and human metapneumovirus) and five other human coronaviruses (MERS-CoV, HKU-1, OC43, 229E and NL63) was observed. The limit of detection was 25 copies per reaction when evaluated with contrived specimens. However, the detection rate at this concentration fell to 95.8% when the incubation time was reduced from 60 to 30 min. The diagnostic performance of the developed RT-LAMP assay was evaluated in 2120 clinical specimens and compared with the commercial qRT-PCR. The results revealed high sensitivity and specificity of 95.74% and 99.95%, respectively. The overall accuracy of the RT-LAMP assay was determined to be 99.86%. In summary, our results indicate that the developed colorimetric RT-LAMP provides a simple, sensitive and reliable approach for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples, implying its beneficial use as a diagnostic platform for COVID-19 screening.","Nawattanapaiboon, Kawin; Pasomsub, Ekawat; Prombun, Photchanathorn; Wongbunmak, Akanit; Jenjitwanich, Akarawit; Mahasupachai, Pantanat; Vetcho, Purichaya; Chayrach, Cholticha; Manatjaroenlap, Natthapon; Samphaongern, Chonchanok; Watthanachockchai, Treewat; Leedorkmai, Phonthanat; Manopwisedjaroen, Suwimon; Akkarawongsapat, Radeekorn; Thitithanyanont, Arunee; Phanchana, Matthew; Panbangred, Watanalai; Chauvatcharin, Somchai; Srikhirin, Toemsak",The Analyst,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0an01775b; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33165486/,52

117784,Molecular pathogenesis of the hyaluronic acid capsule of Pasteurella multocida.,2020-07-06,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopy is currently the gold standard for cholecystectomy. Recent literature suggests surgical trainees have limited exposure to open cholecystectomy, which may result in suboptimal performance in the event of conversion. Furthermore, most training and assessment models are designed for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, with limited opportunities for open simulator training. The present study's purpose was to design an inexpensive model for open cholecystectomy and to validate a performance assessment tool. METHODS The simulator comprises a porcine liver and gallbladder in a mock human abdomen with silicon skin. The assessment tool utilizes inexpensive infrared (IR) cameras to provide tracking of participant hand motions. Eleven novice general surgery trainees (<20 cholecystectomies) and five expert surgeons (>100 cholecystectomies) completed an open cholecystectomy using the simulator. Procedures were recorded and assessed by a blinded evaluator using a global rating scale. Tracking data analysis was based on number of movements and total path length. RESULTS Novices (t = 36.18 min) completed the procedure significantly slower than did experts (t = 19.53 min) (Mann-Whitney test U = 20, p < 0.05) and had significantly more hand movements (Mann-Whitney test U = 20, p < 0.05). Analysis of the total global rating scale scores showed a significant difference between novice (14/35) and expert (24/35) performance in all categories (Mann-Whitney test U = 58, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION The present model presents a realistic, low-cost tool for training and assessment of procedural skills in open cholecystectomy. The study demonstrated the validity of the IR tracking device as an objective assessment tool for open surgical skills training. Future training should incorporate this low-cost, highly effective training device into surgical curricula.","Rittenhouse, Neil; Sharma, Bharat; Sonnadara, Ranil; Mihailidis, Alex; Grantcharov, Teodor",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-3247-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24149852/,52

There have been several outbreaks of epidemic ocular infections in ophthalmology clinics worldwide with reports of viral, parasitic and prion disease. Contact pachymetry is a possible vehicle of transmission due to its risk of contamination. We aim to identify the types of pachymetry used and methods employed for cleaning and disinfection in eye units throughout the United Kingdom (UK). METHODS A telephone survey was carried out, and a senior nurse or sister questioned based on the proforma created. A follow-up email was sent to units that did not respond with the questionnaire attached. RESULTS Of 109 responses, 10 eye units were unaware of the device name and 4 were unaware of the cleaning method used. 69/105 (66%) were cleaned with some form of alcohol wipe between patients, 12/105 (11%) used presept solution to soak the pachymetry head mainly 5-10 minutes, with 2 units soaking for 20-30 minutes. Milton solution was used by 4 units (4%) (10s to 10▒min). 3 used H2O2 solution for 10 minutes (3%). 3 (3%) used an alcohol solution. 15 (14%) units used some chlorine-based solution (actichlor/choraprep) for 5-10 minutes. 2 (2%) units combined an alcohol-based wipe with solution to soak afterward. CONCLUSIONS There is a large variation in methods and duration of tip disinfection with only a few units following the RCOphth guidelines on pachymeter disinfection. The majority of eye units use alcohol/chlorine-based wipes for cleaning the pachymetry heads which is against the current recommended guidelines. The average immersion time when solutions were used was 5-10 minutes.","Jasani, Kirti M; Barua, Ankur; Putri, Christine; Mercieca, Karl; Sattar, Nayeem; Sanghrajka, Anmol; Bhargava, Archana",Journal of glaucoma,https://doi.org/10.1097/ijg.0000000000001525; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32341320/,52
118152,Thiourea-Derived Chelating Ligands and Their Organometallic Compounds: Investigations into Their Anticancer Activity.,2020-08-11,"BACKGROUND Many countries have already gone through several infection waves and mostly managed to successfully stop the exponential spread of SARS-CoV-2 through bundles of restrictive measures. Still, the danger of further waves of infections is omnipresent, and it is apparent that every containment policy must be carefully evaluated and possibly replaced by a different, less restrictive policy before it can be lifted. Tracing of contacts and consequential breaking of infection chains is a promising strategy to help contain the disease, although its precise impact on the epidemic is unknown. OBJECTIVE In this work, we aim to quantify the impact of tracing on the containment of the disease and investigate the dynamic effects involved. DESIGN We developed an agent-based model that validly depicts the spread of the disease and allows for exploratory analysis of containment policies. We applied this model to quantify the impact of different approaches of contact tracing in Austria to derive general conclusions on contract tracing. RESULTS The study displays that strict tracing complements other intervention strategies. For the containment of the disease, the number of secondary infections must be reduced by about 75%. Implementing the proposed tracing strategy supplements measures worth about 5%. Evaluation of the number of preventively quarantined persons shows that household quarantine is the most effective in terms of avoided cases per quarantined person. LIMITATIONS The results are limited by the validity of the modeling assumptions, model parameter estimates, and the quality of the parametrization data. CONCLUSIONS The study shows that tracing is indeed an efficient measure to keep case numbers low but comes at a high price if the disease is not well contained. Therefore, contact tracing must be executed strictly, and adherence within the population must be held up to prevent uncontrolled outbreaks of the disease.","Bicher, Martin; Rippinger, Claire; Urach, Christoph; Brunmeir, Dominik; Siebert, Uwe; Popper, Niki",Medical decision making : an international journal of the Society for Medical Decision Making,https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x211013306; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34027734/,52

Potential reasons can be attributed to aspects of external validity. The aim of this study is to investigate issues related to the external validity of the INSECT trial. METHODS All participating surgical departments were categorized and the clinical and baseline characteristics of randomized patients were evaluated. In addition, demographic and clinical data of all screened and randomized patients at the Departments of Surgery in Heidelberg and Erlangen were analyzed. RESULTS Twenty-five centers enrolled a total of 625 patients. These centers included eight primary, 11 secondary, and six tertiary care centers. The tertiary care centers enrolled the most patients (n = 237, 38%) followed by the primary care centers (n = 199, 32%) and the secondary care centers (n = 189 patients; 30%). The mean number and baseline data of randomized patients did not differ between the three types of care centers (p = 0.09). Overall, the treatment according to protocol was at least 92%. At the Department of Surgery, University of Heidelberg, 307 patients were screened and 60 out of 130 eligible patients were randomized. There were no differences in demographic and clinical baseline data between included and non-included patients. In Erlangen, 351 patients were screened and 57 out of 106 eligible patients randomized.

120386,Discovery of a novel bottlenose dolphin coronavirus reveals a distinct species of marine mammal coronavirus in Gammacoronavirus.,2014,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the ability of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to inhibit in vitro viral replication and gene expression of feline coronavirus (FCoV). SAMPLE Cell cultures of Crandell-Rees feline kidney cells. PROCEDURES 5 synthetic siRNAs that each targeted a different region of the FCoV genome were tested individually and in various combinations for their antiviral effects against 2 strains of FCoV (feline infectious peritonitis virus WSU 79-1146 and feline enteric coronavirus WSU 79-1683) in cell cultures. Tested combinations targeted the FCoV leader and 3' untranslated region, FCoV leader region and nucleocapsid gene, and FCoV leader region, 3' untranslated region, and nucleocapsid gene. For each test condition, assessments included relative quantification of the inhibition of intracellular viral genomic RNA synthesis by means of real-time, reverse-transcription PCR analysis; flow cytometric evaluation of the reduction of viral protein expression in infected cells; and assessment of virus replication inhibition via titration of extracellular virus with a TCID₅₀ infectivity assay. RESULTS The 5 siRNAs had variable inhibitory effects on FCoV when used singly. Combinations of siRNAs that targeted different regions of the viral genome resulted in more effective viral inhibition than did individual siRNAs that targeted a single gene. The tested siRNA combinations resulted in approximately 95% reduction in viral replication (based on virus titration results), compared with findings in negative control, nontargeting siRNA-treated, FCoV-infected cells. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE In vitro replication of FCoV was specifically inhibited by siRNAs that targeted coding and noncoding regions of the viral genome, suggesting a potential therapeutic application of RNA interference in treatment of feline infectious peritonitis.","Anis, Eman A; Wilkes, Rebecca P; Kania, Stephen A; Legendre, Alfred M; Kennedy, Melissa A",American journal of veterinary research,https://doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.75.9.828; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25157886/,52

Healthcare workers (HCWs) provide the first line of defense against any disease outbreak. Thus, the present study is designed to assess HCWs' attitudes towards, knowledge of, and awareness of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS A cross-sectional observational study was conducted using an online survey on social media; the participants were 597 adults. The study was conducted from March to April 2020. The questionnaire was randomly administered on Arabic-language social media applications; the 26-item survey assessed knowledge levels, attitudes, and practices. RESULTS The analysis includes 597 complete responses from HCWs; participants included physicians, nurses, medical students, and pharmacists. Most participants were females aged 18 to 25 years. Most participants agreed that the virus can spread via direct and indirect contact. Most participants indicated that they wash their hands; avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth; and avoid crowded places to protect themselves against infection. Most indicated that a bat was the original source of the virus. Most participating HCWs indicated that the symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Most of the participants also indicated that there is no specific treatment for patients infected with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this work can support the design of effective measures to prevent and control COVID-19 infections during the pandemic. The results also highlight where improvement is needed to HCWs' knowledge of and attitudes towards COVID-19; the findings also highlight the best healthcare practices regarding this illness.","Bashir, S; Alsultan, F; Iqbal, M; Alabdulkarim, N; Alammari, K; Almousa, A; Alsultan, A; Almousa, B; Albaradie, R; Mir, A; Al-Regaiey, K; Habib, S S; Abualait, T",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202101_24676; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33577062/,52
120543,Novel Vaccine Technologies: Essential Components of an Adequate Response to Emerging Viral Diseases.,2018,"BACKGROUND Single-port access offers cosmetic advantages in addition to the well-recognized benefits of standard multiport laparoscopic surgery, and can be performed with the use of standard straight instruments. We describe a technique of single-port access reversal of Hartmann colostomy by use of the colostomy site for access. METHODS After routine skin preparation and laparoscopic setup, the colostomy is mobilized from its mucocutaneous border, and the anvil of a circular stapler is secured to the distal lumen. By the use of a GelPoint system with 3 or 4 trocars, the intra-abdominal adhesions are divided and the splenic flexure is mobilized to achieve sufficient access to the abdominal and pelvic cavities and proximal colonic mobility. The rectal stump is mobilized to the mid rectum, starting from the posterior mesorectal fascia around to the anterior rectal wall. A tension-free colorectal anastomosis is secured with a standard circular stapling device inserted transanally, and leak tested. The colostomy wound is closed in standard fashion. RESULTS Five patients underwent single-port access reversal of Hartmann resection (4 diverticular perforations and 1 pT3N0 colon cancer), with a mean operating time of 155 (range, 137-187) minutes and a median length of stay of 3 (range, 2-11) days. There were no conversions, major surgical morbidity, or deaths. CONCLUSION Single-port access reversal of Hartmann colostomy through the stoma site is safe, and it offers additional cosmetic advantages with no apparent additional morbidity in comparison with standard multiport surgery.","Borowski, D W; Kanakala, V; Agarwal, A K; Tabaqchali, M A; Garg, D K; Gill, T S",Diseases of the colon and rectum,https://doi.org/10.1097/dcr.0b013e318221aa13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21730797/,52

120656,Flexible Synthetic Carbohydrate Receptors as Inhibitors of Viral Attachment.,2020-10-23,"INTRODUCTION 21% of NHS staff are from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds yet account for a disproportionately high number of medical-staff deaths from COVID-19. Using data from the published OpenSAFELY Collaborative, we analysed consultant physicians to determine those at increased risk of COVID-19 related death. METHODS Data from 13,500 consultant physicians collected by the Royal College of Physicians were analysed to determine those at an increased risk of death from COVID-19, assuming no comorbidities. RESULTS The data reveal a picture in which a third of consultant physicians have a hazard ratio (HR) >1 for dying from COVID-19; one in five have HR >2; one in 11, HR >3; and one in 40, HR >4. Of concern are the risks to male physicians aged ≥60 with HR >3.8. Sub-specialties including cardiology, endocrine and diabetes, gastroenterology, haematology, neurology and rheumatology have a greater risk profile due to high proportion of men, physicians of older age, and proportion of BAME individuals. CONCLUSION A third of consultant physicians have an increased risk of a COVID-19-related death, and one in five have a higher relative risk (HR >2). The risk is mainly driven by age, gender, and ethnicity, the risk is highest in male consultant physicians over 60, especially from BAME backgrounds.","Verma, Ajay M; Goddard, Andrew F; O'Donoghue, Donal; Newbery, Nina; Phillips, Christopher; Trudgill, Nigel",Clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.7861/clinmed.2020-0756; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33541909/,52

However, what has been overlooked is the effect the opioid crisis may be having on a three-decade suicide crisis among American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) communities that already have too few resources to address behavioral and mental health issues. This paper describes recent epidemiological trends associated with both opioid overdose and suicide at a national level for AIANs and the rest of the United States. We used data reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to report historical trends of opioid overdose and suicide for AIAN and non-AIAN populations. We found alarming and potentially correlated trends of opioid use and suicidality among AIAN populations. We highlight both current and future research that will be essential to understanding and addressing the unique intersection between opioid and suicide risk and protective factors to inform dual prevention and intervention efforts among AIAN populations with potential relevance to public health response among other at-risk populations.","Ivanich, Jerreed D; Weckstein, Julia; Nestadt, Paul S; Cwik, Mary F; Walls, Melissa; Haroz, Emily E; O'Keefe, Victoria M; Goklish, Novalene; Barlow, Allison",The American journal of drug and alcohol abuse,https://doi.org/10.1080/00952990.2021.1955895; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34374620/,52

METHODS Among 856 consecutive patients who underwent carotid artery stenting from May 2002 to January 2008, 41 patients had a significant ISR (>80% stenosis). Of these, 9 patients (7 women; mean age 78.1±5.6 years) had recurrent ISR despite multiple endovascular treatments (3.4±0.9 interventions) within a short period of time (2-5 months). These patients were treated with drug-eluting balloon (DEB) angioplasty for neointimal hyperplasia. Imaging (ultrasound or computed tomographic angiography) was performed at 1, 3, and 6 months and yearly thereafter. RESULTS Technical success was obtained in 100% of cases, with angiographic stenosis decreasing from 87%±4% to 6%±4% post treatment. Peak systolic velocity decreased significantly from 4.7±1.5 m/s to 0.6.±0.3 m/s after the procedure. Over a mean follow-up of 36.6±2.7 months, ultrasound imaging indicated recurrent ISR in only 3 patients at 18, 25, and 32 months after DEB angioplasty, respectively. The target vessel revascularization rate was 33.3% at 36 months. No neurological or myocardial events were recorded during follow-up. One patient died at 3 months. CONCLUSION DEB may have a potential role improving outcomes of those patients treated for early recurrent carotid ISR.","Gandini, Roberto; Del Giudice, Costantino; Da Ros, Valerio; Sallustio, Fabrizio; Altobelli, Simone; D'Onofrio, Adolfo; Abrignani, Sergio; Vasili, Erald; Stanzione, Paolo; Simonetti, Giovanni",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1583/14-4715mr.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25290795/,52

This makes DENTECT the first system that focuses on identification of multiple dental treatments; namely periapical lesion therapy, fillings, root canal treatment (RCT), surgical extraction, and conventional extraction all of which are accurately located within their corresponding borders and tooth numbers. Although DENTECT is trained on only 1005 images, the annotations supplied by experts provide satisfactory results for both treatment and enumeration detection. This framework carries out enumeration with an average precision (AP) score of 89.4% and performs treatment identification with a 59.0% AP score. Clinically, DENTECT is a practical and adoptable tool that accelerates the process of treatment planning with a level of accuracy which could compete with that of dental clinicians.","Yüksel, Atıf Emre; Gültekin, Sadullah; Simsar, Enis; Özdemir, Şerife Damla; Gündoğar, Mustafa; Tokgöz, Salih Barkın; Hamamcı, İbrahim Ethem",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-90386-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34117279/,52
121901,Bulked segregant analysis reveals candidate genes responsible for dwarf formation in woody oilseed crop castor bean.,2021-03-18,"Grazing effects on soil properties under different soil and environmental conditions across the globe are often controversial. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the overall magnitude and direction of the grazing effects on soils. This global meta-analysis was conducted using the mixed model method to address the overall effects of grazing intensities (heavy, moderate, and light) on 15 soil properties based on 287 papers published globally from 2007 to 2019. Our findings showed that heavy grazing significantly increased the soil BD (11.3% relative un-grazing) and PR (52.5%) and reduced SOC (-10.8%), WC (-10.8%), NO3- (-23.5%), and MBC (-27.9%) at 0-10 cm depth, and reduced SOC (-22.5%) and TN (-19.9%) at 10-30 cm depth. Moderate grazing significantly increased the BD (7.5%), PR (46.0%), and P (18.9%) (0-10 cm), and increased pH (4.1%) and decreased SOC (-16.4%), TN (-10.6%), and P (-23.9%) (10-30 cm). Light grazing significantly increased the SOC (10.8%) and NH4+ (28.7%) (0-10 cm). Heavy grazing showed much higher mean probability (0.70) leading to overgrazing than the moderate (0.14) and light (0.10) grazing. These findings indicate that, globally, compared to un-grazing, heavy grazing significantly increased soil compaction and reduced SOC, NO3-, and soil moisture. Moderate grazing significantly increased soil compaction and alkalinity and reduced SOC and TN. Light grazing significantly increased SOC and NH4+. Cattle grazing impacts on soil compaction, SOC, TN, and available K were higher than sheep grazing, but lower for PR. Climate significantly impacted grazing effects on SOM, TN, available P, NH4+, EC, CEC, and PR. Heavy grazing can be more detrimental to soil quality based on BD, SOC, TN, C: N, WC, and K than moderate and light grazing. However, global grazing intensities did not significantly impact most of the 15 soil properties, and the grazing effects on them had insignificant changes over the years.","Lai, Liming; Kumar, Sandeep",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236638; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764754/,52
122021,T807-modified Human Serum Albumin Biomimetic Nanoparticles for Targeted Drug Delivery across the Blood-Brain Barrier.,2020-07-02,"BACKGROUND Stenosis of the gastrojejunostomy after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is a common occurrence. We have previously presented data demonstrating that the use of a 25-mm circular stapler results in a decreased incidence of stenosis compared to the results of a 21-mm circular stapler (6.2 vs. 15.9%, P=0.03). One potential drawback of the larger-diameter stapler is the possibility for impaired long-term weight loss due to decreased restriction. We sought to determine the impact of circular stapler diameter on excess weight loss up to 5 years after surgery. METHODS Our initial technique for creating the gastrojejunostomy after laparoscopic gastric bypass involved the transgastric passage of a 21-mm circular stapler anvil (group 1). After a large initial experience, we switched to a 25-mm circular stapler (group 2). Follow-up data were entered prospectively into a computer database. Weight loss was recorded as percent of excess weight lost. Only patients with follow-up beyond 3 years postoperatively were eligible for inclusion. RESULTS Group 1 consisted of 145 consecutive patients and group 2 consisted of 116 consecutive patients. There was no significant difference in weight loss between the groups at 3 (66.1 vs. 65.2%, P=0.76, n=134), 4 (66.4 vs. 58.6%, P=0.1, n=66), and 5 years after gastric bypass (62.7 vs. 57.5%, P=0.24, n=75). CONCLUSIONS The use of a 25-mm circular stapler in laparoscopic gastric bypass operations instead of a 21-mm stapler does not result in significantly different long-term weight loss. The 25-mm stapler is preferred with our technique.","Smith, Carter; Garren, Michael; Gould, Jon",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1516-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21184107/,52

METHODS Temperature data between April 1995 and June 2008 were collected from 588 patients and analyzed in a retrospective cohort study by observers blinded to outcome. The time needed to achieve an esophageal temperature of less than 34°C was recorded. Survival and neurological outcomes were determined within six months after cardiac arrest. RESULTS The median time from restoration of spontaneous circulation to reaching a temperature of less than 34°C was 209 minutes (interquartile range [IQR]: 130-302) in patients with favorable neurological outcomes compared to 158 min (IQR: 101-230) (P < 0.01) in patients with unfavorable neurological outcomes. The adjusted odds ratio for a favorable neurological outcome with a longer time to target temperature was 1.86 (95% CI 1.03 to 3.38, P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS In comatose cardiac arrest patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia after return of spontaneous circulation, a faster decline in body temperature to the 34°C target appears to predict an unfavorable neurologic outcome.","Haugk, Moritz; Testori, Christoph; Sterz, Fritz; Uranitsch, Maximilian; Holzer, Michael; Behringer, Wilhelm; Herkner, Harald",Critical care,https://doi.org/10.1186/cc10116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21439038/,52

122438,Selenium Deficiency via the TLR4/TRIF/NF-κB Signaling Pathway Leading to Inflammatory Injury in Chicken Spleen.,2020-05-09,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Carotid webs may cause recurrent ischemic stroke. We describe the prevalence, demographics, clinical presentation, imaging features, histopathology, and stroke risk associated with this under-recognized lesion. MATERIALS AND METHODS A carotid web was defined on CTA as a thin intraluminal filling defect along the posterior wall of the carotid bulb just beyond the carotid bifurcation on oblique sagittal section CTA that was seen as a septum on axial CTA. Using a prospective case series from April 2013 to April 2014, we describe the demographics, spectrum of imaging features on CTA, and histopathology of these carotid webs. From a retrospective analysis of patients at our center from May 2012 to April 2013 who had a baseline head and neck CTA followed by a brain MR imaging within 1-2 days of the CTA, we determine the period prevalence of carotid webs and the prevalence of ipsilateral stroke on imaging. RESULTS In the prospective series, the mean age was 50 years (range, 41-55 years); 5/7 patients were women. Recurrent stroke was seen in 5/7 (71.4%) patients with the carotid web; time to recurrence ranged from 1 to 97 months. Histopathology suggested a high probability of fibromuscular dysplasia. In the retrospective series, carotid webs were seen in 7/576 patients for a hospital-based-period prevalence of 1.2% (95% CI, 0.4%-2.5%). Two of these 7 patients had acute stroke in the vascular territory of the carotid web. CONCLUSIONS A carotid web may contribute to recurrent ischemic stroke in patients with no other determined stroke mechanism. Intimal variant fibromuscular dysplasia is the pathologic diagnosis in most cases. The prevalence of carotid web is low, while the optimal management strategy remains unknown.","Choi, P M C; Singh, D; Trivedi, A; Qazi, E; George, D; Wong, J; Demchuk, A M; Goyal, M; Hill, M D; Menon, B K",AJNR.

However, resistance poses substantial clinical challenges. METHODS We conducted a phase I trial of CD40 agonist APX005M (sotigalimab) and CSF1R inhibitor cabiralizumab with/without nivolumab using a 3+3 dose escalation design (NCT03502330). Patients were enrolled from June 2018-April 2019. Eligibility included biopsy-proven advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), or renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients who progressed on anti-PD-1/PD-L1. APX005M was dose escalated (0.03, 0.1, or 0.3 mg/kg IV) with a fixed dose of cabiralizumab with/without nivolumab every 2 weeks until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. RESULTS Twenty-six patients (12 melanoma, 1 NSCLC, and 13 RCC) were enrolled in six cohorts, 17 on nivolumab-containing regimens. Median duration of follow-up was 21.3 months. The most common TRAEs were asymptomatic elevations of LDH (n=26), CK (n=25), AST (n=25), and ALT (n=19); periorbital edema (n=17), and fatigue (n=13). One DLT (acute respiratory distress syndrome) occurred in Cohort 2. RP2D was APX005M 0.3 mg/kg, cabiralizumab 4 mg/kg, and nivolumab 240 mg q2wk. Median days on treatment was 66 (range 23-443). Median cycles was 4.5 (range 2-21). One patient had unconfirmed partial response (4%), 8 stable disease (31%), 16 disease progression (62%), and 1 unevaluable (4%).

DATA SOURCES Three major databases (PubMed, Medline and Cochrane) were searched for original studies written in English. STUDY SELECTION Original articles reporting CV risk factors or non-invasive imaging parameters for patients undergoing bariatric surgery, from January 1950 to June 2012. DATA EXTRACTION Data extraction from selected studies was based on protocol-defined criteria that included study design, methods, patient characteristics, surgical procedures, weight loss, changes in CV risk factors, cardiac structure and cardiac function postoperatively. DATA SYNTHESIS 73 CV risk factor studies involving 19 543 subjects were included (mean age 42 years, 76% female). Baseline prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidaemia were 44%, 24%, and 44%, respectively. Mean follow-up was 57.8 months (range 3-176) and average excess weight loss was 54% (range 16-87%). Postoperative resolution/improvement of hypertension occurred in 63% of subjects, of diabetes in 73% and of hyperlipidaemia in 65%. Echocardiographic data from 713 subjects demonstrated statistically significant improvements in left ventricular mass, E/A ratio, and isovolumic relaxation time postoperatively. LIMITATIONS Diagnostic criteria, CV risk factor reporting, and imaging parameters were not uniform across all studies. Study groups were heterogeneous in their demographics, operative technique and follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review highlights the benefits of bariatric surgery in reducing risk factors for CV disease. There is also evidence for left ventricular hypertrophy regression and improved diastolic function.

However, whether poor cognitive functions and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) traits affect the therapeutic response of patients with OCD to ERP-based CBT remains unclear. This study aimed to identify factors predictive of the therapeutic response of Japanese patients with OCD to ERP-based CBT. METHODS Forty-two Japanese outpatients with OCD were assessed using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III), Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item scale, and Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) at pre- and post-treatment. We used multiple regression analyses to estimate the effect on therapeutic response change. The treatment response change was set as a dependent variable in multiple regression analyses. RESULTS Multiple regression analyses showed that among independent variables, communication as an AQ sub-scale and Letter Number Sequencing as a WAIS-III sub-test predict the therapeutic response to ERP-based CBT . CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that diminished working memory (Letter Number Sequencing), poor communication skill (AQ sub-scale) may undermine responsiveness to ERP-based CBT among patients with OCD.

METHODS We enrolled 242 adolescents undergoing bariatric surgery between March 2007 and February 2012 at 5 tertiary care centers into a multicenter, prospective observational cohort study. Intraoperative core liver biopsies were collected from 165 subjects; 17 were excluded because of insufficient liver tissue or use of hepatotoxic medications, so 148 remained in the study (mean age, 16.8 ± 1.6 years; median body mass index = 52 kg/m(2)). Liver tissues were analyzed by histology using validated criteria. Hepatic gene expression was analyzed in 67 samples. RESULTS NAFLD was present in 59% of this predominantly female (72%), white (68%), non-Hispanic (91%) cohort. Of subjects with NAFLD, 24% had borderline and 10% had definite nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Mild fibrosis (stage 2 or lower) was observed in 18% of liver biopsies and stage 3 was observed in 0.7%, but cirrhosis was not detected. Dyslipidemia was present in 78% of subjects, hypertension in 44%, and diabetes in 14%. More severe NAFLD was associated with increasing levels of alanine aminotransferase, fasting glucose level, hypertension (each P < .01), and white blood cell count (P = .04). Only diabetes was associated with detection of fibrosis (odds ratio = 3.56; 95% confidence interval: 1.93-6.56). Microarray analysis associated presence of NASH with altered expression of genes that regulate macrophage chemotaxis, cholesterol absorption, and fatty acid binding. CONCLUSIONS More than half of adolescents undergoing bariatric surgery in this cohort had NAFLD, yet the prevalence of severe or fibrotic NASH was low. Increasing severity of NAFLD was associated with level of alanine aminotransferase and cardiometabolic risk factors, but not body mass index. Based on gene expression analysis, borderline and definite NASH were associated with abnormal immune function, intestinal cholesterol absorption, and lipid metabolism.","Xanthakos, Stavra A; Jenkins, Todd M; Kleiner, David E; Boyce, Tawny W; Mourya, Reena; Karns, Rebekah; Brandt, Mary L; Harmon, Carroll M; Helmrath, Michael A; Michalsky, Marc P; Courcoulas, Anita P; Zeller, Meg H; Inge, Thomas H",Gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2015.05.039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26026390/,52

METHODS In our retrospective single-center analysis of 176 patients with carotid artery stenting between 2009 and 2015, using duplex ultrasound, we detected 9 patients with high-grade carotid artery in-stent restenosis. All restenosis patients were treated with a drug-eluting balloon (DEB) to prevent recurrent neointimal hyperplasia. One patient had bilateral carotid artery disease with bilateral in-stent restenosis, and 1 patient needed repeated DEB treatment 19 months after the first DEB intervention, so 11 DEB procedures, in total, were performed. RESULTS The median time-interval between primary carotid artery stenting and first DEB-treatment was 9 months. In 3 of the 11 interventions, the DEB treatment was assisted by an additional stent. One repeat DEB treatment was necessary, and three DEB treatments were followed by a secondary stent. No peri-interventional complications (TIA, stroke, or death) were observed during or after DEB intervention. Therefore, in the entire group, the 1y event-free survival (EFS) was 100%, and the 2y/3y/5y EFS was 83%. CONCLUSION DEB intervention seems to be an effective and safe treatment for patients with high-grade in-stent restenosis after SPAC.","Pohlmann, C; Höltje, J; Zeile, M; Bonk, F; Urban, P P; Brüning, R",Neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00234-017-1935-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29058047/,52

The rates of burnout are on the rise. Burnout-associated suicide amongst physicians represents a real ""public health crisis."" This article discusses the drivers of burnout and offers some strategies to mitigate burnout and improve well-being. RECENT FINDINGS Measures of burnout such as stress, micro, and macro-aggression in the workplace have a psychological impact on staff. Additionally, a measurable economic price is exacted when an organization fails to address the lack of well-being burnout represents. SUMMARY As healthcare providers struggle to survive and deal with the complex new set of problems and obstacles that the COVID-19 pandemic, the National economic crisis, and the increasing regulatory obligations have summoned forth, professional burnout rates have risen drastically. With good leadership, developing comprehensive programs to identify, track, and treat burnout symptoms and improve well-being in the work environment can result in greater work satisfaction and save resources.","Janosy, Norah R; Anderson, Corrie T M",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aco.0000000000000969; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33652456/,52

Distributed simulation (DS) is an innovative concept of low-cost, portable and high-fidelity contextualised simulation. However, it has previously only been trialled at a central London teaching hospital. AIMS (1) To explore the off-site feasibility of DS. (2) To determine the response of end-users to DS. METHODS A DS naive researcher recreated a standardised porcine laparoscopic cholecystectomy scenario at a District General Hospital using DS. A research diary detailed the logistical feasibility of the project, whilst mixed methods were used to determine the response of the 10 surgeons who completed the full-team simulation. RESULTS DS is feasible off-site with end-users comparing it favourably to their previous simulation experiences. Surgeons perceived DS as being most useful for building the operative confidence of juniors between learning the basics on a bench top model and before entering the operating theatre. CONCLUSIONS DS has the potential to provide high-fidelity contextualised simulation as an adjunct to, and not a replacement for, surgical training. Unlike other modalities, it is low cost and portable, thereby addressing concerns over affordability and accessibility.","Harris, Alexander; Kassab, Eva; Tun, Jimmy Kyaw; Kneebone, Roger",Medical teacher,https://doi.org/10.3109/0142159x.2012.731095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23137260/,52

METHODS We sent questionnaires to members of JSOG via official email. Participants answered anonymously using Google forms. RESULTS Two (0.08%) JSOG members had contracted COVID-19. There was a clear decrease in the number of patients scheduled for operation, not only for malignant but also for benign diseases. A decrease in the number of outpatients for infertility treatment was also observed. Polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was available in 20.4% of the facilities. Inpatients and outpatients were requested to wear masks, limit the number of contacts and check body temperature when visiting hospitals/clinics. During parturition care, caregivers and physicians wore gloves, masks (other than N-95), face shields and gowns. About 66% and 80% of the facilities decided to transfer pregnant women if they had asymptomatic and symptomatic infection, respectively. Cesarean section was typically chosen as delivery mode in infected women. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic provoked significant changes in obstetrics and gynecology practices in Japan.

Information on this life-threatening pandemic of COVID-19 is sparse and discrete; and the urgency is such that the dissemination of information is increasing with numerous daily publications on the topic. Therefore, we developed a comprehensive review on various aspects of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. We scientifically compiled published research, news, and reports from various sources to comprehend and summarize the information and findings on Coronaviruses. The review explicitly covers the aspects like genome and pedigree of SARS-CoV-2; epidemiology, prognosis, pathogenesis, symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 in order to catalog the right information on transmission route, and influence of environmental factors on virus transmissions, for the robust understanding of right strategical steps for proper COVID-19 management. We have explicitly highlighted several useful information and facts like: i) No established relationship between progression of SARS-CoV-2 with temperature, humidity and/or both, ii) The underlying mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is not fully understood, iii) Respiratory droplet size determines drop and airborne-based transmission, iv) Prognosis of COVID-19 can be done by its effects on various body organs, v) Infection can be stopped by restricting the binding of S protein and AE2, vi) Hydroxychloroquine is believed to be better than chloroquine for COVID-19, vii) Ivermectin with Vero-hSLAM cells is able to reduce infection by ~5000 time within 2 days, and viii) Nafamostat mesylate can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S protein-initiated membrane fusion.

127484,Issues and updates in emerging neurologic viral infections.,2011,"OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to evaluate whether additional cusp interventions and valve types affect aortic valve-related reoperation and mortality rates after the David procedure. METHODS Between 1997 and 2018, a total of 449 patients {372 males; mean age 54.2 [standard deviation (SD) 15.2] years, range: 12.7-79.9 years} underwent elective valve-sparing aortic root replacement (David procedure) for aortic regurgitation and were prospectively followed up clinically and echocardiographically. RESULTS The follow-up was 94% complete. Cumulative follow-up time was 2268 patient-years [mean follow-up time 5.1 (4.3 SD) years]. Thirty-day mortality was 2.2% (n = 10). Late (>30 days) survival did not differ from that of the age- and gender-matched general population. Freedom from reoperation in patients without additional cusp reconstruction was 94% [95% confidence interval (CI) 91-98] and 92% (95% CI 88-97) at 5 and 10 years, respectively, which was not significantly different (P = 1) for patients who did require additional cusp reconstruction 98% (95% CI 95-100) and 89% (95% CI 81-99). In patients with tricuspid aortic valves (n = 338), freedom from reoperation was 96% (95% CI 94-99) and 93% (95% CI 88-97) at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Patients with bicuspid aortic valves (n = 111) had a freedom from reoperation of 94% (95% CI 89-99) at 5 years and 88% (95% CI 79-98) at 10 years (P = 0.021 for the comparison to tricuspid aortic valve). Overall, 23 patients (5%; 1%/patient-year) required reoperation with a mean interval of 4.5 (4.8 SD) months. CONCLUSIONS The David procedure revealed low mid-term reoperation risk and excellent survival independent of adjunctive cusp interventions/valve morphology and is comparable with that of the age- and gender-matched general population.","Liebrich, Markus; Charitos, Efstratios; Stadler, Charlotte; Roser, Detlef; Merk, Denis R; Doll, Nicolas; Hemmer, Wolfgang; Voth, Vladimir",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/ejcts/ezaa149; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408342/,52

Here, we present the successful management of a rare case of spontaneous, noniatrogenic CSF rhinorrhea in a patient with an untreated macroprolactinoma. A 27-year-old man with no significant medical history presented with six months of persistent CSF rhinorrhea, which was confirmed by testing for beta-2-transferrin. He had had decreased libido since adolescence and impaired growth of secondary sexual characteristics. Workup revealed an elevated prolactin level, and imaging demonstrated erosion of the anterior sellar floor and soft tissue within the sphenoid sinus, concerning for tumor. The patient underwent surgical repair of the CSF leak via a transnasal transsphenoidal approach, with resection and biopsy of tumor material within the sinus. No tumor was noted within the sella itself. The patient tolerated the procedure well and had subsequent normalization of his prolactin level with no further CSF egress. Spontaneous noniatrogenic CSF rhinorrhea, although rare, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of invasive pituitary macroadenomas, especially prolactinomas. The mechanism of CSF leak from a prolactinoma is not completely understood, but the CSF leak should be urgently repaired through a transnasal transsphenoidal approach. Concurrently, tumor resection should be performed and a postoperative lumbar puncture or lumbar drain should be considered to reinforce the skull base reconstruction.","Patel, Aneek; Gozal, Yair M; Abou-Al-Shaar, Hussam; Taussky, Philipp; Couldwell, William",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.13111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33728130/,52

While considerable work has described the role of host proteins in invasion, much less is known regarding how natural variation in these invasion-associated host proteins affects Salmonella pathogenesis. Here we leveraged a candidate cellular GWAS screen to identify natural genetic variation in the ARHGEF26 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor 26) gene that renders lymphoblastoid cells susceptible to Salmonella Typhi and Typhimurium invasion. Experimental follow-up redefined ARHGEF26's role in Salmonella epithelial cell infection. Specifically, we identified complex serovar-by-host interactions whereby ARHGEF26 stimulation of S. Typhi and S. Typhimurium invasion into host cells varied in magnitude and effector-dependence based on host cell type. While ARHGEF26 regulated SopB- and SopE-mediated S. Typhi (but not S. Typhimurium) infection of HeLa cells, the largest effect of ARHGEF26 was observed with S. Typhimurium in polarized MDCK cells through a SopB- and SopE2-independent mechanism. In both cell types, knockdown of the ARHGEF26-associated protein DLG1 resulted in a similar phenotype and serovar specificity. Importantly, we show that ARHGEF26 plays a critical role in S. Typhimurium pathogenesis by contributing to bacterial burden in the enteric fever murine model, as well as inflammation in the colitis infection model. In the enteric fever model, SopB and SopE2 are required for the effects of Arhgef26 deletion on bacterial burden, and the impact of sopB and sopE2 deletion in turn required ARHGEF26. In contrast, SopB and SopE2 were not required for the impacts of Arhgef26 deletion on colitis. A role for ARHGEF26 on inflammation was also seen in cells, as knockdown reduced IL-8 production in HeLa cells. Together, these data reveal pleiotropic roles for ARHGEF26 during infection and highlight that many of the interactions that occur during infection that are thought to be well understood likely have underappreciated complexity.","Bourgeois, Jeffrey S; Wang, Liuyang; Rabino, Agustin F; Everitt, Jeffrey; Alvarez, Monica I; Awadia, Sahezeel; Wittchen, Erika S; Garcia-Mata, Rafael; Ko, Dennis C",PLoS pathogens,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009713; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34242364/,52

MATERIALS AND METHODS PREMiSe (Prospective Randomized Endovascular therapy in Multiple Sclerosis) is a venous angioplasty study that enrolled 30 patients with relapsing MS. The patients fulfilled two or more venous hemodynamic extracranial Doppler sonography screening criteria. Phase I of the study included 10 patients and was planned to assess safety and standardize venography, IVUS, and angioplasty and blinding procedures; phase II enrolled 20 patients and further validated diagnostic assessments using the two invasive techniques. Venography was considered abnormal when ≥ 50% lumen-diameter restriction was detected. IVUS was considered abnormal when ≥ 50% lumen-diameter restriction, intraluminal defects, or reduced pulsatility was detected. RESULTS No venography-related or IVUS-related complications, including vessel rupture, thrombosis, or side effects of contrast media were recorded among the 30 study patients. IVUS-detected venous abnormalities, including chronic, organized, thrombus-like inclusions were observed in 85% of azygos, 50% of right IJ, and 83.3% of left IJ veins, whereas venography demonstrated stenosis of ≥ 50% in 50% of azygos, 55% of right IJ, and 72% of left IJ veins. Sensitivity of venography for detecting IVUS abnormalities was 52.9%, 73.3%, and 80% for the azygos, left IJ, and right IJ veins, respectively. CONCLUSIONS IVUS assessment of azygos and IJ veins showed a higher rate of venous abnormalities than venography. IVUS provides a diagnostic advantage over conventional venography in detecting extracranial venous abnormalities indicative of chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency.","Karmon, Yuval; Zivadinov, Robert; Weinstock-Guttman, Bianca; Marr, Karen; Valnarov, Vesela; Dolic, Kresimir; Kennedy, Cheryl L; Hojnacki, David; Carl, Ellen M; Hagemeier, Jesper; Hopkins, L Nelson; Levy, Elad I; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2013.06.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23953830/,52

We performed a systematic review of both clinical and surrogate exposure data comparing N95 respirators and surgical masks for the prevention of transmissible acute respiratory infections. METHODS We searched various electronic databases and the grey literature for relevant studies published from January 1990 to December 2014. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies and case-control studies that included data on health care workers wearing N95 respirators and surgical masks to prevent acute respiratory infections were included in the meta-analysis. Surrogate exposure studies comparing N95 respirators and surgical masks using manikins or adult volunteers under simulated conditions were summarized separately. Outcomes from clinical studies were laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, influenza-like illness and workplace absenteeism. Outcomes from surrogate exposure studies were filter penetration, face-seal leakage and total inward leakage. RESULTS We identified 6 clinical studies (3 RCTs, 1 cohort study and 2 case-control studies) and 23 surrogate exposure studies. In the meta-analysis of the clinical studies, we found no significant difference between N95 respirators and surgical masks in associated risk of (a) laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection (RCTs: odds ratio [OR] 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64-1.24; cohort study: OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.03-6.41; case-control studies: OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.25-3.36); (b) influenza-like illness (RCTs: OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.19-1.41); or (c) reported workplace absenteeism (RCT: OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.57-1.50). In the surrogate exposure studies, N95 respirators were associated with less filter penetration, less face-seal leakage and less total inward leakage under laboratory experimental conditions, compared with surgical masks. INTERPRETATION Although N95 respirators appeared to have a protective advantage over surgical masks in laboratory settings, our meta-analysis showed that there were insufficient data to determine definitively whether N95 respirators are superior to surgical masks in protecting health care workers against transmissible acute respiratory infections in clinical settings.","Smith, Jeffrey D; MacDougall, Colin C; Johnstone, Jennie; Copes, Ray A; Schwartz, Brian; Garber, Gary E",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.150835; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26952529/,52

129856,Entry of antiepileptic drugs (valproate and lamotrigine) into the developing rat brain.,2021,"OBJECTIVE Isotonic saline is the most commonly used crystalloid in the ICU, but recent evidence suggests that balanced fluids like Lactated Ringer's solution may be preferable. We examined the association between choice of crystalloids and in-hospital mortality during the resuscitation of critically ill adults with sepsis. DESIGN A retrospective cohort study of patients admitted with sepsis, not undergoing any surgical procedures, and treated in an ICU by hospital day 2. We used propensity score matching to control for confounding and compared the following outcomes after resuscitation with balanced versus with no-balanced fluids: in-hospital mortality, acute renal failure with and without dialysis, and hospital and ICU lengths of stay. We also estimated the dose-response relationship between receipt of increasing proportions of balanced fluids and in-hospital mortality. SETTING Three hundred sixty U.S. hospitals that were members of the Premier Healthcare alliance between November 2005 and December 2010. PATIENTS A total of 53,448 patients with sepsis, treated with vasopressors and crystalloids in an ICU by hospital day 2 including 3,396 (6.4%) that received balanced fluids. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Patients treated with balanced fluids were younger and less likely to have heart or chronic renal failure, but they were more likely to receive mechanical ventilation, invasive monitoring, colloids, steroids, and larger crystalloid volumes (median 7 vs 5 L). Among 6,730 patients in a propensity-matched cohort, receipt of balanced fluids was associated with lower in-hospital mortality (19.6% vs 22.8%; relative risk, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.78, 0.94). Mortality was progressively lower among patients receiving larger proportions of balanced fluids. There were no significant differences in the prevalence of acute renal failure (with and without dialysis) or in-hospital and ICU lengths of stay. CONCLUSIONS Among critically ill adults with sepsis, resuscitation with balanced fluids was associated with a lower risk of in-hospital mortality. If confirmed in randomized trials, this finding could have significant public health implications, as crystalloid resuscitation is nearly universal in sepsis.","Raghunathan, Karthik; Shaw, Andrew; Nathanson, Brian; Stürmer, Til; Brookhart, Alan; Stefan, Mihaela S; Setoguchi, Soko; Beadles, Chris; Lindenauer, Peter K",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000000305; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24674927/,52

These solutions are unpalatable and a new flavoured pre-packaged solution was developed. METHOD After 8 hours of fasting, 27 patients took 500 ml of the modified WHO cholera solution or Glucodrate® on 2 occasions in a crossover random order and urine and stomal output was collected for 6 hours. RESULTS There was a small but significant difference in net sodium absorption in favour of the modified WHO cholera solution (10±28mmol modified WHO cholera solution vs -1±26mmol Glucodrate®, p=0.01). However the Glucodrate® was more palatable with 24 patients (89%) preferring it to the modified WHO cholera solution (p<0.005). CONCLUSION Glucodrate® is a more palatable solution than the modified WHO cholera solution and is almost as effective so can be used when patients find the modified WHO cholera solution unpalatable.

130359,"Biological and molecular characterization of Aromia bungii (Faldermann, 1835) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), an emerging pest of stone fruits in Europe.",2020-04-28,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease characterized by progressive lung scarring due to unknown injurious stimuli ultimately leading to respiratory failure. Diagnosis is complex and requires a combination of clinical, laboratory, radiological, and histological investigations, along with exclusion of known causes of lung fibrosis. The current understanding of the disease etiology suggests an interaction between genetic factors and epigenetic alterations in susceptible, older individuals. Prognosis is dismal and current treatment options include anti-fibrotic agents that only slow down disease progression and carry considerable side effects that hamper patients' quality of life. Therefore, there is a need for new, more effective treatments, alone or in combination with existing pharmacotherapy. Regenerative medicine, the potential use of cell therapies to treat destructive diseases that cause architectural distortion to the target organ, has also emerged as an alternative therapeutic for lung diseases with unfavorable prognosis such as IPF. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and type II alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2s) have been used and their safety has been demonstrated. In the case of MSCs, both homogenic and allogeneic sources have been used and both are considered viable options without immunosuppressive therapy, taking into consideration the absence of immunogenicity and HLA response. AEC2s have been used in one trial with promising results but their use requires a deceased donor and immunosuppressive pre-treatment. In this review, we briefly summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of IPF, and the background and rationale for using MSCs or AEC2s as potential treatment options. We list and describe the clinical trials completed to date and provide a comparison of their methods and results as well as a possible way forward.","Ntolios, Paschalis; Steiropoulos, Paschalis; Karpathiou, Georgia; Anevlavis, Stavros; Karampitsakos, Theodoros; Bouros, Evangelos; Froudarakis, Marios E; Bouros, Demosthenes; Tzouvelekis, Argyrios","BioDrugs : clinical immunotherapeutics, biopharmaceuticals and gene therapy",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40259-020-00437-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894503/,52

Local water droplet motion has attracted considerable interest and has expanded into various application areas because of its close relationship with processes associated with life. However, few approaches have been capable of independently manipulating local droplet motion without loss on a substrate due to the difficulty in shaping and focusing the motion route. Here, we demonstrate a non-contact electrostatic-powered local water motion strategy. The gradient of electrostatic charges in space guides the local drop motion without liquid loss in a controlled motion path. The local droplet motion on surfaces with varied wettabilities is discussed and compared. A unipolar electrostatic field is theoretically simulated. This work can introduce a finger-directed surface charge pattern and local droplet motion as a new variable in many droplet robot schemes and inspire next-generation liquid devices.","Li, Ning; Yu, Cunlong; Dong, Zhichao; Jiang, Lei",Soft matter,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0sm01073a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084723/,52

Patients access YouTube, one of the largest video databases in the World, to retrieve health-related information increasingly often. OBJECTIVE We aimed to identify high-quality publishers, so-called ""channels"" that can be recommended to patients. We hypothesized that the number of views and the number of uploaded videos were indicators for the quality of the information given by a video on PD. METHODS YouTube was searched for 8 combinations of search terms that included ""Parkinson"" in German. For each term, the first 100 search results were analyzed for source, date of upload, number of views, numbers of likes and dislikes, and comments. The view ratio (views / day) and the likes ratio (likes * 100 / [likes + dislikes]) were determined to calculate the video popularity index (VPI). The global quality score (GQS) and title - content consistency index (TCCI) were assessed in a subset of videos. RESULTS Of 800 search results, 251 videos met the inclusion criteria. The number of views or the publisher category were not indicative of higher quality video content. The number of videos uploaded by a channel was the best indicator for the quality of video content. CONCLUSION The quality of YouTube videos relevant for PD patients is increased in channels with a high number of videos on the topic. We identified three German channels that can be recommended to PD patients who prefer video over written content.","Braczynski, Anne K; Ganse, Bergita; Ridwan, Stephanie; Schlenstedt, Christian; Schulz, Jörg B; Hoog Antink, Christoph",Journal of Parkinson's disease,https://doi.org/10.3233/jpd-202513; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33682733/,52
130615,Discovery of epi-Enprioline as a Novel Drug for the Treatment of Vincristine Resistant Neuroblastoma.,2020-09-08,"OBJECTIVE The mechanism of angioplasty is disruption of atherosclerotic plaque, which often results in dissections. Dissection after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) remains a significant clinical problem and untreated may cause acute occlusion or later restenosis. Stents are used to manage dissections, which is often followed by in-stent restenosis and occasionally stent fracture. Tack (Intact Vascular, Wayne, Pa) implants have minimal metal and low radial force and are specifically designed for dissection repair. This study evaluated Tack implants for treatment of dissections resulting from standard balloon PTA for femoral-popliteal arterial disease. Twelve-month outcomes after Tack treatment of post-PTA dissections are described. METHODS This prospective, single-arm study evaluated patients with ischemia (Rutherford clinical category 2-4) caused by lesions of the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries. Patients were treated with standard balloon angioplasty, and post-PTA dissections were treated with Tacks. The primary end points were core laboratory-adjudicated device technical success, defined as the ability of the Tack implants to resolve post-PTA dissection, and device safety, defined as the absence of new-onset major adverse events. Patients were followed up to 12 months after implantation. RESULTS Tacks were used in 130 patients with post-PTA dissections (74.0% ≥ grade C). Technical success was achieved in 128 (98.5%) patients with no major adverse events at 30 days. The 12-month patency was 76.4%, and freedom from target lesion revascularization was 89.5%. Significant improvement from baseline was observed in Rutherford clinical category (82.8% with grade ≤1) and ankle-brachial index (0.68 ± 0.18 to 0.94 ± 0.15; P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS Tack implant treatment of post-PTA dissection was safe, produced reasonable patency, and resulted in low rates of target lesion revascularization. Tack treatment represents a new, minimal metal paradigm for dissection repair that can safely improve the clinical results associated with PTA.","Bosiers, Marc; Scheinert, Dierk; Hendriks, Jeroen M H; Wissgott, Christian; Peeters, Patrick; Zeller, Thomas; Brodmann, Marianne; Staffa, Robert",Journal of vascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2016.02.043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27139789/,52

AIM To characterize neurological complications in patients admitted due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS Review of medical records of patients aged over 15 years with COVID-19 evaluated by the neurology team between April and August 2020 at a university hospital. Severity of the infection, referral reasons, neurological diagnoses and laboratory results were registered. The diagnoses were defined by consensus among the members of the hospital neurology group. Cerebrovascular and inflammatory diseases of the central and peripheral nervous system were defined as ""probably associated"" or ""possibly associated"" to COVID-19. RESULTS Ninety-six patients had at least 1 new neu- rological complication. 74% were admitted due to pneumonia and 20% due to a neurological disease. The most common reasons for neurological referral were impaired consciousness (39%), focal neurological deficit (24%), headache (9%) and seizures (5%). The most relevant neurological diagnoses were delirium in 48 patients, stroke in 24, critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy in 17, seizures in 14, brachial plexopathy in 3, compressive neuropathies in 5, encephalitis in 1, possible vasculitis in 1 and Guillain-Barré syndrome in 1. Stroke and epilepsy were associated with increased length of hospital stay, but without differences in mortality. CONCLUSIONS The spectrum of neurological complications of COVID-19 is wide. There are clinical entities typical of critically ill patients and also diseases associated directly and indirectly with the SARS-CoV2 infection.","Godoy-Santín, Jaime; Bravo-Grau, Sebastián; Nuñez, Felipe; Aguilar, Cecilia; Gutiérrez, Diego; Miranda, Héctor; Sandoval-Rubio, Patricio; Ramos, Bernardita; García A, Lorena; Andresen, Max; Mellado, Patricio",Revista medica de Chile,https://doi.org/10.4067/s0034-98872021000400527; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34479340/,52

MATERIALS AND METHODS Consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic-ELAPE with primary suturing for low rectal cancer at our institution between September 2013 and January 2015 were retrospectively identified from a prospectively maintained database. Short-term outcomes, including intraoperative complications, postoperative morbidity, and oncologic adequacy of surgical specimens, were evaluated. RESULTS Laparoscopic-ELAPE was successful in all 33 included patients, with no patient requiring conversion to an open approach. Mean operation time was 200 minutes, and mean intraoperative blood loss was 90 mL. Except for bowel perforation in 2 patients (6.1%), there were no intraoperative complications. Two patients (6.1%) had positive circumferential resection margins. Median length of hospital stay was 7 days. The 30-day morbidity and mortality rates were 15.2% and 0%, respectively. Postoperative complications within 30 postoperative days included perineal wound infection (2 patients, 6.1%), respiratory infection (2 patients, 6.1%), and chylous fistula (1 patient, 3.0%). Complications at a median follow-up time of 12 months (range, 3-19 months) included local tumor recurrence (1 patient, 3.0%), perineal dehiscence (2 patients, 6.1%), perineal seroma (1 patient, 3.0%), bowel obstruction (1 patient, 3.0%), urinary retention (2 patients, 6.1%), and chronic perineal pain (2 patients, 6.1%). There were no instances of perineal hernia, persistent sinus, or peristomal hernia. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic-ELAPE with primary suturing appears to be a feasible and safe treatment approach for low rectal cancer, with acceptable short-term outcomes.","Yang, Xuyang; Jin, Chengwu; Deng, Xiangbing; Wang, Meng; Zhang, Yuanchuan; Wei, Mingtian; Meng, Wenjian; Wang, Ziqiang",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

We analysed the LCs and converted LCs performed at our Department and as well as cases where the primary operations were conducted at other institutions but they were unable to provide the adequate therapy for the injury, thus the patients were transferred to our institution. At the 1st Department of Surgery complications occurred in 0,66% (30/4885) of all LCs. 327 converted LCs were done, complications occurred in 26 (7.95%) times. 22 patients were transferred to the 1st Department of Surgery from other institutions. Bilio-vascular injuries occurred in 61% (41/78). ERCP was performed in 25 cases with a 92% success rate. Reoperation was needed in 41% (28/41). Biliary reconstruction during the reoperation was performed via hepaticojejunostomy in 82% of all reoperations. The therapeutic solutions of LC's complications are complex.

In the test, 450 juveniles with an average weight (10.02 ± 0.22) g were randomly divided into six groups with triplicate, and were fed with 350, 400, 450, 500, 550 and 600 g/kg iso-lipid test diet twice 1 day for 8 weeks, respectively. The results showed that: (1) With the increase of protein level, the body weight gain rate and specific growth rate first increased and then reduced, while the feed coefficient rate first decreased and then increased, while the protein efficiency significantly decreased (P < 0.05). (2) With the increase of protein level, the condition factor, hepaticsomatic index and visceralsomatic index significantly reduced (P < 0.05). (3) With the increase of protein level, the crude protein content of whole fish and muscle gradually increased, while the crude lipid content gradually decreased. (4) High-protein diet (550-600 g/kg) significantly increased the plasma total protein content and decreased the triglyceride content of orange-spotted grouper (P < 0.05). (5) Compared with the 350 g/kg group, 500, 550, 600 g/kg groups significantly increased the activities of glutamic-pyruvic transaminase and glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase in liver (P < 0.05). (6) With the increase of protein level, the protease activity of intestine first increased and then decreased, and reached the maximum at the protein level of 500 g/kg, while lipase and amylase decreased significantly (P < 0.05).

Key residency directories are varied in designation, despite it being one of the most important match factors for applicants. The Council of Residency Directors EM County Program Community of Practice consists of residency program leadership from a unified collective of programs that identify as ""county."" This paper's framework was spurred from numerous group discussions to better understand unifying themes that define county programs. Methodology This institutional review board-exempt work provides qualitative descriptive results via a mixed-methods inquiry utilizing survey data and quantitative data from programs that self-designate as county. Unique treatment analysis and critique Most respondents work, identify, and trained at a county program. The majority defined county programs by commitment to care for the underserved, funding from the city or state, low-resourced, and urban setting. Major qualitative themes included mission, clinical environment, research, training, and applicant recommendations. Comparing the attributes of programs by self-described type of training environment, county programs are typically larger, older, in central metro areas, and more likely to be 4 years in duration and have higher patient volumes when compared to community or university programs. When comparing hospital-level attributes of primary training sites county programs are more likely to be owned and operated by local governments or governmental hospital districts and authorities and see more disproportionate-share hospital patients. Implications for education and training in EM To be considered a county program we recommend some or most of the following attributes be present: a shared mission to medically underserved and vulnerable patients, an urban location with city or county funding, an ED with high patient volumes, supportive of resident autonomy, and research expertise focusing on underserved populations.","Buchanan, Jennie A; Moreira, Maria; Taira, Taku; Byyny, Richard; Jarou, Zachary; Taylor, Todd Andrew; Sungar, W Gannon; Angerhofer, Christy; Dyer, Sean; White, Melissa; Amin, Dhara; D Lall, Michelle; Caro, David; E Parsons, Melissa; Smith, Teresa Y",AEM education and training,https://doi.org/10.1002/aet2.10664; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34616979/,52

METHODS With nutritionist guidance, we developed a nutrition presentation for breast cancer patients. English- (n = 29) and Spanish-speaking (n = 19) patients were recruited from 5 safety-net hospitals, an academic cancer center, and a Latina cancer support organization. Materials were tested using multiple rounds of cognitive interviewing (with an adapted USDA interview guide), followed by study team reviews and modifications, until saturation. RESULTS Seven rounds of interviews per language were needed. Approximately 25% of interviewees had less than a high school education. Changes included adapting to regional lexicons and resolving vague/confusing phrasing. Specific food examples needed cultural tailoring. Text color coding (red/bad, green/good) was requested. Labeled images enhanced participants' understanding of concepts. Spanish speakers expressed a desire to understand nutrition labeling, and this was emphasized in the Spanish slides. CONCLUSION Cognitive interviews were an important tool for creating a nutrition curriculum tailored to the needs of low-literacy, mostly immigrant patients.

We examine the impact of reductions in cost and sharing restrictions for satellite imagery data from NASA's Landsat program (the longest record of remote-sensing observations of the Earth) on academic science using a sample of about 24,000 Landsat publications by over 34,000 authors matched to almost 3,000 unique study locations. Analyses show that improved access had a substantial and positive effect on the quantity and quality of Landsat-enabled science. Improved data access also democratizes science by disproportionately helping scientists from the developing world and lower-ranked institutions to publish using Landsat data. This democratization in turn increases the geographic and topical diversity of Landsat-enabled research. Scientists who start using Landsat data after access is improved tend to focus on previously understudied regions close to their home location and introduce novel research topics. These findings suggest that policies that improve access to valuable scientific data may promote scientific progress, reduce inequality among scientists, and increase the diversity of scientific research.","Nagaraj, Abhishek; Shears, Esther; de Vaan, Mathijs",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2001682117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32900947/,52

We classified ICA terminus occlusions into 2 groups according to the occlusion pattern of the circle of Willis and hypothesized that clinical outcomes would significantly differ between them. METHODS Consecutive patients with acute ICA terminus occlusions evaluated by baseline computed tomographic angiography were enrolled. We investigated the occlusion patterns in the circle of Willis, retrospectively classified patients into simple ICA terminus occlusion (STO; with good Willisian collaterals from neighboring cerebral circulation) and complex ICA terminus occlusion (CTO; with one or more of A2 anterior cerebral artery, fetal posterior cerebral artery occlusion, or hypoplastic/absent contralateral A1; or with poor collaterals from anterior communicating artery) groups, and compared their baseline characteristics and outcomes. RESULTS The STO group (n=58) showed smaller infarct volumes at 72 hours than the CTO group (n=34) (median, 81 mL [interquartile range, 38-192] vs. 414 mL [193-540], P<0.001) and more favorable outcomes (3-month modified Rankin Scale 0-3, 44.8% vs. 8.8%, P<0.001; 3-month mortality, 24.1% vs. 67.6%, P<0.001). In multivariable analyses, STO remained an independent predictor for favorable outcomes (odds ratio 6.1, P=0.010). CONCLUSIONS Favorable outcomes in STO group suggested that the outcomes of acute ICA terminus occlusions depend on Willisian collateral status. Documenting the subtypes on computed tomographic angiography would help predict patient outcome.","Lee, Sun-Uk; Hong, Ji Man; Kim, Sun Yong; Bang, Oh Young; Demchuk, Andrew M; Lee, Jin Soo",Journal of stroke,https://doi.org/10.5853/jos.2015.01529; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26915505/,52

To better understand this phenomenon, we examined the impact of the viral agent polyinosine-polycytidylic acid [Poly (I:C)] on the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) to pharyngeal epithelial cells. STUDY DESIGN In vitro model of cultured human pharyngeal epithelial cells. METHODS Detroit 562 cells, a human pharyngeal carcinoma cell line, were pretreated with Poly (I:C). Poly (I:C)-induced expression of platelet-activating factor receptor (PAF-R) was assayed using real-time polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence microscopy. Bacterial adhesion to these epithelial cells was assessed using immunofluorescence microscopy and colony formation assays. RESULTS Pretreatment with Poly (I:C) increased mRNA and protein expression of PAF-R in Detroit 562 cells and enhanced the adherence of Spn to these epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS RNA viral infection can enhance PAF-R expression in epithelial cells and increase the adherence of Spn. These findings might explain in part the mechanisms that underlie the increase in bacterial infection following URIs.","Kawabata, Masaki; Kurono, Yuichi",The Laryngoscope,https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.22328; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21994002/,52

Preoperative embolization of the left gastric artery and splenic artery (PAE) has been suggested to lower anastomotic leak rates. We present the results of our 5-year experience with this technique. METHODS All patients undergoing PAE before esophagectomy since introduction of this technique in 2004 were compared in a 1:2 matched-pair analysis with patients without PAE. Matching criteria were type of anastomosis, neoadjuvant treatment, comorbidity, and age. Data were derived from a retrospective chart review from 2000 to 2006 that was perpetuated as a prospective database up to date. Outcome measures were anastomotic leak, overall complications, and hospital stay. RESULTS Between 2000 and 2009, 102 patients underwent esophagectomy for cancer in our institution with an overall leak rate of 19% and a mortality of 8%. All 19 patients having PAE since 2004 were successfully matched 1:2 to 38 control patients without PAE; both groups were similar regarding demographics and operation characteristics. Two PAE (11%) and 8 control patients (21%) had an anastomotic leak, but the difference was statistically not significant (p=0.469). Overall and major complication rates for PAE and control group were 89% versus 79% (p=0.469) and 37% versus 34% (p=1.000), respectively. Median intensive care unit and hospital stay were 3 versus 3 days (p=1.000) and 22 versus 17 days (p=0.321), respectively. CONCLUSIONS In our experience, PAE has no significant impact on complications and anastomotic leak in particular after esophagectomy.","Diana, Michele; Hübner, Martin; Vuilleumier, Henri; Bize, Pierre; Denys, Alban; Demartines, Nicolas; Schäfer, Markus",The Annals of thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2011.01.081; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21420069/,52

In tumor cells, the VEGFA-VEGFR2 binding activates autocrine survival and migration signaling in angiogenesis independent manner. The present in vitro study investigated the effects of single and combined treatments with Ramucirumab and Paclitaxel on cell growth and migration highlighting the mechanisms underlying the interaction between the two drugs in gastric cancer cells. Cell growth and motility were investigated in human gastric cancer cell lines characterized by different tumorigenicity. The inhibitory effect on cell growth exerted by both drugs was potentiated by their combination and was synergistic. Ramucirumab was able to enhance the inhibitory effect exerted by Paclitaxel on cell cycle progression. A synergistic action was also observed in the expression of proteins crucial for cell motility, microtubule organization and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, synergistic inhibition of VEGFR2 expression was obtained by the drug combination. These findings highlighted the importance of the combined treatment to strongly inhibit all the main molecules of both PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK pathways thus preventing possible reactivations due to cross-talk phenomena. The combined treatment with Ramucirumab seems to be a promising option to overcome the Paclitaxel resistance.","Refolo, Maria Grazia; Lotesoriere, Claudio; Lolli, Ivan Roberto; Messa, Caterina; D'Alessandro, Rosalba",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64195-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346056/,52

The viral surface glycoprotein, GP, orchestrates the surprisingly complex process by which filoviruses gain access to the cytoplasm of their host cells. GP mediates viral attachment to cells through multiple, redundant interactions with cell-surface factors. GP then induces virion internalization by a process that resembles cellular macropinocytosis. Within the endo/lysosomal pathway, GP undergoes a series of structural rearrangements, controlled by interactions with host factors, that prime and activate it to bring about fusion between the viral and cellular lipid bilayers. Membrane fusion delivers the viral nucleocapsid core into the cytoplasm, which is the site of filovirus replication. This review summarizes our understanding of the filovirus entry mechanism, with emphasis on recent findings.","Miller, Emily Happy; Chandran, Kartik",Current opinion in virology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coviro.2012.02.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22445965/,52

We evaluated whether adding myocardial blush grade (MBG) and quantitative reperfusion ventricular arrhythmia ""bursts"" (VABs) surrogates provide a more informative biosignature of optimal reperfusion in patients with Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 3 flow and ST-segment recovery (STR). METHODS AND RESULTS Anterior STEMI patients with final TIMI 3 flow had protocol-blinded analyses of simultaneous MBG, continuous 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) STR, Holter VABs, and day 5-14 SPECT imaging infarct size (IS) assessments. Over 20 million cardiac cycles from >4500 h of continuous ECG monitoring in subjects with STR were obtained. IS and clinical outcomes were examined in patients stratified by MBG and VABs. VABs occurred in 51% (79/154) of subjects. Microcirculation (MBG 2/3) was restored in 75% (115/154) of subjects, of whom 53% (61/115) had VABs. No VABs were observed in subjects without microvascular flow (MBG of 0). Of 115 patients with TIMI 3 flow, STR, and MBG 2/3, those with VABs had significantly larger IS (median: 23.0% vs 6.0%, p=0.001). Multivariable analysis identified reperfusion VABs as a factor significantly associated with larger IS (p=0.015). CONCLUSIONS Despite restoration of normal epicardial flow, open microcirculation, and STR, concomitant VABs are associated with larger myocardial IS, possibly reflecting myocellular injury in reperfusion settings. Combining angiographic and ECG parameters of epicardial, microvascular, and cellular response to STEMI intervention provides a more predictive ""biosignature"" of optimal reperfusion than do single surrogate markers.","Majidi, Mohamed; Kosinski, Andrzej S; Al-Khatib, Sana M; Smolders, Lilian; Cristea, Ecaterina; Lansky, Alexandra J; Stone, Gregg W; Mehran, Roxana; Gibbons, Raymond J; Crijns, Harry J; Wellens, Hein J; Gorgels, Anton P; Krucoff, Mitchell W",European heart journal.

AIM OF THE STUDY To analyze the changes that SARS-CoV-2 has caused regarding the harvesting of corneal donor tissue and eye bank activities in Germany. METHODS A questionnaire was provided to 26 eye banks in Germany, consisting of questions about adaptations made in the screening of potential donors and the harvesting of corneal tissue following the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS Eighteen eye banks actively reduced recruitment of donors and two banks ceased all activity. Additional diagnostic screening was performed in eight banks, using conjunctival swabs and/or nasopharyngeal swabs. In six eye banks, additional protective measures, such as FFP2 masks and/or facial shields, were implemented. Overall, a mean reduction in the number of obtained donor tissues of 17% was observed. DISCUSSION Conjunctival and/or nasopharyngeal swabs of donors have been implemented by a minority. Reasons for not performing additional tests may be moderate sensitivity and lack of validation for postmortem use of RT-PCR testing. Also, the hazard of SARS-CoV-2 entering the corneal donor pool with subsequent transmission might be perceived as theoretical. Face shields provide a sufficient barrier against splash and splatter contamination but may be insufficient against aerosols. Additional face masks would provide support against aerosols, but it remains debatable if corneal harvesting can be considered an aerosol-producing procedure. In the future we expect to see changes in current guidelines because of a surge in scientific activities to improve our understanding of the risks involved with cornea donation in the COVID-19 pandemic, and because current practice may reduce the availability of donor corneas due to new exclusion criteria while the demand remains unchanged.","Trigaux, Céline; Salla, Sabine; Schroeter, Jan; Tourtas, Theofilos; Thomasen, Henning; Maier, Philip; Hellwinkel, Olaf J C; Wittmershaus, Ilka; Merz, Patrick R; Seitz, Berthold; Nölle, Bernhard; Schrage, Norbert; Roters, Sigrid; Apel, Melissa; Gareiss-Lok, Andrea; Uhlig, Constantin E; Thaler, Sebastian; Raber, Florian; Kampik, Daniel; Geerling, Gerd; Menzel-Severing, Johannes",Current eye research,https://doi.org/10.1080/02713683.2020.1828487; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33016144/,52

These are the most widely used markers for autophagy thanks to the association of their lipidated forms with autophagic membranes. The Atg8 protein family expanded in animals and plants, with most Drosophila species having two Atg8 homologs. In this Brief Report, we use clear-cut genetic analysis in Drosophila melanogaster to show that lipidated Atg8a is required for autophagy, while its non-lipidated form is essential for developmentally programmed larval midgut elimination and viability. In contrast, expression of Atg8b is restricted to the male germline and its loss causes male sterility without affecting autophagy. We find that high expression of non-lipidated Atg8b in the male germline is required for fertility. Consistent with these non-canonical functions of Atg8 proteins, loss of Atg genes required for Atg8 lipidation lead to autophagy defects but do not cause lethality or male sterility.","Jipa, András; Vedelek, Viktor; Merényi, Zsolt; Ürmösi, Adél; Takáts, Szabolcs; Kovács, Attila L; Horváth, Gábor V; Sinka, Rita; Juhász, Gábor",Autophagy,https://doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2020.1856494; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33249988/,52

METHOD A quantitative, non-experimental, correlational online survey was administered using a convenience sample of 203 participants from the United Kingdom with no medical issues that affected buying behaviour during the pandemic to examine perceptions related to food insecurity, and self-reported food hoarding behaviour. RESULTS Younger adults and lower income groups reported higher food insecurity perceptions and hoarding behaviours. Consuming COVID-19 information from websites was significantly associated with food insecurity perceptions, while information from social media was significantly associated with more food hoarding behaviours. CONCLUSIONS Younger adults and lower income groups are vulnerable populations from the perspective of food insecurity and hoarding behaviour in times of health disasters like pandemics. While social media can play a positively catalytic role during crises, excessive online information and misinformation can contribute negatively to public panic and feelings of insecurity. Implications for disaster preparedness and future research are discussed.The findings suggest that age is the main predictor of food insecurity and hoarding behaviour, with younger adults more likely to be affected. They also suggest that people are turning to NHS wesbites, which were deemed more trustworthy than social media, to avoid 'news fatigue' and avoiding speculation.

CONCLUSION A similar pattern of acquisition was never described before in MDS. The coexistence of two independent, high-risk oncogenic, rare events in the same clone suggests that there may be a functional constraint for synergy between the two events, leading to a proliferative advantage and suggests the utility of extended genotyping in myeloid malignancies.","Monti, Valentina; Bagnoli, Filippo; Bolli, Niccolo'; Vittoria, Laura; Stioui, Sabine; Moiraghi, Maria Luisa; Pruneri, Giancarlo; Testi, Maria Adele",Tumori,https://doi.org/10.1177/0300891620949666; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831008/,52

However, preparations for large-scale manufacturing, such as building production facilities, are typically delayed until a vaccine is proven safe and effective. This makes sense from a commercial perspective, but incurs great costs in terms of lives lost and damage to the economy. Several policy options are available to reduce this delay, all of which involve incentives or subsidies to invest in production facilities. We review existing approaches, then propose a novel alternative using ""option-based guarantees"" in which the government commits to paying a proportion of the manufacturer's preparation costs should the product turn out not to be viable. Counterintuitively, this ""payment for failure"" is appropriate because in the case of success, a company makes a profit from the product itself, and does not need additional money from the government. While other approaches have critical roles, we argue that option-based guarantees are the most promising approach to ensuring a rapid vaccine for COVID-19. Compared to the alternative approaches, they reduce both costs to the government and risk to the companies, while maintaining an incentive to produce a high-quality product quickly and at scale.","Manheim, David; Foster, Derek",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.26482.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33500777/,52

HSRs to ICMs are classified into immediate reactions (IRs) and non-immediate reactions (NIRs) according to if they occur within 1 h or longer after ICM administration. The diagnosis of HSRs to ICM is complex as skin test (ST) sensitivity ranges widely, and drug provocation test (DPT) protocols are heterogeneous. In this manuscript, we describe the clinical characteristics of a series of patients confirmed as HSR to ICM and the diagnosis procedure carried out, looking into those cases confirmed as HSRs to multiple ICMs. For this purpose, we prospectively evaluated patients suggestive of HSRs to ICMs and classified them as IRs or NIRs. STs were carried out using a wide panel of ICMs, and in those with a negative ST, a single-blind placebo controlled DPT was performed with the culprit. If ST or DPT were positive, then tolerance was assessed with an alternative negative ST ICM. We included 101 cases (12 IRs and 89 NIRs) confirmed as allergic. Among them, 36 (35.64%) cases were allergic to more than one ICM (8 IRs and 28 NIRs). The most common ICM involved were iomeprol and iodixanol. Although not statistically significant, the percentage of patients reporting anaphylaxis was higher in patients allergic to multiple ICMs compared with patients allergic to a single ICM (50 vs. 25%). Likewise, the percentage of positive results in STs was higher in patients allergic to multiple ICMs compared with those allergic to a single ICM (for IR 62.5 vs. 25%, p > 0.05; and for NIR, 85.71 vs. 24.59%, p < 0.000). In cases allergic to more than one ICM, DPT with negative-ST ICM was positive in more than 60% (24/36) of cases. Therefore, allergy to multiple ICMs is common, associated to severe reactions in IRs, and confirmed frequently by positive STs. The allergological work-up should include DPT not only to establish the diagnosis but also to identify safe alternative ICM, even if ICM is structurally unrelated and ST is negative. More studies are needed to clarify mechanisms underlying cross-reactivity among ICMs.","Doña, Inmaculada; Bogas, Gádor; Salas, María; Testera, Almudena; Moreno, Esther; Laguna, Jose Julio; Torres, María José",Frontiers in pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.575437; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33071787/,52

METHODS By optimizing the design of primers and probes and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) conditions, we achieved simultaneous detection of multiple influenza and zoonotic influenza viruses, including H1N1, H5N1, and H9N2 strains, in a one-step, quantitative real-time RT-PCR array (rRT-PCR array) of RNA from multiple influenza strains utilizing a single set of conditions for RT-PCR amplification. The target sequences from all targeted zoonotic influenza viruses were cloned into recombinant RNA virus particles, which were used to evaluate sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of the zoonotic influenza viruses RT-PCR array. RESULTS The detection limit of the array was shown to be between 10(0) and 10(1) copies per reaction, and the standard curve demonstrated a linear range from 10 to 10(6) copies. Thus, the analytical sensitivity of this zoonotic influenza viruses RT-PCR array is 10-100 times higher than conventional RT-PCR. Specificity of the one-step zoonotic influenza viruses RT-PCR array was verified by comparison of results obtained with retroviral-like particles (RVPs), which contained RNA from isolates of seasonal influenza viruses, zoonotic influenza viruses, and other pathogens known to cause acute respiratory disease. CONCLUSION The high sensitivity, rapidity, reproducibility, and specificity of this zoonotic influenza viruses rRT-PCR array has been verified as being sufficient to detect the presence of multiple zoonotic influenza viruses in a single assay. The zoonotic influenza viruses RT-PCR array might provide rapid identification of emergent zoonotic influenza viruses strains during influenza outbreaks and disease surveillance initiatives.","Chen, Yao; Liu, Tiancai; Cai, Lijuan; Du, Hongyan; Li, Ming",Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcla.21627; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24218127/,52

Polymicrobial infection is common and, due to the difficulties in confirming the etiology of pneumonia, empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy is frequently used. Areas covered: The author based this article on literature identified from PubMed. The author's search terms included: pneumonia, community-acquired pneumonia, HIV, children. The articles reviewed included original studies, recent review articles and current guidelines on the management of pneumonia in HIV-infected children. The microbiological etiology and the empiric and pathogen-specific antimicrobial therapy of community-acquired pneumonia in HIV-infected and HIV-exposed infants and children are also discussed. Expert opinion: There are many changing epidemiological factors impacting antimicrobial management of community-acquired pneumonia in the context of HIV infection in infants and children. These include vaccination strategies, antimicrobial prophylaxis, emerging drug-resistant pathogens, and recognition of the importance of viruses and tuberculosis in the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia.

METHODS The Aichi Medical Association performed a comprehensive survey of pediatric anaphylaxis cases aged under 15 years from 87 secondary and 25 tertiary emergency care hospitals in Aichi Prefecture (population 7.5 million), Japan. RESULTS Between April 2016 and March 2020, 3423 cases of anaphylaxis were identified. Food items were the most frequent trigger (73%), followed by exercise after food ingestion (4.3%), and drugs (2.2%). Egg (19%) and milk (17%) specifically were the most frequent among food triggers, while the largest proportional increase was observed in tree nuts from 6.0% in 2017 to 15% in 2019. Overall, 1647 (48%) cases were admitted to the hospital, of which 26 (0.8%) were admitted to the intensive care unit. Drug-induced anaphylaxis was associated with the highest admission rate (71%). Of the 2493 food-induced anaphylaxis cases, 1107 (44%) were treated with adrenaline. Among them, 343 cases included previously prescribed adrenaline auto-injectors (AAI), with 225 (66%) usages prior to hospital arrival. There was no significant difference in the admission rate between the cases in which AAIs were used and those with adrenaline administered in the hospital (68% and 72%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS The proportion of tree nuts in food-induced anaphylaxis increased significantly. Although prehospital AAI use has become widespread, it was not associated with lower admission rate compared to in-hospital adrenaline usage.","Kitamura, Katsumasa; Ito, Tomoya; Ito, Komei",Allergology international : official journal of the Japanese Society of Allergology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.alit.2021.04.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140240/,52

We suggest the usefulness of the subxiphoid approach in thymectomy. We could extend the indications of thoracoscopic thymectomy for invasive tumors. Thoracoscopic thymectomy with the combined resection of part of the brachiocephalic vein was possible. The pathological diagnosis of the tumor was diffuse large cell B-cell lymphoma. Since the postoperative complications were minimal, postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy could be initiated without delay. This operation might be unnecessary. However, we could decrease the invasiveness of surgery using our procedures without sternotomy.

METHODS To explore the efficacy and safety of Reduning injection in the treatment of COVID-19, a randomized, open-labeled, multicenter, controlled trial was conducted from 12 general hospitals between 2020.02.06 and 2020.03.23. Patients with COVID-19 who met the diagnostic criteria of the ""Diagnosis and Treatment Program for Novel Coronavirus Infection Pneumonia (Trial Fifth Edition)"". Patients were randomized to routine treatment with or without Reduning injection (20 mL/day for 14 days) (ChiCTR2000029589). The primary endpoint was the rate of achieving clinical symptom recovery on day 14 of treatment. RESULTS There were 77 and 80 participants in the Reduning and control groups. The symptom resolution rate at 14 days was higher in the Reduning injection than in controls [full-analysis set (FAS): 84.4% vs. 60.0%, P=0.0004]. Compared with controls, the Reduning group showed shorter median time to resolution of the clinical symptoms (143 vs. 313.5 h, P<0.001), shorter to nucleic acid test turning negative (146.5 vs. 255.5 h, P<0.001), shorter hospital stay (14.1 vs. 18.1 days, P<0.001), and shorter time to defervescence (29 vs. 71 h, P<0.001).

Utilizing poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) in the molecular delivery approach, the formed emulsion nanovesicle (TMB-NPs@PLGA) exhibits an enrichment of the collective signal molecules in a single antibody-antigen conjugation. A specific antibody-conjugated TMB-NPs@PLGA forms an immunocomplex sandwich structure upon the addition of influenza virus (IV)/A. The addition of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) dissolves the PLGA nanovesicles, releasing the encapsulated TMB-NPs. Sequentially, the TMB-NPs release TMB molecules upon the addition of DMSO. The released TMB is catalytically oxidized by H2O2 with self-assembled protein-inorganic nanoflowers, where copper nanoflowers (CuNFs) acted as the nanozyme. The developed immunoassay demonstrates high sensitivity for IV/A with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 32.37 fg mL-1 and 54.97 fg mL-1 in buffer and serum, respectively. For practical needs, a clinically isolated IV/A/H3N2 and spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were detected with the LODs of 17 pfu mL-1 and 143 fg mL-1, respectively.

144853,Keratinocyte-Expressed Podoplanin is Dispensable for Multi-Step Skin Carcinogenesis.,2020-06-24,"OBJECTIVES To assess whether pooled sample testing with nucleic acid amplification tests was a potential alternative to three single-site sample testing to screen for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections in asymptomatic men who have sex with men. METHODS We prospectively compared pooled sample testing with single-site sample testing in asymptomatic MSM. Self-obtained paired rectal samples, one gargle sample and one first-void urine sample were collected from participants to generate two sets of samples: one for pooled sample testing and the other for single-site testing. We used modified pooled sampling, which is defined as the use of gargle samples, instead of swabs, for the pooled sample to test for pharyngeal infection. RESULTS This study included 513 MSM. The positive rates of C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae were 20.3% and 11.7%, respectively, for single-site sample testing. Compared with the sensitivity of single-site testing as the gold standard, the sensitivities of pooled sample testing for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae were 94.2% (95% CI 88.0% to 97.3%) and 98.3% (95% CI 90.9% to 99.9%), respectively. The concordance rate and kappa coefficient were 98.3% (95% CI 96.7% to 99.2%) and 0.945 (95% CI 0.859 to 1.000), respectively, for C. trachomatis and 98.8% (95% CI 90.1% to 100%) and 0.943 (95% CI 0.857 to 1.000), respectively, for N. gonorrhoeae. CONCLUSIONS The modified pooled sampling had a comparably high consistency with single-site sample testing. The results strongly suggest that the gargle sample is suitable as a part of pooled sample for STI screening of C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae.","Ando, Naokatsu; Mizushima, Daisuke; Watanabe, Koji; Takano, Misao; Shiojiri, Daisuke; Uemura, Haruka; Aoki, Takahiro; Yanagawa, Yasuaki; Kikuchi, Yoshimi; Oka, Shinichi; Gatanaga, Hiroyuki",Sexually transmitted infections,https://doi.org/10.1136/sextrans-2020-054666; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33082236/,52

Recent experimental and clinical data suggest that the non-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor pentoxifylline (PTX) may decrease progression of chronic kidney disease. However, a large-scale randomised clinical trial is needed to determine whether PTX can reduce ESRD and death in DKD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Veterans Affairs (VA) PTXRx is a pragmatic, randomised, placebo-controlled multicentre VA Cooperative Study to test the hypothesis that PTX, when added to usual care, leads to a reduction in the time to ESRD or death in patients with type 2 diabetes with DKD when compared with usual care plus placebo. The study aims to enrol 2510 patients over a 4-year period with an additional up to 5-year follow-up to generate a total of 646 primary events. The primary objective of this study is to compare the time until ESRD or death (all-cause mortality) between participants randomised to PTX or placebo. Secondary endpoints will be: (1) health-related quality of life, (2) time to doubling of serum creatinine, (3) incidence of hospitalisations for congestive heart failure, (4) incidence of a three-point major adverse cardiovascular events composite (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke), (5) incidence of peripheral vascular disease, (6) change in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio from baseline to 6 months and (7) rate of annual change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) during the study period. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This study was approved by the VA Central Institutional Review Board (cIRB/18-36) and will be conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice.

METHODS The physiological responses of 27 very preterm infants were analysed following variations in the light level environments of their incubators over 10 hours. Heart and respiratory rates, systemic oxygen saturation and regional cerebral oxygen saturations were recorded using near-infrared spectroscopy, and the variation of each parameter was analysed. RESULTS We analysed 332 light level changes. Heart rate increased by 3.8 beats per minute (range -2.6 to 12.6), respiratory rate by six cycles per minute (-1.5 to 26) and regional cerebral oxygen saturation by 1.1% (-0.5% to 3.9%) (p < 0.05 each) when delta lux was over 50. Only respiratory rate decreased significantly, by -8.4 cycles per minute (-28 to -0.4), when delta lux was 50 or lower (p < 0.05). The initial level of illumination altered the very preterm infants' responses, with higher reactivity for higher ambient light levels. CONCLUSION Very preterm infants reacted to moderate variations in illumination in their incubator, within recommended ranges of light levels, suggesting that they may detect even small light level variations.","Zores, Claire; Dufour, André; Pebayle, Thierry; Langlet, Claire; Astruc, Dominique; Kuhn, Pierre",Acta paediatrica,https://doi.org/10.1111/apa.13085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26080896/,52

148039,A screen of approved drugs and molecular probes identifies therapeutics with anti-Ebola virus activity.,2015,"OBJECTIVES This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of thoracoscopic lobectomy in infants and children. MATERIALS AND METHODS From January 1994 to November 2013, 347 patients underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic lobe resection at two institutions. All procedures were performed by or under the direct guidance of a single surgeon. Patients' ages ranged from 1 day to 18 years, and weights ranged from 2.8 to 78 kg. Preoperative diagnosis included sequestration/congenital pulmonary airway malformation (n=306), severe bronchiectasis (n=24), congenital lobar emphysema (n=13), and malignancy (n=4). RESULTS Of the 347 procedures, 342 were completed thoracoscopically. Operative times ranged from 35 minutes to 240 minutes (average, 115 minutes). Average operative time when a trainee was the primary surgeon was 160 minutes. There were 81 upper, 25 middle, and 241 lower lobe resections. There were four intraoperative complications (1.1%) requiring conversion to an open thoracotomy. The postoperative complication rate was 3.3%, and 3 patients required re-exploration for a prolonged air leak. Hospital length of stay (LOS) ranged from 1 to 16 days (average). In patients <5 kg and <3 months of age, the average operative time was 90 minutes, and the LOS was 2.1 days. CONCLUSIONS Thoracoscopic lung resection is a safe and efficacious technique. With proper mentoring it is an exportable technique, which can be performed by pediatric surgical trainees. The procedures are safe and effective even when performed in the first 3 months of life. Early resection avoids the risk of later infection and malignancy.","Rothenberg, Steven S; Middlesworth, William; Kadennhe-Chiweshe, Angela; Aspelund, Gudrun; Kuenzler, Keith; Cowles, Robert; Bodenstein, Lawrence; Kay, Saundra; Shipman, Kristin; Rothenberg, Cathryn; Stolar, Charles; Stylianos, Steven",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

149396,Design and evaluation of a novel approach to invisible electrocardiography (ECG) in sanitary facilities using polymeric electrodes.,2021-03-18,"Recovery of grassland birds in agricultural landscapes is a global imperative. Agricultural landscapes are complex, and the value of resource patches may vary substantially among species. The spatial extent at which landscape features affect populations (i.e., scale of effect) may also differ among species. There is a need for regional-scale conservation planning that considers landscape-scale and species-specific responses of grassland birds to environmental change. We developed a spatially explicit approach to optimizing grassland conservation in the context of species-specific landscapes and prioritization of species recovery and applied it to a conservation program in Kentucky (USA). We used a hierarchical distance-sampling model with an embedded scale of effect predictor to estimate the relationship between landscape structure and abundance of eastern meadowlarks (Sturnella magna), field sparrows (Spizella pusilla), and northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus). We used a novel spatially explicit optimization procedure rooted in multi-attribute utility theory to design alternative conservation strategies (e.g., prioritize only northern bobwhite recovery or assign equal weight to each species' recovery). Eastern meadowlarks and field sparrows were more likely to respond to landscape-scale resource patch adjacencies than landscape-scale patch densities. Northern bobwhite responded to both landscape-scale resource patch adjacencies and densities and responded strongly to increased grassland density. Effects of landscape features on local abundance decreased as distance increased and had negligible influence at 0.8 km for eastern meadowlarks (0.7-1.2 km 95% Bayesian credibility intervals [BCI]), 2.5 km for field sparrows (1.5-5.8 km 95% BCI), and 8.4 km for bobwhite (6.4-26 km 95% BCI). Northern bobwhites were predicted to benefit greatly from future grassland conservation regardless of conservation priorities, but eastern meadowlark and field sparrow were not. Our results suggest similar species can respond differently to broad-scale conservation practices because of species-specific, distance-dependent relationships with landscape structure. Our framework is quantitative, conceptually simple, customizable, and predictive and can be used to optimize conservation in heterogeneous ecosystems while considering landscape-scale processes and explicit prioritization of species recovery.","Yeiser, John M; Morgan, John J; Baxley, Danna L; Chandler, Richard B; Martin, James A",Conservation biology : the journal of the Society for Conservation Biology,https://doi.org/10.1111/cobi.13750; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151469/,52

However, little is known to date about the metabolic underpinnings underlying SM aggressiveness, which has thus far impeded the development of strategies to leverage metabolic dependencies when existing KIT-targeted treatments fail. Here, we show that plasma metabolomic profiles were able to discriminate indolent from advanced forms of the disease. We identified N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) as the most predictive metabolite of SM severity. High plasma levels of GlcNAc in patients with advanced SM correlated with the activation of the GlcNAc-fed hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) in patients BM aspirates and purified BM MCs. At the functional level, GlcNAc enhanced human neoplastic MCs proliferation and promoted rapid health deterioration in a humanized mouse model of SM. In addition, in the presence of GlcNAc, immunoglobulin E-stimulated MCs triggered enhanced release of proinflammatory cytokines and a stronger acute response in a mouse model of passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. Mechanistically, elevated GlcNAc levels promoted the transcriptional accessibility of chromatin regions that contain genes encoding mediators of receptor tyrosine kinases cascades and inflammatory responses, thus leading to a more aggressive phenotype. Therefore, GlcNAc is an oncometabolite driver of SM aggressiveness. This study suggests the therapeutic potential for targeting metabolic pathways in MC-related diseases to manipulate MCs effector functions.","Agopian, Julie; Da Costa, Quentin; Nguyen, Quang Vo; Scorrano, Giulia; Kousteridou, Paraskevi; Yuan, Min; Chelbi, Rabie; Goubard, Armelle; Castellano, Remy; Maurizio, Julien; Teodosio, Cristina; de Sepulveda, Paulo; Asara, John; Orfao, Alberto; Hermine, Olivier; Dubreuil, Patrice; Brenet, Fabienne",Blood,https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2020008948; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974006/,52
150035,Sugiol inhibits STAT3 activity via regulation of transketolase and ROS-mediated ERK activation in DU145 prostate carcinoma cells.,2015,"BACKGROUND Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an efficacious intervention for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Digital CBT may provide a scalable means of delivering CBT at a population level. We investigated the efficacy of a novel digital CBT program in those with GAD for outcomes of anxiety, worry, depressive symptoms, sleep difficulty, wellbeing, and participant-specific quality of life. METHODS This online, two-arm parallel-group superiority randomized controlled trial compared digital CBT with waitlist control in 256 participants with moderate-to-severe symptoms of GAD. Digital CBT (Daylight), was delivered using participants' own smartphones. Online assessments took place at baseline (Week 0; immediately preceding randomization), mid-intervention (Week 3; from randomization), post-intervention (Week 6; primary endpoint), and follow-up (Week 10). RESULTS Overall, 256 participants were randomized and intention-to-treat analysis found Daylight reduced symptoms of anxiety compared with waitlist control at post-intervention, reflecting a large effect size (adjusted difference [95% CI]: 3.22 [2.14, 4.31], d = 1.08). Significant improvements were found for measures of worry; depressive symptoms, sleep difficulty, wellbeing, and participant-specific quality of life. CONCLUSION Digital CBT (Daylight) appears to be safe and efficacious for symptoms of anxiety, worry, and further measures of mental health compared with waitlist control in individuals with GAD.","Carl, Jenna R; Miller, Christopher B; Henry, Alasdair L; Davis, Michelle L; Stott, Richard; Smits, Jasper A J; Emsley, Richard; Gu, Jenny; Shin, Olivia; Otto, Michael W; Craske, Michelle G; Saunders, Kate E A; Goodwin, Guy M; Espie, Colin A",Depression and anxiety,https://doi.org/10.1002/da.23079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32725848/,52

However, late catheter fracture is a well-known complication of totally implantable venous access device, particularly in Groshong silicone catheter. Recently, a specific type of totally implantable venous access device made with Groshong silicone has been introduced to facilitate power injection of contrast medium for enhanced computed tomography. CASES DESCRIPTION: We reported three cases of catheter fracture in power-injectable Groshong silicone totally implantable venous access device. From May 2012 to August 2014, 66 patients underwent power-injectable Groshong silicone totally implantable venous access device implantation at our institution, with a median follow-up of 20.1 (range 0.2-58.1) months. The catheters in all patients were inserted into the internal jugular vein under ultrasound guidance and were connected to the port implanted in the upper chest through the subcutaneous tunnel. Chemotherapy was administered using these routes. Fractures of all three cases specifically showed a torn catheter section: smooth surface on one side, and a rough edge on the other side of the catheter, suggesting that long-term repeated stretch force may be related with the mechanism of fracture. CONCLUSION: Totally implantable venous access devices with Groshong silicone catheters, if inserted via the internal jugular vein, have a potential risk for late catheter fracture.","Saijo, Fumito; Mutoh, Mitsuhisa; Tokumine, Joho; Yoshinobu, Odaka; Hama, Hikaru; Namima, Takashige; Shibahara, Mii; Tokumura, Hiromi",The journal of vascular access,https://doi.org/10.1177/1129729819834512; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854915/,52

METHODS Clinical and cost data were retrospectively compared between open and RAL LPJ performed at a single center from 2008-2015. RESULTS Twenty-six patients underwent LPJ: 19 open and 7 RAL. Two robot-assisted cases converted to open were included in the open group for analysis. Patients undergoing RAL LPJ had less intraoperative blood loss, a shorter surgical length of stay, and lower medication costs. Operation supply cost was higher in the RAL group. No difference in hospitalization cost was found. CONCLUSIONS Versus the open approach, RAL LPJ performed for chronic pancreatitis shortens hospitalization and reduces medication costs; hospitalization costs are equivalent. A higher operative cost for RAL LPJ is mitigated by a shorter hospitalization. Decreased morbidity and healthcare resource economy support use of the robotic approach for LPJ when appropriate.","Kirks, Russell C; Lorimer, Patrick D; Fruscione, Michael; Cochran, Allyson; Baker, Erin H; Iannitti, David A; Vrochides, Dionisios; Martinie, John B",The international journal of medical robotics + computer assisted surgery : MRCAS,https://doi.org/10.1002/rcs.1832; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28548233/,52
153062,Thermal proteome profiling in zebrafish reveals effects of napabucasin on retinoic acid metabolism.,2020-10-28,"Yellowhorn (Xanthoceras sorbifolium) is an important edible woody oil tree species that is endemic to China. Drought and heat stresses are factors severely limiting the high-quality development of the yellowhorn industry. Transcription factors (TFs) play critical roles in regulating the response of woody plant species to water deficit or high temperature. However, the MYB TFs that respond to combined drought and heat stress in yellowhorn remain unclear. Here, we first investigated the physiological changes in 5 yellowhorn varieties in response to combined stress treatments. We observed significant changes in antioxidant enzyme activities and photosynthesis. The Maigaiti variety yielded the best results and was selected for subsequent experiments. An R2R3-type MYB TF, designated XsMYB44, was isolated from the leaves of yellowhorn. XsMYB44 expression was strongly induced by combined stress. Suppression of XsMYB44 expression via virus-induced gene silencing weakened yellowhorn tolerance to both individual and combined drought and heat stress, and the increased susceptibility was coupled with decreased plant height, fresh weight and relative water content and inhibited stomatal closure. Moreover, compared with the individual stresses, the combined stress caused increased reactive oxygen species levels and decreased antioxidant enzyme activities and proline content in XsMYB44-silenced plants. Furthermore, the expression levels of several defense-related genes were reduced in the XsMYB44-silenced plants. Overall, we studied the physiological characteristics of 5 yellowhorn varieties, and the results demonstrated that XsMYB44 acts as a positive regulator in the yellowhorn response to combined stress by triggering stomatal closure to maintain water levels and by modulating ROS homeostasis.","Li, Jingbin; Zhao, Shang; Yu, Xue; Du, Wei; Li, He; Sun, Ying; Sun, Hao; Ruan, Chengjiang",Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2021.03.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740680/,52

The concept of RPS includes all procedures derived from various efforts minimizing the invasiveness of surgery, with single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) being the ultimate reduced port technique. Reduced-port laparoscopic gastrectomy (RPLG) for gastric cancer has not yet been fully established and still has issues such as feasibility, oncological validity, training, and education. The short-term results of reported studies are acceptable. However, long-term results that verify positive results or radical cure even in cases of cancer have not yet been published. Patients for whom RPLG is indicated should be selected carefully. Prospective multicenter studies should be conducted to establish RPS as a truly evidence-based practice that addresses not only cosmesis but also the appropriate balance between minimal invasiveness and radical cure.","Inaki, Noriyuki; Tsuji, Toshikatsu; Doden, Kenta; Sakimura, Yusuke; Tawara, Hiroki; Matsui, Ryota; Yamamoto, Daisuke; Kitamura, Hirotaka; Bando, Hiroyuki; Yamada, Tetsuji",Translational gastroenterology and hepatology,https://doi.org/10.21037/tgh.2016.04.04; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28138605/,52

We recently reported a T-20-based lipopeptide fusion inhibitor (LP-40) showing improved anti-HIV activity (X. Ding et al., J Virol 91:e00831-17, 2017, https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.00831-17). In this study, we designed LP-50 and LP-51 by refining the structure and function of LP-40. The two new lipopeptides showed dramatically enhanced secondary structure and binding stability and were exceptionally potent inhibitors of HIV-1, HIV-2, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), and chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV), with mean 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) in the very low picomolar range. They also exhibited dramatically increased potencies in inhibiting a panel of T-20- and LP-40-resistant mutant viruses. In line with their in vitro data, LP-50 and LP-51 exhibited extremely potent and long-lasting ex vivo anti-HIV activities in rhesus monkeys: serum dilution peaks that inhibited 50% of virus infection were >15,200-fold higher than those for T-20 and LP-40. Low-dose, short-term monotherapy of LP-51 could sharply reduce viral loads to undetectable levels in acutely and chronically SHIV infected monkey models. To our knowledge, LP-50 and LP-51 are the most potent and broad HIV-1/2 and SIV fusion inhibitors, which can be developed for clinical use and can serve as tools for exploration of the mechanisms of viral entry and inhibition.IMPORTANCE T-20 remains the only membrane fusion inhibitor available for the treatment of viral infection, but its relatively low anti-HIV activity and genetic barrier for drug resistance have significantly limited its clinical application. Here we report two new lipopeptide-based fusion inhibitors (LP-50 and LP-51) showing extremely potent inhibitory activities against diverse HIV-1, HIV-2, SIV, and T-20-resistant variants. Promisingly, both inhibitors exhibited potent and long-lasting ex vivo anti-HIV activity and could efficiently suppress viral loads to undetectable levels in SHIV-infected monkey models. We believe that LP-50 and LP-51 are the most potent and broad-spectrum fusion inhibitors known to date and thus have high potential for clinical development.","Chong, Huihui; Xue, Jing; Zhu, Yuanmei; Cong, Zhe; Chen, Ting; Guo, Yan; Wei, Qiang; Zhou, Yusen; Qin, Chuan; He, Yuxian",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00775-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29899103/,52

The study aims to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of our technique of robotic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy (RSPDP) by a stepwise approach. METHODS The data of consecutive patients presented for RSPDP from 2014 to 2019 at Verona University were retrieved from a prospectively maintained database. The patients were divided into two groups based on the surgical procedure performed, such as Kimura's (KG) or Warshaw's (WG) technique, and then compared. RESULTS In the study period, 32 patients underwent RSPDP. Twenty-three patients presented for the Kimura procedure (72%), while nine patients underwent the Warshaw procedure (28%). A higher body mass index was found in the KG (26 ± 4 vs. 22 ± 3, p = 0.037). Regarding the pathological data, the WG group differed in the tumor dimension, and the lymph nodes harvested (30 ± 2 vs. 17 ± 10, 9 ± 5 vs. 3 ± 4, p = 0.0028, and p = 0.005, respectively). Notably, no conversions and mortality were recorded. The overall morbidity was 25% ( eight patients) with no difference between the groups (p = 0.820). The mean length of stay was 8 days, and was similar between the groups (p = 0.350). CONCLUSIONS The present study suggests that RSPDP is a valid option for the treatment of benign or pre-malignant pancreatic diseases of the distal pancreas, with comparable morbidity with the standard treatment and no mortality. Further research is needed to standardize the technique and to assess the immunological, surgical, and financial benefits of the procedure.","Esposito, A; Casetti, L; De Pastena, M; Ramera, M; Montagnini, G; Landoni, L; Bassi, C; Salvia, R",Updates in surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13304-020-00731-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32162271/,52

This is a retrospective study of 34 robotic-assisted kidney transplant (RAKT) utilizing our technique from July 2015 to June 2017. The study is performed in a quaternary private hospital setting. The surgery was performed using our novel peritoneal flap technique allowing complete extraperitonealization of the kidney. Total of 34 patients underwent RAKT in our hospital. Mean age was 40.6 ± 8.1 years, there were 25 males and 9 females. 30 had single vessel and four had double vessels. 27 patients received living donor graft while seven had deceased donor. The mean blood loss was 88 ± 51 mL, mean anastomotic time was 32 ± 3.3 min, mean total operative time was 145 ± 15 min, mean hospital stay was 5.8 ± 2.3 days, time to nadir creatinine was 4.3 ± 1.9 days, median creatinine level at the end of 6 months was 1.3 mg/dL. There were three open conversions in our series, one of which had delayed graft function requiring hemodialytic support. Total extraperitonealization of the graft reproduces closely the technique of open kidney transplant with good graft function. This would be a step toward the ultimate goal of performing a complete extraperitoneal robotic transplant. Further refinements in robotic instruments would make this a reality in near future.","Adiyat, Kishore Thekke; Vinod, Kumar K; Vishnu, Raveendran; Ramaprasad, M K; Unni, Vavullipathy N; John, Roy P",Journal of robotic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11701-018-0781-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29392612/,52

It is hypothesized that the overall number of orthopaedic trauma encounters (OTEs), the number of OTEs related to both high and low severity injuries, and the proportion of OTEs related to high severity versus low severity injuries decreased compared with previous years. METHODS A retrospective analysis was conducted of OTEs between 2016 and 2020. High and low severity OTEs were classified according to an algorithm created by the researchers. Data were statistically analyzed and compared with external data for traffic counts, motor vehicle accidents, and Transportation Security Administration checkpoints. RESULTS A 45.1% decrease (P = 0.0005) was seen in OTEs from March and April 2016-2019 compared with 2020. The decrease began approximately 12 days before the shelter-in-place order. There was a 58.8% decrease in high severity injuries with a fracture (P = 0.013) and a 42.9% decrease in low severities injuries (P = 0.0003). The proportion of high to low severity OTEs was unchanged. CONCLUSIONS The quantity of OTEs was significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and Michigan shelter-in-place order. A decrease in both high and low severity OTEs was found; however, there was no statistically significant change in the ratio of high to low severity OTEs compared with previous years. Although it is difficult to determine what portion of the decrease in OTE is attributable to the shelter-in-place order versus the COVID-19 pandemic in general, data suggest both play a role.

METHODS Between March and April 2020, old adults diagnosed with major depressive disorder (single or recurrent episode) as defined by the DSM-5 were recruited from psychiatric clinics or inpatient wards, whereas 31 healthy older adults without a history of depression or other psychiatric illnesses were recruited from voluntary organisations or elderly community centres. Their depressive symptoms, perceived severity of the pandemic, perceived time spent on receiving related information, perceived health, levels of loneliness, perceived coping efficacy, suicidal ideation, and the level of symptomatic responses to a specific traumatic stressor in the past week were assessed. RESULTS In total, 21 men and 43 women aged 61 to 89 years were interviewed through telephone by trained research assistants. Of them, 33 were older adults with LLD (cases) and 31 were healthy older adults (controls). Older people with LLD had a higher level of suicidal ideation than healthy controls, after controlling for the level of depression and medical comorbidity (F (1, 59) = 5.72, p = 0.020). Regression analyses showed that coping efficacy and loneliness accounted for a significant portion of the variance in suicidal ideation, and loneliness significantly predicted the level of stress. Mediation analyses reveal an indirect effect between group and suicidal ideation through coping efficacy (Z = 2.43, p = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS Older people with LLD are at increased suicidal risk and require timely mental health support. Coping efficacy and loneliness are important predictors for suicidal ideation and stress.","Louie, L L C; Chan, W C; Cheng, C P W",East Asian archives of psychiatry : official journal of the Hong Kong College of Psychiatrists = Dong Ya jing shen ke xue zhi : Xianggang jing shen ke yi xue yuan qi kan,https://doi.org/10.12809/eaap2055; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33753570/,52

Although there have been significant breakthroughs in the management of skin cancers with the introduction of novel diagnostic tools and innovative therapies, skin cancer mortality, morbidity and costs heavily burden the society. OBJECTIVE Members of the European Association of Dermato-Oncology, European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology, International Dermoscopy Society, European Dermatology Forum, European Board of Dermatovenereology of the European Union of Medical Specialists and EORTC Cutaneous Lymphoma Task Force have joined this effort to emphasize the fundamental role that the specialist in Dermatology-Venereology has in the diagnosis and management of different types of skin cancer. We review the role of dermatologists in the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with melanoma, non-melanoma skin cancers and cutaneous lymphomas, and discuss approaches to optimize their involvement in effectively addressing the current needs and priorities of dermato-oncology. DISCUSSION Dermatologists play a crucial role in virtually all aspects of skin cancer management including the implementation of primary and secondary prevention, the formation of standardized pathways of care for patients, the establishment of specialized skin cancer treatment centres, the coordination of an efficient multidisciplinary team and the setting up of specific follow-up plans for patients. CONCLUSION Skin cancers represent an important health issue for modern societies. The role of dermatologists is central to improving patient care and outcomes. In view of the emerging diagnostic methods and treatments for early and advanced skin cancer, and considering the increasingly diverse skills, knowledge and expertise needed for managing this heterogeneous group of diseases, dermato-oncology should be considered as a specific subspecialty of Dermatology-Venereology.","Garbe, C; Peris, K; Soura, E; Forsea, A M; Hauschild, A; Arenbergerova, M; Bylaite, M; Del Marmol, V; Bataille, V; Samimi, M; Gandini, S; Saiag, P; Eigentler, T K; Lallas, A; Zalaudek, I; Lebbe, C; Grob, J-J; Hoeller, C; Robert, C; Dréno, B; Arenberger, P; Kandolf-Sekulovic, L; Kaufmann, R; Malvehy, J; Puig, S; Leiter, U; Ribero, S; Papadavid, E; Quaglino, P; Bagot, M; John, S M; Richard, M-A; Trakatelli, M; Salavastru, C; Borradori, L; Marinovic, B; Enk, A; Pincelli, C; Ioannides, D; Paul, C; Stratigos, A J",Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,https://doi.org/10.1111/jdv.16849; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32840022/,52

Children with a usual source of care presenting for influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms were compared with those presenting with other symptoms. METHODS During the 2009 H1N1 outbreak, parents visiting a PED in a low-income area in New York City in June 2009 were surveyed using open- and close-ended questions. Sociodemographic factors and reasons for seeking care in the PED rather than their usual source of care were compared between groups. RESULTS There were no sociodemographic differences among children brought to the PED for ILI and those brought for other presenting symptoms. Those families with a child with ILI symptoms were less likely to report urgency as the primary reason they brought their child to the PED. A common reason reported for coming to the PED was limited access to care. In further exploration of limited access, parents with a child with ILI symptoms were more likely to report that their usual source of care did not have any evening and/or weekend hours, and they did not know how to reach their provider after hours. CONCLUSIONS Enhancing access to primary care settings and encouraging parents to use their primary care providers might reduce the utilization of the PED for nonurgent problems during epidemics.","Stockwell, Melissa S; Rausch, John; Sonnett, Meridith; Stanberry, Lawrence R; Rosenthal, Susan L",Pediatric emergency care,https://doi.org/10.1097/pec.0b013e3182131420; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21490538/,52

Programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand-1 (PDL-1) pathway is an important target for the cancer immunotherapy. However, there is a robust pre-clinical and clinical data regarding inhibitor effect of this pathway on the acute or chronic viral infections. Thus, blockade of this pathway may lead to an anti-viral effect and decrease viral load. Here, we report the clinical course of coronavirus infection 2019 infection of a patient in whom older aged, having multiple co-morbidities, and taking nivolumab for metastatic malignant melanoma. In contrast to her older age, comorbidities, and cancer diagnosis, she was in a good condition, and there was also no pneumonia finding. We think that this good clinical course of coronavirus infection 2019 infection may be related to blockade of PD-1/PDL-1 pathway with nivolumab. It is impossible to say that blockade of PD-1/PDL-1pathway is a treatment option for COVID-19; however, we want to share our experience.","Yekedüz, Emre; Dursun, Bengü; Aydın, Güle Ç; Yazgan, Satı C; Öztürk, Halis H; Azap, Alpay; Utkan, Güngör; Ürün, Yüksel",Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,https://doi.org/10.1177/1078155220924084; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32423324/,52

In this study, we evaluated the in vitro effects of five antimicrobials against biofilms formed by Klebsiella pneumoniae in ETTs. K. pneumoniae was added to minimal mucin medium prior to inoculation in microtiter plates containing ETT fragments. Biofilm susceptibility was assessed by crystal violet staining. At 24 h, the antimicrobials significantly reduced biofilm formation. At 48 h, all of the antimicrobial agents exhibited significant reductions in biofilm formation, even at concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Tigecycline and fosfomycin showed the greatest inhibition capacity, with good activity at concentrations twofold greater than the MIC. K. pneumoniae exhibited excellent biofilm formation ability, with formation in the first 24 h and significantly reduced antimicrobial activity. These results contribute to the establishment of new antibiotic breakpoints for the adequate management of infections associated with biofilm formation.

The isolate could produce obvious cytopathic effects on EPC cells, while was shown to be of low virulence for juvenile koi. Complete genome sequencing revealed the genome of the SVCV-265 strain is 11,029 nucleotides in length and phylogenetic analysis showed the isolate was clustered within Asia clade but was divergent from Chinese A1, A2 and BJ0505-2 strains. Previous report indicated that the G and P gene of SVCV shared similar topologies of evolutionary trees. In this study, phylogenetic analysis based on the P gene sequences showed the SVCV-265 was clustered into Iai subgroup and divergent from Chinese isolates A1, A2 and BJ0505-2, which were clustered into Iaii group. However, sequence alignment of the G gene showed the SVCV-265 has a close relationship with A1, A2 and BJ0505-2 isolates. Recombination analysis of all the whole sequences of SVCV available revealed isolates A2 and BJ0505-2 were likely the homologous recombination descendants of the A1 and SVCV-265. The crossover regions were located between 3845-6387nt for A2 and 3573-6444 nt for BJ0505-2, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of the crossover region further confirmed these findings.

We carried out a comparative study in two Spanish university hospitals to reassert this fact and evaluated the impact on vaccination rates of a specific program aimed at promoting influenza vaccination among MSs.Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was performed describing influenza vaccination rates and motivations for vaccination during the 2017/18 campaign among MSs in two hospitals affiliated to the same university. We subsequently performed a community-based intervention study during the 2018/19 campaign evaluating the impact of a strategy for promoting influenza vaccination, comparing the hospital where the intervention took place (hospital A) with the one where it did not take place (hospital B).Results: During de 2017/18 campaign the overall influenza vaccination rate was 44.8%, with no differences between hospitals A and B (difference: 3.9%; 95% CI: -4.36-12.16; p-value = .4).

These recombinant fragments were designed as parts of two different structural proteins from SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). One recombinant polypeptide, S251-683, was designed as part of the spike glycoprotein, and the other three polypeptides comprised almost the whole nucleocapsid protein, avoiding the last 25 C-terminal amino acids. Immunization with a cocktail of these four polypeptides yielded a specific polyclonal antibody that is able to recognize SARS-CoV-infected cells by an immunofluorescence assay. This polypeptide cocktail was also used to set up an ELISA-based IgG-plus-IgM antibody detection test, which showed 99% specificity and 90% sensitivity upon evaluation using sera from 100 healthy negative controls and 20 SARS patients. Separate immunoreactivity assays with each recombinant polypeptide demonstrated that a combination of N and S protein fragments was more suitable than the individual peptides for developing a serological assay for SARS-CoV.","Giménez, Luis G; Rojas, Jose; Rojas, Almudena; Mendoza, Joaquín; Camacho, Ana G",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,https://doi.org/10.1128/cvi.00252-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19038782/,52

Pigs were either mock-infected or infected with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a virus known to cause immunosuppressive respiratory disease, and then pigs were co-infected with PRCV, which normally causes subclinical respiratory infection. We collected samples for six independent experiments from 178 pigs that were also used for pathological studies. We detected a significant reduction in innate NK-cell-mediated cytotoxic function in PRRSV-infected pigs, which was synergistically further decreased in pigs co-infected with PRCV. Subsequently, in association with clinical signs we observed elevated levels of proinflammatory (IL-6), Th-1 (IL-12), and regulatory (IL-10 and TGF-β) cytokines. Increased frequencies of CD4CD8 double-positive T lymphocytes and myeloid cells, in addition to the elevated Th-1 and proinflammatory cytokines in dual-infected pigs, contributed to the severity of lung disease in pigs. The results of our study clarify how each virus modulates the host innate and adaptive immune responses, leading to inflammatory reactions and lung pathology. Thus measurements of cytokines and frequencies of immune cells may serve as indicators of the progression of respiratory viral co-infections, and provide more definitive approaches for treatment.","Renukaradhya, Gourapura J; Alekseev, Konstantin; Jung, Kwonil; Fang, Ying; Saif, Linda J",Viral immunology,https://doi.org/10.1089/vim.2010.0051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20883160/,52

The UK has been officially free of bluetongue virus (BTV) since 2011. In 2015, BTV-8 re-emerged in France and since then BTV has been spreading throughout Europe. In response to this outbreak, risk-based active surveillance was carried out at the end of the vector seasons in 2017 and 2018 to assess the risk of incursion of BTV into Great Britain. METHOD Atmospheric dispersion modelling identified counties on the south coast of England at higher risk of an incursion. Blood samples were collected from cattle in five counties based on a sample size designed to detect at least one positive if the prevalence was 5 per cent or greater, with 95 per cent confidence. RESULTS No virus was detected in the 478 samples collected from 32 farms at the end of the 2017 vector season or in the 646 samples collected from 43 farms at the end of the 2018 vector season, when tested by RT-qPCR.

Specifically, this paper explores servant leadership as an inhibitive factor for workplace bullying, both directly and indirectly in the presence of employee resilience as a mediator. It further explores whether proactive personality moderates the indirect relationship.Design/methodology/approachThis is an empirical study based on analysis of survey data collected from 408 employees working in services and manufacturing sector organisations in Pakistan. Structural equation modelling was used to test the research model.FindingsStructural equation modelling results support the proposition that servant leadership helps in discouraging workplace bullying, both directly and indirectly, in the presence of employee resilience as a mediator. However, employee proactive personality moderates this process, such that the association between resilience and workplace bullying is stronger for individuals with high proactive personality.Research limitations/implicationsThis study's findings illuminate the strong potential of servant leadership for managing workplace bullying. This potential is attributed to positive role modelling in the workplace, which may assist in building followers' resilience. This study provides evidence to support the importance of leadership in the process by which employees develop better psychological resources to combat bullying at work.Originality/valueThis is the first study that examines the direct relationship between servant leadership and bullying at work.

Hence, the purpose of this study was to find out how to further facilitate the development of (foreign) entrepreneurship in Kazakhstan. In doing so, the authors attempted to identify factors influencing entrepreneurial intention (EI), specifically among the foreigners in Kazakhstan, and highlight the role of government support (GS) in general and under COVID-19. The study conceptualized the extended “TPB + Moderator (GS)” model. The hypotheses were tested on a sample of 362 new and established foreign entrepreneurs in Kazakhstan by means of descriptive analysis, Pearson’s correlation analysis, and multiple regression analysis. The study found that the foreigners’ personal attitude (PA) toward entrepreneurship was the strongest factor motivating their EI, followed by their perceived behavioral control (PBC) as the second strongest factor. The role of GS strengthened each effect of PA and PBC on EI. The moderating effect of GS and PA is greater than that of GS and PBC;each of the moderating effects is lower in magnitude than each of the direct effects.

To prevent virus spreading we need to stay at home as much as possible. During pandemic people are advised to stay at home but there are times when residents need to leave the house. From the activities carried outside the house possibilities of bacteria and viruses which brought into the house through items used or carried is eminent. To overcome this a strategy is needed to reduce exposure of bacteria and viruses from outside the house. One way that can be done is through artificial lighting strategies to disinfect items. Artificial lighting is any source of light that does not come from nature and consumes energy. In relation to the prevention and spread of the corona virus it is known that UVC rays are a type of light wave that can be used to kill the corona virus. This research was conducted through a data driven method to see what possibilities could be done to prevent the spread of the virus at home. The object of study used in this case is the Huni residence which is a modular residential concept and can be easily configured to allow zoning in the house to be replaced as needed. Through this research the concept of a sterilizer using UVC light was formed that could meet the needs of the new normal.

Dental bitewing radiograph analysis is central to diagnosis and treatment planning and when used to detect enamel-only proximal caries it is an important tool in minimum intervention and preventive dentistry. However, the subtle patterns of enamel-only proximal caries visible in a bitewing radiographs are difficult to detect and often missed by dental practitioners. This pilot study measures the ability of a cohort of third-year dental students to detect enamel-only proximal caries in bitewing radiographs with and without the use of a deep learning assistive software AssistDent(R). We demonstrate an increased ability in the detection of enamel-only proximal caries by the students using AssistDent, showing a mean sensitivity level of 0.80 (95%CI {+/-} 0.04), increased from 0.50 (95%CI {+/-} 0.13) p<0.01 shown by students not using AssistDent. This improvement in ability was achieved without an increase in false positives. Mean false positives per bitewing radiograph recorded by students when using AssistDent was 2.64 (95%CI {+/-} 0.57), and by students without using AssistDent was 2.46 (95%CI {+/-} 1.51). Based on these results we conclude that the AI-based software AssistDent significantly improves third-year dental students' ability to detect enamel-only proximal caries and could be considered as a tool to support minimum intervention and preventive dentistry in teaching hospitals and general practice.

168609,Evaluating Performance of Drug Repurposing Technologies,2020-12-03,"This study examines whether ethnic minorities in general and Asian minorities in particular have perceived an increase in discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic, a phenomenon known as COVID-19–associated discrimination (CAD). Drawing on the CILS4COVID data, which were collected among 3,517 individuals in the initial phase of the pandemic (mainly between April and June 2020), we demonstrate that especially Asian minorities (n = 80) report instances of CAD. Furthermore, CAD is reported more by Asian respondents residing in administrative districts that have been particularly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, i.e., that had high seven-day COVID-19 incidence rates. Higher levels of perceived CAD are also reported by respondents originating from the Americas (n = 61) and the former Soviet Union (n = 197), but only in administrative districts with high incidence rates. We conclude that CAD reported by these groups is likely due to these groups being perceived to pose a higher threat of infection transmission. CAD reported by Asian-origin respondents is not entirely due to the actual threat posed by COVID-19, but rather to a mix of perceived threat, overt discrimination and the attribution of various negative experiences suffered since the outbreak of the pandemic to CAD. © 2021 The Authors","Dollmann, J.; Kogan, I.",Research in Social Stratification and Mobility,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rssm.2021.100631,52

Simultaneously, the study of online education has blossomed within the human computer interaction community, with new systems, experiments, and observations creating and exploring previously undiscovered online learning environments. In this study we endeavor to characterize this entire landscape of online learning experiences using a national survey of 2260 US adults who are balanced to match the demographics of the U.S. We examine the online learning resources that they consult, and we analyze the subjects that they pursue using those resources. Furthermore, we compare both formal and informal online learning experiences on a larger scale than has ever been done before, to our knowledge, to better understand which subjects people are seeking for intensive study. We find that there is a core set of online learning experiences that are central to other experiences and these are shared among the majority of people who learn online. We conclude by showing how looking outside of these core online learning experiences can reveal opportunities for innovation in online education.","Kross, Sean; Hargittai, Eszter; Redmiles, Elissa M.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05268v1.pdf,52
169098,Comparative viral metagenomics from chicken feces and farm dust in the Netherlands,2021-03-10,"The adaptive B cell response is driven by the expansion, somatic hypermutation, and selection of B cell clones. A high number of clones in a B cell population indicates a highly diverse repertoire, while clonal size distribution and sequence diversity within clones can be related to antigen’s selective pressure. Identifying clones is fundamental to many repertoire studies, including repertoire comparisons, clonal tracking and statistical analysis. Several methods have been developed to group sequences from high-throughput B cell repertoire data. Current methods use clustering algorithms to group clonally-related sequences based on their similarities or distances. Such approaches create groups by optimizing a single objective that typically minimizes intra-clonal distances. However, optimizing several objective functions can be advantageous and boost the algorithm convergence rate. Here we propose a new method based on multi-objective clustering. Our approach requires V(D)J annotations to obtain the initial clones and iteratively applies two objective functions that optimize cohesion and separation within clones simultaneously. We show that under simulations with varied mutation rates, our method greatly improves clonal grouping as compared to other tools. When applied to experimental repertoires generated from high-throughput sequencing, its clustering results are comparable to the most performing tools. The method based on multi-objective clustering can accurately identify clone members, has fewer parameter settings and presents the lowest running time among existing tools. All these features constitute an attractive option for repertoire analysis, particularly in the clinical context to unravel the mechanisms involved in the development and evolution of B cell malignancies.","Abdollahi, Nika; de Septenville, Anne; Ripoche, Hugues; Davi, Frédéric; Bernardes, Juliana S.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.01.462736,52

Both countries are the top two palm oil producers in the world and have ambitious targets to increase the palm oil-based biodiesel mandate. In Indonesia, the current programme of blending 20 per cent palm oil into 80 per cent diesel (B20) increases to B30 in 2020. Likewise, Malaysia plans to increase its biodiesel mandate from B10 to B20 in 2020. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has infected millions and brought the global economy to a near-deadlock. The effect is particularly severe in the fuel industry owing to movement restrictions and the historic drop in oil prices. Evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 on the biodiesel industry is crucial for policymakers but challenging as the pandemic has evolved with intense speed. This article aims to discuss the impact of COVID-19 on the Indonesian and Malaysian biodiesel industry. In addition to that, a number of possible solutions to overcome the challenges were addressed and proposed. Despite severely affected by COVID-19, both Indonesia and Malaysia can use this momentum to improve and strengthen their biodiesel sector. Given its fiscal deficit, Indonesia should postpone its biodiesel blending mandate as the subsidy to support the programme can worsen the country's financial stability. In Malaysia, where labour shortage is prevalent, modernising plantations with automated equipment, for instance, could potentially remove the dirty and dangerous stereotypes associated with plantation works, thus attracting more locals to work in the palm oil plantation and solving the labour shortage. This paper also briefly addresses the adoption of Industry 4.0 and Circular Economy for the palm oil biodiesel industry.","Veza, I.; Muhammad, V.; Oktavian, R.; Djamari, D. W.; Said, M. F.

The repository contains over 430,000 articles as of 20 September 2021 and intends to provide a one-stop shop for COVID-19 evidence. Considering that systematic reviews conduct high-quality searches, this study assesses the comprehensiveness and currency of the repository against the total number of studies in a representative sample of COVID-19 systematic reviews. METHODS: Our sample was generated from all the studies included in the systematic reviews of COVID-19 published during April 2021. We estimated the comprehensiveness of COVID-19 L{middle dot}OVE repository by determining how many of the individual studies in the sample were included in the COVID-19 L{middle dot}OVE repository. We estimated the currency as the percentage of studies that were available in the COVID-19 L{middle dot}OVE repository at the time the systematic reviews conducted their own search. RESULTS: We identified 83 eligible systematic reviews that included 2132 studies. COVID-19 L{middle dot}OVE had an overall comprehensiveness of 99.67% (2125/2132). The overall currency of the repository, that is, the proportion of articles that would have been obtained if the search of the reviews was conducted in COVID-19 L{middle dot}OVE instead of searching the original sources, was 96.48% (2057/2132). Both the comprehensiveness and the currency were 100% for randomised trials (82/82). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 L{middle dot}OVE repository is highly comprehensive and current. Using this repository instead of traditional manual searches in multiple databases can save a great amount of work to people conducting systematic reviews and would improve the comprehensiveness and timeliness of evidence syntheses. This tool is particularly important for supporting living evidence synthesis processes.","Verdugo-Paiva, F.; Vergara, C.; Avila, C.; Castro, J.; Cid Cid, J.; Contreras, V.; Jara, I.; Jimenez, V.; Lee, M.

170358,"Coronavirus, Psychoanalysis, and Philosophy: Conversations on Pandemics, Politics and Society",2021,"Scientific journalism is a critical way in which the public can remain informed and benefit from new scientific findings. Such journalism also shapes the public’s view of the current state of scientific findings and legitimizes experts. Those covering science can only cite and quote a limited number of sources. Sources may be identified by the journalist’s research or by recommendations by other scientists. In both cases, biases may influence who is identified and ultimately included as an expert. We analyzed 22,001 non-research articles published by Nature to quantify possible disparities. Our analysis considered three possible sources of disparity: gender, name origin, and country affiliation. To explore these sources of disparity, we extracted cited authors’ names and affiliations, as well as extracted names of quoted speakers. While citations and quotations within a piece do not reflect the entire information-gathering process, they can provide insight into the demographics of visible sources. We then used the extracted names to predict gender and name origin of the cited authors and speakers. In order to appropriately quantify the level of difference, we must identify a suitable reference set for comparison. We chose first and last authors within primary research articles in Nature and a subset of Springer Nature articles in the same time period as our comparator. In our analysis, we found a skew towards male quotation in Nature journalism-related articles, but quotation is trending toward equal representation at a faster rate than first and last authorship in academic publishing. Interestingly, we found that the gender disparity in quotes was column-dependent, with the “Career Features” column reaching gender parity. Our name origin analysis found a significant over-representation of names with predicted Celtic/English origin and under-representation of names with a predicted East Asian origin. This finding was observed both in extracted quotes and journal citations, but dampened in citations. Finally, we performed an analysis to identify how countries vary in the way that they’re described in scientific journalism. We focused on two groups of countries: countries that are often mentioned in articles, but do not often have affiliated authors cited, and countries that have affiliated authors that are often cited, but the country is not typically mentioned. We found that the articles in which the less cited countries occur tend to have more agricultural, extraction-related, and political terms, whereas articles including highly cited countries have broader scientific terms. This discrepancy indicates a possible lack of regional diversity in the reporting of scientific output.","Davidson, Natalie R.; Greene, Casey S.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.21.449261,52

Drawing of blood, its storage and shipment from the clinical site to the test laboratory, and the subsequent isolation, cryopreservation and thawing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) before the actual test is performed can introduce numerous variables that may jeopardize the results. Therefore, no T cell test is valid without assessing the functional fitness of the PBMC being utilized. This can only be accomplished through inclusion of positive controls that actually evaluate the performance of the antigen-specific T cell and antigen presenting cell (APC) compartments. CEF peptides have been commonly used to this extent. Here we show that CEF peptides fail as a positive control in nearly half of test subjects. Moreover, CEF peptides only measure CD8+ T cell functionality. More reliable alternatives for the assessment of CD8+ T cells are introduced here, as well as positive controls for the CD4+ T cell and APC compartments. In sum, we offer new tools and strategies for the assessment of PBMC functional fitness required for reliable T cell immune monitoring.","Lehmann, Alexander A.; Reche, Pedro A.; Zhang, Ting; Suwansaard, Maneewan; Lehmann, Paul.

Two parallel processes are going on in the international system at the moment. On one hand, there is a growing interdependence among states with the emergence of globalisation and economic liberalisation;on the other hand, with rising protectionism, countries are becoming isolationist focusing more on domestic issues through their ‘nation first’ policies. But the transnational nature of the plague will continue to drive nations to come together and push for collective leadership both at the present times and also in a post-COVID world. In the context of South Asia, greater multilateral cooperation among countries is required to deal with the challenges posed by the pandemic as the region is already prone to several natural as well as man-made calamities.

The global COVID-19 outbreak, combined with the growing complexity of supply chain networks, has exposed supply chains’ vulnerability to disruption. Therefore, improving the supply chain viability is the primary way to deal with the risk of supply chain disruption. Using the method of literature research, this conceptual paper systematically reviewed and sorted out relevant literature, extracted corresponding capabilities, and put forward relevant research propositions. From the perspective of the resource-based view and resource-dependent theory, this study investigates specific dimensions of the blockchain-enabled supply chain capability: connectivity, network capability, and supply chain reconfiguration and the impact of external resource-dependent capability on the viability of the supply chain. The propositions show that the blockchain-enabled supply chain capability, and external resource-dependent capability will positively impact supply chain viability. It is expected to assist supply chain firms in implementing blockchain technology to increase supply chain viability and improve their capacity to achieve sustainable supply chain development during the crisis.","Yin, Weili",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13158231,52

172767,The Influence of Latent and Chronic Infection on Pathogen Persistence,2021,"Laboratory-generated bioaerosols are widely used in aerobiology studies of viruses, however few comparisons of alternative nebulizers exist. We compared aerosol production and virus survival for a Collison nebulizer, vibrating mesh nebulizer (VMN), and hydraulic spray atomizer (HAS). We also measured the dry size distribution of the aerosols produced, calculated the droplet sizes before evaporation and the dry size distribution from normal saline solution. Dry count median diameters of 0.25, 0.63 and 0.76 µm were found for normal saline from the Collison nebulizer, VMN and HSA, respectively. The volume median diameters were 2.91, 3.2 and 2.43 µm, respectively. The effect of nebulization on the viability of two influenza A viruses (IAVs) (H1N1, H3N2) and human rhinovirus (HRV)-16, was assessed by direct nebulization into an SKC Biosampler. The HSA had least impact on surviving fractions (SFs) of H1N1 and H3N2 (89±5%, 94±3%), followed by the Collison nebulizer (82±2%, 82±3%). The VMN yielded SFs of 78±2% and 76±2%, respectively. Conversely, for HRV-16, the VMN produced higher SFs (86±15%). Our findings indicate that although the VMN had the greatest impact on IAV survival, it produced higher aerosol concentrations within the airborne-size range making it more suitable where high aerosol mass production is required. Importance Viral respiratory tract infections cause millions of lost days of work and physician visits globally, accounting for significant morbidity and mortality. Respiratory droplet and droplet nuclei from infected hosts are the substantial potential carriers of such viruses within indoor environments. Laboratory-generated bioaerosols are applied in understanding the transmission and infection of viruses, simulating the physiological aspects of bioaerosol generation in a controlled environment. However, little comparative characterization exists for nebulizers used in infectious disease aerobiology, including Collison nebulizer, Vibrating mesh nebulizer, and hydraulic spray atomizer. This study characterized the physical features of aerosols generated by laboratory nebulizers, and their performance in producing aerosols at a size relevant to airborne transmission used in infectious disease aerobiology. We also determined the impact of nebulization mechanisms of these nebulizers on the viability of human respiratory viruses, including IAV H1N1, IAV H3N2 and HRV-16.","Niazi, Sadegh; Philp, Lisa K.; Spann, Kirsten; Johnson, Graham R.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.11.435057,52

They have also taken to social media platforms to vigorously argue against the use of masks, and spread misinformation, lies, and myths regarding their use. Even with the advent of vaccines, masks are still likely to be recommended for a long time. It is therefore necessary to identify those tweets that spread falsehoods regarding the use and effectiveness of masks in order to limit their appeal and damage. This paper proposes a classification framework to detect anti-mask tweets from social media dialogue shared on Twitter during the months of July and August 2020. The framework relies on popular machine learning models trained using a combination of linguistic, auxiliary, psycholinguistic and sentiment features for detection. The proposed classification framework can detect anti-mask tweets with excellent accuracy of over 90%, and hence, it can be used to tag tweets that sow misinformation about masks before they spread through the ether and influence people. © 2021 IEEE.","Cerbin, L.; DeJesus, J.; Warnken, J.; Gokhale, S.

The involvement of wildlife and wet markets with the previous outbreaks simultaneously has been brought into sharp focus. Although scientists are yet to ascertain the host range and zoonotic potential of SARS-CoV-2 rigorously, information about its two ancestors, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), is a footprint for research on COVID-19. A 96% genetic similarity with bat coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 indicates that the bat might be a potential reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 just like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, where civets and dromedary camels are considered the potential intermediate host, respectively. Perceiving the genetic similarity between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, many scientists also have given the scheme that the pangolin might be the intermediate host. The involvement of SARS-CoV-2 with other animals, such as mink, snake, and turtle has also been highlighted in different research articles based on the interaction between the key amino acids of S protein in the receptor-binding domain and angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). This study highlights the potential animal reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 and the role of wildlife in the COVID-19 pandemic. Although different causes, such as recurring viral genome recombination, wide genetic assortment, and irksome food habits, have been blamed for this emergence, basic research studies and literature reviews indicate an enormous consortium between humans and animals for the COVID-19 pandemic.","Islam, M.

Interventions The monthly median timings (anaesthetic, surgical, operative) were compared for 15 months (January 2019 - March 2020) preceding the Covid-19 measures being implemented with the subsequent 9 months (April - December 2020). The gynae-onccology, emergency and elective gynaecology groups were analysed separately to allow secondary assessment of the impact of surgical pause on surgical timings. Measurements and Main Results 1565 cases were performed (886 benign elective, 158 emergencies, 522 gynae-oncology) averaging 77 cases/month pre-Covid-19, 27 cases/month in the initial 3 months and 59 cases/month for the subsequent 6 months. The monthly median anaesthetic time increased from 25-31 minutes pre-Covid-19 to 50-53 minutes in the initial 3 months, with a slow return towards baseline over the subsequent 6 months (33-47 minutes). Surgical timings stayed within average monthly fluctuations in gynae-oncology and emergencies, however a clinically significant peak (245 minutes) was observed in benign elective operating times in the first full month of return compared to pre-Covid-19 (46-102 minutes). Conclusion There was a clinically significant increase in operative times following implementation of Covid-19 measures. The widest clinical impact was near doubling of anaesthetic time over the initial 3 months. The 6-week pause in operating also appeared to impact elective benign gynaecological surgical timings, however continued operating in gynae-oncology and emergencies appeared to have a protective effect on timings. These findings can aid effective surgical list planning to allow sufficient time for the additional measures on the return after the larger second wave.","Berry, J.; Munro, S.; Platinescue, L.; Khan, Z.

Based on several previous studies, it is known that online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic greatly influenced students' interest in learning biology. However, it is not yet known the level of interest in learning itself due to the effect of online learning, and it is not yet known the magnitude of the influence of interest in learning biology during online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. This research was conducted in 2nd-grade science in Senior High School No. 13 Semarang using a survey method with correlational analysis. The data collection techniques in this study were questionnaires and documentation which were analyzed by testing the hypothesis using the correlation test and regression test. The results showed that the percentage of students' interest in learning biology online during the COVID-19 pandemic was 68.16%. The results of the correlation test show that there is a relationship between interest in learning biology with the cognitive biology learning outcomes of students. The results of the regression test and the value of R squared indicated that students' interest in learning biology affects learning outcomes of cognitive biology. The percentage of the influence of students' interest in learning biology on the cognitive biology learning outcomes is 34%.

First, a model was developed to predict the worst-case scenario for infections in each state. This was used to support state-level health committees to make local resource planning decisions. Next, as containment interventions resulted in subsistence/daily paid workers losing their income and ability to buy essential food supplies, NGF and MTN agreed a second phase of activity, to develop insights to understand the population clusters at greatest socioeconomic risk from the impact of the pandemic. This insight was used to promote available financial relief to the economically vulnerable population clusters in Lagos state via the HelpNow crowdfunding initiative. This article discusses how anonymized and aggregated mobile network data (MBD), combined with other data sources, were used to create valuable insights and inform the government, and private business, response to the pandemic in Nigeria. Finally, we discuss lessons learnt. Firstly, how a collaboration with, and support from, the regulator enabled MTN to deliver critical insights at a national scale. Secondly, how the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation and the GSMA COVID-19 Privacy Guidelines provided an initial framework to open the discussion and define the approach. Thirdly, why stakeholder management is critical to the understanding, and application, of insights. Fourthly, how existing relationships ease new project collaborations. Finally, how MTN is developing future preparedness by creating a team that is focused on developing data-driven insights for social good.","Gilbert, Joanne Adekanmbi Olubayo Harrison Charlie",Data & Policy,https://doi.org/10.1017/dap.2021.12,52
174447,Human marginal zone B cell development from early T2 progenitors,2020-09-25,"This paper uses the exogenous shock generated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the relative government response as an informative case in investigating the factors able to affect policy efficacy. Lockdown measures have been widely adopted to limit the diffusion of COVID-19, indirectly supporting the capacity of the hospital system to face the pandemic. Lockdown obliges people to change their social behaviour significantly, and consequently is a matter of serious concern among the population. For this reason, how people react to lockdown is of the utmost importance, since failure to observe it properly will be of little benefit in reducing contagion. In this rationale, factors correlated with individuals’ behaviour could affect the efficacy of such measures. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether differences in institutional quality and social capital are correlated with the efficacy of lockdown measures, taking the Italian provinces as a case study. Using a quantitative analysis employing F-GLS estimators, our results suggest that both local social capital and institutional quality have affected the efficiency of lockdown measures in Italian provinces. In general terms these factors contribute to forming the set of incentives able to promote individual behaviour that is in closer compliance with government choices. In this perspective, institutional quality and social capital can be considered factors able to influence the efficacy of policies.

174521,Detection of anti-viral drug riamilovir and herbicides in aqueous media by using pyrene-based fluorescent chemosensors,2021,"BackgroundRevascularization in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with tandem occlusion (TO) is technically challenging due to the involvement of two large vessel occlusions (LVO) in the same vascular territory, usually with a large clot burden. There are two traditional approaches to re-establish the blood flow from TO;initial intracranial mechanical thrombectomy (MT) (head-first) or initial angioplasty ± stenting (neck-first). We developed a novel technique to simultaneously revascularize distal and proximal occlusions. This is accomplished by utilizing a stent-retriever as a distal protection device and a large inner diameter aspiration catheter with a balloon guiding catheter to retrieve clot and prevent distal migration (flow-arrest proximal protection).Subject and MethodsSince January of 2018, we performed MT for 142 LVO in AIS of the anterior circulation, of which we treated 12 TO. For the last six cases of TO, the Novel technique was applied to revascularize and restore perfusion. Patient demographics, procedure time (artery puncture to closure), procedure safety including symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), angiographic outcomes (TICI score), and clinical outcomes (mRS) were evaluated.ResultsThe novel technique procedure in detail: an 8-9-French balloon-guided catheter is advanced to the distal common carotid artery and the balloon is inflated for flow arrest proximal protection. A microcatheter and micro-guidewire are passed through the steno-occlusive site of the proximal internal carotid artery (ICA) and advanced into the M1 segment. After removing the micro-guidewire, a stent-retriever is navigated into the microcatheter and deployed at the distal M1 occlusion. Subsequently, the microcatheter is removed. The stent-retriever promotes flow restoration and captures distal emboli. During several minutes of flow restoration, a balloon angioplasty catheter is navigated to the proximal ICA steno-occlusive site over a stent-retriever wire, and balloon angioplasty is performed. After balloon angioplasty catheter removal, an aspiration catheter is advanced into the internal carotid artery, followed by the M1 segment, over the stent-retriever wire. Clot aspiration, retrieval, and capture of the stent-retriever is then performed. Carotid stenting is not used due to concerns for intracranial hemorrhage related to antiplatelet therapy in the acute phase. Among six patients, the mean age was 68 yo (41 - 83), median NIHSS at presentation was 18 (5 - 24), sICH was 1/6, and mortality was 1/6. One patient died from concomitant COVID-19 pneumonia despite successful revascularization and neurological improvement. TICI IIb or III was achieved in 5/6 patients, and mRS 0-2 was observed in 3/6 patients. The mean procedure time was 122 minutes (89 - 157), which was shorter than the TO group treated with traditional approaches 144 minutes (95 - 184), though this was not statistically significant (p=0.05 t-test). However, with improved experience, the procedure time decreased, and the last two cases’ procedure times were 89 and 91 minutes respectively.ConclusionThe novel technique to revascularize tandem occlusion utilizing a stent-retriever as a distal protection device along with an aspiration catheter and a balloon-guided catheter is feasible. Immediate flow restoration at the distal occlusion site with simultaneous revascularization of the proximal ICA steno-occlusive lesion potentially improves the puncture to reperfusion timeDisclosuresS.

174679,A data compendium of Mycobacterium tuberculosis antibiotic resistance,2021-09-16,"Conformity consumer behavior refers to a preference of using the behaviors or expectations of others as a guideline for one's own consumption patterns. Significant characteristics of conformity consumer behavior have been observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it has greatly hindered resource allocation and pandemic management. Nonetheless, the reasons why a public health emergency, exemplified by COVID-19, triggers conformity consumer behavior remain unclear. This study proposes and tests a theoretical framework to explore the psychological mechanisms of conformity consumer behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results indicate that pandemic severity positively affect conformity consumer behavior, sense of fear plays a mediating role between pandemic severity and conformity consumer behavior, and sense of control does not play a moderating role. This implies that fear drives conformity consumer behavior and people may tend to consume in this way when they perceive a strong sense of fear no matter how strong their sense of control is. The conclusion will help managers to guide consumer behavior during social crisis and emergencies.","Li, J. A.; Jin, X. T.; Zhao, T. Y.; Ma, T.",Sage Open,https://doi.org/10.1177/21582440211032152,52

There is currently no definitive treatment for COVID-19. Colchicine is a drug that can reduce the severity of COVID-19 by inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome. This study aims to determine the effect of colchicine administration on the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HsCRP) and Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) levels in COVID-19 patients. This study was conducted at the UNS Hospital in February-March 2021. The inclusion criteria were moderate-grade COVID-19 patients. HsCRP and NLR examinations were carried out before and after giving the treatment. The treatment group received 2x0.5 mg colchicine for 7 days and standard therapy, while the control group received placebo and standard therapy. Statistical test using paired t-test and independent t-test. P is significant if p is less than 0.05. The study subjects were 40 patients, with 20 patients in the control group and 20 in the treatment group. There was a decrease in NLR and HsCRP levels in the treatment group before therapy (NLR = 7.89 + 3.45;HsCRP = 5.41 + 3.24 mg/dL) compared to after therapy (NLR = 3.59 + 2.25;HsCRP = 1.41 + 1.13 mg/dL) with p = 0.001.

Design/methodology/approach A survey was administered to tasting room visitors at two wineries in October 2020 in the Finger Lakes region of New York State resulting in 215 usable survey responses measuring customer satisfaction. A factor analysis was used to identify primary factors influencing overall CS. The authors then modeled how these primary factors, along with various demographic factors, influence sales metrics. The results are then compared with previous estimates of such drivers in pre-COVID tasting rooms. Findings The authors identified four main CS factors: Staff Interactions, Wine Tasting, COVID-19 Precautions and Ambience that play a significant role in overall CS. Of these, Wine Tasting was shown to have a positive influence on total amount spent and the number of bottles purchased, whereas COVID-19 Precautions positively impacted the number of bottles purchased. Overall, CS is also shown to positively impact total amount spent and number of bottles purchased. Customers are shown to prefer some changes to the tasting room due to COVID-19, such as having table service and reservations.

For example, in video-based learning, learners who are distracted from the video would not follow an alert asking them to pay attention. Inspired by the concept of Mindless Computing, we propose a novel intervention approach, Mindless Attractor, that leverages the nature of human speech communication to help learners refocus their attention without relying on their motivation. Specifically, it perturbs the voice in the video to direct their attention without consuming their conscious awareness. Our experiments not only confirmed the validity of the proposed approach but also emphasized its advantages in combination with a machine learning-based sensing module. Namely, it would not frustrate users even though the intervention is activated by false-positive detection of their attentive state. Our intervention approach can be a reliable way to induce behavioral change in human-AI symbiosis.","Arakawa, Riku; Yakura, Hiromu",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.08621v1.pdf,52

Many states across the U.S. imposed lockdowns in early spring 2020, which reduced demand for trips of various types and affected transportation systems. In urban areas, the shift resulted in a reduction in traffic volumes and an increase in bicycling and walking in certain land use contexts. This paper seeks to understand the changes occurring at signalized intersections as a result of the lockdown and the ongoing pandemic, as well as the actions taken in response to these impacts. The results of a survey of agency reactions to COVID-19 with respect to traffic signal operations and changes in pedestrian activity during the spring 2020 lockdown using two case study examples in Utah are presented. First, the effects of placing intersections on pedestrian recall (with signage) to stop pedestrians from pushing the pedestrian button are examined. Next, the changes in pedestrian activity at Utah signalized intersections between the first 6?months of both 2019 and 2020 are analyzed and the impact of land use characteristics is explored. Survey results reveal the importance of using technologies such as adaptive systems and automated traffic signal performance measures to drive decisions. While pedestrian pushbutton actuations decreased in response to the implementation of pedestrian recalls, many pedestrians continued to use the pushbutton. Pedestrian activity changes were also largely driven by surrounding land uses.","Singleton, Patrick A.; Taylor, Mark Day Christopher Poddar Subhadipto Kothuri Sirisha Sharma Anuj",Transportation Research Record,https://doi.org/10.1177/03611981211026303,52

We describe a general solution to this problem which starts with a broad exploration of the very large space of possible binding modes and interactions, and then intensifies the search in the most promising regions. We demonstrate its very broad applicability by de novo design of binding proteins to 12 diverse protein targets with very different shapes and surface properties. Biophysical characterization shows that the binders, which are all smaller than 65 amino acids, are hyperstable and bind their targets with nanomolar to picomolar affinities. We succeeded in solving crystal structures of four of the binder-target complexes, and all four are very close to the corresponding computational design models. Experimental data on nearly half a million computational designs and hundreds of thousands of point mutants provide detailed feedback on the strengths and limitations of the method and of our current understanding of protein-protein interactions, and should guide improvement of both.

179381,Diversity and dynamics of the CRISPR-Cas systems associated with Bacteroides fragilis in human population,2021-09-09,"To manage the COVID-19 epidemic effectively, decision-makers in public health need accurate forecasts of case numbers. A potential near real-time predictor of future case numbers is human mobility;however, research on the predictive power of mobility is lacking. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel model for epidemic forecasting based on mobility data, called mobility marked Hawkes model. The proposed model consists of three components: (1) A Hawkes process captures the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. (2) A mark modulates the rate of infections, thus accounting for how the reproduction number R varies across space and time. The mark is modeled using a regularized Poisson regression based on mobility covariates. (3) A correction procedure incorporates new cases seeded by people traveling between regions. Our model was evaluated on the COVID-19 epidemic in Switzerland. Specifically, we used mobility data from February through April 2020, amounting to approximately 1.5 billion trips. Trip counts were derived from large-scale telecommunication data, i.e., cell phone pings from the Swisscom network, the largest telecommunication provider in Switzerland. We compared our model against various state-of-the-art baselines in terms of out-of-sample root mean squared error. We found that our model outperformed the baselines by 15.52%. The improvement was consistently achieved across different forecast horizons between 5 and 21 days. In addition, we assessed the predictive power of conventional point of interest data, confirming that telecommunication data is superior. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to predict the spread of COVID-19 from telecommunication data. Altogether, our work contributes to previous research by developing a scalable early warning system for decision-makers in public health tasked with controlling the spread of infectious diseases. © 2021 ACM.","Schwabe, A.; Persson, J.; Feuerriegel, S.","27th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, KDD 2021",https://doi.org/10.1145/3447548.3467157,52
179468,Amino acids whose intracellular levels change most during aging alter chronological lifespan of fission yeast,2020-08-19,"Spatial patterns in genetic diversity are shaped by individuals dispersing from their parents and larger-scale population movements. It has long been appreciated that these patterns of movement shape the underlying genealogies along the genome leading to geographic patterns of isolation by distance in contemporary population genetic data. However, extracting the enormous amount of information contained in genealogies along recombining sequences has, up till recently, not been computational feasible. Here we capitalize on important recent advances in gene-genealogy reconstruction and develop methods to use thousands of trees to estimate time-varying per-generation dispersal rates and to locate the genetic ancestors of a sample back through time. We take a likelihood approach in continuous space using a simple approximate model (branching Brownian motion) as our prior distribution of spatial genealogies. After testing our method with simulations we apply it to the 1001 Genomes dataset of over one thousand Arabidopsis thaliana genomes sampled across a wide geographic extent. We detect a very high dispersal rate in the recent past, especially longitudinally, and use inferred ancestor locations to visualize many examples of recent long-distance dispersal and admixture. We also use inferred ancestor locations to identify the origin and ancestry of the North American expansion and to depict alternative geographic ancestries stemming from multiple glacial refugia. Our method highlights the huge amount of information about past dispersal events and population movements contained in genome-wide genealogies.","Osmond, Matthew M; Coop, Graham",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.13.452277,52

But because nature is viewed only as a resource, sustainability fails to recognize that humans and other living beings depend on each other for their well-being. We therefore argue that true sustainability can only be achieved if the interdependent needs of all species of current and future generations are met, and propose calling this ‘multispecies sustainability’. We explore the concept through visualizations and scenarios, then consider how it might be applied through case studies involving bees and healthy green spaces.Alternate abstract:Technical summaryThe sustainability concept in its current form suffers from reductionism. The common interpretation of ‘meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs’ fails to explicitly recognize their interdependence with needs of current and future non-human generations. Here, we argue that the focus of sustainability on human well-being – a purely utilitarian view of nature as a resource for humanity – limits its conceptual and analytical power, as well as real-world sustainability transformation efforts. We propose a broadened concept of ‘multispecies sustainability’ by acknowledging interdependent needs of multiple species’ current and future generations. We develop the concept in three steps: (1) discussing normative aspects, fundamental principles underlying the concept, and potential visual models, (2) showcasing radically diverging futures emerging from a scenario thought experiment based on the axes sustainable-unsustainable and multispecies-anthropocentric, and (3) exploring how multispecies sustainability can be applied to research and policy-making through two case studies (a multispecies stakeholder framework and the Healthy Urban Microbiome Initiative).Alternate abstract:Social media summaryA new multispecies definition of sustainability recognizes that living beings and their wellbeing are interdependent.","Rupprecht, Christoph D.

Using the 2008 Survey of Income and Program Participation Panel, this longitudinal study traced the footsteps of 7,755 low-income households between 2008 and 2013. This study also compared poor households with their near-poor counterparts with respect to economic resilience vis-à-vis the recession. Descriptive statistics showed that just 41 percent of the sample reached economic resilience in 2013, while multivariate logistic regression results indicated that poor households were 33 percent less resilient than near-poor households. This study holds major implications for policy and research. In fact, macro-level policy changes can have micro-level effects. Because stimulus packages are rare policy interventions, policymakers should ensure that such emergency-type of policy infusion works, including for those at the bottom of the economic pyramid. Meanwhile, by revealing how financial crises and recovery efforts impact disadvantaged populations, the findings in this study have implications for future research. Through their longitudinal focus on disaster relief and economic resilience among low-income households, these findings contribute to the existing literature.

In the context of a large-scale transmission of the new coronavirus infection, it seems very important, relevant, and useful to examine and identify psychological factors affecting the refusal to vaccinate, caused by mistrust or uncertainty about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, doubts about its benefits and concerns about uncontrolled consequences. This study is the first report of the cognitive aspects of students’ attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination that lead to their refusal to vaccinate. Methods. The study involved 76 university students (M = 20.63;SD = 2.38;56 females and 20 males). For data collection, the author used the original questionnaire, aimed at identifying subjective attitudes towards the vaccine and vaccination against COVID-19, and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale by D. K. Ahorsu et al.;data was interpreted using frequency, correlation, and P. Verges’ prototypical analyses. Results and Discussion. Against the background of a predominantly low level of COVID-19 fear, it was revealed that the majority of study participants had a negative attitude towards vaccination, expressed in their refusal of potential vaccination (63 respondents). The most frequent reasons for refusal were mistrust, fear of consequences, unreliability of the vaccine, and the presence of antibodies. It was identified that the central core of representations of the vaccine reflected formally neutral associations, lack of axiological and emotionally charged notions, absence of relevant personal meanings, whereas the periphery included important descriptors indicating ambivalent attitude towards possible consequences of vaccination. The results obtained were interpreted in the context of cognitive aberrations actualized in situations of uncertainty, including exaggeration of one’s own awareness, illusion of competence, imposed delusions, egocentric bias, illusion of control, illusory correlation, and cognitive dissonance. © Ryaguzova Е.

Our HIV testing laboratory, catering to the large population of Delhi and neighboring states, faced many challenges and handled them, during the pandemic, which are discussed.MethodsThe study-setting is the stand-alone Integrated Counseling and Testing Centre (ICTC) for HIV, located in the capital city of New Delhi, India. The study period included a full year from March 2020 to February 2021, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country. Various aspects of the changes in our HIV testing facility during the lockdown were studied, including- changes in footfall, demography of clients, availability of staff and supplies, numbers tested for HIV, HIV positivity and Covid-19 patients tested for HIV.ResultsThe study yielded mixed results, with some parameters showing a decline (numbers tested, female to male ratio, fall in numbers of children and elderly tested for HIV, fall in laboratory errors), some parameters remaining the same (kits and supplies, HIV positivity percentage of 2- 4%), and some other parameters showing a distinct increase in numbers (efficiency of laboratory staff as measured by fall in errors, improvement in competency assessment scores, attendance in training programs and compliance with standard precautions, documentation and record keeping). A totally new parameter included in this study was the testing of Covid-19 positive patients for HIV, with a positivity of 2.08%.ConclusionIn conclusion, this study yielded some interesting revelations on various aspects of working in an HIV testing laboratory.

We demonstrate a critical role for bases upstream of the originally predicted stem-loop, providing evidence for a pseudoknot-like conformation and suggesting that the recognition of this pseudoknot by beta-shell proteins is a conserved feature in cardioviruses. Through examination of PRF in TMEV-infected cells by ribosome profiling, we identify a series of ribosomal pauses around the site of PRF induced by the 2A-pseudoknot complex. Careful normalisation of ribosomal profiling data with a 2A knockout virus facilitated the identification, through disome analysis, of ribosome stacking at the TMEV frameshifting signal.

I argue here that Achille Mbembe’s notion of necropolitics can give us a way into understanding the ways in which this “triage ethos” is baked into the DNA of 21st-century societies. For Mbembe, necropolitics is the deployment of social or political power to govern the exposure of other human beings to the realm of death, whether social, civil, or actual. In this essay, I will extend this notion to argue that the necro- is actually embedded in the very material ethical relations between people.

Methods Phase 1 of this trial (N=42) assessed the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of ascending levels of one-dose ARCT-021, a self-amplifying mRNA vaccine against Covid-19. Phase 2 (N=64) tested two-doses of ARCT-021 given 28 days apart. Both young and older adults were enrolled. The primary safety outcomes were local and systemic solicited adverse events (AEs) reported immediately and up to 7 days post-inoculation and unsolicited events reported up to 56 days after inoculation. Secondary and exploratory outcomes were antibody and T cell responses to vaccination, respectively. Results ARCT-021 was well tolerated up to one 7.5 g dose and two 5.0 g doses. Local solicited AEs, namely injection-site pain and tenderness, as well as systemic solicited AEs, such as fatigue, headache and myalgia, were more common in ARCT-021 than placebo recipients, and in younger than older adults. Seroconversion rate for anti-S IgG was 100% in all cohorts except for the 1 g one-dose in younger adults and the 7.5 g one-dose in older adults, which were each 80%. Neutralizing antibody titers increased with increasing dose although the responses following 5.0 g and 7.5 g ARCT-021 were similar. Anti-S IgG titers overlapped with those in Covid-19 convalescent plasma. ARCT-021 also elicited T-cell responses against the S glycoprotein.

A number of drugs have been repurposed without any remarkable efficacy. Amidst the crisis, utilising immunomodulators for boosting host immunity to mitigate disease severity and infectivity appears a viable option. In this article, we have explored the contemporary scientific evidence about levamisole for its potential use in COVID 19. Though the primary pharmacological use of the drug is as an anthelminthic, its immunostimulatory action has been shown to increase T-cell function, neutrophilic chemotaxis and immunoglobulin production both in vitro and in vivo. Clinically, the drug has been used with limited success in the treatment of herpes and HIV. The potential role of the drug in COVID 19 stems from the fact that the immunostimulant action can initiate a strong immune response and surmount the surreptitious virus, which evades host cell immunity. However, great caution has to be exercised in deciding the dosing schedule because the drug-disease interaction, especially the fatal hyperimmune response, is unknown and unpredictable. Being a widely available drug, enlisted in the WHO List of Essential Medicine, without any major safety issue, the drug is already in clinical trials carrying out worldwide. As the pandemic continues to ravage mankind with unabated intensity, any favourable outcome is eagerly awaited from the ongoing trials with levamisole and other drugs.","Mukhopadhyay, Keshab Dalai Chanchal K.; Singh, Ritesh Ahmed Shah Newaz Banerjee Kushal",Current Drug Therapy,https://doi.org/10.2174/1574885515999201231204530,52

Scientists utilised different approaches for the detection and characterisation of CoVs using samples such as serum, throat swabs, nose swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavages. The two common approaches include antigen-based approach and molecular diagnostic approach, which are hindered by limitations such as low sensitivity and requirement for high level of biosafety during isolation of the virus from cell culture. Thus, there is a need for developing a more rapid, sensitive, simple and cheap diagnostic kit for diagnosis of different strains of coronavirus.

Yet the actual content of an HRBA to health remains unspecific, and therefore implementation remains heterogeneous. This situation is even more challenging in the field of mental health, where human rights considerations are particularly complex and have emerged out of a history of myriad violations. Even when research has been conducted into mental health, it has focused predominantly on the Global North, raising questions of contextual and cultural relevance. Accordingly, this study examined the issue from the perspectives of stakeholders in Kenya who consider their work or the services they use to be rights based. It explored the key principles and interventions deemed to constitute an HRBA to mental health care and psychosocial support, the perceived benefits of such approaches, and the main barriers and supports relevant for implementation. The results produced seven key principles and corresponding interventions. Among other things, it highlighted the importance of economic well-being and self-efficacy, as well as the reduction of barriers to implementation, such as stigma and lack of adequate resourcing. Two key tensions were apparent—namely, the un/acceptability of coercion and the role of traditional and faith-based modalities in an HRBA to mental health care and psychosocial support.","Mahomed, Faraaz; Bhabha, Jacqueline; Stein, Michael Ashley; Pūras, Dainius",Health Hum Rights,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7762899/,52

Furthermore, it is evident from scientific literature that the incidence of deaths and hospitalizations has been increasingly more among COVID-19 subjects with pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD). Various pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed to explain the cardiovascular involvement in COVID-19. Another emerging significant concern is the varying presentations of COVID-19 and side effects due to the medication used in the management of COVID-19 patients. This review attempts to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing literature on the possible association between CVD and COVID-19 with emphasis on the pathophysiological mechanisms, cardiac manifestations, and impact of medications used for COVID-19 on cardiovascular health. Based on the available literature, we conclude that though CVD could not be reckoned as an independent risk factor for COVID-19 infection, it is evident that pre-existing CVD has an influence on the severity of COVID-19 infection and associated mortality. RELEVANCE FOR PATIENTS: Literature suggests that people with pre-existing CVD are at increased risk for COVID-19 and associated severity. Consequently, it becomes important to thoroughly gain insights into the possible pathophysiological mechanisms, cardiac manifestations in COVID-19, and the impact of COVID-19 treatment on the cardiovascular system.","Vudathaneni, Vijaya Krishna Prasad; Nadella, Swetha Bharathi; Lanke, Rama Brahmam; Boyapati, Ramanarayana",J Clin Transl Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8177845/,52

Everything that we have accomplished in the fields of medicine and public health could be undermined if we do not pay attention to these rapid environmental changes. As healers, human beings, and members of the biological community, we need to broaden our perspective on health and disease. Unless we devote our attention to stabilizing and repairing the ecosystem, our professional and personal accomplishments as health professionals may be swept away. Health care providers--particularly physicians--can play a role by adopting an ecosystem health perspective as we ply our trade. By helping people avoid unwanted pregnancies, by using resources parsimoniously, and by staying engaged in the natural world, we can help to prevent the collapse of the biological systems upon which we all depend.","Rosenblatt, Roger A",Annals of family medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15798046/,52
187475,An immunoturbidimetric assay for rapid quantitative measurement of feline alpha-1-acid glycoprotein in serum and peritoneal fluid.,2005,"According to the ""distorted key"" theory as elaborated in a review article years ago (Chou, K.C.: Analytical Biochemistry, 1996, 233, 1-14), the knowledge of the cleavable peptides by SARS-CoV M(pro) (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus main proteinase) can provide very useful insights on developing drugs against SARS. In view of this, the softwares, ZCURVE_CoV 1.0 and ZCURVE_CoV 2.0 (http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/sars/), developed recently for SARS-Coronavirus are used to analyze the 36 complete SARS-Coronavirus RNA sequences in the gene bank NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) from different sources for protein coding genes, and to search for the cleavage sites of SARS-CoV M(pro) in polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab. A total of 396 cleavage points are found in the 36 SARS-Coronavirus and 11 cleavable octapeptides abstracted from the 396 cleavage sites. The statistical distributions of amino acids for the cleavable octapeptides at the subsites R4, R3, R2, R1, R1', R2', R3' and R4' are calculated. The cleavage-specific positions are on R2, R1 and R1', and the positions R3 and R4 are featured by some certain specificity for SARS-CoV M(pro). The structural characters of amino acid residues around the cleavage-specific positions are discussed. Two most promising octapeptides, i.e., NH(2)-ATLQ downward arrowAIAS-COOH and NH(2)-ATLQ downward arrowAENV-COOH, are selected to be the candidates for chemical modification, converting into the inhibitors of SARS-CoV M(pro). A possible strategy to convert a cleavable octapeptide by SARS enzyme into a drug candidate against SARS is elucidated.","Du, Qishi; Wang, Shuqing; Jiang, Zhiqin; Gao, Weina; Li, Yun; Wei, Dongqing; Chou, Kuo-Chen",Medicinal chemistry (Shariqah (United Arab Emirates)),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16787316/,52

DESIGN Phase IIIb, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, prospective, parallel-group, comparative study conducted at 58 centers in 11 countries. PATIENTS AND SETTING Adult patients with signs and symptoms of CAP that was confirmed by radiographic evidence and who did not require parenteral therapy were included in the study. ASSESSMENTS Patients were assessed before treatment, during treatment, after treatment, and at follow-up (28 to 35 days after treatment completion). Clinical response was evaluated. Blood and sputum samples were cultured for bacterial pathogens, and serology testing was performed to detect atypical pneumonia. RESULTS A total of 504 patients were enrolled into the trial: 251 were randomly assigned to receive GFX and 253 to receive CLA. In patients able to be clinically evaluated, clinical success rates at follow-up were 147 of 163 patients (90%) in the GFX group and 148 of 167 patients (89%) in the CLA group (95% confidence interval, -6% to 9%). Pretreatment pathogens were confirmed in 131 of 504 patients (26%), either by culture or serology testing, the primary pathogens being Streptococcus pneumoniae (22%), Haemophilus influenzae (17%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (25%), and Chlamydia pneumoniae (11%). For patients able to be evaluated who had typical pathogens, bacteriologic success was achieved in 92% of the patients in each treatment group. For patients able to be evaluated who had atypical pathogens, 18 of 18 patients (100%) in the GFX and 23 of 26 patients (88%) in the CLA group had a successful clinical outcome. There were similar rates of adverse events in each group, resulting in </= 7% withdrawal from treatment; gastrointestinal events were the most common. CONCLUSIONS GFX, 600 mg qd, was equivalent to CLA, 500 mg bid, in treating adult patients with CAP. Both treatments were well tolerated.","Moola, S; Hagberg, L; Churchyard, G A; Dylewski, J S; Sedani, S; Staley, H",Chest,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10531162/,52

This descriptive cross sectional retrospective study was conducted from 27 May till 20 June 2020. Data were collected retrospectively from three different hospitals of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Patients were interviewed over telephone and verbal consents were taken. Their demographic and clinical profiles were put in the questionnaires by the investigators themselves. Statistical analysis was done thereafter. Out of 226 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 145(61.4%) patients had gastrointestinal symptoms. Five of them had none other than gastrointestinal symptoms. Twenty six patients were asymptomatic. Mean age of the patients with were 41.6±14.8 years. Males were affected almost equally as the females (51.72% vs. 48.27%) (Ratio 1.1:1). Anorexia (44.7%) followed by diarrhoea (35%) and nausea (22.6%) were the predominant symptoms. Patients with co-morbidities (74.7%) were more prone to develop GI symptoms.

189873,SARS coronavirus anti-infectives.,2006,"Replication of poliovirus (PV) genomic RNA in HeLa cells has previously been found to start at distinct sites at the nuclear periphery. In the present study, the earliest steps in the virus replication cycle, i.e. the appearance and intracellular translocation of viral protein and negative-strand RNA prior to positive-strand RNA synthesis, were followed. During translation, positive-strand RNA and newly synthesized viral protein presented as a dispersed endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-like pattern. Concomitant with translation, individual PV vesicle clusters emerged at the ER and formed nascent replication complexes, which contained newly synthesized negative-strand RNA. The complexes rapidly moved centripetally, in a microtubule-dependent way, to the perinuclear area to engage in positive-strand viral RNA synthesis. Replication complexes made transcriptionally silent with guanidine/HCl followed the anterograde membrane pathway to the Golgi complex within the microtubule-organizing centre (MTOC), whereas replication complexes active in positive-strand RNA synthesis were retained at the nuclear periphery. If the silent replication complexes that had accumulated at the MTOC were released from the guanidine block, transcription was not readily resumed. Rather, positive-strand RNA was redistributed back to the ER to start, after a lag phase, translation, followed by negative- and positive-strand RNA synthesis in replication complexes migrating to the nuclear periphery. As some of the findings appear to be in contrast to events reported in cell-free guanidine-synchronized translation/transcription systems, implications for the comparison of in vitro systems with the living cell are discussed.","Egger, Denise; Bienz, Kurt",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15722531/,52

MATERIALS AND METHODS From 2008 to 2010, hand-made slings were used in TOT surgery, whereas commercial slings were used from 2010 to 2013 in our clinic. Overall 102 patients were included in the study. Patients were categorized into 2 groups: group 1 had hand-made (polypropylene monofilament) slings, while group 2 had commercial slings (polypropylene monofilament). We retrospectively reviewed 1-year follow-up results of the whole cohort. Ages, body mass indexes, menopausal status, operation time, cost of sling, success of operation and complications were recorded. All these data were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS There were 41 patients (54.29 ± 9.88 years) in group 1 and 61 patients (52.82 ± 9.85 years) in group 2. Menopausal status and body mass index (28.1 vs. 29.2 kg/m² respectively) were similar for both groups. Previous history of incontinence or pelvic organ prolapse surgery (P = .046), mean duration of the procedure (P = .001), and vaginal extrusion rate (P = .016) were significantly lower in group 2. The cost of the sling was higher in group 2 than in group 1. There was no significant difference in success of operation between the groups (P = .319). CONCLUSION According to our results, hand-made mesh is a viable option in TOT surgery with similar efficacy, but surgeons should be careful in terms of vaginal extrusion.","Ciftci, Seyfettin; Ozkurkcugil, Cuneyd; Ustuner, Murat; Yilmaz, Hasan; Yavuz, Ufuk; Gulecen, Turgay",Urology journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25923154/,52

191190,Use of viral vectors for the development of vaccines.,2007,"Ubiquitin specific protease 7 (USP7) belongs to the family of deubiquitinating enzymes. Among other functions, USP7 is involved in the regulation of stress response pathways, epigenetic silencing and the progress of infections by DNA viruses. USP7 is a 130-kDa protein with a cysteine peptidase core, N- and C-terminal domains required for protein-protein interactions. In the present study, recombinant USP7 full length, along with several variants corresponding to domain deletions, were expressed in different hosts in order to analyze post-translational modifications, oligomerization state, enzymatic properties and subcellular localization patterns of the enzyme. USP7 is phosphorylated at S18 and S963, and ubiquitinated at K869 in mammalian cells. In in vitro activity assays, N- and C-terminal truncations affected the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme different. Both the protease core alone and in combination with the N-terminal domain are over 100-fold less active than the full length enzyme, whereas a construct including the C-terminal region displays a rather small decrease in catalytic efficiency. Limited proteolysis experiments revealed that USP7 variants containing the C-terminal domain interact more tightly with ubiquitin. Besides playing an important role in substrate recognition and processing, this region might be involved in enzyme dimerization. USP7 constructs lacking the N-terminal domain failed to localize in the cell nucleus, but no nuclear localization signal could be mapped within the enzyme's first 70 amino acids. Instead, the tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor-like region (amino acids 70-205) was sufficient to achieve the nuclear localization of the enzyme, suggesting that interaction partners might be required for USP7 nuclear import.","Fernández-Montalván, Amaury; Bouwmeester, Tewis; Joberty, Gerard; Mader, Robert; Mahnke, Marion; Pierrat, Benoit; Schlaeppi, Jean-Marc; Worpenberg, Susanne; Gerhartz, Bernd",The FEBS journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17651432/,52

Primers were selected from the gene coding the F fusion protein, which is relatively conserved among BRSV isolates. The RT-PCR assay was highly specific, it yielded positive reactions only when performed on BRSV-infected cell cultures or tissues. The detection limit of the RT-PCR assay was assessed as 5 TCID50. BRSV was detected in tissues of the respiratory tract and in the tracheobroncheal lymph node of calves euthanized 2-8 days after experimental infection with BRSV, whereas samples of other tissues and samples from mock-infected animals were negative at all time points. Examination of lung samples from 8 different regions of the lungs revealed that although the virus was most often found in the cranioventral lobules, it was frequently present in all lung lobules. Microbiologic examinations of all acute fatal cases of pneumonia (135 animals) in cattle submitted for diagnostic purposes during 1 year revealed that Actinomyces pyogenes (11%), Haemophilus somnus (10%), Pasteurella sp. (7%), and Pasteurella haemolytica (7%) were the most common bacterial agents found in the lungs. BRSV was identified using a conventional antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 23 (17%) animals. The established BRSV-specific RT-PCR assay yielded positive results for the same 23 animals. In addition, 10 animals that were negative with the ELISA were positive with the RT-PCR assay. These results indicates that the RT-PCR assay can be a sensitive, reliable alternative to conventional diagnostic procedures.","Larsen, L E; Tjørnehøj, K; Viuff, B; Jensen, N E; Uttenthal, A","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12968754/,52

The mechanisms through which the virus leads to anosmia/hyposmia is still not fully understood. However, olfaction changes could be used as an indication for testing or quarantine. Screening for infections and other diseases by recognizing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) has been previously conducted. Hence, if the coronavirus infection also results in VOCs excretion, physicians could ""smell"" the virus by using electronic noses. We conducted a literature review on olfaction changes and the COVID-19. Our results suggest that these changes could be used an indication for early testing, even as an isolated symptom. We propose that the electronic nose be used as a future screening tool, especially in agglomeration spaces such as airports, for screening for the COVID-19 infection.","David, Paula; Shoenfeld, Yehuda",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33236562/,52

In Qatar, the situation is dire with reports there is one psychiatrist per 170,000 people in the population. A one-day, student-led mental-health conference was held in Doha, Qatar under the auspices of the World Psychiatric Association with the aim of increasing interest in psychiatry as a career. SUBJECTS AND METHODS In this single-arm, pre-post comparison study, a questionnaire assessing interest in psychiatry as a career was administered on participants before and after attending the conference. Demographic information was obtained and response items were on a 5-point Likert scale. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-sample t-test with a significant p-value set at <0.05. RESULTS The conference was attended by 102 individuals. Fifty-four attendees completed the pre-conference survey (53% response rate) and 36 participants completed the post-conference survey (35% response rate). Data for the 36 matched pre-post responses were included in our analyses. The average age of respondents was 22 years and 81% were female. There was improvement in post-conference results however these changes were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION To the best of our knowledge this is the first intervention study on increasing interest in psychiatry as a career carried out in Qatar. It is likely that psychiatry enthusiasts attended the conference and therefore their interest in this medical specialty was already high as corroborated by the favorable pre-conference survey results. This might explain why there was a lack of statistical significance in comparison to post- intervention scores. We recommend that such an event be integrated into the medical school curricula throughout Qatar to include students with low baseline interest in psychiatry. Further research in this area with more robust methodology is urgently needed to help narrow the pervasive treatment gap.","Hankir, Ahmed; Tom, Abdallah; Ibrahim, Hania; Rifai, Aicha Hind; Shahwar, Durre; Azeem, Muhammad Waqar; Javed, Afzal; Imam, Zainab Kikelomo; Zaman, Rashid",Psychiatria Danubina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32890376/,52

We therefore conducted an analysis to assess if there has been a reduction in new haematological malignancy diagnoses within the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust (BHSCT). Methods We observed a significant decline in diagnostic tests used in the diagnosis of haematological malignancies. We therefore decided to analyse the impact of COVID-19 on the volume of tests performed to see if this impacted the number of new cases of haematological malignancies diagnosed. To ascertain the number of new diagnoses referred to Clinical Haematology we decided to analyse the number of new diagnoses discussed at the local Multidisciplinary Team Meetings (MDM) between March and June 2020 and compare this with the same period in 2019. In line with NICE guidelines2 there has been no change to the referral pathway for patients with new haematological malignancy. Results Results show that there is no significant difference between the number of new malignant haematological diagnoses discussed during March to June 2020 and the same period in 2019. This confirms that the number of new diagnoses remains the same within the two time periods.

COVID-19 virus can attack multiple organs through binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and further induce systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation. In the last issue of 2020 AJNMMI (http://www.ajnmmi.us), Lima et al. summarized current biological complications of COVID-19, their underlying mechanisms, and our options of mapping these functional sequelae using nuclear imaging techniques. Four major organs, including the lung, heart, kidney, and endothelium, were identified as most vulnerable to COVID-19 viruses in severe patients. Nuclear medicine proved accurate and sensitive in assessing the onset, progression, and treatment of COVID-19 patients. By choosing the most appropriate radiotracers and imaging methods, clinicians and researchers are able to analyze and monitor the presence of inflammation, fibrosis, and changes of metabolic rates in organs of interest. With these desirable nuclear imaging methods, systematic evaluation of COVID-19, from its onset to functional sequela, can be achieved with rational patient stratification and timely treatment monitoring, which we believe will eventually lead to full victory against the pandemic.","Jiang, Dawei; Hong, Hao",American journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33688456/,52

A full-scale, on-site study was initiated to test the effectiveness of adding the photocatalyst to various air quality control equipments; that is, fixed full-covering type (FF type), underneath swinging type (US type), and lateral swinging type (LS type). Results from this study indicate that the FF type has the best bacterial restraining rate (81%) as compared with the LS type (66%) and the US type (61%). Similar results are obtained at different heights (90 and 180 cm) of the nursing institutions, revealing that freshly disinfected air is provided regardless of location as long as the air quality control equipment is in operation. The proposed equipment can disinfect air to effectively restrain bacteria as demonstrated on-site in medical nursing institutions; the results will also be for designing integrated, commercialized, large-scale applications in the future.","Zhao, Yu-Kuang; Sung, Wen-Pei; Tsai, Tzai-Tang; Wang, Hsien-Jung",Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20397563/,52
198439,The human/animal interface: emergence and resurgence of zoonotic infectious diseases.,2007,"BACKGROUND several studies have shown an association between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cognitive impairment. These studies have been limited by methodological issues such as diagnostic uncertainty, cross-sectional design, small sample size, or lack of appropriate referent group. This study aimed to elucidate the association between COPD and the risk of cognitive impairment compared to referent subjects without COPD. In patients with established COPD, we evaluated the impact of disease severity and impairment of respiratory physiology on cognitive impairment and the potential mitigating role of oxygen therapy. METHODS we used the Function, Living, Outcomes and Work (FLOW) cohort study of adults with COPD (n = 1202) and referent subjects matched by age, sex, and race (n = 302) to study the potential risk factors for cognitive impairment among subjects with COPD. Cognitive impairment was defined as a Mini-Mental State Exam score of <24 points. Disease severity was using Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV(1)); the validated COPD Severity Score; and the BMI (Body Mass Index), Obstruction, Dyspnea, Exercise Capacity (BODE) Index. Multivariable analysis was used to control for confounding by age, sex, race, educational attainment, and cigarette smoking. RESULTS COPD was associated with a substantive risk of cognitive impairment compared to referent subjects (odds ratio [OR] 2.42; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.043-6.64). Among COPD patients, none of the COPD severity measures were associated with the risk of cognitive impairment (P > 0.20 in all cases). Low baseline oxygen saturation was related to increased risk of cognitive impairment (OR for oxygen saturation ≤88% (OR 5.45; 95% CI 1.014-29.2; P = 0.048). Conversely, regular use of supplemental oxygen therapy decreased the risk for cognitive impairment (OR 0.14; 95% CI 0.07-0.27; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION COPD is a major risk factor for cognitive impairment. Among patients with COPD, hypoxemia is a major contributor and regular use of home oxygen is protective. Health care providers should consider screening their COPD patients for cognitive impairment.","Thakur, Neeta; Blanc, Paul D; Julian, Laura J; Yelin, Edward H; Katz, Patricia P; Sidney, Stephen; Iribarren, Carlos; Eisner, Mark D",International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20856825/,52
198538,Re-emerging diseases and epidemic threats: Ten 'areas of actions' (AA-10) and a case for global solidarity.,2017,"Paramyxoviruses such as human parainfluenza viruses that bear inserts encoding protective antigens of heterologous viruses can induce an effective immunity against the heterologous viruses in experimental animals. However, vectors based on common human pathogens would be expected to be restricted in replication in the adult human population due to high seroprevalence, an effect that would reduce vector immunogenicity. To address this issue, we evaluated Newcastle disease virus (NDV), an avian paramyxovirus that is serotypically distinct from common human pathogens, as a vaccine vector. Two strains were evaluated: the attenuated vaccine strain LaSota (NDV-LS) that replicates mostly in the chicken respiratory tract and the Beaudette C (NDV-BC) strain of intermediate virulence that produces mild systemic infection in chickens. A recombinant version of each virus was modified by the insertion, between the P and M genes, of a gene cassette encoding the human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein, a test antigen with considerable historic data. The recombinant viruses were administered to African green monkeys (NDV-BC and NDV-LS) and rhesus monkeys (NDV-BC only) by combined intranasal and intratracheal routes at a dose of 10(6.5) PFU per site, with a second equivalent dose administered 28 days later. Little or no virus shedding was detected in nose-throat swabs or tracheal lavages following immunization with either strain. In a separate experiment, direct examination of lung tissue confirmed a highly attenuated, restricted pattern of replication by parental NDV-BC. The serum antibody response to the foreign HN protein induced by the first immunization with either NDV vector was somewhat less than that observed following a wild-type HPIV3 infection; however, the titer following the second dose exceeded that observed with HPIV3 infection, even though HPIV3 replicates much more efficiently than NDV in these animals. NDV appears to be a promising vector for the development of vaccines for humans; one application would be in controlling localized outbreaks of emerging pathogens.","Bukreyev, Alexander; Huang, Zhuhui; Yang, Lijuan; Elankumaran, Subbiah; St Claire, Marisa; Murphy, Brian R; Samal, Siba K; Collins, Peter L",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16227250/,52

Besides the threat posed by the global proliferation of BW technologies, there are numerous emerging and reemerging ID agents with significant public health consequences. Further compounding this already complicated situation are the estimated 600 million international tourists annually, many with the potential to the spread disease globally in a matter of hours. While clinical laboratories have key roles in the detection and identification of potential ID/BW agents, most staff are unfamiliar with these agents because of their rarity and the often laborious conventional methodologies needed to identify them. To meet this challenge, a vast array of rapid assay strategies has been developed for use in clinical diagnostics and environmental detection. Technologies have been developed or adapted to the challenges posed by these agents, permitting detection and identification in several minutes to hours. In particular, the development of improved reagents and detection systems has led to dramatic improvements in the sensitivity and specificity of immunological and nucleic acid-based systems, allowing an ever-increasing range of analytes to be identified and quantitated. In the accompanying articles, we have brought together experts from the many overlapping aspects of this arena in order to present a comprehensive and critical analysis of these technologies.","Peruski, Leonard F; Peruski, Anne Harwood",BioTechniques,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14579750/,52

205534,A rapid and highly sensitive UPLC-ESI-MS/MS method for the analysis of the fatty acid profile of edible vegetable oils,2020,"Vascular endothelial cells (EC) form a critical interface between blood and tissues that maintains whole-body homeostasis. In COVID-19, disruption of the EC barrier results in edema, vascular inflammation, and coagulation, the hallmarks of the severe disease. However, the mechanisms by which EC are dysregulated in COVID-19 are unclear. Here, we show that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 alone activates the EC inflammatory phenotype in a manner dependent on integrin 5{beta}1 signaling. Incubation of human umbilical vein EC with whole spike, its receptor-binding domain, or the integrin-binding tripeptide RGD induced the nuclear translocation of NF-{kappa}B and enhanced the expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules VCAM1 and ICAM1, the adhesion of peripheral blood leukocytes, and the permeability of the monolayer. Inhibitors of integrin 5{beta}1 activation prevented these effects. We suggest that the spike protein, through its RGD motif in the receptor-binding domain, binds to integrin 5{beta}1 in EC to activate Rho GTPases, eNOS pathways, and the NF-{kappa}B gene expression program responsible for vascular leakage and leukocyte infiltration, respectively. These findings uncover a new direct action of SARS-CoV-2 on EC dysfunction and introduce integrin 5{beta}1 as a promising target for treating vascular inflammation in COVID-19.","Robles, Juan Pablo; Zamora, Magdalena; Escalera, Gonzalo Martinez de la; Clapp, Carmen",,,52

207378,Seizures associated with coronavirus infections,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), involves several organs through participation of angiotensin-conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. The presence of ACE2 receptors in the liver renders this organ a potential target for the novel coronavirus. METHODS: We performed 14 complete autopsies of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. In each case we stained liver tissue sections with haematoxylin/eosin, Masson blue trichrome stain, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), Perls, and performed cytokeratin-7 (CK7) immunochemistry. RESULTS: Macroscopically, livers were pale and yellowish in 8 of 14 (57%) patients, and had a nutmeg appearance in the other 6 cases (42%). Histologically, centrolobular necrosis was observed in 12 cases (86%), and was associated with discreet to moderate lobular or portal inflammation. Steatosis was seen in 8 cases (57%), but fibrosis was rare. Cholestasis and discrete bile duct proliferation was observed in 5 cases (36%). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The main histological changes can be explained by the hypoxic status as a result of severe hypoxemic pneumonia leading to death. Drug toxicity may also play a role in certain cases. Other histological changes may be explained by previous hepatic conditions or underlying hepatic diseases. We concluded that COVID-19 infection was not associated with a specific histopathological pattern of the liver.","Schmit, Grégory; Lelotte, Julie; Vanhaebost, Jessica; Horsmans, Yves; Van Bockstal, Mieke; Baldin, Pamela",Pathobiology,,52

210760,On-Chip Optical Detection of Viruses: A Review,2021,"PURPOSE: Isolated aspergillus laryngitis is rare and often diagnosed after surgical excision or biopsy for a suspected premalignant or malignant pathology. Unlike other systemic or localized aspergillosis, there are no specific guidelines for isolated laryngeal aspergillosis. Our experience of dealing with a wide variety of isolated laryngeal aspergillosis showed that this entity is very responsive to medical therapy, making extensive debridement (as often carried out in surgically accessible aspergillosis) unnecessary as it would invariably lead to long-term dysphonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all cases of isolated aspergillus laryngitis that presented to our hospital over the past 5 years was carried out. All patients with confirmed histopathological diagnosis of aspergillus infection were included. RESULTS: Twelve patients (five males and seven females) aged 28-54 years, who were diagnosed with aspergillus laryngitis presented with dysphonia. The most common involved site was the true vocal cords. All patients underwent cautious biopsies either in the operating theatre or in-office using a channeled fiber-optic laryngoscope. On histopathological examination, eight had invasive aspergillus infection while others showed variety of noninvasive involvement including colonization of cysts and carcinoma in situ. The most common species isolated was Aspergillus fumigatus. Appropriate antifungal chemotherapy was prescribed after ruling out systemic involvement. None of the patients showed recurrence or residual lesions on follow-up and reported significantly improved voice. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the wide spectrum of presentation of isolated aspergillus laryngitis with Aspergillus fumigatus being the most common organism isolated. Even the invasive variant is a medically treatable condition with voriconazole being the drug of choice. The importance of cautious biopsies and resections for voice preservation is also emphasized. To our knowledge, this is the largest report on isolated aspergillus laryngitis.","Sheth, Meet Chetan; Paul, Roshna Rose; Mathews, Suma Susan; Albert, Rita Ruby",J. voice,,52
211246,Increased plasma level of apelin with NYHA grade II and III but not IV,2020,"BACKGROUND: Cardiac involvement among hospitalized patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is common and associated with adverse outcomes. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and clinical implications of COVID-19 cardiac involvement in young competitive athletes. METHODS: In this prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study with data from 42 colleges and universities, we assessed the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of COVID-19 cardiac involvement among collegiate athletes in the United States. Data were collected from September 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020. The primary outcome was the prevalence of definite, probable, or possible COVID-19 cardiac involvement based on imaging definitions adapted from the Updated Lake Louise Imaging Criteria. Secondary outcomes included the diagnostic yield of cardiac testing, predictors for cardiac involvement, and adverse cardiovascular events or hospitalizations. RESULTS: Among 19 378 athletes tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, 3018 (mean age, 20 years [SD, 1 year]; 32% female) tested positive and underwent cardiac evaluation. A total of 2820 athletes underwent at least 1 element of cardiac triad testing (12-lead ECG, troponin, transthoracic echocardiography) followed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) if clinically indicated. In contrast, primary screening CMR was performed in 198 athletes. Abnormal findings suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 cardiac involvement were detected by ECG (21 of 2999 [0.7%]), cardiac troponin (24 of 2719 [0.9%]), and transthoracic echocardiography (24 of 2556 [0.9%]). Definite, probable, or possible SARS-CoV-2 cardiac involvement was identified in 21 of 3018 (0.7%) athletes, including 15 of 2820 (0.5%) who underwent clinically indicated CMR (n=119) and 6 of 198 (3.0%) who underwent primary screening CMR. Accordingly, the diagnostic yield of CMR for SARS-CoV-2 cardiac involvement was 4.2 times higher for a clinically indicated CMR (15 of 119 [12.6%]) versus a primary screening CMR (6 of 198 [3.0%]). After adjustment for race and sex, predictors of SARS-CoV-2 cardiac involvement included cardiopulmonary symptoms (odds ratio, 3.1 [95% CI, 1.2, 7.7]) or at least 1 abnormal triad test result (odds ratio, 37.4 [95% CI, 13.3, 105.3]). Five (0.2%) athletes required hospitalization for noncardiac complications of COVID-19. During clinical surveillance (median follow-up, 113 days [interquartile range=90â146]), there was 1 (0.03%) adverse cardiac event, likely unrelated to SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection among young competitive athletes is associated with a low prevalence of cardiac involvement and a low risk of clinical events in short-term follow-up.","Moulson, Nathaniel; Petek, Bradley J; Drezner, Jonathan A; Harmon, Kimberly G; Kliethermes, Stephanie A; Patel, Manesh R; Baggish, Aaron L",Circulation,,52
211978,Transdermal drug delivery systems for fighting common viral infectious diseases,2021,"BACKGROUNDRecent studies have reported T cell immunity to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in unexposed donors, possibly due to crossrecognition by T cells specific for common cold coronaviruses (CCCs). True T cell crossreactivity, defined as the recognition by a single TCR of more than one distinct peptide-MHC ligand, has never been shown in the context of SARS-CoV-2.METHODSWe used the viral functional expansion of specific T cells (ViraFEST) platform to identify T cell responses crossreactive for the spike (S) glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 and CCCs at the T cell receptor (TCR) clonotype level in convalescent COVID-19 patients (CCPs) and SARS-CoV-2-unexposed donors. Confirmation of SARS-CoV-2/CCC crossreactivity and assessments of functional avidity were performed using a TCR cloning and transfection system.RESULTSMemory CD4+ T cell clonotypes that crossrecognized the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and at least one other CCC were detected in 65% of CCPs and unexposed donors. Several of these TCRs were shared among multiple donors. Crossreactive T cells demonstrated significantly impaired SARS-CoV-2-specific proliferation in vitro relative to monospecific CD4+ T cells, which was consistent with lower functional avidity of their TCRs for SARS-CoV-2 relative to CCC.CONCLUSIONSOur data confirm, for what we believe is the first time, the existence of unique memory CD4+ T cell clonotypes crossrecognizing SARS-CoV-2 and CCCs. The lower avidity of crossreactive TCRs for SARS-CoV-2 may be the result of antigenic imprinting, such that preexisting CCC-specific memory T cells have reduced expansive capacity upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are needed to determine how these crossreactive T cell responses affect clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients.FUNDINGNIH funding (U54CA260492, P30CA006973, P41EB028239, R01AI153349, R01AI145435-A1, R21AI149760, and U19A1088791) was provided by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the National Cancer Institute, and the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering.

Subsequently, the complete genomes of cell-cultured PDCoV HNZK-02 passage 5 and 15 were sequenced and analyzed. There was a continuous 3-nucleotide deletion and 7 amino acid changes in S genes when compared with the other reported PDCoVs. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)-based transcriptome analysis was used to quantitatively identify differentially expressed genes after PDCoV infection in ST cells. In total, 523 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, including 62 upregulated genes and 457 downregulated genes. The 62 upregulated genes were associated with TNF signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling, chemokine signaling pathway and NF-&#954;B signaling pathway. The significant expressing changed genes, including three antiviral genes (Mx1, OASL, OAS1) and three inflammatory chemokine related genes (CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL10) were further validated using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay. It showed the consistent expression patterns of the candidate genes with those from RNA-seq. Our results demonstrated that PDCoV infection activates NF-&#954;B signaling pathway and leads to the expression of inflammatory factors, which may be related to TLRs but TLR2 is not a critical factor.In general, these results can help us to confirm the molecular regulation mechanism and also provide us a comprehensive resource of PDCoV infection.","Jin, Xiao-Hui; Zhang, Yun-Fei; Yuan, Yi-Xin; Han, Li; Zhang, Gai-Ping; Hu, Hui",Mol Immunol,,52
215251,B-Cell Memory Responses to Variant Viral Antigens,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic causes museums to seek financial aid from corporate sponsors. However, corporate sponsorship may have negative consequences for museums in terms of their authenticity. In this study, we therefore examine whether the extraordinary circumstances caused by the COVID-19 crisis change tourists' perceptions of corporate sponsorship. Indeed, we find that tourists react more positively to corporate sponsorship if the health crisis is salient. Moreover, we show that corporate sponsorship by multiple smaller- and medium-sized companies generates more positive outcomes for museums than the effort of a single large company, in terms of perceived authenticity loss, visiting intentions, and willingness to pay.","Biraglia, Alessandro; Gerrath, Maximilian H E E",Ann Tour Res,,52

We aim to evaluate the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) post-ICU in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Twenty-one COVID-19 patients were evaluated pre- and post-PR and compared retrospectively to a non-COVID-19 group of 21 patients rehabilitated after ICU admission due to respiratory failure. RESULTS: PR induced greater 6-min walking distance improvement in COVID-19 patients (+205 ± 121 m) than in other respiratory failure patients post-ICU (+93 ± 66 m). The sooner PR was performed post-ICU, the better patients recovered. CONCLUSIONS: PR induced large functional improvements in COVID-19 patients post-ICU although significant physical and psychosocial impairments remained post-PR.","Al Chikhanie, Y; Veale, D; Schoeffler, M; Pépin, J L; Verges, S; Hérengt, F",Respir Physiol Neurobiol,,52

However, there are four known, endemic seasonal coronaviruses in humans (HCoVs) and whether antibodies for these HCoVs play a role in severity of COVID-19 disease has generated a lot of interest. Of these seasonal viruses NL63 is of particular interest as it uses the same cell entry receptor as SARS-CoV-2.We use functional, neutralising assays to investigate cross reactive antibodies and their relationship with COVID-19 severity. We analysed neutralisation of SARS-CoV-2, NL63, HKU1, and 229E in 38 COVID-19 patients and 62 healthcare workers, and a further 182 samples to specifically study the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and NL63.We found that although HCoV neutralisation was very common there was little evidence that these antibodies neutralised SARS-CoV-2. Despite no evidence in cross neutralisation, levels of NL63 neutralisating antibodies become elevated after exposure to SARS-CoV-2 through infection or following vaccination.","Wells, David A; Cantoni, Diego; Mayora-Neto, Martin; Genova, Cecilia Di; Sampson, Alexander; Ferrari, Matteo; Carnell, George; Nadesalingam, Angalee; Smith, Peter; Chan, Andrew; Raddi, Gianmarco; Castillo-Olivares, Javier; Baxendale, Helen; Temperton, Nigel; Heeney, Jonathan",,,52

We describe the case of an orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in a young female who presented with acute liver failure secondary to acetaminophen toxicity to manage abdominal pain and in the setting of a positive SARS-CoV2 test. Despite a positive test, she had no respiratory symptoms at time of presentation. The positive test was thought to be residual viral load. The patient had a very favorable outcome, likely related to multiple factors including her young age, lack of respiratory COVID-19 manifestations and plasma exchange peri-operatively. We recommend a full work-up for OLT in COVID-19 patients with uncomplicated disease according to standard of care, with careful interpretation of COVID-19 testing in patients presenting with conditions requiring urgent or emergent surgery as well as repeat testing even a few days after initial testing, as this could alter management.","Rouphael, Carol; D039,; Amico, Giuseppe; Ricci, Kristin; Cywinski, Jacek; Miranda, Cyndee; Koval, Christine; Duggal, Abhijit; Quintini, Cristiano; Menon, K V Narayanan; Miller, Charles; Modaresi Esfeh, Jamak",Am. j. transplant,,52

To provide insight into whether these genetic similarities inform common modes of recognition, we determine the structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike in complex with three VH1-2-derived antibodies: 2-15, 2-43, and H4. All three use VH1-2-encoded motifs to recognize the receptor-binding domain (RBD), with heavy-chain N53I-enhancing binding and light-chain tyrosines recognizing F486RBD. Despite these similarities, class members bind both RBD-up and -down conformations of the spike, with a subset of antibodies using elongated CDRH3s to recognize glycan N343 on a neighboring RBD-a quaternary interaction accommodated by an increase in RBD separation of up to 12 Å. The VH1-2 antibody class, thus, uses modular recognition encoded by modular genetic elements to effect potent neutralization, with the VH-gene component specifying recognition of RBD and the CDRH3 component specifying quaternary interactions.","Rapp, Micah; Guo, Yicheng; Reddem, Eswar R; Yu, Jian; Liu, Lihong; Wang, Pengfei; Cerutti, Gabriele; Katsamba, Phinikoula; Bimela, Jude S; Bahna, Fabiana A; Mannepalli, Seetha M; Zhang, Baoshan; Kwong, Peter D; Huang, Yaoxing; Ho, David D; Shapiro, Lawrence; Sheng, Zizhang",Cell Rep,,52

223983,Advances of Inorganic Materials in the Detection and Therapeutic Uses Against Coronaviruses,2021,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2) was spreading rapidly in South Korea at the end of February 2020 following its initial outbreak in China, making Korea the new center of global attention. The role of social media amid the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has often been criticized, but little systematic research has been conducted on this issue. Social media functions as a convenient source of information in pandemic situations. OBJECTIVE: Few infodemiology studies have applied network analysis in conjunction with content analysis. This study investigates information transmission networks and news-sharing behaviors regarding COVID-19 on Twitter in Korea. The real time aggregation of social media data can serve as a starting point for designing strategic messages for health campaigns and establishing an effective communication system during this outbreak. METHODS: Korean COVID-19-related Twitter data were collected on February 29, 2020. Our final sample comprised of 43,832 users and 78,233 relationships on Twitter. We generated four networks in terms of key issues regarding COVID-19 in Korea. This study comparatively investigates how COVID-19-related issues have circulated on Twitter through network analysis. Next, we classified top news channels shared via tweets. Lastly, we conducted a content analysis of news frames used in the top-shared sources. RESULTS: The network analysis suggests that the spread of information was faster in the Coronavirus network than in the other networks (Corona19, Shincheon, and Daegu). People who used the word ""Coronavirus"" communicated more frequently with each other. The spread of information was faster, and the diameter value was lower than for those who used other terms. Many of the news items highlighted the positive roles being played by individuals and groups, directing readers' attention to the crisis. Ethical issues such as deviant behavior among the population and an entertainment frame highlighting celebrity donations also emerged often. There was a significant difference in the use of nonportal (n=14) and portal news (n=26) sites between the four network types. The news frames used in the top sources were similar across the networks (P=.89, 95% CI 0.004-0.006). Tweets containing medically framed news articles (mean 7.571, SD 1.988) were found to be more popular than tweets that included news articles adopting nonmedical frames (mean 5.060, SD 2.904; N=40, P=.03, 95% CI 0.169-4.852). CONCLUSIONS: Most of the popular news on Twitter had nonmedical frames. Nevertheless, the spillover effect of the news articles that delivered medical information about COVID-19 was greater than that of news with nonmedical frames. Social media network analytics cannot replace the work of public health officials; however, monitoring public conversations and media news that propagates rapidly can assist public health professionals in their complex and fast-paced decision-making processes.","Park, Han Woo; Park, Sejung; Chong, Miyoung",J Med Internet Res,,52

226653,Incipient need of targeting airway remodeling using advanced drug delivery in chronic respiratory diseases,2020,"BACKGROUND: The missing asymptomatic COVID-19 infections have been overlooked because of the imperfect sensitivity of the nucleic acid testing (NAT). Globally understanding the humoral immunity in asymptomatic carriers will provide scientific knowledge for developing serological tests, improving early identification, and implementing more rational control strategies against the pandemic. MEASURE: Utilizing both NAT and commercial kits for serum IgM and IgG antibodies, we extensively screened 11 766 epidemiologically suspected individuals on enrollment and 63 asymptomatic individuals were detected and recruited. Sixty-three healthy individuals and 51 mild patients without any preexisting conditions were set as controls. Serum IgM and IgG profiles were further probed using a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray, and neutralizing antibody was detected by a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay system. The dynamics of antibodies were analyzed with exposure time or symptoms onset. RESULTS: A combination test of NAT and serological testing for IgM antibody discovered 55.5% of the total of 63 asymptomatic infections, which significantly raises the detection sensitivity when compared with the NAT alone (19%). Serum proteome microarray analysis demonstrated that asymptomatics mainly produced IgM and IgG antibodies against S1 and N proteins out of 20 proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Different from strong and persistent N-specific antibodies, S1-specific IgM responses, which evolved in asymptomatic individuals as early as the seventh day after exposure, peaked on days from 17 days to 25 days, and then disappeared in two months, might be used as an early diagnostic biomarker. 11.8% (6/51) mild patients and 38.1% (24/63) asymptomatic individuals did not produce neutralizing antibody. In particular, neutralizing antibody in asymptomatics gradually vanished in two months. CONCLUSION: Our findings might have important implications for the definition of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections, diagnosis, serological survey, public health, and immunization strategies.","Lei, Qing; Li, Yang; Hou, Hong-Yan; Wang, Feng; Ouyang, Zhu-Qing; Zhang, Yandi; Lai, Dan-Yun; Banga Ndzouboukou, Jo-Lewis; Xu, Zhao-Wei; Zhang, Bo; Chen, Hong; Xue, Jun-Biao; Lin, Xiao-Song; Zheng, Yun-Xiao; Yao, Zong-Jie; Wang, Xue-Ning; Yu, Cai-Zheng; Jiang, He-Wei; Zhang, Hai-Nan; Qi, Huan; Guo, Shu-Juan; Huang, Sheng-Hai; Sun, Zi-Yong; Tao, Sheng-Ce; Fan, Xiong-Lin",Allergy,,52

METHODS: Using the terms: ""Dialysis"" OR ""RRT"" OR ""Renal replacement therapy"" AND ""SARS-COV-2"" OR ""COVID-19"" OR ""novel coronavirus"" OR ""2019-nCov"", we performed a multi-step systematic search of the literature in the English language in Pubmed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science published from December 1, 2019, to May 13, 2020. Two authors separately screened the title and abstracts of the documents and ruled out irrelevant articles. We obtained a full report of the papers that met our inclusion criteria and screened the full texts. We conducted a descriptive analysis of the characteristics of the included articles and performed a narrative synthesis of the results. We conducted this scoping review in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR Checklist. RESULTS: We included 22 articles in this scoping review. Perspectives (n = 9), editorials (n = 4), and case series (n = 5) were the most common types of articles. Most articles were from Italy and the United States. Seventeen (77.3%) of the articles focused on the topic of recommendation for outpatient hemodialysis units. While many of the recommendations overlapped in several articles, there were also many unique recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: most of the articles are based on single-center experience, which spontaneously developed best practices. Many of these practices have formed the basis for policies and guidelines that will guide future prevention of infection and management of patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and COVID-19.","Akbarialiabad, Hossein; Kavousi, Shahin; Ghahramani, Aria; Bastani, Bahar; Ghahramani, Nasrollah",BMC Nephrol,,52

The theme of his accumulated work was advancing child development as social action for children and families. Besides early childhood intervention and policy, for which he devoted most of his time, Dr. Zigler did pioneering work in education and school reform, social policy, prevention, child maltreatment, family support, developmental disabilities, and in service to government. In this article, I reflect on four of Dr. Zigler's major contributions to science and society that are underrated and, in many respects, under-appreciated in the larger context of the field. These are (a) historical analysis of Head Start, (b) conceptualization and analysis of motivation as a key component of early childhood program impacts, (c) development of preschool-to-third-grade programs and school reforms, and (d) critical analysis of theory, research, policy, and practice.

Timely diagnosis and treatment may be lifesaving. We report two cases demonstrating different and rare forms of severe brain involvement in adult patients with HLH: acute necrotizing encephalopathy, and diffuse hemorrhagic disease due to disseminated intravascular coagulation. Severe HLH with brain involvement in adults is rare. HLH with cerebral involvement should be considered in patients presenting with severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) but negative cultures and unusual or unexpectedly severe clinical and/or radiologic signs of cerebral dysfunction. Similar brain injury may occur in patients with cytokine storm syndrome due to COVID-19. BACKGROUND: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) presents with fevers, rash, organomegaly, cytopenia, and increased triglycerides and ferritin (Ramos-Casals et al., 2014) [1]. Neurologic abnormalities are reported in about one-third of patients (Cai et al., 2017), including a few cases of acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) (Xiujuan et al., 2015).

Thus, the (Diebold and Yilmaz in Int J Forecast 28(1): 57-66, 2012) result implied that the world pandemic uncertainty contributed a significantly huge shock to the examined pharmaceutical compounds, thus affirming the vulnerability of certain pharmaceuticals to pandemic-related uncertainty. The total spillover increased from 34.2% (with economic policy uncertainty) to 47.6% (when pandemic uncertainty is incorporated). In specific, there are negative net spillovers from the multivitamins, other vitamins, antidiabetic, and antidepressant especially due to high pandemic and economic policy uncertainties. However, the statistical evidence implied that higher uncertainty arising from the pandemic is responsible for the severity of shock received by the indicated pharmaceutical products as against economic policy uncertainty. Thus, a relevant policy inference is posited from the result of the study.","Alola, Andrew Adewale; Olowu, Funmilayo Boluwatife",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,,52

252580,The role of respiratory droplet physicochemistry in limiting and promoting the airborne transmission of human coronaviruses: A critical review,2020,"BACKGROUND: Japan implemented a large-scale quarantine on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in an attempt to control the spread of the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in February 2020. OBJECTIVE: We aim to describe the medical activities initiated and difficulties in implementing quarantine on a cruise ship. METHODS: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for SARS-CoV-2 were performed for all 3711 people (2666 passengers and 1045 crew) on board. RESULTS: Of those tested, 696 (18.8%) tested positive for coronavirus disease (COVID-19), of which 410 (58.9%) were asymptomatic. We also confirmed that 54% of the asymptomatic patients with a positive RT-PCR result had lung opacities on chest computed tomography. There were many difficulties in implementing quarantine, such as creating a dividing traffic line between infectious and noninfectious passengers, finding hospitals and transportation providers willing to accept these patients, transporting individuals, language barriers, and supporting daily life. As of March 8, 2020, 31 patients (4.5% of patients with positive RT-PCR results) were hospitalized and required ventilator support or intensive care, and 7 patients (1.0% of patients with positive RT-PCR results) had died. CONCLUSIONS: There were several difficulties in implementing large-scale quarantine and obtaining medical support on the cruise ship. In the future, we need to prepare for patients' transfer and the admitting hospitals when disembarking the passengers. We recommend treating the crew the same way as the passengers to control the infection. We must also draw a plan for the future, to protect travelers and passengers from emerging infectious diseases on cruise ships.","Yamahata, Yoshihiro; Shibata, Ayako",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,52

Therefore, safe and effective vaccines that could be available within a short time frame after an outbreak are required for adequate prevention and control. Here, we developed a robust and versatile self-assembling multimeric protein scaffold particle (MPSP) vaccine platform using lumazine synthase (LS) from Aquifex aeolicus. This scaffold allowed the presentation of peptide epitopes by genetic fusion as well as the presentation of large antigens by bacterial superglue-based conjugation to the pre-assembled particle. Using the orthobunyavirus model Schmallenberg virus (SBV) we designed MPSPs presenting major immunogens of SBV and assessed their efficacy in a mouse model as well as in cattle, a target species of SBV. All prototype vaccines conferred protection from viral challenge infection and the multivalent presentation of the selected antigens on the MPSP markedly improved their immunogenicity compared to the monomeric subunits. Even a single shot vaccination protected about 80% of mice from an otherwise lethal dose of SBV. Most importantly, the MPSPs induced a virtually sterile immunity in cattle. Altogether, LS represents a promising platform for modular and rapid vaccine design.","Aebischer, Andrea Wernike Kerstin König Patricia Franzke Kati Wichgers Schreur Paul J.; Kortekaas, Jeroen Vitikainen Marika Wiebe Marilyn Saloheimo Markku Tchelet Ronen Jean-Christophe Audonnet Beer Martin",Vaccines,,52

In this study, the use of oral rinses (ORs) and posterior oropharyngeal saliva as an alternative to swab collection methods from symptomatic and asymptomatic health care workers for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR was evaluated. For saliva samples, the overall agreement with oropharyngeal swabs was 93% (Æ = 0.84), with a sensitivity of 96.7% (95% CI, 83.3%-99.8%). The agreement between saliva and nasopharyngeal swabs was 97.7% (Æ = 0.93), with a sensitivity of 94.1% (95% CI, 73.0%-99.7%). ORs were compared with nasopharyngeal swabs only, with an overall agreement of 85.7% (Æ = 0.65), and a sensitivity of 63% (95% CI, 46.6%-77.8%). The agreement between a laboratory-developed test based on the CDC RT-PCR and two commercial assays, the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 and the Cobas SARS-CoV-2, was also evaluated. The overall agreement was >90%. Finally, SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva samples was shown to be stable, with no changes in viral loads over 24 hours at both room temperature and 4°C. Although the dilution of SARS-CoV-2 in ORs precluded its acceptability as a sample type, posterior oropharyngeal saliva was an acceptable alternative sample type for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection.","Babady, N Esther; McMillen, Tracy; Jani, Krupa; Viale, Agnes; Robilotti, Elizabeth V; Aslam, Anoshe; Diver, Maureen; Sokoli, Desiree; Mason, Greg; Shah, Monika K; Korenstein, Deborah; Kamboj, Mini",J. mol. diagn,,52
256568,A note on double weak splittings of type II,2020,"All over the world pharmacists are standing up to the challenge of COVID- 19 and showing their commitment to the communities they serve. As the COVID-19 pandemic has tested global health systems to their limits, pharmacy professionals have shown themselves to be an integral part of them. Community pharmacists have supported government initiatives to control the pandemic and have ensured patients continued to receive their medicines. Hospital pharmacists have been moving beyond their specialties to help provide critical care to patients while dealing with ICU drug shortages. Pharmaceutical scientists have been involved in finding effective vaccines and identifying effective treatments. In short, the pharmacy profession has been demonstrating expertise, strength, courage and dedication to care at the highest level. The International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP), which represents the pharmacy profession globally, has a mission to advance pharmacy worldwide by sharing best pharmacy practice and innovation with the world. In this article, it describes how pharmacy has stepped up during the COVID­19 crisis by giving examples from several countries. It highlights, for example, how virtual practice became more prominent as face-to-face meetings became impossible, how pharmacists' scope of practice has been extended, and how pharmacy educators have embraced digital technologies to teach and assess students remotely. In particular, the article highlights pharmacists' involvement in the COVID-19 vaccination programmes in Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, the UK and the USA. As a result of all this, FIP sees an exciting future for the profession. Health ministers and heads of state have been praising pharmacists for their service, and FIP wants governments to translate this recognition into support for expanded roles and scientific research. It continues to gather data and intelligence to support an expansion of pharmacy practice, education and pharmaceutical workforce that builds on the profession's scientific base. All these advances are supported by scientific studies about our specialty. Finally, FIP expresses its worries about equity of access to medicines during the pandemic, as younger, healthier people in rich countries are vaccinated before people at greater risk in poor countries. It insists it will continue to advocate on this topic as a core component of its global vision. In this article, we share with readers a snapshot of how our profession around the world has adapted to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and our thoughts on the how it is affecting the evolution of pharmacy practice.","Jordan, Dominique; Guiu-Segura, Josep M; Sousa-Pinto, Gonçalo; Wang, Lin-Nam",Farm Hosp,,52

Outcomes of patients with COVID-19-related ARDS compared to ARDS unrelated to COVID-19 is not well characterized. AREAS COVERED: We performed a systematic review of PubMed, Scopus, and MedRxiv 11/1/2019 to 3/1/2021, including studies comparing outcomes in COVID-19-related ARDS (COVID-19 group) and ARDS unrelated to COVID-19 (ARDS group). Outcomes investigated were duration of mechanical ventilation-free days, intensive care unit (ICU) length-of-stay (LOS), hospital LOS, and mortality. Random effects models were fit for each outcome measure. Effect sizes were reported as pooled median differences of medians (MDMs), mean differences (MDs), or odds ratios (ORs). EXPERT OPINION: Ten studies with 2,281 patients met inclusion criteria (COVID-19: 861 [37.7%], ARDS: 1420 [62.3%]). There were no significant differences between the COVID-19 and ARDS groups for median number of mechanical ventilator-free days (MDM: -7.0 [95% CI: -14.8; 0.7], p = 0.075), ICU LOS (MD: 3.1 [95% CI: -5.9; 12.1], p = 0.501), hospital LOS (MD: 2.5 [95% CI: -5.6; 10.7], p = 0.542), or all-cause mortality (OR: 1.25 [95% CI: 0.78; 1.99], p = 0.361).

258248,Development of a capture sequencing assay for enhanced detection and genotyping of tick-borne pathogens,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the entire health care system, internationally as well as in Sweden. We aimed to study excess deaths (all death causes, but also COVID-19-related deaths) during the COVID-19 pandemic regarding age, socio-economic status, the situation in nursing homes, and place of death for nursing home residents. DESIGN: We performed a descriptive regional registry data study using VAL, the Stockholm Regional Council's central data warehouse, which covers almost all health care use in the county of Stockholm. T tests and chi-square tests were used for comparisons. RESULTS: Compared with 2016-2019, there were excess deaths in March-May 2020 (p < 0.0001), mainly explained by COVID-19, but in April there were also unexplained excess deaths. Individuals dying from COVID-19 were older than patients dying from other causes (p < 0.0001). There were more patient deaths among people residing in less advantaged socio-economic areas (p < 0.0001). Nursing home residents dying from COVID-19 were more often admitted to acute hospitals than residents dying from other causes (p < 0.0001). Also, the proportion of admissions of nursing home residents dying from other causes increased from April to May 2020 (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Dying from COVID-19 mainly affects the elderly, nursing home residents, and persons from less advantaged socio-economic groups. The pandemic has resulted in an increase in acute admissions of dying nursing home residents to acute hospitals.","Strang, Peter; Fürst, Per; Schultz, Torbjörn",Ups J Med Sci,,52
259990,Oxidative costs of cooperation in cooperatively breeding Damaraland mole-rats,2020,"(1) Background: The outbreak of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, forced colleges of pharmacy to implement new online learning methodologies to ensure that students could complete required courses. This transition was especially acute for laboratory simulation courses that require students to practice professional skills. This study aims to compare student assessment performance within a simulation-based laboratory course for students who completed the module prior to and after the online transition. (2) Methods: This study was a retrospective cohort comparison of student outcome performance with two distinct content delivery methods. Students were organized into two tracks at the beginning of the semester to determine the order of the simulation module. The online learning transition occurred in-between the delivery of the same module, which allowed comparison of online versus in-person content delivery with consistent assessment. Remediation rates on each assessment were compared using chi-squared tests. (3) Results: Student pharmacists across the first and second professional year performed similarly despite in-person or online course formats, with no significant differences in remediation rates. (4) Conclusions: Pharmacy course content, including laboratory-based simulation activity, may produce similar assessment performance when using online content delivery. Further research into hybrid or mixed-delivery models may enhance learning without affecting assessment performance.","Wilhite, Kristen; Jones, Mikael; Kebodeaux, Clark",,,52

This study aimed to examine psychosocial responses to COVID-19 using network analysis. A total of 1,500 urban residents of South Korea, selected from an online public panel, were surveyed using self-rating questionnaires addressing daily life changes, fear of infection, and distress related to COVID-19. Participants also completed a 10-item Perceived Stress Scale survey. We constructed regularized partial correlation networks, estimated global and local network metrics, tested network accuracy and stability, and compared the estimated networks between men and women. The network of the psychosocial responses consisted of 24 nodes that were classified into five groups: 'fear of infection', 'difficulty with outside activities', 'economic loss', 'altered eating and sleeping', and 'adaptive stress'. The node centralities indicated that 'distress in obtaining daily necessities' and 'concern about harming others' were the most important issues in people's responses to COVID-19. These nodes were connected by a negative edge, reflecting individual- and community-level issues, respectively. The overall level of perceived stress was linked to the network by the connection node 'anger toward others or society', which was associated with economic problems in men, but with distress from changes in daily activities in women. The results suggest that two contrasting feelings - personal insecurity regarding basic needs and a collectivistic orientation - play roles in the response to unusual experiences and distress due to COVID-19. This study also showed that public anger could arise from the psychological stress under the conditions imposed by COVID-19.","Ryu, SeungHyong Park InHoo Kim MiNa Lee YuRi Lee JongHun Kim H.; Jhon, Min Kim JuWan Lee JuYeon Kim JaeMin Kim SungWan",PLoS ONE,,52

The gray matter is composed of neuronal cell bodies, glial cells, dendrites, immune cells, and the vascular system, while the white matter is composed of concentrated myelinated axonal fibers extending from neuronal soma and glial cells, such as oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia. As neuronal cell bodies are located in the gray matter, great attention has been focused mainly on the gray matter regarding the understanding of the functions of the brain throughout the neurophysiological areas, leading to a scenario in which the function of the white matter is relatively underestimated or has not received much attention. However, increasing evidence shows that the white matter plays highly significant and pivotal functions in the brain based on the fact that its abnormalities are associated with numerous neurological diseases. In this review, we will broadly discuss the pathways and functions of myelination, which is one of the main processes that modulate the functions of the white matter, as well as the manner in which its abnormalities are related to neurological disorders.","Bae, Han-Gyu; Kim, Tai Kyoung; Suk, Ho Young; Jung, Sangyoung; Jo, Dong-Gyu",Arch Pharm Res,,52

Due to the diversity in clinical presentations of COVID-19, diagnosis by RT-PCR alone might miss patients with mild or no symptoms. Serology testing may better evaluate the actual magnitude of the spread of infection in the population. This is the first nationwide seroprevalence study conducted in Israel. It is one of the most widespread to be conducted thus far, and the largest per-country population size. The survey was conducted between June 28 and September 14, 2020 and included 54,357 patients who arrived at the Health Maintenance Organizations to undergo a blood test for any reason. A patient was considered seropositive after two consecutive positive results with two different kits (Abbott and DiaSorin).The overall seroprevalence was 3.8% (95%CI 3.7-4.0), males higher than females [4.9% (95%CI 4.6-5.2) vs. 3.1% (95%CI 2.9-3.3) respectively]. Adolescents had the highest prevalence [7.8% (95%CI 7.0-8.6)] compared to other age groups. Participants who had undergone RT-PCR testing had a tenfold higher risk to be seropositive. The prevalence-to-incidence ratio was 4.5-15.7. Serology testing is an important complimentary tool for assessing the actual magnitude of infection and thus essential for implementing policy measures to control the pandemic.

After adjustment for potential confounders, including epidemiological and clinical criteria, the chance of NPS access decreased by 29% (OR=0.71, 95%CI:0.63-0.79) in older vs. younger individuals. Such disparity was accentuated in areas with greater healthcare resources. In conclusion, in the first wave of the pandemic, age may have affected the access to COVID-19 diagnostic testing, disadvantaging older people.","Trevisan, Caterina Pedone Claudio Maggi Stefania Noale Marianna Bari Mauro Di Sojic Aleksandra Molinaro Sabrina Giacomelli Andrea Bianchi Fabrizio Tavio Marcello Rusconi Stefano Pagani Gabriele Galli Massimo Prinelli Federica Adorni Fulvio Incalzi Raffaele Antonelli Epicovid Working Group","Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",,52

In this unprecedented situation, the cross approach and interaction between the French pharmacovigilance network and French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) has been optimized to provide a real-time safety related to COVID-19 vaccines. Every week, pair of regional pharmacovigilance centers gathered safety data from the French pharmacovigilance network, to acutely expertise all the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported with each COVID-19 vaccine within a direct circuit with ANSM. Results of this expertise are presented and discussed with ANSM in order to raise safety signals and take appropriate measures if necessary. These reports are then published online. At the 25th of March 2021, more than 9 815 000 doses were injected and 20,265 ADRs were reported, mostly non-serious (76%). Several potential or confirmed signals were raised at the european level for those vaccines and others ADRs are under special attentions. This underlines the adaptiveness of the French pharmacovigilance system to both the identification of new patient profiles experiencing ADRs and the evolution of the vaccine strategy. Such an efficiency is necessary to manage a careful and acute surveillance of these new COVID-19 vaccines for and to face the pandemic at the same time.","Lacroix, Clémence; Salvo, Francesco; Gras-Champel, Valérie; Gautier, Sophie; Massy, Nathalie; Valnet-Rabier, Marie-Blanche; Grandvuillemin, Aurélie; Mounier, Céline; Benkebil, Mehdi; Pariente, Antoine; Jonville-Bera, Annie-Pierre; Micallef, Joëlle",Therapie,,52

The genome engineering of single-copy baculovirus infectious clones (bacmids) in E. coli has been valuable in the study of baculovirus biology, but bacmids are not yet widely applied as expression vectors. An important limitation of first-generation bacmids for large-scale protein production is the rapid loss of gene of interest (GOI) expression. The instability is caused by the mini-F replicon in the bacmid backbone, which is non-essential for baculovirus replication in insect cells, and carries the adjacent GOI in between attTn7 transposition sites. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that relocation of the attTn7 transgene insertion site away from the mini-F replicon prevents deletion of the GOI, thereby resulting in higher and prolonged recombinant protein expression levels. We applied lambda red genome engineering combined with SacB counterselection to generate a series of bacmids with relocated attTn7 sites and tested their performance by comparing the relative expression levels of different GOIs. We conclude that GOI expression from the odv-e56 (pif-5) locus results in higher overall expression levels and is more stable over serial passages compared to the original bacmid. Finally, we evaluated this improved next-generation bacmid during a bioreactor scale-up of Sf9 insect cells in suspension to produce enveloped chikungunya virus-like particles as a model vaccine.","Pijlman, Gorben P; Grose, Carissa; Hick, Tessy A H; Breukink, Herman E; van den Braak, Robin; Abbo, Sandra R; Geertsema, Corinne; van Oers, Monique M; Martens, Dirk E; Esposito, Dominic",Viruses,,52

Recent studies have shown that TMPRSS2 expressed on cell surface of host cells could play a crucial role in activation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein which facilitates the rapid early entry of the virus into host cells. In addition, direct suppression of TMPRSS2 using small drug inhibitors has been demonstrated to be effective in decreasing SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, which presents TMPRSS2 protease as a potential therapeutic strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to be capable of infecting gastrointestinal enterocytes and to provoke gastrointestinal disorders in patients with COVID-19 disease, which is considered as a new transmission route and target organ of SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we highlight the biochemical properties of TMPRSS2 protease and discuss the potential targeting of TMPRSS2 by inhibitors to prevent the SARS-CoV-2 spreading through gastro-intestinal tract system as well as the hurdles that need to be overcome.","Mahmoud, Ismail Sami; Jarrar, Yazun Bashir",Mol.

283008,Printed oxygen gas sensor using copper-DTDTPA solid electrolyte,2021,"Aluminium salts such as aluminium chlorohydrate (ACH) are the active ingredients of antiperspirant products. Their mechanism of action involves a temporary and superficial plugging of eccrine sweat pores at the skin surface. We developed a microfluidic system that allows the real time observation of the interactions between sweat and ACH in conditions mimicking physiological sweat flow and pore dimensions. Using artificial sweat containing bovine serum albumin as a model protein, we performed experiments under flowing conditions to demonstrate that pore clogging results from the aggregation of proteins by aluminium polycations at specific location in the sweat pore. Combining microfluidic experiments, confocal microscopy and numerical models helps to better understand the physical chemistry and mechanisms involved in pore plugging. The results show that plugging starts from the walls of sweat pores before expanding into the centre of the channel. The simulations aid in explaining the influence of ACH concentration as well as the impact of flow conditions on the localization of the plug. Altogether, these results outline the potential of both microfluidic confocal observations and numerical simulations at the single sweat pore level to understand why aluminium polycations are so efficient for sweat channel plugging.","Sakhawoth, Yasine; Dupire, Jules; Leonforte, Fabien; Chardon, Marion; Monti, Fabrice; Tabeling, Patrick; Cabane, Bernard; Botet, Robert; Galey, Jean-Baptiste",Sci Rep,,52

Debate remains, however, how can we best define changes in syringomyelia following surgery. OBJECTIVE: To introduce a grading system focusing on syrinx reduction based on routinely and reproducible radiological information, and provide a suggestion of the application of this scale for prediction of patient's prognoses. METHODS: Data from 48 patients with Chiari malformation and syringomyelia were compiled. We calculated syrinx cross-sectional area by approximating an ellipse in the largest axial plane. We compared the percentage of reduction or enlargement following surgery. The percentage change was grouped into four grades: Grade 0 = Increasing size, grade I &#8804; 50% reduction, grade II = 50% to 90% reduction, grade III &#8805; 90% reduction. RESULTS: A total of 89.6% of patients had syrinx improvement after surgery. A total of 5 patients were grade 0, 14 were grade I, 20 patients were grade II, and 9 patients met criteria for grade III. The mean postoperative syrinx area was 24.1 mm2 (0-169 mm2) with a mean syrinx reduction of 62.7%. CONCLUSION: Radiological improvement of syringomyelia can be mathematically defined and standardized to assist in communication in outcome-based trials.

This systematic review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of chronic feelings of emptiness in BPD, identify key findings, and clarify differences between chronic feelings of emptiness and related constructs like depression, hopelessness, and loneliness. METHOD: A PRISMA guided systematic search of the literature identified empirical studies with a focus on BPD or BPD symptoms that discussed chronic feelings of emptiness or a related construct. RESULTS: Ninety-nine studies met criteria for inclusion in the review. Key findings identified there were significant difficulties in defining and measuring chronic emptiness. However, based on the studies reviewed, chronic emptiness is a sense of disconnection from both self and others. When experienced at frequent and severe levels, it is associated with low remission for people with BPD. Emptiness as a construct can be separated from hopelessness, loneliness and intolerance of aloneness, however more research is needed to explicitly investigate these experiences. Chronic emptiness may be related to depressive experiences unique to people with BPD, and was associated with self-harm, suicidality, and lower social and vocational function. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: We conclude that understanding chronic feelings of emptiness is central to the experience of people with BPD and treatment focusing on connecting with self and others may help alleviate a sense of emptiness. Further research is required to provide a better understanding of the nature of chronic emptiness in BPD in order to develop ways to quantify the experience and target treatment.

Due to global limitations in testing capacity, effective prioritization of individuals for testing is essential. Methods: We devised a model estimating the probability of an individual to test positive for COVID-19 based on answers to 9 simple questions that have been associated with COVID-19 infection. Our model was devised from a subsample of a national symptom survey that was answered over 2 million times in Israel in its first 2 months and a targeted survey distributed to all residents of several cities in Israel. Overall, 43,752 adults were included, from which 498 self-reported as being COVID-19 positive. Findings: Our model was validated on a held-out set of individuals from Israel where it achieved an auROC of 0.737 (CI: 0.712-0.759), auPR of 0.144 (CI: 0.119-0.177) and demonstrated its applicability outside of Israel in an independently-collected symptom survey dataset from the U.S., U.K. and Sweden.Our analyses revealed interactions between several symptoms and age, suggesting variation in the clinical manifestation of the disease in different age groups. Conclusions: our tool can be used online and without exposure to suspected patients, thus suggesting worldwide utility in combating COVID-19 by better directing the limited testing resources through prioritization of individuals for testing, thereby increasing the rate at which positive individuals can be identified.

For providers, shifts in healthcare provision, communication formats, and support offerings for families facing distress or loss during the pandemic may promote providers' moral distress. This study aimed to define the ways that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted end-of-life care and approach to bereavement care in pediatric palliative care (PPC). METHOD: The Palliative Assessment of Needed DEvelopments and Modifications In the Era of Coronavirus (PANDEMIC) survey was developed to learn about the PPC experience during COVID-19 in the United States. The survey was posted with permission on seven nationally focused Listservs. RESULTS: A total of 207 PPC team members from 80 cities within 39 states and the District of Columbia participated. In the majority of hospitals, admitted pediatric patients were only allowed one parent as a visitor with the exception of both parents or nuclear family at end of life. Creative alternatives to grief support and traditional funeral services were described. The high incidence of respondents' depicted moral distress was often focused on an inability to provide a desired level of care due to existing rules and policies and bearing witness to patient and family suffering enhanced by the pandemic. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the provision of end-of-life care and bereavement for children, family caregivers, and PPC providers. Our results identify tangible limitations of restricted personal contact and the pain of watching families stumble through a stunted grieving process.

A large part of this variation may be due to the ages of individuals who are tested and identified. OBJECTIVE: To measure the contribution of distortions from the age distributions of confirmed cases to CFRs within and across populations. DESIGN: Cross-sectional demographic study using aggregate data on COVID-19 cases and deaths by age. SETTING: Population-based data from China, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States. PARTICIPANTS: All individuals with confirmed COVID-19, as reported by each country as of 19 April 2020 (N = 1 223 261). MEASUREMENTS: Age-specific COVID-19 CFRs and age-specific population shares by country. RESULTS: The overall observed CFR varies widely, with the highest rates in Italy (9.3%) and the Netherlands (7.4%) and the lowest rates in South Korea (1.6%) and Germany (0.7%). Adjustment for the age distribution of cases explains 66% of the variation of across countries, with a resulting age-standardized median CFR of 1.9%. Among a larger sample of 95 countries, the observed variation in COVID-19 CFRs is 13 times larger than what would be expected on the basis of just differences in the age-composition of countries. LIMITATION: The age-adjusted rates assume that, conditional on age, COVID-19 mortality among diagnosed cases is the same as that among undiagnosed cases and that individuals of all ages are equally susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. CONCLUSION: Selective testing and identifying of older cases considerably warps estimates of the lethality of COVID-19 within populations and comparisons across countries. Removing age distortions and focusing on differences in age-adjusted case fatality will be essential for accurately comparing countries' performance in caring for patients with COVID-19 and for monitoring the epidemic over time.

289916,Virome of Bat Guano from Nine Northern California Roosts,2021,"Textbook wisdom advocates for smooth function fits and implies that interpolation of noisy data should lead to poor generalization. A related heuristic is that fitting parameters should be fewer than measurements (Occam's Razor). Surprisingly, contemporary machine learning (ML) approaches, cf. deep nets (DNNs), generalize well despite interpolating noisy data. This may be understood via Statistically Consistent Interpolation (SCI), i.e. data interpolation techniques that generalize optimally for big data. In this article we elucidate SCI using the weighted interpolating nearest neighbors (wiNN) algorithm, which adds singular weight functions to kNN (k-nearest neighbors). This shows that data interpolation can be a valid ML strategy for big data. SCI clarifies the relation between two ways of modeling natural phenomena: the rationalist approach (strong priors) of theoretical physics with few parameters and the empiricist (weak priors) approach of modern ML with more parameters than data. SCI shows that the purely empirical approach can successfully predict. However data interpolation does not provide theoretical insights, and the training data requirements may be prohibitive. Complex animal brains are between these extremes, with many parameters, but modest training data, and with prior structure encoded in species-specific mesoscale circuitry. Thus, modern ML provides a distinct epistemological approach different both from physical theories and animal brains.","Mitra, Partha P",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.00526v1.pdf,52

292812,Go viral or go broadcast? Characterizing the virality and growth of cascades,2020-06-01,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Data on the relation of egg consumption with risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and coronary heart disease (CHD) are limited and inconsistent. Few studies have controlled for overall dietary patterns in egg-T2D or egg-CHD analyses, and it is unclear whether any observed elevated risks of T2D and CHD with frequent egg consumption is real or due to confounding by dietary habits. We tested the hypothesis that frequent egg consumption is associated with a higher risk of T2D and CHD risk after adjustment for overall dietary patterns among adults. DESIGN: We used prospective cohort design to complete time-to-event analyses. METHODS: We pooled de novo, harmonized, individual-level analyses from nine US cohorts (n = 103,811). Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios separately in each cohort adjusting for age, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), exercise, smoking, alcohol intake, and dietary patterns. We pooled cohort-specific results using an inverse-variance weighted method to estimate summary relative risks. RESULTS: Median age ranged from 25 to 72 years. Median egg consumption was 1 egg per week in most of the cohorts. While egg consumption up to one per week was not associated with T2D risk, consumption of &#8805;2 eggs per week was associated with elevated risk [27% elevated risk of T2D comparing 7+ eggs/week with none (95% CI: 16%-37%)]. There was little evidence for heterogeneity across cohorts and we observed similar conclusions when stratified by BMI. Overall, egg consumption was not associated with the risk of CHD. However, in a sensitivity analysis, there was a 30% higher risk of CHD (95% CI: 3%-56%) restricted to older adults consuming 5-6 eggs/week. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed an elevated risk of T2D with egg consumption of &#8805;2 eggs per week but not with <2 eggs/week. While there was no overall association of egg consumption with CHD risk, the elevated CHD observed with consumption of 5-6 eggs/week in older cohorts merits further investigation.","Djoussé, Luc; Zhou, Guohai; McClelland, Robyn L; Ma, Nanxun; Zhou, Xia; Kabagambe, Edmond K; Talegawkar, Sameera A; Judd, Suzanne E; Biggs, Mary L; Fitzpatrick, Annette L; Clark, Cheryl R; Gagnon, David R; Steffen, Lyn M; Gaziano, J Michael; Lee, I-Min; Buring, Julie E; Manson, JoAnn E",Clin Nutr,,52
293281,Carbon-based nanomaterials for viral infection management,2021,"This study presents a new approach to determine the likelihood of asymptomatic carriers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by using interaction-based continuous learning and inference of individual probability (CLIIP) for contagious ranking. This approach is developed based on an individual directed graph (IDG), using multi-layer bidirectional path tracking and inference searching. The IDG is determined by the appearance timeline and spatial data that can adapt over time. Additionally, the approach takes into consideration the incubation period and several features that can represent real-world circumstances, such as the number of asymptomatic carriers present. After each update of confirmed cases, the model collects the interaction features and infers the individual person's probability of getting infected using the status of the surrounding people. The CLIIP approach is validated using the individualized bidirectional SEIR model to simulate the contagion process. Compared to traditional contact tracing methods, our approach significantly reduces the screening and quarantine required to search for the potential asymptomatic virus carriers by as much as 94%.","Liu, Shangching; Liu, Koyun; Chiang, Hwaihai; Zhang, Jianwei; Chang, Tsungyao",Sci Rep,,52

It is set against a backdrop of a workforce recruitment and retention crisis predicted to worsen in coming years. There is a need to do things differently in healthcare, including better diversity and distribution of leadership. We make the case for senior non-consultant doctors, in the UK more usually referred to as specialty and associate specialist or locally employed doctors. These skilled, experienced medics have much to offer yet are frequently overlooked, with little guidance or support from central organisations and medical colleges or within NHS Trusts themselves. In this commentary, we suggest ways this workforce might be better tapped into, to the benefit of patients and healthcare systems, as well as the doctors themselves. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

295811,Transcriptional Decoding of Morphogen Gradients during Development,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in more than two million deaths at 2021 February . There is currently no approved therapeutics for treating COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is considered a key therapeutic target by many researchers. Here we describe the identification of several monoclonal antibodies that target SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. One human antibody, CA521FALA, demonstrated neutralization potential by immunizing human antibody transgenic mice. CA521FALA showed potent SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. CA521FALA also demonstrated having a long half-life of 9.5 days in mice and 9.3 days in rhesus monkeys. CA521FALA inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in SARS-CoV-2 susceptible mice at a therapeutic setting with virus titer of the lung reduced by 4.5 logs. Structural analysis by cryo-EM revealed that CA521FALA recognizes an epitope overlapping with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-binding sites in SARS-CoV-2 RBD in the Spike protein. CA521FALA blocks the interaction by binding all three RBDs of one SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer simultaneously. These results demonstrate the importance for antibody-based therapeutic interventions against COVID-19 and identifies CA521FALA a promising antibody that reacts with SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein to strongly neutralize its activity.","Song, Deyong; Wang, Wenbo; Dong, Chuangchuang; Ning, Zhenfei; Liu, Xiu; Liu, Chuan; Du, Guangying; Sha, Chunjie; Wang, Kailin; Lu, Jun; Sun, Baiping; Zhao, Yanyan; Wang, Qiaoping; Xu, Hongguang; Li, Ying; Shen, Zhenduo; Jiao, Jie; Wang, Ruiying; Tian, Jingwei; Liu, Wanhui; Wang, Lan; Deng, Yong-Qiang; Dou, Changlin",Commun Biol,,52

Brown exert anti-inflammatory activities and relieve oxidative stress via Nrf2 activation,2020,"In the throes of the current COVID-19 pandemic, interest has burgeoned in the cardiovascular complications of this virulent viral infection. As troponin, a biomarker of cardiac injury, often rises in hospitalized patients, its interpretation and actionability require careful consideration. Fulminant myocarditis due to direct viral infection can certainly occur, but patients with increased oxygen demands due to tachycardia and fever, and reduced oxygen delivery due to hypotension and hypoxemia can cause myocardial injury indirectly. Cytokines released during the acute infection can elicit activation of cells within pre-existing atherosclerotic lesions, augmenting thrombotic risk and risk of ischemic syndromes. Moreover, microvascular activation by cytokines can cause not only myocardial injury but harm other organ systems commonly involved in COVID-19 infections including the kidneys. Dealing with the immense challenge of COVID-19 disease, confronted with severely ill patients in dire straits with virtually no rigorous evidence base to guide our therapy, we must call upon our clinical skills and judgment. These touchstones can help guide us in selecting patients who might benefit from the advanced imaging and invasive procedures that present enormous logistical challenges in the current context. Lacking a robust evidence base, pathophysiologic reasoning can help guide our choices of therapy for individual clinical scenarios. We must exercise caution and extreme humility, as often plausible interventions fail when tested rigorously. But act today we must, and understanding the multiplicity of mechanisms of myocardial injury in COVID-19 infection will help us meet our mission unsupported by the comfort of strong data.","Libby, Peter",,,52
296086,Ca2+ handling at the mitochondria-ER contact sites in neurodegeneration,2021,"A major challenge for health services worldwide is in providing adequate medical care during mass disasters. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic highlights this difficulty. Patient surge, a consequence of most types of disasters that contribute to trauma experiences, is a primary factor in disrupting such care as it is composed of worried well persons and those experiencing psychosocial trauma that can severely disrupt and overwhelm effective acute hospital based health care. We review the literature and propose a potential solution framework to reduce such a surge that relies on exploiting community social networks as first responders. We utilize and integrate literature based evidence on patient surge, community disaster behaviors and community based informal social networks to examine reasons for patient surge to hospitals. We then propose that leveraging community based social networks as a potent deterrent for non-critically injured, especially those who have experienced psychosocial trauma or the worried well, from seeking hospital care during ongoing disasters. By emphasizing the social capital inherent in community based social networks, this perspective posits an alternative cost-effective means of reducing patient surge.","Kirschenbaum, Alan",Nat Hazards (Dordr),,52

Few studies have examined perceived impacts of SIV introduction beyond disease reduction on health systems; understanding such impacts will be particularly salient in the context of COVID-19 vaccine introduction. We collected qualitative data from key informants-Partnership for Influenza Vaccine Introduction (PIVI) contacts in six middle-income PIVI vaccine recipient countries-to understand perceptions of ancillary benefits and challenges from SIV implementation. Respondents reported benefits associated with SIV introduction, including improved attitudes to SIV among risk groups (characterized by increased demand) and perceptions that SIV introduction improved relationships with other ministries and collaboration with mass media. Challenges included sustaining investment in SIV programs, as vaccine supply did not always meet coverage goals, and managing SIV campaigns.","Ebama, Malembe S; Chu, Susan Y; Azziz-Baumgartner, Eduardo; Lafond, Kathryn E; McCarron, Margaret; Hadler, Stephen C; Porter, Rachael M; McKinlay, Mark; Bresee, Joseph",Vaccine,,52

By combining information from various sources, we have explored different responses according to two dimensions: changes in policy and protocols, and reported difficulties in access. Our analysis shows significant differences across the observed regions and salient debates around abortion. While some countries made efforts to maintain and facilitate abortion care during the pandemic through the introduction or expansion of use of telemedicine and early medical abortion, others attempted to restrict it further. The situation was also diverse in the countries where governments did not change policies or protocols.

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among demographics, COVID-19 life impacts, and depression and anxiety in adults aged 60 and older from 33 countries. A sample of 823 older adults aged 60-94 and residing in 33 countries completed a 10-min online survey following recruitment from mailing lists and social media. Being separated from and having conflicts with loved ones predicted both anxiety and depression, as did residing in a country with higher income. Getting medical treatment for severe symptoms of COVID-19 and having decreased work responsibilities predicted depression, but adjustment to working from home and younger age predicted both depression and anxiety. Participants from Europe and Central Asia reported higher depression than those from all other regions and higher anxiety than those from Latin America and the Caribbean.

318008,Root responses of contrasting rice genotypes to low temperature stress,2020,"To investigate the knowledge, preventive practices, and depression of Chinese university students living in South Korea and Mainland China during the COVID-19 outbreak and explore the determinants of depression among these students, an online cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted from 23 March to 12 April 2020. The online questionnaire included questions on knowledge and preventive practices related to COVID-19, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 was used to diagnose depressive symptoms. A total of 420 Chinese university students were finally included in the study (171 students from South Korea and 249 students from Mainland China). The majority of these students had a good level of knowledge of COVID-19. Students living in South Korea displayed better preventive practices than those living in Mainland China;however, the proportion of students (28.7%) with moderate-to-severe depression in this group was relatively higher than that (18.9%) of the Mainland Group (chi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 5.50, p &lt; 0.05). More severe depression was related to high levels of concern about family members and contracting COVID-19 as well as suspecting themselves of having come into contact with patients. Displaying more preventive behaviors decreased the depressive symptoms in both groups. These data could be used as a reference for further studies in different regions to take measures (e.g., psychological counseling and encouragement for physical activities) to reduce depressive symptoms in university students.","Zhao, B.; Kong, F.; Nam, E.

318490,Corrigendum: COVIEdb: A Database for Potential Immune Epitopes of Coronaviruses,2020,"During its 70‐year existence, China's modern banking system has typically been ill used by its government Nevertheless, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Chinese government made effective use of ten years and a lot of capital to restructure its banks And on the eve of the global financial crisis in 2008, China's principal banks had cleaned up their bad loans and received or raised large amounts of equity, in part by listing their shares internationally In so doing, such banks may well have positioned themselves to face the crisis with the strongest balance sheets in the world But since then, in the wake of the global financial crisis, China's banks have used securitization models—originating for the most part in the U S —to create products similar to the mortgage‐backed securities that nearly brought down the global banking system The collapse of such securities in 2008 compelled China to undertake a massive stimulus program driven by bank lending This stimulus has lasted nearly a decade, with a second recent and massive injection prompted by the COVID‐19 pandemic The net effect of such stimulus is that China's total bank assets are now over 3 5 times national GDP—as compared to 1 0 in the U S —and more than twice the total level of U S banking assets in an economy just two‐thirds the size But even with such an increase, reported non‐performing assets have remained at remarkably low levels—though the report itself has been received with near universal skepticism Fueling this skepticism, the scale and balance sheet quality of these banks do not compute when one takes a closer look at the banks' main borrowers: largely local government entities with limited revenue bases In China, local governments do not enjoy taxing authority and their budgets consistently exceed their revenue, with the funding gaps filled by ever more bank loans As a consequence, most local governments are effectively bankrupt How, then, given the financial condition of their borrowers, do Chinese banks continue to report superlative earnings and clean balance sheets? The author discusses in detail the two main methods banks have used to meet their accounting requirements while obscuring asset quality: (1) converting bank loans into bonds issued by the same borrowers;and (2) the creation of massive amounts of wealth management products (or WMPs), which are retail deposits backed not just by Treasuries and other liquid securities (as in the U S ), but in significant part by illiquid assets that create troublingly large maturity mismatches After pointing out the similarity of such WMPs to the mortgage‐backed securities used by American banks a decade ago, the author emphasizes the irony that, having used American banks as models for restructuring, China's government has forced its banks to continue to follow in their path to what at some point is highly likely to be a painful reckoning","Walter, Carl",Journal of Applied Corporate Finance,,52
318633,Traditional foods with their constituent's antiviral and immune system modulating properties,2021,"Background and aims: With the onset of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, healthcare providers abruptly changed their delivery of care to protect patients and staff from infection. One such change was to convert in-person advanced gastrointestinal endoscopy pre-procedure consultations to telemedicine visits. The use of telemedicine has been successfully used in the field of gastroenterology in managing symptoms and chronic conditions among established patients. However, to our knowledge, there is little literature on the utility of this modality for pre-procedure consultation visits, where patients often meet their proceduralists for the first time. The aim of this study was to compare overall patient satisfaction among those who had pre-procedure consultation visits by telemedicine, in –person, or a direct access procedure (instructions and procedure explained by a nurse practitioner or physicians assistant). Methods: Patients who had undergone an advanced endoscopic procedure at Long Island Jewish Hospital from the months of May 2020 to August 2020 were called by telephone and asked to complete a modified version of the validated patient satisfaction survey mGHAA-9. The survey was designed to assess patient satisfaction in their pre-procedure, intra-procedure, and post procedure experiences. Patients were grouped based on whether they had received an in-clinic consultation visit by the endoscopist, telemedicine consultation visit by the endoscopist, or direct access. Geographic location to the office, prior endoscopic experience, type of endoscopic procedure (diagnostic vs. therapeutic), and new gastrointestinal cancer diagnosis data were recorded. Results: Of the total 322 patients that were called, 123 agreed to participate (38%) and provided responses to the survey. There were 26 who had in person consultation visits, 32 who had telemedicine consultation visits, and 65 direct access visits. Overall mean satisfaction among the three groups did not reveal a statistically significant difference (p value= 0.983). Furthermore, sub-analysis of the preprocedure, intra procedure, and post procedure satisfaction scores did not reveal statistically significant differences (p=0.996, p=0.244, and p=0.998, respectively). However, patients with a new gastrointestinal cancer diagnosis had a statistically significant higher mean satisfaction score in those who had telemedicine visits with proceduralists compared to those who had direct access procedures (P=0.0116). Conclusion: Our study suggests that pre-procedure consultation visits by telemedicine, in-person, or direct access all have similar satisfaction scores among patients. However, telemedicine consultation visits with the endoscopist may be preferred over direct access in patients who have a clinically high suspicion for a new gastrointestinal cancer diagnosis.

318920,The theoretical investigation of OH-induced degradation mechanisms of isoproturon,2020,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 predisposes patients to secondary infections; however, a better understanding of the impact of coinfections on the outcome of hospitalized COVID-19 patients is still necessary. AIM: To analyse death risk due to coinfections in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The odds of death of 212 severely ill COVID-19 patients were evaluated, with detailed focus on the risks for each pathogen, site of infection, comorbidities and length of hospitalization. FINDINGS: The mortality rate was 50.47%. Fungal and/or bacterial isolation occurred in 89 patients, of whom 83.14% died. Coinfected patients stayed hospitalized longer and had an increased odds of dying (odds ratio (OR): 13.45; R2 = 0.31). The risk of death was increased by bacterial (OR: 11.28) and fungal (OR: 5.97) coinfections, with increased levels of creatinine, leucocytes, urea and C-reactive protein. Coinfections increased the risk of death if patients suffered from cardiovascular disease (OR: 11.53), diabetes (OR: 6.00) or obesity (OR: 5.60) in comparison with patients with these comorbidities but without pathogen isolation. The increased risk of death was detected for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (OR: 25.39), Candida non-albicans (OR: 11.12), S. aureus (OR: 10.72), Acinetobacter spp. (OR: 6.88), Pseudomonas spp. (OR: 4.77), and C. albicans (OR: 3.97). The high-risk sites of infection were blood, tracheal aspirate, and urine. Patients with coinfection undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation were 3.8 times more likely to die than those without positive cultures. CONCLUSION: Severe COVID-19 patients with secondary coinfections required longer hospitalization and had higher risk of death. The early diagnosis of coinfections is essential to identify high-risk patients and to determine the right interventions to reduce mortality.","Silva, D L; Lima, C M; Magalhães, V C R; Baltazar, L M; Peres, N T A; Caligiorne, R B; Moura, A S; Fereguetti, T; Martins, J C; Rabelo, L F; Abrahão, J S; Lyon, A C; Johann, S; Santos, D A",J Hosp Infect,,52
319076,What makes (hydroxy)chloroquine ineffective against COVID-19: insights from cell biology,2021,"High-quality biosecurity practices are critical to restarting international tourism. Effective market segmentation improves the communication and efficacy of health advice. Travel frequency is an important basis for health-related consumer segmentation, as it is closely related to risk of greater exposure to infectious diseases. Theoretically grounded studies of tourist biosecurity behavior and travel frequency have largely been neglected, although insights into practices and attitudes are especially relevant for coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19 (coronavirus disease of 2019) health responses. Therefore, this research constructed and tested a conceptual model applying Value-Attitude-Behavior theory to US travelers to see whether the frequency of international travel affected tourist COVID-19 related biosecurity behavior. US respondents were drawn from a panel using a quota sampling technique according to the age and gender of American outbound tourists. An online survey was administered in September 2020. The responses (n = 395) of those who traveled internationally within five years were analyzed utilizing partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) with multi-group analysis. Travel frequency significantly affects biosecurity behavior. High travel frequency (&#8805;8 trips) has the strongest effect of value on biosecurity attitudes, personal norms, social norms, and biosecurity social norms, leading to biosecurity behaviors. Biosecurity behaviors pertaining to medium travel frequency (4-7 trips) are significantly influenced by personal norms. At low travel frequency (1-3 trips) levels, biosecurity behaviors are stimulated by biosecurity attitudes and social norms, showing the highest predictive power among the three groups. This work provides insights into international travel consumer biosecurity practices and behavior. From a market segmentation perspective, the levels of international travel frequency have various influences on biosecurity values, attitudes, personal norms, social norms, and behaviors. The biosecurity behaviors of low-frequency travelers are found to be the most significant of the three groups, suggesting that individuals who travel less frequently are more likely to practice responsible COVID-19 biosecurity behavior.","Kim, Myung Ja; Hall, C Michael; Bonn, Mark",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,52

321722,Oncolytic Viruses and Their Potential as a Therapeutic Opportunity in Osteosarcoma,2020,"High-throughput detection strategies for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in patients recovering from COVID-19, or in vaccinated individuals, are urgently required during this ongoing pandemic. Serological assays are the most widely used method to measure antibody responses in patients. However, most of the current methods lack the speed, stability, sensitivity, and specificity to be selected as a test for worldwide serosurveys. Here, we demonstrate a novel NanoBiT-based serological assay for fast and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibodies in sera of COVID-19 patients. This assay can be done in high-throughput manner at 384 samples per hour and only requires a minimum of 5 µL of serum or 10 ng of antibody. The stability of our NanoBiT reporter in various temperatures (4-42 °C) and pH (4-12) settings suggests the assay will be able to withstand imperfect shipping and handling conditions for worldwide seroepidemiologic surveillance in the post-vaccination period of the pandemic. Our newly developed rapid assay is highly accessible and may facilitate a more cost-effective solution for seroconversion screening as vaccination efforts progress.","Azad, Taha; Rezaei, Reza; Singaravelu, Ragunath; Jamieson, Taylor R; Crupi, Mathieu J F; Surendran, Abera; Poutou, Joanna; Taklifi, Parisa; Cowan, Juthaporn; Cameron, Donald William; Ilkow, Carolina S",,,52

322886,"Chemical kinetics of the development of coronaviral infection in the human body: Critical conditions, toxicity mechanisms, ""thermoheliox"", and ""thermovaccination""",2020,"There has been considerable public debate about whether the economic impact of the current COVID19 restrictions are worth the costs. Although the potential impact of COVID19 has been modelled extensively, very few numbers have been presented in the discussions about potential economic impacts. For a good answer to the question - will the restrictions cause as much harm as COVID19? - credible evidence-based estimates are required, rather than simply rhetoric. Here we provide some preliminary estimates to compare the impact of the current restrictions against the direct impact of the virus. Since most countries are currently taking an approach that reduces the number of COVID19 deaths, the estimates we provide for deaths from COVID19 are deliberately taken from the low end of the estimates of the infection fatality rate, while estimates for deaths from an economic recession are deliberately computed from double the high end of confidence interval for severe economic recessions. This ensures that an adequate challenge to the status quo of the current restrictions is provided. Our analysis shows that strict restrictions to eradicate the virus are likely to lead to at least eight times fewer total deaths than an immediate return to work scenario.","Bailey, Neil W; West, Daniel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.03491v1.pdf,52
322968,Phage capsid nanoparticles as multivalent inhibitors of viral infections,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To survey a group of global pediatric otolaryngology specialists to assess their usage and access to personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A survey of 13 questions was created collecting information on: basic demographics of practice, types of PPE used for procedures of varying aerosolization risk, access to positive air-purifying respirator (PAPR) and patient testing for SARS-CoV-2. Pediatric otolaryngologists were invited to complete the survey via Whatsapp&#8482;. RESULTS: 96 responses were collected from 17 different countries. N95 was the most commonly utilized PPE when dealing with COVID-19 patients (64.2%-81.9% depending on aerosolization risk of the procedure). Significantly higher use of PAPR was noted in high-risk aerosolization generating medical procedures, when compared to other risks. Face covering was used consistently (91.6%). Most respondents (78.1%, n = 75) had access to PAPR or had at least requested it. The majority of patients (56.2%, n = 54) was being tested for SARS-CoV-2 prior to procedures performed in operating rooms (OR); whereas, only 1.1% (n = 1) of clinic patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 irrespective of the history or symptomatology. CONCLUSIONS: Most pediatric otolaryngologists used N95 and some form of face covering (eg. goggles, face shields) when dealing with patients with COVID-19 positive status. PAPR was used in situations of high aerosolization risk. Majority of respondents were screening all patients prior to procedures in the operating room.","Kim, Dong Hyun; Chadha, Neil K; Nguyen, Lily Hp; Husein, Murad",Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,,52

325801,Xenogenization of tumor cells by fusogenic exosomes in tumor microenvironment ignites and propagates antitumor immunity,2020,"BACKGROUND: As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, most centers performing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (allo-HCT) have switched to the use of cryopreserved grafts. Previous investigators have suggested that cryopreserved allografts may heighten risk of nonengraftment. To date, no study has investigated the effect of cryopreservation of CD34-selected hematopoietic progenitor cells (CD34+HPC) used as the sole graft source. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate outcomes after unrelated donor or matched sibling allo-HCT with cryopreserved CD34+HPC. STUDY DESIGN: This was a single center analysis of adult patients with hematologic malignancies who underwent allo-HCT with cryopreserved CD34 selected allo-HCT grafts from 1/2010 to 6/2017. All patients received ablative conditioning and antirejection prophylaxis with rabbit ATG. GCSF-mobilized leukapheresis products underwent CD34 selection using the CliniMACS Reagent System. Cells were then cryopreserved in DMSO (final concentration 7.5%) to -90°C using a controlled rate freezing system before transfer to vapor phase liquid nitrogen storage. In internal validation, this method has shown 92% mean CD34+ viability and 99.7% mean CD34+ recovery. Engraftment was defined as the first of 3 consecutive days of ANC &#8805; 0.5. Platelet recovery was recorded as the first of 7 consecutive days with platelet count &#8805; 20 K/mcL without transfusion. Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to estimate OS/RFS, and cumulative incidence functions were used to estimate relapse, NRM, and acute GvHD. RESULTS: A total of 64 patients received a cryopreserved CD34 selected graft. Median CD34+ cell count before cryopreservation was 6.6â¯×â¯10^6/kg (range 1.4-16.1) and median CD3+ count 2.0â¯×â¯10^3/kg (range 0-21.1). All patients were engrafted, at a median of 11 days post-HCT (range 8-14). One patient had poor graft function in the setting of CMV viremia, requiring CD34 selected boost on day 57. Median time to platelet recovery was 16 days (range 13-99). Comparing cryopreserved versus fresh grafts, estimated 2-year OS was 70% (58-83%, 95% CI) vs 62% (57-67%, 95% CI) with fresh grafts (HR 0.86, 0.54-1.35 95% CI, pâ¯=â¯0.5). The estimated 2-year RFS was 59% (48-74%, 95% CI) versus 56% (51-61%, 95% CI; HR 1.01, 0.68-1.51 95% CI, p > 0.9). Cumulative incidence of relapse at 2 years was 29% (17-41%, 95% CI) versus 23% (19-27%, 95% CI; pâ¯=â¯0.16), while cumulative incidence of NRM at 2 years was 17% (9-28%, 95% CI) versus 23% (19-28%, 95% CI; pâ¯=â¯0.24). Grade II-IV acute GvHD by day 100 cumulative incidence was 16% in cryopreserved (8-26%, 95% CI), and 16% (13-20%, 95% CI; pâ¯=â¯0.97) after fresh graft infusion. Moderate to severe chronic GvHD by day 365 occurred in only one recipient of a cryopreserved graft (2%). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with hematologic malignancies who received cryopreserved allogeneic CD34+HPC, engraftment, GvHD, and survival outcomes were consistent with that seen in fresh allogeneic CD34+HPC grafts at our center. Our laboratory validation and clinical experience demonstrate the safety of our cryopreservation procedure for CD34 selected allografts.","Jacob, Reuben P; Flynn, Jessica; Devlin, Sean M; Maloy, Molly; Giralt, Sergio A; Maslak, Peter; O039,; Reilly, Richard J; Tonon, Jo-Ann; Perales, Miguel Angel; Avecilla, Scott T; Cho, Christina",,,52

327810,The Fas/FasL Signaling Pathway: Its Role in the Metastatic Process and as a Target for Treating Osteosarcoma Lung Metastases,2020,"Subjective belief elicitation about uncertain events has a long lineage in the economics and statistics literatures. Recent developments in the experimental elicitation and statistical estimation of subjective belief distributions allow inferences about whether these beliefs are biased relative to expert opinion, and the confidence with which they are held. Beliefs about COVID-19 prevalence and mortality interact with risk management efforts, so it is important to understand relationships between these beliefs and publicly disseminated statistics, particularly those based on evolving epidemiological models. The pandemic provides a unique setting over which to bracket the range of possible COVID-19 prevalence and mortality outcomes given the proliferation of estimates from epidemiological models. We rely on the epidemiological model produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation together with the set of epidemiological models summarised by FiveThirtyEight to bound prevalence and mortality outcomes for one-month, and December 1, 2020 time horizons. We develop a new method to partition these bounds into intervals, and ask subjects to place bets on these intervals, thereby revealing their beliefs. The intervals are constructed such that if beliefs are consistent with epidemiological models, subjects are best off betting the same amount on every interval. We use an incentivised experiment to elicit beliefs about COVID-19 prevalence and mortality from 598 students at Georgia State University, using six temporally-spaced waves between May and November 2020. We find that beliefs differ markedly from epidemiological models, which has implications for public health communication about the risks posed by the virus.","Harrison, Glenn W; Hofmeyr, Andre; Kincaid, Harold; Monroe, Brian; Ross, Don; Schneider, Mark; Swarthout, J Todd",Methods (S.

Conclusions During pandemic Covid-19 the access to health services was limited and poor. Limited access to health services and the fear of Covid-19 infection can explain the lower number of elective surgical procedures for cancer in 2020 compared to the same period in the 2019.","Giuffrida, Mario; Cozzani, Federico; Rossini, Matteo; Bonati, Elena; Del Rio, Paolo",Acta Biomed,,52

329960,DNA methylation architecture of the ACE2 gene in nasal cells of children,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Community face mask use during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has considerably differed worldwide. Generally, Asians are more inclined to wear face masks during disease outbreaks. Hong Kong has emerged relatively unscathed during the initial outbreak of COVID-19, despite its dense population. Previous infectious disease outbreaks influenced the local masking behaviour and response to public health measures. Thus, local behavioural insights are important for the successful implementation of infection control measures. This study explored the behaviour and attitudes of wearing face masks in the community during the initial spread of COVID-19 in Hong Kong. METHODS: We observed the masking behaviour of 10 211 pedestrians in several regions across Hong Kong from 1 to 29 February 2020. We supplemented the data with an online survey of 3199 respondents' views on face mask use. RESULTS: Among pedestrians, the masking rate was 94.8%; 83.7% wore disposable surgical masks. However, 13.0% wore surgical masks incorrectly with 42.5% worn too low, exposing the nostrils or mouth; 35.5% worn 'inside-out' or 'upside-down'. Most online respondents believed in the efficacy of wearing face mask for protection (94.6%) and prevention of community spread (96.6%). Surprisingly, 78.9% reused their mask; more respondents obtained information from social media (65.9%) than from government websites (23.2%). CONCLUSIONS: In Hong Kong, members of the population are motivated to wear masks and believe in the effectiveness of face masks against disease spread. However, a high mask reuse rate and errors in masking techniques were observed. Information on government websites should be enhanced and their accessibility should be improved.","Tam, V C W; Tam, S Y; Khaw, M L; Law, H K W; Chan, C P L; Lee, S W Y",Hong Kong Med J,,52

336473,Nanotoxicology and nanomedicine: The Yin and Yang of nano-bio interactions for the new decade,2021,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to estimate the incidence and mortality rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Brazilian children and to analyze its relationship with socio-economic inequalities in a state-level analysis. STUDY DESIGN: This is a nationwide register-based study. METHODS: To estimate the incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 in Brazilian children aged 0-19 years, we extracted data of confirmed cases and deaths from the de-identified microdata catalog and official bulletins of the 27 Brazilian states' health department websites until September 3, 2020. Social and economic inequalities were evaluated using the Social Vulnerability Index and Gini coefficient, respectively. The relationship between COVID-19 rates in Brazilian children and socio-economic vulnerability at the state level was analyzed using Spearman's rank correlation. RESULTS: Of the 3,998,055 individuals with COVID-19 included in our database, 335,279 (8.4%) were children aged 0-19 years. Eight hundred deaths in children were registered, which accounts for about 0.7% of the deaths related to COVID-19 in the country. There were important differences in the incidence and mortality rates among Brazilian regions, and a correlation between mortality rates and social (&#961; = 0.519; P-value = 0.007; effect magnitude: moderate) and economic (&#961; = 0.615; P-value < 0.001; effect magnitude: strong) inequalities was found in a state-level analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This population-based study showed important regional differences in COVID-19 estimates for children in Brazil and a relationship between mortality rates and socio-economic inequalities. The knowledge of sociogeographic differences in the estimates of COVID-19 is crucial to planning societal strategies and local decision-making to mitigate the effects of disease in the pediatric population.","Martins-Filho, P R; Quintans-Júnior, L J; de Souza Araújo, A A; Sposato, K B; Souza Tavares, C S; Gurgel, R Q; Fontes Leite, D C; de Paiva, S M; Santos, H P; Santos, V S",Public Health,,52
336635,"Molecular processes mediating hyperhomocysteinemia-induced metabolic reprogramming, redox regulation and growth inhibition in endothelial cells",2021,"Remote therapy has been used by analytic therapists for quite some time, though many have been reluctant to use it regularly, out of concern that it might distort analytic frame and relational dynamics. Now the Covid-19 pandemic has forced therapists to make a sudden, across-the-board transition to remote therapy. This study reports on survey responses from 190 analytic therapists on their transition to online therapy via videoconferencing during the pandemic and their previous experience with remote therapy (the majority had such experience). During the pandemic they prepared themselves and their patients for the transition in a variety of ways. The majority of those surveyed reported feeling as confident and as competent in their online sessions as in their earlier in-person work. Moreover, despite technical and relational challenges, they remained as strong, emotionally connected, and authentic in their online therapy sessions as they were in person. These experiences during the pandemic led to more positive views of online therapy than they held before, but a majority still considered online therapy less effective than in-person sessions.","Békés, Vera; Aafjes-van Doorn, Katie; Prout, Tracy A; Hoffman, Leon",J Am Psychoanal Assoc,,52

339075,Integration of genetically regulated gene expression and pharmacological library provides therapeutic drug candidates,2021,"Increasing attention has been devoted to allosteric modulators as the preferred therapeutic agents for their colossal advantages such as higher selectivity, fewer side effects, and lower toxicity since they bind at allosteric sites that are topographically distinct from the classic orthosteric sites. However, the allosteric binding pockets are not conserved and there are no cogent methods to comprehensively characterize the features of allosteric sites with the binding of modulators. To overcome this limitation, our lab has developed a novel algorithm that can quantitatively characterize the receptor-ligand binding feature named Molecular Complex Characterizing System (MCCS). To illustrate the methodology and application of MCCS, we take G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) as an example. First, we summarized and analyzed the reported allosteric binding pockets of class A GPCRs using MCCS. Sequentially, a systematic study was conducted between cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) and its allosteric modulators, where we used MCCS to analyze the residue energy contribution and the interaction pattern. Finally, we validated the predicted allosteric binding site in CB2 via MCCS in combination with molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Our results demonstrate that the MCCS program is advantageous in recapitulating the allosteric regulation pattern of class A GPCRs of the reported pockets as well as in predicting potential allosteric binding pockets. This MCCS program can serve as a valuable tool for the discovery of small-molecule allosteric modulators for class A GPCRs.","Feng, Zhiwei; Liang, Tianjian; Wang, Siyi; Chen, Maozi; Hou, Tianling; Zhao, Jack; Chen, Hui; Zhou, Yuehan; Xie, Xiang-Qun",ACS chem. neurosci,,52
339866,A Genotype-to-Phenotype Modeling Framework to Predict Human Pathogenicity of Novel Coronaviruses,2021,"Adolescence, a period of physical, social, cognitive and emotional development, represents a target population for sexual health promotion and education when it comes to achieving the 2030 Agenda goals for sustainable and equitable societies. The aim of this study is to provide an overview of what is known about the dissemination and effectiveness of sex education programs and thereby to inform better public policy making in this area. Methodology: We carried out a systematic review based on international scientific literature, in which only peer-reviewed papers were included. To identify reviews, we carried out an electronic search of the Cochrane Database Reviews, ERIC, Web of Science, PubMed, Medline, Scopus and PsycINFO. This paper provides a narrative review of reviews of the literature from 2015 to 2020. Results: 20 reviews met the inclusion criteria (10 in school settings, 9 using digital platforms and 1 blended learning program): they focused mainly on reducing risk behaviors (e.g., VIH/STIs and unwanted pregnancies), whilst obviating themes such as desire and pleasure, which were not included in outcome evaluations. The reviews with the lowest risk of bias are those carried out in school settings and are the ones that most question the effectiveness of sex education programs. Whilst the reviews of digital platforms and blended learning show greater effectiveness in terms of promoting sexual and reproductive health in adolescents (ASRH), they nevertheless also include greater risks of bias. Conclusion: A more rigorous assessment of the effectiveness of sexual education programs is necessary, especially regarding the opportunities offered by new technologies, which may lead to more cost-effective interventions than with in-person programs. Moreover, blended learning programs offer a promising way forward, as they combine the best of face-to-face and digital interventions, and may provide an excellent tool in the new context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lameiras-Fernández, María; Martínez-Román, Rosana; Carrera-Fernández, María Victoria; Rodríguez-Castro, Yolanda",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,52

343945,Natural cardenolides suppress coronaviral replication by downregulating JAK1 via a Na+/K+-ATPase independent proteolysis,2020,"Poly-(ADP)-ribose polymerases (PARPs) are a family of 17 enzymes in humans that have diverse roles in cell physiology including DNA damage repair, transcription, innate immunity, and regulation of signaling pathways. The modular domain architecture of PARPs gives rise to this functional diversity. PARPs catalyze the transfer of ADP-ribose from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to targets-proteins and poly-nucleic acids. This enigmatic post-translational modification comes in two varieties: the transfer of a single unit of ADP-ribose, known as mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) or the transfer of multiple units of ADP-ribose, known as poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation). Emerging data shows that PARPs are regulated at multiple levels to control when and where PARP-mediated M/PARylation occurs in cells. In this review, we will discuss the latest knowledge regarding the regulation of PARPs in cells: from transcription and protein stability to subcellular localization and modulation of catalytic activity.","Sanderson, Daniel J; Cohen, Michael S",Crit Rev Biochem Mol Biol,,52

344931,Journal roundup,2020,"BACKGROUND: Mechanical ventilation is used to treat respiratory failure in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). PURPOSE: To review multiple streams of evidence regarding the benefits and harms of ventilation techniques for coronavirus infections, including that causing COVID-19. DATA SOURCES: 21 standard, World Health Organization-specific and COVID-19-specific databases, without language restrictions, until 1 May 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Studies of any design and language comparing different oxygenation approaches in patients with coronavirus infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), or with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Animal, mechanistic, laboratory, and preclinical evidence was gathered regarding aerosol dispersion of coronavirus. Studies evaluating risk for virus transmission to health care workers from aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Independent and duplicate screening, data abstraction, and risk-of-bias assessment (GRADE for certainty of evidence and AMSTAR 2 for included systematic reviews). DATA SYNTHESIS: 123 studies were eligible (45 on COVID-19, 70 on SARS, 8 on MERS), but only 5 studies (1 on COVID-19, 3 on SARS, 1 on MERS) adjusted for important confounders. A study in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 reported slightly higher mortality with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) than with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), but 2 opposing studies, 1 in patients with MERS and 1 in patients with SARS, suggest a reduction in mortality with NIV (very-low-certainty evidence). Two studies in patients with SARS report a reduction in mortality with NIV compared with no mechanical ventilation (low-certainty evidence). Two systematic reviews suggest a large reduction in mortality with NIV compared with conventional oxygen therapy. Other included studies suggest increased odds of transmission from AGPs. LIMITATION: Direct studies in COVID-19 are limited and poorly reported. CONCLUSION: Indirect and low-certainty evidence suggests that use of NIV, similar to IMV, probably reduces mortality but may increase the risk for transmission of COVID-19 to health care workers.

MethodsThis was a prospective cohort study using questionnaires about COVID-19 administered to Japanese workers. A baseline survey conducted on December 22-25, 2020, was used to determine history of being diagnosed with COVID-19 or being identified as a close contact of an infected person. Unemployment since the baseline survey was ascertained with a follow-up survey on February 18 and 19, 2021. The odds ratios of unemployment were estimated using a multilevel logistic model with adjusted covariates nested in prefecture of residence. ResultsWomen (n = 8,771) accounted for 44% of the total sample (n = 19,941), and the mean age was 48.0 years. In terms of unemployment because of negative reasons, the multivariate analysis showed that the odds ratio of unemployment associated with being diagnosed with COVID-19 was 2.18 (95% CI: 1.05-4.55) and that the odds ratio associated with being identified as a close contact was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.29-2.95). ConclusionsThere is an association between workers being diagnosed with COVID-19 and unemployment. Occupational health professionals should follow up closely with workers diagnosed with COVID-19 after they return to work to prevent them from becoming unemployed against their will.","Nagata, Tomohisa; Nagata, Masako; Hino, Ayako; Tateishi, Seiichiro; Ogami, Akira; Tsuji, Mayumi; Matsuda, Shinya; Fujino, Yoshihisa; Mori, Koji",,,52

OBJECTIVE: To understand clinician perspectives on adaptations to end-of-life care for dying patients and their families during the pandemic. DESIGN: Mixed-methods embedded study. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04602520). SETTING: 3 acute care medical units in a tertiary care hospital from 16 March to 1 July 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 45 dying patients, 45 family members, and 45 clinicians. INTERVENTION: During the pandemic, clinicians continued an existing practice of collating personal information about dying patients and ""what matters most,"" eliciting wishes, and implementing acts of compassion. MEASUREMENTS: Themes from semistructured clinician interviews that were summarized with representative quotations. RESULTS: Many barriers to end-of-life care arose because of infection control practices that mandated visiting restrictions and personal protective equipment, with attendant practical and psychological consequences. During hospitalization, family visits inside or outside the patient's room were possible for 36 patients (80.0%); 13 patients (28.9%) had virtual visits with a relative or friend. At the time of death, 20 patients (44.4%) had a family member at the bedside. Clinicians endeavored to prevent unmarked deaths by adopting advocacy roles to ""fill the gap"" of absent family and by initiating new and established ways to connect patients and relatives. LIMITATION: Absence of clinician symptom or wellness metrics; a single-center design.

METHODS: Here a proposal of a seamless, adaptive, phase 1-3 trial for accelerated vaccine development is described. RESULTS: Starting at 10, the number of vaccinated volunteers would exponentially increase by tenfold at an interval of 2 weeks; close surveillance of antibody responses, safety and efficacy is necessary. After only 16 weeks, general vaccination would be feasible if supply meets the demand. CONCLUSION: A COVID-19 vaccine would be rapidly available at a slightly increased risk for undetected late side effects or insufficient efficacy if compared with standard vaccine development schemes.","Wehling, Martin",Eur J Clin Pharmacol,,52
358578,"New international guidance on quality, safety and efficacy of DNA vaccines",2020,"We study the effect of social distancing, food vulnerability, welfare and labour COVID-19 policy responses on riots, violence against civilians and food-related conflicts. Our analysis uses georeferenced data for 24 African countries with monthly local prices and real-time conflict data reported in the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) from January 2015 until early May 2020. Lockdowns and recent welfare policies have been implemented in light of COVID-19, but in some contexts also likely in response to ongoing conflicts. To mitigate the potential risk of endogeneity, we use instrumental variables. We exploit the exogeneity of global commodity prices, and three variables that increase the risk of COVID-19 and efficiency in response such as countries colonial heritage, male mortality rate attributed to air pollution and prevalence of diabetes in adults. We find that the probability of experiencing riots, violence against civilians, food-related conflicts and food looting has increased since lockdowns. Food vulnerability has been a contributing factor. A 10% increase in the local price index is associated with an increase of 0.7 percentage points in violence against civilians. Nonetheless, for every additional anti-poverty measure implemented in response to COVID-19 the probability of experiencing violence against civilians, riots and food-related conflicts declines by approximately 0.2 percentage points. These anti-poverty measures also reduce the number of fatalities associated with these conflicts. Overall, our findings reveal that food vulnerability has increased conflict risks, but also offer an optimistic view of the importance of the state in providing an extensive welfare safety net.","Guti'errez-Romero, Roxana",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10696v1.pdf,52

This study aimed to analyze the progression of the consumption of anxiolytics (ATC classification: N05B) dispensed in pharmacies in Castile and Leon, Spain, from 2015 to 2020, with a special focus on the possible impact of COVID-19 on the use of these drugs. A quantitative-qualitative analysis of usage was carried out using the total number of packs and the packs per 1000 inhabitants. Overall, the use of anxiolytics grew by 14.41% during 2015-2020. The most commonly used drugs were the short-acting benzodiazepine derivatives lorazepam (whose use increased by 15.18%) and alprazolam (whose use increased by 21.40%), and the dispensing of the long-acting derivative diazepam increased the most, by 31.83%. Anxiolytics consumption increased significantly in 2020 and peaked in March. The pattern of use remained the same in 2020. The consumption of anxiolytics has continued to increase in Castile and Leon over the last six years. The COVID-19 pandemic situation affected the dispensing of these drugs, causing a sharp increase in prescriptions, especially during March, when the confinement of the population was initiated.","Sánchez Díaz, Miryam; Martín-Calvo, María Luisa; Mateos-Campos, Ramona",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,52

METHODS: We conducted a multicentre randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial evaluating hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients with at least one of the following risk factors for worsening: need for supplemental oxygen, age &#8805;75 years, age between 60 - 74 years and presence of at least one comorbidity. Severely ill patients requiring oxygen therapy > 3L/min or intensive care were excluded. Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 800mg hydroxychloroquine on Day 0 followed by 400mg per day for 8 days or a placebo. The primary endpoint was a composite of death or start of invasive mechanical ventilation within 14 days following randomization. Secondary endpoints included mortality and clinical evolution at Day 14 and 28, viral shedding at Day 5 and 10. RESULTS: The trial was stopped after 250 patients were included due to a slowdown of the pandemic in France. The intention-to-treat population comprised 123 and 124 patients in the placebo and hydroxychloroquine groups, respectively. The median age was 77 (interquartile range 58 - 86) years and 151/250 (60.4%) patients required oxygen therapy. The primary endpoint occurred in 9/124 (7.3%) patients in the hydroxychloroquine group and 8/123 (6.5%) patients in the placebo group (relative risk 1.12; 95% confidence interval 0.45- 2.80). The rate of positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR at day 5 and 10 was 72.8% (75/103) and 57.1% (52/91) in the hydroxychloroquine group, versus 73.0% (73/100) and 56.6% (47/83) in the placebo group, respectively. No difference was observed between the two groups in any of the other secondary endpoints. CONCLUSION: In this underpowered trial involving mainly older patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, patients treated with hydroxychloroquine did not experience better clinical or virological outcomes than those receiving the placebo.","Dubée, Vincent; Roy, Pierre-Marie; Vielle, Bruno; Parot-Schinkel, Elsa; Blanchet, Odile; Darsonval, Astrid; Lefeuvre, Caroline; Abbara, Chadi; Boucher, Sophie; Devaud, Edouard; Robineau, Olivier; Rispal, Patrick; Guimard, Thomas; d039,; Anglejean, Emma; Diamantis, Sylvain; Custaud, Marc-Antoine; Pellier, Isabelle; Mercat, Alain",Clin. microbiol. infect,,52

366095,The Use of Antimicrobial and Antiviral Drugs in Alzheimer’s Disease,2020,"We discuss a stochastic model to assess cumulative excess deaths during Covid-19-like epidemics for various non-pharmaceutic interventions. The model simulates three interrelated stochastic processes: epidemic spreading, availability of respiratory ventilators and changes in death statistics. Epidemic may spread either locally or globally. The local mode simulates virus transmission through contacts in the vicinity of the place of residence while the global mode simulates virus transmission through social mixing in public places, sport arenas, airports, etc, where many people meet, who live in remote geographic locations. Epidemic is modelled as a discrete time stochastic process on random geometric networks. In the simulations we assume that the basic reproduction number is $R_0=2.5$ and the infectious period lasts ca. ten days. We also assume that the virus leads to severe acute respiratory syndrome in about one percent of cases, which in turn almost surely lead to respiratory default and death, unless the patient receives an appropriate medical treatment supported by respiratory ventilation. For other parameters, like mortality rate or the number of respiratory ventilators per million of inhabitants, we take values typical for developed countries. We simulate populations of $10^5-10^6$ people. We compare different strategies: do-nothing, social distancing, reduction of social mixing and lockdown, assuming that there is no vaccine and no efficient medicine. The results of the simulations show that strategies that slow down the spread of epidemic too much are inefficient in reducing the cumulative excess of deaths. A hybrid strategy in which lockdown is in place for some time and is then completely released is inefficient as well.","Burda, Zdzislaw",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.15583v1.pdf,52

371828,Muscle-derived Myoglianin regulates Drosophila imaginal disc growth,2020,"COVID-19 has spawned an age of mask-wearing and closure of many establishments. Words such as quarantine, ?the practice of separating individuals who have had contact with someone with COVID,? and social distancing, the ?practice of increasing the space between individuals to reduce the risk of spreading a disease,? have become normal in conversation. With 440,000 deaths in the US, cases continue to impact the global economy. Quarantining and social distancing may be the only way to prevent spread even with vaccine distribution. Included in the closures are medical schools. With one percent of Americans employed as physicians, the country entrusts few to maintain health for millions. In a profession with personal contact, the lack of in-person training may hinder the ability of physicians to achieve this goal. The purpose of this preliminary study was to examine current physicians-in-training, and their ability to diagnose and treat pathology while adapting to the distanced education due to COVID-19. Second-year students from two medical schools were surveyed with a questionnaire comprised of eight areas of suggestion to: assess confidence in pathology recognition on licensure examinations, confidence in pathology recognition in clinical settings, and the impact of COVID-19 on clinical competency skills. Results It was found that thirteen percent of students found online lectures to be very effective, with fifty-eight percent of students claiming moderate effective. Twenty-three percent of students share improved exam performance with online school, and seventy-seven percent of students had no change. Nearly ninety-two percent of students supplement coursework with other resources. Twenty-three percent of students feel very confident in their ability to recognize pathology on boards. Zero percent of students feel very confident in recognition in clinical settings. Over fifty percent of students feel their clinical competency skills have worsened. Students do not feel confident in their ability to care for a patient. Students do, however, feel confident for exams. Online education has shown to be effective in teaching nurses, and the same applies to medical school. With 70% of responses showing online lectures are effective, the conclusion is pathology can be taught without traditional means. Suggestions include condensation of material even further, proving students do not have issue with an online format. Total replacement for in-class learning does not seem applicable. While students have confidence in exam skills, confidence disappears when in a clinical setting. There is a difference between answering a clinical vignette and solving the presentation of a vignette in the clinic. More than 50% of students do not feel prepared clinically, showing that the online medical education is inadequate for teaching the basics of clinical duties, such as history and physical exam. With all of the current cohort lacking in-person training, those who do not feel prepared clinically may rise. Research has shown that COVID-19 may be the start of a change in medicine with advancements of telehealth;however, this is from the perspective of educators. The student shows low confidence for patient care due to the pandemic. Future studies will follow this cohort as they progress from online education to clinical rotation and beyond.","Torelli, Vincent Tran Elena Lomiguen Christine",The FASEB Journal,,52

373938,Antiviral agents,2020,"Objective A pilot study to: (1) describe the ability of emergency physicians to provide primary consults at an Australian, major metropolitan, adult emergency department (ED) during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared with historical performance; and (2) to identify the effect of system and process factors on productivity. Methods A retrospective cross-sectional description of shifts worked between 1 and 29 February 2020, while physicians were carrying out their usual supervision, flow and problem-solving duties, as well as undertaking additional COVID-19 preparation, was documented. Effect of supervisory load, years of Australian registration and departmental flow factors were evaluated. Descriptive statistical methods were used and regression analyses were performed. Results A total of 188 shifts were analysed. Productivity was 4.07 patients per 9.5-h shift (95% CI 3.56-4.58) or 0.43 patients per h, representing a 48.5% reduction from previously published data (P<0.0001). Working in a shift outside of the resuscitation area or working a day shift was associated with a reduction in individual patient load. There was a 2.2% (95% CI: 1.1-3.4, P<0.001) decrease in productivity with each year after obtaining Australian medical registration. There was a 10.6% (95% CI: 5.4-15.6, P<0.001) decrease in productivity for each junior physician supervised. Bed access had no statistically significant effect on productivity. Conclusions Emergency physicians undertake multiple duties. Their ability to manage their own patients varies depending on multiple ED operational factors, particularly their supervisory load. COVID-19 preparations reduced their ability to see their own patients by half. What is known about the topic? An understanding of emergency physician productivity is essential in planning clinical operations. Medical productivity, however, is challenging to define, and is controversial to measure. Although baseline data exist, few studies examine the effect of patient flow and supervision requirements on the emergency physician's ability to perform primary consults. No studies describe these metrics during COVID-19. What does this paper add? This pilot study provides a novel cross-sectional description of the effect of COVID-19 preparations on the ability of emergency physicians to provide direct patient care. It also examines the effect of selected system and process factors in a physician's ability to complete primary consults. What are the implications for practitioners? When managing an emergency medical workforce, the contribution of emergency physicians to the number of patients requiring consults should take into account the high volume of alternative duties required. Increasing alternative duties can decrease primary provider tasks that can be completed. COVID-19 pandemic preparation has significantly reduced the ability of emergency physicians to manage their own patients.","Lim, Andy; Gupta, Namankit; Lim, Alvin; Hong, Wei; Walker, Katie",Aust Health Rev,,52

SARS-CoV-2 targets the respiratory system, resulting in symptoms such as fever, headache, dry cough, dyspnea, and dizziness. These symptoms vary from person to person, ranging from mild to hypoxia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sometimes death. Although not confirmed, phylogenetic analysis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may have originated from bats; the intermediary facilitating its transfer from bats to humans is unknown. Owing to the rapid spread of infection and high number of deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2, most countries have enacted strict curfews and the practice of social distancing while awaiting the availability of effective U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications and/or vaccines. This review offers an overview of the various types of coronaviruses (CoVs), their targeted hosts and cellular receptors, a timeline of their emergence, and the roles of key elements of the immune system in fighting pathogen attacks, while focusing on SARS-CoV-2 and its genomic structure and pathogenesis. Furthermore, we review drugs targeting COVID-19 that are under investigation and in clinical trials, in addition to progress using mesenchymal stem cells to treat COVID-19. We conclude by reviewing the latest updates on COVID-19 vaccine development. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with host cells and stimulates the immune response is extremely important, especially as scientists look for new strategies to guide their development of specific COVID-19 therapies and vaccines.","Alnefaie, Alaa; Albogami, Sarah",Saudi pharmaceutical journal,,52

Veterans and staff at a Veterans Affair (VA) medical center were surveyed 3 months after social distancing disrupted usual service delivery in intensive community-based treatment programs. Veterans (n = 105) and staff (n = 112) gave similar multi-item ratings of service delivery after social distancing, which involved far less face-to-face contact and more telephone contact than usual and rated their therapeutic alliances and clinical status similarly as ""not as good"" on average than before social distancing. Self-reported decline in therapeutic alliance was associated with parallel decline in clinical status indicators. Both veterans and staff indicated clear preference for return to face-to-face service delivery after the pandemic with some telehealth included.","Rosenheck, Robert; Johnson, Barbara; Deegan, Debbie; Stefanovics, Elina",J. nerv. ment. dis,,52

376847,Knowledge synthesis from 100 million biomedical documents augments the deep expression profiling of coronavirus receptors,2020-03-28,"To date the pathophysiology of COVID-19 remains unclear: this represents a factor determining the current lack of effective treatments. In this paper, we hypothesized a complex host response to SARS-CoV-2, with the Contact System (CS) playing a pivotal role in innate immune response. CS is linked with different proteolytic defense systems operating in human vasculature: the Kallikrein-Kinin (KKS), the Coagulation/Fibrinolysis and the Renin-Angiotensin (RAS) Systems. We investigated the role of the mediators involved. CS consists of Factor XII (FXII) and plasma prekallikrein (complexed to high-molecular-weight kininogen-HK). Autoactivation of FXII by contact with SARS-CoV-2 could lead to activation of intrinsic coagulation, with fibrin formation (microthrombosis), and fibrinolysis, resulting in increased D-dimer levels. Activation of kallikrein by activated FXII leads to production of bradykinin (BK) from HK. BK binds to B2-receptors, mediating vascular permeability, vasodilation and edema. B1-receptors, binding the metabolite [des-Arg9]-BK (DABK), are up-regulated during infections and mediate lung inflammatory responses. BK could play a relevant role in COVID-19 as already described for other viral models. Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme (ACE) 2 displays lung protective effects: it inactivates DABK and converts Angiotensin II (Ang II) into Angiotensin-(1-7) and Angiotensin I into Angiotensin-(1-9). SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 for cell entry, downregulating it: an impaired DABK inactivation could lead to an enhanced activity of B1-receptors, and the accumulation of Ang II, through a negative feedback loop, may result in decreased ACE activity, with consequent increase of BK. Therapies targeting the CS, the KKS and action of BK could be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.","Meini, Simone; Zanichelli, Andrea; Sbrojavacca, Rodolfo; Iuri, Federico; Roberts, Anna Teresa; Suffritti, Chiara; Tascini, Carlo",Front Immunol,,52

However, conventional terrestrial cellular networks have unfortunately neglected the huge geographical digital divide, since high bandwidth wireless coverage is concentrated to urban areas. To meet the goal of ``connecting the unconnected'', integrating low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites with the terrestrial cellular networks has been widely considered as a promising solution. In this article, we first introduce the development roadmap of LEO satellite constellations (SatCons), including early attempts in LEO satellites with the emerging LEO constellations. Further, we discuss the unique opportunities of employing LEO SatCons for the delivery of integrating 5G networks. Specifically, we present their key performance indicators, which offer important guidelines for the design of associated enabling techniques, and then discuss the potential impact of integrating LEO SatCons with typical 5G use cases, where we engrave our vision of various vertical domains reshaped by LEO SatCons. Technical challenges are finally provided to specify future research directions.","Liu, Shicong; Gao, Zhen; Wu, Yongpeng; Ng, Derrick Wing Kwan; Gao, Xiqi; Wong, Kai-Kit; Chatzinotas, Symeon; Ottersten, Bjorn",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09897v1.pdf,52

These model predictions have shown a wide range of variations. In our study, we demonstrate that nonidentifiability in model calibrations using the confirmed-case data is the main reason for such wide variations. Using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for model selection, we show that an SIR model performs much better than an SEIR model in representing the information contained in the confirmed-case data. This indicates that predictions using more complex models may not be more reliable compared to using a simpler model. We present our model predictions for the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan after the lockdown and quarantine of the city on January 23, 2020. We also report our results of modeling the impacts of the strict quarantine measures undertaken in the city after February 7 on the time course of the epidemic, and modeling the potential of a second outbreak after the return-to-work in the city.","Roda, Weston C.; Varughese, Marie B.; Han, Donglin; Li, Michael Y.",Infect.

Youth with disabilities are at particular risk for the psychological implications of the pandemic. Although much attention has been given to pandemic-related mental health challenges that youth have encountered, little is known about the facilitators for coping with the stresses of the pandemic and how this varies for youth with and without disabilities. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to understand facilitators for helping youth and young adults with and without disabilities to cope and maintain mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This qualitative study involved in-depth interviews with 34 youth and young adults (17 with a disability; 17 without), aged 16-29 (mean age 23.2). A narrative, thematic analysis of the transcripts was performed. RESULTS: Our findings revealed several similarities and some differences between youth and young adults with and without disabilities regarding facilitators for maintaining mental health during the pandemic. Enablers of coping included: (1) social support; (2) financial support, (3) keeping busy (i.e., having a daily routine, working to keep the mind occupied, volunteering to boost mental health, focusing on school work), and (4) work-life balance (i.e., reduced commute, more time for exercising, going outdoors, cooking, sleeping better, and reflection on life's purpose). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight how having coping strategies could help to youth and young adults deal with pandemic-related stress. Youth with disabilities may need some additional support in accessing resources, exercising and going outdoors to help enhance their coping strategies.","Lindsay, Sally; Ahmed, Hiba; Apostolopoulos, Demitra",Disabil Health J,,52

381709,Signals of hope: gauging the impact of a rapid national vaccination campaign,2021,"BACKGROUND: A high proportion of COVID-19 patients have cardiac involvement, even those without known cardiac disease. Downregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and the renin-angiotensin system, as well as inflammatory mechanisms have been suggested to play a role. ACE2 is abundant in the gut and associated with gut microbiota composition. We hypothesized that gut leakage of microbial products, and subsequent inflammasome activation could contribute to cardiac involvement in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Plasma levels of a gut leakage marker (LPS-binding protein, LBP), a marker of enterocyte damage (intestinal fatty acid binding protein, IFABP), a gut homing marker (CCL25, ligand for chemokine receptor CCR9) and markers of inflammasome activation (IL-1ß, IL-18 and their regulatory proteins) were measured at three time points (day 1, 3-5 and 7-10) in 39 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and related to cardiac involvement. RESULTS: Compared to controls, COVID-19 patients had elevated plasma levels of LBP and CCL25 but not IFABP, suggesting impaired gut barrier function and accentuated gut homing of T cells without excessive enterocyte damage. Levels of LBP were twice as high at baseline in patients with elevated cardiac markers compared with those without and remained elevated during hospitalization. Also, markers of inflammasome activation were moderately elevated in patients with cardiac involvement. LBP was associated with higher NT-pro-BNP levels, whereas IL-18, IL-18BP and IL-1Ra were associated with higher troponin levels. CONCLUSION: Patients with cardiac involvement had elevated markers of gut leakage and inflammasome activation, suggestive of a potential gut-heart axis in COVID-19.","Hoel, H; Heggelund, L; Reikvam, D H; Stiksrud, B; Ueland, T; Michelsen, A E; Otterdal, K; Muller, K E; Lind, A; Muller, F; Dudman, S; Aukrust, P; Dyrhol-Riise, A M; Holter, J C; Trøseid, M",J. intern. med,,52
381710,Signals of hope: gauging the impact of a rapid national vaccination campaign,2021,"This paper presents a state estimation-based robust optimal control strategy for influenza epidemics in an interactive human society in the presence of modeling uncertainties. Interactive society is influenced by the random entrance of individuals from other human societies whose effects can be modeled as a non-Gaussian noise. Since only the number of exposed and infected humans can be measured, states of the influenza epidemics are first estimated by an extended maximum correntropy Kalman filter (EMCKF) to provide a robust state estimation in the presence of the non-Gaussian noise. An online quadratic program (QP) optimization is then synthesized subject to a robust control Lyapunov function (RCLF) to minimize susceptible and infected humans, while minimizing and bounding the rates of vaccination and antiviral treatment. The joint QP-RCLF-EMCKF meets multiple design specifications such as state estimation, tracking, pointwise control optimality, and robustness to parameter uncertainty and state estimation errors that have not been achieved simultaneously in previous studies. The uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB)/convergence of error trajectories is guaranteed using a Lyapunov stability argument. The soundness of the proposed approach is validated on the influenza epidemics of an interactive human society with a population of 16000. Simulation results show that the QP-RCLF-EMCKF achieves appropriate tracking and state estimation performance. The robustness of the proposed controller is finally illustrated in the presence of modeling error and non-Gaussian noise.","Azimi, Vahid; Sharifi, Mojtaba; Fakoorian, Seyed; Nguyen, Thang Tien",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.13101v1.pdf,52

383774,Mouse Sertoli cells isolation by lineage tracing and sorting,2020,"Numerous analyses of the benefits and costs of COVID-19 policies have been completed quickly as the crisis has unfolded. The results often largely depend on the approach used to value mortality risk reductions, typically expressed as the value per statistical life (VSL). Many analyses rely on a population-average VSL estimate; some adjust VSL for life expectancy at the age of death. We explore the implications of theory and empirical studies, which suggest that the relationship between age and VSL is uncertain. We compare the effects of three approaches: (1) an invariant population-average VSL; (2) a constant value per statistical life-year (VSLY); and (3) a VSL that follows an inverse-U pattern, peaking in middle age. We find that when applied to the U.S. age distribution of COVID-19 deaths, these approaches result in average VSL estimates of $10.63 million, $4.47 million, and $8.31 million. We explore the extent to which applying these estimates alters the conclusions of frequently cited analyses of social distancing, finding that they significantly affect the findings. However, these analyses do not address other characteristics of COVID-19 deaths that may increase or decrease the VSL estimates. Examples include the health status and income level of those affected, the size of the risk change, and the extent to which the risk is dreaded, uncertain, involuntarily incurred, and outside of one's control. The effects of these characteristics and their correlation with age are uncertain; it is unclear whether they amplify or diminish the effects of age on VSL.","Robinson, Lisa A; Sullivan, Ryan; Shogren, Jason F",Risk anal,,52

Especially, in preparation for expected mass casualty incident it is necessary to distinguish early and efficiently between outpatient and inpatient treatment including the need for intensive care therapy. METHODS: We present a model for a safe and efficient triage, which is established and used in the university hospital of Essen, Germany. It is intended for a non-disaster situation. This model is a combination of clinical assessment by using vital parameters and Manchester triage scale (MTS). Possible additional parameters are POCT (point-of-care-testing) values, electrocardiogram, CT pulmonary angiography, SARS-Cov2-PCR as well as detailed diagnostic of laboratory values. The model was validated by 100 consecutive patients. We demonstrate three patients to illustrate this model. RESULTS: During the first two weeks after implementing this model in our normal operation at the emergency department, we had an efficient selectivity between need for inpatient and outpatient treatment. 16 patients were classified as ""inpatients"" according to initial assessment. Among 84 patients who were initially classified as ""outpatients"", 7 patients returned to our emergency department within 14 days. Three of these patients returned due to complaints other than COVID19. One female patient had to be admitted due to progressive dyspnea. CONCLUSIONS: This introduced triage-model seems to be an efficient concept. Adjustment might be necessary after further experience and after a growing number of patients.","Fistera, David; Risse, Joachim; Manegold, Randi; Pabst, Dirk; Konik, Margarete; Dolff, Sebastian; Witzke, Oliver; Schaarschmidt, Benedikt Michael; Taube, Christian; Kill, Clemens; Holzner, Carola",Dtsch. med. wochenschr,,52

388095,A new coronavirus associated with human respiratory disease in China,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought into focus a shift in the communication of health-related information. Traditionally, public service announcements (PSAs) consisted of video or radio messages, posters, or billboards created by government agencies and health organizations to provide information about health topics. However, the widespread use of the internet and the growth of social media has changed PSA creation and dissemination in many ways. Increasingly, a variety of actors, including non-official sources and lay persons, have been using social media to disseminate PSAs or PSA-like content. Audiences are larger and more engaged with content, and users have the novel ability to interact with PSAs through shares, likes, or comments. While social media for health communication has many advantages, there are also a number of disadvantages including misinformation, conspiracy theories, bots, and trolls. Credibility of different sources has also become a topic of debate. An ongoing challenge during the pandemic has been reaching audiences in a crowded online environment, establishing authority as a trusted source, and countering misinformation. In this paper, we discuss how the media landscape is changing PSAs and the implications of these changes in the context of pandemics.","Manganello, Jennifer; Bleakley, Amy; Schumacher, Patrick",Health Commun,,52

Our analyses involving molecular phylogenetics is a step toward understanding the transmission clusters that can be correlated to pathophysiology of the disease to gain insight into virulence mechanism. As the infections are increasing rapidly, more divergence is expected followed possibly by viral adaptation. We could identify mutational hotspots which appear to be major drivers of diversity among strains, with RBD of spike protein emerging as the key region involved in interaction with ACE2 and consequently a major determinant of infection outcome. We believe that such molecular analyses correlated with clinical characteristics and host predisposition need to be evaluated at the earliest to understand viral adaptability, disease prognosis, and transmission dynamics.","Sheikh, Javaid Ahmad; Singh, Jasdeep; Singh, Hina; Jamal, Salma; Khubaib, Mohd; Kohli, Sunil; Dobrindt, Ulrich; Rahman, Syed Asad; Ehtesham, Nasreen Zafar; Hasnain, Seyed Ehtesham",Infect Genet Evol,,52
389115,Vertical Transmission,2020,"BackgroundThe epidemiology of the Coronavirus-disease associated mucormycosis (CAM) syndemic is poorly elucidated. We aimed to identify risk factors that may explain the burden of cases and help develop preventive strategies. MethodsWe performed a case-control study comparing cases diagnosed with CAM and those who had recovered from COVID-19 without developing mucormycosis (controls). Information on comorbidities, glycemic control, and practices related to COVID-19 prevention and treatment was recorded. Results352 patients (152 cases and 200 controls) diagnosed with COVID-19 during April-May 2021 were included. In the CAM group, symptoms of mucormycosis began a mean 18.9 (SD 9.1) days after onset of COVID-19, and predominantly rhino-sinus and orbital involvement was present. All, but one, CAM cases carried conventional risk factors of diabetes and steroid use. On multivariable regression, increased odds of CAM were associated with the presence of diabetes (adjusted OR 3.5, 95%CI 1.1-11), use of systemic steroids (aOR 7.7,95% CI 2.4-24.7), prolonged use of cloth and surgical masks (vs no mask, aOR 6.9, 95%CI 1.5-33.1), and repeated nasopharyngeal swab testing during the COVID-19 illness (aOR 1.6,95% CI 1.2-2.2). Zinc therapy, probably due to its utility in immune function, was found to be protective (aOR 0.05, 95%CI 0.01-0.19). Notably, the requirement of oxygen supplementation or hospitalization did not affect the risk of CAM. ConclusionJudicious use of steroids and stringent glycemic control are vital to preventing mucormycosis. Use of clean masks, preference for N95 masks if available, and minimizing swab testing after the diagnosis of COVID-19 may further reduce the incidence of CAM.","Arora, Umang; Priyadarshi, Megha; Katiyar, Varidh; Soneja, Manish; Garg, Prerna; Gupta, Ishan; Bharadiya, Vishwesh; Berry, Parul; Ghosh, Tamoghna; Patel, Lajjaben; Sarda, Radhika; Garg, Shreya; Agarwal, Shubham; Arora, Veronica; Ramprasad, Aishwarya; Kumar, Amit; Garg, Rohit Kumar; Kodan, Parul; Nischal, Neeraj; Singh, Gagandeep; Jorwal, Pankaj; Kumar, Arvind; Baitha, Upendra; Meena, Ved Prakash; Ray, Animesh; Sethi, Prayas; Xess, Immaculata; Vikram, Naval Kishore; Sinha, Sanjeev; Biswas, Ashutosh; Thakar, Alok; Bhatnagar, Sushma; Trikha, Anjan; Wig, Naveet",,,52

The resultant disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has rapidly developed into a worldwide pandemic, leading to severe health and economic burdens. Although the recently announced vaccines against COVID-19 has rekindled hope, there is still a major challenge to urgently meet the global need for rapid treatment of the pandemic. Given the urgency of the CoV outbreak, we propose a strategy to screen potential broad-spectrum drugs against CoV in a high-throughput manner, particularly against SARS-CoV-2. Since the essential functional domains of CoV are extensively homologous, the availability of two types of mild CoV, HCoV-OC43 and MHV, should provide a valuable tool for the rapid identification of promising drugs against CoV without the drawbacks of level three biological confinements. The luciferase reporter gene is introduced into HCoV-OC43 and MHV to indicate viral activity, and hence the antiviral efficiency of screened drugs can be quantified by luciferase activity. Compounds with antiviral activity against both HCoV-OC43 and MHV are further evaluated in SARS-CoV-2 after structural optimizations. This system allows large-scale compounds to be screened to search for broad-spectrum drugs against CoV in a high-throughput manner, providing potential alternatives for clinical management of SARS-CoV-2 or other CoV.","Liu, Jia; Li, Kang; Cheng, Lin; Shao, Jingjin; Yang, Shukun; Zhang, Wei; Zhou, Guangqian; de Vries, Antoine A F; Yu, Zhiyi",Int J Infect Dis,,52

Using the figures from 72 epidemics, from the plague of Athens (429 BC) to the COVID-19 (2019-2020), they claim that the resulting fatality distribution is ``extremely fat-tailed'', i.e., asymptotically a power law. This has important consequences for risk, as the mean value of the fatality distribution becomes infinite. Reanalyzing the same data, we find that, although the data may be compatible with a power-law tail, these results are not conclusive, and other distributions, not fat-tailed, could explain the data equally well. Simulation of a log-normally distributed random variable provides synthetic data whose statistics are undistinguishable from the statistics of the empirical data.","Corral, Alvaro",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.06876v1.pdf,52

Although online learning seemed to be the best possible solution during the indefinite closure of institutes, however, the sudden change in teaching and learning paradigm was not well accepted and unprecedented challenges emerged. This study aims at identifying the barriers specific to students and teachers in this abrupt shift. Moreover, it examines the satisfaction level of undergraduate students regarding online education practices during the COVID-19 epidemic. The study employed a survey design and carried it out through two distinct questionnaires that are, for students and teachers. A total of 1280 students participated in students' questionnaire while 112 teachers contributed to filling out teachers' survey. Content Quality (CQ), Content Availability (CA), Teacher Interaction (TI), and Mode of Lecture Delivery (MLD) were considered as the predictor variables for student satisfaction. Regression and correlation analyses were performed to find out the contribution of the aforementioned variables. The survey results concluded that the lack of interaction among students and teachers is the major hurdle in online learning. Regression results revealed that the overall model with all four predictors was significantly predictive of student satisfaction. The results further revealed that MLD is the strongest and most significant of all.

Outcomes of this evolution have been particularly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic with accelerated development of vaccines and monoclonal antibodies, as well as novel clinical trial designs. These products were developed, trialled, manufactured, and authorised for use in several countries within a year of the pandemic's onset. Many gaps remain, however, that must be bridged to establish a truly efficient and effective end-to-end R&D preparedness and response ecosystem. Foremost among them is a global financing system. In addition, important changes are required for multiple aspects of enabling sciences and product development. For each of these elements we identify priorities for improved and faster functionality. There will be no better time than now to seriously address these needs, however difficult, as the ravages of COVID-19 continue to accelerate with devastating health, social, and economic consequences for the entire community of nations.","Lurie, Nicole; Keusch, Gerald T; Dzau, Victor J",Lancet,,52

However, a lack of proper knowledge about non-covalent interactions can act as a barrier towards gaining a complete understanding of the factors that control these associations. To find effective molecules for COVID-19 inhibition, we have quantitatively investigated 143 X-ray crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protein of coronavirus with covalently or non-covalently bound small molecules (SMs). Our present study is able to explain ordinary and perceptive aspects relating to protein inhibition. The active site of the protein consists of 21 amino acid residues, but only nine are actively involved in the ligand binding process. The H41, M49, and C145 residues have highest priority with respect to interactions with small molecules through hydrogen bond, CH-&#960;, and van der Waals interactions. At the active site, this ranking of amino acids is clear, based on different spatial orientations of ligands, and consistent with the electronic properties. SMs with aromatic moieties that bind to the active site of the protein play a distinct role in the determination of the following order of interaction frequency with the amino acids: CH-&#960; > H-bonding > polar interactions. This present study revealed that the G143 and C145 residues play crucial roles in the recognition of the carbonyl functionality of SMs through hydrogen bonding. With this knowledge in mind, an effective inhibitor small-molecule for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was designed: docking studies showed that the designed molecule has strong binding affinity towards the protein. The non-covalent interactions in the protein-ligand complex are in good agreement with the results obtained from X-ray crystallography. Moreover, the present study focused on weak forces and their influence on protein inhibition, henceforth shedding much light on the essential requirements for moieties that should be present in a good inhibitor and their orientations at the ligand binding site.","Sepay, Nayim; Saha, Pranab Chandra; Shahzadi, Zarrin; Chakraborty, Aratrika; Halder, Umesh Chandra",Phys Chem Chem Phys,,52

405280,Viral Emerging Diseases: Challenges in Developing Vaccination Strategies,2020,"Summary: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a massive impact on waits for elective operations, with tens of thousands of scheduled surgeries being cancelled or postponed across Canada. Provincial governments will likely not only reopen elective surgical capacity when it is deemed safe, but also target new funding to address the backlog of cases. There is a dearth of research on whether the provinces' approaches to managing wait lists are equitable from a patients' needs perspective or if they are associated with patients' perception of outcomes. The surgical cost models used in the past won't be useful to governments and hospital managers. New models based on hospitals' marginal costs, associated with running on weekends or off-hours and social distancing parameters, will be needed. Surgeon input, collaboration and leadership during the strategy development, implementation and management of surgical wait lists postpandemic will be imperative, as these decisions will significantly affect the health and lives of many Canadians.","Wiseman, Sam M; Crump, R Trafford; Sutherland, Jason M",Can J Surg,,52

In each of these tasks, our participation focused on the use of query-focused extractive summarisation to obtain the ideal answers to medical questions. The Synergy Task is an end-to-end question answering task on COVID-19 where systems are required to return relevant documents, snippets, and answers to a given question. Given the absence of training data, we used a query-focused summarisation system that was trained with the BioASQ8b training data set and we experimented with methods to retrieve the documents and snippets. Considering the poor quality of the documents and snippets retrieved by our system, we observed reasonably good quality in the answers returned. For phase B of the BioASQ9b task, the relevant documents and snippets were already included in the test data. Our system split the snippets into candidate sentences and used BERT variants under a sentence classification setup. The system used the question and candidate sentence as input and was trained to predict the likelihood of the candidate sentence being part of the ideal answer. The runs obtained either the best or second best ROUGE-F1 results of all participants to all batches of BioASQ9b. This shows that using BERT in a classification setup is a very strong baseline for the identification of ideal answers. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

We sought to determine the cost and success of implementation of a podcast for a surgical department in a large academic hospital. METHODS: We created a podcast series for Israeli medical students during the COVID-19 epidemic based on the Medical Student Core Curriculum of the American College of Surgeons / Association for Surgical Education. Episodes were available for free download or streaming on a designated website and popular podcast platforms. Podcast analytics were used to measure public listeners and uptake. RESULTS: Total development time was 90 hours at an estimated cost of $7091 USD. A total of 10 episodes were released between March 21, 2020 and August 31, 2020. An average of 9 ± 1.26 h (range 2-6) was required to generate each episode, including 3.4 ± 1.26 h (2-6) for content review and 5.6 ± 2 h (4-10) for audio production. An average episode ran for 35.9 ± 4.3 min (28-42). Podcasts recorded a total of 5678 downloads, with an average of 228 and 336 downloads per episode in the first 30 and 90 days, respectively. The average daily downloads before the students returned to clinical rotations (March 21-April 30) was 48 ± 58.3 (7-283;) compared to 16 ± 7.4 after their return (1-38; P< 0.01). Estimated costs to produce a video-based education series would have been significantly more. CONCLUSION: Podcasts can serve as a cost-effective and quickly produced instructional tool to supplement online learning.

METHODS: This is a prospective observational study in which breast milk samples were collected from 15 mothers with COVID-19.The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the whole human milk samples of the patients was investigated using RT-qPCR. All of the infants underwent a clinical follow-up during their 14-day isolation and their throat swab samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS: Of 15 mothers with COVID-19,SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in milk samples from 4 mothers. The throat swab samples from these mothers'infants were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.Three of the four mothers were breastfeeding. In addition, during the 14-day isolation,all but three of the mothers breastfed their infants. Of the 12 breastfed infants,while the test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in throat swab samples was negative in six of the infants, the other six infants,who had mild COVID-19 symptoms,tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.Clinical outcomes of all mothers and infants were uneventful. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first case series with the largest number of cases with SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity in human milk samples of mothers with COVID-19.

419635,Human pathogen coronaviruses - An overview,2020,"Background: Schools and outdoor public spaces play a substantial role in children's physical activity. Yet, the COVID-19 shelter-in-place mandates bound many children to their available home spaces for learning, movement, and development. The exact effect this mandate had on children's physical activity may vary among families. Objective: To understand, from the perspective of parents, how the COVID-19 shelter-in-place mandates affected children's physical activity, while also considering families' socioeconomic status. Design: Open-ended survey. Setting: Online. Method: Data were collected from 321 parents living in the United States of America. Parents answered an open-ended prompt to describe their children's physical activity during COVID-19 shelter-in-place mandates. Following data collection, inductive and deductive content analysis examined patterns in the data. Results: Analyses indicated that shelter-in-place mandates restricted children's opportunities for physical activity. However, if families had access to outdoor spaces or equipment, they could encourage and support more physical activity opportunities than those without. Families in the lower-income bracket had less access to outdoor space and subsequently those children had fewer opportunities to be physically active. Parents supported their children's physical activity through their involvement and encouragement. Conclusion: These findings underscore the importance of access to outdoor spaces and equipment for increasing children's physical activity. Findings can be used by educators and policymakers to equitably support families of lower socioeconomic status who reported less access to outdoor spaces.","Perez, Deanna; Thalken, Janelle K; Ughelu, Nzubechukwu E; Knight, Camilla J; Massey, William V",Front Public Health,,52

This this study aimed to investigate the influence of RAS blockers on the risk and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study analyzing nationwide claims data of 215,184 adults who underwent SARS-CoV-2 tests in South Korea. The SARS-CoV-2 positive rates and clinical outcomes were evaluated according to the use of RAS blockers in patients with hypertension (n=64,243). Results: In total, 38,919 patients with hypertension were on RAS blockers. The SARS-CoV-2 positive rates were significantly higher in the RAS blocker group than in the control group after adjustments (adjusted odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] = 1.22 [1.10-1.36], P<0.001), and matching by propensity score (adjusted OR [95% CI]= 1.16 [1.03-1.32], P=0.017). Among the 1,609 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients with hypertension, the use of RAS blockers was not associated with poor outcomes, such as mortality (adjusted OR [95% CI]=0.81 [0.56-1.17], P=0.265), and a composite of admission to the intensive care unit and mortality (adjusted OR [95% CI]=0.95 [0.73-1.22], P=0.669). Analysis in the propensity score-matched population showed consistent results. Conclusion: In this Korean nationwide claims dataset, the use of RAS blockers was associated with a higher risk to SARS-CoV-2 infection but not with higher mortality or other severe clinical courses.","Lee, Jinwoo; Jo, Seong Jin; Cho, Youngjin; Lee, Ji Hyun; Oh, Il-Young; Park, Jin Joo; Cho, Young-Seok; Choi, Dong-Ju",Korean j. intern. med.,,52

420946,"CRISPR Gene Therapy: Applications, Limitations, and Implications for the Future",2020,"PURPOSE: We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. METHODS: We identified close contacts of confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in northeast Chongqing, China, who were confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-positive (RT-PCR+). We stratified this cohort by normal vs abnormal findings on chest computed tomography (CT) and compared the strata regarding comorbidities, demographics, laboratory findings, viral transmission and other factors. RESULTS: Between January 2020 and March 2020, we identified and hospitalized 279 RT-PCR+ contacts of COVID-19 patients. 63 (23%) remained asymptomatic until discharge; 29 had abnormal and 34 had normal chest CT findings. The mean cohort age was 39.3 years, and 87.3% had no comorbidities. Mean time to diagnosis after close contact with a COVID-19 index patient was 16.0 days, and it was 13.4 days and 18.7 days for those with abnormal and normal CT findings, respectively (P < .05). Nine patients (14.3%) transmitted the virus to others; 4 and 5 were in the abnormal and normal CT strata, respectively. The median length of time for nucleic acid to turn negative was 13 days compared with 10.4 days in those with normal chest CT scans (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: A portion of asymptomatic individuals were capable of transmitting the virus to others. Given the frequency and potential infectiousness of asymptomatic infections, testing of traced contacts is essential.

423141,"Evaluation of polyhexamethylene guanidine-induced lung injuries by chest CT, pathologic examination, and RNA sequencing in a rat model",2021,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the post-contact risk of nurses who provide care for patients diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS: This investigation employed a quantitative-descriptive design. The study sample was comprised of the frontline nurses in the COVID-19 center hospitals in the northern part of Saudi Arabia. Snowball sampling was used, resulting in 80 frontline nurses. A survey using a self-administered questionnaire in a Google form was employed to collect the data, which was collected from May 20 through June 25, 2020. RESULTS: Some of the study participants were reported to have a history of both staying in the same household with each other (35%) and of traveling with a confirmed COVID-19 patient (20%). These participants were considered as community exposed to COVID-19. There were 8.8% who were classified as high risk due to failure in removing and replacing personal protective equipment (PPE); 6.3% were at high risk for not performing hand hygiene before and after touching COVID-19 patients, and 5% did not follow the recommended guidelines in performing hand hygiene after touching the patients' surroundings. In addition, 3.8% of the participants had an accident related to biological material, such as with splashes of biological fluid (in the eyes). These nurses were classified as high risk for COVID-19 virus infection, CONCLUSION: This study identifies practices that need improvement in combatting this virus. Since policies and guidelines may not always be optimal in all settings, a tailor-fitted guideline is appropriate. Nurse leaders, for example, need to establish an infection control system that provides real-time monitoring and facilitates immediate correction for nurses. Doing so will provide the nurses with a continuous awareness of predisposing themselves to acquiring the virus.","Albaqawi, Hamdan Mohammad; Pasay-An, Eddieson; Mostoles, Romeo; Villareal, Sandro",Appl Nurs Res,,52

425627,An Updated Review on Betacoronavirus Viral Entry Inhibitors: Learning from Past Discoveries to Advance COVID-19 Drug Discovery,2021,"The biological utilization of dissolved silicon (DSi) influences ocean ecology and biogeochemistry. In the deep sea, hexactinellid sponges are major DSi consumers that remain poorly understood. Their DSi consumption departs from the Michaelis-Menten kinetics of shallow-water demosponges and appears particularly maladapted to incorporating DSi from the modest concentrations typical of the modern ocean. Why did sponges not adapt to the shrinking DSi availability that followed diatom expansion some 100 to 65 million years ago? We propose that sponges incorporate DSi combining passive (aquaglyceroporins) and active (ArsB) transporters, while only active transporters (SITs) operate in diatoms and choanoflagellates. Evolution of greater silicon transport efficiency appears constrained by the additional role of aquaglyceroporins in transporting essential metalloids other than silicon. We discuss the possibility that lower energy costs may have driven replacement of ancestral SITs by less efficient aquaglyceroporins, and discuss the functional implications of conservation of aquaglyceroporin-mediated DSi utilization in vertebrates.","Maldonado, M; López-Acosta, M; Beazley, L; Kenchington, E; Koutsouveli, V; Riesgo, A",Sci.

426670,The Amyloid-beta rich CNS environment alters myeloid cell functionality independent of their origin,2020,"Viral proteases are highly specific and recognize conserved cleavage site sequences of â¼6-8 amino acids. Short stretches of homologous host-pathogen sequences (SSHHPS) can be found spanning the viral protease cleavage sites. We hypothesized that these sequences corresponded to specific host protein targets since >40 host proteins have been shown to be cleaved by Group IV viral proteases and one Group VI viral protease. Using PHI-BLAST and the viral protease cleavage site sequences, we searched the human proteome for host targets and analyzed the hit results. Although the polyprotein and host proteins related to the suppression of the innate immune responses may be the primary targets of these viral proteases, we identified other cleavable host proteins. These proteins appear to be related to the virus-induced phenotype associated with Group IV viruses, suggesting that information about viral pathogenesis may be extractable directly from the viral genome sequence. Here we identify sequences cleaved by the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro) in vitro within human MYH7 and MYH6 (two cardiac myosins linked to several cardiomyopathies), FOXP3 (an X-linked Treg cell transcription factor), ErbB4 (HER4), and vitamin-K-dependent plasma protein S (PROS1), an anticoagulation protein that prevents blood clots. Zinc inhibited the cleavage of these host sequences in vitro. Other patterns emerged from multispecies sequence alignments of the cleavage sites, which may have implications for the selection of animal models and zoonosis. SSHHPS/nsP is an example of a sequence-specific post-translational silencing mechanism.","Reynolds, Nathanael D; Aceves, Nathalie M; Liu, Jinny L; Compton, Jaimee R; Leary, Dagmar H; Freitas, Brendan T; Pegan, Scott D; Doctor, Katarina Z; Wu, Fred Y; Hu, Xin; Legler, Patricia M",ACS Infect Dis,,52
427221,Speed and strength of an epidemic intervention,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has seen worsened mental health as a result of lockdowns, isolation and changes to sociocultural functioning. The postponement of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics is representative of global cancellations of sporting events, reduced facility access and support restrictions that have affected both current and former athlete's psychological wellbeing. This study aimed to determine whether current (n = 93) and former (n = 111) athletes experienced worsened body image, relationship with food or eating disorder symptomatology during acute COVID-19 transitions. METHODS: The study was a Convergent Mixed Methods design whereby qualitative content analysis was collected and analysed simultaneously with quantitative cross-sectional data using the EAT-26 and self-report COVID-19 questions. Data were collected from April until May 2020 to capture data pertaining to transitions related to the pandemic and included individuals across 41 different individual and team sports from club to international competition levels. RESULTS: There was a surge in disordered eating in current and former athletes as a result of the early COVID-19 response. Eating disorders were suggested to occur in 21.1% of participants (18% current athletes n = 17, 25% former athletes (n = 26). There was a significant difference between males and females (p = 0.018, r = 0.17), but interestingly no differences between groups from individual vs team sports, type of sporting category (endurance, antigravitational, ball sport, power, technical and aesthetic) or level of competition (club, state, national or international). 34.8% (n = 69) self-reported worsened body image and 32.8% (n = 65) self-reported a worsened food relationship directly from COVID-19. Qualitative analysis indicated that disordered eating occurred predominantly in the form of body preoccupation, inhibitory food control, fear of body composition changes and binge eating. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that transitions in COVID-19 have worsened food-body relationships in current and former athletes and must be treated as an at-risk time for eating disorder development. We suggest that resources are allocated appropriately to assist athletes to foster psychologically positive food and body relationships through COVID-19 transitions. This study makes practice suggestions in supporting athletes to manage control, seek support, adapt and accept change and promote connection and variety through athletic transitions.","Buckley, G.

428814,Nanotechnology advances in pathogen- and host-targeted antiviral delivery: multipronged therapeutic intervention for pandemic control,2021,"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic, with its resultant social distancing, has disrupted the delivery of healthcare for both patients and providers. Fortunately, changes to legislation and regulation in response to the pandemic allowed Emory Healthcare to rapidly implement telehealth care. Beginning in early March 2020 and continuing through the initial 2-month implementation period (when data collection stopped), clinicians received telehealth training and certification. Standard workflows created by means of a hub-and-spoke operational model enabled rapid sharing and deployment of best practices throughout the system's physician group practice. Lean process huddles facilitated successful implementation. In total, 2,374 healthcare professionals, including 986 attending physicians, 416 residents and fellows, and 555 advanced practice providers, were trained and certified for telehealth; 53,751 new- and established-patient audio-video telehealth visits and 10,539 established-patient telephone visits were performed in 8 weeks for a total of 64,290 virtual visits. This initiative included a new COVID-19 virtual patient clinic that saw 705 patients in a 6-week period. A total of $14,662,967 was charged during this time; collection rates were similar to in-person visits. Initial patient satisfaction scores were equivalent to in-person visits. We conclude that rapid deployment of virtual visits can be accomplished through a structured, organized approach including training, certification, and Lean principles. A hub-and-spoke model enables bidirectional feedback and timely improvements, thus facilitating swifter implementation and a quick rise in patient volume. Financial sustainability is achievable, but to sustain that, telehealth requires the support of continued deregulation by legislative and regulatory bodies.","Esper, Gregory J; Sweeney, Robert L; Winchell, Emmeline; Duffell, J Michael; Kier, Sarah C; Lukens, Hallie W; Krupinski, Elizabeth A",J Healthc Manag,,52

Though acute respiratory coronavirus (SARS-COV2) that leads to COVID-19 infects people of all ages, severe symptoms and mortality occur disproportionately in older adults. Geroscience interventions that target biological aging could decrease risk across multiple age-related diseases and improve outcomes in response to infectious disease. This offers hope for a new host-directed therapeutic approach that could (i) improve outcomes following exposure or shorten treatment regimens; (ii) reduce the chronic pathology associated with the infectious disease and subsequent comorbidity, frailty, and disability; and (iii) promote development of immunological memory that protects against relapse or improves response to vaccination. We review the possibility of this approach by examining available evidence in metformin: a generic drug with a proven safety record that will be used in a large-scale multicenter clinical trial. Though rigorous translational research and clinical trials are needed to test this empirically, metformin may improve host immune defenses and confer protection against long-term health consequences of infectious disease, age-related chronic diseases, and geriatric syndromes.","Justice, Jamie N; Gubbi, Sriram; Kulkarni, Ameya S; Bartley, Jenna M; Kuchel, George A; Barzilai, Nir",Geroscience,,52
434742,Preliminary Data Related to the Effect of Climacostol Produced by the Freshwater Ciliate Climacostomum virens on Human Adenovirus,2020,"The dissemination of fake news significantly affects personal reputation and public trust. Recently, fake news detection has attracted tremendous attention, and previous studies mainly focused on finding clues from news content or diffusion path. However, the required features of previous models are often unavailable or insufficient in early detection scenarios, resulting in poor performance. Thus, early fake news detection remains a tough challenge. Intuitively, the news from trusted and authoritative sources or shared by many users with a good reputation is more reliable than other news. Using the credibility of publishers and users as prior weakly supervised information, we can quickly locate fake news in massive news and detect them in the early stages of dissemination. In this paper, we propose a novel Structure-aware Multi-head Attention Network (SMAN), which combines the news content, publishing, and reposting relations of publishers and users, to jointly optimize the fake news detection and credibility prediction tasks. In this way, we can explicitly exploit the credibility of publishers and users for early fake news detection. We conducted experiments on three real-world datasets, and the results show that SMAN can detect fake news in 4 hours with an accuracy of over 91%, which is much faster than the state-of-the-art models.","Yuan, Chunyuan; Ma, Qianwen; Zhou, Wei; Han, Jizhong; Hu, Songlin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04233v2.pdf,52

The new cationic surfactant DHBI-Br was successfully synthesized and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and elemental analysis and was further employed for DHBI-TPB ion-pair preparation. The sensor gave excellent response characteristics for CTAB, CPC and Hyamine with a Nernstian slope (57.1 to 59.1 mV/decade) whereas the lowest limit of detection (LOD) value was measured for CTAB (0.3 × 10-6 M). The sensor exhibited a fast dynamic response to dodecyl sulfate (DDS) and TPB. High sensor performances stayed intact regardless of the employment of inorganic and organic cations and in a broad pH range (2-11). Titration of cationic and etoxylated (EO)-nonionic surfactant (NSs) (in Ba2+) mixtures with TPB revealed the first inflexion point for a cationic surfactant and the second for an EO-nonionic surfactant. The increased concentration of EO-nonionic surfactants and the number of EO groups had a negative influence on titration curves and signal change. The sensor was successfully applied for the quantification of technical-grade cationic surfactants and in 12 personal care products and disinfectants. The results showed good agreement with the measurements obtained by a commercial surfactant sensor and by a two-phase titration. A good recovery for the standard addition method (98-102%) was observed.","Sakac, Nikola; Markovic, Dean; Sarkanj, Bojan; Madunic-Cacic, Dubravka; Hajdek, Krunoslav; Smoljan, Bozo; Jozanovic, Marija",Molecules (Basel),,52
435523,Thermoregulation of Biofilm Formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,2020,"BACKGROUND: Over half of adolescents are sexually active by age 18 years and represent half of sexually transmitted infections (STI). These individuals often do not obtain routine medical care, so discussing contraception at each visit becomes imperative. Our study objectives were to determine the frequency of visits before contraception was discussed/initiated, and to assess factors affecting primary care contraception provision. METHODS: A retrospective chart review (January 2009-June 2019) was conducted for preventive, follow-up, and sick visits; Title X confidential visits were excluded. Questions were asked about method at start and end of the visit. Nonparametric median tests for continuous variables and chi-squared tests for categorical variables assessed for differences for patient age, race, gender, insurance type, visit type, and provider gender. The institutional review board approved the study as exempt. RESULTS: Patients (n = 12,619; median = 15 years; 58% female) were seen in primary care clinic. Providers asked about contraception for 82% of visits, and averaged 3 visits before contraception was discussed. For patients asked about contraception, 60% were using a contraceptive method, 15% left the visit on a new method (24.9% long-acting reversible contraception [LARC]). For patients not using contraception, 39.9% left the visit on a method. Patients asked about contraception were female, older, Hispanic, had public insurance, and were seen by female providers (P < .001). Follow-up/sick visits represented <20% of patients asked about contraception. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple visits occur before contraception is discussed in adolescent primary care, and factors including age, race, and gender affect these discussions. Strategies to increase contraception discussions at all visits is essential, as adolescents do not always present for yearly visits.","Woods, Jennifer Leigh; Sheeder, Jeanelle L",J. pediatr. adolesc. gynecol,,52

This pandemic situation and magnitude of suffering has led to global effort to find out effective measures for discovery of new specific drugs and vaccines to combat this deadly disease. In addition to many initiatives to develop vaccines for protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2, some of which are at various stages of clinical trials researchers worldwide are currently using available conventional therapeutic drugs with potential to combat the disease effectively in other viral infections and it is believed that these antiviral drugs could act as a promising immediate alternative. Remdesivir (RDV), a broad-spectrum anti-viral agent, initially developed for the treatment of Ebola virus (EBOV) and known to show promising efficiency in in vitro and in vivo studies against SARS and MERS coronaviruses, is now being investigated against SARS-CoV-2. On May 1, 2020, The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for RDV to treat COVID-19 patients [2]. A number of multicentre clinical trials are on-going to check the safety and efficacy of RDV for the treatment of COVID-19. Results of published double blind, and placebo-controlled trial on RDV against SARS-CoV-2, showed that RDV administration led to faster clinical improvement in severe COVID-19 patients compared to placebo.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study to summarize the clinical practices of nonsevere patients with COVID-19 receiving the standard care, LPV/r or chloroquine in Beijing Ditan Hospital from January 20 to March 26, 2020. The main outcome measurements include the changes of cycle threshold values of open reading frame 1 ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid (N) genes by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay from day 1 to 7 after admission for patients receiving standard care or after treatment being initiated for patients receiving either LPV/r or chloroquine. The proportion of developing severe illness, fever duration and the time from symptom onset to chest computer tomography improvement, and negative conversion of nucleic acid were compared. RESULTS: Of the 129 patients included in the study, 59 received the standard care, 51 received LPV/r, and 19 received chloroquine. The demographics and baseline characteristics were comparable among the 3 groups. The median duration of fever, median time from symptom onset to chest computer tomography improvement, and negative conversion of the nucleic acid were similar among the 3 groups. The median increase in cycle threshold values of N and ORF1ab gene for patients receiving LPV/r or chloroquine or the standard care during the treatment course was 7.0 and 8.5, 8.0, and 7.6, 5.0, and 4.0, respectively. These figures were not found significantly different among the 3 groups.

449375,Detailed head localization and incidence of skin cancers,2021,"The severity of COVID-19 varies dramatically, ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe respiratory failure and death. Currently, few prognostic markers for disease outcomes exist, impairing patient triaging and treatment. Here, we train feed-forward neural networks on electronic health records of 819 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive patients admitted to a two-site NHS Trust hospital in London, England. To allow early risk assessment, the models ingest data collected in the emergency department (ED) to predict subsequent admission to intensive care, need for mechanical ventilation and in-hospital mortality. We apply univariate selection and recursive feature elimination to find the minimal subset of clinical variables needed for accurate prediction. Our models achieve AUC-ROC scores of 0.78 to 0.87, outperforming standard clinical risk scores. This accuracy is reached with as few as 13% of clinical variables routinely collected within the ED, which increases the practical applicability of such algorithms. Hence, state-of-the-art neural networks can predict severe COVID-19 accurately and early from a small subset of clinical variables. © 2021, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","Peacock, S.; Cinelli, M.; Heldt, F.

However, performance concerns have emerged recently, notably regarding sensitivity. We hypothesized that the clinical, biological, and radiological characteristics of patients with a false-negative first RT-PCR test and a final diagnosis of COVID-19 might differ from those of patients with a positive first RT-PCR test. We conducted a multicenter matched case-control study in COVID-19 patients. Patients with a negative first RT-PCR test were matched to patients with a positive first RT-PCR test on age, sex, and initial admission unit (ward or intensive care). We included 80 cases and 80 controls between March 30, and June 22, 2020. Neither mortality at hospital discharge nor hospital stay length differed between the two groups (P = 0.80 and P = 0.54, respectively). By multivariate analysis, two factors were independently associated with a lower risk of a first false-negative test, namely, headache (adjusted OR [aOR], 0.07; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.01-0.49]; P = 0.007) and fatigue/malaise (aOR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.03-0.81; P = 0.027); two other factors were independently associated with a higher risk of a first false-negative test, namely, platelets > 207·103 mm-3 (aOR, 3.81; 95% CI, 1.10-13.16]; P = 0.034) and C-reactive protein > 79.8 mg·L-1 (aOR, 4.00; 95% CI, 1.21-13.19; P = 0.023).

Although certain medications suggested for other afflictions tend to be potentially effective for curing the infection, there is no approved vaccination or drug available for this virus yet. Comprehension of the disease molecular pathogenesis could provide useful tools for COVID-19 patients in surveillance, prognosis, treatment, vaccine development and therapeutic targeting. The present research aims to summarize the association in COVID-19 patients between molecular dimensions of comorbidities with clinical and preclinical information. Developing an ACE2 inhibitor could be a possible therapeutic target. Plasmin is another possible candidate both in diagnosis and treatment areas.

456431,COVID19 Approved Drug Repurposing: Pocket Similarity Approach,2020,"BACKGROUND: With multiple COVID-19 vaccines available, understanding the epidemiologic, clinical, and economic value of increasing coverage levels and expediting vaccination is important. METHODS: We developed a computational model (transmission and age-stratified clinical and economics outcome model) representing the US population, COVID-19 coronavirus spread (02/2020-12/2022), and vaccination to determine the impact of increasing coverage and expediting time to achieve coverage. RESULTS: When achieving a given vaccination coverage in 270 days (70% vaccine efficacy), every 1% increase in coverage can avert an average of 876,800 (217,000-2,398,000) cases, varying with the number of people already vaccinated. For example, each 1% increase between 40%-50% coverage can prevent 1.5million cases, 56,240 hospitalizations, 6,660 deaths, gain 77,590 QALYs, save $602.8 million in direct medical costs and $1.3 billion in productivity losses . Expediting to 180 days could save an additional 5.8 million cases, 215,790 hospitalizations, 26,370 deaths, 206,520 QALYs, $3.5 billion in direct medical costs, and $4.3 billion in productivity losses. CONCLUSION: Our study quantifies the potential value of decreasing vaccine hesitancy and increasing vaccination coverage and how this value may decrease with time it takes to achieve coverage, emphasizing the need to reach high coverage levels as soon as possible, especially before the Fall/Winter.","Bartsch, Sarah M; Wedlock, Patrick T; O039,; Shea, Kelly J; Cox, Sarah N; Strych, Ulrich; Nuzzo, Jennifer B; Ferguson, Marie C; Bottazzi, Maria Elena; Siegmund, Sheryl S; Hotez, Peter J; Lee, Bruce Y",J. infect. dis,,52

So far, the absence of a vaccine against the new coronavirus has led people worldwide to seek various therapeutic alternatives, including use of cholecalciferol. DESIGN AND SETTING: Narrative review developed by a research group at a public university in Recife (PE), Brazil. METHODS: We searched the literature on the use of cholecalciferol for prevention or treatment of COVID-19, using the MEDLINE and LILACS databases, with the keywords ""vitamin D"", ""cholecalciferol"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""COVID-19"" and ""coronavirus"", from January 1, 2020, to June 10, 2020. Narrative reviews, cohort studies and ecological studies were selected. RESULTS: We retrieved 32 references, of which 8 were considered eligible for intensive review and critical analysis. These comprised five narrative reviews, two observational studies and one protocol proposal. Most of the studies selected reported positive effects from use of vitamin D for prevention or treatment of COVID-19. However, there was little quantitative data to assess the real impact of using this vitamin as an intervention against this disease. CONCLUSIONS: Current studies on vitamin D used for purposes other than bone health promotion cannot be taken as support to justify its use in a disease as recent as COVID-19. Studies of greater robustness, with higher levels of clinical evidence, need to be conducted. Rational use of this vitamin needs to be ensured, thereby minimizing the impacts on the patient and the public healthcare system.","Chagas, Stephanye Carolyne Christino; Moreira, Francisca Sueli Monte; Barbosa, Irla Carla França; Leal Júnior, Osvaldo de Sousa; Leal, Leila Bastos; Santana, Davi Pereira de",Sao Paulo med. j,,52

Because dietary habits are one of the most important modifiable risk factors for inflammation, identification of dietary components associated with inflammation could play a significant role in controlling or reducing the risk of COVID-19. We investigated the inflammatory potential of diets consumed by African American (AA) and Caucasian American (CA) women of childbearing age (n = 509) who are at high risk for exposure to COVID-19 by being residents of Birmingham, Alabama, a city severely affected by this pandemic. The overall pro- and anti- inflammatory scores were calculated using dietary intake data gathered using Block food frequency questionnaire. The proinflammatory potential of diets consumed by AAs was significantly higher compared to CAs. Several anti- and proinflammatory nutrients and food groups consumed differed by race. With consumption of a greater number of antioxidants and B-vitamins, CAs switched toward an anti-inflammatory score more effectively than AAs while AAs performed better than CAs in improving the anti-inflammatory score with the consumption of a greater number of minerals and vitamin D. Effective race-specific dietary modifications or supplementation with nutrients identified will be useful to improve proinflammatory diets toward anti-inflammatory. This approach could aid in controlling the current COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics of a similar nature in women at risk for exposure.","Piyathilake, Chandrika J; Badiga, Suguna; Chappell, Ashley R; Johanning, Gary L; Jolly, Pauline E",Nutr Res,,52

Weighing the effects of viruses and lockdowns on children,2021,"OBJECTIVE: New treatments in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been developed to improve patient outcomes, raise their quality of life, and reduce joint damage, but long-term responses and remission remain low. This study aimed to analyse the Spanish prescribing patterns and the effectiveness of biological (b) disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) available for RA in clinical practice. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An observational retrospective study was performed in a teaching hospital, analysing the different combinations of drugs prescribed, real-life effectiveness and reasons for withdrawal. RESULTS: In total, 210 patients were included, with 19 different patterns (pharmacological groups alone or in combination) of treatment prescribed. Most patients started their treatment with a conventional synthetic (cs) DMARD alone or in combination with a glucocorticosteroid. Among the initial patterns, treatment with only one csDMARD showed a longer duration. The time to first bDMARD was 6 years. TNF-&#945; inhibitors are the most commonly prescribed drugs as initial biological treatments. The highest percentages of good responses and remissions were achieved with tocilizumab, etanercept and infliximab. The time to remission was also lower with tocilizumab. Lack of response, adverse effects and remission were the main causes of bDMARD withdrawal. The duration of treatments until withdrawal was similar among bDMARDs, except for rituximab, for which the duration was slightly shorter. CONCLUSIONS: Prescribing pattern analysis showed the highest responses and remission rates with tocilizumab and TNF-&#945; inhibitors. The main reasons for withdrawal were lack of response and adverse effects. Further research is needed to improve pharmacological RA management in real-life settings.","Martinez-Múgica, C; Manso, G",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,52

METHODS: We used positive cohort of 97 samples from Covid-19 patients or healthcare workers, collected at late time points from symptom onsets. We also included another cohort of 215 samples as negative controls, 78 of which had positive serology test results of other infectious diseases or autoimmunity. Assay specificity was assessed by using a total of 847 anonymized samples which were collected before the Covid-19 pandemic from local patient populations seeking clinical care for rheumatoid diseases, thyroid cancer, and therapeutic drug monitoring. RESULTS: Abbott IgG, Euroimmun IgG/IgA had high precision, demonstrated by both intra- and inter-day CVs of <2%. There was no Abbott or Euroimmun IgG assay cross reactivity in the 78 samples with positive serology of non-SARS-CoV-2 infectious diseases and positive autoimmune antibodies. The Abbott IgG has specificity of 99.6%, while Euroimmun IgG and IgA were as high as 91.5% and 71.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our evaluation confirmed high specificity of the Abbott IgG assay, while it was lower for Euroimmun IgG. Euroimmun IgA has suboptimal specificity which may limit its clinical use.

Their therapeutic management is still challenging: among therapeutic options, lidocaine patch 5% was rarely used in acute neuralgia on lesional skin, and its efficacy to prevent PHN was never studied. The efficacy and tolerability of lidocaine patch 5% was evaluated in 38 patients with acute neuralgia (19) and PHN (19). Pain intensity was investigated using DN4 questionnaire and NRS-11 scale at baseline and at week 2, 4, and 8. The use of rescue therapy was also evaluated. A significant reduction of DN4 and NRS-11 was observed already at W2, with further improvement at W4 and W8. A complete response to treatment (DN4 and NRS-11 = 0) at week 8 was higher in patients with acute neuralgia (63.2%) than PHN (31.6%). Rescue therapy gradually decreased in acute neuralgia patients from week 2 (57.9%) to week 8 (10.5%), with only two patients needing neuroleptics. In PHN patients rescue therapy remained stable (68.4%). According to our results, lidocaine patch 5% applied on lesional skin was well tolerated and ensured a rapid pain relief in acute neuralgia; if early used, it prevented PHN in almost all patients.","Bianchi, Leonardo; Piergiovanni, Chiara; Marietti, Rossella; Renzini, Massimo; Gori, Fabio; Hansel, Katharina; Tramontana, Marta; Stingeni, Luca",Dermatol Ther,,52

An understanding of the spatiotemporal patterns and influencing factors of the COVID-19 epidemic on multiple scales could benefit the control of the outbreak. Therefore, we used spatial autocorrelation and Spearman's rank correlation methods to investigate these two topics, respectively. The COVID-19 epidemic data reported publicly and relevant open data in Hubei province were analyzed. The results showed that (1) at both prefecture and county levels, the global spatial autocorrelation was extremely significant for the cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases (CCC) in Hubei province from 30 January to 18 February 2020. Further, (2) at both levels, the significant hotspots and cluster/outlier areas were observed solely in Wuhan city and most of its districts/sub-cities from 30 January to 18 February 2020. (3) At the prefecture level in Hubei province, the number of CCC had a positive and extremely significant correlation (p < 0.01) with the registered population (RGP), resident population (RSP), Baidu migration index (BMI), regional gross domestic production (GDP), and total retail sales of consumer goods (TRS), respectively, from 29 January to 18 February 2020 and had a negative and significant correlation (p < 0.05) with minimum elevation (MINE) from 2 February to 18 February 2020, but no association with the land area (LA), population density (PD), maximum elevation (MAXE), mean elevation (MNE), and range of elevation (RAE) from 23 January to 18 February 2020. (4) At the county level, the number of CCC in Hubei province had a positive and extremely significant correlation (p < 0.01) with PD, RGP, RSP, GDP, and TRS, respectively, from 27 January to 18 February 2020, and was negatively associated with MINE, MAXE, MNE, and RAE, respectively, from 26 January to 18 February 2020, and negatively associated with LA from 30 January to 18 February 2020. It suggested that (1) the COVID-19 epidemics at both levels in Hubei province had evident characteristics of significant global spatial autocorrelations and significant centralized high-risk outbreaks. (2) The COVID-19 epidemics were significantly associated with the natural factors, such as LA, MAXE, MNE, and RAE, -only at the county level, not at the prefecture level, from 2 February to 18 February 2020. (3) The COVID-19 epidemics were significantly related to the socioeconomic factors, such as RGP, RSP, TRS, and GDP, at both levels from 26 January to 18 February 2020.

Yet, the theoretical and practical perspectives on STEAM, from its nature to classroom applications and its implementation in teacher education have unexamined potential. This special issue grew out of the International LUMAT Research Symposium “Promoting STEAM in Education” that took place at the University of Helsinki, Finland in June of 2020. With the challenges of organizing an online symposium in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, its online nature had significant advantages. The symposium drew international scholars inviting a multitude of prospective on STEAM education, while uncovering the challenges faced by educators. The issue aims at examining these challenges through a collection of papers. In this editorial, we introduce some key notions, discourses, and challenges of STEAM education, as a relatively novel concept and briefly discuss the history of STEAM and its evolution over the last decades. We also problematize STEAM and its roots through asking a question: What is “A” in STEAM representing?

467395,"Technological approaches to streamline vaccination schedules, progressing towards single-dose vaccines",2020,"BACKGROUND: Cancer-incidence and mortality-trend analyses require appropriate statistical modelling. In countries without a nationwide cancer registry, an additional issue is estimating national incidence from local-registry data. The objectives of this study were to (i) promote the use of multidimensional penalized splines (MPS) for trend analyses; (ii) estimate the national cancer-incidence trends, using MPS, from only local-registry data; and (iii) propose a validation process of these estimates. METHODS: We used an MPS model of age and year for trend analyses in France over 1990-2015 with a projection up to 2018. Validation was performed for 22 cancer sites and relied essentially on comparison with reference estimates that used the incidence/health-care ratio over the period 2011-2015. Alternative estimates that used the incidence/mortality ratio were also used to validate the trends. RESULTS: In the validation assessment, the relative differences of the incidence estimates (2011-2015) with the reference estimates were <5% except for testis cancer in men and < 7% except for larynx cancer in women. Trends could be correctly derived since 1990 despite incomplete histories in some registries. The proposed method was applied to estimate the incidence and mortality trends of female lung cancer and prostate cancer in France. CONCLUSIONS: The validation process confirmed the validity of the national French estimates; it may be applied in other countries to help in choosing the most appropriate national estimation method according to country-specific contexts. MPS form a powerful statistical tool for trend analyses; they allow trends to vary smoothly with age and are suitable for modelling simple as well as complex trends thanks to penalization. Detailed trend analyses of lung and prostate cancers illustrated the suitability of MPS and the epidemiological interest of such analyses.","Uhry, Zoé; Chatignoux, Edouard; Dantony, Emmanuelle; Colonna, Marc; Roche, Laurent; Fauvernier, Mathieu; Defossez, Gautier; Leguyader-Peyrou, Sandra; Monnereau, Alain; Grosclaude, Pascale; Bossard, Nadine; Remontet, Laurent",Int. j. epidemiol,,52
468902,NAMS webserver: coding potential assessment and functional annotation of plant transcripts,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel betacoronavirus that has caused the global health crisis known as COVID-19. The implications of mitochondrial dysfunction with COVID-19 are discussed as well as deregulated mitochondria and inter-organelle functions as a posited comorbidity enhancing detrimental outcomes. Many environmental chemicals (ECs) and endocrine-disrupting chemicals can do damage to mitochondria and cause mitochondrial dysfunction. During infection, SARS-CoV-2 via its binding target ACE2 and TMPRSS2 can disrupt mitochondrial function. Viral genomic RNA and structural proteins may also affect the normal function of the mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi apparatus. Drugs considered for treatment of COVID-19 should consider effects on organelles including mitochondria functions. Mitochondrial self-balance and clearance via mitophagy are important in SARS-CoV-2 infection, which indicate monitoring and protection of mitochondria against SARS-CoV-2 are important. Mitochondrial metabolomic analysis may provide new indicators of COVID-19 prognosis. A better understanding of the role of mitochondria during SARS-CoV-2 infection may help to improve intervention therapies and better protect mitochondrial disease patients from pathogens as well as people living with poor nutrition and elevated levels of socioeconomic stress and ECs.","Yao, Yunyi; Lawrence, David A",J Biochem Mol Toxicol,,52

Resveratrol, a well-known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory triphenolic stilbene, is abundant in red grapes, red wine, dark chocolate, and peanut butter. Alternatively, pterostilbene-zinc combination might be also considered without using a nano-carrier. We recommend conducting prompt clinical trials to assess the potential of the suggested combinations as a monotherapy for mild COVID-19 with a potential to prevent its progression to moderate-severe disease for which we recommend their trial as an adjuvant therapy. Furthermore, the suggested combinations might also possess a pharmacotherapeutic potential that exceeds COVID-19 to various inflammatory, immunologic, and oncologic diseases.","Kelleni, Mina T",Biomed Pharmacother,,52

This study investigated: (1) the prevalence of behavioral intention of COVID-19 vaccination (BICV) under eight scenarios combining vaccines' effectiveness/safety/cost, plus two general scenarios of free/self-paid vaccination given governmental/hospital recommendations, (2) perceptions involving preferred timing of COVID-19 vaccination and impacts of various attributes on BICV, and (3) factors of BICV based on the Health Belief Model. An anonymous online cross-sectional survey was conducted among 2,254 full-time doctors/nurses in three Chinese provinces during 10/2020-11/2020. The prevalence of BICV was 75.1%/68.0% among nurses/doctors under the most optimum scenario of this study (free/80% effectiveness/rare mild side effects); it dropped to 64.6%/56.5% if it costed 600 Yuan (USD90). Similar prevalence was obtained (72.7%/71.2%) if the vaccination was recommended by the government/hospitals but dropped to <50% if effectiveness was 50% or mild side effects were common; 13.0% preferred to take up COVID-19 vaccination at the soonest (81.8% would wait and see). Scientific proof (completion of phase III clinical trials and approval from health authorities) was rated the highest in its impacts on vaccination decision, followed by vaccines' performance, and then logistics. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that perceived severity, perceived barriers, cues to action, and self-efficacy (but neither perceived susceptibility nor perceived barriers) were significantly associated with the two BICV outcomes. The coverage of COVID-19 vaccination would be high only if the vaccines perform well. Health promotion may take the findings into account.","Yu, Yanqiu; Lau, Joseph T F; She, Rui; Chen, Xi; Li, Liping; Li, Lijuan; Chen, Xiaojun",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,52

We studied 126 healthy individuals aged 23-61 years. Insulin resistance (IR) was quantified by measuring steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) concentration during the insulin suppression test. Body mass index (BMI), adiposity, fasting insulin, glucose, leptin as well as structural neuroimaing with automatic hippocampal subfield segmentation were performed. Data analysis using unsupervised machine learning (k-means clustering) identified two subgroups reflecting a pattern of more pronounced hippocampal volume reduction being concurrently associated with greater adiposity and insulin resistance; the hippocampal volume reductions were uniform across subfields. Individuals in the most deviant subgroup were predominantly women (79 versus 42 %) with higher BMI [27.9 (2.5) versus 30.5 (4.6) kg/m2], IR (SSPG concentration, [156 (61) versus 123 (70) mg/dL] and leptinemia [21.7 (17.0) versus 44.5 (30.4) µg/L]. The use of person-based modeling in healthy individuals suggests that adiposity, insulin resistance and compromised structural hippocampal integrity behave as a composite phenotype; female sex emerged as risk factor for this phenotype.","Frangou, Sophia; Abbasi, Fahim; Watson, Katie; Haas, Shalaila S; Antoniades, Mathilde; Modabbernia, Amirhossein; Myoraku, Alison; Robakis, Thalia; Rasgon, Natalie",Neurosci. res,,52

METHODS: Retrospective observational study of 81 consecutive patients admitted with Covid-19 respiratory infection who underwent MDCT for clinical suspicion of PTE (sudden dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis, severe respiratory failure (SRF) not corrected with high O2 flow) and/or raised D-dimer. RESULTS: Of the 81 patients studied [64 (79.01%) men], acute PTE was identified in 22 (27.16%), bilaterally in 13 (59.09%), and 13 (59,09%) showed areas of hypoperfusion. Of the 59 (72.83%) patients without PTE, hypoperfusion was observed in 41 (69.49%) (attributable in one case to pulmonary emphysema). In 18 (22.2%) of the total number of patients, neither PTE nor hypoperfusion were seen. A crazy paving pattern is a risk factor for developing PTE (OR 1.94; 95% CI 0.28-13.57), as are consolidations (OR 1.44; 95% CI 0.24-8.48) and septal thickening/bronchiectasis (OR 1.47; 95% CI 0.12-17.81). Patients with O2-refractory SRF showed a 6.36-fold higher risk for hypoperfusion on the iodine map. CONCLUSION: By adding the functional image to the anatomical image, pulmonary angiography with MDCT and iodine mapping can demonstrate not only PTE in main, lobar and segmental arteries, but also the presence of hypoperfusion in distal vessels. This makes it a highly useful tool for the accurate diagnosis and therapeutic orientation of patients with Covid-19 lung involvement.","Pérez Dueñas, Virginia; Allona Krauel, María; Agrela Rojas, Emilio; Ramírez Prieto, Maria Teresa; Díez Izquierdo, Laura; López de la Guardia, Ulpiano; Torres Sánchez, Isabel",Arch. bronconeumol.

The National University Hospital (NUH) is Singapore's third largest hospital with 1200 beds, heavy clinical workloads, and major roles in research and teaching. MAIN BODY: With memories of SARS still vivid, there was an urgent requirement for the NUH Division of Infectious Diseases to adapt-undergoing major reorganization to face rapidly changing priorities while ensuring usual essential services and standards. Leveraging on individual strengths, our division mobilized to meet the demands of COVID-19 while engaging in high-level coordination, strategy, and advocacy. We present our experience of the 60 days since the nation's first case. During this time, our hospital has managed 3030 suspect cases, including 1300 inpatients, 37 confirmed cases, and overseen 4384 samples tested for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Complex hospital adaptations were supported by an unprecedented number of workflows and coordination channels essential to safe and effective operations. The actions we describe, aligned with international recommendations and emerging evidence-based best practices, may serve as a framework for other divisions and institutions facing the spread of COVID-19 globally.","Archuleta, Sophia; Cross, Gail; Somani, Jyoti; Lum, Lionel; Santosa, Amelia; Alagha, Rawan A; Allen, David M; Ang, Alicia; Beh, Darius; Chai, Louis; Chan, Si Min; Lim, See Ming; Olszyna, Dariusz P; Ong, Catherine; Oon, Jolene; Salada, Brenda M A; Smitasin, Nares; Sun, Louisa; Tambyah, Paul A; Tham, Sai Meng; Yan, Gabriel; Yee, Chen Hui; Dan, Yock Young; Jureen, Roland; Tee, Nancy; Mahadevan, Malcolm; Yau, Ying Wei; Quek, Swee Chye; Liu, Eugene H; Sin, Clara; Bagdasarian, Natasha; Fisher, Dale A",BMC Med,,52
485995,Stealth Fluorescence Labeling for Live Microscopy Imaging of mRNA Delivery,2021,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has spread across the globe with alarming speed, morbidity and mortality. Immediate triage of suspected patients with chest infections caused by COVID-19 using chest CT may be of assistance when results from definitive viral testing are delayed. Purpose To develop and validate an artificial intelligence (AI) system to score the likelihood and extent of pulmonary COVID-19 on chest CT scans using the CO-RADS and CT severity scoring systems. Materials and Methods CORADS-AI consists of three deep learning algorithms that automatically segment the five pulmonary lobes, assign a CO-RADS score for the suspicion of COVID-19 and assign a CT severity score for the degree of parenchymal involvement per lobe. This study retrospectively included patients who received an unenhanced chest CT scan due to clinical suspicion of COVID-19 at two medical centers. The system was trained, validated, and tested with data from one of the centers. Data from the second center served as an external test set. Diagnostic performance and agreement with scores assigned by eight independent observers were measured using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, linearly-weighted kappa and classification accuracy. Results 105 patients (62 ± 16 years, 61 men) and 262 patients (64 ± 16 years, 154 men) were evaluated in the internal and the external test set, respectively. The system discriminated between COVID-19 positive and negative patients with areas under the ROC curve of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.91-0.98) and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.84-0.93). Agreement with the eight human observers was moderate to substantial with a mean linearly-weighted kappa of 0.60 ± 0.01 for CO-RADS scores and 0.54 ± 0.01 for CT severity scores. Conclusion CORADS-AI correctly identified COVID-19 positive patients with high diagnostic performance from chest CT exams, assigned standardized CO-RADS and CT severity scores in good agreement with eight independent observers and generalized well to external data.","Lessmann, Nikolas; Sánchez, Clara I; Beenen, Ludo; Boulogne, Luuk H; Brink, Monique; Calli, Erdi; Charbonnier, Jean-Paul; Dofferhoff, Ton; van Everdingen, Wouter M; Gerke, Paul K; Geurts, Bram; Gietema, Hester A; Groeneveld, Miriam; van Harten, Louis; Hendrix, Nils; Hendrix, Ward; Huisman, Henkjan J; Isgum, Ivana; Jacobs, Colin; Kluge, Ruben; Kok, Michel; Krdzalic, Jasenko; Lassen-Schmidt, Bianca; van Leeuwen, Kicky; Meakin, James; Overkamp, Mike; van Rees Vellinga, Tjalco; van Rikxoort, Eva M; Samperna, Riccardo; Schaefer-Prokop, Cornelia; Schalekamp, Steven; Scholten, Ernst Th; Sital, Cheryl; Stöger, Lauran; Teuwen, Jonas; Vaidhya Venkadesh, Kiran; de Vente, Coen; Vermaat, Marieke; Xie, Weiyi; de Wilde, Bram; Prokop, Mathias; van Ginneken, Bram",Radiology,,52

Comorbidities such as COPD, diabetes, hypertension and malignancy predispose patients with Covid-19 to adverse clinical outcomes. Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disorder caused by pathological mutation(s) in the SERPINA1 gene resulting in an imbalance in proteinase activity which may lead to premature emphysema and COPD. Our aim was to investigate whether people with severe AAT deficiency (AATD) have an increased risk of (severe) COVID-19 infection. We collected data on COVID-19 symptoms, laboratory-confirmed infection, hospitalization and treatment by means of a telephone survey, directly administered to Italian severe AATD subjects in May 2020. We then compared our findings with data collected by the Istituto Superiore di Sanità on the total population in Italy during the same period. We found an higher frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection in our cohort (3.8%) compared to national data regarding infection, thus giving severe AATD a relative risk of 8. 8 (95%CI 5.1-20,0; p<0.0001) for symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, the relative risk (RR) was higher in AATD patients with pre-existing lung diseases (RR 13.9; 95%CI 8.0-33.6; p<0.001), but with a similar death rate (1 in 8, 12.5%) compared to the general population (13.9%; RR 0.9). These preliminary findings highlight the importance of close surveillance in the spread of COVID-19 in patients with severe AATD and underlines the need for further studies into the role of the antiprotease shield in preventing SARS-Cov-2 infection.","Ferrarotti, I; Ottaviani, S; Balderacchi, A M; Barzon, V; De Silvestri, A; Piloni, D; Mariani, F; Corsico, A G",Respir Med,,52

487592,Activatable Carbocyanine Dimers for Photoacoustic and Fluorescent Detection of Protease Activity,2021,"The sudden outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) has infected over 100 million people and led to over two million deaths (data in January 2021), posing a significant threat to global human health. As a potential carrier of the novel coronavirus, the exhaled airflow of infected individuals through coughs is significant in virus transmission. The research of detailed airflow characteristics and velocity distributions is insufficient because most previous studies utilize particle image velocimetry (PIV) with low frequency. This study measured the airflow velocity of human coughs in a chamber using PIV with high frequency (interval: 1/2986â¯s) to provide a detailed validation database for droplet propagation CFD simulation. Sixty cough cases for ten young healthy nonsmoking volunteers (five males and five females) were analyzed. Ensemble-average operations were conducted to eliminate individual variations. Vertical and horizontal velocity distributions were measured around the mouth area. Overall cough characteristics such as cough duration time (CDT), peak velocity time (PVT), maximum velocities, and cough spread angle were obtained. The CDT of the cough airflow was 520-560â¯mâ¯s, while PVT was 20â¯mâ¯s. The male/female averaged maximum velocities were 15.2/13.1â¯m/s. The average vertical/horizontal cough spread angle was 15.3°/13.3° for males and 15.6°/14.2° for females. In addition, the spatial and temporal distributions of ensemble-averaged velocity profiles were obtained in the vertical and horizontal directions. The experimental data can provide a detailed validation database the basis for further study on the influence of cough airflow on virus transmission using computational fluid dynamic simulations.","Han, Mengtao; Ooka, Ryozo; Kikumoto, Hideki; Oh, Wonseok; Bu, Yunchen; Hu, Shuyuan",Build Environ,,52

Strategies that combine NPIs with testing may improve efficacy and shorten quarantine durations. We develop a stochastic within-host model of SARS-CoV-2 that captures temporal changes in test sensitivities, incubation- and infectious periods. We use the model to simulate relative transmission risk for (i) isolation of symptomatic individuals, (ii) contact person management and (iii) quarantine of incoming travelers. We estimated that testing travelers at entry reduces transmission risks to 21.3% ([20.7, 23.9], PCR) and 27.9% ([27.1, 31.1], rapid diagnostic tests; RDT), compared to unrestricted entry. We calculated that 4 (PCR) vs. 5 (RDT) days pre-test quarantine are non-inferior to a 10 days quarantine for incoming travelers and that 8 (PCR) vs. 10 (RDT) days of pre-test quarantine are non-inferior to 14 days post-exposure quarantine.

Thus, this study assessed health department websites (N = 50) to determine if CWF content existed, the ease of finding it, and if it was written in plain language and for a consumer audience. We used the web component of the HLE2: The Health Literacy Environment of Hospitals and Health Centers (HLE2) to assess how easy or difficult it was to the navigate a website and find information. Forty-one websites had CWF information; 37 states had content written for a consumer audience. HLE2 scores ranged from 0 to 54 points (60 possible). Only five states had websites with a HLE2 score of 50 or higher. SHDs with higher HLE2 scores were easy to navigate and their content was written for a consumer audience. Study findings suggest most SHDs should improve their website's CWF content and its accessibility to better promote the role of fluoridated water in preventing dental caries.","Maybury, Catherine; Jacob, Matt; Flanders, Jessica M; Horowitz, Alice M",PLoS One,,52

494894,Molecular Mechanisms of Vascular Damage During Lung Injury,2021,"The spotted lanternfly Lycorma delicatula (White) is an invasive insect spreading throughout southeast Asia and eastern North America. The rapid spread of this species is facilitated by the prevalence of its preferred host, tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle), as well as its use of many other host plants. While the spotted lanternfly has been previously reported to use over 65 plant species, most of these reports are from Asia and may not be applicable in North America. Additionally, many of the known hosts have not been specified as feeding hosts or as egg laying substrates. To better understand the potential impacts of this invasive insect on natural and cultivated systems in North America, we reviewed records from published and unpublished results and observations of host plant use by spotted lanternfly. We aggregated 172 host plant records worldwide and found feeding behaviors associated with 103 plant taxa across 33 families and 17 orders, 20 of which were not previously known to be associated with SLF and 15 of which were not confirmed as feeding hosts. North American records account for 56 of these taxa which include native, cultivated, and nonnative species. As a result, the spotted lanternfly has the potential to impact a wide assortment of ecosystems throughout its potential range and its North American distribution may not be limited by the presence of tree of heaven.","Barringer, Lawrence; Ciafré, Claire M",Environ. entomol,,52

In total, 533 sexual minority and 1421 heterosexual participants were recruited through a Facebook advertisement. The constructs pertaining to cognition (perceived relative susceptibility to COVID-19, perceived COVID-19 severity, having sufficient knowledge and information on COVID-19, and confidence in coping with COVID-19), affect (worry toward COVID-19), and behavior (adoption of health-protective behaviors) in relation to health beliefs about COVID-19 were compared between sexual minority and heterosexual participants. The results indicated that sexual minority participants had lower perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, greater self-confidence in coping with COVID-19, and lower worry about COVID-19 and were less likely to maintain good indoor ventilation and disinfect their household than heterosexual individuals. Sexual orientation is the modifying factor for the Health Belief Model in the COVID-19 pandemic and should be taken into consideration when medical professionals establish prevention programs for COVID-19.","Ko, Nai-Ying; Lu, Wei-Hsin; Chen, Yi-Lung; Li, Dian-Jeng; Chang, Yu-Ping; Wang, Peng-Wei; Yen, Cheng-Fang",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,52

To clarify the role of inflammatory factors in COVID-19 vascular injury, we used a multiplex immunoassay to profile 65 inflammatory cytokines/chemokines/growth factors in plasma samples from 24 hospitalized (severe/critical) COVID-19 patients, 14 mild/moderate cases, and 13 healthy controls (HCs). COVID-19 patients had significantly higher plasma levels of 20 analytes than HCs. Surprisingly, only one cytokine (MIF) was among these altered analytes, while the rest were chemokines/growth factors. Additionally, only MMP-1 and VEGF-A were significantly elevated in hospitalized COVID-19 patients when compared to mild/moderate cases. We further studied MMP-1 enzymatic activity and multiple endothelial cell (EC) activation markers (soluble forms of CD146, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1) and found that they were highly dysregulated in COVID-19 patients. Thus, COVID-19 patients have a unique inflammatory profile, and excessive MMP-1 and hyperactivation of ECs are associated with the severity of COVID-19.","Syed, Fahim; Li, Wei; Relich, Ryan F; Russell, Patrick M; Zhang, Shanxiang; Zimmerman, Michelle K; Yu, Qigui",J. infect. dis,,52

Requiring abstinence for shelter engagement is impractical for many with severe alcohol use disorders and poses a modifiable barrier to self-isolation orders. Managed alcohol programs (MAPs) have successfully increased housing adherence for those with physical alcohol dependence in Canada, but to our knowledge, they have not been implemented in the United States. To avoid life-threatening alcohol withdrawal syndromes and to support adherence to COVID-19 self-isolation and quarantine orders, MAPs were piloted by the public health departments of San Francisco and Alameda counties. Development of MAPs: We describe implementation of a first-in-the-nation alcohol use disorder intervention of a MAP that emerged at three public health isolation settings within San Francisco and Alameda counties in California. All three interventions utilized a similar process to develop the protocol and implement the MAP that included identification of champions for system-level advocacy and engagement of stakeholders. Implementation of MAPs: We describe the creation and implementation of the distinct protocols. We provide examples of iterative changes to workflow processes and key lessons learned pertaining to protocol development, acceptability by stakeholders, alcohol procurement, documentation, and assessment. We discuss safety considerations, noting that there were no deaths or serious adverse events in any of the patients of the MAP during the 2-month implementation period. Conclusions: MAP pilots have been implemented in the US to aid adherence to isolation and quarantine setting guidelines. Lessons learned provide a foundation for their expansion as a recognized public health intervention for individuals with severe alcohol use disorders who are unable to stabilize within existing care systems. Based on the success of MAP implementation, efforts are under way to investigate alcohol management in homeless populations more broadly.","Ristau, Jessica; Mehtani, Nicky; Gomez, Seth; Nance, Michelle; Keller, Devora; Surlyn, Colleen; Eveland, Joanna; Smith-Bernardin, Shannon",Subst Abus,,52

Methods: Details of neurotrauma admissions under the neurosurgery department at our institute since the onset of COVID-19 pandemic in the country were collected retrospectively and compared to the same period last year in terms of demographic profile, mode of injury, GCS at admission, severity of head injury, radiological diagnosis, management (surgical/conservative), and outcome. The patients were studied according to which phase of pandemic they were admitted in - ""lockdown"" period (March 25 to May 31, 2020) or ""unlock"" period (June 1 to September 15, 2020). Results: The number of head injuries decreased by 16.8% during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, during the lockdown period, the number of admissions was 2.7/week while it was 6.8/week during the ""unlock"" period. RTA was the mode of injury in 29.6% patients during the lockdown, while during the unlock period, it was 56.9% (P = 0.000). Mild and moderate head injuries decreased by 41% and severe head injuries increased by 156.25% during the COVID-19 pandemic (P = 0.000). The mortality among neurotrauma patients increased from 12.4% to 22.5% during the COVID-19 era (P = 0.009). Conclusion: We observed a decline in the number of head injury admissions during the pandemic, especially during the lockdown. At the same time, there was increase in the severity of head injuries and associated injuries, resulting in significantly higher mortality in our patients during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Goyal, Nishant; Swain, Srikant Kumar; Gupta, Kanav; Chaturvedi, Jitender; Arora, Rajnish Kumar; Sharma, Suresh K",Surg Neurol Int,,52

Medical students experience inevitable transition from pre-clinical to clinical training with increasingly more independence and responsibility. This study aimed to identify well-being issues in undergraduate clinical students. The emotional, physical, social, spiritual, occupational and intellectual aspects of well-being were focused on. A thorough literature search was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies reporting issues from the six aspects of well-being in undergraduate clinical students, and published in peer-reviewed journals in English language from the year 2000 to 2020 with full-text available online were included. The initial search from PubMed, OVID Medline, Psych INFO and CINAHL Plus retrieved 623 articles with 51 studies included in this review. Evidence from the previous studies demonstrated poor well-being among undergraduate clinical students. Stress, lack of exercise, low peer and family support, and mistreatment by clinicians and patients were common well-being issues encountered. Based on this literature review, the five aspects of well-being except the emotional aspect were less explored. Thus, it will be of interest to investigate well-being issues among Malaysian undergraduate clinical students from the physical and occupational aspects, which are further impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify possible contributing factors. Undergraduate clinical students are faced with several well-being issues. Thus, early detection of these issues is important to avoid devastating consequences to students and patients. © Malaysian Association of Education in Medicine and Health Sciences and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia. 2021","Lin, C.

Although several standardized handoff strategies have been developed, their sustainability remains is poor. Little is known regarding factors that impede handoff standardization. PURPOSE: Our objectives are three-fold: (1) highlight compliance failures with standardized handoffs; (2) identify factors contributing to compliance failures; and (3) develop guidelines for sustainable handoff interventions and processes. METHODS: We used ethnographic data collection methods-general observations, handoff shadowing, and semi-structured clinician interviews-with 84 participants from OR, ICU, and telemedicine teams at a large academic medical center. We conducted thematic analysis supported by inductive and deductive coding using the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) framework. RESULTS: Post-operative handoffs can be characterized into four phases: pre-transfer preparation, transfer and setup, report preparation and delivery, and post-transfer care. We identified compliance failures with standardized handoff protocols and associated risk factors within the OR-ICU work system including limited teamwork, absence of handoff-specific tools, and poor clinician buy-in. To improve handoffs, clinicians provided suggestions for developing collaborative Electronic Health Record (EHR)-integrated handoff tools and re-engineering the handoff process. CONCLUSIONS: Compliance failures are prevalent in all handoff phases, leading to poor adherence with standardization. We propose theoretically grounded guidelines for designing ""flexibly standardized"" bundled handoff interventions for ensuring care continuity in OR to ICU transitions of care.","Abraham, Joanna; Meng, Alicia; Sona, Carrie; Wildes, Troy; Avidan, Michael; Kannampallil, Thomas",Int J Med Inform,,52

To reduce introduction of SARS-CoV-2 infections, the state of Alaska implemented a program on June 6, 2020, for arriving air, sea, and road travelers that required either molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, or a 14-day self-quarantine after arrival. The Alaska Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) used weekly standardized reports submitted by 10 participating Alaska airports to evaluate air traveler choices to undergo testing or self-quarantine, traveler test results, and airport personnel experiences while implementing the program. Among 386,435 air travelers who arrived in Alaska during June 6-November 14, 2020, a total of 184,438 (48%) chose to be tested within 72 hours before arrival, 111,370 (29%) chose to be tested on arrival, and 39,685 (10%) chose to self-quarantine without testing after arrival. An additional 15,112 persons received testing at airport testing sites; these were primarily travelers obtaining a second test 7-14 days after arrival, per state guidance. Of the 126,482 airport tests performed in Alaska, 951 (0.8%) results were positive, or one per 406 arriving travelers. Airport testing program administrators reported that clear communication, preparation, and organization were vital for operational success; challenges included managing travelers' expectations and ensuring that sufficient personnel and physical space were available to conduct testing. Expected mitigation measures such as vaccination, physical distancing, mask wearing, and avoidance of gatherings after arrival might also help limit postarrival transmission. Posttravel self-quarantine and testing programs might reduce travel-associated SARS-CoV-2 transmission and importation, even without enforcement. Traveler education and community and industry partnerships might help ensure success.","Ohlsen, Elizabeth C; Porter, Kimberly A; Mooring, Eric; Cutchins, Coleman; Zink, Anne; McLaughlin, Joseph",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,52
518793,Metabolic Flexibility Assists Reprograming of Central and Peripheral Innate Immunity During Neurodevelopment,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Lysosomal storage diseases (LSD) constitute an important group of metabolic diseases, consisting of approximately 60 disorders. In some types of lysosomal diseases, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is administered intravenously in weekly or biweekly doses. Unfortunately, scheduled ERT during COVID-19 was disrupted. We considered the possibility of adverse outcomes caused by the disruption in the treatment of patients with lysosomal storage disorders. METHODS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a questionnaire that was delivered via Internet to assess how this vulnerable patient group was affected by the pandemic in terms of their access to treatment and their disease-related symptoms. RESULTS: The questionnaire was filled out by 75 patients. There were 35 patients whose treatment dose was missed because of COVID-19. The most common reason for skipping treatment was not wanting to go to the hospital for fear of contracting COVID-19. These 35 patients missed a median of four doses of ERT (range: 1-16 dosages). Twenty-one patients (60%) claimed that they were affected physically by not taking ERT (20 mucopolysaccaridoses, 1 Fabry disease), whereas 14 (40%) did not. CONCLUSIONS: Interruption of ERT during the COVID-19 pandemic may have significant consequences. It may be beneficial to switch to home treatment or reserve dedicated facilities. With proper planning and management, the treatment disruptions of this particular group can be avoided.","Kahraman, Ayça Burcu; Yildiz, Yilmaz; Çiki, Kismet; Akar, Halil Tuna; Erdal, Izzet; Dursun, Ali; Tokatli, Aysegül; Sivri, Hatice Serap",J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab,,52

To better understand what is happening and to provide public health policy planners and clinicians timely information, we have searched and reviewed published studies about discharged patients testing positive again for the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Our search found 12 reports, all of which described patients in China. Our review of these reports indicates the presence of discharged patients who remain asymptomatic but test positive. However, it is unclear whether they are contagious because a positive reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR) test does not necessarily indicate the presence of replicating and transmissible virus. Our review suggests the need for timely, parallel testing of different samples, including, for example, fecal specimens, from COVID-19 patients before and after they are discharged from hospitals.","Han, Zhiyong; Battaglia, Fortunato; Terlecky, Stanley R",J Med Virol,,52

A perspective,2021,"From 21 January 2020 to 9 February 2020, three family clusters involving 31 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 were identified in Wenzhou, China. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the family cluster patients were analysed and compared with those of 43 contemporaneous sporadic cases. The three index cases transmitted the infection to 28 family members 2-10 days before illness onset. Overall, 28 of the 41 sporadic cases and three of 31 patients in the family clusters came back from Wuhan (65.12 vs. 9.68%, P< 0.001). In terms of epidemiological characters and clinical symptoms, no significant differences were observed between the family cluster and sporadic cases. However, the lymphocyte counts of sporadic cases were significantly lower than those of family cluster cases ((1.32 ± 0.55) × 109/l vs. (1.63 ± 0.70) × 109/l, P = 0.037), and the proportion of hypoalbuminaemia was higher in sporadic cases (18/43, 41.86%) than in the family clusters (6/31, 19.35%) (P < 0.05). Within the family cluster, the second- and third-generation cases had milder clinical manifestations, without severe conditions, compared with the index and first-generation cases, indicating that the virulence gradually decreased following passage through generations within the family clusters. Close surveillance, timely recognition and isolation of the suspected or latent patient is crucial in preventing family cluster infection.","Li, Jing; Ding, Jiguang; Chen, Li; Hong, Liang; Yu, Xiaoqi; Ye, Enling; Sun, Gangqiang; Zhang, Binbin; Zhang, Xinxin; Sun, Qingfeng",Epidemiol Infect,,52

590601,Pickering Emulsions: Versatility of Colloidal Particles and Recent Applications,2020-05-08,"OBJECTIVES: To understand the impact of COVID-19 and public health measures on different social groups, we conducted a mixed-methods study in five countries (‘SEBCOV—social, ethical and behavioural aspects of COVID-19’). Here, we report the results of the online survey. STUDY DESIGN AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Overall, 5058 respondents from Thailand, Malaysia, the UK, Italy and Slovenia completed the self-administered survey between May and June 2020. Poststratification weighting was applied, and associations between categorical variables assessed. Frequency counts and percentages were used to summarise categorical data. Associations between categorical variables were assessed using Pearson’s χ(2) test. Data were analysed in Stata 15.0 RESULTS: Among the five countries, Thai respondents reported having been most, and Slovenian respondents least, affected economically. The following factors were associated with greater negative economic impacts: being 18–24 years or 65 years or older; lower education levels; larger households; having children under 18 in the household and and having flexible/no income. Regarding social impact, respondents expressed most concern about their social life, physical health, mental health and well-being. There were large differences between countries in terms of voluntary behavioural change, and in compliance and agreement with COVID-19 restrictions. Overall, self-reported compliance was higher among respondents who self-reported a high understanding of COVID-19. UK respondents felt able to cope the longest and Thai respondents the shortest with only going out for essential needs or work. Many respondents reported seeing news perceived to be fake, the proportion varying between countries, with education level and self-reported levels of understanding of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that COVID-19 and public health measures have uneven economic and social impacts on people from different countries and social groups. Understanding the factors associated with these impacts can help to inform future public health interventions and mitigate their negative consequences.

Since there is no approved anti-viral drug or vaccine declared for the disease and investigating existing drugs against the COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: AYUSH-64 is an Ayurvedic formulation, developed and patented by Central Council of Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, India, has been in clinical use as anti-malarial, anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic drug for few decades. Thus, the present study was undertaken to evaluate AYUSH-64 compounds available in this drug against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus (SARS-CoV-2) Main Protease (M(pro); PDB ID: 6LU7) via in silico techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Different molecular docking software’s of Discovery studio and Auto Dock Vina were used for drugs from selected AYUSH-64 compounds against SARS-CoV-2. We also conducted 100 ns period of molecular dynamics simulations with Desmond and further MM/GBSA for the best complex of AYUSH-64 with M(pro) of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Among 36 compounds of four ingredients of AYUSH-64 screened, 35 observed to exhibits good binding energies than the published positive co-crystal compound of N3 pepetide. The best affinity and interactions of Akuammicine N-Oxide (from Alstonia scholaris) towards the M(pro) with binding energy (AutoDock Vina) of -8.4 kcal/mol and Discovery studio of Libdock score of 147.92 kcal/mol. Further, molecular dynamics simulations with MM-GBSA were also performed for M(pro)– Akuammicine N-Oxide docked complex to identify the stability, specific interaction between the enzyme and the ligand. Akuammicine N-Oxide is strongly formed h-bonds with crucial M(pro) residues, Cys145, and His164. CONCLUSION: The results provide lead that, the presence of M(pro)– Akuammicine N-Oxide with highest M(pro) binding energy along with other 34 chemical compounds having similar activity as part of AYUSH-64 make it a suitable candidate for repurposing to management of COVID-19 by further validating through experimental, clinical studies.","Ram, Thrigulla Saketh; Munikumar, Manne; Raju, Vankudavath Naik; Devaraj, Parasannanavar; Boiroju, Naveen Kumar; Hemalatha, Rajkumar; Prasad, P.V.V.; Gundeti, Manohar; Sisodia, Brijesh S.; Pawar, Sharad; Prasad, G.P.; Chincholikar, Mukesh; Goel, Sumeet; Mangal, Anupam; Gaidhani, Sudesh; Srikanth, N.; Dhiman, K.S.",J Ayurveda Integr Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S097594762100019X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33654345/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S097594762100019X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaim.2021.02.004,52

Educators approached curriculum design seeking to replicate as much of the in-person experience as possible and were faced with overcoming the challenges of replacing the innately hands-on nature of surgery with virtual operative and skills experiences. Restrictions on in-person visiting electives expedited the role of virtual education as a notable opportunity for medical student education and recruitment, with a variety of approaches to engaging undergraduate medical learners including the use of live-streaming operative cases, virtual didactic curricula and a rise in podcasts, web-based conferences, and virtual journal clubs. In addition to education, virtual outreach to medical students has become an essential tool in trainee recruitment and selection, and ongoing application of novel educational platforms will allow for new opportunities in multi-institutional collaboration and exchange with a multitude of benefits to future vascular surgery trainees. This paper seeks to outline the resources and practices used to virtually teach and recruit medical students and the benefits of virtual rotations to the program and students.","Ottinger, Mary E.; Farley, Lauren J.; Harding, Joel P.; Harry, Lauren A.; Cardella, Jonathan A.; Shukla, Ankur J.",Semin Vasc Surg,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.semvascsurg.2021.06.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34642033/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895796721000417?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0895796721000417,52

The government of Ethiopia takes preventive measures but the number of peoples infected with COVID-19 has been increased. Control of the pandemic requires changing of knowledge, attitude and practice of people. Hence, the objective of this study was to assess chronic disease patients’ knowledge, attitude and practice towards COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Institution based cross-sectional study was done among 413 chronic disease patients from July 20 to August 5, 2020 in Dessie town hospitals. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used and significant association declared at p-value of <0.05. RESULTS: From the total participants 34.6%, 81.4% and 40.7% had good knowledge, attitude and practice while 35.1%, 12.1% and 24.7% had moderate knowledge, attitude and practice towards COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. In multinomial logistic regression young age, urban residency, attainment of secondary education and presence of additional co-morbidity were predictors of moderate knowledge whereas urban residency, not attended formal education and presence of additional co-morbidity were predictors of good knowledge about COVID-19. Household family size and presence of additional co-morbidity were factors significantly associated with moderate practice of COVID-19 prevention methods. Furthermore, male sex, household family size, knowledge of COVID-19 and attitude towards COVID-19 were factors significantly associated with good practice of COVID-19 prevention methods. CONCLUSION: Significant number of chronic disease patients had poor knowledge and practice towards COVID-19.

Articles published between 24 January 2020 and 30 May 2021 were retrieved via a PubMed and EMBASE search. A total of 12 reports on phase-3 clinical trials and observational studies of COVID-19 vaccines were included in the review. In terms of vaccine safety, mRNA vaccines showed more relevance to serious adverse events than viral vector and inactivated vaccines, but no solid evidence indicated that COVID-19 vaccines directly caused serious adverse events. Serious metabolic, musculoskeletal, immune-system, and renal disorders were more common among inactivated vaccine recipients, and serious gastrointestinal complications and infections were more common among viral vector and inactivated vaccine recipients. The occurrence of serious vessel disorders was more frequent in mRNA vaccines. In terms of efficacy, two mRNA vaccine doses conferred a lesser risk of SARS-COV-2 infection (odds ratio: 0.05; 95% confidence interval: 0.02–0.13) than did vaccination with viral vector and inactivated vaccines. All vaccines protected more against symptomatic than asymptomatic cases (risk ratio, 0.11 vs. 0.34), but reduced the risk of severe SARS-COV-2 infection. The COVID-19 vaccines assessed in this study are sufficiently safe and effective. The results indicate that two mRNA vaccine doses prevent SARS-COV-2 infection most effectively, but further research is needed due to the high degree of heterogeneity among studies in this sample. Interventions should be implemented continuously to reduce the risks of infection after one vaccine dose and asymptomatic infection.","Fan, Yu-Jing; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Hung, Ivan Fan-Ngai",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34579226/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9090989,52

Most affected people show no or mild symptoms, but the risk of severe disease and death increases in older people. Here, we report a narrative review on selected studies targeting aging-related chronic neuroinflammation in the COVID-19 pandemic. A hyperactivation of the innate immune system with elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines occurs during severe COVID-19, pointing to an important role of the innate immune dysregulation in the disease outcome. Aging is characterized by a general condition of low-grade inflammation, also connected to chronic inflammation of the brain (neuroinflammation), which is involved in frailty syndrome and contributes to several age-associated diseases, including neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Since neuroinflammation can be induced or worsened by the virus infection itself, as well as by stressful conditions like those linked to the recent pandemic, the role of neuroinflammatory mechanisms could be central in a vicious circle leading to an increase in the mortality risk in aged COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, triggered neuroinflammatory pathways and consequent neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric conditions might be potential long-term complications of COVID-19. In order to provide insights to help clinicians in identifying patients who progress to a more severe case of the disease, this review underlines the potential implications of aging-related neuroinflammation in COVID-19 pandemic.","Bossù, Paola; Toppi, Elisa; Sterbini, Valentina; Spalletta, Gianfranco",J Pers Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32858874/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm10030102,52

However, with social distancing policies and financial stress during an outbreak, traditional robust survey methodologies of face-to-face, probabilistic sampling, may not be feasible to deploy quickly, especially in developing countries. We recommend a protocol that calls for a sensitive survey design, acceptance of a web-based approach and adjustments for uncertainty of respondents, to deliver urgently needed information to policymakers as the public health crisis unfolds, rather than in its aftermath. This information is critical to tailor comprehensive vaccination campaigns that reach critical immunity thresholds. We apply our recommendations in a regional study of 16 Latin American countries in the month following index cases of COVID-19. We use a split-sample, contingent valuation approach to evaluate the effects of cost, duration of immunity and effectiveness of the vaccine. Our results show that cost and duration of immunity are significant factors in the decision to vaccinate, while the degree of effectiveness is insignificant, unless the vaccine is 100% effective.

Nepal is struggling with the COVID-19 pandemic. The normal life of older adults, one of the vulnerable populations to COVID-19 infection, has been primarily impacted. The current evidence shows that the COVID-19 virus strains are deadly, and non-compliance to standard protocols can have serious consequences, increasing fear among older adults. This study assessed the perceived fear of COVID-19 and associated factors among older adults in eastern Nepal. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between July and September 2020 among 847 older adults (≥60 years) residing in three districts of eastern Nepal. Perceived fear of COVID-19 was measured using the seven-item Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S). Multivariate logistic regression identified the factors associated with COVID-19 fear. RESULTS: The mean score of the FCV-19S was 18.1 (SD = 5.2), and a sizeable proportion of older adults, ranging between 12%-34%, agreed with the seven items of the fear scale. Increasing age, Dalit ethnicity, remoteness to the health facility, and being concerned or overwhelmed with the COVID-19 were associated with greater fear of COVID-19. In contrast, preexisting health conditions were inversely associated with fear. CONCLUSION: Greater fear of the COVID-19 among the older adults in eastern Nepal suggests that during unprecedented times such as the current pandemic, the psychological needs of older adults should be prioritized. Establishing and integrating community-level mental health support as a part of the COVID-19 preparedness and response plan might help to combat COVID-19 fear among them.","Yadav, Uday Narayan; Yadav, Om Prakash; Singh, Devendra Raj; Ghimire, Saruna; Rayamajhee, Binod; Kanti Mistry, Sabuj; Rawal, Lal Bahadur; Ali, ARM Mehrab; Kumar Tamang, Man; Mehta, Suresh",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254825; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34310639/,52

Access to laboratory confirmation is limited and thus most reported figures are based on clinical diagnosis alone, the accuracy of which is uncertain. This systematic review assesses the diagnostic accuracy of the traditional (1997) and revised (2009) WHO clinical case definitions for dengue fever, the basis for most national guidelines. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, OpenGrey, and the annual Dengue Bulletin were searched for studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of the unmodified clinical criteria. Two reviewers (NR/SL) independently assessed eligibility, extracted data, and evaluated risk of bias using a modified QUADAS-2. Additional records were found by citation network analysis. A meta-analysis was done using a bivariate mixed-effects regression model. Studies that modified criteria were analysed separately. This systematic review protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020165998). We identified 11 and 12 datasets assessing the 1997 and 2009 definition, respectively, and 6 using modified criteria. Sensitivity was 93% (95% CI: 77–98) and 93% (95% CI: 86–96) for the 1997 and 2009 definitions, respectively. Specificity was 29% (95% CI: 8–65) and 31% (95% CI: 18–48) for the 1997 and 2009 definitions, respectively. Diagnostic performance suffered at the extremes of age. No modification significantly improved accuracy. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Diagnostic accuracy of clinical criteria is poor, with significant implications for surveillance and public health responses for dengue control. As the basis for most reported figures, this has relevance to policymakers planning resource allocation and researchers modelling transmission, particularly during COVID-19.","Raafat, Nader; Loganathan, Shanghavie; Mukaka, Mavuto; Blacksell, Stuart D.; Maude, Richard James",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33901191/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0009359,52

Sociocultural and political factors that shape conceptions of health and care tend to stifle research and the dissemination of knowledge throughout the Middle East. These socio-political challenges concerning engagement with individuals living with dementia and their carers include language barriers, stigmatization, logistical constraints, lack of informal support outside of hospitals, and over-dependence on clinicians for dementia information. There is an urgent need in the Middle East to increase care and support for adults with dementia and their carers, enhance research efforts and improve the dissemination of information related to dementia in the region. One possible way to do so is to begin to promote a knowledge-based culture throughout the Middle East. This can be achieved by aligning traditional deterministic and spiritual perspectives of mental health with more Western, scientific, and evidence-based models. We suggest employing practical, multidimensional approaches to deal with the stated challenges, both at individual and societal levels. Doing so will improve knowledge of dementia and allow health and social care systems in the Middle East to begin to address a growing problem.","Javaid, Syed Fahad; Al-Zahmi, Aishah; Abbas, Munir",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18084378; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33924161/,52

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the Electronically Retrieved Cohort of HCV Infected Veterans (ERCHIVES), a well‐established database of HCV infected Veterans in care. We excluded those with missing FIB‐4 score and those with HIV or hepatitis B virus coinfection. We determined the number of persons tested, proportion who tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2, and the infection rate by age and liver fibrosis stage. RESULTS: Among 172,235 persons with HCV, 14,305 (8.3%) were tested for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and 892 (6.2%) tested positive. Those with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection were older, more likely to be Black (55.2% vs. 37.8%), obese (body mass index >30kg/m(2) 36.2% vs. 29.7%) and have diabetes or stroke (p<0.0001 for all comparisons). Mean FIB‐4 scores and proportion of persons with cirrhosis (based on a FIB‐4 > 3.25) were similar in both groups. Incidence rate/1,000 tested persons was much higher among Blacks (88.4; 95% CI 81.1,96.2) vs. Whites (37.5; 95% CI 33.1,42.4) but similar among those with cirrhosis (FIB‐4>3.25). The rates were also similar among those who were untreated for HCV vs. those treated with or without attaining a sustained virologic response. CONCLUSIONS: Testing rates among persons with HCV are very low. Persons with infection are more likely to be Black, have a higher body mass index and diabetes or stroke. The degree of liver fibrosis does not appear to have an impact on infection rate.","Butt, Adeel A.; Yan, Peng",Liver Int,https://doi.org/10.1111/liv.14681; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006798/,52

The scale of this effort means that safety signals suggesting adverse effects may only be detectable using passive reporting. This paper examines reports to the CDC/FDA's VAERS system in the first six months of 2021, using an empirical Bayesian model with a gamma Poisson shrinker to identify potential safety signals from COVID-19 vaccines currently on the U.S. market. Based on this preliminary data, it is concluded that the COVID-19 vaccine's safety significantly exceeds that of previously marketed vaccines, and other than a known risk of thrombotic events, no safety signals of concern emerge.","von Csefalvay, C.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.10.21258589v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.10.21258589,52

To analyze how governments responded to the COVID-19 pandemic in these six Latin American countries, we use an index of government response, created by the University of Oxford. To explore the effects of these governmental mitigation policies on reducing social mobility, we use Google mobility reports. We also analyze how these policies may have influenced COVID-19 mortality rates. Overall, the results showed that both timelier and more stringent implementation of the public policies analyzed to address the COVID-19 pandemic seem to be associated with higher mobility reductions and lower mortality rates. We draw five policy lessons from the way each country implemented these mitigation policies. KEY MESSAGE: Timelier and more stringent implementation of these public policies may contribute to a higher mobility reduction in several public spaces and to lower mortality rates. The effectiveness of the closure and containment policies in each Latin American country seem to depend on the degree of compliance of their respective populations and to their socioeconomic living conditions. Economic and social policies of income support and debt relief provided by governments allowed people to comply with closure and containment policies. Health systems should maintain high levels of policy stringency together with effective surveillance through testing policy and contact tracing.

The aim of this study was the synthesis and evaluation of in vitro anti-HIV-1 activity for phosphate derivatives of 3-carboxyacylbetulin 3–5 as well as an in silico study of new compounds as potential ligands of the C-terminal domain of the HIV-1 capsid–spacer peptide 1 (CA-CTD-SP1) as a molecular target of HIV-1 maturation inhibitors. In vitro studies showed that 28-diethoxyphosphoryl-3-O-(3′,3′-dimethylsuccinyl)betulin (compound 3), the phosphate analog of bevirimat (betulinic acid derivative, HIV-1 maturation inhibitor), has IC(50) (half maximal inhibitory concentration) equal to 0.02 μM. Compound 3 inhibits viral replication at a level comparable to bevirimat and is also more selective (selectivity indices = 1250 and 967, respectively). Molecular docking was used to examine the probable interaction between the phosphate derivatives of 3-carboxyacylbetulin and C-terminal domain (CTD) of the HIV-1 capsid (CA)–spacer peptide 1 (SP1) fragment of Gag protein, designated as CTD-SP1. Compared with interactions between bevirimat (BVM) and the protein, an increased number of strong interactions between ligand 3 and the protein, generated by the phosphate group, were observed. These compounds might have the potential to also inhibit SARS-CoV2 proteins, in as far as the intrinsically imprecise docking scores suggest.","Marciniec, Krzysztof; Chrobak, Elwira; Dąbrowska, Aleksandra; Bębenek, Ewa; Kadela-Tomanek, Monika; Pęcak, Paweł; Boryczka, Stanisław",Biomolecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764519/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom10081148,52

Vaccines have been developed and authorized but supply of these vaccines is currently limited. With new variants of the virus now emerging and spreading globally, it is essential to develop therapeutics that are broadly protective and bind conserved epitopes in the receptor binding domain (RBD) or the whole spike of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we have generated mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against different epitopes on the RBD and assessed binding and neutralization against authentic SARS-CoV-2. We have demonstrated that antibodies with neutralizing activity, but not non-neutralizing antibodies, lower viral titers in the lungs when administered in a prophylactic setting in vivo in a mouse challenge model. In addition, most of the mAbs cross-neutralize the B.1.351 as well as the B.1.1.7 variants in vitro. Importance Crossneutralization of SARS-CoV-2 variants by RBD-targeting antibodies is still not well understood and very little is known about the potential protective effect of non-neutralizing antibodies in vivo. Using a panel of mouse monoclonal antibodies, we investigate both of these aspects.","Amanat, Fatima; Strohmeier, Shirin; Lee, Wen-Hsin; Bangaru, Sandhya; Ward, Andrew B.; Coughlan, Lynda; Krammer, Florian",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.05.438547,52

This paper investigates the role of social capital as a mediating factor for the spread of the virus. Because social capital is associated with greater trust and relationships within a community, it could endow individuals with a greater concern for others, thereby leading to more hygienic practices and social distancing. Using data for over 2,700 US counties, we investigate how social capital explains the level and growth rate of infections. We find that moving a county from the 25(th) to the 75(th) percentile of the distribution of social capital would lead to a 18% and 5.7% decline in the cumulative number of infections and deaths, as well as suggestive evidence of a lower spread of the virus.

The prevention and control measures for the outbreak have been downgraded to a normalized level. However, until now, the change in level of psychological health amongst perinatal women during the remission phase of the COVID-19 outbreak has not been investigated in China. The aim of this current study was to assess the symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia and quality of life (QOL) in perinatal women and to identify potential risk factors associated with these symptoms. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, hospital-based survey conducted between March 25(th) till June 5(th), 2020 in southern China. Convenient sampling method was adopted. Women’s anxiety, depression, insomnia symptoms and QOL was examined through standardized measurements. Multivariate logistic regression and Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted for the same. RESULTS: A total of 625 perinatal women completed the study; of them, 195 women (31.2%, 95%CI=27.56%–34.84%) reported anxiety, 120 (19.2%, 95%CI=16.10%–22.30%) reported depression, and 87 (13.9%, 95%CI=11.20%–16.64%) experienced symptoms of insomnia. Previous adverse experiences during pregnancy was a significant risk factor for anxiety (OR=1.628, 95%CI=1.069–2.480, P=0.023), depression (OR=1.853, 95%CI=1.153–2.977, P=0.011), and insomnia (OR=2.160, 95%CI=1.290-3.616, P=0.003). Participants having infected friends/families/colleagues were more likely to report anxiety (OR=2.195, 95%CI=1.245–3.871, P=0.007) and depression (OR=2.666, 95%CI=1.482–4.794, P=0.001). Those women whose regular check-ups were severely interrupted by the COVID-19 were also more likely to experience symptoms of anxiety (OR=2.935, 95%CI=1.701–5.062, P<0.001) and insomnia (OR=2.195, 95%CI=1.098–4.390, P=0.026). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic does affect the mental health and well being of perinatal women. Increased attention should be paid to women who have infected friends/families/colleagues and those with previous adverse experiences during pregnancy. Coping strategies that relieve psychological stress during the COVID-19 outbreak should be provided to prevent adverse outcomes for women and their infants.","Zeng, Xiaoqin; Li, Wengao; Sun, Hengwen; Luo, Xian; Garg, Samradhvi; Liu, Ting; Zhang, Jingying; Zhang, Yongfu",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33132935/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.571876,52

599224,Effect of Heat Stimulation on Circulating Irisin in Humans,2021-06-28,"Abstract The field of artificial intelligence (AI) is experiencing a period of intense progress due to the consolidation of several key technological enablers. AI is already deployed widely and has a high impact on work and daily life activities. The continuation of this process will likely contribute to deep economic and social changes. To realise the tremendous benefits of AI while mitigating undesirable effects will require enlightened responses by many stakeholders. Varying national institutional, economic, political, and cultural conditions will influence how AI will affect convenience, efficiency, personalisation, privacy protection, and surveillance of citizens. Many expect that the winners of the AI development race will dominate the coming decades economically and geopolitically, potentially exacerbating tensions between countries. Moreover, nations are under pressure to protect their citizens and their interests—and even their own political stability—in the face of possible malicious or biased uses of AI. On the one hand, these different stressors and emphases in AI development and deployment among nations risk a fragmentation between world regions that threatens technology evolution and collaboration. On the other hand, some level of differentiation will likely enrich the global AI ecosystem in ways that stimulate innovation and introduce competitive checks and balances through the decentralisation of AI development. International cooperation, typically orchestrated by intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations, private sector initiatives, and by academic researchers, has improved common welfare and avoided undesirable outcomes in other technology areas. Because AI will most likely have more fundamental effects on our lives than other recent technologies, stronger forms of cooperation that address broader policy and governance challenges in addition to regulatory and technological issues may be needed. At a time of great challenges among nations, international policy coordination remains a necessary instrument to tackle the ethical, cultural, economic, and political repercussions of AI. We propose to advance the emerging concept of technology diplomacy to facilitate the global alignment of AI policy and governance and create a vibrant AI innovation system. We argue that the prevention of malicious uses of AI and the enhancement of human welfare create strong common interests across jurisdictions that require sustained efforts to develop better, mutually beneficial approaches. We hope that new technology diplomacy will facilitate the dialogues necessary to help all interested parties develop a shared understanding and coordinate efforts to utilise AI for the benefit of humanity, a task whose difficulty should not be underestimated.","Feijóo, Claudio; Kwon, Youngsun; Bauer, Johannes M.; Bohlin, Erik; Howell, Bronwyn; Jain, Rekha; Potgieter, Petrus; Vu, Khuong; Whalley, Jason; Xia, Jun",Telecomm Policy,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030859612030080X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S030859612030080X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32377031/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2020.101988,52

The present study describes causes of febrile illness in hospitalized children in Ghana and aims to determine the burden of malaria coinfections and their association with parasite densities. METHODS: In a prospective study, children (aged ≥30 days and ≤15 years) with fever ≥38.0°C were recruited after admission to the pediatric ward of a primary hospital in Ghana. Malaria parasitemia was determined and blood, stool, urine, respiratory, and cerebrospinal fluid specimens were screened for parasitic, bacterial, and viral pathogens. Associations of Plasmodium densities with other pathogens were calculated. RESULTS: From November 2013 to April 2015, 1238 children were enrolled from 4169 admissions. A clinical/microbiological diagnosis could be made in 1109/1238 (90%) patients, with Plasmodium parasitemia (n = 728/1238 [59%]) being predominant. This was followed by lower respiratory tract infections/pneumonia (n = 411/1238 [34%]; among detected pathogens most frequently Streptococcus pneumoniae, n = 192/299 [64%]), urinary tract infections (n = 218/1238 [18%]; Escherichia coli, n = 21/32 [66%]), gastrointestinal infections (n = 210 [17%]; rotavirus, n = 32/97 [33%]), and invasive bloodstream infections (n = 62 [5%]; Salmonella species, n = 47 [76%]). In Plasmodium-infected children the frequency of lower respiratory tract, gastrointestinal, and bloodstream infections increased with decreasing parasite densities. CONCLUSIONS: In a hospital setting, the likelihood of comorbidity with a nonmalarial disease is inversely correlated with increasing blood levels of malaria parasites. Hence, parasite densities provide important information as an indicator for the probability of coinfection, in particular to guide antimicrobial medication.","Hogan, Benedikt; Eibach, Daniel; Krumkamp, Ralf; Sarpong, Nimako; Dekker, Denise; Kreuels, Benno; Maiga-Ascofaré, Oumou; Gyau Boahen, Kennedy; Wiafe Akenten, Charity; Adu-Sarkodie, Yaw; Owusu-Dabo, Ellis; May, Jürgen",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29408951/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/cix1120,52

We did this by carrying out sequence alignments and 3D modelling of related bacteriocins which have been studied in greater detail: Microcin E492, Enterocin AB heterodimer and Divercin V41. Microcin E492 interacts with Toll-Like Receptor 4 in order to activate an apoptosis reaction, sequence alignment showed a high homology between Pediocin PA-1 and Microcin E492 whereas 3D modelling showed Pediocin PA-1 interacting with TLR-4 in a way reminiscent of Microcin E492. Furthermore, Pediocin PA-1 had the highest homology with the Enterocin heterodimer, particularly chain A; Enterocin has also shown to cause an apoptotic response in cancer cells. Based on this we are led to strongly believe Pediocin PA-1 interacts with TLRs in order to cause cell death. If this is the case, it would explain the difference in cytotoxicity towards HeLa over HT29 cells, due to difference in expression of particular TLRs. Overall, we believe Pediocin PA-1 exhibits a dual effect which is dose dependant, like that of Microcin. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were unable to carry out experiments in the lab, and the unavailability of important data meant we were unable to provide and validate out solid conclusions, but rather suggestions. However, bioinformatic analysis is still able to provide information regarding structure and sequence analysis to draw plausible and evidence based conclusions. We have been able to highlight interesting findings and how these could be translated into future research and therapeutics in order to improve the quality of treatment and life of cancer patients.","Buss, George P.; Wilson, Cornelia M.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34473709/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251951,52

We assessed positivity rates and associated factors using five SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. A total of 228 paired serum samples (456 samples) were obtained from 228 participants. After baseline sampling, the second sampling was conducted between 11 and 28 days after the first dose of the AZ vaccine. Sera were tested using five SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays, including two surrogate virus neutralization tests. A questionnaire on the symptoms, severity, and duration of adverse reactions was completed by all participants. The overall positivity rates for SARS-CoV-2 antibody were 84.6% for the Roche assay, 92.5% for the Abbott assay, 75.4% for the Siemens assay, 90.7% for the SD Biosensor assay, and 66.2% for the GenScript assay after the first dose of the AZ vaccine. The positivity rates and antibody titers of sera obtained between 21 and 28 days were significantly higher than those obtained between 11 and 20 days in all five assays. More-severe adverse reactions and longer durations of adverse reactions were related to higher SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. The agreements and correlations among the assays applied were substantial (к, 0.73 to 0.95) and strong (ρ, 0.83 to 0.91). A single dose of the AZ vaccine led to high positivity rates based on the five assays. Days after vaccination and adverse reactions could help estimate serologic conversion rates. The results should be interpreted cautiously considering the assays and cutoffs applied.

602947,Applications of Gold Nanoparticles in the Detection and Identification of Infectious Diseases and Biothreats,2013-05-15,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 pandemic is having a devastating effect on the mental health and wellbeing of healthcare providers (HCPs) globally. This review is aimed at determining the prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress, fear, burnout and resilience and its associated factors among HCPs in Asia during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed literature search using 4 databases from Medline, Cinahl, PubMed and Scopus from inception up to March 15, 2021 and selected relevant cross-sectional studies. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plot. Random effects model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence while risk factors were reported in odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI. RESULTS: We included 148 studies with 159,194 HCPs and the pooled prevalence for depression was 37.5% (95%CI: 33.8–41.3), anxiety 39.7(95%CI: 34.3–45.1), stress 36.4% (95%CI: 23.2–49.7), fear 71.3% (95%CI: 54.6–88.0), burnout 68.3% (95%CI: 54.0–82.5), and low resilience was 16.1% (95%CI: 12.8–19.4), respectively. The heterogeneity was high (I2>99.4%). Meta-analysis reported that both females (OR = 1.48; 95% CI = 1.30–1.68) and nurses (OR = 1.21; 95%CI = 1.02–1.45) were at increased risk of having depression and anxiety [(Female: OR = 1.66; 95% CI = 1.49–1.85), (Nurse: OR = 1.36; 95%CI = 1.16–1.58)]. Females were at increased risk of getting stress (OR = 1.59; 95%CI = 1.28–1.97). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, one third of HCPs suffered from depression, anxiety and stress and more than two third of HCPs suffered from fear and burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic in Asia.","Ching, Siew Mooi; Ng, Kar Yean; Lee, Kai Wei; Yee, Anne; Lim, Poh Ying; Ranita, Hisham; Devaraj, Navin Kumar; Ooi, Pei Boon; Cheong, Ai Theng",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257983; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34648526/,52

The N‐terminal part is composed of an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) followed by a structured domain called the N‐terminal domain (NTD). In this study, the structure determination of the N‐terminal region of the MERS‐CoV N protein via X‐ray diffraction measurements is reported at a resolution of 2.4 Å. Since the first 30 amino acids were not resolved by X‐ray diffraction, the structural study was completed by a SAXS experiment to propose a structural model including the IDR.

Methods Retrospective review of medical records of patients seen in Sleep and Circadian Clinic at Brigham Health during the immediate period of one month after the national lockdown was announced on March 15, 2020. Patients with OSA were included only if PAP adherence data was available in the 12- months prior and in the month after the lockdown. Patients with other sleep disorders and OSA patients without the adherence data were excluded. Results Mean age was 63.5 +/- 13.9 years, 55% of the participants were men, and mean BMI was 31.8 +/- 7.9 kg/m2. Severe OSA was noted among 59.5% compared to 29.3% moderate, and 11.2% mild OSA. Increased number of patients reported insomnia after the lockdown (41% vs 48%, p= 0.02). Gender stratification noted worsening insomnia only among women. There was no significant difference in PAP adherence as measured by the hours of use, self-reported sleep duration or in the use of sleep medications. Conclusion Post COVID-19 lockdown had a negative impact on sleep as evidenced by increased reporting of insomnia particularly among women, but no impact on PAP adherence or self-reported sleep duration.","Batool-Anwar, S.; Omobomi, O.

Our objective was to utilize administrative data to build an explanatory model accounting for geriatrics-focused indicators to predict mortality in hospitalized older adults with COVID-19. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of adults age 65 and older (N = 4783) hospitalized with COVID-19 in the greater New York metropolitan area between 3/1/20-4/20/20. Data included patient demographics and clinical presentation. Stepwise logistic regression with Akaike Information Criterion minimization was used. RESULTS: The average age was 77.4 (SD = 8.4), 55.9% were male, 20.3% were African American, and 15.0% were Hispanic. In multivariable analysis, male sex (adjusted odds ration (adjOR) = 1.06, 95% CI:1.03-1.09); Asian race (adjOR = 1.08, CI:1.03-1.13); history of chronic kidney disease (adjOR = 1.05, CI:1.01-1.09) and interstitial lung disease (adjOR = 1.35, CI:1.28-1.42); low or normal body mass index (adjOR:1.03, CI:1.00-1.07); higher comorbidity index (adjOR = 1.01, CI:1.01-1.02); admission from a facility (adjOR = 1.14, CI:1.09-1.20); and mechanical ventilation (adjOR = 1.52, CI:1.43-1.62) were associated with mortality. While age was not an independent predictor of mortality, increasing age (centered at 65) interacted with hypertension (adjOR = 1.02, CI:0.98-1.07, reducing by a factor of 0.96 every 10 years); early Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR, life-sustaining treatment preferences) (adjOR = 1.38, CI:1.22-1.57, reducing by a factor of 0.92 every 10 years); and severe illness on admission (at 65, adjOR = 1.47, CI:1.40-1.54, reducing by a factor of 0.96 every 10 years). CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight that residence prior to admission, early DNR, and acute illness severity are important predictors of mortality in hospitalized older adults with COVID-19. Readily available administrative geriatrics-focused indicators that go beyond age can be utilized when considering prognosis.

604827,Nature killer cells in the central nervous system,2010-01-29,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the difference of inflammatory cytokines and lymphocyte subsets between deceased patients and survivors with COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective study included 254 confirmed patients from 10 January to 11 March, 2020, at Tongji Hospital of Wuhan, China. Laboratory and immunologic features were collected and analyzed, and the main outcomes focused on inflammatory cytokines and lymphocyte subsets. RESULTS: A trend of markedly higher levels of inflammatory cytokines as well as lower lymphocyte subset levels in deceased patients was observed compared with survivors. ROC curve analyses indicated that inflammatory cytokines and the decrease levels of T cell, Th (helper T cells) cell, Ts (suppressor T cells) cell, B cell, and NK cell along with Th/Ts ratio increase could be used to predict the death of COVID-19. Multivariate analyses showed that higher levels of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 remained significantly correlated with shorter survival time and that the amount of Ts cells was negatively associated with the possibility of death in COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 would cause lymphopenia and result in decreased lymphocyte subset cells, particularly in Ts cell counts, which further induces hyperinflammatory response and cytokine storm. IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and Ts cell might be independent predictors for the poor outcome of COVID-19.","Jiang, Nan; Li, Zhijun; Yang, Bo; Jin, Mengdi; Sun, Yaoyao; He, Yang; Liu, Yang; Wang, Yueying; Si, Daoyuan; Ma, Piyong; Zhang, Jinnan; Liu, Tianji; Yu, Qiong",Biomed Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33542929/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/9101082,52
605131,Research in non-rodent vertebrates enlightens the immunological landscape,2021-03-16,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is a global threat presenting health, economic and social challenges that continue to escalate. Meta-population epidemic modeling studies in the susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) style have played important roles in informing public health and shaping policy making to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. These models typically rely on a key assumption on the homogeneity of the population. This assumption certainly cannot be expected to hold true in real situations; various geographic, socioeconomic and cultural environments affect the behaviors that drive the spread of COVID-19 in different communities. What's more, variation of intra-county environments creates spatial heterogeneity of transmission in different sub-regions. To address this issue, we develop a new human mobility flow-augmented stochastic SEIR-style epidemic modeling framework with the ability to distinguish different regions and their corresponding behavior. This new modeling framework is then combined with data assimilation and machine learning techniques to reconstruct the historical growth trajectories of COVID-19 confirmed cases in two counties in Wisconsin. The associations between the spread of COVID-19 and human mobility, business foot-traffic, race & ethnicity, and age-group are then investigated. The results reveal that in a college town (Dane County) the most important heterogeneity is spatial, while in a large city area (Milwaukee County) racial-ethnic heterogeneity becomes more apparent. Scenario studies further indicate a strong response of the spread rate on various reopening policies, which suggests that policymakers may need to take these heterogeneities into account very carefully when designing policies for mitigating the spread of COVID-19 and reopening.","Hou, X.; Gao, S.; Li, Q.; Kang, Y.; Chen, N.; Chen, K.; Rao, J.; Ellenberg, J.

SETTING: Series of online surveys undertaken between March and October 2020. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 25 separate national samples (matched to country population by age and sex) in 12 different countries were recruited through online panel providers (n=25 334). PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Reported willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: Reported willingness to receive a vaccine varied widely across samples, ranging from 63% to 88%. Multivariate logistic regression analyses reveal sex (female OR=0.59, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.64), trust in medical and scientific experts (OR=1.28, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.34) and worry about the COVID-19 virus (OR=1.47, 95% CI 1.41 to 1.53) as the strongest correlates of stated vaccine acceptance considering pooled data and the most consistent correlates across countries. In a subset of UK samples, we show that these effects are robust after controlling for attitudes towards vaccination in general.

Supporting individuals to develop strategies to maintain a healthier weight when there are additional life challenges may prevent relapse. This mixed-methods study describes the impact the COVID-19 restrictions had on adults engaged in weight management before and during the pandemic in order to determine helpful strategies. METHODS: Longitudinal data was captured from online surveys completed by Slimming World (SW) members 0–4 weeks after joining, October/November 2019, providing pre-joining and baseline (T0&T1), 3- (T2) and 6- month (T3-during COVID-19) data. Representatives from the general population, not attending a weight management service, completed the same questionnaires providing cross-sectional control data. All weights are self-reported. For this study, questions assessing the impact of the COVID-19 challenges on health-related behaviours and well-being are included comparing responses at T0/T1, T2 & T3. Longitudinal data were analysed using repeated measures ANOVA and cross-sectional data, one-way independent ANOVAs to compare means. Comparisons between SW members and controls were determined using z-proportion tests. Qualitative data generated was thematically analysed using a six-step approach to produce the key emerging themes. RESULTS: 222 SW members completed all three surveys, achieving a weight loss of 7.7 ± 7.5%. They maintained positive health-related behaviour changes made since joining, including increased fruit and vegetables (p < 0.001), fewer sugary drinks (p < 0.001), cooking from scratch (p < 0.001) and increased activity levels (p < 0.001). Despite COVID-19 restrictions, they were still reporting improvements in all behaviours and had healthier scores than the controls on all but alcohol intake, although still within guidelines. Qualitative data indicated that the situation created various challenges to managing weight with fresh foods harder to access, comfort eating, drinking more alcohol, eating more sugary foods and snacking through boredom. However, some reported having more free time enabling better planning, more time to cook from scratch and increased physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the value of peer, group and online support and guidance for individuals to develop sustainable behaviour changes and a level of resilience. These strategies can then be drawn upon enabling maintenance of lifestyle changes and management of weight even in challenging times.","Avery, Amanda; Toon, Josef; Kent, Jennifer; Holloway, Laura; Lavin, Jacquie; Bennett, Sarah-Elizabeth",BMC Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11143-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34134642/,52
607755,Cell-Penetrating Peptides for Antiviral Drug Development,2010-03-02,"INTRODUCTION: Current antibiotic prescription for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is generally based on the Anthonisen criteria in The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (GOLD) guideline that have a potential risk of antibiotics overuse. The dilemma is to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from antibiotics while avoiding unnecessary antibiotic use. Procalcitonin (PCT), a more sensitive and specific biomarker of bacterial infection than other conventional laboratory tests, has the potential to determine those patients in whom antibiotics would be beneficial. It is unclear whether PCT-guided antibiotic therapy is safe and effective for patients hospitalised with AECOPD. The study hypothesis is that PCT-guided antibiotic therapy could reduce the antibiotic prescription rate for AECOPD, compared with the GOLD guideline recommendations, without negatively impacting the treatment success rate. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this multicenter, open-label, randomised controlled trial, we aim to enrol 500 hospitalised patients with AECOPD that will be randomly assigned to either a PCT-guided group or a GOLD guideline-guided group. The coprimary endpoints are antibiotic prescription rate for AECOPD within 30 days post randomisation and treatment success rate at day 30 post randomisation. The secondary outcomes include: antibiotic prescription rate at day 1 post randomisation; hospital antibiotic exposure; length of hospital stay; rate of subsequent exacerbation and hospital readmission; overall mortality within 30 days post randomisation; changes in lung function and the score of COPD assessment test and modified Medical Research Council; and rate of intensive care unit admission. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial has been approved by the ethic committee of China–Japan Friendship Hospital. The findings of the study will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals. If the results of the study are positive, PCT-guided antibiotic therapy is likely to change the guidelines for antibiotic recommendations for patients with AECOPD.

In spite of the wide range of screening tools, there are not many reliable and widespread tools for the identification of psychological symptoms in non-clinical populations during a health crisis. Objective: The aim of this study was to conduct a psychometric analysis of the Goldberg's GHQ-28 (1) through a sample of Peruvian adults using confirmatory factor analysis. Materials and methods: 434 individuals have been examined, studying the goodness and structure of the Goldberg GHQ-28 questionnaire. Result: We found high reliability indicating optimal values ( by Cronbach = .829), also there are four correlated factors that show strict invariance among the 28 items. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) were used to examine the structure of the subscales. There are high levels of anxiety (X=1.01) and social dysfunction (X=1.21) in the assessed sampling. Conclusion: The factorial structure obtained in this study is similar to that originally described by the researchers involved in the original questionnaire.

609414,Host genetic background influences diverse neurological responses to viral infection in mice,2017-09-22,"BACKGROUND: The Eliminate Yellow fever Epidemics (EYE) strategy was launched in 2017 in response to the resurgence of yellow fever in Africa and the Americas. The strategy relies on several vaccination activities, including preventive mass vaccination campaigns (PMVCs). However, to what extent PMVCs are associated with a decreased risk of outbreak has not yet been quantified. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used the self-controlled case series (SCCS) method to assess the association between the occurrence of yellow fever outbreaks and the implementation of PMVCs at the province level in the African endemic region. As all time-invariant confounders are implicitly controlled for in the SCCS method, this method is an alternative to classical cohort or case–control study designs when the risk of residual confounding is high, in particular confounding by indication. The locations and dates of outbreaks were identified from international epidemiological records, and information on PMVCs was provided by coordinators of vaccination activities and international funders. The study sample consisted of provinces that were both affected by an outbreak and targeted for a PMVC between 2005 and 2018. We compared the incidence of outbreaks before and after the implementation of a PMVC. The sensitivity of our estimates to a range of assumptions was explored, and the results of the SCCS method were compared to those obtained through a retrospective cohort study design. We further derived the number of yellow fever outbreaks that have been prevented by PMVCs. The study sample consisted of 33 provinces from 11 African countries. Among these, the first outbreak occurred during the pre-PMVC period in 26 (79%) provinces, and during the post-PMVC period in 7 (21%) provinces. At the province level, the post-PMVC period was associated with an 86% reduction (95% CI 66% to 94%, p < 0.001) in the risk of outbreak as compared to the pre-PMVC period. This negative association between exposure to PMVCs and outbreak was robustly observed across a range of sensitivity analyses, especially when using quantitative estimates of vaccination coverage as an alternative exposure measure, or when varying the observation period. In contrast, the results of the cohort-style analyses were highly sensitive to the choice of covariates included in the model. Based on the SCCS results, we estimated that PMVCs were associated with a 34% (95% CI 22% to 45%) reduction in the number of outbreaks in Africa from 2005 to 2018. A limitation of our study is the fact that it does not account for potential time-varying confounders, such as changing environmental drivers of yellow fever and possibly improved disease surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we provide new empirical evidence of the high preventive impact of PMVCs on yellow fever outbreaks. This study illustrates that the SCCS method can be advantageously applied at the population level in order to evaluate a public health intervention.","Jean, Kévin; Raad, Hanaya; Gaythorpe, Katy A.

612360,The multi-faceted roles of TGF-β in regulation of immunity to infection.,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than 3.8 million deaths worldwide, and several types of COVID-19 vaccines are urgently approved for use, including adenovirus vectored vaccines. However, the thermal instability and pre-existing immunity have limited its wide applications. To circumvent these obstacles, we constructed a self-biomineralized adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccine (Sad23L-nCoV-S-CaP) by generating a calcium phosphate mineral exterior (CaP) based on Sad23L vector carrying the full-length gene of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) under physiological condition. This Sad23L-nCoV-S-CaP vaccine was examined for its characteristics of structure, thermostability, immunogenicity and avoiding the problem of preexisting immunity. In thermostability test, Sad23L-nCoV-S-CaP could be stored at 4 °C for over 45 days, 26 °C for more than 8 days and 37 °C for approximately 2 days. Furthermore, Sad23L-nCoV-S-CaP induced higher level of S-specific antibody and T cell responses, and was not affected by the pre-existing anti-Sad23L immunity, suggesting it could be used as boosting immunization on Sad23L-nCoV-S priming vaccination. The boosting with Sad23L-nCoV-S-CaP vaccine induced high titers of 10(5.01) anti-S1, 10(4.77) anti-S2 binding antibody, 10(3.04) pseudovirus neutralizing antibody (IC(50)), and robust T-cell response of IFN-γ (1466.16 SFCs/10(6) cells) to S peptides, respectively. In summary, the self-biomineralization of the COVID-19 vaccine Sad23L-nCoV-S-CaP improved vaccine efficacy, which could be used in prime-boost regimen for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.

612829,Valinomycin as a potential antiviral agent against coronaviruses: a review,2020-08-11,"When faced with an ambiguous pronoun, comprehenders use both multimodal cues (e.g., gestures) and linguistic cues to identify the antecedent. While research has shown that gestures facilitate language comprehension, improve reference tracking, and influence the interpretation of ambiguous pronouns, literature on reference resolution suggests that a wide set of linguistic constraints influences the successful resolution of ambiguous pronouns and that linguistic cues are more powerful than some multimodal cues. To address the outstanding question of the importance of gesture as a cue in reference resolution relative to cues in the speech signal, we have previously investigated the comprehension of contrastive gestures that indexed abstract referents – in this case expressions of personal preference – and found that such gestures did facilitate the resolution of ambiguous statements of preference. In this study, we extend this work to investigate whether the effect of gesture on resolution is diminished when the gesture indexes a statement that is less likely to be interpreted as the correct referent. Participants watched videos in which a speaker contrasted two ideas that were either neutral (e.g., whether to take the train to a ballgame or drive) or moral (e.g., human cloning is (un)acceptable). A gesture to the left or right side co-occurred with speech expressing each position. In gesture-disambiguating trials, an ambiguous phrase (e.g., I agree with that, where that is ambiguous) was accompanied by a gesture to one side or the other. In gesture non-disambiguating trials, no third gesture occurred with the ambiguous phrase. Participants were more likely to choose the idea accompanied by gesture as the stimulus speaker’s preference. We found no effect of scenario type. Regardless of whether the linguistic cue expressed a view that was morally charged or neutral, observers used gesture to understand the speaker’s opinion. This finding contributes to our understanding of the strength and range of cues, both linguistic and multimodal, that listeners use to resolve ambiguous references.","Hinnell, Jennifer; Parrill, Fey",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33362652/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.587129,52

Comparing to pulling out an entire membrane tether at one time, the step-like method is more efficient because multiple relaxation curves can be obtained from one membrane tether. Fewer models describe relaxation curves to characterize mechanical properties of cell membrane. Here we establish a new method to measure the membrane relaxation curve of HeLa cells judged by the relationship between membrane tether diameter and tensions. We obtained effective viscosities and static tensions by fitting relaxation curves to our model. We noticed the delicate structure of relaxation curves contains information of cytoskeletal remodeling and lateral protein diffusion. Our study established a quantitative measure to characterize the mechanosensation of epithelial cells in response to stimulus-elicited membrane dynamics.","Li, Xuanling; Liu, Xing; Song, Xiaoyu; Li, Yinmei; Li, Ming; Wang, Haowei",J Mol Cell Biol,https://doi.org/10.1093/jmcb/mjab021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33779757/,52
613165,"CRISPR Gene Therapy: Applications, Limitations, and Implications for the Future",2020-08-07,"The SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (S protein) acquired a unique new 4 amino acid -PRRA- insertion sequence at amino acid residues (aa) 681–684 that forms a new furin cleavage site in S protein as well as several new glycosylation sites. We studied various statistical properties of the -PRRA- insertion at the RNA level (CCUCGGCGGGCA). The nucleotide composition and codon usage of this sequence are different from the rest of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. One of such features is two tandem CGG codons, although the CGG codon is the rarest codon in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. This suggests that the insertion sequence could cause ribosome pausing as the result of these rare codons. Due to population variants, the Nextstrain divergence measure of the CCU codon is extremely large. We cannot exclude that this divergence might affect host immune responses/effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, possibilities awaiting further investigation. Our experimental studies show that the expression level of original RNA sequence “wildtype” spike protein is much lower than for codon-optimized spike protein in all studied cell lines. Interestingly, the original spike sequence produces a higher titer of pseudoviral particles and a higher level of infection. Further mutagenesis experiments suggest that this dual-effect insert, comprised of a combination of overlapping translation pausing and furin sites, has allowed SARS-CoV-2 to infect its new host (human) more readily. This underlines the importance of ribosome pausing to allow efficient regulation of protein expression and also of cotranslational subdomain folding.","Postnikova, Olga A.; Uppal, Sheetal; Huang, Weiliang; Kane, Maureen A.; Villasmil, Rafael; Rogozin, Igor B.; Poliakov, Eugenia; Redmond, T.

In the present study, we analyzed the pathological changes of testes from six patients who died of SARS. Results suggested that SARS caused orchitis. All SARS testes displayed widespread germ cell destruction, few or no spermatozoon in the seminiferous tubule, thickened basement membrane, and leukocyte infiltration. The numbers of CD3+ T lymphocytes and CD68+ macrophages increased significantly in the interstitial tissue compared with the control group (P < 0.05). SARS viral genomic sequences were not detected in the testes by in situ hybridization. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated abundant IgG precipitation in the seminiferous epithelium of SARS testes, indicating possible immune response as the cause for the damage. Our findings indicated that orchitis is a complication of SARS.

Prior studies suggested that vaccine should be prioritized by age and risk groups, but few of them have considered the spatial prioritization strategy. This study aims to examine the spatial heterogeneity of COVID‐19 transmission in the city naturally, and optimize vaccine distribution strategies considering spatial prioritization. We proposed an integrated spatial model of agent‐based model and SEIR (susceptible‐exposed‐infected‐recovered). It simulated spatiotemporal process of COVID‐19 transmission in a realistic urban context. Individual movements were represented by trajectories of 8,146 randomly sampled mobile phone users on December 28, 2016 in Guangzhou, China, 90% of whom aged 18–60. Simulations were conducted under seven scenarios. Scenarios 1 and 2 examined natural spreading process of COVID‐19 and its final state of herd immunity. Scenarios 3–6 applied four vaccination strategies (random strategy, age strategy, space strategy, and space & age strategy), and identified the optimal vaccine strategy. Scenario 7 assessed the most appropriate vaccine coverage. The results demonstrates herd immunity is heterogeneously distributed in space, thus, vaccine intervention strategies should be spatialized. Among four strategies, space & age strategy is substantially most efficient, with 7.7% fewer in attack rate and 44 days longer than random strategy under 20% vaccine uptake. Space & age strategy requires 30%–40% vaccine coverage to control the epidemic, while the coverage for a random strategy is 60%–70% as a comparison. The application of our research would greatly improves the effectiveness of the vaccine usability.","Zhou, Shuli; Zhou, Suhong; Zheng, Zhong; Lu, Junwen",Geohealth,https://doi.org/10.1029/2021gh000427; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34179672/,52
614613,Mucosal Vaccines: An Overview,2007-05-09,"The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has now become a global pandemic. Coagulopathy has been reported widely in critically ill COVID-19 patients and was related to high mortality. However, the comprehensive coagulation profiles have not been examined and the underlying mechanism of the coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients is unclear. To study the coagulation profiles of routine hemostasis tests, natural anticoagulants, coagulant factors and antiphospholipid antibodies in critically ill COVID-19 patients. This single-center and cross-section study included 19 patients with COVID-19, who were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) at Tongji hospital in Wuhan, China, from Feb 23 to Mar 3, 2020. Demographic data, laboratory parameters, treatments and clinical outcomes of the patients were collected and analyzed. The final date of follow-up was Mar 31, 2020. In this study, 12 thrombotic events occurred in 9 patients, including 4 cerebral infarctions, 7 acro-ischemia and 1 internal jugular vein thrombosis. The common abnormalities of routine coagulation tests included evelated D-Dimer level (100%), prolonged prothrombin time (73.7%) and hyperfibrinogenemia (73.7%). The median activities of natural anticoagulants including protein C, protein S and antithrombin were all below the normal range. Factor VIII activities were significantly above normal range (median value 307%, IQR 198–441) in all patients. Factor V and factor VII activities were significantly lower in near-terminal stage patients. Anti-phospholipid antibodies were present in 10 patients. Strikingly, 4 cerebral infarction events were in patients had anti-phospholipid antibodies of multiple isotypes. Sustained hypercoagulable status and thrombotic events were common in critically ill patients with COVID-19. The low activities of natural anticoagulants, elevated factor VIII level and the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, together, may contribute to the etiopathology of coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients.","Zhang, Yan; Cao, Wei; Jiang, Wei; Xiao, Meng; Li, Yongzhe; Tang, Ning; Liu, Zhengyin; Yan, Xiaowei; Zhao, Yongqiang; Li, Taisheng; Zhu, Tienan",J Thromb Thrombolysis,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11239-020-02182-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32648093/,52
615285,Lipid nanoparticle encapsulated nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccines elicit polyfunctional HIV-1 antibodies comparable to proteins in nonhuman primates,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: The traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) herbal formula Lian Hua Qing Wen (LHQW) improves the results of COVID-19 treatment. Three very recent studies analyzed with network pharmacology some working mechanisms of LHQW. However, we used more techniques and also included Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (a SARS-CoV receptor, possibly the viral entry point in alveolar lung cells) and the immune system, as Cytokine storm is essential in the late phase. PURPOSE: Extensive detailed Network Pharmacology analysis of the LHQW- treatment mechanism in COVID-19. METHODS: TCM-herb-meridian and protein interaction network (PIN) of LHQW, based on LHQW herbs meridian information and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) information of the LHQW-component targets. Hub and topological property analyses to obtain crucial targets and construct the crucial LHQW-PIN. Functional modules determination using MCODE, GO and KEGG pathway analysis of biological processes and pathway enrichment. Intersection calculations between the LHQW-proteins and ACE2 co-expression-proteins. RESULTS: LHQW herbs have relationships to Stomach, Heart-, Liver- and Spleen-systems, but most (10 of the 13 herbs) to the Lung system, indicating specific effects in lung diseases. The crucial LHQW PIN has the scale-free property, contains 2,480 targets, 160,266 PPIs and thirty functional modules. Six modules are enriched in leukocyte-mediated immunity, the interferon-gamma-mediated signaling pathway, immune response regulating signaling pathway, interleukin 23 mediated signaling pathway and Fc gamma receptor-mediated phagocytosis (GO analysis). These 6 are also enriched in cancer, immune system-, and viral infection diseases (KEGG). LHQW shared 189 proteins with ACE2 co-expression proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Detailed network analysis shows, that LHQW herbal TCM treatment modulates the inflammatory process, exerts antiviral effects and repairs lung injury. Moreover, it also relieves the “cytokine storm” and improves ACE2-expression-disorder-caused symptoms. These innovative findings give a rational pharmacological basis for and support for treating COVID-19 and possibly other diseases with LHQW.","Zheng, Shichao; Baak, Jan P.; Li, Shuang; Xiao, Wenke; Ren, Hong; Yan, Huan; Gan, Yanxiong; Wen, Chuanbiao",Phytomedicine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0944711320301689; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32949888/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2020.153336; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0944711320301689?v=s5,52

These side streams are rich sources of bioactive nitrogenous compounds and protein, which can be converted into peptides through enzymatic hydrolysis as well as bacterial fermentation. Peptides are short or long chains of amino acids differing in structure and molecular weight. They can be considered as biologically active as they can contribute to physiological functions in organisms with applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries. In the food industry, such bioactive peptides can be used as preservatives or antioxidants to prevent food spoilage. Furthermore, peptides contain several functional qualities that can be exploited as tools in modifying food ingredient solubility, water-holding and fat-binding capacity and gel formation. In the pharmaceutical industry, peptides can be used as antioxidants, but also as antihypertensive, anticoagulant and immunomodulatory compounds, amongst other functions. On the basis of their properties, peptides can thus be used in the development of functional foods and nutraceuticals.

The “cytokine storm” induced by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a good target to prevent disease worsening, as indicated by the results obtained with tocilizumab and dexamethasone. SARS-CoV-2 can also invade the brain and cause neuro-inflammation with dramatic neurological manifestations, such as viral encephalitis. This could lead to potentially incapacitating long-term consequences, such as the development of psychiatric disorders, as previously observed with SARS-CoV. Several pathways/mechanisms could explain the link between viral infection and development of psychiatric diseases, especially neuro-inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, it is important to find molecules with anti-inflammatory properties that penetrate easily into the brain. For instance, some antidepressants have anti-inflammatory action and pass easily through the blood brain barrier. Among them, clomipramine has shown very strong anti-inflammatory properties in vitro, in vivo (animal models) and human studies, especially in the brain. The aim of this review is to discuss the potential application of clomipramine to prevent post-infectious mental complications. Repositioning and testing antidepressants for COVID-19 management could help to reduce peripheral and especially central inflammation and to prevent the acute and particularly the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Nobile, B.; Durand, M.; Olié, E.; Guillaume, S.; Molès, J.

We conducted a randomized controlled trial of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RT-CGM) compared with POC in a non–intensive care unit (ICU) hospital setting. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 110 adults with type 2 diabetes on a non-ICU floor received RT-CGM with Dexcom G6 versus usual care (UC). RT-CGM data were wirelessly transmitted from the bedside. Hospital telemetry monitored RT-CGM data and notified bedside nursing of glucose alerts and trends. Standardized protocols were used for interventions. RESULTS: The RT-CGM group demonstrated significantly lower mean glucose (M∆ = −18.5 mg/dL) and percentage of time in hyperglycemia >250 mg/dL (−11.41%) and higher time in range 70–250 mg/dL (+11.26%) compared with UC (P values <0.05). Percentage of time in hypoglycemia was very low. CONCLUSIONS: RT-CGM can be used successfully in community-based hospital non-ICU settings to improve glucose management.

This retrospective study included 210 elderly COVID-19 patients (aged ≥ 65 years), of whom 175 patients were discharged and 35 died. All deceased patients had at least one comorbidity. A significantly higher proportion of patients in the deceased group had cardiovascular diseases (49% vs. 20%), respiratory diseases (51% vs. 11%), chronic kidney disease (29% vs. 5%) and cerebrovascular disease (20% vs. 3%) than that in the discharged group.

AIM: We aimed to report the largest number of COVID‐19‐positive cases in KTR in a single center and to discuss their demographics, management, and evolution. METHODS: We enrolled all the two thousand KTR followed up in our center in Kuwait and collected the data of all COVID‐19‐positive KTR (104) from the start of the outbreak till the end of July 2020 and have reported the clinical features, management details, and both patient and graft outcomes. RESULTS: Out of the one hundred and four cases reported, most of them were males aged 49.3 ± 14.7 years. Eighty‐two of them needed hospitalization, of which thirty‐one were managed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Main comorbidities among these patients were hypertension in 64.4%, diabetes in 51%, and ischemic heart disease in 20.2%. Management strategies included anticoagulation in 56.7%, withdrawal of antimetabolites in 54.8%, calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) withdrawal in 33.7%, the addition of antibiotics in 57.7%, Tocilizumab in 8.7%, and antivirals in 16.3%. During a follow‐up of 30 days, the reported number of acute kidney injury (AKI) was 28.7%, respiratory failure requiring oxygen therapy 46.2%, and overall mortality rate was 10.6% with hospital mortality of 13.4% including an ICU mortality rate of 35.5%. CONCLUSION: Better outcome of COVID‐19‐positive KTR in our cohort during this unremitting stage could be due to the younger age of patients and early optimized management of anticoagulation, modification of immunosuppression, and prompt treatment of secondary bacterial infections. Mild cases can successfully be managed at home without any change in immunosuppression.","AlOtaibi, Torki M.; Gheith, Osama A.; Abuelmagd, Mohammed M.; Adel, Mohammed; Alqallaf, Ahmed K.; Elserwy, Nabil A.; Shaker, Mohamed; Abbas, Ahmad M.; Nagib, Ayman M.; Nair, Prasad; Halim, Medhat A.; Mahmoud, Tarek; khaled, Mahmoud M.; Hammad, Mohamed A.; Fayyad, Zoheer A.; Atta, Ahmed F.; Mostafa, Ahmed Y.; Draz, Ahmed S.; Zakaria, Zakaria E.; Atea, Khaled A.; Aboatya, Hasaneen H.; Ameenn, Mohamed E.; Monem, Mohamed A.; Mahmoud, Amro M.",Clin Transplant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33768630/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ctr.14297,52

This study aimed to analyze time trends in patients hospitalized for DVT and PE in France and related in-patient and 90-day post-admission mortality rates. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients hospitalized in France for DVT or PE between January and September (weeks 1-40) for each year from 2017 to 2020, were selected. Weekly incidence rate ratios (IRR) were computed to compare the rates of patients hospitalized in 2020 with those hospitalized in 2017-2019. RESULTS Compared with the 2017-2019 study period, the rates of patients hospitalized with a primary diagnosis (PD) of DVT or PE in 2020 were significantly (50 and 40%, respectively) lower during weeks 12-13. The rate of patients hospitalized with an associated diagnosis (AD) of PE during weeks 12-19 of 2020 was twice as high as in the same period in 2017-2019. The prevalence of COVID-19 in patients hospitalized with a PD of DVT and PE, and in those hospitalized with an AD of DVT and PE reached respectively 4.0, 9.6, 17.2 and 44.6 during the country's first lockdown. Inpatients case-fatality rates in patients hospitalized with an AD of PE increased significantly during weeks 12-13. CONCLUSIONS Epidemiology of VT and PE was seriously impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 in France, with a significant decrease in the rate of patients hospitalized for PE and a threefold increase in the related in-patient mortality rate.

620421,Combined approaches of EPR and NMR illustrate only one transmembrane helix in the human IFITM3,2016-04-05,"The recent outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 continues to threat and take many lives all over the world. The lack of an efficient pharmacological treatments are serious problems to be faced by scientists and medical staffs worldwide. In this work, an in silico approach based on the combination of molecular docking, dynamics simulations, and quantum biochemistry revealed that the synthetic peptides RcAlb-PepI, PepGAT, and PepKAA, strongly interact with the main protease (Mpro) a pivotal protein for SARS-CoV-2 replication. Although not binding to the proteolytic site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, RcAlb-PepI, PepGAT, and PepKAA interact with other protein domain and allosterically altered the protease topology. Indeed, such peptide-SARS-CoV-2 Mpro complexes provoked dramatic alterations in the three-dimensional structure of Mpro leading to area and volume shrinkage of the proteolytic site, which could affect the protease activity and thus the virus replication. Based on these findings, it is suggested that RcAlb-PepI, PepGAT, and PepKAA could interfere with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro role in vivo. Also, unlike other antiviral drugs, these peptides have no toxicity to human cells. This pioneering in silico investigation opens up opportunity for further in vivo research on these peptides, towards discovering new drugs and entirely new perspectives to treat COVID-19.

Passive desiccant wheels are usually applied as an energy saving technique for vapor-compression cooling systems, unburdening the cooling coil from handling the humidity of outside ventilation air stream. In contrast, active desiccant wheels are designed to promote a thorough dehumidification of outside ventilation air, many times allowing for the use of an evaporative cooler and achieving an appreciable cooling effect, using only water as the refrigerant. The present work is comprised of a comparative study of the roles played by heat and mass transfer in passive and active adsorptive air dehumidification. The adequate definition of effectiveness for desiccant wheels is also discussed.","Nóbrega, C.E.L.; Brum, N.C.L.",Energy Build,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288122/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2012.03.049; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378778812001983; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778812001983,52

Adopting a socio-ecological perspective, this study investigated the influence of stress arising from political life events, intrapersonal factors (i.e., meaning in life, resilience), interpersonal factors (i.e., social support, associational social capital), and community factors (i.e., perceived empowerment in the community, perceived opportunities for civic engagement) on the mental health of youth in Hong Kong. Furthermore, it examined the moderating effects of these factors on the relationship between stress arising from political life events and mental health. A cross-sectional quantitative survey with a stratified purposive sampling data collection method was conducted. A total of 1330 secondary school students were recruited for this study. Multiple regression analysis was performed to examine both direct and moderation effects. The results indicate that high stress arising from political life events, low meaningfulness in life, low resilience, low social support, low youth empowerment in the community, and high civic engagement in the community were related to high mental distress. None of the presumed moderators moderated the relationship between stress due to political life events and mental distress.

621822,Targeting the Integrated Stress Response Kinase GCN2 to Modulate Retroviral Integration,2021-09-06,"Link prediction in artificial intelligence is used to identify missing links or derive future relationships that can occur in complex networks. A link prediction model was developed using the complex heterogeneous biomedical knowledge graph, SemNet, to predict missing links in biomedical literature for drug discovery. A web application visualized knowledge graph embeddings and link prediction results using TransE, CompleX, and RotatE based methods. The link prediction model achieved up to 0.44 hits@10 on the entity prediction tasks. The recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as COVID-19, served as a case study to demonstrate the efficacy of link prediction modeling for drug discovery. The link prediction algorithm guided identification and ranking of repurposed drug candidates for SARS-CoV-2 primarily by text mining biomedical literature from previous coronaviruses, including SARS and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS). Repurposed drugs included potential primary SARS-CoV-2 treatment, adjunctive therapies, or therapeutics to treat side effects. The link prediction accuracy for nodes ranked highly for SARS coronavirus was 0.875 as calculated by human in the loop validation on existing COVID-19 specific data sets. Drug classes predicted as highly ranked include anti-inflammatory, nucleoside analogs, protease inhibitors, antimalarials, envelope proteins, and glycoproteins. Examples of highly ranked predicted links to SARS-CoV-2: human leukocyte interferon, recombinant interferon-gamma, cyclosporine, antiviral therapy, zidovudine, chloroquine, vaccination, methotrexate, artemisinin, alkaloids, glycyrrhizic acid, quinine, flavonoids, amprenavir, suramin, complement system proteins, fluoroquinolones, bone marrow transplantation, albuterol, ciprofloxacin, quinolone antibacterial agents, and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors. Approximately 40% of identified drugs were not previously connected to SARS, such as edetic acid or biotin. In summary, link prediction can effectively suggest repurposed drugs for emergent diseases.","McCoy, Kevin; Gudapati, Sateesh; He, Lawrence; Horlander, Elaina; Kartchner, David; Kulkarni, Soham; Mehra, Nidhi; Prakash, Jayant; Thenot, Helena; Vanga, Sri Vivek; Wagner, Abigail; White, Brandon; Mitchell, Cassie S.",Pharmaceutics,https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics13060794; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34073456/,52

In this study we retrospectively reviewed the clinical and laboratory characteristics of 18 COVID-19 patients from January 30, 2020 to February 21, 2020. These patients were divided into two groups; group 1 had a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 nucleic acid-positive duration for more than 15 days (n = 6) and group 2 had a nucleic acid-positive duration for less than 15 days (n = 12). Group 1 patients had lower level of peripheral blood lymphocytes (0.40 vs. 0.78 ×10(9)/L, p = 0.024) and serum potassium (3.36 vs. 3.79 mmol/L, p = 0.043) on admission but longer hospitalization days (23.17 vs. 15.75 days, p < 0.001) compared to Group 2 patients. Moreover, baseline level of lymphocytes (r = -0.62, p = 0.006) was negatively correlated with the nucleic acid-positive duration.

623938,"A Comprehensive Review of Common Bacterial, Parasitic and Viral Zoonoses at the Human-Animal Interface in Egypt",2017-07-21,"BACKGROUND: Little evidence is available on the use of telehealth for antenatal care. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed and implemented a new antenatal care schedule integrating telehealth across all models of pregnancy care. To inform this clinical initiative, we aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of telehealth in antenatal care. METHODS: We analysed routinely collected health data on all women giving birth at Monash Health, a large health service in Victoria (Australia), using an interrupted time-series design. We assessed the impact of telehealth integration into antenatal care from March 23, 2020, across low-risk and high-risk care models. Allowing a 1-month implementation period from March 23, 2020, we compared the first 3 months of telehealth integrated care delivered between April 20 and July 26, 2020, with conventional care delivered between Jan 1, 2018, and March 22, 2020. The primary outcomes were detection and outcomes of fetal growth restriction, pre-eclampsia, and gestational diabetes. Secondary outcomes were stillbirth, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and preterm birth (birth before 37 weeks' gestation). FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2018, and March 22, 2020, 20 031 women gave birth at Monash Health during the conventional care period and 2292 women gave birth during the telehealth integrated care period. Of 20 154 antenatal consultations provided in the integrated care period, 10 731 (53%) were delivered via telehealth. Overall, compared with the conventional care period, no significant differences were identified in the integrated care period with regard to the number of babies with fetal growth restriction (birthweight below the 3rd percentile; 2% in the integrated care period vs 2% in the conventional care period, p=0·72, for low-risk care models; 5% in the integrated care period vs 5% in the conventional care period, p=0·50 for high-risk care models), number of stillbirths (1% vs 1%, p=0·79; 2% vs 2%, p=0·70), or pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia (3% vs 3%, p=0·70; 9% vs 7%, p=0·15), or gestational diabetes (22% vs 22%, p=0·89; 30% vs 26%, p=0·06). Interrupted time-series analysis showed a significant reduction in preterm birth among women in high-risk models (–0·68% change in incidence per week [95% CI −1·37 to −0·002]; p=0·049), but no significant differences were identified in other outcome measures for low-risk or high-risk care models after telehealth integration compared with conventional care. INTERPRETATION: Telehealth integrated antenatal care enabled the reduction of in-person consultations by 50% without compromising pregnancy outcomes. This care model can help to minimise in-person interactions during the COVID-19 pandemic, but should also be considered in post-pandemic health-care models.

Here, we show that Xoo-induced rice leaf blight is effectively controlled by niclosamide, an oral antihelminthic drug and molluscicide, which also functions as an anti-tumor agent. Niclosamide directly inhibited the growth of the three Xoo strains PXO99, 10208 and K3a. Niclosamide moved long distances from the site of local application to distant rice tissues. Niclosamide also increased the levels of salicylate and induced the expression of defense-related genes such as OsPR1 and OsWRKY45, which suppressed Xoo-induced leaf wilting. Niclosamide had no detrimental effects on vegetative/reproductive growth and yield. These combined results indicate that niclosamide can be used to block bacterial leaf blight in rice with no negative side effects.","Kim, Sung-Il; Song, Jong Tae; Jeong, Jin-Yong; Seo, Hak Soo",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/srep21209; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26879887/,52

It is well demonstrated that malnutrition is related to worse outcomes in acute and chronic diseases. During this sanitary emergency the Clinical Nutrition Unit in Bologna developed an early nutrition protocol for hospital ad home COVID-19 patients. Methods and procedures Recently published recommendations regarding nutritional needs in COVID-19 patients and general Clinical Nutrition Guidelines were searched on PubMed. Results The hospital algorithm considered three different steps: oral feeding, enteral feeding and parenteral nutrition, recommending early nutrition therapy (within 24-48 hours of hospitalization). We arranged a modified oral ""COVID diet"" consisting in soft or creamy hypercaloric-hyperproteic meals in disposable packages . As far as artificial nutrition is concerned we chose hypercaloric, high-protein Oral Nutrition Supplements (ONS), enteral formulas and parenteral formulas, all enriched with EPA and DHA. Due to high micronutrients requirements each patient was recommended high-dose uniparenteral vitamin D and thiamine. For home COVID-19 patients screening using NRS-2003 was recommended: for those at low nutritional risk we provided general nutritional advice; for those at intermediate risk we suggested a dietitian consultation for personalized nutritional plan or ONS prescription. For those at high nutritional risk the nutritionist physician evaluation was suggested for disease-specific ONS or artificial nutrition prescription. All patients were suggested vitamin D 2000 IU / day and a multivitamin supplement. Conclusion During COVID-19 pandemic continuous clinical updating and adaptation to new clinical settings helped to develop an Early Nutrition Protocol for fast nutritional assessment and treatment in a large number of patients and emergency conditions.","Bursi, S.; Anzolin, F.; Natale, S.; Onfiani, G.; Morisi, L.; Tommesani, G.; Corradini, B.; Valeriani, L.",Nutrition,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0899900721001957; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899900721001957,52

Although mixed liver impairment has been reported in COVID-19 patients, the association of liver injury caused by specific subtype especially chronic hepatitis B (CHB) with COVID-19 has not been elucidated. In this multi-center, retrospective, and observational cohort study, 109 CHB and 327 non-CHB patients with COVID-19 were propensity score matched at an approximate ratio of 3:1 on the basis of age, sex, and comorbidities. Demographic characteristics, laboratory examinations, disease severity, and clinical outcomes were compared. Furthermore, univariable and multivariable logistic and Cox regression models were used to explore the risk factors for disease severity and mortality, respectively. A higher proportion of CHB patients (30 of 109 (27.52%)) developed into severe status than non-CHB patients (17 of 327 (5.20%)). In addition to previously reported liver impairment markers, such as alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin, we identified several novel risk factors including elevated lactate dehydrogenase (⩾ 245 U/L, hazard ratio (HR) = 8.639, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.528–29.523; P < 0.001) and coagulation-related biomarker D-dimer (⩾ 0.5 µg/mL, HR = 4.321, 95% CI = 1.443–12.939; P = 0.009) and decreased albumin (< 35 g/L, HR = 0.131, 95% CI = 0.048–0.361; P < 0.001) and albumin/globulin ratio (< 1.5, HR = 0.123, 95% CI = 0.017–0.918; P = 0.041). In conclusion, COVID-19 patients with CHB were more likely to develop into severe illness and die.

Moreover, lung cells that have ACE2 expression may be the main target cells during 2019-nCoV infection. However, some patients also exhibit non-respiratory symptoms, such as kidney failure, implying that 2019-nCoV could also invade other organs. To construct a risk map of different human organs, we analyzed the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets derived from major human physiological systems, including the respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive, and urinary systems. Through scRNA-seq data analyses, we identified the organs at risk, such as lung, heart, esophagus, kidney, bladder, and ileum, and located specific cell types (i.e., type II alveolar cells (AT2), myocardial cells, proximal tubule cells of the kidney, ileum and esophagus epithelial cells, and bladder urothelial cells), which are vulnerable to 2019-nCoV infection. Based on the findings, we constructed a risk map indicating the vulnerability of different organs to 2019-nCoV infection.

Social Workers are a potential resource to create such initiatives and projects that promote inclusion and cohesion within communities, a protective factor against suicide. Sixty-two Social Work BA students participated in a Death Education course based on education on suicide prevention. Participants carried out two activities. First, they were invited to complete two written semi-structured interviews on young people’s reasons for living and dying. Second, they were invited to design suicide prevention interventions targeted at their peers and adolescents. Data were analyzed qualitatively within the Thematic Analysis framework. As regards the first activity, four main themes were identified: (1) Internet and social media; (2) social isolation and loneliness; (3) the importance of proximal relationships; and, (4) the importance of networking between proximal relationships, educational institutions and mental health services. Whereas, as for suicide prevention interventions, three main ideas were identified: (1) suicide prevention through community and networking between services; (2) academic institutions: high schools and universities; and, (3) suicide prevention through new technologies.

Methods Data from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) were used to estimate age- and sex-specific CFRs for COVID-19 in South Korea up until the 12th June 2020. We applied statistical methods previously developed to adjust for the delay between diagnosis and death and presented both delay-adjusted and crude (unadjusted) CFRs throughout the epidemic. Results The overall estimated delay-adjusted CFR was 2.39% (3.05% for males and 1.92% for females). Within each age strata where deaths were reported, we found males had significantly higher CFRs than females. The estimated CFRs increased substantially from age 60 years in males and from 70 years in females. We found that both the delay-adjusted CFRs and crude CFRs evolved substantially, particularly early in the epidemic, converging only from mid-April 2020. Conclusions The CFRs for South Korea provide an estimate of mortality risk in a setting where case ascertainment is likely to be more complete.

Different factors have been studied but the potential influence of pathogens has never been investigated. Sex differences especially in hormones and resource allocation generate a differential response to pathogens and thereby shape sex differences in lifespan or aging. We provide an integrative framework linking host pathogenic environment with both sex-specific selections on immune performance and mortality trajectories. We propose future directions to fill existing knowledge gaps about mechanisms that link sex differences, not only to exposition and sensitivity to pathogens, but also to mortality patterns, whilst emphasizing the urgent need to consider the role of sex in medicine.","Tidière, Morgane; Badruna, Adèle; Fouchet, David; Gaillard, Jean-Michel; Lemaître, Jean-François; Pontier, Dominique",Trends Parasitol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32540194/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S147149222030132X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147149222030132X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pt.2020.05.004,52

The investment trajectory or glide-path for a representative set of 14 assets of heterogeneous characteristics is studied during a 161 quarters long horizon. The expected returns are estimated by the GARCH(1,1), EGARCH(1,1), GJR-GARCH(1,1) models, and a stationary block bootstrap model is used as a benchmark for comparison. A fixed historical covariance matrix and a multi-period estimation of DCC-GARCH(1,1) are also considered as inputs of the objective function. Forecasts are evaluated through their asymmetric dependencies as quantified by the transfer entropy measure. In general, we find very similar glide-paths so that the overall structure of the investment is maintained and does not rely on the particular forecasting model. However, the GARCH(1,1) under a fixed historical covariance matrix exhibits the highest Sharpe ratio and in this sense represents the best trade-off between wealth and risk. As expected, the initial stages of the obtained glide-paths are initially dominated by risky assets and gradually transition into bonds towards the end oof the trajectory. Overall, the methodology proposed here is computationally efficient and displays the desired properties of a TDF strategy in realistic settings.","García-Medina, Andrés; Hernández-Leandro, Norberto A.; González Farías, Graciela; Muriel, Nelson",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249857; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33848313/,52

The disease’s novelty and severity have elicited a range of attitudes and perspectives countrywide, which consequently influence the public’s adherence to public health prevention and treatment guidelines. AIM: To investigate perceptions, experiences and knowledge on COVID-19 in a community-based cohort study. SETTING: Adults living in Soweto in South Africa’s Gauteng province during the first six weeks of the national lockdown regulations (i.e. Alert Level 5 lockdown from end of March to beginning of May 2020). METHODS: Participants completed a series of surveys and answered open-ended questions through telephonic interviews (n = 391). We queried their perceptions of the origins of COVID-19, understandings of the disease, personal and communal risks and its relations with the existing disease burden. RESULTS: Findings from our sample of 391 adults show that perceptions and knowledge of COVID-19 vary across several demographic characteristics. We report moderate levels of understanding about COVID-19, prevention methods and risk, as well as exposure to major physical, psychosocial and financial stressors. Depressive symptoms, perceived infection risk and concern about COVID-19 significantly predicted COVID-19 prevention knowledge. CONCLUSION: Public health communication campaigns should focus on continuing to improve knowledge and reduce misinformation associated with the virus. Policymakers should consider the mental health- and non-health-related impact of the pandemic on their citizens in order to curb the pandemic in a manner that maximises well-being.","Kim, Andrew W.; Burgess, Raquel; Chiwandire, Nicola; Kwinda, Zwannda; Tsai, Alexander C.; Norris, Shane A.; Mendenhall, Emily",S Afr J Psychiatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34230864/; https://doi.org/10.4102/sajpsychiatry.27i0.1580,52

The objective of this review was to systematically explore how music therapists previously working in-person adapted to the transfer to remote forms of therapy in the context of the coronavirus outbreak. Methods: We searched Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, CINAHL, Medline, ProQuest Central, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and PsyARTICLES, grey literature (to October 2020), and websites of professional organizations. We followed the JBI methodology for scoping reviews. Results: Out of the 194 screened texts, we included ten very heterogeneous articles with an overall very low quality. Most texts described remote therapy in the form of synchronous video calls using the Internet, one paper described a concert in a patio of a residential home. We report the authors’ experience with the adaptation and activities, challenges and benefits of remote forms of therapy, recommendations of organizations, and examples and tips for online therapies. Conclusions: Music therapists have adapted the musical instruments, the hours, the technology used, the therapeutic goals, the way they prepared their clients for sessions, and other aspects. They needed to be more flexible, consult with colleagues more often, and mind the client-therapist relationship’s boundaries. It seems, when taken as a necessary short-term measure, online music therapy works sufficiently well.

Many elective and non-essential surgeries were postponed worldwide in an effort to minimize spread of disease as well as to conserve resources. Our goal with this article is to review current practice guidelines in setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, based on available data and literature. METHODS: Websites pertaining to surgical and medical societies, and government agencies were reviewed, along with recently published literature to identify recommendations related to COVID-19 and plastic surgery procedures. RESULTS: Clinical practice modifications are recommended during the pandemic, in outpatient and perioperative settings. Use of personal protective equipment is critical for aerosol generating procedures such as surgery in the head and neck area. Care for trauma and malignancy should continue during the pandemic, however definitive reconstruction could be delayed for select cases. Specific recommendations were made for surgical treatment of cancer, trauma and semi-urgent reconstructive procedures based on available data and literature. CONCLUSION: The risk and benefit of each reconstructive procedure should be carefully analyzed in relation to necessary patient care, minimized COVID-19 spread, protection of health care personnel and utilization of resources. Recommendations in this manuscript should be taken in the context of each institute’s resources and prevalance of COVID-19 in the region. It should be emphasized that the guidelines provided are a snapshot of current practices and are subject to change as the pandemic continues to evolve.","Ozturk, Cemile Nurdan; Kuruoglu, Doga; Ozturk, Can; Rampazzo, Antonio; Gurunian (Gurunluoglu), Raffi",Ann Plast Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32358230/; https://doi.org/10.1097/sap.0000000000002443,52
634459,In vitro and ex vivo systems at the forefront of infection modeling and drug discovery,2019-04-30,"An imaging system has natural statistics that reflect its intrinsic characteristics. For example, the gradient histogram of a visible light image generally obeys a heavy-tailed distribution, and its restoration considers natural statistics. Thermal imaging cameras detect infrared radiation, and their signal processors are specialized according to the optical and sensor systems. Thermal images, also known as long wavelength infrared (LWIR) images, suffer from distinct degradations of LWIR sensors and residual nonuniformity (RNU). However, despite the existence of various studies on the statistics of thermal images, thermal image processing has seldom attempted to incorporate natural statistics. In this study, natural statistics of thermal imaging sensors are derived, and an optimization method for restoring thermal images is proposed. To verify our hypothesis about the thermal images, high-frequency components of thermal images from various datasets are analyzed with various measures (correlation coefficient, histogram intersection, chi-squared test, Bhattacharyya distance, and Kullback–Leibler divergence), and generalized properties are derived. Furthermore, cost functions accommodating the validated natural statistics are designed and minimized by a pixel-wise optimization method. The proposed algorithm has a specialized structure for thermal images and outperforms the conventional methods. Several image quality assessments are employed for quantitatively demonstrating the performance of the proposed method. Experiments with synthesized images and real-world images are conducted, and the results are quantified by reference image assessments (peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index measure) and no-reference image assessments (Roughness (Ro) and Effective Roughness (ERo) indices).","Han, Jaeduk; Lee, Haegeun; Kang, Moon Gi",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s21165443; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34450885/,52
634655,An Antigenic Thrift-Based Approach to Influenza Vaccine Design,2021-06-16,"BACKGROUND The clinical onset serial interval, or the time between the onset of symptoms in successive cases in a chain of infection, is often used as a measurable proxy for the transmission serial interval of an infectious disease. Current estimates of the mean clinical onset serial interval of COVID-19 range from 3.96 to 7.5 days. In this article, we define the diagnostic serial interval as the time between the diagnosis dates of the infector and infectee. We study and compare the clinical onset and diagnostic serial intervals of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 in South Korea. METHODS Analyzing the DS4C project data which summarize information on SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 cases reported by regional governments in South Korea, we estimate the means of the clinical onset serial interval, the diagnostic serial interval and the difference between the two. We use the balanced cluster bootstrap method to construct 95% bootstrap confidence intervals. RESULTS The mean clinical onset serial interval and mean diagnostic serial interval were estimated to be 3.58 days (95% CI: 2.62, 4.53) and 3.68 days (95% CI: 3.14, 4.22), respectively. A matched sample analysis showed that the diagnostic serial interval was significantly shorter than the clinical onset serial interval (estimated mean difference -1.17 days, 95% CI: -2.26, -0.09). CONCLUSIONS The short diagnostic serial interval of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 in South Korea may explain why South Korea was able to contain the COVID-19 outbreak and avoid high mortality. We conjecture that the mean diagnostic serial interval may serve as a predictor for the success of a country's containment efforts.","Mettler, S. K.; Maathuis, M.

Although less sensitive than molecular detection methods, rapid antigen testing offers the potential for inexpensive, quick, decentralized testing. Robust analytical sensitivity data in comparison to reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) are currently lacking for many rapid antigen tests. Here, we evaluated the analytical sensitivity of the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag card using SARS-CoV-2-positive clinical specimens quantified by reverse transcription-droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) and multiple FDA EUA qRT-PCR platforms using RNA standards. Initial and confirmatory limits of detection for the BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag card were determined to be equivalent to 4.04 × 10(4) to 8.06 × 10(4) copies/swab. We further confirmed this limit of detection with 72 additional clinical samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 in either phosphate-buffered saline or viral transport medium. One hundred percent of samples with viral loads of >40,000 copies/swab were detected by rapid antigen testing.

635854,Coronavirus-induced demyelination occurs in the absence of CD28 costimulatory signals,2003-12-22,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The majority of the UK’s leisure horses are kept at livery yards, under the oversight of a livery yard manager or owner. Livery yard managers/owners therefore have a major impact on the potential wellbeing of horses within each yard, but their role has not been previously studied. This study used the COVID-19 pandemic as a lens to view the priorities and decisions of livery yard managers at a time when everything was already subject to change. Yard managers/owners of 24 very diverse yards were interviewed over a period of nine months, repeating interviews quarterly. Discussion forum threads on relevant topics about livery yards during COVID-19 were also collected. These data were analysed using a qualitative approach called Grounded Theory. The results showed that running a yard required a careful balance between conflicting priorities, which made change difficult within each individual yard culture. During the pandemic, maintaining usual horse care routines and standards was prioritised above human health and the business model of the yard, and above horse–human relationships. However, each yard adopted individual approaches to managing human health alongside maintaining equine management. These findings are important for future initiatives which aim to support livery yard management and change. ABSTRACT: Approximately 60% of the UK’s leisure horses are kept at livery yards under the management and oversight of a livery yard owner or manager (LYO/M), yet their role has received little research attention. This study used the COVID-19 pandemic as a lens through which to view LYO/Ms’ decisions around equine care and management at a time when changes to usual practice were necessary. Qualitative research methods were used. Up to 3 interviews were conducted with 24 different LYO/Ms over nine months (n = 48). Discussion threads from open-access UK discussion fora were also analysed. All data were anonymised and analysed using a Grounded Theory methodology. Prior to the pandemic, equine care and management practices varied greatly across yards, and yard cultures were a product of LYO/Ms’ construction of good equine care, their business model, and the need to balance human and equine contentment. The role of the LYO/M was to maintain an equilibrium between those interlinked factors. During the pandemic, LYO/Ms adopted new measures designed to influence the movement of horse owners and other people on yards to minimise the risk of COVID-19 transmission. During this time, LYO/Ms reported prioritising equine wellbeing by limiting change to equine routines and management wherever possible. Instead of altering equine management, there was an expectation that the lives of humans would be moulded and re-shaped to fit with the government COVID-19 guidelines. These results highlight the importance of routines, traditions and cultures in each individual yard. Maintaining the standard of care for the horse was prioritised regardless of who provided that care.","Furtado, Tamzin; Perkins, Elizabeth; McGowan, Catherine; Pinchbeck, Gina",Animals (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11051416; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34069277/,52
635994,Implication of Dietary Iron-Chelating Bioactive Compounds in Molecular Mechanisms of Oxidative Stress-Induced Cell Ageing,2021-03-21,"BACKGROUND: Exposure to poor air quality leads to increased premature mortality from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Among the far-reaching implications of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a substantial improvement in air quality was observed worldwide after the lockdowns imposed by many countries. We aimed to assess the implications of different lockdown measures on air pollution levels in Europe and China, as well as the short-term and long-term health impact. METHODS: For this modelling study, observations of fine particulate matter (PM(2·5)) concentrations from more than 2500 stations in Europe and China during 2016–20 were integrated with chemical transport model simulations to reconstruct PM(2·5) fields at high spatiotemporal resolution. The health benefits, expressed as short-term and long-term avoided mortality from PM(2·5) exposure associated with the interventions imposed to control the COVID-19 pandemic, were quantified on the basis of the latest epidemiological studies. To explore the long-term variability in air quality and associated premature mortality, we built different scenarios of economic recovery (immediate or gradual resumption of activities, a second outbreak in autumn, and permanent lockdown for the whole of 2020). FINDINGS: The lockdown interventions led to a reduction in population-weighted PM(2·5) of 14·5 μg m(−3) across China (−29·7%) and 2·2 μg m(−3) across Europe (−17·1%), with unprecedented reductions of 40 μg m(−3) in bimonthly mean PM(2·5) in the areas most affected by COVID-19 in China. In the short term, an estimated 24 200 (95% CI 22 380–26 010) premature deaths were averted throughout China between Feb 1 and March 31, and an estimated 2190 (1960–2420) deaths were averted in Europe between Feb 21 and May 17. We also estimated a positive number of long-term avoided premature fatalities due to reduced PM(2·5) concentrations, ranging from 76 400 (95% CI 62 600–86 900) to 287 000 (233 700–328 300) for China, and from 13 600 (11 900–15 300) to 29 500 (25 800–33 300) for Europe, depending on the future scenarios of economic recovery adopted. INTERPRETATION: These results indicate that lockdown interventions led to substantial reductions in PM(2·5) concentrations in China and Europe. We estimated that tens of thousands of premature deaths from air pollution were avoided, although with significant differences observed in Europe and China. Our findings suggest that considerable improvements in air quality are achievable in both China and Europe when stringent emission control policies are adopted.

Results: During early outbreak, female HCWs were more likely to give greater attention, adjusted OR:1.92 (95%CI 1.14–3.23) in total HCWs. Higher proportion of anxiety was observed in female HCWs, adjusted OR:3.14 (95%CI 1.98–4.99) for total HCWs, 4.32(95%CI 1.32–14.15) for infected HCWs and 2.97 (1.78, 4.95) for uninfected HCWs. Proportion of pessimism, fear, full of fighting spirit, and optimism were low, and no gender differences were observed. During a later outbreak, a majority of HCWs reported being very familiar with eight protective measures. After training, a proportion of high self-evaluation in hand hygiene, wearing gloves, and surgical masks increased independently in female HCWs, and adjusted ORs were 3.07 (95% CI 1.57–5.99), 2.37 (95% CI 1.26–4.49), and 1.92 (95% CI 1.02–3.62), respectively. Infection status amplified gender difference in anxiety, hand hygiene, and glove wearing. Conclusion: Female HCWs perceived the outbreak seriously, effective emotional and psychological well-ness should be targeted at female HCWs preferentially, and male HCWs should be encouraged to express their feelings and be further trained.","Huang, Qiao; Luo, Li-Sha; Wang, Yun-Yun; Jin, Ying-Hui; Zeng, Xian-Tao",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.638975; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33777887/,52

These conditions play an important role in the worsening of clinical symptoms in patients with severe COVID-19. There is no established treatment for hypercytokinemia. We report on two patients whose clinical symptoms improved after direct hemoperfusion using polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column (PMX-DHP), following the administration of the anti-inflammatory agent tocilizumab. Case A was a 70-year-old man diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. Despite treatment with ciclesonide and favipiravir, supplemental oxygen was administered due to the worsening of dyspnea with tachypnea. Although tocilizumab was started on day 6, the patient deteriorated into deoxygenation, presenting with the PaO(2)/F(I)O(2) (P/F) ratio of 92. On days 8 and 10, the patient received PMX-DHP therapy. On day 11, his dyspnea improved. On day 13, his P/F ratio began to improve, and oxygen therapy was discontinued on day 18. The patient recovered without requiring mechanical ventilation. Case B was a 70-year-old man diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and treated with favipiravir, starting on day 0. Despite starting ciclesonide inhalation and tocilizumab on day 2, his P/F ratio was 53. On day 5, he received PMX-DHP therapy. On day 6, his dyspnea improved, as did his P/F ratio, reaching 81 on day 8. Finally, his clinical symptoms resolved, and he was discharged from the intensive care unit without requiring mechanical ventilation. These cases indicate that PMX-DHP therapy might be a suitable treatment option for dyspnea and deoxygenation in COVID-19 pneumonia, especially in cases where an anti-inflammatory agent, such as tocilizumab, has failed to achieve the desired effect.","Kuwana, Tsukasa; Kinoshita, Kosaku; Hirabayashi, Marina; Ihara, Shingo; Sawada, Nami; Mutoh, Tomokazu; Yamaguchi, Junko",Infect Drug Resist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33854342/; https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s299023,52

Hospital-based surveillance is paramount to monitor the severity of a disease in the population. METHODS: Two separate surveillance systems, a Surge Capacity survey and a Clinical survey, were set up to collect complementary data on COVID-19 from Belgium’s hospitals. The Surge Capacity survey collects aggregated data to monitor the hospital capacity through occupancy rates of beds and medical devices, and to follow a set of key epidemiological indicators over time. Participation is mandatory and the daily data collection includes prevalence and incidence figures on the number of COVID-19 patients in the hospital. The Clinical survey is strongly recommended by health authorities, focusses on specific patient characteristics and relies on individual patient data provided by the hospitals at admission and discharge. CONCLUSIONS: This national double-level hospital surveillance was implemented very rapidly after the first COVID-19 patients were hospitalized and revealed to be crucial to monitor hospital capacity over time and to better understand the disease in terms of risk groups and outcomes. The two approaches are complementary and serve different needs.

Identifying patients with a higher probability of infection becomes crucial in settings with limited access to testing. We developed a prediction instrument to assess the likelihood of a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, based solely on clinical variables that can be determined within the time frame of an emergency department (ED) patient encounter. METHODS: We derived and prospectively validated a model to predict SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity in patients visiting the ED with symptoms consistent with the disease. RESULTS: Our model was based on 617 ED visits. In the derivation cohort, the median age was 36 years, 43% were men, and 9% had a positive result. The median time to testing from the onset of initial symptoms was four days (interquartile range [IQR]: 2–5 days, range 0–23 days), and 91% of all patients were discharged home. The final model based on a multivariable logistic regression included a history of close contact (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.47, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.29–4.7); fever (AOR 3.63, 95% CI, 1.931–6.85); anosmia or dysgeusia (AOR 9.7, 95% CI, 2.72–34.5); headache (AOR 1.95, 95% CI, 1.06–3.58), myalgia (AOR 2.6, 95% CI, 1.39–4.89); and dry cough (AOR 1.93, 95% CI, 1.02–3.64). The area under the curve (AUC) from the derivation cohort was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.73–0.85) and AUC 0.7 (95% CI, 0.61–0.75) in the validation cohort (N = 379). CONCLUSION: We developed and validated a clinical tool to predict SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity in patients presenting to the ED to assist with patient disposition in environments where COVID-19 tests or timely results are not readily available.","Lara, Barbara A.; Torres, Francisco; Holger, Patricia; Perales, Claudia; Basauri, Sofia; Clausdorff, Hans; Escobedo, Ernesto; Saldias, Fernando; Swadron, Stuart; Aguilera, Pablo",West J Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.5811/westjem.2020.12.49200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34125032/,52

Only recently, rapid testing appeared as a new policy instrument. If sufficiently effective, it may serve as a substitute for contact restrictions. Against this background we evaluate the effects of a unique policy experiment: on March 16, the city of Tuebingen set up a rapid testing scheme while relaxing lockdown measures-in sharp contrast to its German peers. Comparing case rates in Tuebingen county to an appropriately defined control unit over a four-week period, we find an increase in the reported case rate, robustly across alternative specifications. However, the increase is temporary and about one half of it reflects cases that would have gone undetected in the absence of extra testing.","Diederichs, M.; Kremsner, P.; Mitze, T.; Schulz, F.; Mueller, G.

Therefore, our aim was to study whether prenatal exposure to PD is related to early infant HPA axis reactivity in the context of a subclinical rhinovirus infection that challenges infants HPA axis postnatally. Methods This study included 336 10-week-old infants from the nested case control Focus Cohort of the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study. The outcome was infant HPA axis reactivity in a stress test. The acute stressor comprised of pediatric examination with venipuncture and nasal swabs for virus assessment. Saliva cortisol samples were collected at 5 time points: baseline, 0, 15, 25 and 35 min after the stressor. HPA axis reactivity was defined by the cumulative post-stressor cortisol concentration. Results HPA axis reactivity was blunted in the PD/rhinovirus + group compared to the average of control/rhinovirus+, PD/rhinovirus-, and control/rhinovirus- groups (difference: 14.7 ln [nmol/L] × min, 95% confidence interval 3.8–25.6, p = .008). HPA axis reactivity was significantly blunted only in boys with rhinovirus detected when separately tested for boys and girls (p = .04). Conclusion Our finding of PD-exposed rhinovirus-positive infants having blunted cortisol secretion gives rise to a hypothesis that maternal PD during pregnancy influences infant HPA axis functioning and the functioning of the immune system. Future studies are needed to test whether this suppression of the HPA axis that co-occurs with rhinovirus infection associates with later disease development (e.g., asthma).","Korhonen, Laura S.; Kortesluoma, Susanna; Lukkarinen, Minna; Peltola, Ville; Pesonen, Henri; Pelto, Juho; Tuulari, Jetro J.; Lukkarinen, Heikki; Vuorinen, Tytti; Karlsson, Hasse; Karlsson, Linnea",Psychoneuroendocrinology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31146139/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306453018310722; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2019.05.023; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306453018310722,52

For the skin bank set-up, pertinent issues related to legislation, methods, logistics, quality assurance and donation rate are discussed. In this retrospective review, a comparison between patients who had early complete excision with skin allograft transplantation and those who received conventional staged excision and coverage, was analysed in terms of clinical profile and outcome using statistical methods. The former group presented a significant reduction of mortality rate and hospital stay by 29% and 10 days, respectively. The establishment of the skin bank has helped in the management of severe burn patients by facilitating early excision and allografting.

In this paper, a stochastic rumor-spreading model with Holling II functional response function considering the existence of time delay and the disturbance of white noise is proposed. Firstly, the existence of a unique global positive solution of the model is studied. Then the asymptotic behavior of the global solution around the rumor-free and rumor-local equilibrium nodes of the deterministic system is discussed. Finally, through some numerical results, the validity and availability of theoretical analysis is verified powerfully, and it shows that some factors such as the transmission rate, the intensity of white noise, and the time delay have significant relationship with the dynamical behavior of rumor spreading.","Huo, Liang’an; Chen, Xiaomin",Adv Differ Equ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33250927/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13662-020-03096-9,52

We aimed to describe the clinical and laboratory findings of HLH patients secondary to Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and their treatment outcome during a 4-year follow-up period compared to primary HLH. METHOD: Forty children with primary HLH confirmed by genetic study and 20 children with HLH secondary to VL confirmed by a blood or bone marrow polymerase chain reaction from 2014 to 2018 in Shiraz, Fars province, Southern Iran, were enrolled. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 11.5 months (range 1–170), and 56.7% were male. Fever and splenomegaly were the most frequent clinical presentations. 93.3% of the subjects had an HScore > 169, which had a good correlation with HLH-2004 criteria (r = 0.371, P = 0.004). Patients with primary HLH experienced more thrombocytopenia (P = 0.012) and higher alanine transaminase (P = 0.016), while patients with VL-associated HLH had higher ferritin (P = 0.034) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P = 0.011). Central nervous system (CNS) involvement occurred in 38.3% of patients. The mortality rate was higher in patients with CNS disease (61% vs. 35%, P = 0.051). The 3-yr overall survival rate was 35.9%.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A specific questionnaire was developed and made available online from March 18th to 20th 2020. Dentists working in Spain were invited to answer. Questions were divided in 4 sections: demographic data and professional activity; specific information on COVID-19 and opinion about the decisions taken by Dental Councils and Health Authorities; risk assessment for SARS-CoV-2 in dental practices; and implementation of new ways of working. Chi-square tests were computed (p<0.05). 873 dentists answered the survey.

However, the qualification of polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofiber mesh cloth in face masks to protect individuals against airborne particles carrying microorganisms has yet to be investigated. The long-term goal of this study is to develop methods to use PCL nanofiber mesh to provide better protection against microorganisms. To achieve this goal, we observed the morphology, water droplet absorption, thermal (differential scanning calorimetry), mechanical, and airborne particle filtering capabilities, and also the microbial activities of a PCL cloth, to evaluate whether it is suitable to act as a filter in a face mask. We have produced a polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofiber cloth after electrospinning it onto a drum for 3 and 10 min, referred to hereafter as PCL-3 and PCL-10, respectively. Our study found that the middle protection layer (control) of the Henry Schein Earloop Procedure Mask contains pores (average diameter = 5.72 ± 0.62 µm) which are 48 times larger than the diameter of a microorganism an average diameter of ~120 nanometers. However, PCL-10 nanofiber membranes show pores with an average diameter of 1.42 ± 0.34 µm. Our contact angle measurement tests found that all the samples were very hydrophobic (contact angle values varied between 120 and 150 degrees). However, both PCL cloths’ contact angle values were lower compared to the control. The produced PCL cloths showed a lower water droplet absorption compared to the control. Thermal studies found that PCL is stable in extreme conditions and no plasticizing effect occurs due to the presence of a solvent. Mechanical tests showed that PCL-10 cloth had higher strength and modulus compared to the control and PCL-3 under tension loading conditions. A vacuum experiment found that the PCL-10 fiber cloth could withstand a negative pressure of 18 Psi without any signs of breakage, and the mask was able to capture airborne particles and microorganisms. The feasibility of immobilizing anti-bacterial nanoparticles with PCL during electrospinning creates the future potential of producing an anti-bacterial face mask using PCL.","Khandaker, Morshed; Progri, Helga; Arasu, Dhakshyane Tamil; Nikfarjam, Sadegh; Shamim, Nabila",Materials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34361466/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ma14154272,52

Lessons learned are encapsulated into best practices for building and sustaining an LHS within health systems, including the need for early engagement with clinical leaders; pragmatic research questions that focus on continuous improvement; multi‐level, ongoing input from regional and local stakeholders, and business case analyses to inform ongoing investment in sustainable infrastructure to maintain the research‐health system partnership. Essential ingredients for supporting VA as an LHS include data and information sharing capacity, protected time for researchers and leaders, and governance structures to enhance health system ownership of research findings.

This study aimed to explore the impact of the pandemic on the accessibility of care for children with cancer and to view strategies adopted by hospitals for service delivery. METHODS: Weekly average of childhood cancer (≤18 years) patient registrations during pre-lockdown period (January 1 to March 23, 2020) were compared with post-lockdown period (March 24 to May 31, 2020). The effect on the scheduled treatment was investigated for post-lockdown period. A survey of health care providers was conducted to determine centers' adopted strategies. RESULTS: In 30 participating centers, 1146 patients with childhood cancer (797 pre-lockdown period and 349 post-lockdown period) were registered. The weekly average registration was 67.3 and 35.5 patients during pre-lockdown and post-lockdown respectively (decline of 47.9%). Although most centers experienced this decline, there were 4 that saw an increase in patient registrations. The distribution of patients registered post-lockdown was found significantly different by age (lesser older age, P = .010) and distance (lesser travel distance, P = .001). 36.1% of patients, who were scheduled for any of the treatment modalities (chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) during the post-lockdown period, experienced delays. Centers adopted several strategies including modifications to treatment protocols, increased use of growth factors, and increased support from social organizations.

Several RNA viruses and infections caused by these viruses are coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses, rotavirus and reovirus, and picornaviruses. Monitoring for viral infections should cover at least three venues: animals in established breeding and experimental colonies, animals held in entry quarantine, and animal tissues and products destined for in vivo use. For established colonies, monitoring should be tailored to local conditions. Effective monitoring should encompass sampling on a pre-arranged schedule, which can be intensified if evidence or suspicion of viral infection emerges. Because viral infections of rats can spread insidiously, early detection and epidemiologic “staging” should employ a detection matrix that includes clinical observation, appropriate sampling, and sensitive and specific diagnostic testing.","Jacoby, Robert O.; Gaertner, Diane J.",The Laboratory Rat,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780120749034500157; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780120749034500157,52

Plaque Index (PI), Gingival Index (GI), and White Spot Lesions (WSL) were recorded for both groups at baseline (t(0)), every month for the first 3 months (t(1), t(2), t(3)), and at 6 months (t(4)). Carious Lesions Onset (CLO) and Emergency Appointments (EA) were also recorded during the observation period. Inter-group differences were assessed with Student's t test and Chi-square test, intra-group differences were assessed with Cochran’s Q-test (significance α = 0.05). RESULTS: Study group patients showed a significant improvement in plaque control at t(3) (p = 0.010) and t(4) (p = 0.039), compared to control group. No significant difference was observed in the number of WSL between the two groups. No cavities were detected in the study group, while five CLO were diagnosed in the control group (p = 0.049). A decreased number of EA was observed in the study group, but the difference was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Integration of a remote monitoring system during orthodontic treatment was effective in improving plaque control and reducing carious lesions onset. The present findings encourage orthodontists to consider this technology to help maintaining optimal oral health of patients, especially in times of health emergency crisis.","Sangalli, Linda; Savoldi, Fabio; Dalessandri, Domenico; Bonetti, Stefano; Gu, Min; Signoroni, Alberto; Paganelli, Corrado",BMC Oral Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12903-021-01793-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34493255/,52

641480,Novel vaccine strategies against emerging viruses,2013-04-01,"The World Health Organization recently announced that pandemic status has been achieved for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Exponential increases in patient numbers have been reported around the world, along with proportional increases in the number of COVID-19-related deaths. The SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in a population is expected to be influenced by social practices, availability of vaccines or prophylactics, and the prevalence of susceptibility genes in the population. Previous work revealed that cellular uptake of SARS-CoV-2 requires Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE-2) and a cellular protease. The spike (S) protein on SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE-2, which functions as an entry receptor. Following receptor binding, transmembrane protease serine 2 (encoded by TMPRSS2) primes the S protein to allow cellular uptake. Therefore, individual expression of TMPRSS2 may be a crucial determinant of SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility. Here, we utilized multiple large genome databases, including the GTEx portal, SNP nexus, and Ensembl genome project, to identify gene expression profiles for TMPRSS2 and its important expression quantitative trait loci. Our results show that four variants (rs464397, rs469390, rs2070788 and rs383510) affect expression of TMPRSS2 in lung tissue. The allele frequency of each variant was then assessed in regional populations, including African, American, European, and three Asian cohorts (China, Japan and Taiwan). Interestingly, our data shows that TMPRSS2-upregulating variants are at higher frequencies in European and American populations than in the Asian populations, which implies that these populations might be relatively susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Irham, Lalu Muhammad; Chou, Wan-Hsuan; Calkins, Marcus J.; Adikusuma, Wirawan; Hsieh, Shie-Liang; Chang, Wei-Chiao",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X20311165; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.05.179; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X20311165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32703421/,52

To identify biomarkers that distinguish patients with CAP from non-CAP controls, we conducted an untargeted global metabolome analysis for plasma samples from 142 patients with CAP (CAP cases) and 97 without CAP (non-CAP controls). Thirteen lipid metabolites could discriminate between CAP cases and non-CAP controls with area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic curve of >0.8 (P ≤ 10−9). The levels of glycosphingolipids, sphingomyelins, lysophosphatidylcholines and L-palmitoylcarnitine were higher, while the levels of lysophosphatidylethanolamines were lower in the CAP cases than those in non-CAP controls. All 13 metabolites could distinguish CAP cases from the non-infection, extrapulmonary infection and non-CAP respiratory tract infection subgroups. The levels of trihexosylceramide (d18:1/16:0) were higher, while the levels of lysophosphatidylethanolamines were lower, in the fatal than those of non-fatal CAP cases.

The impact of COVID-19 is due to both its rapid spread and its severity, but the determinants of severity have not been fully delineated. Objective: Identify factors associated with hospitalization and disease severity in a racially and ethnically diverse cohort of COVID-19 patients. Methods: We analyzed data from COVID-19 patients diagnosed at the University of Cincinnati health system from March 13, 2020 to May 31, 2020. Severe COVID-19 was defined as admission to intensive care unit or death. Logistic regression modeling adjusted for covariates was used to identify the factors associated with hospitalization and severe COVID-19. Results: Among the 689 COVID-19 patients included in our study, 29.2% were non-Hispanic White, 25.5% were non-Hispanic Black, 32.5% were Hispanic, and 12.8% were of other race/ethnicity. About 31.3% of patients were hospitalized and 13.2% had severe disease. In adjusted analyses, the sociodemographic factors associated with hospitalization and/or disease severity included older age, non-Hispanic Black or Hispanic race/ethnicity (compared non-Hispanic White), and smoking. The following comorbidities: diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular diseases, osteoarthritis, and vitamin D deficiency, were associated with hospitalization and/or disease severity. Hematological disorders such as anemia, coagulation disorders, and thrombocytopenia were associated with higher odds of both hospitalization and disease severity. Conclusion: This study confirms race and ethnicity as predictors of severe COVID-19 and identifies clinical risk factors not previously reported such a vitamin D deficiency, hypercholesterolemia, osteoarthritis, and anemia.","Mendy, A.; Apewokin, S.; Wells, A.

643730,Current Methods for Stress Marker Detection in Saliva,2020-09-06,"BACKGROUND: The global COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by marked variations in prevalence, mortality and case fatality across nations. The available evidence to date suggests that social factors significantly influence these variations. The sociological concepts of individualism and collectivism provide a broad explanatory framework for the study of these factors. There is evidence to suggest that cross-cultural variations in collectivism may have emerged via a process of natural selection, as a protective mechanism against infectious diseases. As a test of this hypothesis, this paper examined the association between indices of individualism and collectivism and the prevalence, mortality and case fatality rates of COVID-19 across nations. STUDY DESIGN: This study was a population-level association study based on data in the public domain and from prior publications. METHODS: Data on four standard measures of individualism/collectivism were obtained from the original publications. These were correlated with estimates of the nation-wide prevalence, mortality and fatality rates for COVID-19 in 94 countries, obtained from the Johns Hopkins Medical University real-time dashboard. RESULTS: Individualism was positively correlated with COVID-19 prevalence, mortality and case fatality rates; conversely, measures of collectivism were negatively correlated with these parameters. The strongest association was between scores for individualism and mortality rate, and remained significant after correcting for several potential confounders. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with the prior hypothesis of a relationship between individualism-collectivism and the impact of infectious disease across populations, and have implications in terms of social strategies aimed at minimizing the impact of COVID-19.","Rajkumar, Ravi Philip",Public Health Pract (Oxf),https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhip.2021.100143; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34494009/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666535221000689; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666535221000689,52

However, there are limited data evaluating the scope of these influences on COVID-19 response. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare handwashing and social distancing practices in different countries and evaluate practice predictors using the health belief model (HBM). METHODS: From April 11 to May 1, 2020, we conducted an online, cross-sectional survey disseminated internationally via social media. Participants were adults aged 18 years or older from four different countries: the United States, Mexico, Hong Kong (China), and Taiwan. Primary outcomes were self-reported handwashing and social distancing practices during COVID-19. Predictors included constructs of the HBM: perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, self-efficacy, and cues to action. Associations of these constructs with behavioral outcomes were assessed by multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: We analyzed a total of 71,851 participants, with 3070 from the United States, 3946 from Mexico, 1201 from Hong Kong (China), and 63,634 from Taiwan. Of these countries, respondents from the United States adhered to the most social distancing practices (χ(2)(3)=2169.7, P<.001), while respondents from Taiwan performed the most handwashing (χ(2)(3)=309.8, P<.001). Multivariable logistic regression analyses indicated that self-efficacy was a positive predictor for handwashing (odds ratio [OR](United States) 1.58, 95% CI 1.21-2.07; OR(Mexico) 1.5, 95% CI 1.21-1.96; OR(Hong Kong) 2.48, 95% CI 1.80-3.44; OR(Taiwan) 2.30, 95% CI 2.21-2.39) and social distancing practices (OR(United States) 1.77, 95% CI 1.24-2.49; OR(Mexico) 1.77, 95% CI 1.40-2.25; OR(Hong Kong) 3.25, 95% CI 2.32-4.62; OR(Taiwan) 2.58, 95% CI 2.47-2.68) in all countries. Handwashing was positively associated with perceived susceptibility in Mexico, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, while social distancing was positively associated with perceived severity in the United States, Mexico, and Taiwan. CONCLUSIONS: Social media recruitment strategies can be used to reach a large audience during a pandemic. Self-efficacy was the strongest predictor for handwashing and social distancing.

646908,Clinical Aspects of Feline Retroviruses: A Review,2012-10-31,"The most important characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission that makes it difficult to control are 1) asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission, 2) low incidence or lack of dominant systemic symptoms such as fever, 3) airborne transmission that may need a high infectious dose, and 4) super-spread events (SSEs). Patients with COVID-19 have high viral loads at symptom onset or even a few days prior to symptom onset, and most patients with COVID-19 have only mild respiratory symptoms or merely pauci-/null-symptoms. These characteristics of the virus enable it to easily spread to the community because most patients are unaware of their potential infectivity, and symptom-based control measures cannot prevent this type of transmission. Furthermore, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is also capable of airborne transmission in conditions such as aerosol-generating procedures, under-ventilated indoor spaces, and over-crowded areas. In this context, universal mask-wearing is important to prevent both outward and inward transmission until an adequate degree of herd immunity is achieved through vaccination. Lastly, the SSEs of SARS-CoV-2 transmission emphasize the importance of reducing contacts by limiting social gatherings. The above-mentioned transmission characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 have culminated in the failure of long-lasting quarantine measures, and indicate that only highly effective vaccines can keep the communities safe from this deadly, multifaceted virus.","Bae, Seongman; Lim, Joon Seo; Kim, Ji Yeun; Jung, Jiwon; Kim, Sung-Han",Immune Netw,https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2021.21.e9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33728102/,52

649185,Polymeric and lipid nanoparticles for delivery of self-amplifying RNA vaccines,2021-10-10,"BACKGROUND: We previously showed that the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) increases inflammatory cleaved caspase-1 activity in myocytes, and that caspase-1/11 is protective in sterile liver injury. However, the role of caspase-1/11 in the recovery of muscle from ischemia caused by peripheral arterial disease is unknown. We hypothesized that caspase-1/11 mediates recovery in muscle via effects on autophagy and this is modulated by CQ. METHODS: C57Bl/6 J (WT) and caspase-1/11 double-knockout (KO) mice underwent femoral artery ligation (a model of hind-limb ischemia) with or without CQ (50 mg/kg IP every 2nd day). CQ effects on autophagosome formation, microtubule associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3), and caspase-1 expression was measured using electron microscopy and immunofluorescence. Laser Doppler perfusion imaging documented perfusion every 7 days. After 21 days, in situ physiologic testing in tibialis anterior muscle assessed peak force contraction, and myocyte size and fibrosis was also measured. Muscle satellite cell (MuSC) oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate was measured. Caspase-1 and glycolytic enzyme expression was detected by Western blot. RESULTS: CQ increased autophagosomes, LC3 consolidation, total caspase-1 expression and cleaved caspase-1 in muscle. Perfusion, fibrosis, myofiber regeneration, muscle contraction, MuSC fusion, OCR, ECAR and glycolytic enzyme expression was variably affected by CQ depending on presence of caspase-1/11. CQ decreased perfusion recovery, fibrosis and myofiber size in WT but not caspase-1/11KO mice. CQ diminished peak force in whole muscle, and myocyte fusion in MuSC and these effects were exacerbated in caspase-1/11KO mice. CQ reductions in maximal respiration and ATP production were reduced in caspase-1/11KO mice. Caspase-1/11KO MuSC had significant increases in protein kinase isoforms and aldolase with decreased ECAR. CONCLUSION: Caspase-1/11 signaling affects the response to ischemia in muscle and effects are variably modulated by CQ. This may be critically important for disease treated with CQ and its derivatives, including novel viral diseases (e.g. COVID-19) that are expected to affect patients with comorbidities like cardiovascular disease.","Sachdev, Ulka; Ferrari, Ricardo; Cui, Xiangdong; Pius, Abish; Sahu, Amrita; Reynolds, Michael; Liao, Hong; Sun, Ping; Shinde, Sunita; Ambrosio, Fabrisia; Shiva, Sruti; Loughran, Patricia; Scott, Melanie",Mol Med,https://doi.org/10.1186/s10020-020-00190-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32641037/,52
649255,Measles,2009-01-30,"The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein contains an immunodominant receptor-binding domain (RBD) targeted by most neutralizing antibodies (Abs) in COVID-19 patient plasma. Little is known about neutralizing Abs binding to epitopes outside the RBD and their contribution to protection. Here, we describe 41 human monoclonal Abs (mAbs) derived from memory B cells, which recognize the SARS-CoV-2 S N-terminal domain (NTD) and show that a subset of them neutralize SARS-CoV-2 ultrapotently. We define an antigenic map of the SARS-CoV-2 NTD and identify a supersite (designated site i) recognized by all known NTD-specific neutralizing mAbs. These mAbs inhibit cell-to-cell fusion, activate effector functions, and protect Syrian hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 challenge, albeit selecting escape mutants in some animals. Indeed, several SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P1 lineages, harbor frequent mutations within the NTD supersite suggesting ongoing selective pressure and the importance of NTD-specific neutralizing mAbs for protective immunity and vaccine design.","McCallum, Matthew; De Marco, Anna; Lempp, Florian A.; Tortorici, M.

649663,Adenoviral Vector Vaccines Antigen Transgene,2016-03-18,"Major interventions have been introduced worldwide to slow down the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Large scale lockdown of human movements are effective in reducing the spread, but they come at a cost of significantly limited societal functions. We show that natural human movements are statistically diverse, and the spread of the disease is significantly influenced by a small group of active individuals and gathering venues. We find that interventions focused on these most mobile individuals and popular venues reduce both the peak infection rate and the total infected population while retaining high social activity levels. These trends are seen consistently in simulations with real human mobility data of different scales, resolutions, and modalities from multiple cities across the world. The observation implies that compared to broad sweeping interventions, more heterogeneous strategies that are targeted based on the network effects in human mobility provide a better balance between pandemic control and regular social activities.","Wang, Haotian; Ghosh, Abhirup; Ding, Jiaxin; Sarkar, Rik; Gao, Jie",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33833298/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-87034-z,52

It was met with a combination of mandatory changes (closing of public institutions) and recommended changes (hygiene behavior, physical distancing). It has been emphasized that health-protective behavior such as increased hygiene or physical distancing are able to slow the spread of infections and flatten the curve. Drawing on previous health-psychological studies during the outbreak of various pandemics, we investigated psychological and demographic factors predicting the adoption and engagement in health-protective behavior and changes in such behavior, attitudes, and emotions over time. We recruited a non-representative sample of Norwegians (n = 8676) during a 15-day period (March 12–26 2020) at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in Norway. Employing both traditional methods and exploratory machine learning, we replicated earlier findings that engagement in health-protective behavior is associated with specific demographic characteristics. Further, we observed that increased media exposure, perceiving measures as effective, and perceiving the outbreak as serious was positively related to engagement in health-protective behavior. We also found indications that hygiene and physical distancing behaviors were related to somewhat different psychological and demographic factors. Over the sampling period, reported engagement in physical distancing increased, while experienced concern or fear declined. Contrary to previous studies, we found no or only small positive predictions by confidence in authorities, knowledge about the outbreak, and perceived individual risk, while all of those variables were rather high. These findings provide guidance for health communications or interventions targeting the adoption of health-protective behaviors in order to diminish the spread of COVID-19.","Zickfeld, Janis H.; Schubert, Thomas W.; Herting, Anders Kuvaas; Grahe, Jon; Faasse, Kate",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33123045/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.564083,52

DESIGN: Single-center descriptive cohort study from April 21, to July 7, 2020. SETTING: Critical care recovery clinic at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. PATIENTS: Adults who had critical illness due to coronavirus disease 2019 requiring an ICU stay of 7 days or more and who agreed to a telehealth follow-up in the critical care recovery clinic 1-month post hospital discharge. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASURES AND MAIN RESULTS: Patient-reported outcome measures assessing physical and psychiatric domains were collected electronically, a cognitive test was performed by a clinician, and clinical data were obtained through electronic medical records. Outcome measures assessed postintensive care syndrome symptoms in the physical (Modified Rankin Scale, Dalhousie Clinical Frailty Scale, Neuro-Quality of Life Upper Extremity and Lower Extremity Function, Neuro-Quality of Life Fatigue), psychiatric (Insomnia Severity Scale; Patient Health Questionnaire-9; and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition), and cognitive (Telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment) domains. The 3-Level Version of Euro-QoL-5D was used to assess the physical and psychiatric domains. A diagnosis of postintensive care syndrome was made in cases with evidence of impairment in at least one postintensive care syndrome domain. We included 45 patients with a mean (sd) age of 54 (13) years, and 73% were male. Ninety-one percent of coronavirus disease 2019 ICU survivors fit diagnostic criteria for postintensive care syndrome. 86.7 % had impairments in the physical domain, 22 (48%) reported impairments in the psychiatric domain, and four (8%) had impairments on cognitive screening. We found that 58% had some degree of mobility impairment. In the psychiatric domain, 38% exhibited at least mild depression, and 18 % moderate to severe depression. Eighteen percent presented Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, scores suggestive of posttraumatic stress syndrome diagnosis. In the Telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment, 9% had impaired cognition. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of critical illness related to coronavirus disease 2019 are at high risk of developing postintensive care syndrome.

METHODS: A two-phased survey was conducted, participants were matched according to age and gender. Three different groups were asked which measures they considered most relevant in reducing a COVID-19 transmission, to determine which factors contribute most to the risk of disease, and to evaluate the level of agreement in the assessment of risk factor relevance for (a) the transmission of the disease and (b) the risk of a severe course of COVID-19. RESULTS: Risk factors for an infection that were selected from all three groups were immunosuppression/deficiency, cancer, chronic lung disease, smoking, age and working as a health care professional. Interrater agreement per population was only poor to slight and results were highly heterogeneous. CONCLUSIONS: Our survey shows a broad spectrum of opinions and the associated general uncertainty about the risk factors for infection and a severe course of disease across the groups.

651956,The Development of One Health Approaches in the Western Pacific,2012-10-12,"Prehabilitation has shown its potential for most intra-cavity surgery patients on enhancing preoperative functional capacity and postoperative outcomes. However, its large-scale implementation is limited by several constrictions, such as: i) unsolved practicalities of the service workflow, ii) challenges associated to change management in collaborative care; iii) insufficient access to prehabilitation; iv) relevant percentage of program drop-outs; v) need for program personalization; and, vi) economical sustainability. Transferability of prehabilitation programs from the hospital setting to the community would potentially provide a new scenario with greater accessibility, as well as offer an opportunity to effectively address the aforementioned issues and, thus, optimize healthcare value generation. A core aspect to take into account for an optimal management of prehabilitation programs is to use proper technological tools enabling: i) customizable and interoperable integrated care pathways facilitating personalization of the service and effective engagement among stakeholders; ii) remote monitoring (i.e. physical activity, physiological signs and patient-reported outcomes and experience measures) to support patient adherence to the program and empowerment for self-management; and, iii) use of health risk assessment supporting decision making for personalized service selection. The current manuscript details a proposal to bring digital innovation to community-based prehabilitation programs. Moreover, this approach has the potential to be adopted by programs supporting long-term management of cancer patients, chronic patients and prevention of multimorbidity in subjects at risk.","Barberan-Garcia, Anael; Cano, Isaac; Bongers, Bart C.; Seyfried, Steffen; Ganslandt, Thomas; Herrle, Florian; Martínez-Pallí, Graciela",Front Oncol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2021.662013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34249698/,52

653246,Long-term persistence of infectious Zika virus: Inflammation and behavioral sequela in mice,2020-12-10,"BACKGROUND: The major complication of COVID-19 is hypoxaemic respiratory failure from capillary leak and alveolar oedema. Experimental and early clinical data suggest that the tyrosine-kinase inhibitor imatinib reverses pulmonary capillary leak. METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial was done at 13 academic and non-academic teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. Hospitalised patients (aged ≥18 years) with COVID-19, as confirmed by an RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, requiring supplemental oxygen to maintain a peripheral oxygen saturation of greater than 94% were eligible. Patients were excluded if they had severe pre-existing pulmonary disease, had pre-existing heart failure, had undergone active treatment of a haematological or non-haematological malignancy in the previous 12 months, had cytopenia, or were receiving concomitant treatment with medication known to strongly interact with imatinib. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either oral imatinib, given as a loading dose of 800 mg on day 0 followed by 400 mg daily on days 1–9, or placebo. Randomisation was done with a computer-based clinical data management platform with variable block sizes (containing two, four, or six patients), stratified by study site. The primary outcome was time to discontinuation of mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen for more than 48 consecutive hours, while being alive during a 28-day period. Secondary outcomes included safety, mortality at 28 days, and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. All efficacy and safety analyses were done in all randomised patients who had received at least one dose of study medication (modified intention-to-treat population). This study is registered with the EU Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT 2020–001236–10). FINDINGS: Between March 31, 2020, and Jan 4, 2021, 805 patients were screened, of whom 400 were eligible and randomly assigned to the imatinib group (n=204) or the placebo group (n=196). A total of 385 (96%) patients (median age 64 years [IQR 56–73]) received at least one dose of study medication and were included in the modified intention-to-treat population. Time to discontinuation of ventilation and supplemental oxygen for more than 48 h was not significantly different between the two groups (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0·95 [95% CI 0·76–1·20]). At day 28, 15 (8%) of 197 patients had died in the imatinib group compared with 27 (14%) of 188 patients in the placebo group (unadjusted HR 0·51 [0·27–0·95]). After adjusting for baseline imbalances between the two groups (sex, obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease) the HR for mortality was 0·52 (95% CI 0·26–1·05). The HR for mechanical ventilation in the imatinib group compared with the placebo group was 1·07 (0·63–1·80; p=0·81). The median duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was 7 days (IQR 3–13) in the imatinib group compared with 12 days (6–20) in the placebo group (p=0·0080). 91 (46%) of 197 patients in the imatinib group and 82 (44%) of 188 patients in the placebo group had at least one grade 3 or higher adverse event. The safety evaluation revealed no imatinib-associated adverse events. INTERPRETATION: The study failed to meet its primary outcome, as imatinib did not reduce the time to discontinuation of ventilation and supplemental oxygen for more than 48 consecutive hours in patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen. The observed effects on survival (although attenuated after adjustment for baseline imbalances) and duration of mechanical ventilation suggest that imatinib might confer clinical benefit in hospitalised patients with COVID-19, but further studies are required to validate these findings.

SARS-CoV-2 belongs to an order of Nidovirales with very large RNA genomes. It is proposed that the fidelity of CoV genome replication is aided by an RNA nuclease complex, formed of non-structural proteins 14 and 10 (nsp14-nsp10), an attractive target for antiviral inhibition. Here, we confirm that the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 complex is an RNase. Detailed functional characterisation reveals nsp14-nsp10 is a highly versatile nuclease capable of digesting a wide variety of RNA structures, including those with a blocked 3’-terminus. We propose that the role of nsp14-nsp10 in maintaining replication fidelity goes beyond classical proofreading and purges the nascent replicating RNA strand of a range of potentially replication terminating aberrations. Using the developed assays, we identify a series of drug and drug-like molecules that potently inhibit nsp14-nsp10, including the known Sars-Cov-2 major protease (Mpro) inhibitor ebselen and the HIV integrase inhibitor raltegravir, revealing the potential for bifunctional inhibitors in the treatment of COVID-19.","Baddock, Hannah T.; Brolih, Sanja; Yosaatmadja, Yuliana; Ratnaweera, Malitha; Bielinski, Marcin; Swift, Lonnie P.; Cruz-Migoni, Abimael; Morris, Garrett M.; Schofield, Christopher J.; Gileadi, Opher; McHugh, Peter J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.13.248211,52

Clinical parameters (body temperature and respiratory disease scores), virological and immunological profiles [ELISA and virus neutralizing (VN) antibody titers], macroscopic lung lesions and viral load in the lungs (quantitative real-time PCR and cell culture assay) were assessed in vaccinated and both genotype 1 and 2 PRRSV challenged pigs. Our results showed that the commercial vaccine failed to protect pigs adequately against the clinical disease, viremia and lung lesions caused by the challenged field isolates, Kazakh strains of PRRSV type 1 and type 2 genotypes. In contrast, clinical protection, absence of viremia and lung lesions in D/KV/ADJ vaccinated pigs was associated with generation of VN antibodies in both homologous vaccine strain LKZ/2010 (PRRSV type 2) and a heterogeneous type 1 PRRSV strain (CM/08) challenged pigs. Thus, our data indicated the induction of cross-protective VN antibodies by D/KV/ADJ vaccine, and importantly demonstrated that an inactivated PRRSV vaccine could also induce cross-protective response across the viral genotype.","Tabynov, Kairat; Sansyzbay, Abylay; Tulemissova, Zhanara; Tabynov, Kaissar; Dhakal, Santosh; Samoltyrova, Aigul; Renukaradhya, Gourapura J.; Mambetaliyev, Muratbay",Vet Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2016.06.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27527768/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113516301778; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113516301778,52

The pathogenesis of SARS is highly complex, with multiple factors leading to severe injury in the lungs and dissemination of the virus to several other organs. The SARS coronavirus targets the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, resulting in diffuse alveolar damage. Several organs/cell types may be infected in the course of the illness, including mucosal cells of the intestines, tubular epithelial cells of the kidneys, neurons of the brain, and several types of immune cells, and certain organs may suffer from indirect injury. Extensive studies have provided a basic understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease. In this review we describe the most significant pathological features of SARS, explore the etiological factors causing these pathological changes, and discuss the major pathogenetic mechanisms. The latter include dysregulation of cytokines/chemokines, deficiencies in the innate immune response, direct infection of immune cells, direct viral cytopathic effects, down-regulation of lung protective angiotensin converting enzyme 2, autoimmunity, and genetic factors. It seems that both abnormal immune responses and injury to immune cells may be key factors in the pathogenesis of this new disease.","Gu, Jiang; Korteweg, Christine",The American Journal of Pathology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002944010613296; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002944010613296; http://ajp.amjpathol.org/article/S0002944010613296/pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17392154/,52

Materials and methods: A total of 424 individuals participated in this cross-sectional, observational, and descriptive study; they were stratified into the experimental group (EG), consisting of 235 individuals working from home office during the COVID-19 pandemic; and the control group (CG), with 189 individuals who continued to work in person during this period. All participants answered the Vocal Fatigue Index (VFI) and the Musculoskeletal Pain Investigation Questionnaires. The data were analyzed in a descriptive and inferential manner. Results: Participants in the EG reported more vocal fatigue symptoms and musculoskeletal pain than those in the CG before the pandemic. However, during the pandemic, the EG presented a higher frequency of pain in the posterior of the neck, shoulder, upper back, and temporal and masseter muscles, while the CG presented a higher frequency of pain in the larynx.

International experience has revealed that, even in the countries where mass disasters are less frequent and not involved in conflicts, they are overwhelmed with COVID-19 deaths. Although, in the current scenario with fewer deaths, India’s health-care system can handle the situation of COVID-19 but should be prepared for the worst in terms of appropriate management, and adequate infection prevention measures including handling the dead without hampering the dignity of the deceased and of the surviving family. Before any crisis overwhelms responders and resources, emergency response plans should be established and activated to ensure the reliable identification and documentation of the dead.

In this study, we evaluated the performance of the BD MAX Open System module for identifying viral pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, in nasopharyngeal specimens from individuals with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. We developed and validated a rapid total nucleic acid extraction method based on real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the reliable, high-throughput simultaneous detection of common cold viral pathogens using the BD MAX Platform. The system was evaluated using 205 nasopharyngeal swab clinical samples. For assessment of the limit of detection (LoD), we used SARS-CoV-2, influenza A/B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) RNA standards. The BD MAX dual multiplex real-time RT-PCR panel demonstrated a sensitivity comparable to that of the World Health Organization-recommended SARS-CoV-2 assay with an LoD of 50 copies/PCR. The LoD of influenza A/B and RSV was 100–200 copies/PCR. The overall percent agreement between the BD MAX panel and laboratory-developed RT-PCR test on 55 SARS-CoV-2-positive clinical samples was 100%. Among the 55 positive cases of COVID-19 analysed, no coinfection was detected. The BD MAX rapid multiplex PCR provides a highly sensitive, robust, and accurate assay for the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A/B, and RSV.","Chung, Hsing-Yi; Jian, Ming-Jr; Chang, Chih-Kai; Lin, Jung-Chung; Yeh, Kuo-Ming; Chen, Chien-Wen; Chiu, Sheng-Kang; Wang, Yi-Hui; Liao, Shu-Jung; Li, Shih-Yi; Hsieh, Shan-Shan; Tsai, Shih-Hung; Perng, Cherng-Lih; Yang, Ji-Rong; Liu, Ming-Tsan; Chang, Feng-Yee; Shang, Hung-Sheng",Emerging microbes & infections,https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2021.1873073; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33410371/,52

SUBJECTS/METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective study in adult patients admitted to our COVID-19-free surgical ICU. Only patients staying in ICU for more than 48 hours were included. The ESKAPEEc infections recorded during the COVID-19 period (June 1, 2020 - February 28, 2021) and in the corresponding pre-pandemic period (June 1, 2019 - February 28, 2020) were compared. An interrupted time series analysis was performed to rule out possible confounders. RESULTS: Overall, 173 patients in the COVID-19 period and 132 in the pre-COVID-19 period were investigated. The ESKAPEEc infections were documented in 23 (13.3%) and 35 (26.5%) patients in the pandemic and the pre-pandemic periods, respectively (p = 0.005). Demographics, diagnosis, comorbidities, type of surgery, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, length of mechanical ventilation, hospital and ICU length of stay, ICU death rate, and 28-day hospital mortality were similar in the two groups. In comparison with the pre-pandemic period, no AB was recorded during COVID-19 period, (p = 0.017), while extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing EC infections significantly decreased (p = 0.017). Overall, the ESKAPEEc isolates during pandemic less frequently exhibited multidrug-resistant (p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that a robust adherence to hygiene measures together with human contact restrictions in a COVID-19 free ICU might also restrain the transmission of ESKAPEEc pathogens.","Gaspari, Rita; Spinazzola, Giorgia; Teofili, Luciana; Avolio, Alfonso W; Fiori, Barbara; Maresca, Gian M; Spanu, Teresa; Nicolotti, Nicola; De Pascale, Gennaro; Antonelli, Massimo",Eur J Clin Invest,https://doi.org/10.1111/eci.13687; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34599600/,52

We therefore conducted a survey to explore these issues. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we interviewed 226 PWUD from three Norwegian cities in May/June 2020. Participants completed an interview-administrated questionnaire. Three separate multiple binary logistic regression models were estimated with the outcomes (no/yes): 1. Familiarity with COVID-19 symptoms, 2. Awareness of COVID-19 services tailored towards PWUD and, 3. Willingness to take a COVID-19 test. RESULTS: The mean age was 44.1 years and 73 % were males. Fifty-four percent were injectors, and heroin/other opioids (35.8 %) and cocaine/amphetamine (25.2 %) were the most common main drugs used. Overall, 54.9 % were in opioid maintenance treatment (OMT). The majority (65.9 %) stated they knew the COVID-19 symptoms. Almost all the participants (91.2 %) reported they would take a COVID-19 test if experiencing relevant symptoms. The majority (63.7 %) were not aware of COVID-19 services available to PWUD. OMT patients were more likely to be familiar with COVID-19 symptoms (aOR = 3.4, 95 % CI 1.7; 6.8), and to be aware of COVID-19 services (aOR = 2.7, 95 % CI 1.1; 6.3). Overall, 35.4 % reported reduced drug availability, mainly for tranquilizers, while 61.5 % reported increased drug prices, mainly for cannabis. CONCLUSION: Drug treatment may play an important role in COVID-19 prevention, as those in OMT were more likely to be aware of symptoms and of availability of services.","Welle-Strand, Gabrielle K.; Skurtveit, Svetlana; Clausen, Thomas; Sundal, Christine; Gjersing, Linn",Drug Alcohol Depend,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32961453/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108302; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376871620304671; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0376871620304671,52

Here we sought to develop new G-quadruplex ligands to be exploited as antiviral compounds by enhancing binding toward the viral G-quadruplex structures. We synthesized naphthalene diimide derivatives with a lateral expansion of the aromatic core. The new compounds were able to bind/stabilize the G-quadruplex to a high extent, and some of them displayed clear-cut selectivity toward the viral G-quadruplexes with respect to the human telomeric G-quadruplexes. This feature translated into low nanomolar anti-HIV-1 activity toward two viral strains and encouraging selectivity indexes. The selectivity depended on specific recognition of LTR loop residues; the mechanism of action was ascribed to inhibition of LTR promoter activity in cells. This is the first example of G-quadruplex ligands that show increased selectivity toward the viral G-quadruplexes and display remarkable antiviral activity.","Perrone, Rosalba; Doria, Filippo; Butovskaya, Elena; Frasson, Ilaria; Botti, Silvia; Scalabrin, Matteo; Lago, Sara; Grande, Vincenzo; Nadai, Matteo; Freccero, Mauro; Richter, Sara N.",J Med Chem,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5b01283; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26599611/,52

The purpose of this paper is to clarify the definition and items of Chinese public-health expenditure, then to objectively evaluate the Chinese government’s performance, so as to help the government to perform better in public health. To achieve this goal, we measure the Chinese public-health expenditure at national and provincial levels based on our definition, and then compare it with the expenditures of other countries. The results show that: (1) the level of public-health expenditure in China is relatively low and far lower than that in developed countries; (2) Chinese governments have not paid enough attention to the prevention and control of major public-health emergencies, which may be an important reason for the outbreak of COVID-19; (3) Chinese public-health expenditure shows a fluctuating growth trend, but the growth rate is so slow that it is lower than that of GDP and fiscal expenditure; (4) although the Chinese government inclines the public-health expenditure to the poor provinces in central and western regions, the imbalance and inequity of public-health resource allocation are still expanding among provinces; (5) there is a lot of waste of resources in the public-health system, which seriously reduces the efficiency of public-health expenditure in China.

660426,Inhaled antibodies: formulations require specific development to overcome instability due to nebulization,2021-03-25,"On April 14, the Society of Swallowing and Dysphagia of Japan (SSDJ) proposed its position statement on dysphagia treatment considering the ongoing spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The main routes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are physical contact with infected persons and exposure to respiratory droplets. In cases of infection, the nasal cavity and nasopharynx have the highest viral load in the body. Swallowing occurs in the oral cavity and pharynx, which correspond to the sites of viral proliferation. In addition, the possibility of infection by aerosol transmission is also concerning. Dysphagia treatment includes a broad range of clinical assessments and examinations, dysphagia rehabilitation, oral care, nursing care, and surgical treatments. Any of these can lead to the production of droplets and aerosols, as well as contact with viral particles. In terms of proper infection control measures, all healthcare professionals involved in dysphagia treatment must be fully briefed and must appropriately implement all measures. In addition, most patients with dysphagia should be considered to be at a higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 because they are elderly and have complications including heart diseases, diabetes, respiratory diseases, and cerebrovascular diseases. This statement establishes three regional categories according to the status of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Accordingly, the SSDJ proposes specific infection countermeasures that should be implemented considering 1) the current status of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the region, 2) the patient status of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 3) whether the examinations or procedures conducted correspond to aerosol-generating procedures, depending on the status of dysphagia treatment. This statement is arranged into separate sections providing information and advice in consideration of the COVID-19 outbreak, including “terminology”, “clinical swallowing assessment and examination“, “swallowing therapy”, “oral care”, “surgical procedure for dysphagia”, “tracheotomy care”, and “nursing care”. In areas where SARS-CoV-2 infection is widespread, sufficient personal protective equipment should be used when performing aerosol generation procedures. The current set of statements on dysphagia management in the COVID-19 outbreak is not an evidence-based clinical practice guideline, but a guide for all healthcare workers involved in the treatment of dysphagia during the COVID-19 epidemic to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Kimura, Yurika; Ueha, Rumi; Furukawa, Tatsuya; Oshima, Fumiko; Fujitani, Junko; Nakajima, Junko; Kaneoka, Asako; Aoyama, Hisaaki; Fujimoto, Yasushi; Umezaki, Toshiro",Auris Nasus Larynx,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anl.2020.07.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0385814620301656; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0385814620301656; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32736887/,52
660471,Target selectivity in mRNA silencing,2006-02-16,"The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and its related disease (COVID-19) has required an immediate and coordinate healthcare response to face the worldwide emergency and define strategies to maintain the continuum of care for the non-COVID-19 diseases while protecting patients and healthcare providers. The dimension of the COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented risk especially for the more vulnerable populations. To manage patients with cancer adequately, maintaining the highest quality of care, a definition of value-based priorities is necessary to define which interventions can be safely postponed without affecting patients’ outcome. The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) has endorsed a tiered approach across three different levels of priority (high, medium, low) incorporating information on the value-based prioritisation and clinical cogency of the interventions that can be applied for different disease sites. Patients with gynaecological cancer are at particular risk of COVID-19 complications because of their age and prevalence of comorbidities. The definition of priority level should be based on tumour stage and histology, cancer-related symptoms or complications, aim (curative vs palliative) and magnitude of benefit of the oncological intervention, patients’ general condition and preferences. The decision-making process always needs to consider the disease-specific national and international guidelines and the local healthcare system and social resources, and a changing situation in relation to COVID-19 infection. These recommendations aim to provide guidance for the definition of deferrable and undeferrable interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic for ovarian, endometrial and cervical cancers within the context of the ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines.","Colombo, Ilaria; Zaccarelli, Eleonora; Del Grande, Maria; Tomao, Federica; Multinu, Francesco; Betella, Ilaria; Ledermann, Jonathan A; Gonzalez-Martin, Antonio; Sessa, Cristiana; Colombo, Nicoletta",ESMO Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32718919/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2059702920326764; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2059702920326764; https://doi.org/10.1136/esmoopen-2020-000827,52

Recently, FEP has been developed into a Markovian monist perspective (Friston et al. in BC 102: 227–260, 2020). The paper expresses scepticism about the validity of arguments for Markovian monism. The critique is based on the assumption that Markovian models are scientific models, and while we may defend ontological theories about the nature of scientific models, we could not read off metaphysical theses about the nature of target systems (self-organising conscious systems, in the present context) from our theories of nature of scientific models (Markov blankets). The paper draws attention to different ways of understanding Markovian models, as material entities, fictional entities, and mathematical structures. I argue that none of these interpretations contributes to the defence of a metaphysical stance (either in terms of neutral monism or reductive physicalism). This is because scientific representation is a sophisticated process, and properties of Markovian models—such as the property of being neither physical nor mental—could not be projected onto their targets to determine the ontological properties of targets easily.","Beni, Majid D.",Synthese,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-021-03075-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33612868/,52

663159,Polyarteritis Nodosa in a Cat with Involvement of the Central and Peripheral Nervous Systems,2018-12-18,"Risk perception and consequently engagement in behaviors to avoid illness often do not match actual risk of infection, morbidity, and mortality. Unrealistic optimism occurs when individuals falsely believe that their personal outcomes will be more favorable than others' in the same risk category. Natural selection could favor overconfidence if its benefits, such as psychological resilience, outweigh its costs. However, just because optimism biases may have offered fitness advantages in our evolutionary past does not mean that they are always optimal. The current project examined relationships among personal risk for severe COVID-19, risk perceptions, and preventative behaviors. We predicted that those with higher risk of severe COVID-19 would exhibit unrealistic optimism and behave in ways inconsistent with their elevated risk of morbidity and mortality. Clinical risk scores for severe COVID-19 were calculated and compared with COVID-19 threat appraisal, compliance with shelter-in-place orders (March 13–May 22, 2020) and travel restrictions, compliance with public health recommendations, and potential covariates like self-rated knowledge about COVID-19 in a robust dataset including 492 participants from McLennan County, TX, USA. While those with high clinical risk acknowledged their greater likelihood of experiencing severe illness if infected, they actually reported lower perceived likelihood of becoming infected in the first place. While it is possible that those with higher clinical risk scores truly are less likely to become infected, the pattern and significance of these results held after controlling for possible occupational exposure, household size, and other factors related to infection probability. Higher clinical risk also predicted more recent travel within Texas and lower distress during the pandemic (i.e., feeling less stressed, depressed, and helpless). Additional behavioral data suggested that those with higher clinical risk scores did not generally behave differently than those with lower scores during the shelter-in-place order. While unrealistic optimism may provide some short-term psychological benefits, it could be dangerous due to improper assessment of hazardous situations; inferring that optimism bias has evolutionary origins does not mean that unrealistic optimism is “optimal” in every situation. This may be especially true when individuals face novel sources (or scales) of risk, such as a global pandemic.","Gassen, Jeffrey; Nowak, Tomasz J.; Henderson, Alexandria D.; Weaver, Sally P.; Baker, Erich J.; Muehlenbein, Michael P.",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.647461; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34149531/,52

The aim of this study was to identify the preventive advice and interventions received by Australian pilgrims before Hajj, and the barriers to and facilitators of their use during Hajj. METHODS: Two cross-sectional surveys of Australians pilgrims aged ≥18 years were undertaken, one before and one after the Hajj 2014. RESULTS: Of 356 pilgrims who completed the survey (response rate 94%), 80% had the influenza vaccine, 30% the pneumococcal vaccine, and 30% the pertussis vaccine. Concern about contracting disease at Hajj was the most cited reason for vaccination (73.4%), and not being aware of vaccine availability was the main reason for non-receipt (56%). Those who obtained pre-travel advice were twice as likely to be vaccinated as those who did not seek advice. Of 150 pilgrims surveyed upon return, 94% reported practicing hand hygiene during Hajj, citing ease of use (67%) and belief in its effectiveness (62.4%) as the main reasons for compliance; university education was a significant predictor of hand hygiene adherence. Fifty-three percent used facemasks, with breathing discomfort (76%) and a feeling of suffocation (40%) being the main obstacles to compliance. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that there are significant opportunities to improve awareness among Australian Hajj pilgrims about the importance of using preventive health measures.","Alqahtani, Amani S.; Wiley, Kerrie E.; Tashani, Mohamed; Willaby, Harold W.; Heywood, Anita E.; BinDhim, Nasser F.; Booy, Robert; Rashid, Harunor",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971216000254; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26875699/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2016.02.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971216000254,52

665850,Human-Specific Evolution and Adaptation Led to Major Qualitative Differences in the Variable Receptors of Human and Chimpanzee Natural Killer Cells,2010-11-04,"INTRODUCTION: For early detection of sepsis, automated systems within the electronic health record have evolved to alert emergency department (ED) personnel to the possibility of sepsis, and in some cases link them to suggested care pathways. We conducted a systematic review of automated sepsis-alert detection systems in the ED. METHODS: We searched multiple health literature databases from the earliest available dates to August 2018. Articles were screened based on abstract, again via manuscript, and further narrowed with set inclusion criteria: 1) adult patients in the ED diagnosed with sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock; 2) an electronic system that alerts a healthcare provider of sepsis in real or near-real time; and 3) measures of diagnostic accuracy or quality of sepsis alerts. The final, detailed review was guided by QUADAS-2 and GRADE criteria. We tracked all articles using an online tool (Covidence), and the review was registered with PROSPERO registry of reviews. A two-author consensus was reached at the article choice stage and final review stage. Due to the variation in alert criteria and methods of sepsis diagnosis confirmation, the data were not combined for meta-analysis. RESULTS: We screened 693 articles by title and abstract and 20 by full text; we then selected 10 for the study. The articles were published between 2009-2018. Two studies had algorithm-based alert systems, while eight had rule-based alert systems. All systems used different criteria based on systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) to define sepsis. Sensitivities ranged from 10-100%, specificities from 78-99%, and positive predictive value from 5.8-54%. Negative predictive value was consistently high at 99-100%. Studies showed some evidence for improved process-of-care markers, including improved time to antibiotics. Length of stay improved in two studies. One low quality study showed improved mortality. CONCLUSION: The limited evidence available suggests that sepsis alerts in the ED setting can be set to high sensitivity. No high-quality studies showed a difference in mortality, but evidence exists for improvements in process of care. Significant further work is needed to understand the consequences of alert fatigue and sensitivity set points.","Hwang, Matthew I; Bond, William F; Powell, Emilie S",West J Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32970576/; https://doi.org/10.5811/westjem.2020.5.46010,52

In particular, we consider several variations of the classical susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model by introducing more compartments and delay in the dynamics described by integer-order, fractional-order, and time-delay models. We report the results for the spread of COVID-19 in New York City, Rhode Island and Michigan states, and Italy, by simultaneously inferring the unknown parameters and the unobserved dynamics. For integer-order and time-delay models, we fit the available data by identifying time-dependent parameters, which are represented by neural networks (NNs). In contrast, for fractional differential models, we fit the data by determining different time-dependent derivative orders for each compartment, which we represent by NNs. We investigate the identifiability of these unknown functions for different datasets, and quantify the uncertainty associated with NNs and with control measures in forecasting the pandemic.","Kharazmi, E.; Cai, M.; Zheng, X.; Lin, G.; Karniadakis, G.

To take advantage of the full potential of the immune system, cancer immunotherapy must incorporate new biotechnologies such as mRNA technology that may synergize with already approved immunotherapies and act more effectively on immune targets.Areas covered: This review describes the basics of mRNA biotechnology and provides insight into the recent advances in the use of mRNA for the local and systemic delivery of immunostimulatory antibodies, proinflammatory cytokines or for optimizing adoptive T-cell therapy.Expert opinion: mRNA-based nanomedicines have great potential to expand the arsenal of immunotherapy tools due to their ability to simplify and accelerate drug development and their suitability for transient and local expression of immunostimulatory molecules, whose systemic and sustained expression would be toxic. The success of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines has highlighted the feasibility of this approach. Continuous advances in the delivery and construction of RNA-based vectors hold promise for improvements in clinical efficacy.","Di Trani, Claudia Augusta; Fernandez-Sendin, Myriam; Cirella, Assunta; Segués, Aina; Olivera, Irene; Bolaños, Elixabet; Melero, Ignacio; Berraondo, Pedro",Expert opinion on drug discovery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34496689/; https://doi.org/10.1080/17460441.2021.1978972,52

Two published models for estimating the transfusion-transmission risk from EIDs, referred to as the Biggerstaff-Petersen model and the European Upfront Risk Assessment Tool (EUFRAT), respectively, have been applied to several EIDs in outbreak situations. We describe and compare the methodological principles of both models, highlighting their similarities and differences. We also discuss the appropriateness of comparing results from the two models. Quantitating the TT risk of EIDs can inform decisions about risk mitigation strategies and their cost-effectiveness. Finally, we present a qualitative risk assessment for Zika virus (ZIKV), an EID agent that has caused several outbreaks since 2007. In the latest and largest ever outbreak, several probable cases of transfusion-transmission ZIKV have been reported, indicating that it is transfusion-transmissible and therefore a risk to blood safety.

In COVID-19, lungs are affected bilaterally, become edematous and red/tan mottled to maroon in color with firm consistency. Distinct parenchymal changes, firm thrombi in the peripheral pulmonary vessels along with diffuse alveolar damage, have been the most consistent feature of COVID-19-related lung pathology.

All initial validation studies with the control DNA proved to be type‐specific. In order to evaluate the reliability of HPV type‐specific LAMP detecting HPV DNA from clinical samples, tissue specimens were obtained from 27 patients with external genital polypoid lesions. The histologic diagnoses included condyloma acuminatum (n = 21), bowenoid papulosis (n = 2), seborrheic keratosis (n = 2), epidermolytic acanthoma (n = 1), and hairy nymphae (n = 1). HPV‐6 DNA and HPV‐11 DNA were detected in 18 and 3 of 21 condylomata acuminata, respectively, and there was no simultaneous infection. HPV‐16 DNA was detected in one of two bowenoid papuloses. HPV DNA was not detected in the seborrheic keratoses, epidermolytic acanthoma, and hairy nymphae. These results correlated perfectly with those from real‐time PCR analysis. Most positive samples contained high copy numbers of HPV DNA. HPV‐11 DNA was detected in one case that could not be detected by PCR. The average reaction time was about 59 min. There was a linear correlation between the genome quantity and reaction time to reach the threshold. The LAMP method has an additional advantage as a quantitative method, and is superior in terms of sensitivity, specificity, rapidity, and simplicity, and can potentially be a valuable tool for the detection of HPV DNA.

The spike is a class I viral fusion glycoprotein that extends from the viral surface and is responsible for viral entry into the host cell and is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike samples multiple conformations in a compromise between evading immune recognition and searching for the host-cell surface receptor. Using atomistic simulations of the glycosylated wild-type spike in the closed and 1-up RBD conformations, we map the free energy landscape for RBD opening and identify interactions in an allosteric pocket that influence RBD dynamics. The results provide an explanation for experimental observation of increased antibody binding for a clinical variant with a substitution in this pocket. Our results also suggest the possibility of allosteric targeting of the RBD equilibrium to favor open states via binding of small molecules to the hinge pocket. In addition to potential value as experimental probes to quantify RBD conformational heterogeneity, small molecules that modulate the RBD equilibrium could help explore the relationship between RBD opening and S1 shedding.","Fallon, Lucy; Belfon, Kellon A.

This is in part because methodological differences limit the comparability of data from these two regions. Using identical molecular detection methods, we tested 1174 Ghanaian and 539 German children with acute respiratory infections sampled over 12 months for the 15 most common respiratory viruses by PCR. A total 43.2% of the Ghanaian and 56.6% of the German children tested positive for at least one respiratory virus. The pneumoviruses respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus were most frequently detected, in 13.1% and 25.1% within the Ghanaian and German children, respectively. At both study sites, pneumoviruses were more often observed at younger ages (p <0.001). In the Ghanaian rainy season, enveloped viruses were detected twice as often as non-enveloped viruses (prevalence rate ratio (PR) 2.0, 95% CI 1.7–2.4). In contrast, non-enveloped viruses were more frequent during the Ghanaian dry season (PR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4–0.8). In Germany, enveloped viruses were also more frequently detected during the relatively colder winter season (PR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2–2.1) and non-enveloped viruses during summer (PR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5–0.9). Despite a distance of about 5000 km and a difference of 44° latitude separating Germany and Ghana, virus spectra, age associations and seasonal fluctuation showed similarities between sites.

Identifying mechanisms driving pathogen persistence is a vital component of wildlife disease ecology and control. Asymptomatic, chronically infected individuals are an oft‐cited potential reservoir of infection, but demonstrations of the importance of chronic shedding to pathogen persistence at the population‐level remain scarce. 2. Studying chronic shedding using commonly collected disease data is hampered by numerous challenges, including short‐term surveillance that focuses on single epidemics and acutely ill individuals, the subtle dynamical influence of chronic shedding relative to more obvious epidemic drivers, and poor ability to differentiate between the effects of population prevalence of chronic shedding vs. intensity and duration of chronic shedding in individuals. 3. We use chronic shedding of Leptospira interrogans serovar Pomona in California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) as a case study to illustrate how these challenges can be addressed. Using leptospirosis‐induced strands as a measure of disease incidence, we fit models with and without chronic shedding, and with different seasonal drivers, to determine the time‐scale over which chronic shedding is detectable and the interactions between chronic shedding and seasonal drivers needed to explain persistence and outbreak patterns. 4. Chronic shedding can enable persistence of L. interrogans within the sea lion population. However, the importance of chronic shedding was only apparent when surveillance data included at least two outbreaks and the intervening inter‐epidemic trough during which fadeout of transmission was most likely. Seasonal transmission, as opposed to seasonal recruitment of susceptibles, was the dominant driver of seasonality in this system, and both seasonal factors had limited impact on long‐term pathogen persistence. 5. We show that the temporal extent of surveillance data can have a dramatic impact on inferences about population processes, where the failure to identify both short‐ and long‐term ecological drivers can have cascading impacts on understanding higher order ecological phenomena, such as pathogen persistence.","Buhnerkempe, Michael G.; Prager, Katherine C.; Strelioff, Christopher C.; Greig, Denise J.; Laake, Jeff L.; Melin, Sharon R.; DeLong, Robert L.; Gulland, Frances M.D.; Lloyd‐Smith, James O.",J Anim Ecol,https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12656; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28207932/,52

One idea that has garnered considerable attention, particularly on social media and in free open-access medicine, is the notion that lung injury due to COVID-19 is more similar to high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). Drawing on this concept, it has also been proposed that treatments typically employed in the management of HAPE and other forms of acute altitude illness—pulmonary vasodilators and acetazolamide—should be considered for COVID-19. Despite some similarities in clinical features between the two entities, such as hypoxemia, radiographic opacities, and altered lung compliance, the pathophysiological mechanisms of HAPE and lung injury due to COVID-19 are fundamentally different, and the entities cannot be viewed as equivalent. Although of high utility in the management of HAPE and acute mountain sickness, systemically delivered pulmonary vasodilators and acetazolamide should not be used in the treatment of COVID-19, as they carry the risk of multiple adverse consequences, including worsened ventilation–perfusion matching, impaired carbon dioxide transport, systemic hypotension, and increased work of breathing.","Luks, Andrew M.; Swenson, Erik R.",Ann Am Thorac Soc,https://doi.org/10.1513/annalsats.202004-327cme; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32735170/,52

To analyze the role of temperature, humidity, date of first case diagnosed (DFC) and the behavior of the growth-curve of cumulative frequency (CF) [number of days to rise (DCS) and reach the first 100 cases (D100), and the difference between them (ΔDD)] with the doubling time (Td) of Covid-19 cases in 67 countries grouped by climate zone. Design. Retrospective incident case study. Setting. WHO based register of cumulative incidence of Covid-19 cases. Participants. 1,706,914 subjects diagnosed between 12-29-2019 and 4-15-2020. Exposures. SARS-Cov-2 virus, ambient humidity, temperature and climate areas (temperate, tropical/subtropical). Main outcome measures. Comparison of DCS, D100, ΔDD, DFC, humidity, temperature, Td for the first (Td10) and second (Td20) ten days of the CF growth-curve between countries according to climate zone, and identification of factors involved in Td, as well as predictors of CF using lineal regression models. Results. Td10 and Td20 were ≥3 days longer in tropical/subtropical vs. temperate areas (2.8[plusmn]1.2 vs. 5.7[plusmn]3.4; p=1.41E-05 and 4.6[plusmn]1.8 vs. 8.6[plusmn]4.2; p=9.7E-05, respectively). The factors involved in Td10 (DFC and ΔDD) were different than those in Td20 (Td10 and climate areas). After D100, the fastest growth-curves during the first 10 days, were associated with Td10<2 and Td10<3 in temperate and tropical/subtropical countries, respectively. The fold change Td20/Td10 >2 was associated with earlier flattening of the growth-curve. In multivariate models, Td10, DFC and ambient temperature were negatively related with CF and explained 44.7% (r2 = 0.447) of CF variability at day 20 of the growth-curve, while Td20 and DFC were negatively related with CF and explained 63.8% (r2 = 0.638) of CF variability towards day 30 of the growth-curve. Conclusions. The larger Td in tropical/subtropical countries is positively related to DFC and temperature. Td and environmental factors explain 64% of CF variability in the best of cases. Therefore, other factors, such as pandemic containment measures, would explain the remaining variability.","Berumen, Jaime; Schmulson, Max; Guerrero, Guadalupe; Barrera, Elizabeth; Larriva-Sahd, Jorge; Olaiz, Gustavo; Garcia-Leyva, Rebeca; Wong-Chew, Rosa M; Betancourt-Cravioto, Miguel; Gallardo, Hector; Fajardo-Dolci, German; Tapia-Conyer, Roberto",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.18.20070920; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.18.20070920v1?rss=1,52

670828,The relationship between the gut microbiome and host gene expression: a review,2020-11-22,"Abstract The emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus (HPAIV) subtype H5N1 in 1997 has since resulted in large outbreaks in poultry and in transmission from poultry to humans, mostly in southeast Asia, but also in several European countries. Effective diagnosis and control measures are essential for the management of HPAIV infections. To develop a rapid diagnostic test, a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against influenza virus A subtype H5 was generated. Eleven mAbs were produced and characterised according to their reactivity by indirect and sandwich ELISA and western blotting against different H5 subtypes representing past and viruses currently circulating. Ten out of 11 mAbs reacted strongly with the haemagglutinin (HA) protein of H5 viruses, whereas one mAb reacted with the M1 protein. Targeted HA protein epitopes seemed to be conformational. One hybridoma clone binds to a linear epitope of the M1 protein. One specific mAb reacts with HPAIV H5 in the immunofluorescence test, and two antibodies neutralised H5 viruses. On the basis of the results, the set of seven mAbs is appropriate for developing diagnostic tests. With the generated mAbs, a sandwich ELISA was developed recognising all H5N1 strains tested but no other influenza viruses. With this ELISA, as little as 0.005 HA units or 0.1ng/ml H5N1 was detected, surpassing other ELISA tests. The novel reagents have the potential to improve significantly available rapid antigen detection systems.","Linke, Sonja; Neubauer, Katrin; Dorner, Martin B.; Dorner, Brigitte G.; Pauli, Georg; Schweiger, Brunhilde",Journal of Virological Methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2011.04.025; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093411001637; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093411001637; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21549148/,52

However, their prothrombotic state is incompletely understood. Therefore, we measured in vivo activation markers of hemostasis, plasma levels of hemostatic proteins, and functional assays of coagulation and fibrinolysis in plasma from patients with COVID‐19 and determined their association with disease severity and 30‐day mortality. METHODS: We included 102 patients with COVID‐19 receiving various levels of respiratory support admitted to general wards, intermediate units, or intensive care units and collected plasma samples shortly after hospital admission. RESULTS: Patients with COVID‐19 with higher respiratory support had increased in vivo activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis, as reflected by higher plasma levels of d‐dimer, thrombin‐antithrombin, and plasmin‐antiplasmin complexes as compared to patients with no to minimal respiratory support and healthy controls. Moreover, the patients with COVID‐19 with higher respiratory support exhibited substantial ex vivo thrombin generation and lower ex vivo fibrinolytic capacity, despite higher doses of anticoagulant therapy compared to less severely ill patients. Fibrinogen, factor VIII, and von Willebrand factor levels increased, and ADAMTS13 levels decreased with increasing respiratory support in patients with COVID‐19. Low platelet count; low levels of prothrombin, antithrombin, and ADAMTS13; and high levels of von Willebrand factor were associated with short‐term mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Severe COVID‐19 is associated with prothrombotic changes with increased in vivo activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis, despite anticoagulant therapy.","von Meijenfeldt, Fien A.; Havervall, Sebastian; Adelmeijer, Jelle; Lundström, Annika; Rudberg, Ann‐Sofie; Magnusson, Maria; Mackman, Nigel; Thalin, Charlotte; Lisman, Ton",Res Pract Thromb Haemost,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33537537/; https://doi.org/10.1002/rth2.12462,52

To prevent spread of COVID-19, tele-prescription was permitted temporarily. This study investigated the impact of tele-prescription on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) concentrations were retrospectively analyzed in patients with type 2 diabetes who were treated with tele-prescription because of COVID-19 and those who were treated by face-to-face care (non-tele-prescription group) enrolled at the same period of time. Mean HbA1c concentrations and mean change in HbA1c concentration (ΔHbA1c) were compared in these two groups. RESULTS: The mean HbA1c levels of patients were significantly higher after than before the tele-prescription period (7.46% ± 1.24% vs. 7.27% ± 1.13%, p < 0.05). Mean ΔHbA1c was significantly higher in the tele-prescription than in the non-tele-prescription group (0.19% ± 0.68% vs. 0.04% ± 0.95%, p < 0.05). HbA1c was significantly greater in patients taking fewer oral hypoglycemic agents, no insulin, fewer comorbidities (e.g., coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular accident, and diabetic neuropathy), and higher baseline HbA1c.

We investigated an outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in a London Army barracks early in the pandemic. Methods Army personnel, their families and civilians had nasal and throat swabs for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by reverse transcriptase -polymerase chain reaction, virus isolation and whole genome sequencing, along with blood samples for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. All tests were repeated 36 days later. Findings During the first visit, 304 (254 army personnel, 10 family members, 36 civilians, 4 not stated) participated and 24/304 (8%) were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive. Infectious virus was isolated from 7/24 (29%). Of the 285 who provided a blood sample, 7% (19/285) were antibody positive and 63% (12/19) had neutralising antibodies. Twenty-two (22/34, 64%) individuals with laboratory-confirmed infection were asymptomatic. Nine SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive participants were also antibody positive but those who had neutralising antibodies did not have infectious virus. At the second visit, no new infections were detected, and 13% (25/193) were seropositive, including 52% (13/25) with neutralising antibodies. Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity included contact with a confirmed case (RR 25.2; 95%CI 14-45), being female (RR 2.5; 95%CI 1.0-6.0) and two-person shared bathroom (RR 2.6; 95%CI 1.1-6.4). Interpretation We identified high rates of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Public Health control measures can mitigate spread but virus re-introduction from asymptomatic individuals remains a risk. Most seropositive individuals had neutralising antibodies and infectious virus was not recovered from anyone with neutralising antibodies.

The incidence of meralgia paresthetica increases with obesity and diabetes. The unique anatomy of the nerve that tunnels through the inguinal ligament predisposes it to inflammation, trauma, and entrapment. The pathology of meralgia paresthetica parallels that of entrapment neuropathies but with additional inflammatory overlay in certain instances. The clinical diagnosis is relatively simple due to its unique clinical features. The prognosis is generally excellent, and the treatment is straightforward that includes peripheral nerve blocks, neurectomy, nerve decompression, and pulsed radiofrequency neuromodulation. This current case of meralgia paresthetica highlights the salient clinical symptoms and signs. We have also described the electrophysiological studies of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, its anatomical variations, and the associations of meralgia paresthetica with bariatric surgery, critical care patients, tight clothing, pregnancy, and posterior spine surgery.

OBJECTIVE: This study provides a timely assessment of household food insecurity (HFI) in the Chinese city of Wuhan during the COVID-19 epidemic period and also investigates its determinant factors. DESIGN: We collected valid data on food insecurity from 653 households in Wuhan via an online questionnaire in March 2020. The Household Food Insecurity Access Scale Score (HFIASS) was used to measure HFI, and a multiple linear regression model was used to determine the HFIASS. RESULTS: The mean HFIASS in Wuhan was 9.42 (standard deviation: 5.82), with more than 50% of the households had an HFIASS < 9. Compared with normal conditions, lockdown measures had a huge negative impact on household food security. The results revealed that socio-demographic characteristics remained the underlying determinants of HFIASS during the epidemic. Households in Wuhan with local Hukou (city household registration) and self-owned property had a lower risk of food insecurity. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: After the restriction of conventional food access channels, intermediary food purchase methods such as group purchasing, shopping with the help of neighborhood committees, property management agents, and volunteers became the most important or the only channel for residents to access food. There were similarities in the use of these intermediary channels. Based on the probability that the epidemic will continue and the probability of similar public health-related outbreaks in the future, the study calls for a more resilient and responsive sustainable food supply system by harnessing the capacity of communities, e-commerce and rapid logistics.","Zhang, Yu; Yang, Kui; Hou, Song; Zhong, Taiyang; Crush, Jonathan",Food Nutr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33776620/; https://doi.org/10.29219/fnr.v65.5501,52

METHODS: We constructed stable AML cell lines with downregulated expression of circRNF13, and then, we explored the effect of downregulation of circRNF13 expression on the proliferation, migration, and invasion through qRT-PCR, MTT curve, colony formation, transwell migration and invasion experiment, cell cycle, apoptosis, Caspase 3/7 assay, and other experiments. We also studied the expression of C-myc and Tenascin-C by qRT-PCR to explore the role of circRNF13. RESULTS: When the expression of circRNF13 was downregulated, the proliferation rate of AML cells decreased significantly, the cell cycle was blocked to G1 phase, and apoptosis rate increased significantly. C-myc related to cell proliferation decreased significantly at RNA level. Furthermore, when the expression of circRNF13 was downregulated, the migration and invasion ability of AML cells was significantly reduced, and the expression of Tenascin-C related to migration and invasion also decreased significantly. The luciferase reporter assay system confirmed that miRNA-1224-5p was the direct target of circRNF13. CONCLUSION: CircRNF13 inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of AML cells by regulating the expression of miRNA-1224-5p.

Infections are the first cause of hospital admission, which often occurs in the home country of pilgrims. METHODS: Literature review on PubMed from 1952 to November 2015 on the epidemiology and prevention of infections contracted during the Hajj, using the keywords “Hajj” and “infections”. RESULTS: Respiratory tract infections, ENT infections, influenza, pyogenic pneumonia, whooping cough, and tuberculosis are most frequently observed during the Hajj. Outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis have been reported in pilgrims and their contacts. Waterborne infections such as gastroenteritis and hepatitis A are common, despite the improvement of health conditions. Pyoderma and furuncles are also frequently observed. Recently, dengue fever, Alkhumra hemorrhagic fever, and Rift Valley fever have emerged but no case of MERS-coronavirus, appeared in Saudi Arabia in 2012, have yet been observed during the 2012–2014 Hajj. CONCLUSION: Prevention is based on compulsory meningococcal vaccination, vaccination against seasonal influenza and pneumococcal infections for pilgrims at high risk of contracting the infection, and on vaccination against hepatitis A. Updating immunization for diphtheria/tetanus/poliomyelitis/pertussis and measles/mumps is also crucial and pilgrims must comply with hygiene precautions.","Salmon-Rousseau, A.; Piednoir, E.; Cattoir, V.; de La Blanchardière, A.",Med Mal Infect,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medmal.2016.04.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X16300105; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0399077X16300105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27230822/,52
673607,Convalescent plasma trial shows no benefit,2020-10-02,"BACKGROUND: Many civil liberties organizations have raised concerns that substandard medical care in United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facilities have led to preventable deaths. The 2018 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill required ICE to make public all reports regarding in-custody deaths within 90 days beginning in Fiscal Year (FY) 2018. Accordingly, ICE has released death reports following each in-custody death since April of 2018. This study describes characteristics of deaths among individuals in ICE detention following the FY2018 mandate. METHODS: Data was extracted from death reports published by ICE following the FY2018 mandate. Causes of death were categorized as suicide or medical, and medical deaths as COVID-19-related or not. Characteristics were compared between medical and suicide deaths, and among medical deaths between COVID-19-related and non-COVID-19-related deaths. Additionally, death rates per person-year and per 100,000 admissions were calculated for FY2018, 2019, and 2020 using methods from prior work evaluating deaths among detained immigrants in the United States. RESULTS: Since April 2018, 35 individuals have died in ICE detention. The death rate per 100,000 admissions in ICE detention was 2.303 in FY2018, 1.499 in FY2019, and 10.833 in FY2020. Suicide by hanging was identified as the cause of death in 9 (25.7%), and medical causes in the remaining 26 (74.3%). Among 26 deaths attributable to medical causes, 8 (30.8%) were attributed to COVID-19, representing 72.7% of 11 deaths occurring since April 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The death rate among individuals in ICE detention is increasing amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Potentially preventable causes of death including COVID-19 and suicide contribute to at least half of recent deaths. Findings suggest that individuals detained by ICE may benefit from improved psychiatric care and prevention measures to combat suicide, as well as increased infection control efforts to reduce mortality associated with COVID-19.","Terp, Sophie; Ahmed, Sameer; Burner, Elizabeth; Ross, Madeline; Grassini, Molly; Fischer, Briah; Parmar, Parveen",AIMS Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3934/publichealth.2021006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33575408/,52

674093,SnapShot: FABP Functions,2020-08-20,"Purpose The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in dramatic changes to avoid virus spread. In Canada, following provincial legislation the Workers’ Compensation Board of Alberta (WCB-Alberta) stopped in-person rehabilitation services on March 23, 2020. On April 1, training began on remote service delivery using videoconferencing or telerehabilitation, which started April 3. We studied WCB-Alberta’s transition to remote rehabilitation service delivery. Methods A population-based descriptive study was conducted, with data extracted from the WCB-Alberta database. This included clinical data from rehabilitation providers. We included workers completing services between January 1 and May 31, 2020. We statistically examined differences before and after the transition to remote services. Results The dataset included 4,516 individuals with work-related injuries. The mean number of work assessments per week pre-COVID was 244.6 (SD 83.5), which reduced to 135.9 (SD 74.5). Workers undergoing remote assessments were significantly more likely to work in health care or trades, did not require an interpreter, and were less likely to be working or judged as ready to return to work. Number of completed rehabilitation programs also reduced from 125.6 to 40.8 per week, with most (67.1%) remote programs being functional restoration. Few adverse effects were observed. Conclusions We describe the transition to completely remote delivery of occupational rehabilitation due to COVID-19 physical distancing restrictions in one Canadian compensation jurisdiction. It appears the use of remote services was successful but proceeded cautiously, with fewer complex cases being referred for assessment or rehabilitation. Further research examining longer-term work outcomes and stakeholder perceptions is needed.","Gross, Douglas P.; Asante, Alexander; Pawluk, Joanne; Niemeläinen, Riikka",J Occup Rehabil,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10926-020-09934-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33118130/,52

In order to slow the infection rates, lockdown has been implemented almost everywhere. Italy, one of the countries most severely affected, entered the “lockdown” on March 8, 2020. METHODS: The COvid Mental hEalth Trial (COMET) network includes 10 Italian university sites and the National Institute of Health. The whole study has three different phases. The first phase includes an online survey conducted between March and May 2020 in the Italian population. Recruitment took place through email invitation letters, social media, mailing lists of universities, national medical associations, and associations of stakeholders (e.g., associations of users/carers). In order to evaluate the impact of lockdown on depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms, multivariate linear regression models were performed, weighted for the propensity score. RESULTS: The final sample consisted of 20,720 participants. Among them, 12.4% of respondents (N = 2,555) reported severe or extremely severe levels of depressive symptoms, 17.6% (N = 3,627) of anxiety symptoms and 41.6% (N = 8,619) reported to feel at least moderately stressed by the situation at the DASS-21. According to the multivariate regression models, the depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms significantly worsened from the week April 9–15 to the week April 30 to May 4 (p < 0.0001). Moreover, female respondents and people with pre-existing mental health problems were at higher risk of developing severe depression and anxiety symptoms (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Although physical isolation and lockdown represent essential public health measures for containing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, they are a serious threat for mental health and well-being of the general population. As an integral part of COVID-19 response, mental health needs should be addressed.","Fiorillo, Andrea; Sampogna, Gaia; Giallonardo, Vincenzo; Del Vecchio, Valeria; Luciano, Mario; Albert, Umberto; Carmassi, Claudia; Carrà, Giuseppe; Cirulli, Francesca; Dell’Osso, Bernardo; Nanni, Maria Giulia; Pompili, Maurizio; Sani, Gabriele; Tortorella, Alfonso; Volpe, Umberto",European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2020.89; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32981568/,52

A perspective,2021-06-15,"CONTEXT: Evidence of the effect of continuous quality improvement (CQI) in public health and valid tools to judge that such effects are not fully formed. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to adapt and apply Shortell et al.'s (1998) four dimensions of CQI in an examination of a public health accountability and performance management initiative in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: In total, 24 semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with informants from public health units and the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. A web survey of public health managers in the province was also carried out. RESULTS: A mix of facilitators and barriers was identified. Leadership and organizational cultures, conducive to CQI success were evident. However, limitations in performance measurement and managerial discretion were key barriers. CONCLUSION: The four dimensions of CQI provided insight into both facilitators and barriers of CQI adoption in public health. Future research should compare the outcomes of public health CQI initiatives to the framework's stated facilitators and barriers.","Price, Alex; Schwartz, Robert; Cohen, Joanna; Manson, Heather; Scott, Fran",Healthc Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28277203/,52

METHODS: Between May 2009 and October 2012, 7733 FRI patients and controls in the Singapore military had clinical data and nasal wash samples collected prospectively and sent for PCR testing. Patients with one pathogen detected (mono-pathogen) were compared with those with two pathogens (dual pathogen) for differences in basic demographics and clinical presentation. RESULTS: In total, 45.8% had one pathogen detected, 20.2% had two pathogens detected, 30.9% had no pathogens detected, and 3.1% had more than two pathogens. Multiple pathogens were associated with recruits, those with asthma and non-smokers. Influenza A (80.0%), influenza B (73.0%) and mycoplasma (70.6%) were most commonly associated with mono-infections, while adenovirus was most commonly associated with dual infections (62.9%). Influenza A paired with S. pneumoniae had higher proportions of chills and rigors than their respective mono-pathogens (P = 0.03, P = 0.009). H. influenzae paired with either enterovirus or parainfluenzae had higher proportions of cough with phlegm than their respective mono-pathogens. Although there were observed differences in mean proportions of body temperature, nasal symptoms, sore throat, body aches and joint pains between viral and bacterial mono-pathogens, there were few differences between distinct dual-pathogen pairs and their respective mono-pathogen counterparts. CONCLUSION: A substantial number of FRI patients have multiple pathogens detected. Observed clinical differences between patients of dual pathogen and mono-pathogen indicate the likely presence of complex microbial interactions between the various pathogens.","Ho, Zheng Jie Marc; Zhao, Xiahong; Cook, Alex R; Loh, Jin Phang; Ng, Sock Hoon; Tan, Boon Huan; Lee, Vernon J",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12312; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25827870/,52
675359,Recent advances and perspectives of nucleic acid detection for coronavirus,2020-03-01,"BACKGROUND: Despite the prevalent use of geosocial networking dating apps (GNDAs), there is limited research on their impact on sexual health outcomes among young music festivals attendees. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the use of GNDAs and risky sexual behaviors of young adults attending a music festival. METHODS: The music festival attendees (N=862) completed a cross-sectional questionnaire study encompassing demographics, dating app use, and risky sexual behaviors in the past year. Associations between these variables were estimated using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Of the respondents, 51.9% (448/862) had used GNDAs in the previous year. Compared with people who had 1 partner, people who had 2-5 sexual partners in the previous year had almost 7 times the odds of using dating apps (odds ratio [OR] 6.581, 95% CI 4.643-9.328) and those who had more than 5 partners had 14 times the odds of using dating apps (OR 14.294, 95% CI 8.92-22.906). Condom users were more likely to be app users (P<.001), as were those who relied on emergency Plan B (P=.002), but people using hormonal contraception were less likely to use dating apps (P=.004). After adjusting for sexual orientation and relationship status, those having casual sex had 3.096 (95% CI 2.225-4.307; P<.001) times the odds of using dating apps and those having multiple sexual partners had 3.943 (95% CI 2.782-5.588; P<.001) times the odds of using dating apps. Similarly, after adjusting for sexual orientation, relationship status, and number of sexual partners, people who had no discussions before having sex about sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or boundaries were more likely to use dating apps (OR 1.755, 95% CI 1.232-2.500; P=.002). Those who perceived the risk of having sex without contraception to be very high had 2.486 (95% CI 2.213-5.096; P=.01) times the odds of using dating apps than those who perceived no risk. Compared with those who perceived no risk, people who thought that the risk of having multiple sexual partners was low to high had 1.871 (95% CI 1.024-3.418; P=.04) times the odds of using dating apps. A significant number of app users (389/440, 88.4%) indicated that GNDAs should promote safe sex. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified that festival goers engaging in certain high-risk sexual behaviors, including casual sex, having multiple sexual partners, and having sex without discussion about STI status and boundaries, are more likely to use dating apps. Festival goers who perceived sex without any form of contraception, having sex while drunk, and having multiple sexual partners as risky were more likely to be app users. Policy makers and GNDA developers should acknowledge the vulnerability of their users to adverse sexual health outcomes and use GNDAs as a platform to promote risk-reduction practices.","Garga, Shirali; Thomas, Meryl; Bhatia, Ashneet; Sullivan, Aidan; John-Leader, Franklin; Pit, Sabrina",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33856354/; https://doi.org/10.2196/21082,52

The method may be executed using any LC-TOF mass spectrometer, requires no specialised knowledge of glycan analysis and makes use of the differential resolving power of reversed phase HPLC. While this separation technique resolves peptides with high efficiency, glycans are resolved poorly, if at all. Consequently, glycopeptides consisting of the same peptide bearing different glycan structures will all possess very similar retention times and co-elute. While this has previously been viewed as a disadvantage, we show that shared retention time can be used to map multiple glycan species to the same peptide and location. In combination with MSMS and pseudo MS3, we have constructed a detailed mass-retention time database for Spike. This database allows any ESI-TOF equipped lab to reliably identify and quantify spike glycans from a single overnight elastase protein digest in less than 90 minutes.","Chalk, Rod; Greenland, William; Moreira, Tiago; Coker, Jesse; Mukhopadhyay, Shubhashish; Williams, Eleanor; Manning, Charlotte; Bohstedt, Tina; McCrorie, Rama; Fernandez-Cid, Alejandra; Burgess-Brown, Nicola A",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.24.217562,52

The aim of this study was to identify the associations between LS and types of physical activity (PA) in Czech and Polish boys and girls. Methods: The research involved 933 girls and 663 boys aged 15–19 years. LS was diagnosed using the Bern Subjective Well-Being Questionnaire and the WHO-5 Well-Being Index. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire-long form (IPAQ-LF) questionnaire was used to identify the types of weekly PA. Results: Adolescents with the highest LS had more recreational, moderate, vigorous, and total weekly PA. The strongest associations between LS and PA were in the Czech and Polish boys and girls who participated in vigorous PA (VPA). The recommendations for VPA were fulfilled by 45% of Czech and 46% of Polish boys and 40% of Czech and 50% of Polish girls, with the highest LS. The most significant positive moderator between LS and PA was participation in organized PA. Boys with the highest LS were 1.94 times more likely to meet the weekly recommendation of VPA than boys with the lowest LS. Similarly, girls with the highest LS were 1.77 times more likely to meet these recommendations. Conclusions: Promoting both current subjective well-being and organized PA, with an emphasis on achieving the VPA recommendations, may support general LS and a healthy lifestyle in adolescents.","Chmelík, František; Frömel, Karel; Groffik, Dorota; Šafář, Michal; Mitáš, Josef",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18052236; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33668269/,52

676265,Platforms for Production of Protein-Based Vaccines: From Classical to Next-Generation Strategies,2021-07-21,"Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is a fundamental gene expression event in many viruses including SARS-CoV-2, which allows production of essential structural and replicative enzymes from an alternative reading frame. Despite the importance of PRF for the viral life cycle, it is still largely unknown how and to what extent cellular factors alter mechanical properties of frameshifting RNA molecules and thereby impact virulence. This prompted us to comprehensively dissect the interplay between the host proteome and the SARS-CoV-2 frameshift element. Here, we reveal that zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP-S) is a direct and specific regulator of PRF in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. ZAP-S overexpression strongly impairs frameshifting and viral replication. Using in vitro ensemble and single-molecule techniques, we further demonstrate that ZAP-S directly interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA and ribosomes and interferes with the folding of the frameshift RNA. Together these data illuminate ZAP-S as de novo host-encoded specific inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting and expand our understanding of RNA-based gene regulation.","Zimmer, Matthias M.; Kibe, Anuja; Rand, Ulfert; Pekarek, Lukas; Cicin-Sain, Luka; Caliskan, Neva",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.31.445667,52

Early diagnosis is one of the most effective methods to lower the incidence and mortality rates of breast cancer. The human metalloproteinases (MMP) mainly function as proteolytic enzymes degrading the extracellular matrix and plays important roles in most steps of breast tumorigenesis. This retrospective cohort study shows the immunohistochemical expression levels of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-9 in 154 women with breast cancer and 42 women without tumor disease. The samples of breast tissue are assessed using several tissue matrices (TMA). The percentages of staining (≤50%–>50%) and intensity levels of staining (weak, moderate, or intense) are considered. The immunohistochemical expression of the MMP-1-intensity (p = 0.043) and MMP-3 percentage (p = 0.018) and intensity, (p = 0.025) present statistically significant associations with the variable group (control–case); therefore, expression in the tumor tissue samples of these MMPs may be related to the development of breast cancer. The relationships between these MMPs and some clinicopathological factors in breast cancer are also evaluated but no correlation is found. These results suggest the use of MMP-1 and MMP-3 as potential biomarkers of breast cancer diagnosis.","Argote Camacho, Angela Ximena; González Ramírez, Amanda Rocío; Pérez Alonso, Alejandro José; Rejón García, Juan David; Olivares Urbano, María Auxiliadora; Torné Poyatos, Pablo; Ríos Arrabal, Sandra; Núñez, María Isabel",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34445715/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22169012,52

The top of the hood is a HEPA filter connected to a blower to apply negative pressure. We determined the aerosol penetration from outside to inside in laboratory experiments. RESULTS: The penetration of particles from within the hood to the breathing zones of HCWs outside the hood was near 10(-4) (0.01%) in the 200-400 nm size range, and near 10(-3) (0.1%) for smaller particles. Penetration values for particles in the 500 nm – 5 μm range were below 10(-2) (1%). Fluorometric analysis of deposited fluorescein particles on the personal protective equipment of a HCW revealed that negative pressure reduces particle deposition both outside and inside the hood.

The open-ended questions were draft according to the suggestions of Canadian colleagues and administered by 1 interviewer, who was part of the PED staff, at the end of March 2020. All the PED staff was interviewed, on a voluntary basis, using purposive sampling. RESULTS: Most respondents declared to be afraid of becoming infected and of infecting their families. The number of patients seen in the PED has decreased, and the cases tend to be more severe. A shift in the clinical approach to the ill child has occurred, the physical examination is problem-oriented, aiming to avoid un-necessary maneuvers and to minimize the number of practitioners involved.

However, the potential contribution of foods to consumers’ health has so far only been partially exploited. The rapidly evolving scenario of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is stimulating profound reflection on the relationships between food and the etiological agent, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, the status of knowledge regarding food as a possible defense/co-therapeutic strategy against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is considered through the discussion of two main current lines of research. One line of research relates to the role of micronutrients, food components, and diets in the strengthening of the immune system through clinical trials; formulations could be developed as immune system enhancers or as co-adjuvants in therapies. The other line of research relates to investigation of the chemical interactions that specific food compounds can have with host or virus targets so as to interfere with the viral infective cycle of SARS-CoV-2. This line requires, as a first step, an in silico evaluation to discover lead compounds, which may be further developed through drug-design studies, in vitro and in vivo tests, and, finally, clinical trials to obtain therapeutic molecules. All of these promising strategies promote the role of food in preventive/co-therapeutic strategies to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.","Di Matteo, Giacomo; Spano, Mattia; Grosso, Michela; Salvo, Andrea; Ingallina, Cinzia; Russo, Mariateresa; Ritieni, Alberto; Mannina, Luisa",Foods,https://doi.org/10.3390/foods9081036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32752217/,52

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the rate of hospitalization and mode of in-hospital treatment of patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) before and during lockdown in the Campania region of Italy. The study population includes all patients with CLTI hospitalized in Campania over a 10-week period: 5 weeks before and 5 weeks during lockdown (n = 453). Patients were treated medically and/or underwent urgent revascularization and/or major amputation of the lower extremities. Mean age was 69.2 ± 10.6 years and 27.6% of the patients were women. During hospitalization, 21.9% of patients were treated medically, 78.1% underwent revascularization, and 17.4% required amputations. In the weeks during the lockdown, a reduced rate of hospitalization for CLTI was observed compared with the weeks before lockdown (25 vs 74/100,000 inhabitants/year; incidence rate ratio: 0.34, 95% CI 0.32–0.37). This effect persisted to the end of the study period. An increased amputation rate in the weeks during lockdown was observed (29.3% vs 13.4%; p < 0.001). This study reports a reduced rate of CLTI-related hospitalization and an increased in-hospital amputation rate during lockdown in Campania. Ensuring appropriate treatment for patients with CLTI should be prioritized, even during disease containment measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other similar conditions.","Stabile, Eugenio; Piccolo, Raffaele; Franzese, Michele; Accarino, Giancarlo; Bracale, Umberto Marcello; Cappello, Enrico; Cioffi, Giovanni; Cioppa, Angelo; Crinisio, Adolfo; Flora, Loris; Landino, Pietro; Martelli, Eugenio; Mancusi, Rosario; Niola, Raffaella; Petrosino, Fernando; Razzano, Davide; Ruotolo, Carlo; Salemme, Luigi; Sangiuolo, Paolo; Santini, Gianpaolo; Soreca, Emilio; Vigliotti, Gennaro; Villari, Bruno; Amabile, Giampaolo; Ammollo, Raffaele Pio; Barbarisi, Danilo; Corbisiero, Alfonsina M; D’angelo, Antonio; Cangiano, Gianluca; De Gregorio, Claudia; De Laurentis, Mario; Laurenzano, Eugenio; Ficarelli, Ilaria; Luongo, Alessandro; Molino, Claudio; Sarti, Giuseppe; Viola, Daniela; Esposito, Giovanni",Vasc Med,https://doi.org/10.1177/1358863x20977678; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33332228/,52

However, information on the interplay between COVID-19 and Chagas disease is lacking. Our aim was to assess clinical characteristics and in-hospital outcomes of patients with CD and COVID-19, and to compare it to non-CD patients. Methods: Patients with COVID-19 diagnosis were selected from the Brazilian COVID-19 Registry, a prospective multicenter cohort, from March to September, 2020. CD diagnosis was based on hospital record at the time of admission. Study data were collected by trained hospital staff using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) tools. Genetic matching for sex, age, hypertension, DM and hospital was performed in a 4:1 ratio. Results: Of the 7,018 patients who had confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the registry, 31 patients with CD and 124 matched controls were included. Overall, the median age was 72 (64.-80) years-old and 44.5% were male. At baseline, heart failure (25.8% vs. 9.7%) and atrial fibrillation (29.0% vs. 5.6%) were more frequent in CD patients than in the controls (p<0.05 for both). C-reactive protein levels were lower in CD patients compared with the controls (55.5 [35.7, 85.0] vs. 94.3 [50.7, 167.5] mg/dL). Seventy-two (46.5%) patients required admission to the intensive care unit. In-hospital management, outcomes and complications were similar between the groups. Conclusions: In this large Brazilian COVID-19 Registry, CD patients had a higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation and chronic heart failure compared with non-CD controls, with no differences in-hospital outcomes.

Information remains limited about the comparative protein expression of host cells in response to TGEV infection. In this study, cellular protein response to TGEV infection in swine testes (ST) cells was analyzed, using the proteomic method of two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D DIGE) coupled with MALDI-TOF-TOF/MS identification. RESULTS: 33 differentially expressed protein spots, of which 23 were up-regulated and 10 were down-regulated were identified. All the protein spots were successfully identified. The identified proteins were involved in the regulation of essential processes such as cellular structure and integrity, RNA processing, protein biosynthesis and modification, vesicle transport, signal transduction, and the mitochondrial pathway. Western blot analysis was used to validate the changes of alpha tubulin, keratin 19, and prohibitin during TGEV infection. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, we have performed the first analysis of the proteomic changes in host cell during TGEV infection. 17 altered cellular proteins that differentially expressed in TGEV infection were identified. The present study provides protein-related information that should be useful for understanding the host cell response to TGEV infection and the underlying mechanism of TGEV replication and pathogenicity.","Zhang, Xin; Shi, Hong-Yan; Chen, Jian-Fei; Shi, Da; Lang, Hong-Wu; Wang, Zhong-Tian; Feng, Li",Proteome Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23855489/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1477-5956-11-31,52

To overcome the challenge of nucleic acid (NA) extraction and testing kit availability efficient method is urgently needed. Objectives: To establish an efficient, time and resource-saving and cost-effective methods, and to propose an ad hoc pooling approach for mass screening of SARS-CoV-2 Methods: Direct clinical sample and NA pooling approach was used for the standard reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test of the SARS CoV-2 targeting the envelop (E) and open reading frame (ORF1ab) genomic region of the virus. In this approach, experimental pools were created using SARS CoV-2 positive clinical samples spiked with up to 9 negative samples prior to NA extraction step to have a final extraction volume of 200L (maximum dilution factor of 10). Viral NA was also subsequently extracted from each pool and tested using the SARS CoV-2 RT-PCR assay. Results: We found that a single positive sample can be amplified and detected in pools of up to 7 samples depending on the ct value of the original sample, corresponding to high, medium, and low SARS CoV-2 viral copies/reaction. However, to minimize false negativity of the assay with pooling strategies and with unknown false negativity rate of the assay under validation, we recommend poling of 4 in 1 using the standard protocols of the assay, reagents and equipment. The predictive algorithm indicated a pooling ratio of 4 in 1 was expected to retain accuracy of the test irrespective of the ct value (relative RNA copy number) of the sample spiked and result in a 237% increase in testing efficiency. Conclusions: The approaches showed its concept in easily customized and resource-saving manner and would allow expanding of current screening capacities and enable the expansion of detection in the community.","Mulu, A.; Alemayehu, D.

The battle between clinicians and the COVID-19 outbreak may be a “protracted war.” The objective of this study was to investigate the risk factors for in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19, so as to provide a reference for the early diagnosis and treatment. This study retrospectively enrolled 118 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, who were admitted to Eastern District of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from February 04, 2020 to March 04, 2020. The demographics and laboratory data were collected and compared between survivors and nonsurvivors. The risk factors of in-hospital mortality were explored by univariable and multivariable logistic regression to construct a clinical prediction model, the prediction efficiency of which was verified by receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve. A total of 118 patients (49 males and 69 females) were included in this study; the results revealed that the following factors associated with in-hospital mortality: older age (odds ratio [OR] 1.175, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.073–1.287, P = .001), neutrophil count greater than 6.3 × 10(9) cells/L (OR 7.174, (95% CI 2.295–22.432, P = .001), lymphocytopenia (OR 0.069, 95% CI 0.007–0.722, P = .026), prothrombin time >13 seconds (OR 11.869, 95% CI 1.433–98.278, P = .022), d-dimer >1 mg/L (OR 22.811, 95% CI 2.224–233.910, P = .008) and procalcitonin (PCT) >0.1 ng/mL (OR 23.022, 95% CI 3.108–170.532, P = .002). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the above indicators for predicting in-hospital mortality were 0.808 (95% CI 0.715–0.901), 0.809 (95% CI 0.710–0.907), 0.811 (95% CI 0.724–0.898), 0.745 (95% CI 0.643–0.847), 0.872 (95% CI 0.804–0.940), 0.881 (95% CI 0.809–0.953), respectively. The AUC of combined diagnosis of these aforementioned factors were 0.992 (95% CI 0.981–1.000). In conclusion, older age, increased neutrophil count, prothrombin time, d-dimer, PCT, and decreased lymphocyte count at admission were risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality of COVID-19. The prediction model combined of these factors could improve the early identification of mortality risk in COVID-19 patients.","Qin, Zhi-jun; Liu, Lei; Sun, Qun; Li, Xia; Luo, Jian-fei; Liu, Jia-sheng; Liu, Dan",Medicine (Baltimore),https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000021700; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32871887/,52

This survey of first-time synchronous teledermatology patients (n = 100) seen by providers of the University of Mississippi Medical Center during Spring 2020 was designed to learn more about patient experiences associated with the technical challenges of synchronous teledermatology. Our patient population had considerable experience with various social media including Facebook (82%) and hardware platforms, such as Apple devices (66%). We found that the majority of patients were satisfied (88.9%) with their synchronous teledermatology encounter and 81.8% of patients did not experience a technical difficulty with their consult. About 15% of patients lost connection with their provider during their consultation. Furthermore, about 30% of patients rated “showing their skin” to their provider as “hardest” on a ten scale. However, about 34% of patients sent “store-and-forward”-type images to supplement their encounter. Despite overwhelming satisfaction with synchronous teledermatology, a majority prefer an in-person consultation for their next visit (68.7%).

Clinical data reveal that in severe COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 infects the lung, leading to a frequently lethal triad of respiratory insufficiency, acute cardiovascular failure, and coagulopathy. Physiologically, ACE2 plays a role in the regulation of three systems that could potentially be involved in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19: the kinin–kallikrein system, resulting in acute lung inflammatory edema; the renin–angiotensin system, promoting cardiovascular instability; and the coagulation system, leading to thromboembolism. Here we assembled a healthy human lung cell atlas meta-analysis with ~ 130,000 public single-cell transcriptomes and show that key elements of the bradykinin, angiotensin and coagulation systems are co-expressed with ACE2 in alveolar cells and associated with their differentiation dynamics, which could explain how changes in ACE2 promoted by SARS-CoV-2 cell entry result in the development of the three most severe clinical components of COVID-19.","Sidarta-Oliveira, Davi; Jara, Carlos Poblete; Ferruzzi, Adriano J.; Skaf, Munir S.; Velander, William H.; Araujo, Eliana P.; Velloso, Licio A.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33177594/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-76488-2,52

Risk scores could improve care and be used for prognostic enrichment in trials. We aimed to compare machine learning algorithms and develop a simple tool for predicting 28-day mortality in ICU patients with coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN: This was an observational study of adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019. The primary outcome was 28-day inhospital mortality. Machine learning models and a simple tool were derived using variables from the first 48 hours of ICU admission and validated externally in independent sites and temporally with more recent admissions. Models were compared with a modified Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, National Early Warning Score, and CURB-65 using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and calibration. SETTING: Sixty-eight U.S. ICUs. PATIENTS: Adults with coronavirus disease 2019 admitted to 68 ICUs in the United States between March 4, 2020, and June 29, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The study included 5,075 patients, 1,846 (36.4%) of whom died by day 28. eXtreme Gradient Boosting had the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in external validation (0.81) and was well-calibrated, while k-nearest neighbors were the lowest performing machine learning algorithm (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.69). Findings were similar with temporal validation. The simple tool, which was created using the most important features from the eXtreme Gradient Boosting model, had a significantly higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in external validation (0.78) than the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (0.69), National Early Warning Score (0.60), and CURB-65 (0.65; p < 0.05 for all comparisons). Age, number of ICU beds, creatinine, lactate, arterial pH, and Pao(2)/Fio(2) ratio were the most important predictors in the eXtreme Gradient Boosting model. CONCLUSIONS: eXtreme Gradient Boosting had the highest discrimination overall, and our simple tool had higher discrimination than a modified Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, National Early Warning Score, and CURB-65 on external validation. These models could be used to improve triage decisions and clinical trial enrichment.","Churpek, Matthew M.; Gupta, Shruti; Spicer, Alexandra B.; Hayek, Salim S.; Srivastava, Anand; Chan, Lili; Melamed, Michal L.; Brenner, Samantha K.; Radbel, Jared; Madhani-Lovely, Farah; Bhatraju, Pavan K.; Bansal, Anip; Green, Adam; Goyal, Nitender; Shaefi, Shahzad; Parikh, Chirag R.; Semler, Matthew W.; Leaf, David E.",Crit Care Explor,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34476402/; https://doi.org/10.1097/cce.0000000000000515,52

However, molecular diagnostic capabilities are poorly developed in many African countries. Efforts by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and other public health agencies to scale up facilities for molecular testing across the continent are well documented, but there are few accounts from the laboratories at the frontline. INTERVENTION: As part of an institutional response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Benin City, Nigeria, signed a memorandum of understanding with a World Bank-supported institution to obtain a non-proprietary testing platform, renovated an existing molecular virology laboratory and validated the test process to make SARS-CoV-2 testing readily available for decision-making by frontline health workers. These efforts resulted in the University of Benin Teaching Hospital’s inclusion in the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control COVID-19 molecular laboratory network. The laboratory achieved a turnover of 12 123 tests within 7 months of operation. Challenges faced and dealt with include incompatible equipment, limited skilled manpower, unstable (unreliable) electric power supply, disrupted procurement and supply chain, and significant overhead costs. LESSONS LEARNT: Molecular diagnostic capability is essential in laboratory preparedness for pandemic response and can be achieved by establishing collaborative networks in low-resource settings.

Results did not support the parasite-stress theory at both the country and individual levels when controlling for a composite index of modernization. Across all analyses, modernization remained a significant predictor of values even when controlling for cultural similarity. No conclusions changed when using an alternative parasite stress estimate.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between undiagnosed SDB and the risk of ARDS and pulmonary abnormalities in a cohort of patients’ survivors of COVID-19 between 3 to 6 months after diagnosis. METHODS: Prospective cohort study of patients who developed ARDS during hospitalization due to COVID-19 compared with a control group of patients who had COVID-19 with mild to moderate symptoms. All patients were evaluated between the 12(th) and 24(th) week after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The evaluation includes persistent symptoms, lung diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO), chest CT scan and home sleep apnea test. SDB was diagnosed by the respiratory disturbance index ≥5 ev/h. The association between SDB and ARDS, the hazards of lung impairment and the hazard ratios (HR) were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 60 patients were included (ARDS: 34 patients, Control: 26 patients). The mean follow-up was 16 weeks (range 12-24). ARDS reported a high prevalence of SDB (79% vs. 38% in control group). A total of 35% reported DLCO impairment, and 67.6% abnormal chest CT. SDB was independently associated to ARDS, OR 6.72 (CI, 1.56 – 28.93), p <0.01, and abnormal Chest CT, HR 17.2 (CI, 1.68 – 177.4, p=0.01). Besides, ARDS, days in mechanical ventilation, male gender were also associated with an increased risk of abnormal chest CT. CONCLUSION: Undiagnosed SDB is prevalent and independently associated with ARDS. In addition, undiagnosed SDB increased the hazard of abnormal Chest CT in the midterm.

Sociodemographic characteristics, and work/training experience were reported; IPC knowledge and practices were assessed by questionnaire. Data of 308 valid responses were analyzed. Percentage of correct responses to nine IPC knowledge questions and frequent adherence to 11 IPC practices were calculated. IPC knowledge and practice scores were developed by using principal component analyses; individual scores were classified into high/low level of knowledge or practices by the median of the scores. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate associations between IPC knowledge or practice scores and sociodemographic or work/training variables. RESULTS: Majority of the participants were females (89.3%). Significant associations between high education level and high level of IPC knowledge (AOR = 2.72, 95% CI = 1.45-5.10) and practices (AOR = 3.66, 95% CI = 1.90-7.05) were observed, after controlling the influence of sociodemographic and work/training variables. CONCLUSION: High scores for IPC knowledge and IPC practices were independently associated with nurses’ high level of education, regardless of their nationality or previous working experience. Further studies to develop effective programs for IPC regardless of the nurses’ educational attainment are recommended.","ALOJAIMY, RUEDA SALEH; NAKAMURA, KEIKO; AL-SOBAIHI, SABER; TASHIRO, YURI; WATANABE, NOZOMI; SEINO, KAORUKO",J Prev Med Hyg,https://doi.org/10.15167/2421-4248/jpmh2021.62.2.1957; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34604592/,52

From a gender perspective, compared to women, men’s diets tend to be less healthy and sustainable. This is linked to worse health outcomes for men. Therefore, alternative, more ethical ways of eating that have the potential to improve men’s health and well-being and simultaneously contribute to better public health and sustainability outcomes should be encouraged. Veganism addresses issues of food, health, climate change, and animal justice simultaneously. This article explores vegan men’s food practices in relation to health and well-being, drawing on qualitative interviews with 61 vegan men. The interview material was analyzed using the method of thematic analysis. Our findings suggest that becoming vegan encourages positive changes in men’s health behavior. This includes paying more attention to nutrition and taking better care of one’s health. Vegan men report experiencing better physical and mental well-being upon going vegan. Based on these findings, we argue that vegan men’s food and health practices contribute to the emergence of healthier masculinities, as vegan men help to challenge links between risky health behavior and masculinity.","Aavik, Kadri; Velgan, Marta",Am J Mens Health,https://doi.org/10.1177/15579883211044323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34528467/,52

Clinical manifestations vary widely among patients with MIS-C, and the aim of this study was to investigate factors associated with severe outcomes. METHODS: In this retrospective surveillance study, patients who met the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition for MIS-C (younger than 21 years, fever, laboratory evidence of inflammation, admitted to hospital, multisystem [≥2] organ involvement [cardiac, renal, respiratory, haematological, gastrointestinal, dermatological, or neurological], no alternative plausible diagnosis, and either laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR, serology, or antigen test, or known COVID-19 exposure within 4 weeks before symptom onset) were reported from state and local health departments to the CDC using standard case-report forms. Factors assessed for potential links to severe outcomes included pre-existing patient factors (sex, age, race or ethnicity, obesity, and MIS-C symptom onset date before June 1, 2020) and clinical findings (signs or symptoms and laboratory markers). Logistic regression models, adjusted for all pre-existing factors, were used to estimate odds ratios between potential explanatory factors and the following outcomes: intensive care unit (ICU) admission, shock, decreased cardiac function, myocarditis, and coronary artery abnormalities. FINDINGS: 1080 patients met the CDC case definition for MIS-C and had symptom onset between March 11 and Oct 10, 2020. ICU admission was more likely in patients aged 6–12 years (adjusted odds ratio 1·9 [95% CI 1·4–2·6) and patients aged 13–20 years (2·6 [1·8–3·8]), compared with patients aged 0–5 years, and more likely in non-Hispanic Black patients, compared with non-Hispanic White patients (1·6 [1·0–2·4]). ICU admission was more likely for patients with shortness of breath (1·9 [1·2–2·9]), abdominal pain (1·7 [1·2–2·7]), and patients with increased concentrations of C-reactive protein, troponin, ferritin, D-dimer, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-terminal pro B-type BNP, or interleukin-6, or reduced platelet or lymphocyte counts. We found similar associations for decreased cardiac function, shock, and myocarditis. Coronary artery abnormalities were more common in male patients (1·5 [1·1–2·1]) than in female patients and patients with mucocutaneous lesions (2·2 [1·3–3·5]) or conjunctival injection (2·3 [1·4–3·7]). INTERPRETATION: Identification of important demographic and clinical characteristics could aid in early recognition and prompt management of severe outcomes for patients with MIS-C.

RVA strains are antigenically heterogeneous, and are classified in multiple G and P types defined by the two outer capsid proteins, VP7 and VP4, respectively. This study summarizes published literature on the genetic and antigenic diversity of porcine and bovine RVA strains published over the last 3 decades. The single most prevalent genotype combination among porcine RVA strains was G5P[7], whereas the predominant genotype combination among bovine RVA strains was G6P[5], although spatiotemporal differences in RVA strain distribution were observed. These data provide important baseline data on epidemiologically important RVA strains in swine and cattle and may guide the development of more effective vaccines for veterinary use.","Papp, Hajnalka; László, Brigitta; Jakab, Ferenc; Ganesh, Balasubramanian; De Grazia, Simona; Matthijnssens, Jelle; Ciarlet, Max; Martella, Vito; Bányai, Krisztián",Vet Microbiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113513001909; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2013.03.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23642647/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113513001909,52
689010,Global translational landscape of the Candida albicans morphological transition,2020-12-24,"This study theoretically investigated detachment of homoaggregates and heteroaggregates attached on the planar surfaces at primary minima during transients in solution chemistry. The homoaggregates were represented as small colloidal clusters with well-defined structures or as clusters generated by randomly packing spheres using Monte Carlo method. The heteroaggregates were modeled as microparticles coated with nanoparticles. Surface element integration technique was adopted to calculate Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (DLVO) interaction energies for the homoaggregates and heteroaggregates at different ionic strengths. Results show that attached homoaggregates on the planar surface at primary minima are irreversible to reduction in solution ionic strength whether the primary spheres of the homoaggregates are nano- or micro-sized. Heteroaggregation of nanoparticles with a microparticle can cause DLVO interaction energy to decrease monotonically with separation distance at low ionic strengths (e.g., ⩽0.01 M), indicating that the heteroaggregates experience repulsive forces at all separation distances. Therefore, attachment of the heteroaggregates at primary minima can be detached upon reduction in ionic strength. Additionally, we showed that the adhesive forces and torques that the aforementioned heteroaggregates experience can be significantly smaller than those experienced by the microspheres without attaching nanoparticles, thus, the heteroaggregates are readily detached via hydrodynamic drag. Results of study provide plausible explanation for the observations in the literature that attached/aggregated particles can be detached/redispersed from primary minima upon reduction in ionic strength, which challenges the common belief that attachment/aggregation of particles in primary minima is chemically irreversible.","Shen, Chongyang; Wu, Lei; Zhang, Shiwen; Ye, Huichun; Li, Baoguo; Huang, Yuanfang",J Colloid Interface Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021979714000563; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2014.01.033; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021979714000563; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24594038/,52
689564,The evolution of HIV: Inferences using phylogenetics,2011-11-26,"Assessment of humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious agents is typically restricted to detecting antigen-specific antibody in the serum. Rarely does immune monitoring entail assessment of the memory B cell compartment itself, although it is these cells that engage in secondary antibody responses capable of mediating immune protection when pre-existing antibodies fail to prevent re-infection. There are few techniques that are capable of detecting rare antigen-specific B cells while also providing information regarding their precursory frequency, class/subclass usage and functional affinity. In theory, the ELISPOT/FluoroSpot (collectively ImmunoSpot) assay platform is ideally-suited for antigen-specific B cell assessments since it provides this information at single-cell resolution for individual antibody-secreting cells (ASC). Here, we tested the hypothesis that antigen coating efficiency could be universally improved across a diverse set of viral antigens if the standard direct (non-specific, low affinity) antigen absorption to the membrane was substituted by high affinity capture. Specifically, we report an enhancement in assay sensitivity and a reduction in required protein concentrations through the capture of recombinant proteins via their encoded hexahistidine (6XHis) affinity tag. Affinity tag antigen coating enabled detection of SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor binding domain (RBD)-reactive ASC, and also significantly improved assay performance using additional control antigens. Collectively, establishment of a universal antigen coating approach streamlines characterization of the memory B cell compartment after SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 vaccinations, and facilitates high-throughput immune monitoring efforts of large donor cohorts in general.","Wolf, C.; Koppert, S.; Becza, N.; Sautto, G.

BACKGROUND: The COVID‐19 outbreak has posed great threat to public health worldwide. Nurses fighting against the epidemic on the frontline might be under great physical and psychological distress. This psychological distress was predominantly described as sleep disturbance, symptoms of anxiety and depression, posttraumatic stress, inability to make decisions and even somatic symptoms. DESIGN: Cross‐sectional study. METHODS: Frontline nurses from designated hospitals for COVID‐19 patients were invited to complete an online survey by convenience sampling, the survey included six main sections: the General Health Questionnaire, the Perceived Social Support Scale, the Simplified Coping Style Scale, the Impact of Event Scale‐Revised, socio‐demographic, occupation and work history. Multiple logistic analysis was used to identify the potential risk factors of psychological distress. The study methods were compliant with the STROBE checklist. RESULTS: Of the 263 frontline nurses, 66 (25.1%) were identified as psychological distress. Multiple logistic analysis revealed that working in emergency department, concern for family, being treated differently, negative coping style and COVID‐19 related stress symptom were positive related to psychological distress. Perceived more social support and effective precautionary measures were negatively associated with psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that COVID‐19 had a significant psychological impact on frontline nurses. Early detection of psychological distress and supportive intervention should be taken according to the associated factors to prevent more serious psychological impact on frontline nurses. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study highlighted that the frontline nurses were suffering from varying degrees of psychological distress, which needed early screening and supportive intervention for preventing more serious psychological impact on frontline nurses. Beside, more specific measurement should be combined with the GHQ‐12 to assess the varying degrees of psychological distress in frontline nurses.","Nie, Anliu; Su, Xiangfen; Zhang, Shuzeng; Guan, Wenjie; Li, Jianfeng",J Clin Nurs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32786150/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15454,52

Despite similarities to the challenges confronted in developed countries, Latin American governments face these problems amplified by structural obstacles such as social inequalities. These countries need to respond with capacities and resources often limited by spoils systems, as well as social and political polarization. In this context, we provide an overview of some innovative practices happening in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and México. In particular, we concentrate on some salient collaborative efforts in the region. To draw some lessons from these practices, we focus on the formal and informal institutions that facilitate or obstruct collaborations across jurisdictions.

University students living in school compound with groups and sharing a common cafeteria are more susceptible to contract and spread the virus. Risk perception multiplies fear and anxiety that triggers precautionary action. However, research is scant in this particular field. OBJECTIVE: To assess the perceived risk of COVID-19 and its associated factors among University Students in Northeast Ethiopia during school reopening. METHODS: Institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 682 Debre Berhan University students from December 1–15, 2020, when students just get back to school. Data was collected using a structured and pre-tested questionnaire. A multistage sampling technique was used to select study subjects. Data were cleaned and entered into Epi-Data version 4.6 and exported to SPSS version 25 software for analysis. Descriptive statistics, bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis were run to summarize the results. RESULTS: The overall perceived risk of COVID-19 was 296 (43.4%), 95% CI (39.4–47.4). Age (AOR (CI) =3.27 (1.87–5.71), open relationship (AOR (CI) =3.17 (1.73–5.79), fathers’ education (AOR (CI) =2.29 (1.31–4.02), having diabetes (AOR (CI) =2.64 (1.15–6.07), and information source from ministry of health (MOH) (AOR (CI) =1.87 (1.27–2.75) had significantly high-risk perception. However, students who use Facebook (AOR (CI) =0.57 (0.39–0.82) and Websites/articles (AOR (CI) =0.14 (0.06–0.34) had significantly low-risk perception. Television (59.8%) and Telegram (66.6%) were the primary sources of information, while the World Health Organization (68.3%) was the most trusted source of information. CONCLUSION: University students perceived a low risk towards COVID-19 pandemics at the time of school resumption. It was influenced by students’ demographic characteristics, co-morbidities, social media, and information sources. The Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education should properly promote risk communication among university students.","Tadese, Mesfin; Haile, Assalif Beyene; Moltot, Tebabere; Silesh, Mulualem",Infect Drug Resist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737817/; https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s302126,52
