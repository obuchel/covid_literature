65542,"Components of a hyperthermia clinic: recommendations for staffing, equipment, and treatment monitoring.",2014,"OBJECTIVE In the face of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) physical distancing mandates, community-engaged research (CER) faces new vulnerabilities in the equitable inclusion of communities within research partnerships aiming to address these very inequities. METHODS We convened a series of virtual meetings with our CER partnership to discuss the current state of activities and to identify considerations for remote community engagement. We outlined and expanded recommendations through iterative, partnered discussions to inform protections against new CER susceptibilities. RESULTS This article presents CER recommendations in translational COVID-19 research for health equity, including increasing accessibility for remote engagement, promoting opportunities for bi-directional knowledge exchange, committing to a community-centered workforce, and leveraging novel opportunities within community-academic partnerships. CONCLUSION Researchers conducting CER face an opportunity to reimagine community engagement remotely for partnered resilience to ensure the voices of the most affected are appropriately and inclusively integrated into all aspects of decision-making within the COVID-19 research, practice, and policymaking continuum.","Carson, Savanna L; Gonzalez, Cynthia; Lopez, Sylvia; Morris, D'Ann; Mtume, Norma; Lucas-Wright, Aziza; Vassar, Stefanie D; Norris, Keith C; Brown, Arleen F",Journal of health care for the poor and underserved,https://doi.org/10.1353/hpu.2020.0112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33416732/,873
79405,Heat transfer within hydrodissection fluids: An analysis of thermal conduction and convection using liquid and gel materials.,2015,"COVID-19 is mainly an infectious disease of the respiratory system transmitted through air droplets and pulmonary symptoms constitute main presentations of this disease. However, COVID-19 demonstrates a clinically diverse manifestation ranging from asymptomatic presentation to critically illness with severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, or multiple organ failure. Accumulating evidences demonstrated that COVID-19 has extrapulmonary involvement, including neurological, smelling sensation, cardiovascular, digestive, hepatobiliary, renal, endocrinologic, dermatologic system, and others. Over a third of COVID-19 patients manifest a wide range of neurological symptoms involving the central/peripheral nervous system. Underlying cardiovascular comorbidities were associated with detrimental outcomes, meanwhile the occurrence of cardiovascular complications correlate to poor survival. Gastrointestinal symptoms frequently occur and have been associated with a longer period of illness. Impaired hepatic functions were associated with the severity of the disease. Higher rate of acute kidney injury was reported in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Endocrinologic presentations of COVID-19 include exacerbating hyperglycemia, euglycemic ketosis and diabetic ketoacidosis. The most common cutaneous manifestation was acro-cutaneous (pernio or chilblain-like) lesions, and other skin lesions consist of maculopapular rash, vesicular lesions, livedoid/necrotic lesions, exanthematous rashes, and petechiae. This review article summarized the general clinical signs and symptoms, radiologic features, and disease manifestation with progression in patients with COVID-19.","Tsai, Ping-Hsing; Lai, Wei-Yi; Lin, Yi-Ying; Luo, Yung-Hung; Lin, Yi-Tsung; Chen, Hsiao-Kang; Chen, Yuh-Min; Lai, Yi-Chun; Kuo, Li-Chiao; Chen, Shew-Dan; Chang, Kao-Jung; Liu, Cheng-Hsuan; Chang, Shih-Chieh; Wang, Fu-Der; Yang, Yi-Ping",Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,https://doi.org/10.1097/jcma.0000000000000463; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33230062/,873
96747,In vivo determination of a modified heat capacity of small hepatocellular carcinomas prior to radiofrequency ablation: correlation with adjacent vasculature and tumour recurrence.,2012,"BACKGROUND Patients on haemodialysis (HD) have a decreased physical and functional capacity. Several studies have reported the beneficial effects of exercise on the physical, functional and psychological functioning of HD patients. Despite these results, exercise programmes on HD are not commonplace. OBJECTIVE To analyse the effect of an intradialysis endurance training programme on muscular strength and functional capacity in our HD patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS A 6-month single-centre prospective study. HD patients were non-randomly assigned to an exercise group (group E) or a control group (group C). Exercise training included complete endurance training using balls, weights and elastic bands in the first 2 h of an HD session; group C received standard HD care. Analysed data: (1) biochemical parameters; (2) biceps and quadriceps muscle tone, maximum quadriceps length strength (MQLS) and dominant hand grip (HG); (3) functional capacity tests: sit-to-stand-to-sit (STS10) and 6-min walking test (6MWT). RESULTS Forty patients were included, 55% were men; their mean age was 68.4 years; the patients were 61.6 months on HD; 16 patients were in group E and 24 in group C. In group E, muscular strength showed a significant improvement in MQLS (15.6 ± 10.7 vs. 17.7 ± 12.5 kg, p < 0.05) and HG (22.1 ± 13.2 vs. 24.1 ± 15.8 kg, p < 0.05) at the end of the programme, while a global decrease was reported in group C (MQLS 20.9 ± 9.3 vs. 16.2 ± 8.4 kg, p < 0.05; HG 25.1 ± 10.3 vs. 24.1 ± 11.1 kg). 6MWT significantly improved in group E (20%, 293.1 vs. 368 m, p < 0.001) and decreased in group C (10%, 350 vs. 315 m, p < 0.004). At the end of the programme, STS10 time was reduced in group E (2.1 ± 18.5 vs. 28.7 ± 20.6 s), while it rose in group C (31.5 ± 17.9 vs. 36.4 ± 19.8 s), though significant differences were not found. CONCLUSIONS (1) The intradialysis training programme improved muscular strength and functional capacity in our HD patients. (2) These results support the benefits of exercise training for HD patients. (3) Nephrologists should consider exercise training as a standard practice for the care of HD patients.","Esteve Simó, Vicent; Junqué, Anna; Fulquet, Miquel; Duarte, Verónica; Saurina, Anna; Pou, Mónica; Moreno, Fátima; Carneiro, Jose; Ramírez de Arellano, Manel",Nephron.

145243,Radiofrequency-induced heating versus mechanical stapler for pancreatic stump closure: in vivo comparative study.,2016,"BACKGROUND Unlike for extremity sarcomas, the efficacy of radiotherapy for retroperitoneal sarcoma is not established. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of preoperative radiotherapy plus surgery versus surgery alone on abdominal recurrence-free survival. METHODS EORTC-62092 is an open-label, randomised, phase 3 study done in 31 research institutions, hospitals, and cancer centres in 13 countries in Europe and North America. Adults (aged ≥18 years) with histologically documented, localised, primary retroperitoneal sarcoma that was operable and suitable for radiotherapy, who had not been previously treated and had a WHO performance status and American Society of Anesthesiologists score of 2 or lower, were centrally randomly assigned (1:1), using an interactive web response system and a minimisation algorithm, to receive either surgery alone or preoperative radiotherapy followed by surgery. Randomisation was stratified by hospital and performance status. Radiotherapy was delivered as 50·4 Gy (in 28 daily fractions of 1·8 Gy) in either 3D conformal radiotherapy or intensity modulated radiotherapy, and the objective of surgery was a macroscopically complete resection of the tumour mass with en-bloc organ resection as necessary. The primary endpoint was abdominal recurrence-free survival, as assessed by the investigator, and was analysed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was analysed in all patients who started their allocated treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01344018. FINDINGS Between Jan 18, 2012 and April 10, 2017, 266 patients were enrolled, of whom 133 were randomly assigned to each group. The median follow-up was 43·1 months (IQR 28·8-59·2). 128 (96%) patients from the surgery alone group had surgery, and 119 (89%) patients in the radiotherapy and surgery group had both radiotherapy and surgery. Median abdominal recurrence-free survival was 4·5 years (95% CI 3·9 to not estimable) in the radiotherapy plus surgery group and 5·0 years (3·4 to not estimable) in the surgery only group (hazard ratio 1·01, 95% CI 0·71-1·44; log rank p=0·95). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were lymphopenia (98 [77%] of 127 patients in the radiotherapy plus surgery group vs one [1%] of 128 patients in the surgery alone group), anaemia (15 [12%] vs ten [8%]), and hypoalbuminaemia (15 [12%] vs five [4%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 30 (24%) of 127 patients in the radiotherapy plus surgery group, and in 13 (10%) of 128 patients in the surgery alone group. One (1%) of 127 patients in the radiotherapy plus surgery group died due to treatment-related serious adverse events (gastropleural fistula), and no patients in the surgery alone group died due to treatment-related serious adverse events. INTERPRETATION Preoperative radiotherapy should not be considered as standard of care treatment for retroperitoneal sarcoma.
